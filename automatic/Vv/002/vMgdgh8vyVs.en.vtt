00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
hi there again this is a video now about

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.750 
hi there again this is a video now about
how<00:00:07.589> I<00:00:07.620> use<00:00:07.980> AB<00:00:08.400> kids<00:00:09.150> with<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.660> iPad<00:00:10.520> to<00:00:11.520> just

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:11.760 
how I use AB kids with the iPad to just

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.910 
how I use AB kids with the iPad to just
channel<00:00:12.270> it<00:00:12.299> in<00:00:12.539> the<00:00:12.629> studio<00:00:12.869> so<00:00:13.680> the<00:00:13.770> way<00:00:13.889> I

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
channel it in the studio so the way I

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.760 
channel it in the studio so the way I
set<00:00:14.279> this<00:00:14.430> up<00:00:14.610> is<00:00:14.820> I<00:00:15.029> connected<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:16.109> guitar<00:00:16.500> to

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
set this up is I connected the guitar to

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.269 
set this up is I connected the guitar to
advocate<00:00:17.400> link<00:00:17.779> which<00:00:18.779> goes<00:00:19.020> into<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.830> iPad

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
advocate link which goes into the iPad

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.310 
advocate link which goes into the iPad
and<00:00:20.580> I've<00:00:21.000> got<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.269> iPad<00:00:21.539> standing<00:00:22.050> on<00:00:22.140> its

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
and I've got the iPad standing on its

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.880 
and I've got the iPad standing on its
iPad<00:00:22.800> stand<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.429> instead<00:00:23.759> of<00:00:23.939> going<00:00:24.269> out<00:00:24.509> of

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
iPad stand and instead of going out of

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.769 
iPad stand and instead of going out of
the<00:00:25.890> audio<00:00:26.130> output<00:00:26.339> of<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.759> UM<00:00:26.849> cute<00:00:27.150> link<00:00:27.480> I'm

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
the audio output of the UM cute link I'm

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.390 
the audio output of the UM cute link I'm
going<00:00:28.439> out<00:00:28.679> of<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.009> back<00:00:29.249> of<00:00:29.960> the<00:00:30.960> iPad<00:00:31.710> dog

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:32.400 
going out of the back of the iPad dog

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.319 
going out of the back of the iPad dog
here

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
here

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.440 
here
and<00:00:33.690> straight<00:00:34.440> into<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:35.300> powered<00:00:36.300> monitors

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
and straight into the powered monitors

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.890 
and straight into the powered monitors
and<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:38.010> advantage<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.610> doing<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.300> that

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900 
and the advantage of doing that is that

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.380 
and the advantage of doing that is that
you<00:00:40.260> get<00:00:40.440> much<00:00:40.680> less<00:00:40.980> crosstalk<00:00:41.610> in<00:00:42.000> between

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
you get much less crosstalk in between

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.080 
you get much less crosstalk in between
those<00:00:42.930> channels<00:00:43.380> and<00:00:44.100> basically<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.910> sound

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
those channels and basically the sound

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.800 
those channels and basically the sound
is<00:00:45.270> better<00:00:46.700> the<00:00:47.700> trick<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.240> get<00:00:48.390> this<00:00:48.540> working

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:48.810 
is better the trick to get this working

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.100 
is better the trick to get this working
is<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.290> first<00:00:50.100> plug<00:00:50.610> in<00:00:50.820> advocate<00:00:51.600> link<00:00:51.870> and

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
is to first plug in advocate link and

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.180 
is to first plug in advocate link and
only<00:00:52.440> afterwards

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
only afterwards

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.770 
only afterwards
plug<00:00:53.580> in<00:00:53.790> the<00:00:54.500> the<00:00:55.500> cable<00:00:55.920> into<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.700> iPad<00:00:57.480> dock

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
plug in the the cable into the iPad dock

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.270 
plug in the the cable into the iPad dock
and<00:00:58.050> then<00:00:58.230> turn<00:00:58.440> on<00:00:58.560> your<00:00:58.710> speaker's<00:01:00.500> sound<00:01:01.500> so

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
and then turn on your speaker's sound so

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.759 
and then turn on your speaker's sound so
one<00:01:03.150> of<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.360> things<00:01:03.600> that's<00:01:03.780> it's<00:01:04.229> quite<00:01:04.470> neat

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
one of the things that's it's quite neat

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.279 
one of the things that's it's quite neat
about<00:01:04.949> amp<00:01:05.339> kit<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.689> can<00:01:06.900> record

00:01:07.279 --> 00:01:07.289 
about amp kit is that you can record

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:10.190 
about amp kit is that you can record
yourself<00:01:07.920> while<00:01:08.579> playing<00:01:09.420> while<00:01:09.630> playing<00:01:09.840> so

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
yourself while playing while playing so

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:50.300 
yourself while playing while playing so
yeah

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.270 

so<00:01:51.310> that<00:01:51.430> is<00:01:51.550> now<00:01:51.700> recorded<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:53.470> then<00:01:53.920> you<00:01:54.070> can

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
so that is now recorded and then you can

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.970 
so that is now recorded and then you can
use<00:01:54.910> that<00:01:55.120> recording<00:01:55.630> as<00:01:55.750> a<00:01:55.780> backing<00:01:56.230> track<00:01:56.260> to

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:56.980 
use that recording as a backing track to

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:41.500 
use that recording as a backing track to
play<00:01:57.190> along

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.360 

which<00:02:42.510> is<00:02:42.660> a<00:02:42.989> very<00:02:43.410> nice<00:02:43.709> way<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.069> start

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
which is a very nice way to start

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.120 
which is a very nice way to start
jamming<00:02:45.239> and<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:45.840> laying<00:02:46.470> down<00:02:46.739> some<00:02:46.980> basic

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
jamming and and laying down some basic

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.610 
jamming and and laying down some basic
tracks<00:02:47.610> and<00:02:47.880> playing<00:02:48.150> on<00:02:48.300> top<00:02:48.480> of<00:02:48.630> it<00:02:48.750> it<00:02:49.470> would

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
tracks and playing on top of it it would

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.110 
tracks and playing on top of it it would
be<00:02:49.739> nice<00:02:49.920> though<00:02:49.950> to<00:02:50.340> be<00:02:50.459> able<00:02:50.550> to<00:02:50.730> record

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
be nice though to be able to record

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.729 
be nice though to be able to record
multiple<00:02:51.360> layers<00:02:51.810> and<00:02:51.959> to<00:02:52.230> have<00:02:52.410> it<00:02:52.530> loop

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
multiple layers and to have it loop

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.430 
multiple layers and to have it loop
automatically<00:02:53.400> I<00:02:54.090> kind<00:02:54.840> of<00:02:54.930> suspect<00:02:55.319> that

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
automatically I kind of suspect that

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.260 
automatically I kind of suspect that
that<00:02:55.500> will<00:02:55.830> come<00:02:56.069> in<00:02:56.190> in<00:02:56.580> a<00:02:56.670> future<00:02:57.030> version

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
that will come in in a future version

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.199 
that will come in in a future version
this<00:02:57.600> is<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:58.200> first<00:02:58.709> version<00:02:58.950> of<00:02:59.250> this<00:02:59.430> amp

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
this is the first version of this amp

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.470 
this is the first version of this amp
kit<00:03:00.780> amp<00:03:01.610> so<00:03:02.610> one<00:03:02.790> of<00:03:02.819> the<00:03:03.060> things<00:03:03.300> that<00:03:03.450> I

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
kit amp so one of the things that I

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.120 
kit amp so one of the things that I
really<00:03:03.750> love<00:03:03.900> about<00:03:03.930> it<00:03:04.350> is<00:03:04.500> that<00:03:04.709> there's

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
really love about it is that there's

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.360 
really love about it is that there's
virtually<00:03:05.430> no<00:03:06.170> background<00:03:07.170> noise<00:03:07.680> when<00:03:08.160> you

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
virtually no background noise when you

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.280 
virtually no background noise when you
when<00:03:08.610> you<00:03:08.700> play<00:03:09.000> on

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.119 

so<00:03:14.280> I'm<00:03:14.370> not<00:03:14.489> an<00:03:14.640> app<00:03:14.790> noise<00:03:15.150> gate<00:03:15.450> here<00:03:16.129> just

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
so I'm not an app noise gate here just

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:18.619 
so I'm not an app noise gate here just
for<00:03:17.400> when<00:03:17.580> I've<00:03:17.700> got<00:03:17.849> playing<00:03:18.180> with<00:03:18.360> a<00:03:18.390> lead

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:18.629 
for when I've got playing with a lead

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:21.770 
for when I've got playing with a lead
sound<00:03:18.930> but<00:03:19.349> for<00:03:19.590> regular<00:03:20.069> plain<00:03:20.599> walls<00:03:21.599> you

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
sound but for regular plain walls you

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.070 
sound but for regular plain walls you
don't<00:03:21.959> really<00:03:22.080> get<00:03:22.640> and<00:03:23.640> then<00:03:24.420> there<00:03:24.629> is<00:03:24.780> some

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
don't really get and then there is some

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.789 
don't really get and then there is some
kind<00:03:25.290> of<00:03:25.440> a<00:03:25.560> feedback<00:03:26.030> protection<00:03:27.650> that<00:03:28.650> you

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
kind of a feedback protection that you

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:33.110 
kind of a feedback protection that you
can<00:03:28.950> turn<00:03:29.159> off<00:03:29.370> here<00:03:30.239> or<00:03:30.720> is<00:03:31.170> it<00:03:31.610> here<00:03:32.610> that<00:03:33.000> you

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
can turn off here or is it here that you

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.479 
can turn off here or is it here that you
can<00:03:33.299> turn<00:03:33.510> on<00:03:33.780> but<00:03:34.290> I'm<00:03:34.440> actually<00:03:34.860> never<00:03:35.190> using

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
can turn on but I'm actually never using

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.600 
can turn on but I'm actually never using
it<00:03:35.610> because<00:03:35.910> I<00:03:35.940> like<00:03:36.330> the<00:03:36.540> crisp<00:03:36.780> sound<00:03:37.140> of<00:03:37.620> the

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
it because I like the crisp sound of the

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.270 
it because I like the crisp sound of the
Christmas<00:03:39.390> of<00:03:39.510> a<00:03:39.569> clean<00:03:39.780> guitar<00:03:40.170> sound<00:03:40.500> so

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
Christmas of a clean guitar sound so

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.100 
Christmas of a clean guitar sound so
obviously<00:03:41.970> if<00:03:42.180> you<00:03:42.299> if<00:03:42.629> you<00:03:42.720> turn<00:03:42.930> on<00:03:42.959> the

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
obviously if you if you turn on the

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.199 
obviously if you if you turn on the
noise<00:03:43.409> filter<00:03:43.799> and<00:03:44.099> feedback<00:03:44.519> filter<00:03:44.700> you<00:03:45.060> get

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
noise filter and feedback filter you get

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.270 
noise filter and feedback filter you get
a<00:03:45.450> reduction<00:03:45.900> in<00:03:46.319> treble<00:03:46.650> and<00:03:46.950> in<00:03:47.069> higher

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
a reduction in treble and in higher

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.960 
a reduction in treble and in higher
sounds<00:03:48.260> so<00:03:49.260> that's<00:03:49.680> one<00:03:49.860> way<00:03:51.230> that<00:03:52.230> I<00:03:52.290> use<00:03:52.650> this

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
sounds so that's one way that I use this

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.650 
sounds so that's one way that I use this
and<00:03:53.970> kit<00:03:54.239> and<00:03:55.109> kit<00:03:55.620> have<00:03:55.890> a<00:03:56.459> lot<00:03:57.239> of<00:03:57.329> the<00:03:57.420> thing

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
and kit and kit have a lot of the thing

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.059 
and kit and kit have a lot of the thing
that<00:03:57.840> I<00:03:57.870> do<00:03:57.989> with<00:03:58.230> it<00:03:58.379> is<00:03:58.560> basically<00:03:58.680> to

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
that I do with it is basically to

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.960 
that I do with it is basically to
rehearse<00:03:59.790> my<00:04:00.060> band<00:04:00.269> songs<00:04:00.720> so<00:04:01.410> I<00:04:02.010> prepared

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
rehearse my band songs so I prepared

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.630 
rehearse my band songs so I prepared
some<00:04:03.239> backing<00:04:03.510> tracks<00:04:03.870> without<00:04:04.049> guitar<00:04:04.640> for

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
some backing tracks without guitar for

00:04:05.640 --> 00:05:11.260 
some backing tracks without guitar for
example<00:04:06.000> this<00:04:06.120> song

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.879 

so<00:05:12.270> that's<00:05:12.449> a<00:05:12.539> nice<00:05:12.689> way<00:05:12.719> of<00:05:13.020> being<00:05:13.500> able<00:05:13.620> to

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:13.889 
so that's a nice way of being able to

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:16.040 
so that's a nice way of being able to
rehearse<00:05:14.539> even<00:05:15.539> when<00:05:15.629> you're<00:05:15.750> on<00:05:15.810> the<00:05:15.930> road

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
rehearse even when you're on the road

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.450 
rehearse even when you're on the road
you<00:05:16.289> just<00:05:16.439> take<00:05:16.620> your<00:05:16.740> backing<00:05:16.919> tracks<00:05:17.250> with

you just take your backing tracks with

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.300
