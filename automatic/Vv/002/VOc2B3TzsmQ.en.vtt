tell<00:00:01.030> us<00:00:01.150> about<00:00:01.270> this<00:00:01.540> new<00:00:01.599> light<00:00:02.170> rail<00:00:02.200> camera

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:02.889 
tell us about this new light rail camera

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:05.250 
tell us about this new light rail camera
in<00:00:03.010> and<00:00:03.280> why<00:00:03.610> is<00:00:03.669> it<00:00:03.790> so<00:00:03.969> different<00:00:04.180> from<00:00:05.020> other

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:05.260 
in and why is it so different from other

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.280 
in and why is it so different from other
cameras<00:00:05.800> in<00:00:05.890> the<00:00:05.980> past<00:00:06.330> so<00:00:07.330> this<00:00:07.480> new<00:00:07.930> electric

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:08.290 
cameras in the past so this new electric

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.680 
cameras in the past so this new electric
camera<00:00:08.650> is<00:00:08.830> the<00:00:09.040> first<00:00:09.309> consumer<00:00:09.759> light<00:00:10.419> field

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:10.690 
camera is the first consumer light field

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.779 
camera is the first consumer light field
camera<00:00:10.809> available<00:00:11.530> the<00:00:12.429> reason<00:00:12.669> that's

camera available the reason that's

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:14.009 
camera available the reason that's
important<00:00:13.240> is<00:00:13.329> because<00:00:13.389> although

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:14.019 
important is because although

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:15.810 
important is because although

digital cameras of today are

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.610 
digital cameras of today are
fundamentally<00:00:25.150> the<00:00:25.570> same<00:00:25.600> I<00:00:26.110> mean<00:00:26.260> they<00:00:26.410> they

information<00:00:29.170> so<00:00:29.740> the<00:00:30.040> big<00:00:30.340> breakthrough<00:00:30.940> here

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.330 
information so the big breakthrough here

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.360 
information so the big breakthrough here
in<00:00:32.110> producing<00:00:32.439> a<00:00:32.529> light<00:00:32.649> field<00:00:32.859> camera<00:00:32.920> is

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
in producing a light field camera is

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.509 
in producing a light field camera is
that<00:00:33.399> we<00:00:33.730> capture<00:00:34.359> a<00:00:34.539> much<00:00:34.780> richer<00:00:35.739> set<00:00:36.460> of

00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:36.519 
that we capture a much richer set of

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:38.250 
that we capture a much richer set of
information<00:00:37.149> from<00:00:37.329> the<00:00:37.480> real<00:00:37.629> world<00:00:37.660> in<00:00:38.109> fact

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
information from the real world in fact

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.569 
information from the real world in fact
what<00:00:38.469> we're<00:00:38.589> capturing<00:00:38.769> is<00:00:39.100> called<00:00:39.309> the<00:00:39.429> light

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:39.579 
what we're capturing is called the light

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:41.880 
what we're capturing is called the light
field<00:00:39.850> and<00:00:40.089> the<00:00:40.839> light<00:00:40.960> field<00:00:41.199> is<00:00:41.409> all<00:00:41.649> of<00:00:41.800> the

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
field and the light field is all of the

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.770 
field and the light field is all of the
light<00:00:42.070> moving<00:00:42.699> in<00:00:42.909> every<00:00:43.120> direction<00:00:43.269> and

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
light moving in every direction and

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.470 
light moving in every direction and
every<00:00:44.499> point<00:00:44.679> in<00:00:44.800> space<00:00:44.829> so<00:00:45.819> that's<00:00:46.239> sort<00:00:46.359> of

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
every point in space so that's sort of

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.509 
every point in space so that's sort of
this<00:00:46.600> lofty<00:00:46.870> definition<00:00:47.620> what<00:00:48.069> it<00:00:48.159> allows<00:00:48.339> us

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:48.519 
this lofty definition what it allows us

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:50.700 
this lofty definition what it allows us
to<00:00:48.609> do<00:00:48.789> is<00:00:49.089> preserve<00:00:49.780> the<00:00:50.109> direction<00:00:50.409> of<00:00:50.649> light

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
to do is preserve the direction of light

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.279 
to do is preserve the direction of light
at<00:00:51.129> every<00:00:51.699> point<00:00:51.879> of<00:00:52.059> capture<00:00:52.479> now<00:00:53.050> for

00:00:53.279 --> 00:00:53.289 
at every point of capture now for

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:55.410 
at every point of capture now for
consumers<00:00:53.739> what<00:00:54.489> that<00:00:54.640> means<00:00:54.819> is<00:00:54.999> you<00:00:55.149> can<00:00:55.300> do

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
consumers what that means is you can do

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.779 
consumers what that means is you can do
things<00:00:55.600> like<00:00:55.749> refocus<00:00:56.620> pictures<00:00:57.339> after

00:00:57.779 --> 00:00:57.789 
things like refocus pictures after

00:00:57.789 --> 00:00:59.369 
things like refocus pictures after
you've<00:00:57.940> taken<00:00:58.120> them<00:00:58.420> and<00:00:58.719> that's<00:00:59.079> just<00:00:59.289> the

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
you've taken them and that's just the

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:01.319 
you've taken them and that's just the
first<00:00:59.409> thing<00:00:59.859> that<00:01:00.010> light<00:01:00.159> field<00:01:00.429> cameras<00:01:01.089> do

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
first thing that light field cameras do

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.469 
first thing that light field cameras do
but<00:01:01.929> even<00:01:02.260> that<00:01:02.440> in<00:01:02.620> itself<00:01:02.920> is<00:01:03.159> pretty

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:03.479 
but even that in itself is pretty

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:05.490 
but even that in itself is pretty
different<00:01:04.479> than<00:01:04.750> what<00:01:04.899> normal<00:01:05.170> counters<00:01:05.379> have

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
different than what normal counters have

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.889 
different than what normal counters have
done<00:01:05.619> in<00:01:05.770> the<00:01:05.860> past<00:01:05.979> a<00:01:06.420> typical<00:01:07.420> digital

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:07.899 
done in the past a typical digital

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:10.170 
done in the past a typical digital
camera<00:01:08.170> captures<00:01:08.619> one<00:01:09.100> image<00:01:09.430> isn't<00:01:09.850> what

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
camera captures one image isn't what

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.359 
camera captures one image isn't what
you're<00:01:10.329> doing<00:01:10.600> in<00:01:10.810> a<00:01:11.409> sense<00:01:11.619> capturing<00:01:12.189> a

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
you're doing in a sense capturing a

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:14.459 
you're doing in a sense capturing a
thousand<00:01:13.030> different<00:01:13.119> images<00:01:13.600> with<00:01:14.320> each

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:14.469 
thousand different images with each

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:16.380 
thousand different images with each
image<00:01:14.649> it's<00:01:15.009> it's<00:01:15.729> really<00:01:16.090> that<00:01:16.240> we're

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
image it's it's really that we're

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.200 
image it's it's really that we're
capturing<00:01:16.630> now<00:01:17.219> multi-dimensional<00:01:18.219> data<00:01:18.460> so

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
capturing now multi-dimensional data so

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.039 
capturing now multi-dimensional data so
instead<00:01:19.509> of<00:01:19.630> capturing<00:01:19.810> this

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
instead of capturing this

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:22.889 
instead of capturing this
two-dimensional<00:01:21.210> moment<00:01:22.210> frozen<00:01:22.420> in<00:01:22.689> time

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
two-dimensional moment frozen in time

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:25.620 
two-dimensional moment frozen in time
which<00:01:23.289> is<00:01:23.439> which<00:01:24.250> is<00:01:24.450> how<00:01:25.450> we've<00:01:25.600> been

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
which is which is how we've been

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.539 
which is which is how we've been
capturing<00:01:26.049> memories<00:01:26.200> so<00:01:26.770> far<00:01:27.009> we're

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
capturing memories so far we're

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:30.090 
capturing memories so far we're
capturing<00:01:27.960> multi-dimensional<00:01:28.960> data<00:01:29.439> now

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
capturing multi-dimensional data now

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.609 
capturing multi-dimensional data now
that<00:01:30.280> data<00:01:30.520> has<00:01:30.789> to<00:01:30.820> be<00:01:31.000> then<00:01:31.600> processed<00:01:32.350> into

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
that data has to be then processed into

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:34.889 
that data has to be then processed into
a<00:01:32.770> picture<00:01:33.219> and<00:01:34.180> in<00:01:34.270> some<00:01:34.420> ways<00:01:34.539> normal

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
a picture and in some ways normal

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:36.569 
a picture and in some ways normal
cameras<00:01:35.170> do<00:01:35.259> this<00:01:35.409> now<00:01:35.560> but<00:01:35.829> this<00:01:36.280> is<00:01:36.430> much

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:36.579 
cameras do this now but this is much

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:38.279 
cameras do this now but this is much
more<00:01:36.659> computationally<00:01:37.659> intensive<00:01:38.049> and<00:01:38.229> in

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
more computationally intensive and in

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:40.440 
more computationally intensive and in
fact<00:01:38.439> puts<00:01:38.770> all<00:01:39.250> of<00:01:39.310> this<00:01:39.670> picture<00:01:39.939> taking<00:01:40.270> in

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
fact puts all of this picture taking in

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.870 
fact puts all of this picture taking in
this<00:01:41.350> computation<00:01:41.890> no<00:01:42.009> ties<00:01:42.250> it<00:01:42.430> to<00:01:42.520> computers

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
this computation no ties it to computers

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.240 
this computation no ties it to computers
basically<00:01:43.149> you<00:01:43.659> still<00:01:43.960> get<00:01:44.259> pictures<00:01:44.979> out<00:01:45.130> of

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
basically you still get pictures out of

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.590 
basically you still get pictures out of
it<00:01:45.369> which<00:01:45.520> are<00:01:45.700> interactive<00:01:46.359> and

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
it which are interactive and

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.480 
it which are interactive and
multi-dimensional<00:01:47.020> and<00:01:47.710> that<00:01:48.189> means<00:01:48.369> that

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
multi-dimensional and that means that

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.090 
multi-dimensional and that means that
you<00:01:48.579> can<00:01:48.700> actually<00:01:48.820> view<00:01:49.119> them<00:01:49.299> in<00:01:49.329> 3d<00:01:49.719> as<00:01:49.840> well

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
you can actually view them in 3d as well

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.830 
you can actually view them in 3d as well
and<00:01:51.100> so<00:01:51.280> what<00:01:51.850> you<00:01:52.090> really<00:01:52.240> get<00:01:52.450> out<00:01:52.539> of<00:01:52.659> it<00:01:52.750> is

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
and so what you really get out of it is

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.980 
and so what you really get out of it is
this<00:01:52.960> unlocked<00:01:54.329> unlocked<00:01:55.329> moment<00:01:55.780> you<00:01:55.869> know

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
this unlocked unlocked moment you know

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.630 
this unlocked unlocked moment you know
you<00:01:56.049> can<00:01:56.380> now<00:01:56.560> interact<00:01:56.859> with<00:01:57.189> this<00:01:57.310> moment

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
you can now interact with this moment

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.980 
you can now interact with this moment
that<00:01:57.729> you've<00:01:57.850> captured<00:01:58.060> much<00:01:58.390> more<00:01:58.600> as<00:01:58.929> a

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
that you've captured much more as a

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.120 
that you've captured much more as a
photographer<00:01:59.170> yourself<00:01:59.770> how<00:01:59.890> does<00:02:00.039> this

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
photographer yourself how does this

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.429 
photographer yourself how does this
affect<00:02:00.280> the<00:02:01.090> way<00:02:01.210> you<00:02:01.240> approach<00:02:01.659> shooting

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
affect the way you approach shooting

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:05.110 
affect the way you approach shooting
photos<00:02:03.090> for<00:02:04.090> yourself

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
photos for yourself

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.330 
photos for yourself
yeah<00:02:05.750> so<00:02:05.930> this<00:02:06.050> this<00:02:06.350> is<00:02:06.500> a<00:02:06.530> new<00:02:06.800> form<00:02:07.250> of

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
yeah so this this is a new form of

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.120 
yeah so this this is a new form of
photography<00:02:07.850> and<00:02:08.410> again<00:02:09.410> it's<00:02:09.770> really<00:02:10.010> the

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
photography and again it's really the

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.250 
photography and again it's really the
first<00:02:10.400> big<00:02:10.850> transformation<00:02:11.570> in<00:02:11.750> photography

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
first big transformation in photography

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.760 
first big transformation in photography
and<00:02:12.550> and<00:02:13.550> it's<00:02:13.760> been<00:02:14.290> very<00:02:15.290> rewarding

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
and and it's been very rewarding

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.820 
and and it's been very rewarding
rewarding<00:02:16.610> to<00:02:16.730> learn<00:02:16.880> about<00:02:17.000> light<00:02:17.480> field

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
rewarding to learn about light field

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.050 
rewarding to learn about light field
because<00:02:18.830> it<00:02:18.980> changes<00:02:19.310> the<00:02:19.610> way<00:02:19.700> that<00:02:19.730> I<00:02:19.880> think

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
because it changes the way that I think

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.280 
because it changes the way that I think
about<00:02:20.240> storytelling<00:02:20.540> you<00:02:21.200> know

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
about storytelling you know

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.260 
about storytelling you know
photographers<00:02:21.800> are<00:02:22.040> really<00:02:22.400> just<00:02:22.910> telling

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
photographers are really just telling

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.760 
photographers are really just telling
stories<00:02:23.720> the<00:02:23.960> most<00:02:24.140> you<00:02:24.350> know<00:02:24.440> either<00:02:24.590> about

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
stories the most you know either about

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.140 
stories the most you know either about
their<00:02:24.950> lives<00:02:25.100> or<00:02:25.400> other<00:02:25.550> things<00:02:25.790> around<00:02:26.000> them

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
their lives or other things around them

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.320 
their lives or other things around them
and<00:02:26.300> to<00:02:26.960> have<00:02:27.140> more<00:02:27.740> dimensions<00:02:28.370> to<00:02:28.880> work<00:02:29.090> with

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
and to have more dimensions to work with

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.900 
and to have more dimensions to work with
is<00:02:29.600> a<00:02:30.530> powerful<00:02:30.890> thing<00:02:31.040> for<00:02:31.490> storytelling

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
is a powerful thing for storytelling

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.850 
is a powerful thing for storytelling
it's<00:02:32.120> just<00:02:32.270> like<00:02:32.390> having<00:02:32.570> more<00:02:32.810> tools<00:02:33.080> to<00:02:33.380> tell

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
it's just like having more tools to tell

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.830 
it's just like having more tools to tell
the<00:02:33.950> story<00:02:34.220> and<00:02:34.400> so<00:02:34.520> that's<00:02:34.700> affected<00:02:35.120> me<00:02:35.270> you

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
the story and so that's affected me you

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.090 
the story and so that's affected me you
know<00:02:35.930> as<00:02:36.110> a<00:02:36.170> light-filled<00:02:36.470> photographer<00:02:36.950> but

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
know as a light-filled photographer but

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.620 
know as a light-filled photographer but
it's<00:02:37.250> also<00:02:37.370> changed<00:02:38.270> the<00:02:38.330> way<00:02:38.450> it<00:02:38.510> I<00:02:38.570> think

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
it's also changed the way it I think

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.420 
it's also changed the way it I think
about<00:02:38.960> normal<00:02:39.530> photography<00:02:39.950> and<00:02:40.160> I<00:02:40.220> think

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
about normal photography and I think

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.280 
about normal photography and I think
much<00:02:40.580> more<00:02:40.610> about<00:02:40.850> depth<00:02:41.360> and<00:02:41.660> relationships

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
much more about depth and relationships

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.960 
much more about depth and relationships
in<00:02:42.500> depth<00:02:42.830> even<00:02:43.280> when<00:02:43.400> I'm<00:02:43.490> shooting<00:02:43.700> with<00:02:43.940> a

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
in depth even when I'm shooting with a

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.670 
in depth even when I'm shooting with a
traditional<00:02:44.180> camera<00:02:44.750> but<00:02:45.020> as<00:02:45.170> the

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
traditional camera but as the

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.940 
traditional camera but as the
storyteller<00:02:46.310> i<00:02:46.370> can<00:02:46.730> either<00:02:47.200> freeze<00:02:48.200> the

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
storyteller i can either freeze the

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.740 
storyteller i can either freeze the
focus<00:02:49.310> in<00:02:49.430> a<00:02:49.490> certain<00:02:49.670> place<00:02:49.970> and<00:02:50.270> export<00:02:50.690> it

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
focus in a certain place and export it

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.200 
focus in a certain place and export it
or<00:02:50.930> I<00:02:51.350> can<00:02:51.530> allow<00:02:51.770> the<00:02:52.310> people<00:02:52.580> viewing<00:02:53.030> the

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
or I can allow the people viewing the

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.570 
or I can allow the people viewing the
pictures<00:02:53.330> to<00:02:53.840> interact<00:02:54.410> with<00:02:54.560> these<00:02:55.190> moments

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
pictures to interact with these moments

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.970 
pictures to interact with these moments
that<00:02:55.820> I've<00:02:55.910> captured<00:02:56.090> these<00:02:56.420> living<00:02:56.690> pictures

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
that I've captured these living pictures

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.470 
that I've captured these living pictures
so<00:02:57.980> I<00:02:58.250> can<00:02:58.430> set<00:02:58.580> the<00:02:58.670> default<00:02:58.790> focus<00:02:59.210> but<00:02:59.390> then

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
so I can set the default focus but then

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.520 
so I can set the default focus but then
they<00:02:59.600> can<00:02:59.780> you<00:03:00.170> know<00:03:00.230> there<00:03:00.410> might<00:03:00.470> be

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
they can you know there might be

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:01.480 
they can you know there might be
something<00:03:00.800> in<00:03:00.890> the<00:03:00.980> background<00:03:01.160> that's

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
something in the background that's

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.670 
something in the background that's
obscured<00:03:02.000> and<00:03:02.240> they<00:03:02.630> can<00:03:02.840> click<00:03:03.200> on<00:03:03.290> it<00:03:03.350> to<00:03:03.470> see

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
obscured and they can click on it to see

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.800 
obscured and they can click on it to see
what<00:03:03.830> it<00:03:03.860> is<00:03:03.950> and<00:03:04.280> that<00:03:04.700> can<00:03:05.060> tell<00:03:05.270> a<00:03:05.300> story<00:03:05.540> you

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
what it is and that can tell a story you

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.590 
what it is and that can tell a story you
know<00:03:05.900> that<00:03:06.170> relationship<00:03:06.860> which<00:03:07.580> takes<00:03:07.880> user

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
know that relationship which takes user

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.930 
know that relationship which takes user
interaction<00:03:09.550> can<00:03:10.550> be<00:03:10.610> a<00:03:10.730> very<00:03:10.850> powerful

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
interaction can be a very powerful

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.320 
interaction can be a very powerful
storytelling<00:03:11.570> tool
