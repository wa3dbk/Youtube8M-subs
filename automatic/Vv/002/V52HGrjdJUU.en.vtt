00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:05.789
 all never welcome a pension fund from total with the best tips for your channel 

00:00:05.789 --> 00:00:10.040
 again with the third questions or the branch I am again interesting 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.259
 ask you the answer 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.350
 starting today with the core of the channel a little runs he asks 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:18.509
 corner you have to respond 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:20.859
 when I scold those responses 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:23.859
 says your videos are bad or just annoying 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.900
 The term with annoying reactions is the most important thing that you have a calm 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:29.710
 remains 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.310
 does not immediately become a carbon credit hedge but I first quietly checked what you were 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:35.240
 going to do 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.170
 you can ask three questions yourself 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.170
 first 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.330
 The reaction is meant to be a baby office rock hard 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.650
 for example, if she is standing 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.660
 sorry but i don't like this video at all 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.740
 then that is an opinion 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.940
 and the viewer can do something like that 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.720
 gates not immediately in the attack often makes it continue 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.440
 what you don't like about video 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.270
 usually you also get handy tips that can crack your videos better 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.340
 you can be a child with an opinion or not 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.990
 Opinions must always be respected 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.960
 the two were first response to live 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.350
 it's fine if someone gives his opinion in March insulting it saved 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.810
 is going 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.050
 way too far 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.680
 in that case 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.250
 remember one thing very well 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.250
 it doesn't 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.020
 Reply 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.410
 gates we want you to respond I get a little angry 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.370
 time then convert 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.450
 so just stay calm 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.500
 click on the arrow next to a cyst guide 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.370
 problem solved 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:42.430
 Thirdly 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.680
 the person writes polluted responses more often 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.130
 if I always give someone a nasty response, video writes 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.550
 then it's time to block 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.720
 it is better that you do not fit the team that function in the reaction 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.700
 the country can be its response only to prevail 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.700
 go travel in congo so page instead 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.380
 click on the arrow under his deed 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.489
 I choose to ignore blocking pubic area 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.889
 then that person cannot write any more brian video at all 

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:16.839
 so don't be fooled by her between defeat is not the knee years earlier 

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:18.280
 do not get mad 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.280
 dont go be pelt wilders 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:23.479
 just keep going 

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:27.979
 blame the reaction and once again the user if you walk more often you can go 

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:30.789
 that is the only correct solution 

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:34.849
 the next question was asked by past and simply past games 

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:36.739
 he asks 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.800
 as you get with each video and off that this just gets 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.129
 and if you find this very directly and 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:44.469
 what can you do best 

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:45.529
 yes bark 

00:02:45.529 --> 00:02:47.750
 it's time that its also just irritating 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.750
 and i actually think joe mcintyre should abolish function 

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:55.189
 People who don't like that can have normal reactions they tell at 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:57.269
 arrival in the video that like it 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.469
 then at least you know how to improve a little more video 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:03.199
 you can't really do much by this time 

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:06.399
 if you have some gemini viewers like you can stand 

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:09.519
 there are always some kind of video that doesn't like it 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.589
 the still not much attention 

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:15.939
 but rather watch the hatch knee get 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:19.069
 if that is the case that you need it immediately 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:21.119
 very much at the time 

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:23.439
 then it may be that he is sitting what the roller shutter 

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:25.529
 I had a following on a previous video 

00:03:25.529 --> 00:03:29.009
 after 17 minutes, this strings master 

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:32.419
 that its really something that person individual doesn't like 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:35.859
 but that is big one day later pittem t spijck pot or something 

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:38.159
 if that happens often 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:42.249
 then you can try coming straight to the fucking event he seems to be in it 

00:03:42.249 --> 00:03:45.439
 district in the video settings 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:50.019
 mostly try to seem extremely straight out of the lead from it is a time 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:54.879
 there you can enable a try the road yet to list this and then write 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.439
 it is probably the enthusiast again 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:01.509
 if you have the very cost of her bag send me that one 

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:04.319
 message on youtube facebook or twitter 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.749
 I would like to help you anyway 

00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:09.689
 routine of think tank willpower 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:12.889
 It is useful to have the website count a YouTube channel 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:14.530
 because it's not sure yet 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.989
 the competition is of course fun to make 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.820
 but with most of the you to mars websites you are no longer concerned 

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:23.069
 landing times videos 

00:04:23.069 --> 00:04:25.729
 nac that can be a short after bullshit 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:27.410
 so if you make the website 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.370
 such a day before reading time things can find something on you tube can't 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.309
 find 

00:04:32.309 --> 00:04:36.379
 you can still get the example of der together or a special one behind the 

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:39.219
 fencing videos poster 

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:42.459
 however, they believe that your websites have no added value 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.259
 Finally received a vacation from Picea and the state of the ginnest builders 

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:52.469
 what materials do you need 

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:57.050
 if your child reads from the playstation I ghost stadium and it costs a bit 

00:04:57.049 --> 00:04:58.389
 a broad market 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:01.939
 the test results you get that I once demanded 

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:05.739
 as we looked at each other exademy or the hdp requires 

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:08.669
 unfortunately such things are hurting hours 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:11.669
 the price is usually between 100 and 200 euros 

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:16.729
 but you do have super bild super sound two recordings 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:21.930
 the cheap solution that doctors can try first explicitly church 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.159
 wants to buy repentance for around twelve 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:29.100
 but if you can simultaneously record and also play on television 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.350
 then you also need putts and no extra cable 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.839
 also, unfortunately, the quality is not as good as the 80b film 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.400
 But for beginners it still may be an option 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:44.779
 i will mention in the description left leg regional products that was mentioned and 

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:48.219
 videos that might help you further, certainly look in the description 

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:50.159
 For more information 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:53.240
 if you yourself also have a chance to win a freek ossel 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.349
 the number 9 in the responses 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:58.550
 what you use for that and what your experiences are with it 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.580
 so can learn from each other 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.029
 also that was very much the question and answer for it this week 

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:08.369
 do you have a good question again troops you write in the responses 

00:06:08.369 --> 00:06:11.399
 then you might get an answer in the next video next week 

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:13.370
 and as always 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.139
 give me clear eyes still video gold that has 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:19.129
 And here again, brand that doesn't do at first 

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:21.960
 this was the kid request the language good luck 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:22.979
 this you can keep
