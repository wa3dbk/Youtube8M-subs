00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.920 
in the proper way I don't think they are
going<00:01:49.560> date<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.850> cops<00:01:51.150> I<00:01:51.420> don't<00:01:51.869> think

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
going date of the cops I don't think

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.200 
going date of the cops I don't think
they're<00:01:52.290> doing<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.680> right<00:01:52.890> thing<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.340> really

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
they're doing the right thing I really

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.480 
they're doing the right thing I really
feel<00:01:54.510> that<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.290> as<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:55.830> want<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.070> show<00:01:56.250> that's

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
feel that and as I want to show that's

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.770 
feel that and as I want to show that's
why<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.640> don't<00:01:56.939> think<00:01:57.150> that<00:01:57.390> they're<00:01:57.630> doing

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
why I don't think that they're doing

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.960 
why I don't think that they're doing
where<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:58.320> think<00:01:58.650> they're<00:01:58.830> hurting<00:01:59.280> least<00:01:59.549> not

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
where I think they're hurting least not

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.770 
where I think they're hurting least not
officially<00:02:00.290> very<00:02:01.290> deeply
