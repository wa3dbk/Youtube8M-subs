that's<00:02:07.080> amazing<00:02:08.080> to<00:02:08.230> me<00:02:09.899> if<00:02:10.899> the<00:02:11.110> spider

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
that's amazing to me if the spider

fortunately<00:02:22.120> what<00:02:22.690> I<00:02:22.720> did<00:02:22.990> here<00:02:23.490> for<00:02:24.490> a<00:02:24.520> safety

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
fortunately what I did here for a safety

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.570 
fortunately what I did here for a safety
measure<00:02:25.440> was<00:02:26.440> that<00:02:26.560> I<00:02:26.620> filled<00:02:26.890> this<00:02:27.070> 10<00:02:27.280> gallon

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
measure was that I filled this 10 gallon

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.640 
measure was that I filled this 10 gallon
aquarium<00:02:27.850> halfway<00:02:28.860> with<00:02:29.860> substrate<00:02:31.650> filling

the 10 gallon aquarium halfway with

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.680 
the 10 gallon aquarium halfway with
substrate<00:02:35.680> will<00:02:36.070> limit<00:02:36.459> the<00:02:36.880> space<00:02:37.180> the

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
substrate will limit the space the

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.650 
substrate will limit the space the
tarantula<00:02:38.260> has<00:02:38.410> if<00:02:38.890> it<00:02:39.730> accidentally<00:02:40.390> falls

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
tarantula has if it accidentally falls

tarantula has if it accidentally falls
from<00:02:40.870> the<00:02:40.930> top<00:02:41.140> of<00:02:41.320> the<00:02:41.410> cage

I<00:02:45.730> originally<00:02:46.730> acquired<00:02:47.360> this<00:02:47.630> innovative

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
I originally acquired this innovative

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.630 
I originally acquired this innovative

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.990 
concept from Rob's II to tarantula guy
1976<00:02:52.640> and<00:02:53.890> basically<00:02:54.890> it<00:02:55.130> requires<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.790> use

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
1976 and basically it requires the use

1976 and basically it requires the use
of<00:02:56.030> two<00:02:56.720> small<00:02:57.170> disposable<00:02:57.680> deli<00:02:58.190> containers

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
one acts as a holder and the other

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.640 
one acts as a holder and the other
container<00:03:04.460> holds<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:04.910> water<00:03:05.320> when<00:03:06.320> the<00:03:06.440> water

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
container holds the water when the water

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.020 
needs to be changed
simply<00:03:08.180> remove<00:03:08.510> the<00:03:08.930> second<00:03:09.320> cup<00:03:09.530> and<00:03:10.030> replace

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.370 
simply remove the second cup and replace
with<00:03:11.270> a<00:03:11.330> new<00:03:11.450> one<00:03:13.360> for<00:03:14.360> some<00:03:14.540> reason<00:03:14.570> these

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
so now I'm going to cover a few

guidelines when it comes to feeding your

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.080 
guidelines when it comes to feeding your
spider<00:04:34.800> tarantulas<00:04:35.800> are<00:04:35.950> very<00:04:36.280> efficient<00:04:36.910> at

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
spider tarantulas are very efficient at

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.380 
spider tarantulas are very efficient at
processing<00:04:37.330> their<00:04:37.870> food<00:04:38.110> and<00:04:39.150> part<00:04:40.150> of<00:04:40.240> this

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
processing their food and part of this

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.690 
processing their food and part of this
comes<00:04:40.450> from<00:04:41.140> the<00:04:41.320> low<00:04:41.440> activity<00:04:42.010> and<00:04:42.220> energy

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
comes from the low activity and energy

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:48.530 
comes from the low activity and energy
these<00:04:43.210> spiders<00:04:43.600> expend<00:04:45.000> so<00:04:46.000> on<00:04:46.150> this<00:04:46.330> note<00:04:46.540> you

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
these spiders expend so on this note you

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.040 
these spiders expend so on this note you
should<00:04:49.540> only<00:04:49.690> feed<00:04:49.990> your<00:04:50.140> spider<00:04:51.510> once<00:04:52.510> a<00:04:52.630> week
