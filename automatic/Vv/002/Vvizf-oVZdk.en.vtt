about fifty percent raw last night or

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.020 
about fifty percent raw last night or
altering<00:00:54.600> yesterday<00:00:55.520> because<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.640> had<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.820> lot

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
altering yesterday because I had a lot

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
that kind of makes up for it but I still

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.149 
that kind of makes up for it but I still
felt<00:01:02.940> pretty<00:01:03.300> crappy<00:01:03.539> after<00:01:04.320> eating<00:01:04.530> that<00:01:04.650> so

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
numbers so much as I'm just trying to be

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.580 
numbers so much as I'm just trying to be
healthy<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:55.850> my<00:01:56.850> original<00:01:57.360> idea<00:01:57.600> was<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.380> I

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
healthy and my original idea was that I

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.520 
healthy and my original idea was that I
was<00:01:58.740> going<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:58.979> eat<00:01:59.130> more<00:01:59.310> normally<00:02:00.409> but<00:02:01.409> then

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
was going to eat more normally but then

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.459 
was going to eat more normally but then
I<00:02:01.619> realized<00:02:02.009> that<00:02:02.219> normal<00:02:02.670> for<00:02:02.939> America<00:02:03.469> is

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
I realized that normal for America is

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.830 
I realized that normal for America is
really<00:02:05.840> really<00:02:06.840> crappy<00:02:08.149> really<00:02:09.149> kind<00:02:09.539> of<00:02:09.629> bad

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
really really crappy really kind of bad

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.710 
really really crappy really kind of bad
food<00:02:10.670> stuff<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:11.879> doesn't<00:02:12.090> make<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.540> feel

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539 
doing this a new raw food thing is that

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:35.360
