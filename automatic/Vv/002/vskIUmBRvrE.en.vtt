the exact same crossover stunt and in a

the exact same crossover stunt and in a

slightly smaller more dramatic looking
package<00:00:12.480> I<00:00:12.780> mean<00:00:12.900> it<00:00:12.990> certainly<00:00:13.230> stands<00:00:13.650> out

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
package I mean it certainly stands out

package I mean it certainly stands out
the<00:00:14.160> top<00:00:14.340> off<00:00:14.519> its<00:00:14.870> coupe<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:16.049> like<00:00:16.260> I<00:00:16.470> mean<00:00:16.590> it's

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
the top off its coupe a like I mean it's

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.769 
the top off its coupe a like I mean it's
a<00:00:16.770> bit<00:00:16.920> reminiscent<00:00:17.220> of<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.850> GTR<00:00:18.270> whereas<00:00:18.660> the

a bit reminiscent of the GTR whereas the

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.400 
a bit reminiscent of the GTR whereas the
bottom<00:00:19.199> bit<00:00:19.410> is<00:00:19.650> pure<00:00:20.189> jacked<00:00:20.699> up<00:00:20.939> hard<00:00:21.539> SUV

bottom bit is pure jacked up hard SUV
but<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.830> best<00:00:23.100> bit<00:00:23.400> is<00:00:23.939> at<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.449> front<00:00:24.779> because

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
but the best bit is at the front because

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.290 
but the best bit is at the front because
it's<00:00:25.380> kind<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.680> like<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.800> cross<00:00:26.070> between<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.699> moon

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
it's kind of like a cross between a moon

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.500 
it's kind of like a cross between a moon

horsepower in the Juke it's good for

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.760 
horsepower in the Juke it's good for
naught<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.150> 60<00:00:48.270> in<00:00:48.600> 8<00:00:49.080> seconds<00:00:49.560> although<00:00:49.680> I

naught to 60 in 8 seconds although I

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.290 
naught to 60 in 8 seconds although I
have<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.040> say<00:00:50.220> does<00:00:50.550> actually<00:00:50.670> feel<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:50.970> little

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
have to say does actually feel a little

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.060 
have to say does actually feel a little
bit<00:00:51.420> quicker<00:00:51.780> than<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.620> unit<00:00:52.860> revs

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
bit quicker than that the unit revs

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.280 
bit quicker than that the unit revs
really<00:00:53.340> smoothly<00:00:53.670> there<00:00:54.450> is<00:00:54.540> a<00:00:54.570> bit<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.780> turbo

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
really smoothly there is a bit of turbo

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.470 
really smoothly there is a bit of turbo
lag<00:00:55.320> down<00:00:55.710> at<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:55.980> bottom<00:00:56.130> I<00:00:56.550> have<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.910> say<00:00:57.150> the

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
lag down at the bottom I have to say the

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.690 
lag down at the bottom I have to say the
noise<00:00:57.720> itself<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.560> it<00:00:58.680> makes<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.160> just<00:00:59.670> a

00:00:59.690 --> 00:00:59.700 
noise itself that it makes is just a

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.310 
noise itself that it makes is just a
little<00:00:59.970> bit<00:01:00.120> whiny<00:01:02.930> as<00:01:03.930> for<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.199> handling

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
little bit whiny as for the handling

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.350 
little bit whiny as for the handling
well<00:01:04.830> there's<00:01:05.430> only<00:01:05.520> body<00:01:05.910> roll<00:01:06.120> through

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
well there's only body roll through

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.610 
well there's only body roll through
corners<00:01:06.690> but<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.900> trade-off<00:01:07.230> of<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.590> a

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:07.620 
corners but the trade-off of that is a

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.140 
corners but the trade-off of that is a
suspension<00:01:08.100> can't<00:01:08.610> they're<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.850> little<00:01:08.940> bit

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
suspension can't they're a little bit

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.630 
suspension can't they're a little bit
firm<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.540> jittery<00:01:09.900> on<00:01:10.050> rough<00:01:10.590> roads<00:01:10.890> from<00:01:11.400> I

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
firm and jittery on rough roads from I

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.100 
firm and jittery on rough roads from I
have<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.180> steering<00:01:12.570> feels<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.810> little<00:01:12.990> bit

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
have is the steering feels a little bit

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.230 
have is the steering feels a little bit
numb<00:01:13.440> and<00:01:13.680> slow<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.640> can<00:01:14.790> sharpen<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.210> up

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
numb and slow and you can sharpen it up

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.240 
numb and slow and you can sharpen it up
by<00:01:15.360> putting<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.690> car<00:01:15.840> into<00:01:16.020> sports<00:01:16.350> mode<00:01:16.650> but

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
by putting the car into sports mode but

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.370 
by putting the car into sports mode but
ultimately<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.510> I<00:01:18.600> think<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.840> Juke<00:01:19.050> is<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.350> a

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
ultimately and I think the Juke is is a

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.850 
ultimately and I think the Juke is is a
much<00:01:19.560> fun<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.950> drive<00:01:20.130> as<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.670> could<00:01:20.880> have<00:01:20.910> been

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.200 

the<00:01:25.860> Jukes<00:01:26.100> cabin<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.640> little<00:01:26.940> bit<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.150> a

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
the Jukes cabin is a little bit of a

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.790 
the Jukes cabin is a little bit of a
mixed<00:01:27.479> bag<00:01:27.510> the<00:01:27.990> driving<00:01:28.320> position<00:01:28.410> feels

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
mixed bag the driving position feels

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.950 
mixed bag the driving position feels
very<00:01:29.040> sporty<00:01:29.550> and<00:01:29.580> the<00:01:29.729> high<00:01:29.940> gear<00:01:30.210> lever<00:01:30.390> is

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
very sporty and the high gear lever is

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.080 
very sporty and the high gear lever is
nice<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.590> it's<00:01:31.860> very<00:01:31.890> accurate<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.520> use<00:01:32.820> I

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
nice and it's very accurate to use I

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.749 
nice and it's very accurate to use I
like<00:01:33.600> this<00:01:34.200> center<00:01:34.530> console<00:01:34.979> which<00:01:35.310> mimics

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
like this center console which mimics

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.910 
like this center console which mimics
the<00:01:36.150> look<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.660> tank<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.259> motorbike

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
the look of the tank of a motorbike

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.100 
the look of the tank of a motorbike
however<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:39.090> think<00:01:39.270> some<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.570> materials

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
however I think some of the materials

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.290 
however I think some of the materials
using<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.800> cabin<00:01:41.160> are<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.850> little<00:01:42.030> bit

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
using the cabin are a little bit

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.810 
using the cabin are a little bit
low-rent<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:43.679> kind<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.009> clever<00:01:44.190> LCD

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
low-rent and this is kind of clever LCD

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.340 
low-rent and this is kind of clever LCD
system<00:01:45.270> down<00:01:45.509> there<00:01:45.539> which<00:01:45.840> shows<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:46.170> things

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
system down there which shows you things

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.910 
system down there which shows you things
like<00:01:46.850> g-force<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.149> turbo<00:01:48.810> boost<00:01:49.080> and<00:01:49.289> really
