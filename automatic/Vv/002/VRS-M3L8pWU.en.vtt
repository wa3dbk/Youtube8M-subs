lining mine more as a guide than

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.340 
lining mine more as a guide than
anything<00:05:59.260> else<00:05:59.500> because<00:06:00.990> it's<00:06:01.990> a<00:06:02.050> really

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:02.350 
anything else because it's a really

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:05.040 
anything else because it's a really
opaque<00:06:03.000> matte<00:06:04.000> lipstick<00:06:04.450> so<00:06:04.480> it's<00:06:04.660> not<00:06:04.750> like<00:06:04.930> I

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.050 
opaque matte lipstick so it's not like I

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.410 
opaque matte lipstick so it's not like I
need<00:06:05.170> another<00:06:05.380> layer<00:06:05.650> for<00:06:05.800> it<00:06:06.010> to<00:06:06.130> grip<00:06:06.310> to<00:06:06.520> but

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:07.420 
need another layer for it to grip to but

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:08.730 
need another layer for it to grip to but
once<00:06:07.600> you<00:06:07.720> start<00:06:07.870> putting<00:06:07.960> on<00:06:08.230> a<00:06:08.260> bright<00:06:08.470> color

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740 
once you start putting on a bright color

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.440 
once you start putting on a bright color
it's<00:06:08.950> really<00:06:09.130> hard<00:06:09.340> to<00:06:09.490> see<00:06:09.730> where<00:06:10.330> your

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:10.450 
it's really hard to see where your

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.570 
it's really hard to see where your
natural<00:06:10.870> lip<00:06:11.020> line<00:06:11.050> is<00:06:11.410> so<00:06:11.680> that's<00:06:11.950> just<00:06:12.250> it's

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
natural lip line is so that's just it's

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:21.249 
natural lip line is so that's just it's
just<00:06:12.670> a<00:06:12.850> guide<00:06:13.030> really

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:21.259 

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:23.629
