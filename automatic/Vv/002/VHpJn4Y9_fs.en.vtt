00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.990
 hello today we will see the interest 

00:00:04.979 --> 00:00:09.959
 in a garden to make his own 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.430
 compost and more particularly we are going 

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:13.379
 see how to build so law 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.199
 compost from do not be at the acronym 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:20.370
 and then you see that this location 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.470
 already at the base we did it flat we had 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.240
 already good quality land we have 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.850
 deployed a little flat and his seven years 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.780
 during the q2 we serve to make 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.780
 our fountain pen 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.420
 we will gather some pallets its 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.100
 bart levers already measure them and 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.129
 the hÃ©rault size and form 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.510
 necessary to make our silo it's 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.760
 a silo that we will do with two 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.589
 compartments a compartment for the 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.600
 made compost is a compartment for 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:49.050
 compost being made the first 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.940
 step 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.089
 it's going to be putting the first pallet 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.589
 level and once they have been fixed 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:58.409
 two levels goes then we will do 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:01.229
 as we presented on the sketch before 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:03.000
 and has the different separation and 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:06.570
 then the rest and well it 'll be a little 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.210
 little like a building game we're going 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.280
 have fun making wooden pieces the 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.979
 good size to be able on the one hand to 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.799
 grow a little bit except side here and then 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:23.909
 after doing our vertical separation 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:25.710
 so go into attack then for 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.810
 connect but pallet ie 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.060
 bring this out is here for 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.700
 can life is the far that I cut 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.840
 the pupils the towns that exceeds 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.540
 behind because I do not have the thickness 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.290
 and then I'm going to amps here is 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:45.240
 screwed up to get a single piece that 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:48.479
 hold on well so so then go on we 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.780
 so will assemble both palettes 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:55.909
 that we cut the I use stainless misses 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.909
 parquet exceptional life 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:05.490
 started putting our first edges 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:07.619
 for the west to do both 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.479
 next parish of the silo we go all 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.709
 simply take a palette that we are going 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.670
 cut in two so that's the pay 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.890
 which are very practical 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.989
 because if you wanted behind the 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.040
 pallet them separate we can cut at 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.040
 middle so what are we going to do 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:36.190
 that's my second amount then in fact 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.440
 on the basic pallets like that the 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.290
 spacing a bit wide so the earth 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.640
 risk of passing the leaves too so 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.040
 I recovered from other boards of 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.959
 pallets and then actually interspersed 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.700
 and so I do like myself I did to 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.310
 this place so for this be 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.970
 relatively well closed last small 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:58.150
 thing we're going to put between the edges and 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.920
 outside implication everything will serve to 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.780
 tankers to prevent it from moving away 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.350
 when we are going to put a little weight here 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.840
 a way to make a little law 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.600
 compost for cheap since pallets 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.709
 most expensive recovery limit 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.190
 it's the stainless steel screws 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:17.410
 so that 's compost 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.989
 so it's a light earth that 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.060
 is very mixed with fiber 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.970
 plant of course and then you can 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.820
 find in quality compost 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:31.060
 be compost style greens 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:33.880
 earthworms either this type of larvae which is 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.020
 larvae golden rose chafer which is a 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.670
 larva who 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:41.720
 is extremely important to compost 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.040
 since it will improve the 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.460
 quality by working in your 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.170
 compost 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.170
 so here you do not kill them
