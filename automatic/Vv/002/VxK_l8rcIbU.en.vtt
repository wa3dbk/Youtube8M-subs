for the traffic control so you're gonna
be<00:02:35.060> able<00:02:35.180> to<00:02:35.330> give<00:02:35.450> you<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.660> traffic<00:02:36.099> then<00:02:37.099> we

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
be able to give you the traffic then we

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.890 
be able to give you the traffic then we
also<00:02:37.340> have<00:02:37.610> the<00:02:37.730> harness<00:02:38.090> here<00:02:38.239> which<00:02:38.540> has<00:02:38.720> all

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
also have the harness here which has all

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.530 
also have the harness here which has all
your<00:02:39.019> video<00:02:39.290> inputs<00:02:39.910> audio<00:02:40.910> inputs<00:02:41.300> this<00:02:41.480> is

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
your video inputs audio inputs this is

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.610 
your video inputs audio inputs this is
audio<00:02:41.989> rear<00:02:42.230> audio<00:02:42.890> front<00:02:43.340> video<00:02:44.060> input<00:02:44.620> you

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
audio rear audio front video input you

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.000 
audio rear audio front video input you
got<00:02:45.860> weird<00:02:46.549> monitor<00:02:47.269> output<00:02:47.780> I<00:02:48.110> guess<00:02:48.799> for<00:02:48.950> the

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
got weird monitor output I guess for the

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.240 
got weird monitor output I guess for the
audio<00:02:49.870> you<00:02:50.870> have<00:02:50.900> auxilary<00:02:51.650> input<00:02:51.769> it's

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
audio you have auxilary input it's

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.610 
audio you have auxilary input it's
through<00:02:52.430> RCA<00:02:52.940> instead<00:02:53.510> up<00:02:53.599> through<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:53.930> aux

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
through RCA instead up through the aux

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.080 
through RCA instead up through the aux
cable<00:02:55.150> camera<00:02:56.150> and<00:02:56.750> me<00:02:57.430> that's<00:02:58.430> not<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:58.819> one

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
cable camera and me that's not the one

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.839 
cable camera and me that's not the one
video<00:02:59.390> harness<00:02:59.660> then<00:02:59.810> it<00:02:59.900> comes<00:03:00.049> with

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
video harness then it comes with

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:04.229 
video harness then it comes with
microphone<00:03:01.849> as<00:03:02.060> well<00:03:02.120> for<00:03:02.660> the<00:03:02.750> Bluetooth

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
microphone as well for the Bluetooth

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.300 
microphone as well for the Bluetooth
that<00:03:05.239> the<00:03:05.420> GPS<00:03:05.780> antenna<00:03:05.900> which<00:03:06.860> is<00:03:07.040> really

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
that the GPS antenna which is really

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.610 
that the GPS antenna which is really
small<00:03:07.549> sleek<00:03:07.970> and<00:03:08.180> it<00:03:08.870> can<00:03:09.019> be<00:03:09.140> hidden<00:03:09.290> very

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
small sleek and it can be hidden very

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.420 
small sleek and it can be hidden very
easily<00:03:09.819> your<00:03:10.819> power<00:03:11.030> harness<00:03:11.480> has<00:03:11.989> the<00:03:12.430> bypass

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
easily your power harness has the bypass

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.039 
easily your power harness has the bypass
break<00:03:13.790> which<00:03:14.000> will<00:03:14.510> figure<00:03:14.690> out<00:03:14.840> how<00:03:14.989> to

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
break which will figure out how to

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:16.750 
break which will figure out how to
bypass<00:03:15.290> this<00:03:15.620> minute<00:03:15.980> soon<00:03:16.160> enough<00:03:16.400> as<00:03:16.579> well

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
bypass this minute soon enough as well

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.180 
bypass this minute soon enough as well
and<00:03:17.299> then<00:03:17.690> I<00:03:17.720> guess<00:03:18.019> that<00:03:18.230> other<00:03:18.379> big<00:03:18.680> port<00:03:18.980> was

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
and then I guess that other big port was

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:29.199 
and then I guess that other big port was
for<00:03:19.430> this<00:03:19.579> iPod<00:03:20.000> cable<00:03:27.310> connection<00:03:28.310> here<00:03:28.579> and

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
for this iPod cable connection here and

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.580 
for this iPod cable connection here and
I<00:03:29.329> believe<00:03:29.629> it's<00:03:29.750> just<00:03:29.840> gonna<00:03:29.989> give<00:03:30.260> you<00:03:30.290> the

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
I believe it's just gonna give you the

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.809 
I believe it's just gonna give you the
USB<00:03:31.099> and<00:03:31.280> the<00:03:31.370> aux<00:03:31.579> cable<00:03:33.250> that's<00:03:34.250> one<00:03:34.519> two

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
USB and the aux cable that's one two

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:37.750 
USB and the aux cable that's one two
three<00:03:35.319> four<00:03:36.319> five<00:03:36.620> six<00:03:37.010> components<00:03:37.579> that<00:03:37.639> it

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
three four five six components that it

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.640 
three four five six components that it
comes<00:03:37.940> in<00:03:38.090> with<00:03:38.269> as<00:03:38.840> well<00:03:39.109> it's<00:03:39.290> gonna<00:03:39.410> give

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
comes in with as well it's gonna give

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.920 
comes in with as well it's gonna give
you<00:03:39.769> the<00:03:40.010> manual<00:03:40.430> and<00:03:40.940> the<00:03:41.510> quick<00:03:41.750> reference

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
you the manual and the quick reference

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.770 
you the manual and the quick reference
guide<00:03:42.350> handle<00:03:44.709> boxes<00:03:46.180> and<00:03:47.180> see<00:03:47.359> what<00:03:47.510> kind<00:03:47.720> of

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
guide handle boxes and see what kind of

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.360 
guide handle boxes and see what kind of
things<00:03:48.049> so<00:03:48.500> it<00:03:48.560> has<00:03:48.680> multiple<00:03:49.040> color

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
things so it has multiple color

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.520 
things so it has multiple color
illumination<00:03:50.120> as<00:03:50.269> well<00:03:50.510> to<00:03:51.200> see<00:03:51.380> blue<00:03:51.620> here

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
illumination as well to see blue here

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.129 
illumination as well to see blue here
the<00:03:54.530> front<00:03:54.709> of<00:03:54.829> the<00:03:54.920> box<00:03:55.160> you're<00:03:55.340> gonna<00:03:55.459> see

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:56.139 
the front of the box you're gonna see

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:59.979 
the front of the box you're gonna see
that<00:03:57.139> it's<00:03:57.349> red<00:03:57.650> so<00:03:58.430> it<00:03:58.489> does<00:03:58.669> do<00:03:58.849> red<00:03:59.150> blue

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
that it's red so it does do red blue

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.470 
that it's red so it does do red blue
here's<00:04:00.560> white<00:04:00.859> and<00:04:01.280> it<00:04:01.910> looks<00:04:02.090> like<00:04:02.209> it<00:04:02.329> has
