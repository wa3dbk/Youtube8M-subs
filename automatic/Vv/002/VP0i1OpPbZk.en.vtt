glossopharyngeal your vagus nerve and

glossopharyngeal your vagus nerve and
then<00:05:29.220> your<00:05:29.400> accessory<00:05:29.909> nerve<00:05:30.090> here<00:05:30.360> and<00:05:30.930> up

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
then your accessory nerve here and up

then your accessory nerve here and up
front<00:05:31.560> you<00:05:31.680> have<00:05:31.800> your<00:05:31.830> hypoglossal<00:05:32.340> nerves

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:32.909 
front you have your hypoglossal nerves

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:35.510 
front you have your hypoglossal nerves
those<00:05:33.870> are<00:05:33.990> the<00:05:34.050> 12<00:05:34.289> nerves<00:05:34.500> cranial<00:05:35.280> brain
