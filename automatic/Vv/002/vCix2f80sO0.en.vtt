probably<00:01:19.060> because<00:01:19.359> of<00:01:19.600> the<00:01:19.719> parts<00:01:20.170> they're

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
probably because of the parts they're

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.679 
probably because of the parts they're
probably<00:01:20.799> pretty<00:01:21.490> difficult<00:01:21.759> to<00:01:22.149> put<00:01:22.359> them<00:01:22.539> in

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689

i<00:01:22.960> mean<00:01:23.679> i<00:01:23.710> have<00:01:23.889> a<00:01:24.189> few<00:01:24.520> problems<00:01:24.759> where<00:01:25.270> i<00:01:25.299> put

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
i mean i have a few problems where i put

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.649 
i mean i have a few problems where i put
like<00:01:26.289> the<00:01:26.319> armor<00:01:26.889> inside<00:01:27.549> like<00:01:28.030> in<00:01:28.270> the<00:01:28.359> joint

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.499 
like the armor inside like in the joint
areas<00:01:29.079> so<00:01:29.859> it<00:01:30.039> could<00:01:30.280> be<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:30.490> reason<00:01:30.670> why<00:01:30.999> they

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
areas so it could be the reason why they

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:33.779 
areas so it could be the reason why they
could<00:01:31.929> have<00:01:32.109> discontinued<00:01:33.039> or<00:01:33.219> because<00:01:33.759> of
