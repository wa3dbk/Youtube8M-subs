tools well I'm about to show you exactly
what<00:00:20.670> that<00:00:20.850> can<00:00:21.029> look<00:00:21.150> like<00:00:21.210> let's<00:00:21.840> have<00:00:21.990> a

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
what that can look like let's have a

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.710 
what that can look like let's have a
look<00:00:22.230> now<00:00:22.730> as<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:24.029> may<00:00:24.150> have<00:00:24.240> noticed<00:00:24.570> in<00:00:24.689> the

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
look now as you may have noticed in the

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.349 
look now as you may have noticed in the
intro<00:00:25.170> we<00:00:25.590> have<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.740> problem<00:00:26.279> already<00:00:26.460> in

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
intro we have a problem already in

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.779 
intro we have a problem already in
addition<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.930> trim<00:00:28.170> being<00:00:28.470> removed<00:00:29.189> you

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
addition to the trim being removed you

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.279 
addition to the trim being removed you
can<00:00:29.820> see<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.420> they<00:00:30.750> just<00:00:30.779> completely

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
can see that they just completely

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.170 
can see that they just completely
splintered<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.099> door<00:00:32.279> jamb<00:00:32.579> they're<00:00:32.880> just

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
splintered the door jamb they're just

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.540 
splintered the door jamb they're just
tore<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.719> deadbolt<00:00:34.110> right<00:00:34.770> out<00:00:35.010> splintered

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
tore the deadbolt right out splintered

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.060 
tore the deadbolt right out splintered
that<00:00:35.760> wood<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.329> all<00:00:37.200> right<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.680> here<00:00:37.890> this

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
that wood and all right and here this

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.750 
that wood and all right and here this
poor<00:00:38.460> thing<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:39.559> as<00:00:40.559> near<00:00:41.100> as<00:00:41.129> I<00:00:41.340> can<00:00:41.399> tell

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
poor thing is as near as I can tell

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.790 
poor thing is as near as I can tell
right<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:42.030> am<00:00:42.390> by<00:00:42.660> no<00:00:42.719> means<00:00:42.840> an<00:00:43.140> expert<00:00:43.260> it

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
right I am by no means an expert it

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.010 
right I am by no means an expert it
looks<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.280> me<00:00:44.399> like<00:00:44.430> they<00:00:45.000> probably<00:00:45.390> had<00:00:45.989> just

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
looks to me like they probably had just

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.900 
looks to me like they probably had just
a<00:00:46.530> simple<00:00:47.010> pry<00:00:47.789> bar<00:00:48.059> with<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.870> lot<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.140> time<00:00:49.530> and

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
a simple pry bar with a lot of time and

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.450 
a simple pry bar with a lot of time and
perhaps<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:51.600> superhuman<00:00:52.320> strength<00:00:52.770> here

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
perhaps is superhuman strength here

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.420 
perhaps is superhuman strength here
there's<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.480> lot<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.930> force<00:00:55.199> as<00:00:55.410> you'll<00:00:55.590> see<00:00:55.860> but

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
there's a lot of force as you'll see but

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.760 
there's a lot of force as you'll see but
my<00:00:56.550> guess<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:57.120> with<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.750> goofy<00:00:58.079> pry<00:00:58.320> bar<00:00:58.590> they

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
my guess is with that goofy pry bar they

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.060 
my guess is with that goofy pry bar they
tried<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.219> just<00:00:59.430> lever<00:01:00.140> the<00:01:01.140> dial<00:01:01.500> right<00:01:01.829> off

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
tried to just lever the dial right off

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.399 
tried to just lever the dial right off
and<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.789> can<00:01:02.940> see<00:01:02.969> that's<00:01:03.449> been<00:01:03.750> pretty<00:01:04.110> badly

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
and you can see that's been pretty badly

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.340 
and you can see that's been pretty badly
damaged<00:01:05.100> there<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.760> handle<00:01:06.210> ironically<00:01:07.049> is

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
damaged there the handle ironically is

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.359 
damaged there the handle ironically is
in<00:01:08.220> state<00:01:09.060> mainly<00:01:09.330> intact<00:01:09.750> shape<00:01:10.110> again<00:01:11.100> tool

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
in state mainly intact shape again tool

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.990 
in state mainly intact shape again tool
marks<00:01:12.110> right<00:01:13.110> along<00:01:13.380> here<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.700> think<00:01:14.820> a

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
marks right along here and I think a

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.090 
marks right along here and I think a
little<00:01:15.119> bit<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.420> bowing<00:01:15.900> where<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.770> looks<00:01:16.979> like

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
little bit of bowing where it looks like

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.109 
little bit of bowing where it looks like
they<00:01:17.280> tried<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.659> lever<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:19.229> but<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.520> crux<00:01:20.939> of

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
they tried to lever that but the crux of

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.330 
they tried to lever that but the crux of
the<00:01:21.180> matter<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.900> all<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:23.909> here<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.340> I

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
the matter is all of this here and I

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.300 
the matter is all of this here and I
will<00:01:26.909> pull<00:01:27.330> this<00:01:27.869> panel<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.740> can<00:01:28.890> actually

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
will pull this panel so you can actually

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.200 
will pull this panel so you can actually
see<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.329> full<00:01:30.570> extent<00:01:31.170> here<00:01:31.880> so<00:01:32.880> stepping

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
see the full extent here so stepping

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.690 
see the full extent here so stepping
back<00:01:33.509> for<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.780> moment<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.430> giving<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.549> the

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
back for a moment and giving you the

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.210 
back for a moment and giving you the
overall<00:01:36.119> picture<00:01:36.420> here<00:01:37.049> I'm<00:01:37.619> no<00:01:37.979> safe

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
overall picture here I'm no safe

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.420 
overall picture here I'm no safe
engineer<00:01:38.670> but<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:38.939> looks<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.360> me<00:01:39.390> like<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.560> big

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
engineer but it looks to me like the big

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.910 
engineer but it looks to me like the big
piece<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.880> hanging<00:01:42.270> off<00:01:42.450> as<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:43.590> Mythbusters

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
piece is hanging off as the Mythbusters

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.560 
piece is hanging off as the Mythbusters
would<00:01:44.280> say<00:01:44.460> well<00:01:44.640> there's<00:01:44.850> your<00:01:45.030> problem

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
would say well there's your problem

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.639 
would say well there's your problem
and<00:01:46.460> that<00:01:47.460> really<00:01:47.640> is<00:01:47.790> exactly<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:49.049> issue<00:01:49.079> you

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
and that really is exactly the issue you

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.429 
and that really is exactly the issue you
can<00:01:49.799> see<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:50.640> bar<00:01:51.060> was<00:01:51.689> simply<00:01:52.170> tack

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
can see that that bar was simply tack

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.380 
can see that that bar was simply tack
welded<00:01:52.979> there<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.729> I'll<00:01:53.820> show<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.119> in

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
welded there and I'll show you that in

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.770 
welded there and I'll show you that in
detail<00:01:55.130> tack<00:01:56.130> welded<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:56.939> backside<00:01:57.479> of

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
detail tack welded to the backside of

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.020 
detail tack welded to the backside of
the<00:01:58.469> door<00:01:58.979> plate<00:01:59.399> there

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
the door plate there

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.840 
the door plate there
the<00:02:01.540> these<00:02:02.020> bad<00:02:02.290> guys<00:02:02.500> just<00:02:03.130> simply<00:02:03.610> broke

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
the these bad guys just simply broke

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.340 
the these bad guys just simply broke
those<00:02:04.119> little<00:02:04.360> tack<00:02:04.540> welds<00:02:04.960> with<00:02:05.110> enough

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
those little tack welds with enough

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.400 
those little tack welds with enough
force<00:02:05.619> you<00:02:06.220> can<00:02:06.340> see<00:02:06.549> broke<00:02:06.850> it<00:02:07.200> 3/4<00:02:08.200> of<00:02:08.229> the

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
force you can see broke it 3/4 of the

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.490 
force you can see broke it 3/4 of the
way<00:02:08.530> around<00:02:08.560> and<00:02:09.250> that<00:02:10.179> let<00:02:10.660> them<00:02:10.869> right<00:02:11.290> in

basically four little small spot welds

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.250 
basically four little small spot welds
there<00:02:33.280> along<00:02:33.820> that<00:02:34.209> entire<00:02:34.330> top<00:02:34.900> edge<00:02:35.080> of<00:02:35.200> the

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.070 
there along that entire top edge of the
door<00:02:35.709> is<00:02:36.040> kind<00:02:36.340> of<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.519> extent<00:02:37.090> and<00:02:37.300> same

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
door is kind of the extent and same

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.930 
door is kind of the extent and same
thing<00:02:38.470> as<00:02:38.680> we<00:02:39.160> go<00:02:39.340> down<00:02:39.610> it's<00:02:39.910> just

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
thing as we go down it's just

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.800 
thing as we go down it's just
periodically<00:02:40.870> tacked<00:02:41.739> in<00:02:42.070> place<00:02:42.450> so<00:02:43.450> maybe

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
periodically tacked in place so maybe

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.330 
periodically tacked in place so maybe
good<00:02:44.019> for<00:02:44.050> your<00:02:44.350> casual<00:02:45.150> burglar<00:02:46.150> but
