 today we are here to unbox in a 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:21.560
 terminal of which we have already heard 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:24.320
 talk long enough either to 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.890
 positive and negative aspects and today there is 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.319
 we have it here to take it for later 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.899

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:43.100
 fish cart outside 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.690
 huawei ascend of seven wei jian you need 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:50.320
 in the terminal is very pretty we have 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.320
 immediately remove the plastiki we put 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.940
 oh well for now let's leave it like this 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.289
 really very elegant terminal a lot 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.140
 beautiful 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:05.990
 then we'll go ahead to try it a little 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.760
 more intensely see also from ours 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.380
 point of view what we will think of this 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.710
 smartphone you saw on the part 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:16.100
 right we have slots as the says 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:19.750
 plasticine behind sd card sim that 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:23.120
 should be microsim power button 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.280
 extinguish folk rocker up here 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.409
 we have a microphone and the jack for le 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.890
 headphones on the left side 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:36.539
 very clean and below we have another 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.950
 microphone and the micro usb socket for the 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:40.530
 recharge behind we have ours 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.399
 13 megapixel camera with LED flash 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.530
 and the speaker has a lot behind texture 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.579
 beautiful then we teach to remove the plus 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.859
 who bent out now 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.479
 so let's see what it is the 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:53.729
 texture I have to say really a lot 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.719
 beautiful in this operation was ahead 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.729
 we have our audio in capsule and 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:01.079
 8 megapixel camera 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.409
 so it should be a very good one 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.179
 front camera and then we have the various 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.670
 sensors well but let's see what 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:13.500
 it's in the box 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:15.180
 we open immediately find here 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.930
 the acli combs to open the carts 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.930
 of the telephone 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:26.760
 we go to open it and inside we find two 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.910
 NFC chip and various instructions 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:35.190
 inside this we find instead let's go to 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:38.099
 open it quite elegantly as a box 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.889
 but inconvenient to create out there stuff here 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:43.829
 we find headphones that if they are not in 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:45.720
 ear are normal we have headphones 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:47.549
 that of quality does not seem so to me 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.280
 good but then we will actually go to 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:56.250
 see them in use a very beautiful cable 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:03:00.150
 usb micro usb a plastic already removed not 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.209
 we know why from devices then here 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.150
 we find our charger 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:09.750
 charger with two ampere inputs 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.960
 no one ampere charge sorry theory 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.960
 very nice 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.180
 of the huawei well this is a bit that 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.530
 that we find inside the box 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.420
 pack sold on the Italian market 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.500
 so this is the phone that 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.410
 you will buy in Italy what 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.870
 you will find us in the box 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.910
 soon for a full review later 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.830
 have made intensive use of 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.590
 this smartphone and be able to say the 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:37.020
 our considerations well guys hello 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.020
