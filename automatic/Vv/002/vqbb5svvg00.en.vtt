00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.179
 contact colder than you the 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.519
 organize workshops where children and 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.710
 young people between 6 and 18 years old 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.289
 Learn programming code by John 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.900
 founded in 2011 in ireland and kent 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.119
 since then a great success worldwide 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.189
 Martin Temples made it too 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.189
 she got a foothold in Belgium 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.260

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.760

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.320
 arrive in November of last year 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.870

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.690
 elected ishiguro of it last year 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.210
 years and in that role and I really wanted 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.030
 to resources to inspire young people 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.010
 to go to architects and when I got them 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.200
 tell the words about their club then 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.129
 I thought this is it I want to do this 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.809
 for belgium 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.149
 and this is also in the clean air 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.739
 antwerp according to be pilgrims 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.829
 computers are indispensable 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.820
 our daily life in its programmers 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.109
 contemporary wizards 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.550
 they tell the children that the world 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.220
 I actually like in Harry Potter 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.780
 the wizards and the mugs and with something 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.580
 searched work had to write the codes or 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.450
 are the wizards and all the rest are 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.860
 mugs 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.750
 these kids come here to be anyway 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.760
 an app to be the first code part 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.009
 John was already a great success 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.720
 30 children signed up strikingly 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.090
 more boys than girls 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.909
 the step for nine is bigger 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.560
 We know from experience that girls are less 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.340
 self confidence we have the 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.960
 talents 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.180
 it's not because they can't 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.960
 Niggers at least I would go here 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.240
 want to get 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.549
 I played a while with the idea 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.470
 the code to do only for girls or 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.729
 a goal only for girls 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.710
 maybe I'll still do it then 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.899
 but 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.810
 nines have the talents it is our one 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.640
 very difficult at this age 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.770
 just like a football club girls and 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.630
 boys go mixing will each month 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.340
 an encoder dojo takes place 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.240
 the next meeting is planned 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.240
 on March 9
