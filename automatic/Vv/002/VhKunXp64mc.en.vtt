00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
it was just one of those things I

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.810 
it was just one of those things I
figured<00:02:46.560> I'd<00:02:46.650> do<00:02:46.800> before<00:02:47.160> has<00:02:47.310> grown<00:02:47.550> up<00:02:47.670> you

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
figured I'd do before has grown up you

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.020 
figured I'd do before has grown up you
know<00:02:47.940> do<00:02:48.900> taxes<00:02:49.500> feed<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:49.980> dog<00:02:50.160> was<00:02:50.880> the

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
know do taxes feed the dog was the

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.300 
know do taxes feed the dog was the
desert<00:02:51.330> that's<00:02:52.260> besides<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:52.620> point<00:02:52.710> though

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
desert that's besides the point though

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.990 
desert that's besides the point though
you<00:02:55.209> believed<00:02:55.569> in<00:02:55.690> genies<00:02:56.140> in<00:02:56.290> ninth<00:02:56.530> grade

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
you believed in genies in ninth grade

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.300 
you believed in genies in ninth grade
quiet<00:02:58.000> you<00:02:58.980> so<00:02:59.980> I<00:03:00.310> would<00:03:00.730> rub<00:03:00.940> my<00:03:00.970> Genie<00:03:01.390> lamp

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
quiet you so I would rub my Genie lamp

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.280 
quiet you so I would rub my Genie lamp
and<00:03:03.760> yeah<00:03:04.120> there'd<00:03:04.569> be<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:04.870> requisite

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
and yeah there'd be the requisite

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.199 
and yeah there'd be the requisite
exploring<00:03:05.830> of<00:03:05.950> the<00:03:06.040> world<00:03:06.310> and<00:03:06.700> the<00:03:06.790> taunting

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
exploring of the world and the taunting

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.880 
exploring of the world and the taunting
of<00:03:07.270> the<00:03:07.420> enemies<00:03:07.780> but<00:03:08.440> you<00:03:08.500> know<00:03:08.620> most<00:03:08.800> the

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
of the enemies but you know most the

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.360 
of the enemies but you know most the
time<00:03:09.130> I<00:03:09.430> just<00:03:09.760> sit<00:03:10.060> in<00:03:10.800> my<00:03:11.800> mind<00:03:12.130> it<00:03:12.280> was

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
time I just sit in my mind it was

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.100 
time I just sit in my mind it was
impossibly<00:03:12.970> quiet<00:03:13.330> and<00:03:13.540> still<00:03:13.750> up<00:03:13.930> there

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
impossibly quiet and still up there

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.960 
impossibly quiet and still up there
every<00:03:14.349> thought<00:03:15.040> would<00:03:15.250> have<00:03:15.430> an<00:03:15.550> echo<00:03:15.790> and

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
every thought would have an echo and

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.780 
every thought would have an echo and
that<00:03:16.060> kind<00:03:16.300> of<00:03:16.360> silence<00:03:16.780> I<00:03:17.099> haven<00:03:18.099> today<00:03:18.370> I

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
that kind of silence I haven today I

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.160 
that kind of silence I haven today I
find<00:03:19.060> myself<00:03:19.120> painting<00:03:19.780> what<00:03:19.900> it'd<00:03:19.989> probably

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
find myself painting what it'd probably

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:29.080 
find myself painting what it'd probably
be<00:03:20.290> like<00:03:20.560> if<00:03:20.800> it<00:03:20.920> all<00:03:21.040> come<00:03:21.310> true

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.339 

never<00:03:30.090> really<00:03:30.270> thought<00:03:30.540> too<00:03:30.750> far<00:03:30.990> beyond<00:03:31.319> that

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
never really thought too far beyond that

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.910 
never really thought too far beyond that
point<00:03:31.970> we're<00:03:32.970> about<00:03:33.120> physics<00:03:33.750> or<00:03:34.050> causality

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
point we're about physics or causality

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:43.640 
point we're about physics or causality
oh<00:03:35.160> yes<00:03:35.880> very<00:03:36.330> good<00:03:36.660> gold<00:03:37.590> star

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.789 

you<00:03:44.189> know<00:03:44.310> it<00:03:44.819> bothers<00:03:45.239> me<00:03:45.450> now<00:03:46.260> that<00:03:46.290> I've<00:03:46.620> got

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
you know it bothers me now that I've got

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.470 
you know it bothers me now that I've got
what<00:03:46.920> I<00:03:46.950> wanted<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.700> certainty<00:03:48.150> of<00:03:48.180> which

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
what I wanted the certainty of which

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.500 
what I wanted the certainty of which
consumed<00:03:49.049> so<00:03:49.349> much<00:03:49.409> of<00:03:49.620> my<00:03:49.739> childhood<00:03:49.769> I<00:03:50.510> don't

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
consumed so much of my childhood I don't

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.350 
consumed so much of my childhood I don't
know<00:03:51.569> what<00:03:51.720> to<00:03:51.750> do

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:25.990 

here's<00:03:56.360> an<00:03:56.450> idea<00:04:05.920> you<00:04:06.920> know<00:04:07.040> baby<00:04:07.250> birds<00:04:07.640> right

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:05:43.650 

maybe<00:04:26.660> you<00:04:26.780> should<00:04:26.960> start<00:04:27.230> with<00:04:27.380> the<00:04:27.500> shed

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:43.660 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:52.790 

you

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.860
