 from a communications protocol 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:54.720

 it is packed jejejeje gijón el cádiz 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.760
 Each package is limited in size 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.080
 the courier should preside over how to divide the information 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.890
 and how to interpret it every time I need a label 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.680
 describing important information such as the sender's address 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.069

 it also receives a label for the proxy server 

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:31.679
 which has a special function as we will see later 

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:36.269
 at this point the data to leave our machine and exit to the network 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.539
 wired from our corporation 

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:42.099

 I used them to connect to all local computers excel printers 

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:54.009
 and the lan is a nothing controlled place and unfortunately 

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:58.269
 accidents may occur 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.950

 the router the local 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:23.749
 read the addresses and if necessary because the packets that in another network 

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:26.569
 the router 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.949
 symbol of control in a disordered world in peace 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:44.439
 this is the conservative methodical selfless methodical rock 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:49.039
 sometimes not exactly fast but it's acting 

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:51.839
