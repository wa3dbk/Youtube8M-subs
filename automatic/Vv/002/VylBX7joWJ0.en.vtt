this it's it's incredible and that's one
of<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.350> things<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:15.650> guys<00:02:15.740> love<00:02:16.010> about<00:02:16.040> this

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
of the things the guys love about this

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:17.949 
of the things the guys love about this
is<00:02:16.670> you<00:02:16.700> can<00:02:16.910> shape<00:02:17.120> it<00:02:17.150> your<00:02:17.420> foot

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
so well it also uses a really light

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.090 
so well it also uses a really light
high-performance<00:02:21.290> shell<00:02:21.500> it<00:02:21.680> uses<00:02:22.010> of

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
high-performance shell it uses of

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.280 
high-performance shell it uses of
polyether<00:02:22.490> shell<00:02:22.670> which<00:02:23.540> is<00:02:23.690> also<00:02:23.870> shock

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
polyether shell which is also shock

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.190 
polyether shell which is also shock
absorbing<00:02:24.860> and<00:02:25.130> very<00:02:25.760> light<00:02:26.000> and<00:02:26.239> stuff<00:02:26.600> so

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
absorbing and very light and stuff so

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.140 
absorbing and very light and stuff so

everything not only does it have the

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.130 
everything not only does it have the
performance<00:02:32.360> it's<00:02:32.569> got<00:02:32.750> the<00:02:32.930> shock

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
performance it's got the shock

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.050 
performance it's got the shock
absorption<00:02:33.530> but<00:02:34.190> it's<00:02:34.310> light<00:02:34.580> on<00:02:34.610> the<00:02:34.760> foot

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
absorption but it's light on the foot

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.090 
absorption but it's light on the foot
