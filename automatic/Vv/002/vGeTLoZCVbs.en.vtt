00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:09.389
 so also make us a mount for 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.960
 I will show the cameras next such a collective farm 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.960
 here i have 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.470
 the program 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.010
 but 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.310
 from 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:45.390
 then take this 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:48.870
 an aluminum shelf but the length is actually 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:51.690
 We do what we need, that is, the camera 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.900
 very big viewing angle then let's say 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.970
 you can take her closer to the forest 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.130
 Next, take an ordinary motor from me 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.990
 there was an old turnigy little motor 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.530
 sense he was new but nobody his 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:07.050
 applied for a couple of years lying around 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:11.370
 then the collet is also from the motor here 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:14.160
 it is worth not know shorter than any land 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.760
 collected all the right two motors cut take 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.980
 textolite to textolite 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.290
 screws we put the motor and we take double-sided 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.520
 Scotch 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.880
 more powerful actually on diskach take 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:30.180
 to grow lay and we get 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.970
 already full mount we see here 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:37.890
 begins to peel off but the principle on 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:40.640
 one set of races is enough 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:45.610
 now by unstick 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.610
 give power scotch tape soon king 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.330
 so here is the main attachment point 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.459
 it was already here to see the sand where 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.220
 glued because the roof is not quite 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:00.110
 even your own 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.860
 to other cars it's the same to take them off 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.430
 different angles 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.370
 camera with jay why from the same and because 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.620
 it seems to me the easiest 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:12.050
 gopro pity with the same not pathetic at easy 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:15.970
 because the console is quite long 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.970
 it turns out a bit stressful
