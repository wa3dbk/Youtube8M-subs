this<00:00:39.460> like<00:00:39.850> or<00:00:40.120> blocks<00:00:40.420> because<00:00:41.199> you

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
this like or blocks because you

00:00:47.669 --> 00:00:47.679 
pressing X and that's the easiest way to

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:49.290 
pressing X and that's the easiest way to
do<00:00:47.920> it<00:00:48.039> because<00:00:48.100> if<00:00:48.370> you<00:00:48.519> open<00:00:48.670> up<00:00:48.819> a<00:00:48.969> crafting

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
triangle 2 click move into the anvil

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.420 
triangle 2 click move into the anvil
then<00:01:41.500> you're<00:01:41.680> gonna<00:01:41.770> click<00:01:41.979> move<00:01:42.159> the<00:01:42.310> other

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
one and as you can see the block of

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.160 
one and as you can see the block of
diamond<00:01:45.159> is<00:01:45.250> duplicated<00:01:45.909> down<00:01:46.030> there<00:01:46.299> so<00:01:47.049> what

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
diamond is duplicated down there so what

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.169 
diamond is duplicated down there so what
I'm<00:01:47.259> going<00:01:47.380> to<00:01:47.409> do<00:01:47.530> from<00:01:47.740> here<00:01:47.920> is<00:01:48.070> press<00:01:48.520> Y<00:01:48.850> on

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:49.179 
I'm going to do from here is press Y on

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:50.700 
I'm going to do from here is press Y on
these<00:01:49.479> blocks<00:01:49.810> of<00:01:49.960> diamonds<00:01:50.350> that<00:01:50.409> are<00:01:50.560> up

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
these blocks of diamonds that are up

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.580 
these blocks of diamonds that are up
inside<00:01:51.250> the<00:01:51.460> anvil<00:01:51.909> and<00:01:52.170> look<00:01:53.170> at<00:01:53.289> that<00:01:53.409> it

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
inside the anvil and look at that it

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.499 
inside the anvil and look at that it
duplicate<00:01:54.039> it<00:01:54.159> both<00:01:54.340> from<00:01:55.030> there<00:01:55.179> I'm<00:01:55.390> gonna

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
duplicate it both from there I'm gonna

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:57.359 
duplicate it both from there I'm gonna
grab<00:01:55.780> this<00:01:55.990> block<00:01:56.259> of<00:01:56.499> diamond<00:01:56.859> these<00:01:57.009> two<00:01:57.219> of

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
grab this block of diamond these two of

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.069 
grab this block of diamond these two of
these<00:01:57.670> 2<00:01:57.909> blocks<00:01:58.119> of<00:01:58.359> diamonds<00:01:58.719> and<00:01:58.869> I'm<00:01:58.990> gonna

00:01:59.069 --> 00:01:59.079 
these 2 blocks of diamonds and I'm gonna

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:00.719 
these 2 blocks of diamonds and I'm gonna
put<00:01:59.320> them<00:01:59.409> next<00:01:59.740> to<00:01:59.920> each<00:02:00.070> other<00:02:00.219> and<00:02:00.520> my

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
put them next to each other and my

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.910 
put them next to each other and my
hotbar<00:02:00.969> so<00:02:01.659> when<00:02:01.749> I<00:02:01.810> press<00:02:01.960> B<00:02:02.229> they<00:02:02.530> should<00:02:02.770> be

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
hotbar so when I press B they should be

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.669 
hotbar so when I press B they should be
there<00:02:03.159> but<00:02:03.789> since<00:02:04.359> it<00:02:04.539> disappeared<00:02:04.990> that

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 
there but since it disappeared that

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:07.679 
there but since it disappeared that
means<00:02:05.890> I<00:02:06.039> did<00:02:06.219> something<00:02:06.609> wrong<00:02:06.789> or<00:02:07.119> it's<00:02:07.570> just

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
means I did something wrong or it's just

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.979 
means I did something wrong or it's just
a<00:02:07.929> little<00:02:08.080> buggy<00:02:08.409> I'm<00:02:08.769> not<00:02:09.310> exactly<00:02:09.700> sure<00:02:09.989> but

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
a little buggy I'm not exactly sure but

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:12.790 
a little buggy I'm not exactly sure but
sometimes<00:02:11.590> it<00:02:11.769> works<00:02:11.980> sometimes<00:02:12.099> it

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
sometimes it works sometimes it

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.520 
sometimes it works sometimes it
and<00:02:13.280> you<00:02:14.270> guys<00:02:14.420> just<00:02:14.750> have<00:02:14.960> to<00:02:15.110> keep<00:02:15.290> trying

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
and you guys just have to keep trying

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.200 
and you guys just have to keep trying
obviously<00:02:16.100> it's<00:02:16.250> not<00:02:16.400> really<00:02:16.730> that<00:02:16.850> hard<00:02:17.090> to

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
obviously it's not really that hard to

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.820 
obviously it's not really that hard to
keep<00:02:17.510> doing<00:02:17.840> this<00:02:17.990> over<00:02:18.230> and<00:02:18.380> over<00:02:18.560> again

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
keep doing this over and over again

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.770 
keep doing this over and over again
until<00:02:19.130> you<00:02:19.400> actually<00:02:19.580> get<00:02:19.910> it<00:02:20.060> so<00:02:20.540> I'm<00:02:20.660> gonna

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
until you actually get it so I'm gonna

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.960 
until you actually get it so I'm gonna
try<00:02:20.990> this<00:02:21.050> one<00:02:21.320> more<00:02:21.440> time<00:02:21.500> and<00:02:22.220> there<00:02:22.760> we<00:02:22.850> go

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
try this one more time and there we go

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:23.590 
try this one more time and there we go
it<00:02:23.120> worked

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
it worked

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.780 
it worked
see<00:02:23.960> as<00:02:24.140> you<00:02:24.260> can<00:02:24.380> tell<00:02:24.530> I<00:02:24.560> still<00:02:25.040> have<00:02:25.190> two

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
see as you can tell I still have two

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.510 
see as you can tell I still have two
blocks<00:02:26.060> of<00:02:26.270> diamonds<00:02:26.720> in<00:02:26.900> both<00:02:27.680> sides<00:02:28.310> of<00:02:28.460> my

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
blocks of diamonds in both sides of my

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.850 
blocks of diamonds in both sides of my
inventory<00:02:28.760> now<00:02:29.420> when<00:02:29.570> I'm<00:02:29.660> doing<00:02:29.810> press<00:02:30.290> X<00:02:30.590> and

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
the or page where I can break down

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.550 
the or page where I can break down
blocks<00:02:36.260> into<00:02:36.530> actual<00:02:37.310> like<00:02:37.490> the<00:02:37.760> or<00:02:37.970> gems<00:02:38.900> so

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
blocks into actual like the or gems so

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.500 
blocks into actual like the or gems so
you're<00:02:40.040> going<00:02:40.430> to<00:02:40.520> break<00:02:40.760> these<00:02:40.940> down<00:02:41.000> and

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
you're going to break these down and

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.110 
you're going to break these down and
also<00:02:42.470> what<00:02:42.770> else<00:02:42.890> is<00:02:43.100> buggy<00:02:43.310> about<00:02:43.670> this<00:02:43.880> see

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
into blocks of diamonds so as you can

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.550 
into blocks of diamonds so as you can
tell<00:03:13.400> I<00:03:13.610> had<00:03:13.850> to<00:03:14.150> now<00:03:14.660> I<00:03:14.690> have<00:03:14.900> four<00:03:15.170> so<00:03:15.470> I'm

into half so it's two and two put the

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.610 
into half so it's two and two put the
two<00:03:22.220> up<00:03:22.490> there<00:03:22.700> and<00:03:23.000> the<00:03:23.720> other<00:03:23.959> two<00:03:24.200> and<00:03:24.500> as

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
two up there and the other two and as

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:25.960 
two up there and the other two and as
you<00:03:24.770> can<00:03:24.860> tell<00:03:24.920> I<00:03:25.040> have<00:03:25.130> a<00:03:25.280> block<00:03:25.550> of<00:03:25.670> diamond

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
you can tell I have a block of diamond

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.640 
you can tell I have a block of diamond
down<00:03:26.090> there<00:03:26.300> and<00:03:26.450> then<00:03:26.600> I'm<00:03:26.720> going<00:03:26.750> to<00:03:27.110> press<00:03:27.410> Y

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
down there and then I'm going to press Y

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.130 
down there and then I'm going to press Y
again<00:03:28.070> on<00:03:28.459> the<00:03:29.030> actual<00:03:29.480> diamond<00:03:29.810> blocks<00:03:30.020> that

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
again on the actual diamond blocks that

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.590 
again on the actual diamond blocks that
are<00:03:30.230> inside<00:03:30.530> the<00:03:30.620> anvil<00:03:31.010> and<00:03:31.240> as<00:03:32.240> you<00:03:32.420> could

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
are inside the anvil and as you could

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.260 
are inside the anvil and as you could
tell<00:03:32.780> now<00:03:33.560> I<00:03:33.590> have<00:03:33.920> four<00:03:34.220> and<00:03:34.370> four<00:03:34.610> so<00:03:35.060> if<00:03:35.180> I

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
tell now I have four and four so if I

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.820 
tell now I have four and four so if I
bring<00:03:35.480> this<00:03:35.630> down<00:03:35.690> here<00:03:36.140> and<00:03:36.350> hopefully<00:03:36.680> it'll

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
bring this down here and hopefully it'll

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.830 
bring this down here and hopefully it'll
work<00:03:37.010> this<00:03:37.220> time<00:03:37.280> and<00:03:37.700> it<00:03:37.850> did<00:03:38.060> I<00:03:38.270> can<00:03:38.750> now

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
work this time and it did I can now

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.430 
work this time and it did I can now
break<00:03:39.110> these<00:03:39.350> down<00:03:39.380> into<00:03:40.450> diamonds<00:03:41.450> so<00:03:42.380> I'm

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
break these down into diamonds so I'm

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.170 
break these down into diamonds so I'm
gonna<00:03:42.560> break<00:03:42.770> these<00:03:42.920> down<00:03:42.980> and<00:03:43.459> there<00:03:44.000> you<00:03:44.060> go

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
gonna break these down and there you go

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.840 
gonna break these down and there you go
I<00:03:44.209> have<00:03:44.510> 64<00:03:45.470> stack<00:03:45.740> of<00:03:45.950> diamonds<00:03:46.430> and<00:03:46.490> ain't

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
I have 64 stack of diamonds and ain't

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.780 
I have 64 stack of diamonds and ain't
more<00:03:47.120> so<00:03:47.660> it<00:03:47.810> should<00:03:48.020> give<00:03:48.230> me<00:03:48.380> eight<00:03:48.790> blocks

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
more so it should give me eight blocks

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.160 
more so it should give me eight blocks
of<00:03:50.050> diamonds<00:03:51.050> so<00:03:52.180> as<00:03:53.180> you<00:03:53.300> can<00:03:53.420> tell<00:03:53.600> I<00:03:53.840> keep

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
of diamonds so as you can tell I keep

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.040 
of diamonds so as you can tell I keep
duplicating<00:03:54.680> more<00:03:55.490> and<00:03:55.760> more<00:03:56.090> as<00:03:56.360> I<00:03:56.840> keep

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
duplicating more and more as I keep

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.780 
duplicating more and more as I keep
doing<00:03:57.230> this<00:03:57.410> and<00:03:57.680> it's<00:03:57.890> pretty<00:03:58.070> fast<00:03:58.370> and<00:03:58.700> it

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
doing this and it's pretty fast and it

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.540 
doing this and it's pretty fast and it
hasn't<00:03:58.970> been<00:03:59.240> that<00:03:59.300> long<00:03:59.510> either<00:04:00.050> so<00:04:00.800> what<00:04:01.070> so

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550 
hasn't been that long either so what so

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.520 
hasn't been that long either so what so
every<00:04:01.910> time<00:04:02.060> you<00:04:02.240> get<00:04:02.390> more<00:04:02.959> blocks<00:04:03.350> of

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
every time you get more blocks of

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.260 
every time you get more blocks of
diamonds<00:04:03.860> or<00:04:03.950> ever<00:04:04.130> you're<00:04:04.310> duplicating<00:04:04.970> it

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
diamonds or ever you're duplicating it

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.570 
diamonds or ever you're duplicating it
will<00:04:05.959> go<00:04:06.140> up<00:04:06.320> a<00:04:06.500> lot<00:04:06.650> faster<00:04:06.860> so<00:04:07.280> I'm<00:04:07.340> gonna<00:04:07.459> do

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
will go up a lot faster so I'm gonna do

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.100 
will go up a lot faster so I'm gonna do
it<00:04:07.640> one<00:04:07.730> more<00:04:07.790> time<00:04:07.940> for<00:04:08.300> you<00:04:08.390> guys<00:04:10.810> and<00:04:11.810> there

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
it one more time for you guys and there

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.000 
it one more time for you guys and there
you<00:04:12.170> go<00:04:12.350> it<00:04:12.590> worked

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
you go it worked

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.720 
you go it worked
break<00:04:13.670> it<00:04:13.820> down<00:04:13.850> into<00:04:14.120> diamonds<00:04:15.459> and<00:04:16.459> look<00:04:16.640> at

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
break it down into diamonds and look at

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.330 
break it down into diamonds and look at
that<00:04:16.850> I<00:04:16.880> have<00:04:17.090> two<00:04:17.299> sets<00:04:17.630> of<00:04:17.780> diamonds<00:04:18.350> and<00:04:18.620> I

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
that I have two sets of diamonds and I

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.010 
that I have two sets of diamonds and I
have<00:04:19.580> no<00:04:19.730> idea<00:04:19.970> how<00:04:20.209> long<00:04:20.419> it's<00:04:20.660> been<00:04:20.750> I<00:04:20.870> think

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:21.020 
have no idea how long it's been I think

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:22.570 
have no idea how long it's been I think
it's<00:04:21.290> been<00:04:21.440> about<00:04:21.560> like<00:04:21.680> four<00:04:22.040> minutes<00:04:22.370> and

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
it's been about like four minutes and

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.820 
it's been about like four minutes and
that's<00:04:23.210> not<00:04:23.479> long<00:04:23.720> at<00:04:23.870> all<00:04:23.990> and<00:04:24.229> it's<00:04:24.919> a<00:04:25.010> lot<00:04:25.190> of

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
that's not long at all and it's a lot of

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.969 
that's not long at all and it's a lot of
less<00:04:26.340> time<00:04:26.669> than<00:04:26.909> it<00:04:27.120> usually<00:04:27.330> is<00:04:27.569> to<00:04:28.409> mine<00:04:28.680> all

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
less time than it usually is to mine all

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.790 
less time than it usually is to mine all
that<00:04:29.250> so<00:04:29.689> here<00:04:30.689> we<00:04:30.810> go<00:04:30.930> I'm<00:04:31.080> gonna<00:04:31.199> book<00:04:31.680> the

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
that so here we go I'm gonna book the

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.159 
that so here we go I'm gonna book the
cinema<00:04:32.220> have<00:04:32.340> 16<00:04:32.819> now<00:04:33.030> so<00:04:33.300> I<00:04:33.330> started<00:04:33.840> off<00:04:33.990> with

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
cinema have 16 now so I started off with

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.610 
cinema have 16 now so I started off with
2<00:04:34.349> and<00:04:34.620> now<00:04:34.710> I<00:04:34.740> have<00:04:34.979> 16<00:04:35.610> which<00:04:36.240> is<00:04:36.270> crazy<00:04:37.110> fast

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
2 and now I have 16 which is crazy fast

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.040 
2 and now I have 16 which is crazy fast
and<00:04:38.069> I<00:04:38.219> think<00:04:38.460> it's<00:04:38.580> really<00:04:38.789> easy<00:04:39.360> to<00:04:39.689> do<00:04:39.840> this

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
and I think it's really easy to do this

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.230 
and I think it's really easy to do this
and<00:04:40.259> I'm<00:04:40.409> gonna<00:04:40.500> do<00:04:40.680> it<00:04:40.710> one<00:04:41.129> more<00:04:41.219> time<00:04:41.400> so

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
and I'm gonna do it one more time so

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.670 
and I'm gonna do it one more time so
let's<00:04:42.419> go<00:04:42.569> ahead<00:04:42.810> and<00:04:42.990> break<00:04:43.169> those<00:04:43.349> two<00:04:43.530> down

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
let's go ahead and break those two down

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.980 
let's go ahead and break those two down
place<00:04:44.159> them<00:04:44.310> both<00:04:44.460> into<00:04:44.819> there<00:04:45.030> that's<00:04:45.719> why

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
place them both into there that's why

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.830 
place them both into there that's why
bring<00:04:46.830> it<00:04:46.949> down<00:04:47.099> into<00:04:47.370> my<00:04:47.490> inventory<00:04:47.840> hotbar

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
bring it down into my inventory hotbar

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.369 
bring it down into my inventory hotbar
and<00:04:49.139> exile<00:04:49.979> that<00:04:50.009> and<00:04:50.610> there<00:04:51.300> we<00:04:51.419> go<00:04:51.629> I'll<00:04:52.139> have

00:04:52.369 --> 00:04:52.379 
and exile that and there we go I'll have

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:54.770 
and exile that and there we go I'll have
16<00:04:52.860> and<00:04:53.009> 16<00:04:53.370> if<00:04:53.550> I<00:04:53.639> break<00:04:53.849> these<00:04:54.060> down<00:04:54.120> and<00:04:54.629> then

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
16 and 16 if I break these down and then

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.300 
16 and 16 if I break these down and then
go<00:04:54.960> place<00:04:55.229> them<00:04:55.409> in<00:04:55.500> the<00:04:55.620> diamond<00:04:55.949> clock<00:04:56.159> so

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
go place them in the diamond clock so

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.930 
go place them in the diamond clock so
I'll<00:04:56.430> have<00:04:56.610> I<00:04:56.939> think<00:04:57.780> 32<00:04:58.400> don't<00:04:59.400> judge<00:04:59.639> me<00:04:59.819> if

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
I'll have I think 32 don't judge me if

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.080 
I'll have I think 32 don't judge me if
my<00:05:00.090> math<00:05:00.330> is<00:05:00.360> bad<00:05:00.719> but<00:05:01.199> I<00:05:01.440> should<00:05:02.400> have<00:05:02.430> 32

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
my math is bad but I should have 32

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.570 
my math is bad but I should have 32
blocks<00:05:03.690> of<00:05:03.930> diamond<00:05:04.349> now<00:05:04.469> so<00:05:04.710> always<00:05:05.009> doubles

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
blocks of diamond now so always doubles

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.180 
blocks of diamond now so always doubles
so<00:05:06.210> if<00:05:06.389> I<00:05:06.509> were<00:05:06.629> to<00:05:06.659> do<00:05:06.900> 32<00:05:07.379> and<00:05:07.530> 32<00:05:07.740> I'll<00:05:08.009> have

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
so if I were to do 32 and 32 I'll have

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:14.420 
so if I were to do 32 and 32 I'll have
64<00:05:08.789> from<00:05:09.150> there<00:05:12.050> and<00:05:13.050> there<00:05:13.379> we<00:05:13.469> go<00:05:13.590> 32<00:05:14.159> I<00:05:14.190> was

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 
from two blocks of diamond to sixty four

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:27.110 
from two blocks of diamond to sixty four
blocks<00:05:24.840> of<00:05:25.080> diamonds<00:05:25.560> that's<00:05:26.189> crazy<00:05:26.610> so<00:05:27.090> let's

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
blocks of diamonds that's crazy so let's

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.279 
blocks of diamonds that's crazy so let's
do<00:05:27.479> that<00:05:27.629> one<00:05:27.810> more<00:05:27.960> time

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:28.289 
do that one more time

bring that down and okay so I didn't

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:33.860 
bring that down and okay so I didn't
exactly<00:05:32.490> do<00:05:32.969> it<00:05:33.120> as<00:05:33.240> I<00:05:33.389> should<00:05:33.629> have

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
exactly do it as I should have

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.140 
exactly do it as I should have
I<00:05:34.110> didn't<00:05:34.710> bring<00:05:34.860> it<00:05:35.039> down<00:05:35.190> into<00:05:35.550> the<00:05:35.639> hot<00:05:35.849> Barb

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
I didn't bring it down into the hot Barb

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.999 
I didn't bring it down into the hot Barb
which<00:05:36.449> doesn't<00:05:36.840> matter<00:05:36.960> you<00:05:37.229> could<00:05:37.349> leave<00:05:37.830> it

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:38.009 
which doesn't matter you could leave it

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:40.580 
which doesn't matter you could leave it
just<00:05:38.039> like<00:05:38.460> I<00:05:38.639> did<00:05:38.699> up<00:05:39.000> here<00:05:39.110> it's<00:05:40.110> V<00:05:40.259> if<00:05:40.440> you

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
just like I did up here it's V if you

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:41.809 
just like I did up here it's V if you
could<00:05:40.710> see<00:05:40.860> in<00:05:40.919> the<00:05:41.009> bottom<00:05:41.279> right<00:05:41.460> corner<00:05:41.789> of

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:41.819 
could see in the bottom right corner of

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:43.730 
could see in the bottom right corner of
my<00:05:41.909> inventory<00:05:42.210> there's<00:05:42.750> one<00:05:42.960> in<00:05:43.169> the<00:05:43.440> actual

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
my inventory there's one in the actual

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.079 
my inventory there's one in the actual
inventory<00:05:43.949> and<00:05:44.250> one<00:05:44.339> on<00:05:44.520> the<00:05:44.639> hot<00:05:44.789> bar<00:05:45.029> it

00:05:45.079 --> 00:05:45.089 
inventory and one on the hot bar it

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:46.730 
inventory and one on the hot bar it
doesn't<00:05:45.240> matter<00:05:45.509> as<00:05:45.750> long<00:05:46.080> as<00:05:46.319> they're<00:05:46.560> both

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
doesn't matter as long as they're both

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.360 
doesn't matter as long as they're both
there<00:05:47.129> so<00:05:48.120> let's<00:05:48.870> go<00:05:48.990> ahead<00:05:49.379> and<00:05:49.680> break<00:05:50.190> these

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
there so let's go ahead and break these

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.459 
there so let's go ahead and break these
down<00:05:50.430> and<00:05:51.240> I'm<00:05:51.479> gonna<00:05:51.599> show<00:05:51.810> you<00:05:51.839> guys<00:05:52.020> I'm

00:05:52.459 --> 00:05:52.469 
down and I'm gonna show you guys I'm

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:57.140 
down and I'm gonna show you guys I'm
gonna<00:05:52.710> have<00:05:53.539> 64<00:05:54.539> sack<00:05:55.020> of<00:05:55.370> diamond<00:05:56.370> blocks<00:05:56.819> in

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
gonna have 64 sack of diamond blocks in

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.019 
gonna have 64 sack of diamond blocks in
what<00:05:57.719> five<00:05:58.050> minutes<00:05:58.440> six<00:05:58.919> minutes<00:05:59.009> that's<00:05:59.610> not

00:06:00.019 --> 00:06:00.029 
what five minutes six minutes that's not

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:01.309 
what five minutes six minutes that's not
much<00:06:00.719> at<00:06:00.750> all

00:06:01.309 --> 00:06:01.319 
much at all

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:03.589 
much at all
and<00:06:01.620> I<00:06:01.949> think<00:06:02.009> this<00:06:02.339> glitch<00:06:02.610> is<00:06:02.789> really<00:06:03.240> fast

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:03.599 
and I think this glitch is really fast

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:06.740 
and I think this glitch is really fast
and<00:06:03.930> really<00:06:04.650> really<00:06:05.159> easy<00:06:05.460> to<00:06:05.729> do<00:06:05.969> and<00:06:06.210> it

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
and really really easy to do and it

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.409 
and really really easy to do and it
gives<00:06:06.990> you<00:06:07.500> the<00:06:07.710> most<00:06:07.949> resources<00:06:08.849> out<00:06:09.029> of<00:06:09.180> any

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:09.419 
gives you the most resources out of any

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:11.180 
gives you the most resources out of any
other<00:06:09.659> duplication<00:06:10.349> glitch<00:06:10.379> I've<00:06:10.740> seen<00:06:11.069> on

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.190 
other duplication glitch I've seen on

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:14.450 
other duplication glitch I've seen on
xbox<00:06:11.759> so<00:06:12.479> far<00:06:12.830> just<00:06:13.830> like<00:06:14.039> the<00:06:14.129> other<00:06:14.279> one

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 
xbox so far just like the other one

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:15.920 
xbox so far just like the other one
there's<00:06:14.639> the<00:06:14.759> one<00:06:14.940> where<00:06:14.969> you<00:06:15.389> take<00:06:15.569> a<00:06:15.629> pickaxe

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
there's the one where you take a pickaxe

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.050 
there's the one where you take a pickaxe
and<00:06:16.440> break<00:06:16.860> it<00:06:17.099> but<00:06:17.610> I'm<00:06:17.699> not<00:06:17.789> going<00:06:17.940> to<00:06:18.000> do

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 
and break it but I'm not going to do

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.640 
and break it but I'm not going to do
that<00:06:18.210> for<00:06:18.360> you<00:06:18.449> guys<00:06:18.599> because<00:06:18.900> that<00:06:19.139> one<00:06:19.319> takes

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:19.650 
that for you guys because that one takes

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.459 
that for you guys because that one takes
forever<00:06:20.219> to<00:06:20.699> do<00:06:20.909> and<00:06:21.180> this<00:06:21.659> one<00:06:21.839> is<00:06:22.050> probably

00:06:22.459 --> 00:06:22.469 
forever to do and this one is probably

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:24.409 
forever to do and this one is probably
by<00:06:22.860> far<00:06:22.889> the<00:06:23.339> easiest<00:06:23.490> one<00:06:23.940> because<00:06:24.180> as<00:06:24.300> you

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:24.419 
by far the easiest one because as you

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:26.089 
by far the easiest one because as you
can<00:06:24.509> tell<00:06:24.569> I<00:06:24.810> can<00:06:24.839> still<00:06:25.169> place<00:06:25.409> these<00:06:25.589> down<00:06:25.830> I

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:26.099 
can tell I can still place these down I

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:27.379 
can tell I can still place these down I
could<00:06:26.520> break<00:06:26.729> them<00:06:26.879> down<00:06:27.060> I<00:06:27.089> could<00:06:27.300> do

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:27.389 
could break them down I could do

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:28.820 
could break them down I could do
whatever<00:06:27.569> I<00:06:27.750> want<00:06:28.169> with<00:06:28.259> them<00:06:28.440> now<00:06:28.620> because

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.830 
whatever I want with them now because

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.800 
whatever I want with them now because
they<00:06:29.129> are<00:06:29.159> my<00:06:29.400> diamonds<00:06:29.879> and<00:06:30.210> I<00:06:30.509> duplicated

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:30.810 
they are my diamonds and I duplicated

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:34.010 
they are my diamonds and I duplicated
them<00:06:31.289> and<00:06:31.500> they<00:06:31.680> actually<00:06:31.860> count<00:06:32.400> as<00:06:32.550> a<00:06:33.020> whole

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020 
them and they actually count as a whole

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.300 
them and they actually count as a whole
block<00:06:34.409> and<00:06:34.440> and

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:35.310

and real diamonds so as you can tell I'm

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.240 
and real diamonds so as you can tell I'm
