myself this is a minority attack
structure<00:01:51.270> sort<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.380> anyway<00:01:52.680> not<00:01:53.610> really<00:01:53.970> a

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
structure sort of anyway not really a

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.749 
structure sort of anyway not really a
minority<00:01:54.509> attack<00:01:54.840> anymore<00:01:55.560> position<00:01:56.520> has

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
minority attack anymore position has

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.350 
minority attack anymore position has
become<00:01:57.689> kind<00:01:58.290> of<00:01:58.439> original<00:01:59.040> in<00:01:59.430> the<00:02:00.090> sense

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
become kind of original in the sense

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.530 
become kind of original in the sense
that<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:01.590> bishop<00:02:02.159> pair<00:02:02.549> now<00:02:02.820> for<00:02:03.090> black<00:02:03.299> is

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
that the bishop pair now for black is

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.999 
that the bishop pair now for black is
normally<00:02:03.869> not<00:02:03.930> something<00:02:04.320> black<00:02:04.500> guess<00:02:04.770> and

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
normally not something black guess and

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.499 
normally not something black guess and
so<00:02:05.100> I'm<00:02:05.189> happy<00:02:05.490> about<00:02:05.579> that<00:02:05.700> but<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.210> didn't

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
so I'm happy about that but it didn't

move<00:06:03.039> just<00:06:03.219> too<00:06:03.400> so<00:06:03.819> that's<00:06:04.000> that's<00:06:04.150> bullet

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630

technique<00:06:05.080> kids<00:06:05.349> I<00:06:05.560> guess<00:06:05.800> not<00:06:06.099> necessarily

00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:06.969 
technique kids I guess not necessarily

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:10.649 
technique kids I guess not necessarily
the<00:06:07.180> most<00:06:07.210> accurate<00:06:08.340> win<00:06:09.340> but<00:06:09.940> the<00:06:10.300> position

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:10.659 
the most accurate win but the position

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:13.200 
the most accurate win but the position
was<00:06:11.080> interesting<00:06:11.500> there<00:06:11.650> I<00:06:11.710> I<00:06:12.370> think<00:06:13.000> what<00:06:13.120> the

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.210 
was interesting there I I think what the

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:14.850 
was interesting there I I think what the
outside<00:06:13.539> passed<00:06:13.780> pawn<00:06:14.020> I<00:06:14.169> should<00:06:14.380> just<00:06:14.560> simply

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:14.860 
outside passed pawn I should just simply

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.080 
outside passed pawn I should just simply
have<00:06:14.949> been<00:06:14.979> after<00:06:15.340> picking<00:06:15.639> up<00:06:15.789> this<00:06:15.909> guy

have been after picking up this guy
should<00:06:16.150> have<00:06:16.300> just<00:06:16.479> been<00:06:16.630> more<00:06:16.810> aggressive

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 
should have just been more aggressive

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.860 
should have just been more aggressive
advancing<00:06:18.310> the<00:06:18.400> ape<00:06:18.520> on<00:06:18.759> here<00:06:18.969> a5<00:06:19.449> bring<00:06:19.780> the
