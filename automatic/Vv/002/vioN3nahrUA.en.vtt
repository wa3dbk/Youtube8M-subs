the<00:00:18.930> first<00:00:19.199> opinions<00:00:20.119> first<00:00:21.119> impressions

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
the first opinions first impressions

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.380 
the first opinions first impressions
I've<00:00:21.750> been<00:00:21.869> out<00:00:21.990> here<00:00:22.109> for<00:00:22.289> about<00:00:23.240> half<00:00:24.240> an

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
I've been out here for about half an

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.810 
I've been out here for about half an
hour<00:00:24.449> or<00:00:24.750> so<00:00:25.050> now<00:00:25.199> just<00:00:25.470> tasting<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.859> mint

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:35.600 

definitely<00:00:31.460> do<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.579> job<00:00:33.860> you<00:00:34.860> lose<00:00:35.040> some<00:00:35.280> sort

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
definitely do the job you lose some sort

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.420 
definitely do the job you lose some sort
of<00:00:35.670> maneuverability<00:00:36.300> which<00:00:36.660> was<00:00:36.870> expected

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.680 

now<00:00:41.430> now<00:00:41.610> some<00:00:41.820> people<00:00:41.940> don't<00:00:42.239> like<00:00:42.360> rudders

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
now now some people don't like rudders

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.750 
now now some people don't like rudders
and<00:00:42.719> I<00:00:43.200> did<00:00:43.500> mention<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.980> earlier<00:00:44.309> video

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
and I did mention in the earlier video

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.299 
and I did mention in the earlier video
that<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:45.530> actually<00:00:46.530> have<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.800> rudder<00:00:47.039> on<00:00:47.100> this

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
that I actually have a rudder on this

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.670 
that I actually have a rudder on this
kayak<00:00:47.930> and<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:49.590> think<00:00:49.860> if<00:00:49.950> you're<00:00:50.070> going<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.370> add

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
kayak and I think if you're going to add

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.770 
kayak and I think if you're going to add
these<00:00:52.850> not<00:00:53.850> saying<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.329> can't<00:00:54.539> add<00:00:54.660> them

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
these not saying that you can't add them

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.450 
these not saying that you can't add them
to<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:54.989> crack<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.739> doesn't<00:00:56.070> have<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.219> rudder

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
to a crack that doesn't have a rudder

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.590 
to a crack that doesn't have a rudder
but<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.570> do<00:00:57.780> lose<00:00:59.059> the<00:01:00.059> ability<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.420> perform

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
but you do lose the ability to perform

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.959 
but you do lose the ability to perform
some<00:01:01.020> certain<00:01:01.320> turning<00:01:01.649> strokes<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.879> know

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
some certain turning strokes you know

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.200 
some certain turning strokes you know
like<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.180> long<00:01:03.480> draw<00:01:03.750> stroke<00:01:04.309> and<00:01:05.309> back<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:06.090> the

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
like a long draw stroke and back to the

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.300 
like a long draw stroke and back to the
kayak<00:01:06.390> obviously<00:01:07.110> if<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.320> trying<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.159> reach

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
kayak obviously if you trying to reach

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.380 
kayak obviously if you trying to reach
out<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.670> far<00:01:08.880> away

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
out and far away

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.660 
out and far away
end<00:01:09.810> up<00:01:09.930> coming<00:01:10.260> in<00:01:10.350> contact<00:01:10.560> as<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.400> can<00:01:11.490> see

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
end up coming in contact as you can see

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.789 
end up coming in contact as you can see
contact<00:01:12.150> with<00:01:12.299> yeah<00:01:12.860> with<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.979> pontoon<00:01:15.799> so

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
contact with yeah with the pontoon so

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.230 
contact with yeah with the pontoon so
you<00:01:16.860> do<00:01:17.070> lose<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.310> little<00:01:17.640> bit<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:17.970> but

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
you do lose a little bit of that but

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.200 
you do lose a little bit of that but
obviously

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
obviously

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.090 
obviously
you're<00:01:21.200> probably<00:01:21.290> not<00:01:21.470> going<00:01:21.620> to<00:01:21.680> be<00:01:21.800> doing<00:01:21.920> a

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
you're probably not going to be doing a

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.470 
you're probably not going to be doing a
lot<00:01:22.220> of<00:01:22.250> those<00:01:22.400> big<00:01:22.640> maneuvering<00:01:23.150> strokes

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:23.480 
lot of those big maneuvering strokes

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.780 
lot of those big maneuvering strokes
like<00:01:23.750> big<00:01:24.050> wide<00:01:24.290> turns<00:01:24.530> like<00:01:24.830> that<00:01:24.860> we<00:01:25.580> still

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
like big wide turns like that we still

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.000 
like big wide turns like that we still
have<00:01:26.000> a<00:01:26.300> pretty<00:01:26.900> good<00:01:27.110> room<00:01:27.320> we're<00:01:27.680> gonna<00:01:27.800> see

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 
have a pretty good room we're gonna see

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.850 
have a pretty good room we're gonna see
I<00:01:28.250> think<00:01:28.640> this<00:01:29.270> is<00:01:29.420> a<00:01:29.450> this<00:01:30.290> paddles<00:01:30.620> about<00:01:30.830> a

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
I think this is a this paddles about a

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.420 
I think this is a this paddles about a
220<00:01:31.310> I<00:01:32.180> might<00:01:33.170> grab<00:01:33.380> a<00:01:33.410> shorter<00:01:33.770> two<00:01:33.980> meter<00:01:34.220> one

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
220 I might grab a shorter two meter one

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.690 
220 I might grab a shorter two meter one
perhaps<00:01:34.700> and<00:01:35.570> that<00:01:35.690> might<00:01:35.900> assist<00:01:36.200> in<00:01:36.440> that

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
perhaps and that might assist in that

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.980 
perhaps and that might assist in that
paddle<00:01:37.700> what<00:01:37.940> I'm<00:01:38.030> flying<00:01:38.180> over<00:01:38.360> there<00:01:38.600> I'm

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
paddle what I'm flying over there I'm

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.720 
paddle what I'm flying over there I'm
hitting<00:01:39.260> this<00:01:39.350> right<00:01:39.590> one<00:01:39.800> why<00:01:40.370> not<00:01:40.520> have<00:01:40.700> that

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:40.730 
hitting this right one why not have that

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.220 
hitting this right one why not have that
situated<00:01:41.390> before<00:01:41.990> than<00:01:42.350> I<00:01:42.410> did<00:01:42.560> the<00:01:42.650> left<00:01:42.800> one

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.230 
situated before than I did the left one

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.590 
situated before than I did the left one
but<00:01:45.230> overall<00:01:45.530> very<00:01:45.830> impressed<00:01:46.520> and<00:01:46.820> as<00:01:47.450> you

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
but overall very impressed and as you

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.140 
but overall very impressed and as you
can<00:01:47.660> see<00:01:47.720> they<00:01:47.960> do<00:01:48.140> their<00:01:48.320> job

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
can see they do their job

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:55.770 
can see they do their job
imitation<00:01:50.150> in<00:01:50.830> you<00:01:51.830> know<00:01:51.890> flapping<00:01:52.580> around

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.170 

sitting<00:01:56.780> sidesaddle<00:01:57.130> in<00:01:58.130> the<00:01:58.250> kayak<00:01:58.460> and<00:01:58.790> sort

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
sitting sidesaddle in the kayak and sort

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.910 
sitting sidesaddle in the kayak and sort
of<00:01:59.210> leaning<00:01:59.479> over<00:01:59.630> see<00:02:00.350> they're<00:02:00.500> fairly<00:02:00.680> deep

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
of leaning over see they're fairly deep

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.640 
of leaning over see they're fairly deep
in<00:02:01.040> the<00:02:01.130> water<00:02:01.340> they<00:02:05.229> seem<00:02:06.229> to<00:02:06.320> be<00:02:06.410> holding

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
in the water they seem to be holding

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.410 
in the water they seem to be holding
well<00:02:08.260> the<00:02:09.260> way<00:02:09.380> I've<00:02:09.500> got<00:02:09.530> them<00:02:09.800> set<00:02:10.790> up<00:02:10.910> is<00:02:11.120> a

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
well the way I've got them set up is a

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.190 
well the way I've got them set up is a
little<00:02:12.200> bit<00:02:12.440> of<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:12.709> water<00:02:12.860> each<00:02:13.360> so<00:02:14.360> it's<00:02:15.080> not

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
little bit of the water each so it's not

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.690 
little bit of the water each so it's not
to<00:02:15.410> actually<00:02:15.530> lean<00:02:15.860> over<00:02:16.040> that<00:02:16.160> way<00:02:16.370> that<00:02:16.580> will

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
to actually lean over that way that will

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.880 
to actually lean over that way that will
make<00:02:16.880> contact<00:02:17.120> I<00:02:17.660> sit<00:02:18.260> in<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.440> water<00:02:18.680> a<00:02:18.770> little

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
make contact I sit in the water a little

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.449 
make contact I sit in the water a little
bit<00:02:18.980> but<00:02:19.220> slightly<00:02:20.740> dr.<00:02:21.740> only<00:02:22.010> very<00:02:22.220> lightly

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
bit but slightly dr. only very lightly

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.570 
bit but slightly dr. only very lightly
they<00:02:23.150> do<00:02:23.209> obviously<00:02:23.540> inhibit<00:02:24.080> speed<00:02:24.580> and

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
they do obviously inhibit speed and

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.320 
they do obviously inhibit speed and
progress<00:02:27.070> but<00:02:28.070> it<00:02:28.550> still<00:02:28.790> certainly<00:02:29.150> not

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
progress but it still certainly not

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.960 
progress but it still certainly not
enough<00:02:29.600> to<00:02:30.250> stop<00:02:31.250> you<00:02:31.400> from<00:02:31.489> putting<00:02:31.730> them

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
enough to stop you from putting them

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.400 
enough to stop you from putting them
down<00:02:32.150> and<00:02:32.330> then<00:02:32.450> paddling<00:02:32.900> sort<00:02:33.110> of<00:02:33.170> a<00:02:33.230> few

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
down and then paddling sort of a few

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:34.840 
down and then paddling sort of a few
case<00:02:33.620> your<00:02:33.860> destination<00:02:34.370> I<00:02:34.430> think<00:02:34.640> that<00:02:34.730> has

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
case your destination I think that has

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.540 
case your destination I think that has
certainly<00:02:35.060> be<00:02:35.180> possible<00:02:36.190> and<00:02:37.190> I<00:02:37.280> think

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
certainly be possible and I think

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.130 
certainly be possible and I think
probably<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:38.000> big<00:02:38.269> question<00:02:38.660> or<00:02:38.840> at<00:02:38.900> least<00:02:39.050> I

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
probably the big question or at least I

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.449 
probably the big question or at least I
know<00:02:39.290> what<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:39.530> big<00:02:39.680> question<00:02:40.010> was<00:02:40.160> for<00:02:40.340> me

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
know what the big question was for me

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.660 
know what the big question was for me
when<00:02:40.640> I<00:02:40.700> first<00:02:40.910> did<00:02:41.120> this<00:02:41.290> was<00:02:42.290> can<00:02:43.280> you<00:02:43.430> stand

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
when I first did this was can you stand

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:59.050 
when I first did this was can you stand
up<00:02:43.820> it<00:02:45.489> is<00:02:47.830> yes<00:02:57.610> jump<00:02:58.610> around

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
up it is yes jump around

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.900 
up it is yes jump around
I<00:02:59.470> think<00:03:02.440> that's<00:03:03.440> not<00:03:03.590> a<00:03:03.620> problem<00:03:03.830> at<00:03:04.010> all<00:03:04.190> yeah

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
I think that's not a problem at all yeah

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.490 
I think that's not a problem at all yeah
one<00:03:05.299> of<00:03:05.330> the<00:03:05.450> biggest<00:03:05.570> benefits<00:03:05.840> I<00:03:06.170> think<00:03:06.200> of

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
one of the biggest benefits I think of

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.310 
one of the biggest benefits I think of
this<00:03:06.620> is<00:03:07.269> gonna<00:03:08.269> be<00:03:08.420> able<00:03:08.510> to<00:03:08.690> jump<00:03:09.080> out<00:03:09.230> the

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
this is gonna be able to jump out the

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.500 
this is gonna be able to jump out the
back<00:03:09.549> it<00:03:10.549> sit<00:03:10.700> on<00:03:10.760> the<00:03:10.880> back<00:03:11.030> you<00:03:11.150> have<00:03:11.269> a<00:03:11.299> fish

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
back it sit on the back you have a fish

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.250 
back it sit on the back you have a fish
trap<00:03:11.750> here

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
trap here

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.949 
trap here
give<00:03:14.250> me<00:03:14.370> a<00:03:14.400> little<00:03:14.550> bit<00:03:14.640> better<00:03:14.970> view<00:03:15.390> I've

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
give me a little bit better view I've

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.960 
give me a little bit better view I've
man<00:03:16.140> fitted<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:16.620> rear<00:03:17.220> rod<00:03:17.430> holders<00:03:17.790> so<00:03:17.910> I'll

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
man fitted the rear rod holders so I'll

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.820 
man fitted the rear rod holders so I'll
have<00:03:18.090> to<00:03:18.180> be<00:03:18.330> careful<00:03:18.690> where<00:03:18.840> they<00:03:18.870> situated

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
have to be careful where they situated

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.509 
have to be careful where they situated
all<00:03:19.920> what<00:03:20.040> I'm<00:03:20.129> doing<00:03:20.400> those<00:03:20.550> at<00:03:20.730> that<00:03:20.849> point

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
all what I'm doing those at that point

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.509 
all what I'm doing those at that point
as<00:03:23.519> you<00:03:23.640> can<00:03:23.760> say<00:03:23.910> like<00:03:24.060> this<00:03:24.239> you<00:03:24.420> know

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
as you can say like this you know

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:32.860 
as you can say like this you know
on<00:03:26.610> smacking<00:03:27.030> my<00:03:27.150> legs<00:03:27.360> I<00:03:27.480> buy<00:03:30.440> everything<00:03:31.489> so

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
on smacking my legs I buy everything so

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.199 
on smacking my legs I buy everything so
I<00:03:33.870> guess<00:03:34.709> see<00:03:34.890> I<00:03:36.019> guess<00:03:37.019> I've<00:03:37.200> serve<00:03:37.769> a<00:03:37.920> purpose

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
I guess see I guess I've serve a purpose

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:43.460 
I guess see I guess I've serve a purpose
which<00:03:39.209> is<00:03:39.239> to<00:03:39.590> stabilize<00:03:41.810> I<00:03:42.810> was<00:03:43.230> really

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
which is to stabilize I was really

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.750 
which is to stabilize I was really
curious<00:03:43.620> to<00:03:43.769> see<00:03:43.860> if<00:03:43.980> I<00:03:44.099> could<00:03:44.220> stand<00:03:44.459> up<00:03:44.580> I'm

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
curious to see if I could stand up I'm

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.009 
curious to see if I could stand up I'm
really<00:03:44.970> happy<00:03:45.120> with<00:03:45.269> the<00:03:45.390> fact<00:03:45.569> that<00:03:45.630> I<00:03:45.780> can<00:03:45.989> I

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
really happy with the fact that I can I

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.850 
really happy with the fact that I can I
can<00:03:46.349> jump<00:03:47.040> around<00:03:47.190> bigger<00:03:47.910> challenge<00:03:48.299> that

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
can jump around bigger challenge that

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.199 
can jump around bigger challenge that
he's<00:03:49.860> actually<00:03:50.040> getting<00:03:50.370> them<00:03:50.730> deployed

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
he's actually getting them deployed

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.180 
he's actually getting them deployed
because<00:03:52.110> obviously<00:03:52.290> when<00:03:52.709> you're<00:03:52.829> at<00:03:52.980> you

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
because obviously when you're at you

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.860 
because obviously when you're at you
well<00:03:53.730> at<00:03:54.030> least<00:03:54.150> our<00:03:54.329> you<00:03:54.510> haven't<00:03:54.720> got<00:03:54.810> the

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
well at least our you haven't got the

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.569 
well at least our you haven't got the
stabilizer<00:03:55.260> sort<00:03:55.950> of<00:03:56.010> learning<00:03:56.220> around

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
stabilizer sort of learning around

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.110 
stabilizer sort of learning around
grabbing<00:03:57.269> hold<00:03:57.480> of<00:03:57.630> these<00:03:58.579> undoing<00:03:59.579> the<00:03:59.760> the

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
grabbing hold of these undoing the the

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.650 
grabbing hold of these undoing the the
screw<00:04:01.160> you<00:04:02.160> know<00:04:02.280> trying<00:04:03.180> not<00:04:03.299> to<00:04:03.360> let<00:04:03.569> the

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
screw you know trying not to let the

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.360 
screw you know trying not to let the
thing<00:04:03.840> flop<00:04:04.110> down<00:04:04.319> to<00:04:04.470> unbalance<00:04:04.920> the<00:04:04.980> kayak

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
thing flop down to unbalance the kayak

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.280 
thing flop down to unbalance the kayak
so<00:04:05.640> that's<00:04:06.630> gonna<00:04:06.750> be<00:04:06.870> a<00:04:06.930> bit<00:04:07.049> of<00:04:07.140> a<00:04:07.170> learning

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
so that's gonna be a bit of a learning

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.620 
so that's gonna be a bit of a learning
curve<00:04:07.500> there<00:04:07.829> I'll<00:04:08.160> report<00:04:08.970> back<00:04:09.060> if<00:04:09.329> I<00:04:09.420> come

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
curve there I'll report back if I come

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.080 
curve there I'll report back if I come
up<00:04:09.660> with<00:04:09.840> a<00:04:09.870> technique<00:04:10.230> or<00:04:10.380> something<00:04:10.709> that

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
up with a technique or something that

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.809 
up with a technique or something that
that<00:04:12.090> um<00:04:12.390> helps<00:04:13.230> me<00:04:13.349> do<00:04:13.470> that<00:04:13.640> looks<00:04:14.640> really

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
that um helps me do that looks really

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:18.379 
that um helps me do that looks really
impressed<00:04:16.340> we've<00:04:17.340> had<00:04:17.519> quite<00:04:17.940> a<00:04:18.000> lot<00:04:18.180> of<00:04:18.269> rain

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
something so the water is very dirty I

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:25.790 
something so the water is very dirty I
went<00:04:24.210> over<00:04:24.720> that<00:04:24.780> side<00:04:25.080> there<00:04:25.350> there<00:04:25.680> was<00:04:25.770> a
