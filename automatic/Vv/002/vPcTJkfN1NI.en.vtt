would be a feature of single in 2.0 at

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:57.149 
would be a feature of single in 2.0 at
the<00:04:54.969> moment<00:04:55.330> it's<00:04:55.449> too<00:04:55.629> complicated<00:04:56.159> to

00:04:57.149 --> 00:04:57.159 
the moment it's too complicated to

the moment it's too complicated to
create<00:04:57.460> songs<00:04:57.810> having<00:04:58.810> two<00:04:58.990> shrinks<00:04:59.469> on<00:04:59.620> a

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
create songs having two shrinks on a

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.369 
create songs having two shrinks on a
such<00:05:00.460> small<00:05:00.699> device<00:05:00.999> like<00:05:01.180> the<00:05:01.270> iPhone<00:05:01.629> so<00:05:02.289> I'm

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:02.379 
such small device like the iPhone so I'm

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:03.899 
such small device like the iPhone so I'm
looking<00:05:02.620> for<00:05:02.800> new<00:05:02.919> ways<00:05:03.069> to<00:05:03.099> implement<00:05:03.490> that

00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:03.909 
looking for new ways to implement that

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:07.980 
looking for new ways to implement that
to<00:05:04.210> make<00:05:04.389> it<00:05:04.569> easier<00:05:05.139> and<00:05:06.870> but<00:05:07.870> that's

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
to make it easier and but that's

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.409 
to make it easier and but that's
hopefully<00:05:08.349> coming<00:05:08.529> with<00:05:08.740> England<00:05:09.039> 2.0<00:05:09.460> again
