00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.620 
him I mean how is what's going to happen
I<00:01:53.920> mean<00:01:54.070> is<00:01:54.280> it<00:01:54.460> a<00:01:54.490> smart<00:01:54.820> thing<00:01:55.030> to<00:01:55.090> do<00:01:55.300> to<00:01:55.450> make

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
I mean is it a smart thing to do to make

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.110 
I mean is it a smart thing to do to make
that<00:01:55.840> you<00:01:56.410> know<00:01:56.470> move<00:01:56.920> and<00:01:57.400> the<00:01:57.580> first<00:01:57.820> lap<00:01:58.090> of

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
that you know move and the first lap of

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.810 
that you know move and the first lap of
the<00:01:58.330> race<00:01:58.360> and<00:01:58.690> take<00:01:58.810> that<00:01:58.990> big<00:01:59.200> chance

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
the race and take that big chance

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.610 
the race and take that big chance
whether<00:02:00.820> it<00:02:01.060> was<00:02:01.210> smart<00:02:01.480> or<00:02:01.720> not<00:02:01.900> I<00:02:02.170> think<00:02:02.230> and

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
whether it was smart or not I think and

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.880 
whether it was smart or not I think and
I<00:02:02.650> want<00:02:02.830> to<00:02:02.920> throw<00:02:03.040> this<00:02:03.250> out<00:02:03.430> once<00:02:03.730> again
