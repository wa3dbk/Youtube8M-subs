00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:12.869 

I<00:00:09.570> think<00:00:10.570> that<00:00:10.809> what<00:00:11.200> Memorial<00:00:11.980> does<00:00:12.160> for<00:00:12.639> all

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:12.879 
I think that what Memorial does for all

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:14.520 
I think that what Memorial does for all
of<00:00:13.030> us<00:00:13.150> whether<00:00:13.510> we're<00:00:13.750> students<00:00:14.139> who<00:00:14.259> staff

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:14.530 
of us whether we're students who staff

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.440 
of us whether we're students who staff
is<00:00:15.070> it<00:00:15.990> challenges<00:00:16.990> us<00:00:17.200> to<00:00:17.590> explore

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:18.450 
is it challenges us to explore

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.120 
is it challenges us to explore
possibilities<00:00:19.480> you<00:00:20.320> found<00:00:20.619> Memorial

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.130 
possibilities you found Memorial

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.939 
possibilities you found Memorial

wonderful time the professors in

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.000 
wonderful time the professors in
mathematics<00:00:39.219> here<00:00:40.379> demanded<00:00:41.379> the<00:00:41.469> best<00:00:41.680> of<00:00:41.860> me

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
mathematics here demanded the best of me

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.510 
mathematics here demanded the best of me
as<00:00:42.309> a<00:00:42.520> student<00:00:43.090> and<00:00:44.160> everyone<00:00:45.160> here

as a student and everyone here

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.220 
as a student and everyone here
essentially<00:00:45.879> cared<00:00:46.329> a<00:00:46.450> great<00:00:46.480> deal<00:00:46.690> about<00:00:46.989> me

as<00:00:47.350> an<00:00:47.469> individual<00:00:47.890> so<00:00:47.980> I<00:00:48.129> had<00:00:48.309> a

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
as an individual so I had a

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.639 
as an individual so I had a
transformative<00:00:49.480> effect<00:00:52.379> University<00:00:53.379> I<00:00:53.440> think

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
transformative effect University I think

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:56.459 
transformative effect University I think
in<00:00:53.829> general<00:00:54.129> is<00:00:54.430> pretty<00:00:54.670> life-changing<00:00:54.940> and<00:00:55.570> I

00:00:56.459 --> 00:00:56.469 
in general is pretty life-changing and I

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:58.200 
in general is pretty life-changing and I

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
came to Grand ville College knowing

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.599 
came to Grand ville College knowing
nobody<00:00:58.449> and<00:00:58.660> now<00:00:59.289> it's<00:00:59.530> great<00:00:59.710> three<00:01:00.430> years

the<00:01:26.070> expertise<00:01:26.609> you<00:01:26.939> know<00:01:27.030> in<00:01:27.149> biology

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
the expertise you know in biology

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.459 
the expertise you know in biology
geology<00:01:27.899> and<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:28.380> on<00:01:28.549> but<00:01:29.549> on<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.759> marginal<00:01:30.469> base

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:31.469 
geology and so on but on a marginal base

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:33.800 
geology and so on but on a marginal base
I<00:01:31.500> have<00:01:32.490> access<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:33.060> university<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.539> is

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
I have access to a university that is

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.080 
I have access to a university that is
not<00:01:34.319> too<00:01:34.469> big<00:01:34.649> but<00:01:34.860> not<00:01:35.069> too<00:01:35.130> small

Faculty of Arts in the Faculty science

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.539 
Faculty of Arts in the Faculty science
are<00:01:42.810> playing<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.200> really<00:01:43.500> strong<00:01:43.859> role<00:01:44.159> in<00:01:44.189> that

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
are playing a really strong role in that

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.219 
are playing a really strong role in that
they're<00:01:44.850> there<00:01:45.420> working<00:01:45.840> with<00:01:46.079> the

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
they're there working with the

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.340 
they're there working with the
communities<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.539> government<00:01:48.539> as<00:01:48.689> well<00:01:48.869> in

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
communities and government as well in

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.419 
communities and government as well in
trying<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:50.630> not<00:01:51.630> solve<00:01:51.959> the<00:01:52.079> issue<00:01:52.200> but<00:01:53.130> I

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:53.429 
trying to not solve the issue but I

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:55.819 
trying to not solve the issue but I
think<00:01:54.079> understanding<00:01:55.079> how<00:01:55.289> climate<00:01:55.560> change

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
think understanding how climate change

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.380 
think understanding how climate change
is<00:01:56.159> going<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.429> impact<00:01:56.489> Newfoundland<00:01:57.299> and

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
is going to impact Newfoundland and

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.859 
is going to impact Newfoundland and
Labrador<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.959> how<00:01:58.619> we<00:01:58.679> should<00:01:59.599> respond<00:02:00.599> to<00:02:00.780> it

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
Labrador and how we should respond to it

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.429 
Labrador and how we should respond to it
so<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.530> key<00:02:01.799> word<00:02:02.009> is<00:02:02.310> adaptation<00:02:03.209> how<00:02:03.780> can<00:02:04.140> we

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
so the key word is adaptation how can we

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.399 
so the key word is adaptation how can we
adapt<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:05.129> this<00:02:05.939> changing<00:02:06.810> environment<00:02:06.869> to

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
adapt to this changing environment to

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.050 
adapt to this changing environment to
the<00:02:07.500> change<00:02:07.799> in<00:02:07.920> climate<00:02:10.670> you<00:02:11.670> get<00:02:11.879> to

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
the change in climate you get to

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.360 
the change in climate you get to
experience<00:02:12.690> different<00:02:12.900> cultures<00:02:13.440> all<00:02:13.950> under

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
experience different cultures all under

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.640 
experience different cultures all under
one<00:02:14.549> roof<00:02:14.819> and<00:02:15.120> being<00:02:15.780> at<00:02:15.900> Memorial<00:02:16.379> that's

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
one roof and being at Memorial that's

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.979 
one roof and being at Memorial that's
the<00:02:16.950> greatest<00:02:17.430> part<00:02:17.760> of<00:02:17.970> it<00:02:18.209> because<00:02:18.810> you<00:02:18.959> have

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
the greatest part of it because you have
