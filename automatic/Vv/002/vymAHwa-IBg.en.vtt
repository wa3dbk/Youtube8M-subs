00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
was going to be a little bit of a

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.700 
was going to be a little bit of a
struggle<00:01:29.400> up<00:01:30.390> until<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:30.930> guess<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.530> last

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
struggle up until I guess the last

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.219 
struggle up until I guess the last
practice<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.509> before<00:01:33.509> qualifying<00:01:33.780> we'd

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
practice of before qualifying we'd

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.620 
practice of before qualifying we'd
really<00:01:34.500> struggled<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.040> lot<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:36.060> guys<00:01:36.240> had<00:01:36.450> been

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
really struggled a lot the guys had been

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.600 
really struggled a lot the guys had been
up<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.110> down<00:01:37.140> with<00:01:37.259> setups<00:01:37.920> left<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.460> right

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
up and down with setups left and right

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.390 
up and down with setups left and right
all<00:01:38.850> around<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.570> nothing<00:01:40.380> really<00:01:40.619> worked<00:01:41.070> and

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
all around and nothing really worked and

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.910 
all around and nothing really worked and
last<00:01:41.729> minute<00:01:42.060> we<00:01:42.180> were<00:01:42.270> able<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:43.020> shuffle

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
last minute we were able to shuffle

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.260 
last minute we were able to shuffle
through<00:01:44.220> some<00:01:44.399> notes<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.790> make<00:01:44.909> some<00:01:45.090> things

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
through some notes and make some things

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.880 
through some notes and make some things
happen<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.810> put<00:01:46.170> everything<00:01:46.380> together<00:01:46.649> and

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
happen and put everything together and

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.490 
happen and put everything together and
ultimately<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.939> think<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.810> know<00:01:48.960> put<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.470> put

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
ultimately I think you know put it put

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.960 
ultimately I think you know put it put
together<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:50.040> pretty<00:01:50.220> good<00:01:50.430> performance

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
together a pretty good performance

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.910 
together a pretty good performance
although<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.509> wasn't<00:01:51.780> without<00:01:52.020> some<00:01:52.530> drama

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
although it wasn't without some drama

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.710 
although it wasn't without some drama
because<00:01:53.220> i<00:01:53.310> think<00:01:53.430> my<00:01:53.640> first<00:01:53.670> two<00:01:54.149> qualifying

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
because i think my first two qualifying

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.350 
because i think my first two qualifying
laps<00:01:54.990> got<00:01:55.259> taken<00:01:55.530> away<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.250> then<00:01:56.790> so<00:01:57.030> i<00:01:57.060> had<00:01:57.270> to

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
laps got taken away and then so i had to

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.230 
laps got taken away and then so i had to
try<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.719> back<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:58.049> up<00:01:58.110> with<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.350> third<00:01:58.680> one<00:01:59.240> but

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
try and back it up with a third one but

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.899 
try and back it up with a third one but
that's<00:02:00.810> part<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:01.590> know<00:02:01.710> so<00:02:01.740> it's<00:02:02.219> it's

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
that's part of it you know so it's it's

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.819 
that's part of it you know so it's it's
very<00:02:03.119> good<00:02:03.299> for<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.570> team<00:02:03.719> like<00:02:04.439> I<00:02:04.560> said<00:02:04.710> when
