about<00:04:10.820> the<00:04:10.940> mammals<00:04:11.360> well<00:04:11.840> you<00:04:11.930> might<00:04:12.140> think

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
about the mammals well you might think

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.620 
about the mammals well you might think
of<00:04:12.590> pine<00:04:12.860> marten<00:04:13.370> and<00:04:13.610> Wildcat<00:04:14.120> and<00:04:14.300> certainly

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
of pine marten and Wildcat and certainly

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.600 
of pine marten and Wildcat and certainly
they<00:04:14.870> do<00:04:14.930> occur<00:04:15.470> here<00:04:15.800> but<00:04:16.340> they're<00:04:16.489> not

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:16.610 
they do occur here but they're not

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.509 
they do occur here but they're not
dependent<00:04:17.350> directly<00:04:18.350> on<00:04:18.530> the<00:04:18.830> pine<00:04:19.040> trees<00:04:19.310> but

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
dependent directly on the pine trees but

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.220 
dependent directly on the pine trees but
there<00:04:19.640> is<00:04:19.730> a<00:04:19.760> species<00:04:20.209> that<00:04:20.239> is<00:04:20.540> and<00:04:20.840> of<00:04:21.200> course

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 
there is a species that is and of course

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.280 
there is a species that is and of course
it's<00:04:22.130> the<00:04:22.400> red<00:04:22.670> squirrel<00:04:23.300> and<00:04:23.630> they<00:04:23.930> really

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
it's the red squirrel and they really

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.280 
it's the red squirrel and they really
are<00:04:24.320> a<00:04:24.830> Scots<00:04:25.160> pine<00:04:25.490> cone<00:04:25.850> specialist<00:04:26.660> you<00:04:27.110> see

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
are a Scots pine cone specialist you see

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.080 
are a Scots pine cone specialist you see
they're<00:04:27.470> lighter<00:04:27.800> than<00:04:28.130> greys<00:04:28.400> and<00:04:28.700> as<00:04:29.060> a

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
they're lighter than greys and as a

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.150 
they're lighter than greys and as a
consequence<00:04:29.570> of<00:04:29.720> that<00:04:29.900> they<00:04:30.110> can<00:04:30.320> reach<00:04:30.560> right

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160
