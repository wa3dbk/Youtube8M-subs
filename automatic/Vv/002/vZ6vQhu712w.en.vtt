00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.520
 we have this year on this fair 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.109
 two different lenses we 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.720
 introduce and come from two completely 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.900
 different classes the one is rather 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.340
 a 4k lens with the mound and that 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.430
 others is a holder for mission 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.310
 objectively stand for two cameras here 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.489
 we now face the objective for the pl 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.710
 Mount the lenses are 25 to 300 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.010
 millimeter lens has an opening 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:42.809
 of 3.5 and has a very small 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.940
 rampling the ranking starts at 273 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.450
 millimeter and that's a whole 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.719
 small area between 273 to 300 that 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.030
 are 0.3 the numbers lost there 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.739
 go on the last piece of the bistum 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.320
 objective is relatively difficult so relative 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:02.910
 big but that's the 12x zoom 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.860
 and the lens looks effective 89 kilo 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.170
 the lens has a resolution of 4k 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.119
 and gave also very 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.409
 fantastic in the previous convertible 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.540
 a row 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.970
 The name convertible is therefore because of the 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.890
 said a convertible has its car at 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.229
 which you can drive with and without roof 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.420
 with these objective ones one can use the 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.130
 Use craft or one uses 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.510
 are not my horse the objective of 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.210
 may or without hand 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.970
 that's why we have this objectively now 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.340
 also added to the cabriolet series 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.780
 because it has now in this construction 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.880
 no handle but it will be in the future 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.229
 a handle drive what they here 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.869
 see is a prototype 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.150
 the finished object is only on 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.290
 to see the ibc and afterwards 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.630
 it also be available 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.700
 here we are now the second objectively 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.409
 we know that it is just for the news 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.060
 groups 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.409
 very interesting is not always one 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.429
 wide angle and take one 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.759
 location factor 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:57.530
 So what we see here now is one 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:59.539
 perfect mix a perfect crossing 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.240
 the lens starts with 5.5 millimeters 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:03.799
 focal length and goes in the telebereich 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.840
 up to 100 mm 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:09.560
 So it ends almost where ours 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:12.410
 Legendary 16x63 has changed in zoom 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.099
 Area the lens has a minimum 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.230
 away distance from 0 4 meters and weighs in 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:19.940
 the present version as drm 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.640
 objectively as that means it is one 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:26.450
 Built-in to mother and no focus 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.610
 mother is the 197 km with this 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.879
 objectively we already go 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.890
 step into the future because it is one 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:36.470
 our first small test balance in 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.750
 the direction 4 k the objective is not 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.269
 fourth lens it is a 2-graphics 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.160
 Deep been planned as such and 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.510
 been designed but we have 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.859
 nevertheless you try the 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.769
 to raise the resolution 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:51.470
 we are thus objectively higher 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:54.620
 in the resolution as a standard or 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.440
 has conventional hd objective to do so 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.819
 this lens is a much better one 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.150
 Contrast the pictures you get with this one 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:04.630
 Objectively, this makes a great deal of impact 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.630
 sharply
