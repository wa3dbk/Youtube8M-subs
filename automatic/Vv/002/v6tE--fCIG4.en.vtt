self besides my teacher I suppose that

book the author said I should find

book the author said I should find
solution<00:00:55.890> in<00:00:56.010> raising<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.579> chin<00:00:56.820> rest

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
solution in raising the chin rest

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.689 
solution in raising the chin rest
instead<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.109> trying<00:00:58.350> higher<00:00:58.680> shoulder<00:00:59.160> rests

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
instead of trying higher shoulder rests

instead of trying higher shoulder rests
however<00:01:00.420> raising<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.109> rest<00:01:01.410> seems<00:01:01.680> impossible

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
however raising to rest seems impossible

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.789 
however raising to rest seems impossible
because<00:01:02.640> all<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.059> finest<00:01:03.480> shop<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:03.870> visited<00:01:04.379> it

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
because all the finest shop I visited it

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.160 
because all the finest shop I visited it
refused<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.460> do<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:06.150> she's<00:01:06.360> just<00:01:06.689> me<00:01:06.960> to

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
refused to do that and she's just me to

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.100 
refused to do that and she's just me to
hire<00:01:07.380> my<00:01:07.710> shoulder<00:01:08.159> rest<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.760> they<00:01:09.600> had<00:01:09.810> no

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
hire my shoulder rest and they had no

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.710 
hire my shoulder rest and they had no
idea<00:01:10.560> about<00:01:10.710> raising<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.520> chin<00:01:11.820> rest<00:01:12.030> my

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
idea about raising the chin rest my

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.380 
idea about raising the chin rest my
teacher<00:01:13.020> thinks<00:01:13.560> that<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:13.740> could<00:01:14.159> use<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:15.000> shower

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
teacher thinks that I could use a shower

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.600 
teacher thinks that I could use a shower
towel<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.229> handkerchief<00:01:16.710> but<00:01:16.979> they<00:01:17.159> just

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
towel of a handkerchief but they just

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.820 
towel of a handkerchief but they just
ease<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.909> problem<00:01:18.659> rather<00:01:18.960> than<00:01:19.259> solving<00:01:19.710> it

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
ease the problem rather than solving it

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.960 
ease the problem rather than solving it
completely<00:01:20.369> I<00:01:20.549> think<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.810> problem<00:01:22.170> is

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
completely I think that the problem is

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.870 
completely I think that the problem is
its<00:01:23.970> I<00:01:24.150> think<00:01:24.420> it's<00:01:24.540> my<00:01:24.689> major<00:01:25.670> problem<00:01:26.670> cause

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
its I think it's my major problem cause

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.030 
its I think it's my major problem cause
in<00:01:27.030> many<00:01:27.240> other<00:01:27.479> minor<00:01:27.840> effects<00:01:28.500> when<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.740> play

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
in many other minor effects when I play

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.800 
in many other minor effects when I play
my<00:01:29.280> right<00:01:29.490> shoulder<00:01:29.790> holding<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.509> bow<00:01:30.630> just

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
my right shoulder holding the bow just

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.990 
my right shoulder holding the bow just
keeps<00:01:31.110> rising<00:01:31.320> up<00:01:31.650> making<00:01:31.890> me<00:01:32.159> feel<00:01:32.310> tired<00:01:32.670> of

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
keeps rising up making me feel tired of

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.030 
keeps rising up making me feel tired of
the<00:01:33.119> shoulder<00:01:33.540> for<00:01:34.200> now<00:01:34.320> I'm<00:01:34.530> trying<00:01:34.890> to

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
the shoulder for now I'm trying to

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.950 
the shoulder for now I'm trying to
balance<00:01:35.220> my<00:01:35.579> way<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:35.970> playing<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.689> think

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
balance my way of playing and I think

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.690 
balance my way of playing and I think
that<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.229> could<00:01:37.409> suggest<00:01:37.619> me<00:01:37.979> some<00:01:38.009> solutions

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
that you could suggest me some solutions

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.069 
that you could suggest me some solutions
let's<00:01:39.030> hope<00:01:39.180> so

with<00:02:11.489> it<00:02:11.700> certainly<00:02:12.180> if<00:02:12.390> they<00:02:12.629> are<00:02:12.690> too

or if they have a long neck or both what
you<00:02:17.170> heard<00:02:17.380> and<00:02:17.560> financial<00:02:18.400> is<00:02:19.020> sorry<00:02:20.020> to<00:02:20.200> say

that<00:02:20.410> but<00:02:20.620> it's<00:02:20.950> not<00:02:21.220> true

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
that but it's not true

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.960 
that but it's not true
probably<00:02:22.780> they<00:02:22.930> just<00:02:23.260> say<00:02:23.530> that<00:02:23.710> because<00:02:23.970> most

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
probably they just say that because most

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.390 
probably they just say that because most
common<00:02:25.660> shopper<00:02:26.050> vests<00:02:26.440> you<00:02:26.560> can<00:02:26.800> easily

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
common shopper vests you can easily

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.210 
common shopper vests you can easily
adjust<00:02:27.580> in<00:02:28.060> Heights<00:02:28.300> but<00:02:29.080> a<00:02:29.320> chin<00:02:29.740> rest<00:02:29.950> is

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
adjust in Heights but a chin rest is

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.740 
adjust in Heights but a chin rest is
just<00:02:30.280> one<00:02:31.030> wooden<00:02:31.810> thing<00:02:32.170> that<00:02:33.210> you<00:02:34.210> can<00:02:34.450> pick

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
just one wooden thing that you can pick

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.110 
just one wooden thing that you can pick
one<00:02:35.020> out<00:02:35.050> but<00:02:35.770> after<00:02:36.040> that<00:02:36.490> it's<00:02:36.850> not

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
one out but after that it's not

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.020 
one out but after that it's not
adjustable<00:02:37.780> in<00:02:38.110> height<00:02:38.140> so<00:02:39.130> I<00:02:39.160> think<00:02:39.370> they<00:02:39.880> are

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
adjustable in height so I think they are

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.730 
adjustable in height so I think they are

so<00:04:06.190> that's<00:04:06.340> in<00:04:06.670> another<00:04:07.030> video<00:04:07.330> because<00:04:07.690> I

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
so that's in another video because I

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.380 
so that's in another video because I
think<00:04:08.040> playing<00:04:09.040> with<00:04:09.250> shield<00:04:09.549> rest<00:04:09.760> myself<00:04:09.970> I

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
think playing with shield rest myself I

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.630 
think playing with shield rest myself I
am<00:04:11.019> NOT<00:04:11.079> a<00:04:11.290> person<00:04:11.530> to<00:04:11.709> explain<00:04:12.130> someone<00:04:12.489> else

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
am NOT a person to explain someone else

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.990 
am NOT a person to explain someone else
to<00:04:12.760> play<00:04:12.910> without<00:04:13.110> perfect<00:04:14.110> eye<00:04:14.440> I<00:04:15.340> hope<00:04:15.820> you

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
to play without perfect eye I hope you

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.500 
to play without perfect eye I hope you
understand<00:04:16.690> that<00:04:17.280> but<00:04:18.280> as<00:04:18.519> opposed<00:04:19.150> to<00:04:19.359> the

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
understand that but as opposed to the

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.650 
understand that but as opposed to the
chin<00:04:19.840> rest<00:04:20.049> and<00:04:21.060> the<00:04:22.060> height<00:04:22.240> what<00:04:23.020> you<00:04:23.169> can

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
chin rest and the height what you can

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.640 
chin rest and the height what you can
what<00:04:25.660> the<00:04:25.780> problem<00:04:26.229> is

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
what the problem is

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.830 
what the problem is
is<00:04:26.740> if<00:04:27.100> you<00:04:27.310> make<00:04:27.699> your<00:04:27.940> shoulders<00:04:28.240> higher<00:04:28.540> and

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
is if you make your shoulders higher and

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.870 
is if you make your shoulders higher and
higher<00:04:29.020> the<00:04:29.350> first<00:04:29.949> thing<00:04:30.250> that<00:04:30.280> happens<00:04:30.699> is

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
higher the first thing that happens is

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.990 
higher the first thing that happens is
that<00:04:31.090> the<00:04:31.180> fining<00:04:31.690> goes<00:04:31.990> up<00:04:32.370> and<00:04:33.370> that's<00:04:33.699> not

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
that the fining goes up and that's not

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.950 
that the fining goes up and that's not
what<00:04:34.389> we<00:04:34.570> want

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
what we want

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.529 
what we want
because<00:04:35.229> if<00:04:35.410> violin<00:04:35.919> is<00:04:36.070> higher<00:04:36.280> then<00:04:36.970> your

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
because if violin is higher then your

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:40.230 
because if violin is higher then your
bow<00:04:37.870> arm<00:04:38.169> must<00:04:38.470> be<00:04:38.650> higher<00:04:38.889> too<00:04:39.580> and<00:04:39.880> that's

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
bow arm must be higher too and that's

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.270 
bow arm must be higher too and that's
why<00:04:40.630> you<00:04:40.930> have<00:04:41.440> to<00:04:41.590> raise<00:04:41.830> your<00:04:42.070> right

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
why you have to raise your right

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.460 
why you have to raise your right
shoulder<00:04:42.789> to<00:04:43.150> get<00:04:43.360> to<00:04:43.539> the<00:04:43.660> violin<00:04:44.139> that<00:04:44.320> it's

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
shoulder to get to the violin that it's

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.640 
shoulder to get to the violin that it's
too<00:04:44.680> high<00:04:44.889> and<00:04:45.220> then<00:04:45.880> you<00:04:46.180> get<00:04:46.449> pain<00:04:47.259> in<00:04:47.530> your

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
too high and then you get pain in your

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.040 
too high and then you get pain in your
shoulder<00:04:48.130> and<00:04:48.370> it<00:04:48.610> gets<00:04:48.850> tired<00:04:49.120> and<00:04:49.509> well

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
shoulder and it gets tired and well

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.499 
shoulder and it gets tired and well
tired<00:04:50.410> is<00:04:50.710> least<00:04:50.979> of<00:04:51.130> your<00:04:51.250> problems<00:04:51.310> you<00:04:52.300> can

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:52.509 
tired is least of your problems you can

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:56.330 
tired is least of your problems you can
get<00:04:52.660> some<00:04:52.870> injury<00:04:53.910> from<00:04:54.910> it<00:04:55.120> too<00:04:55.330> so<00:04:55.630> don't

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
get some injury from it too so don't

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.710 
get some injury from it too so don't
make<00:04:57.340> your<00:04:57.550> shoulder<00:04:58.000> rest<00:04:58.150> higher<00:04:58.449> and

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
make your shoulder rest higher and

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.480 
make your shoulder rest higher and
higher<00:04:58.900> and<00:04:59.169> higher<00:04:59.260> instead<00:04:59.949> of<00:05:00.070> that<00:05:00.280> you

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
higher and higher instead of that you

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.860 
higher and higher instead of that you
can<00:05:01.650> put<00:05:02.650> some<00:05:02.919> something<00:05:03.400> if<00:05:03.789> you<00:05:04.000> make<00:05:04.630> these

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
can put some something if you make these

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.219 
can put some something if you make these
screws<00:05:05.229> loose<00:05:06.120> you<00:05:07.120> can<00:05:07.300> put<00:05:07.449> something<00:05:07.720> here

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229 
screws loose you can put something here

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:10.680 
screws loose you can put something here
in<00:05:08.530> between<00:05:09.160> the<00:05:09.370> violin<00:05:09.850> and<00:05:10.030> chin<00:05:10.330> rest<00:05:10.539> or

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
in between the violin and chin rest or

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.730 
in between the violin and chin rest or
you<00:05:10.750> can<00:05:10.930> make<00:05:11.050> it<00:05:11.080> just<00:05:11.560> a<00:05:11.680> little<00:05:11.949> bit<00:05:12.630> higher

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
you can make it just a little bit higher

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.839 
you can make it just a little bit higher
you<00:05:14.740> can<00:05:15.460> do<00:05:15.729> that<00:05:15.940> with<00:05:16.270> for<00:05:16.630> example<00:05:16.690> some

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:17.849 
you can do that with for example some

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:18.960 
you can do that with for example some
quark

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
quark

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.189 
quark
I<00:05:19.000> think<00:05:19.300> it's<00:05:19.449> gold<00:05:19.750> from<00:05:20.410> a<00:05:20.500> wine<00:05:20.680> bottle<00:05:20.889> and

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 
I think it's gold from a wine bottle and

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:25.650 
I think it's gold from a wine bottle and
so<00:05:23.199> you<00:05:23.260> can<00:05:23.530> make<00:05:23.710> your<00:05:24.340> own<00:05:24.370> chin<00:05:25.270> rest<00:05:25.509> a

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
so you can make your own chin rest a

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:26.879 
so you can make your own chin rest a
little<00:05:25.840> bit<00:05:26.020> higher<00:05:26.169> and<00:05:26.440> searching<00:05:26.860> the

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:26.889 
little bit higher and searching the

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:28.950 
little bit higher and searching the
internet<00:05:26.979> for<00:05:27.430> higher<00:05:27.880> chin<00:05:28.270> rest<00:05:28.479> and<00:05:28.690> just

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
internet for higher chin rest and just

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.439 
internet for higher chin rest and just
order<00:05:29.380> the<00:05:29.740> chin<00:05:29.949> rest<00:05:30.099> that<00:05:30.280> you<00:05:30.430> have<00:05:30.669> but

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:31.449 
order the chin rest that you have but

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:34.650 
order the chin rest that you have but
then<00:05:31.660> in<00:05:31.900> a<00:05:32.050> higher<00:05:32.430> version<00:05:33.430> because<00:05:34.240> if<00:05:34.510> you

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.660 
then in a higher version because if you

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.730 
then in a higher version because if you
make<00:05:34.840> your<00:05:34.990> chin<00:05:35.289> rest<00:05:35.560> higher<00:05:35.919> then<00:05:37.500> you<00:05:38.500> have

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
make your chin rest higher then you have

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.909 
make your chin rest higher then you have
here<00:05:39.010> more<00:05:39.639> space<00:05:40.510> filled<00:05:40.900> up<00:05:41.110> and<00:05:41.320> at<00:05:41.830> the

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 
here more space filled up and at the

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:44.310 
here more space filled up and at the
same<00:05:41.949> time<00:05:42.430> your<00:05:42.699> violin<00:05:43.150> will<00:05:43.389> be<00:05:43.570> in<00:05:43.810> the

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 
same time your violin will be in the

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.540 
same time your violin will be in the
same<00:05:44.590> position

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
same position

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.939 
same position
so<00:05:45.820> I<00:05:45.849> think<00:05:46.330> you<00:05:46.479> definitely<00:05:47.139> need<00:05:47.680> to<00:05:47.710> look

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:47.949 
so I think you definitely need to look

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:51.779 
so I think you definitely need to look
for<00:05:48.190> chin<00:05:48.400> rest<00:05:48.930> if<00:05:50.099> you<00:05:51.099> haven't<00:05:51.580> found

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:51.789 
for chin rest if you haven't found

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:54.000 
for chin rest if you haven't found
higher<00:05:52.300> chin<00:05:52.690> rest<00:05:52.960> or<00:05:53.199> they<00:05:53.620> are<00:05:53.800> too

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010 
higher chin rest or they are too

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.060 
higher chin rest or they are too
expensive<00:05:54.460> then<00:05:55.150> maybe<00:05:55.510> you<00:05:55.870> can<00:05:56.139> ask<00:05:56.349> someone

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.070 
expensive then maybe you can ask someone

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:59.250 
expensive then maybe you can ask someone
who<00:05:57.460> is<00:05:57.580> handy<00:05:58.000> with<00:05:58.150> wood<00:05:58.360> carving<00:05:58.840> to<00:05:58.960> create

00:05:59.250 --> 00:05:59.260 
who is handy with wood carving to create

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.060 
who is handy with wood carving to create
a<00:05:59.289> chin<00:05:59.650> rest<00:06:00.419> for<00:06:01.419> you<00:06:01.720> so<00:06:02.349> you<00:06:02.440> can<00:06:02.710> have<00:06:02.889> it

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.070 
a chin rest for you so you can have it

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:07.040 
a chin rest for you so you can have it
made<00:06:03.699> perhaps<00:06:04.330> I<00:06:04.630> hope<00:06:05.349> this<00:06:05.560> will<00:06:06.159> help<00:06:06.220> you

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
made perhaps I hope this will help you

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.379 
made perhaps I hope this will help you
I've<00:06:08.050> seen<00:06:08.500> several<00:06:08.740> people<00:06:09.039> with<00:06:09.340> the<00:06:10.150> same

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:10.389 
I've seen several people with the same

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:12.719 
I've seen several people with the same
problem<00:06:10.870> and<00:06:10.990> then<00:06:11.199> the<00:06:11.889> only<00:06:12.070> solution<00:06:12.190> is

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:12.729 
problem and then the only solution is
