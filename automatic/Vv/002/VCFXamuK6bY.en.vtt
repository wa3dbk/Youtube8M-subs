 Luis would have found another way of working with 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.800
 his illustrations he made infographics those drawings that 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.530
 appear in magazines and newspapers 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.100

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.970
 gradually transformed the world of illustrations 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:32.469
 irony of destiny 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:36.809
