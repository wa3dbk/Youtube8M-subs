00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:10.744
 The game you are currently seeing is called True Crime New York City 

00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:13.226
 Released in 2005 and many do not know it, 

00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:15.848
 But this game is part of a series called True Crime 

00:00:15.848 --> 00:00:19.119
 And this not-so-familiar set of games opened an option 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.082
 One of the best open-world gang games ever 

00:00:22.242 --> 00:00:24.312
 And is now called Sleeping Dogs. 

00:00:35.985 --> 00:00:39.583
 You see, the next True Crime game was supposed to take place in Hong Kong, 

00:00:39.583 --> 00:00:41.300
 And it started its development by Activision, 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.788
 But because development took too much time and money for the game to be canceled, 

00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:46.205
 At least that's what we thought. 

00:00:46.425 --> 00:00:49.638
 A few months later we were told that Square Enix had bought the brand, 

00:00:49.638 --> 00:00:52.181
 And it will let United Front Games develop the game, 

00:00:52.181 --> 00:00:54.201
 Without any connection to True Crime games. 

00:00:57.905 --> 00:00:58.911
 And now for the game itself, 

00:00:58.911 --> 00:01:01.639
 The plot of the campaign tells of a policeman named Wei Shen, 

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:03.924
 Who grew up in Hong Kong and was associated with characters in his childhood 

00:01:03.924 --> 00:01:06.328
 Who as a policeman are the heads of gangs and the like ... 

00:01:06.848 --> 00:01:09.052
 When Wei Shen is suspended as a cop in America 

00:01:09.052 --> 00:01:13.232
 He returns to the place of his maturity, and he goes deep into the gangs of Hong Kong as an undercover cop. 

00:01:20.252 --> 00:01:23.385
 The purpose of Wei's work is to bring down the organized crime industry 

00:01:23.385 --> 00:01:25.364
 The largest known as the Sun On Yee, 

00:01:25.614 --> 00:01:28.648
 And basically clean the city of all the crime caused by the gang. 

00:01:29.168 --> 00:01:32.775
 During his work, it is surprising to see how Wei was associated with most of the people with whom he was in the gang 

00:01:32.775 --> 00:01:35.058
 As one of his childhood friends called Jackie, 

00:01:35.058 --> 00:01:39.318
 And how the gang manages to change Wei's approach when he sees the side of the criminals. 

00:01:46.644 --> 00:01:49.544
 The plot becomes entangled when Wei gradually progresses in rank 

00:01:49.544 --> 00:01:51.351
 Until he reaches the people who control the gang 

00:01:51.351 --> 00:01:56.251
 And he was caught up in a war with a rival gang called the 18K and forced to help his friends and his party 

00:01:56.251 --> 00:01:57.931
 While preserving his secret identity. 

00:02:03.103 --> 00:02:06.148
 During the game Wei will meet people who are alleged to be criminals 

00:02:06.148 --> 00:02:09.192
 That he should stop but as he progresses the plot he will connect to them 

00:02:09.192 --> 00:02:11.513
 And will experience a difficult situation physically and mentally, 

00:02:11.903 --> 00:02:14.385
 In addition Wei will blur the boundaries between what is good and what is bad 

00:02:14.385 --> 00:02:17.209
 While addressing the dilemma of whether to impose justice in the city 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.049
 Or to avenge his sister's murder committed by one of his adversaries. 

00:02:31.442 --> 00:02:34.811
 The course of the game takes place in an open world entirely built by in-depth studies 

00:02:34.811 --> 00:02:36.263
 Of Hong Kong nightlife 

00:02:36.263 --> 00:02:39.516
 And a heavy attitude to the city's stores and the many Neon signs of the region. 

00:02:39.916 --> 00:02:43.404
 It's a pity to see that if you progress towards some of the shops of the game map 

00:02:43.404 --> 00:02:46.614
 You'll find poor-quality textures that take off the quality of the open world. 

00:02:52.013 --> 00:02:55.120
 The campaign's tasks were expressed in an excellent way in my opinion, 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.256
 The game puts you straight into the action, and does not progress slowly in the plot 

00:02:58.256 --> 00:03:00.112
 Like many other open world games. 

00:03:00.612 --> 00:03:04.141
 Each task contributes to the plot of the game whether it is the main plot or the side plot 

00:03:04.141 --> 00:03:07.119
 Where Wei resolves other police uniforms in the city. 

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:10.351
 The missions also provide constant action when some of them set you up 

00:03:10.351 --> 00:03:13.801
 Quick pursuit, hostage situation, and glorious Kung Fu battles. 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.564
 And by the way Kung Fu fights, the battle system in Sleeping Dogs 

00:03:21.564 --> 00:03:24.092
 Is one of the most powerful aspects of the game, 

00:03:24.092 --> 00:03:27.346
 Because even there, the system has been inspired by the latest Batman games 

00:03:27.346 --> 00:03:31.107
 Like a lot of other games. The Battle System gives you the possibility to hit, 

00:03:31.107 --> 00:03:35.010
 Kick and block opponents' attacks, but one of the most fun things in fights 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.060
 They use the environment to your advantage as cruel ending moves. 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.922
 And after all these deliveries, it's too bad to say that the most disappointing part of the game 

00:03:48.922 --> 00:03:53.385
 Is actually the use of weapons, and this is because first thing there are not many weapons in the game, 

00:03:53.385 --> 00:03:56.688
 That is, there are knives, machete and only two types of guns and warm weapons, 

00:03:56.688 --> 00:03:58.579
 Which feels as though there is no diversity at all. 

00:03:58.899 --> 00:04:03.419
 The second thing is that the transition between shelter and intentions is very problematic and uncomfortable at all, which is a shame. 

00:04:11.513 --> 00:04:14.132
 In my opinion, the creators of the game tried to think of a way to connect 

00:04:14.132 --> 00:04:17.915
 Among all the means that make a simple open world game a successful action game, 

00:04:18.065 --> 00:04:20.149
 And that's why they put into play an enjoyable battle system, 

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:22.963
 Use of weapons although it was not as successful as they wanted 

00:04:22.963 --> 00:04:26.261
 And a strong use of parkour as a means in missions and foot pursuits, 

00:04:26.261 --> 00:04:29.411
 In addition to everything, they also brought us a very comfortable driving system. 

00:04:37.268 --> 00:04:40.350
 It's a shame to see that some of the things were not as successful as they wanted, 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.146
 But after all, it does not mean that Sleeping Dogs is a bad game, 

00:04:43.146 --> 00:04:45.347
 Is just the opposite just that it is not perfect. 

00:04:45.347 --> 00:04:48.074
 But wait, is this all Sleeping Dogs has to offer? 

00:04:48.234 --> 00:04:51.612
 So this is not, that is, really after the campaign there is not much to do, 

00:04:51.612 --> 00:04:56.220
 But there are about 4 more game openings that give fascinating directions to Wei Shen's exploits, 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.940
 Some of them stupid and some of them taking ideas 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.610
 Culture and the news of Hong Kong and are reflected in the additions. 

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:11.878
 Finally, I say that for those who do not know, there will be a continuation of Sleeping Dogs 

00:05:11.878 --> 00:05:14.647
 And was first announced in October 2013, 

00:05:14.647 --> 00:05:18.069
 When United Front Games confirmed that the next game would be called Triad Wars 

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:21.160
 And it will still take place in the Forum of Sleeping Dogs and I will be happy to inform you 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.340
 When there is a serious announcement on the matter. 

00:05:29.258 --> 00:05:30.923
 So this is the coverage for Sleeping Dogs, 

00:05:30.923 --> 00:05:32.696
