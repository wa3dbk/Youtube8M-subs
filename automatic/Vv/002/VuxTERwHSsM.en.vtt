00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
that if you don't have one that you

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.429 
that if you don't have one that you
would<00:01:44.970> get<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:46.729> screw<00:01:47.729> centering<00:01:48.240> drill<00:01:49.229> bit

working place or hardware store but that

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.640 
working place or hardware store but that
otherwise<00:01:57.030> went<00:01:57.300> together<00:01:57.420> quite<00:01:58.350> nice

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
otherwise went together quite nice

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.240 
otherwise went together quite nice
actually<00:01:59.520> find<00:02:00.120> the<00:02:00.360> neck<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.020> be<00:02:01.530> quite

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
actually find the neck to be quite

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.160 
actually find the neck to be quite
playable<00:02:02.700> there<00:02:03.390> are<00:02:03.510> a<00:02:03.540> couple<00:02:03.600> of<00:02:03.870> frets

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
playable there are a couple of frets

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.270 
playable there are a couple of frets
that<00:02:04.650> are<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.340> little<00:02:05.640> bit<00:02:05.940> high<00:02:06.180> so<00:02:06.750> again<00:02:07.560> part

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
that are a little bit high so again part

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.620 
that are a little bit high so again part
of<00:02:08.429> learning<00:02:08.610> process<00:02:09.360> as<00:02:09.780> I'm<00:02:10.110> going<00:02:10.500> to

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
of learning process as I'm going to

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.900 
of learning process as I'm going to
tweak<00:02:12.630> those<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:15.410> you<00:02:16.410> know<00:02:16.470> get<00:02:17.370> rid<00:02:17.580> of<00:02:17.610> the

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
tweak those and you know get rid of the

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.820 
tweak those and you know get rid of the
plaza<00:02:18.420> from<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.050> frets<00:02:19.320> that<00:02:19.440> are<00:02:19.680> a<00:02:19.710> little

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
plaza from the frets that are a little

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.130 
plaza from the frets that are a little
high<00:02:20.150> but<00:02:21.150> otherwise<00:02:21.570> give<00:02:21.900> you<00:02:21.990> a<00:02:22.020> little

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
high but otherwise give you a little

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.970 
high but otherwise give you a little
example<00:02:22.320> and<00:02:23.210> again<00:02:24.210> I<00:02:24.300> have<00:02:24.770> played<00:02:25.770> much

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
example and again I have played much

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.240 
example and again I have played much
guitar<00:02:26.400> in<00:02:26.580> about<00:02:26.820> 30<00:02:27.150> some<00:02:27.450> years<00:02:27.480> so<00:02:28.250> it's

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
guitar in about 30 some years so it's

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.070 
guitar in about 30 some years so it's
kind<00:02:29.459> of<00:02:29.490> a<00:02:29.580> learning<00:02:29.730> process<00:02:30.150> for<00:02:30.450> me<00:02:30.750> as

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
kind of a learning process for me as

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.440 
kind of a learning process for me as
