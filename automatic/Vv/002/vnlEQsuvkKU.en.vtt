 prepared well this is the food that I 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.710
 preparation truth can be variable but 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.970
 this is the food that has 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:19.010
 this is the food we use 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:22.640
 what is this that we have here previously 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:26.060
 the mills all this kind of food the 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:29.710
 mills to use it here in this fret 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:33.610
 they think we're going to prepare a lot 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.530
 because from here we're going to give the 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.230
 years that are pre care also apart 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.720
 of those in town 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.900
 what we do here we have to 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:47.900
 soak 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:51.210
 until you have the water at the level of 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:54.030
 food after we move it 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.870
 so that this food is well integrated 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:03.870
 apart from what is this other we put you 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:08.250
 about 200 grams of food from 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:13.960
 dog for the protein we put food 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:15.420
 of dog and we added it with 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.560
 is 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.340
 it is called 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:25.040
 the cod liver is some years 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:28.340
 caliber today is the same no more in English 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.180
 they are given more or less what are some 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.180
 two spoons 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:39.190
 hole gauge 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:44.479
 or cod liver and we do that 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:47.900
 it penetrates well that it mixes well all 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:51.340
 the food because when we leave it 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:54.080
 rest minimum we leave a half hour 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.320
 half an hour an hour 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.540
 so that everything is integrated because after 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.260
 Here we are going to add the fruit that 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.850
 We can add 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:09.600
 the banana we can add apple papaya 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.810
 peach several types of fruit if it is a 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.520
 single fruit per day a single type of fruit 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.100
 that we are going to give to the 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:21.660
 animals and also for potassium 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:24.060
 we are going to give to give dad who is from 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.100
 computation we're going to grate on this 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.190
 shape 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.230
 so that it is integrated we are going to prepare the 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.600
 food for the roosters 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.780
 This is the food when they go to sleep and 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.300
 the damage and it's already the time behind the 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.580
 burladero 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:44.100
 the time to rest 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.150
 so this is really a paca for 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.150
 the big afternoon 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.040
 but 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:59.659
 also orange soaking for orange 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.010
 and this displaces we are also 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:06.650
 gives 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:09.379
 chopped the banana and there as they see it there 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.020
 there's the striped papaya, you just have to 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:14.660
 integrate it so that it is 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:18.069
 attached to all the food that does not go to 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.060
 eat pure potatoes or not eat 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.400
 pure grain 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.709
 this great work of pea and corn 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.170
 palomero 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:34.040
 yellow and barley 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:39.439
 for wheat sorghum oats there are enough 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:41.739
 enough grains and 38 rites that 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:41.739
 we call 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:49.120
 add with proteins with energy 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.750
 since we have all 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.910
 well integrated 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:58.800
 as we are seeing here and the Pope does not 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:04:03.270
 it's going to rust because this community 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:06.960
 then the animals are going to eat it 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:08.850
 Well with much desire with enough 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.090
 you win after we've finished it 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:16.380
 prepare that we throw the oil of 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:20.130
 cod liver we want the potato or 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:23.940
 fruit in your case you have to give them as they 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:26.130
 I say a fruit in the morning and a route 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.680
 in the afternoon anyone should not be the 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.960
 same fruit a day even they do not have 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.110
 what to give them in the morning and in the afternoon I 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:37.380
 I give them nothing more once a day once 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:42.270

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:44.460
 Daddy, then I give them carrots and that's how 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.250
 I got to know about how lettuce from 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:50.190
 method then other types of vegetables 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.810
 and the rooster love them and apart that the 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.320
 carotene is very useful for carrots 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:57.480
 for the vitamin a vitamin d they have 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.600

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:09.150
 we give them to do this is in the 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:13.470

 also the same in the pre-city are given 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:26.520
 after the medicine we put this 

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:28.170
 and this is carried by all the roosters 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.880
 eat those who are in the pre-care 

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:31.440
 even that they are in which right now like 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.710
 stella is already waiting for his 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.470
 food 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:38.990
 We are waiting and so here he will have 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:43.400
 to wait a little while in whatever 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:45.860
 integrates all the vitamins the fruit what 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:48.530
 that the potato is right now and all this is going to 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:50.740
 change will change its appearance when 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:50.740
 they 

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:55.370
 will change the appearance will no longer be enough 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:58.040
 well and it's going to help a lot in the humidity 

00:06:55.370 --> 00:07:00.580
 of the cock because although we give them the 

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:03.380
 Water does not consume so much water after 

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:07.449
 this food because it takes a lot 

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:10.840
 humidity so the cock is never dry 

00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:13.689
 these are nothing more than 15 days what 

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.789
 we give 18 days after the last 

00:07:13.689 --> 00:07:18.339
 three days they were given eat a meal 

00:07:15.789 --> 00:07:21.089
 very different that is the community that 

00:07:18.339 --> 00:07:23.439
 we call of pluto to pluck the rooster 

00:07:21.089 --> 00:07:26.320
 and this is the food that right now 

00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:29.590
 let's serve these guys 

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:31.000
 since it is integrated while it is here 

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:32.890
 I'm going to bring the roosters to be able 

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.860
 attract them and they know that here is 

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:39.120
 they were only going to come flying for him and 

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:39.120
 now we are going to show you
