00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 hello first thing i use two 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.900
 tonal creams mixing them together 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:13.889
 to get the shade I need further 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.080
 feather it all brush the same 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.840
 comes from proofreaders one more 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.520
 yellow another more gray i get 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.400
 perfect shade for me and 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.210
 perfect texture to destroy all 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.210
 problem areas 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:35.610
 the next step is to collectors of pallets 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.310
 Zoya you or I will do the correction 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.630
 to get more dense more 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.630
 stand shade 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:52.360
 further very well shaded to 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.360
 there was a smooth transition from color to color 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.910
 further i use translucent powder 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.910
 for fixing cream textures 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.890
 until five minutes later I will clean 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:17.260
 for the right i use fudge from 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.260
 anastasia beverly hills in crowd color 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.300

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.210
 tape glued lower eyelid 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.460
 direction to the brows so our smokes 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.810
 turned out very clear and you did not go 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:37.460
 where we do not need the first shade 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:40.250
 caramel next goes dark brown 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:47.020
 I put all this on the crease of the rolling 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:50.259
 century to very well shade the color 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:53.060

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.020
 brick brown on our top 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.200
 on a haze to make it very beautiful 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.200
 gradient 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:25.160

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.900
 Smokey 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:41.170

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:43.590
