00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.660
 which we love some people 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.849
 among you they will try to kill me after the 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.710
 statement that I'm about to do but oh well 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.389
 I tell you 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.880
 he admits that he never understood a chip 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:19.529
 lippa on the robot series that more 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:22.350
 famous in japan which is gandan or like 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.779
 it is often said in Italy until today 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:29.420
 this because I had the opportunity to 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.529
 see the movie mobile suit gundam no 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.380
 this because I had the opportunity to 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:38.910
 see the movie mobile suit gundam the 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:41.040
 origin and was totally different from 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.710
 what I expected to see maybe 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.660
 I speak from profane but being born in 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.780
 an age different from that of the first 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.739
 series of campaigns of the bang of all 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.879
 Japanese plans I never have 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.210
 had particular curiosity in the 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.890
 recover 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.980
 also because I suspect my double 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.680
 chromosome hicks and had kept away 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.180
 from all that was the genus of 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.540
 robot laser fights for 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.790
 get closer to the series 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:18.390
 resident cosev agents sam straw e 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.240
 by those, however, there was something at the bottom 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.520
 after all, he said maybe you should 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.850
 learn more about this people 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.150
 Japanese is so passionate about this 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.659
 earth to build a statue of one 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.430
 and to place it right there in odaiba 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.619
 maybe it's really worth it 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.380
 I jumped at the chance because 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.090
 this film is exactly the prequel of 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.149
 all that is the cannes series 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.640
 dame and here I say it and here I swear this 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.680
 movie made me think again about all the 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.450
 prejudices I had on the series of 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.960
 robottoni and on the gundam series 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.100
 in fact I swear I absolutely want you 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.900
 the second part 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.020
 does not exist I want the second part 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:05.860
 now the story starts with super 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:08.830
 battle the udur special effects and the 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.890
 roses here you see I did not know just button 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.680
 seen small and instead not because then it goes 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.830
 all transformed completely different 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.420
 political intrigues and families that if 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.420
 they make it all the colors because 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.380
 they want to reach power and legal 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:29.769
 of the protagonist 's family e 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.840
 murders really there are all of them 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.970
 the colors the plot is so rich that not 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.190
 never makes you lose focus and 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.130
 even if they do not give details 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.280
 technical explanations on what 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.050
 history because in any case it is dystopian world 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.170
 so judge what happened 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.489
 because we are not on earth it is normal 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.530
 after 15 minutes 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.600
 you know what the picture is 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.580
 general situation the design style 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.799
 then resumes that of the classic series 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.350
 of canda revised perhaps in key more 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.910
 modern that you may like or dislike 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.470
 I really liked it 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.630
 it must be said that I am a person who 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.820
 look much more at the plot than at the 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.430
 graphics of an animated film or a 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:13.329
 any anime then with this video 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:15.400
 and I want to apologize to the series of 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.140
 cannes dame and swears that the next 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.900
 once you sail or cordera that 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.120
 giant statue with different eyes 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.359
 weather permitting maybe I'll even succeed 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:28.420
 recover the souls nothing I have mine 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:30.970
 excuses I made the video ends here and 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.680
 but obviously they can go away money 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.140
 empty-handed in Africa in description 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.269
 find the always the legendary coupon 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.209
 the one to get the discount at the cinema 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:42.760
 Tuesday 23 and Wednesday 24 June together 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:45.010
 to the site where to see the list of cinemas 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.650
 that will project him as usual to me 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.130
 I recommend if you've already seen it if you are 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.019
 fan 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.030

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.470
 seen leave me a comment and tell me if 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.600
 you agree with what I said 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.860
 is 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.460
 nothing then we see each other 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.650
 video already in this video I shot it 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:04.260
 with the gopro because it will be the practice 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.560
 important news on the channel so it goes 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.560
 well
