00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
hit at least 4 40 on the squad that

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.510 
hit at least 4 40 on the squad that
would<00:01:42.630> put<00:01:42.810> me<00:01:42.869> 15<00:01:43.409> pounds<00:01:43.860> heavier<00:01:44.189> than<00:01:44.399> my

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
would put me 15 pounds heavier than my

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.090 
would put me 15 pounds heavier than my
last<00:01:44.729> squat<00:01:45.180> on<00:01:45.210> my<00:01:45.360> last<00:01:45.570> meet<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:46.020> 425<00:01:46.799> pounds

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
last squat on my last meet of 425 pounds

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.800 
last squat on my last meet of 425 pounds
and<00:01:49.220> bench<00:01:50.220> I'm<00:01:50.549> thinking<00:01:51.030> anywhere<00:01:51.600> between

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
and bench I'm thinking anywhere between

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.810 
and bench I'm thinking anywhere between
3<00:01:52.619> 30<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.340> 34<00:01:53.880> t<00:01:54.560> let<00:01:55.560> max<00:01:55.799> that<00:01:56.009> in<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.189> while<00:01:56.399> so

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
3 30 and 34 t let max that in a while so

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.289 
3 30 and 34 t let max that in a while so
I<00:01:56.850> guess<00:01:57.270> we'll<00:01:58.049> see<00:01:58.290> as<00:01:58.439> time<00:01:58.619> goes<00:01:58.920> on<00:01:59.100> as<00:01:59.670> for

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
I guess we'll see as time goes on as for

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.270 
I guess we'll see as time goes on as for
dead<00:02:00.509> list<00:02:00.750> it's<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:00.990> big<00:02:01.200> question<00:02:01.439> mark<00:02:01.740> I'm

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
dead list it's a big question mark I'm

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.760 
dead list it's a big question mark I'm
not<00:02:02.549> sure<00:02:02.939> how<00:02:03.180> strong<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.810> am<00:02:03.840> in<00:02:04.200> terms<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.649> a

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
not sure how strong I am in terms of a

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.249 
not sure how strong I am in terms of a
one<00:02:04.950> rep<00:02:05.130> max<00:02:05.159> I<00:02:05.820> have<00:02:05.969> not<00:02:06.180> maxed<00:02:06.659> out<00:02:06.810> since

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
one rep max I have not maxed out since

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.969 
one rep max I have not maxed out since
the<00:02:08.190> power<00:02:08.459> of<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.789> competition<00:02:09.090> I<00:02:09.800> have<00:02:10.800> been

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
the power of the competition I have been

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.710 
the power of the competition I have been
doing<00:02:11.099> super<00:02:11.670> high<00:02:11.819> reps<00:02:12.120> lately<00:02:12.480> which

straps touching

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.250 
straps touching
go<00:02:13.890> so<00:02:14.220> it's<00:02:14.490> not<00:02:14.580> really<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:15.090> good<00:02:15.480> indicator

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
go so it's not really a good indicator

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.510 
go so it's not really a good indicator
of<00:02:16.380> what<00:02:16.680> my<00:02:16.800> max<00:02:17.630> should<00:02:18.630> be<00:02:19.280> but<00:02:20.280> I<00:02:20.310> did

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
of what my max should be but I did
