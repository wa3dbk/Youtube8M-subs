test riding this and very different from
what<00:00:20.160> I've<00:00:20.279> used<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.640> I've<00:00:20.789> written<00:00:21.000> all<00:00:21.330> kinds

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
what I've used to I've written all kinds

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.790 
what I've used to I've written all kinds
of<00:00:21.750> bikes<00:00:22.189> right<00:00:23.189> out<00:00:24.199> standard<00:00:25.199> sport

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
of bikes right out standard sport

of bikes right out standard sport
touring<00:00:26.400> cruiser<00:00:26.730> these<00:00:27.570> are<00:00:27.750> really

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
touring cruiser these are really

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.630 
touring cruiser these are really
different<00:00:28.439> I<00:00:28.560> guess<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.920> first<00:00:29.099> obvious

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
different I guess the first obvious

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.070 
different I guess the first obvious
thing<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.029> went<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.300> set<00:00:30.480> my<00:00:30.599> helmet<00:00:30.929> on<00:00:31.050> the

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
thing is I went to set my helmet on the

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.740 
thing is I went to set my helmet on the
seat<00:00:31.410> start<00:00:31.769> it<00:00:31.949> anything<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.520> set<00:00:33.360> on<00:00:33.510> this

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
seat start it anything you set on this

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.530 
seat start it anything you set on this
is<00:00:33.960> hopefully<00:00:34.530> it's<00:00:34.620> going<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.800> shake<00:00:35.160> off

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.299 

just<00:00:39.540> some<00:00:39.690> first<00:00:39.930> impressions<00:00:40.079> not<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.800> review

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
just some first impressions not a review

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.180 
just some first impressions not a review
it's<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.120> demo<00:00:42.360> bike<00:00:42.719> this<00:00:43.230> is<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.440> little<00:00:43.739> stiff

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
it's a demo bike this is a little stiff

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.740 
it's a demo bike this is a little stiff
probably<00:00:45.149> good<00:00:45.410> different<00:00:46.410> shifter<00:00:46.860> would

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
probably good different shifter would

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.840 
probably good different shifter would
probably<00:00:48.750> solve<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.430> one<00:00:50.430> thing<00:00:50.579> I<00:00:50.670> got<00:00:50.820> to

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
probably solve that one thing I got to

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.529 
probably solve that one thing I got to
say<00:00:51.120> despite<00:00:51.600> what<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:51.989> hear<00:00:52.500> with<00:00:52.770> these<00:00:52.980> I

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
say despite what you hear with these I

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:55.910 
say despite what you hear with these I
pulled<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.660> into<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.930> parking<00:00:55.440> lot<00:00:55.469> here<00:00:55.800> and

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
pulled it into a parking lot here and

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.920 
pulled it into a parking lot here and
just<00:00:56.129> tried<00:00:56.370> some<00:00:56.640> slow-motion<00:00:57.420> maneuvers

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
just tried some slow-motion maneuvers

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.790 
just tried some slow-motion maneuvers
and<00:00:58.520> it<00:00:59.520> isn't<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.059> huge<00:01:00.359> bike<00:01:00.629> but<00:01:01.289> there's

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
and it isn't a huge bike but there's

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.650 
and it isn't a huge bike but there's
some<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.309> just<00:01:02.550> don't<00:01:02.699> lend<00:01:03.000> themselves<00:01:03.510> to

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
some that just don't lend themselves to

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.039 
some that just don't lend themselves to
just<00:01:04.220> doing<00:01:05.220> slow<00:01:05.519> u-turns<00:01:06.119> well<00:01:06.420> this<00:01:06.810> thing

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
just doing slow u-turns well this thing

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.830 
just doing slow u-turns well this thing
is<00:01:07.080> great<00:01:09.530> an<00:01:10.530> engines<00:01:11.250> too<00:01:11.460> powerful<00:01:12.030> for<00:01:12.330> a

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
is great an engines too powerful for a

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.880 
is great an engines too powerful for a
learner<00:01:14.150> ideally<00:01:15.150> but<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.750> just<00:01:15.990> it's<00:01:16.290> such<00:01:16.710> an

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
learner ideally but it just it's such an

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.270 
learner ideally but it just it's such an
easy<00:01:17.159> bike<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.729> turn<00:01:18.030> I'm<00:01:18.450> really<00:01:19.350> shocked<00:01:20.040> by

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
easy bike to turn I'm really shocked by

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.130 
easy bike to turn I'm really shocked by
that

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140

is having the signals on the left and
right<00:01:33.380> side<00:01:33.650> instead<00:01:33.979> of<00:01:34.159> just<00:01:34.310> one<00:01:34.520> control

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
right side instead of just one control

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.290 
right side instead of just one control
that's<00:01:35.720> that's<00:01:36.140> um<00:01:36.619> that's<00:01:37.010> kind<00:01:37.910> of<00:01:38.000> messing

with<00:01:38.330> me<00:01:38.600> a<00:01:38.630> bit<00:01:38.869> but<00:01:39.080> not<00:01:39.229> a<00:01:39.259> big<00:01:39.530> deal<00:01:39.800> it's<00:01:40.490> a

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
with me a bit but not a big deal it's a

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.710 
with me a bit but not a big deal it's a
very<00:01:40.759> stripped-down<00:01:41.150> bike<00:01:41.600> of<00:01:41.960> the<00:01:42.850> the<00:01:43.850> turn

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
very stripped-down bike of the the turn

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.550 
very stripped-down bike of the the turn
signaling<00:01:46.119> if<00:01:47.119> you<00:01:47.300> leave<00:01:47.479> your<00:01:47.930> turn<00:01:48.110> signal

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
signaling if you leave your turn signal

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.190 
signaling if you leave your turn signal
on<00:01:48.710> their<00:01:49.340> self<00:01:49.640> canceling<00:01:50.270> if<00:01:50.420> you<00:01:50.570> go

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
on their self canceling if you go

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.560 
on their self canceling if you go
through<00:01:51.409> a<00:01:51.440> corner<00:01:51.470> but<00:01:52.100> very<00:01:52.700> very<00:01:52.970> clear

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
through a corner but very very clear

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.730 
through a corner but very very clear
like<00:01:54.229> the<00:01:54.380> big<00:01:54.610> analog<00:01:55.610> display<00:01:55.880> and<00:01:56.570> it<00:01:57.500> seems

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
like the big analog display and it seems

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.690 
like the big analog display and it seems
to<00:01:57.890> be<00:01:58.009> poked<00:01:58.280> up<00:01:59.470> more<00:02:00.470> forward<00:02:01.009> gear<00:02:01.280> so<00:02:01.580> if

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
to be poked up more forward gear so if

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.370 
to be poked up more forward gear so if
you<00:02:01.820> have<00:02:01.910> with<00:02:02.240> glasses<00:02:02.780> don't<00:02:02.990> have<00:02:03.200> like

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
you have with glasses don't have like

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.139 
you have with glasses don't have like
vision<00:02:03.890> under<00:02:04.310> it<00:02:04.460> mean<00:02:04.640> you<00:02:04.700> got<00:02:04.850> to<00:02:04.940> pull

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
vision under it mean you got to pull

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:06.550 
vision under it mean you got to pull
down<00:02:05.300> take<00:02:05.600> your<00:02:05.690> eyes<00:02:05.840> off<00:02:05.869> the<00:02:06.229> road<00:02:06.259> a<00:02:06.440> bit

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
down take your eyes off the road a bit

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.449 
down take your eyes off the road a bit
but<00:02:06.950> doesn't<00:02:07.759> seem<00:02:07.940> to<00:02:08.119> be<00:02:08.300> not<00:02:09.110> undoable<00:02:09.979> but

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
but doesn't seem to be not undoable but

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.280 
but doesn't seem to be not undoable but
yes<00:02:10.850> so<00:02:11.090> far<00:02:11.269> I'm<00:02:11.420> really<00:02:11.450> liking<00:02:11.660> this<00:02:12.019> bike
