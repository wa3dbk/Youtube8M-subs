00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.010
 baseball bat you it may be 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.650

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.870
 like me, I have the baseball bat 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.769
 your friend in front of him at the foot of 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.739
 doe you 're going for 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:08.109
 firstly tears the closest to 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.519
 your so here's the baseball bat do not 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:12.569
 you pass on it as for the club of 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.569
 golf and it will pick up 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.310
 and once you 've picked up the bat 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.260
 of baseball you can go to 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.280
 your friend's side to fetch 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.280
 the crowbar 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:51.579
 so here's the crowbar is here in 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.260
 a hole that plays the same you 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:54.909
 pick up and you'll have it in your weapons 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.859
 when you die you do not lose 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:57.760
 that's what's cool 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:59.079
 so here I have the crow's feet 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.790
 So by the little bichon against the 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:02.409
 level of damage practically does 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:06.280
 nothing you have to put a little near three 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:08.230
 shots for the person to die small 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.849
 bonus to get molotov cocktails 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.250
 you will need to call meriwether 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:15.659
 and call it the real reasons for 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.659
 munitions thousand thousand dollars 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.410
 once the delivery order and you 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.389
 will wait until it is your book 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.800
 so to recover the ammo by 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:29.289
 earth you're going to need a weapon at the 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.370
 hand and so here we can see that 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:31.840
 it comes from this book so is I going 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.789
 take a gun by hand for the 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.940
 pick up and you'll see that I want 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:38.620
 get three molotov cocktails 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.900
 like what if the e3 or October spas 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.220
 so if your friend calls a checkout 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.530
 ammo you pick it up and you 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.060
 so will look top side so it can not 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.320
 that he is there I threw them where he 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.760
 although bah that's cool it burns well 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.260

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.490
