00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 hi this is nicolas for ps video 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.430
 tutorial I'm happy with you 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.350
 to find then today I'll go 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.090
 do a tutorial on how to change the 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.639
 hair color of a person who 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.920
 have black hair I specify because 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.420
 that I have already made a subject there 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.390
 on it that was called how 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.090
 change the color of the hair 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:23.970
 this help about two years ago and that 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.160
 was one of the biggest eyes one of the most 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.420
 big hits with regular demand 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.470
 and frequent how to do the same thing 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.699
 on black hair because that 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.700
 not walk this technique does not work 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.380
 not about black hair and is well 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.530
 what are we going to see now so 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.680
 the result is that it drowns good 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.270
 Obviously we will not lie it 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.129
 less than in reality 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.660
 this said the hairdressers also have 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.129
 some difficulties to change the 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.230
 black hair color will require 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.780
 speak clear up good we are going to get 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.149
 to go through this step but hey 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.899
 does not hurt too much 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:58.260
 and all in 3 to make up what is rather 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.000
 succinct 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.770
 this technique works I you the 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.899
 precise because it's important on 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.880
 all versions of photoshop this 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.640
 I try 6 but it works with the 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.110
 others the first thing to do 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.790
 consists in making a selection of 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.939
 hair for wise press the key 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.850
 q from the keyboard one enters one enters the 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.170
 quick selection mode that will us 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.869
 allow to make a mask after I 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.090
 you barratin not right now 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:26.460
 then we attack with the help of buttons 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.500
 of the keyboard two points and point 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.720
 of exclamation it allows me to increase 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.670
 and reduce the size of my tool 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.409
 brush that was activated at the moment I 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.840
 got into the selection mode 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.150
 fast and actually I'm going to paint 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.180
 the con not to quote and before that does not 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.630
 I'm not interested I pass it to 100 and I 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.700
 just go on while on the area 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.950
 which interests me a quick selection in 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.600
 frankly there you do not bother to 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.960
 to do in detail we will do after in 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:02:00.180
 the detail we will send takka takka 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:02.479
 takka takka here we go of course 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.479
 hair 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:15.310
 here we are here we are hop on 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:20.709
 know not too bad but there is one missing 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:23.830
 little sailing then when the selection 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.720
 is over we press again on the 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.440
 more touch of the keyboard 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.150
 that's it and we end up with a 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.250
 selection from where the term quick selection 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.580
 it was quick to do it's a 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.310
 quick selection then I click on 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.140
 this little button and I'm going to clear up 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.380
 lightly hair so I create a 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:44.470
 layer of curves and game that I draw 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.930
 slightly then there is nothing happening 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.430
 on the hair because to tell the truth 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.670
 selection we had turned 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:55.209
 in mask but the mask must 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:57.910
 the inverted control an apple is there 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:02.500
 here is that the hair that is 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:04.209
 thinning we will not ripen everything from 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.079
 Following the selection because here we are 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.430
 sees nothing so I then create a 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:12.329
 new layer by pressing this button 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:15.390
 there and I will fill it with color 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:17.140
 I want it right I want m pink 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:21.730
 because it makes me happy 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:23.109
 hop then everything is fine panic mode 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.209
 then I pressed the alt key 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:27.250
 keyboard then I click on the mask 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.890
 which is here and I drop it 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.290
 allow to copy the mask so there we 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.030
 has pink hair on it is ok 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.840
 well continue now i'm going on the 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.700
 dimmed light mode and color 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.459
 applies to hair so a base of 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.560
 departure is not perfect we will refine 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:47.650
 we will refine it now especially in 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:50.560
 working on the contours of the mask 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.130
 then a mask consisted of two 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.750
 colors 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.220
 this one I press his alt key of 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.889
 keyboard and I click on the mask 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.850
 or and that they display zooms a 

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:59.230
 little 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.210
 so it's in two colors what is 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.950
 white appears what is black 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:06.280
 do not appear here it's easy it's easy 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.900
 not hard I rely on alt halte 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.760
 click on my mask to do it 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.240
 disappear 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:15.280
 So using the tool brushes and 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.709
 we white and black colors that are 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.660
 here well then we will work this mask 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:23.500
 so I zoom in on more apples 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:28.840
 more and I reduce where I comment on the 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.920
 size of my brush up and I'm painting there 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.470
 where I do not want only to colors 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.880
 therefore appear on the areas of the 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.110
 skin me it's not complicated I just 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.770
 to clear 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.170
 and then that's it but there are places where 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.250
 it's going to be a bit more complicated 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:44.860
 in fact, we will have to create 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.210
 transitions because the ca can not 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.620
 to be or white or black 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.500
 it will have to be a little grilled 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:53.830
 for that I'm going to reduce the opacity of my 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:58.900
 brush here about 20 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:05:01.090
 or even even 10 and I'm going in 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.170
 black I clicked to clear slightly 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.000
 the content in fact I 'm going to be full 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:06.850
 small clicks very slowly full of 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.700
 little clicks and it's going to create 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.930
 a softer transition zone 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:16.240
 so here's a lot of little clicks 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:20.590
 on the edge of the hair here then a 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:22.210
 fun thing is that you will have to 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.840
 refine the mask according to the 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.560
 chosen color 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:28.360
 so do not ask why but the 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.030
 selection I'm doing here on my mask 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.750
 will not be the same if I have blue in 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:36.970
 the hair if I had to jonsi so here 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:40.050
 prepare to have to refine your 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.050
 mask according to the color 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:47.260
 this is up full of small clicks 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:54.590
 here I am doing it quickly but at home 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:06:00.020
 try to do that a little bit more 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:02.360
 conscientious surely that I here in 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.910
 also does it on the end of the hair there he 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.070
 must be a little less bright 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:08.600
 because because there is less 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.850
 materials so it's not supposed to be as 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.860
 colorful than that inside the hair 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:14.740
 so there we go well on the other on 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:21.170
 the extremities 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:22.100
 here it is not so bad 

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.900
 again I do it quickly 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.180
 you will have more time there I record 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.730
 a video we must necessarily go 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.380
 quick 

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:31.760
 ok so we now have a base with 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:35.060
 a color that does a little bit 

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:37.430
 dummy anyway we clarified the 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:40.130
 hair we will drop a little bit 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:43.340
 the intensity of this layer to get 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:45.290
 a color a bit more realistic and 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.540
 now last step I'm going back 

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:49.340
 here no but ho full in my few 

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.920
 settings I want to overdriven and 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:54.230
 saturation like everything at their game 

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:56.030
 I press the alt key on the keyboard 

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:57.290
 click on my mask and I lead it 

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:58.960
 on the upper bedrooms like that I 

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:03.230
 copy the mask 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:07.370
 I click here and in fact I will 

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:09.920
 now change the color with more 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.720
 precision the intensity of the 

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:14.510
 brightness 

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:18.770
 well, we're going to leave that to 0 

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:21.860
 saturation and that's it and the color that goes 

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:22.430
 allow to have a rendering more or less 

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.660
 realistic 

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.250
 there we are sure of colors that are 

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:27.640
 relatively realistic there we are on the 

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:31.940
 colors that are rather wig 

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:33.190
 this is a very wig so here 

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:35.360
 now it's up to you 

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:38.000
 the results that wanted to get but 

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:40.940
 here we have a kind of chestnuts 

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.860
 light brown not quite frank 

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:43.430
 maybe can still work with the 

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.770
 saturation 

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:47.150
 finally I'll leave you 

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:48.530
 choose sent between wasquehal we have 

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.450
 managed to change a hair color 

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:51.740
 who was black at first I could on the 

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:52.700
 alt key on the keyboard is safe the little 

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:56.540
 eye there 

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:57.050
 all masked and rendering is rather of 

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:59.570
 rather not bad 

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:01.400
 here I leave you try yourself 

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:02.570
 on your own photos and do not hesitate 

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:06.340
 to comment if you have any questions 

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:06.340
 or if you liked this video
