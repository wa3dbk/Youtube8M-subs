and<00:00:11.639> you<00:00:11.880> you<00:00:12.210> see<00:00:12.480> already<00:00:12.809> that<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.519> concept

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
and you you see already that the concept

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.840 
and you you see already that the concept
of<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.969> paper<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:16.320> scientific<00:00:16.830> paper<00:00:17.039> is

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
of the paper the scientific paper is

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.420 
of the paper the scientific paper is
eroding<00:00:18.510> before<00:00:18.930> our<00:00:19.050> very<00:00:19.260> eyes<00:00:19.410> there<00:00:20.250> used

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
eroding before our very eyes there used

eroding before our very eyes there used
to<00:00:20.550> be<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.760> an<00:00:21.330> object<00:00:21.810> that<00:00:21.960> had<00:00:22.140> an

to be a an object that had an

to be a an object that had an
introduction<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.460> results<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.359> an

introduction and results and an

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.509 
introduction and results and an
experimental<00:00:25.050> section<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.920> you<00:00:26.010> look<00:00:26.310> at<00:00:26.430> the

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
experimental section and you look at the

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.839 
experimental section and you look at the
experimental<00:00:26.939> section<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.949> this<00:00:28.949> was<00:00:29.220> full

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
experimental section and this was full

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.939 
experimental section and this was full
of<00:00:30.000> really<00:00:30.539> important<00:00:30.990> detail<00:00:31.109> up<00:00:31.619> front

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
of really important detail up front

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.229 
of really important detail up front
there<00:00:32.160> was<00:00:32.279> this<00:00:32.399> little<00:00:32.550> thing<00:00:32.700> called<00:00:33.120> an

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
there was this little thing called an

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.500 
there was this little thing called an
abstract<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.710> was<00:00:34.800> almost<00:00:34.980> incidental

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
abstract and that was almost incidental

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.240 
abstract and that was almost incidental
papers<00:00:36.510> now<00:00:36.690> are<00:00:36.930> in<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.380> sense<00:00:37.620> extended

of<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.780> paper<00:00:42.989> has<00:00:43.230> been<00:00:43.440> put<00:00:43.680> in<00:00:43.829> what<00:00:44.160> we

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
of the paper has been put in what we

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.279 
of the paper has been put in what we
used<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.610> call<00:00:44.760> supplemental<00:00:45.450> but<00:00:45.690> now<00:00:45.840> with

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
used to call supplemental but now with

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.369 
used to call supplemental but now with
everything<00:00:46.559> electronic<00:00:47.300> it's<00:00:48.300> not<00:00:48.539> quite

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
everything electronic it's not quite

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.770 
everything electronic it's not quite
clear<00:00:49.800> where<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.610> useful<00:00:51.000> information<00:00:51.180> is

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
clear where the useful information is

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.619 
clear where the useful information is
but<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.739> think<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:53.850> let<00:00:54.360> me<00:00:54.449> see<00:00:54.600> I

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
but I think the and that let me see I

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.020 
but I think the and that let me see I
think<00:00:54.690> this<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.140> all<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.500> good<00:00:55.620> because<00:00:56.219> if

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
think this is all to the good because if

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.529 
think this is all to the good because if
you<00:00:57.360> have<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.780> read<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.379> very<00:00:58.800> complex<00:00:59.510> set<00:01:00.510> of

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
you have to read a very complex set of

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.619 
you have to read a very complex set of
words<00:01:00.980> many<00:01:01.980> pages<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.850> stuff<00:01:03.210> in<00:01:03.390> order<00:01:03.570> to

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
words many pages of stuff in order to

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.990 
words many pages of stuff in order to
figure<00:01:03.809> out<00:01:03.930> what's<00:01:04.229> going<00:01:04.559> on<00:01:04.880> then<00:01:05.880> you're

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
figure out what's going on then you're

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.880 
figure out what's going on then you're
not<00:01:06.119> likely<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.600> do<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:06.900> there<00:01:07.500> are<00:01:07.530> just<00:01:07.619> too

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
not likely to do it there are just too

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.190 
not likely to do it there are just too
many<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.220> these<00:01:08.340> things<00:01:08.640> around<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.360> make<00:01:09.390> make

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
many of these things around to make make

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.750 
many of these things around to make make
it<00:01:10.350> worth<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.680> effort<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.580> extent

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
it worth the effort so to the extent

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.140 
it worth the effort so to the extent
that<00:01:11.970> we<00:01:12.180> can<00:01:12.420> find<00:01:12.930> ways<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.350> taking

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
that we can find ways of taking

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.910 
that we can find ways of taking
scientific<00:01:15.150> results<00:01:15.659> abstracting<00:01:16.439> from<00:01:16.710> them

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
scientific results abstracting from them

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.920 
scientific results abstracting from them
the<00:01:17.130> thing<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.670> most<00:01:17.909> important<00:01:18.600> and

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
the thing that is most important and

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.010 
the thing that is most important and
then<00:01:19.490> making<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.640> clear<00:01:20.939> with<00:01:21.450> all<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.810> rest

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
then making that clear with all the rest

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.010 
then making that clear with all the rest
being<00:01:22.259> supporting<00:01:22.830> detail<00:01:23.220> terrific<00:01:24.020> but

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
being supporting detail terrific but

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.749 
being supporting detail terrific but
there's<00:01:25.619> some<00:01:25.799> changes<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.340> think<00:01:26.400> are

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
there's some changes that I think are

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.270 
there's some changes that I think are
bigger<00:01:27.270> changes<00:01:27.780> along<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.290> way<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.799> don't

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
bigger changes along the way I don't

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.190 
bigger changes along the way I don't
know<00:01:29.520> how<00:01:29.850> people<00:01:29.909> are<00:01:30.240> going<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.600> read<00:01:30.840> when

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
know how people are going to read when

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.620 
know how people are going to read when
they're<00:01:31.409> as<00:01:32.159> we<00:01:32.670> have<00:01:32.790> presently<00:01:33.270> evolved

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
they're as we have presently evolved

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.010 
they're as we have presently evolved
when<00:01:33.840> there<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.140> no<00:01:34.350> paper<00:01:35.299> PNAS<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.659> science

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
when there is no paper PNAS and science

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.450 
when there is no paper PNAS and science
and<00:01:37.170> nature<00:01:37.320> still<00:01:37.770> are<00:01:37.950> paper<00:01:38.189> based

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
and nature still are paper based

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.969 
and nature still are paper based
journals<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.180> I<00:01:39.360> happen<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.689> like<00:01:39.930> paper<00:01:40.200> but

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
journals and I happen to like paper but

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.160 
journals and I happen to like paper but
many<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.759> ACS<00:01:42.119> journals<00:01:42.479> don't<00:01:42.600> exist<00:01:43.049> in

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
many of the ACS journals don't exist in

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.289 
many of the ACS journals don't exist in
paper<00:01:43.409> form<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.460> think<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.759> interaction

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
paper form and I think the interaction

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.260 
paper form and I think the interaction
between<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:46.290> author<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:47.520> journal<00:01:47.549> on<00:01:48.240> a

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
between the author the journal on a

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.569 
between the author the journal on a
screen<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.140> paper<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.890> just<00:01:50.070> going<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.490> be

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
screen and paper is just going to be

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.760 
screen and paper is just going to be
fundamentally<00:01:51.180> different<00:01:51.290> but<00:01:52.290> even<00:01:52.439> more

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
fundamentally different but even more

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.240 
fundamentally different but even more
interesting<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.610> serious<00:01:53.820> are<00:01:54.479> things<00:01:54.750> like

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
interesting and serious are things like

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.480 
interesting and serious are things like
mail<00:01:56.250> video<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.960> increasingly<00:01:58.860> find<00:01:59.250> that

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
mail video and I increasingly find that

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.539 
mail video and I increasingly find that
the<00:01:59.969> stuff<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:00.450> we<00:02:00.570> do<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:01.049> has<00:02:01.549> probably

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
the stuff that we do that has probably

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.469 
the stuff that we do that has probably
the<00:02:03.000> greatest<00:02:03.270> impact<00:02:04.200> in<00:02:04.530> some<00:02:05.210> metrics<00:02:06.210> is

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
the greatest impact in some metrics is

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.040 
the greatest impact in some metrics is
done<00:02:07.110> in<00:02:07.290> in<00:02:07.710> video<00:02:08.009> format<00:02:08.489> not<00:02:08.970> in<00:02:09.330> paper

well if where you were was everyone was
doing<00:02:56.680> science<00:02:57.280> that<00:02:57.580> was<00:02:57.700> really<00:02:57.970> catchy<00:02:58.240> and

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
doing science that was really catchy and

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.110 
doing science that was really catchy and
justified<00:02:59.410> it<00:02:59.590> you'd<00:03:00.040> have<00:03:00.370> been<00:03:00.580> a<00:03:00.610> wonderful

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
justified it you'd have been a wonderful

situation because the world of excited

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.310 
situation because the world of excited
just<00:03:03.280> be<00:03:03.430> exploding<00:03:03.940> but<00:03:04.600> in<00:03:04.870> fact<00:03:05.080> what

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
just be exploding but in fact what

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.180 
just be exploding but in fact what
happens<00:03:05.680> as<00:03:06.280> we<00:03:06.580> all<00:03:06.700> know<00:03:06.880> is<00:03:07.060> that<00:03:07.090> there<00:03:07.990> are

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
happens as we all know is that there are

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.770 
happens as we all know is that there are
occasional<00:03:09.190> papers<00:03:09.610> which<00:03:09.910> open<00:03:10.330> doors<00:03:10.600> and

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
occasional papers which open doors and

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.380 
occasional papers which open doors and
are<00:03:11.020> new<00:03:11.290> and<00:03:11.650> do<00:03:12.130> neat<00:03:12.370> stuff<00:03:12.670> and<00:03:13.030> then

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
are new and do neat stuff and then

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.580 
are new and do neat stuff and then
there's<00:03:13.600> a<00:03:13.660> lot<00:03:13.900> of<00:03:13.990> work<00:03:14.110> which<00:03:14.380> is<00:03:14.410> also

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
there's a lot of work which is also

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.500 
there's a lot of work which is also
extremely<00:03:15.100> good<00:03:15.550> work<00:03:15.730> which<00:03:15.940> develops<00:03:16.390> these

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
extremely good work which develops these

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.290 
extremely good work which develops these
ideas<00:03:16.900> and<00:03:17.110> the<00:03:17.680> first<00:03:17.920> experiment<00:03:18.700> might<00:03:19.090> be

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
ideas and the first experiment might be

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.300 
ideas and the first experiment might be
really<00:03:19.780> neat<00:03:20.020> and<00:03:20.170> catchy<00:03:20.440> but<00:03:20.770> it<00:03:20.890> typically

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
really neat and catchy but it typically

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.030 
really neat and catchy but it typically
doesn't<00:03:21.580> solve<00:03:21.880> any<00:03:22.090> really<00:03:22.360> big<00:03:22.570> problem<00:03:23.080> it

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
doesn't solve any really big problem it

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.220 
doesn't solve any really big problem it
requires<00:03:24.660> development<00:03:25.660> at<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:25.870> level<00:03:26.110> of

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
requires development at the level of

commercialization<00:03:31.540> and<00:03:31.720> you<00:03:31.870> know<00:03:32.020> this<00:03:32.470> is<00:03:32.650> a

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
commercialization and you know this is a

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.010 
commercialization and you know this is a
process<00:03:33.310> that<00:03:33.459> goes<00:03:33.640> on<00:03:33.850> for<00:03:34.060> a<00:03:34.090> long<00:03:34.150> time<00:03:34.330> it

process that goes on for a long time it

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.210 
process that goes on for a long time it
is<00:03:35.230> annoying<00:03:36.100> when<00:03:36.820> you<00:03:37.000> find<00:03:37.540> a<00:03:37.950> paper<00:03:38.950> with

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
is annoying when you find a paper with

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.750 
is annoying when you find a paper with
what<00:03:40.180> has<00:03:40.360> obviously<00:03:41.430> been<00:03:42.900> painted<00:03:43.900> to<00:03:44.050> be<00:03:44.230> a

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
what has obviously been painted to be a

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.860 
what has obviously been painted to be a
breathtakingly<00:03:45.760> new<00:03:46.060> result<00:03:46.480> which<00:03:46.720> is

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
breathtakingly new result which is

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.870 
breathtakingly new result which is
basically<00:03:47.350> just<00:03:47.470> the<00:03:47.770> same<00:03:47.980> old<00:03:48.010> stuff<00:03:48.520> just

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
basically just the same old stuff just

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.330 
basically just the same old stuff just
painted<00:03:49.570> a<00:03:49.660> slightly<00:03:49.900> different<00:03:50.110> color<00:03:50.440> but

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
painted a slightly different color but

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.220 
painted a slightly different color but
you<00:03:51.459> usually<00:03:51.730> figure<00:03:52.120> that<00:03:52.360> out<00:03:52.540> in<00:03:52.780> a<00:03:53.050> very

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
you usually figure that out in a very

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.750 
you usually figure that out in a very
short<00:03:53.470> period<00:03:53.680> of<00:03:53.860> time<00:03:53.920> and<00:03:54.310> you<00:03:54.400> just<00:03:54.550> skip

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
short period of time and you just skip

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.270 
short period of time and you just skip
over<00:03:54.940> and<00:03:55.240> then<00:03:55.480> at<00:03:56.380> least<00:03:56.470> I<00:03:56.680> do<00:03:56.740> tend<00:03:57.100> not<00:03:57.130> to

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
over and then at least I do tend not to

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.900 
over and then at least I do tend not to
read<00:03:57.550> that<00:03:58.590> authors<00:03:59.590> papers<00:04:00.190> again<00:04:00.670> very

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
read that authors papers again very

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.360 
read that authors papers again very
seriously
