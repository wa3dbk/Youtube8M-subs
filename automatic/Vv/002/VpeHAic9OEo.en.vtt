00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:11.840 
the one-way Chuck which I prefer to use

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.390 
the one-way Chuck which I prefer to use
whatever<00:00:12.840> Chucky<00:00:13.350> used<00:00:13.559> just<00:00:13.860> be<00:00:14.010> proficient

whatever Chucky used just be proficient

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.120 
whatever Chucky used just be proficient
with<00:00:14.670> it<00:00:15.800> to<00:00:16.800> set<00:00:17.039> this<00:00:17.250> up<00:00:18.740> if<00:00:19.740> you<00:00:19.859> have<00:00:20.039> the

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.400 

there's<00:00:26.189> it's<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.580> longer<00:00:26.849> process<00:00:27.289> using<00:00:28.289> this

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
there's it's a longer process using this

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.069 
there's it's a longer process using this
because<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:29.130> have<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.369> take<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.759> jaws<00:00:30.660> off

the chuck replace this jaw and then if

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.190 
the chuck replace this jaw and then if
you<00:00:33.810> have<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.170> move<00:00:34.380> where<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.430> bumpers<00:00:35.790> were

the<00:02:35.770> other<00:02:35.920> aspect<00:02:36.520> of<00:02:36.700> these<00:02:37.000> jaws<00:02:37.360> are<00:02:37.780> you

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
the other aspect of these jaws are you

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.030 
the other aspect of these jaws are you
have<00:02:38.710> to<00:02:38.860> have<00:02:39.040> a<00:02:39.370> lathe<00:02:39.640> that<00:02:40.120> has<00:02:41.050> a<00:02:41.470> spindle

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
have to have a lathe that has a spindle

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.990 
have to have a lathe that has a spindle
height<00:02:42.250> of<00:02:42.580> at<00:02:43.060> least<00:02:44.400> seven<00:02:45.400> inches<00:02:45.700> if<00:02:45.880> the

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
height of at least seven inches if the

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.410 
height of at least seven inches if the
jaws<00:02:46.240> were<00:02:46.510> completely<00:02:46.900> closed<00:02:48.210> but<00:02:49.210> more

jaws were completely closed but more

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.750 
jaws were completely closed but more
than<00:02:49.510> likely<00:02:49.570> when<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.320> jaws<00:02:50.530> are<00:02:50.800> open<00:02:51.160> eight

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
than likely when the jaws are open eight

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.100 
than likely when the jaws are open eight
inches<00:02:52.150> is<00:02:52.300> probably<00:02:54.810> what<00:02:55.810> you're<00:02:55.960> going<00:02:56.080> to

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
inches is probably what you're going to

inches is probably what you're going to
need<00:02:56.290> there<00:02:56.680> are<00:02:56.710> smaller<00:02:57.220> jaws<00:02:57.580> these<00:02:57.940> are

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
need there are smaller jaws these are

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.030 
need there are smaller jaws these are
the<00:02:58.180> mega<00:02:58.420> jumbo<00:03:00.660> because<00:03:01.660> they<00:03:01.780> fit<00:03:02.020> on<00:03:02.170> the

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
the mega jumbo because they fit on the

the mega jumbo because they fit on the
Powermatic<00:03:03.610> and<00:03:03.790> that<00:03:04.120> way<00:03:04.270> I<00:03:04.560> can<00:03:05.560> use<00:03:05.620> the

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460 
Powermatic and that way I can use the

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.820 
Powermatic and that way I can use the
holes<00:03:06.670> anywhere<00:03:07.150> you<00:03:07.390> go<00:03:07.570> as<00:03:08.230> I<00:03:08.470> mentioned

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
holes anywhere you go as I mentioned

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.150 
holes anywhere you go as I mentioned
earlier<00:03:09.160> this<00:03:09.550> process<00:03:10.480> from<00:03:11.290> the<00:03:11.410> jaws<00:03:11.860> that

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
earlier this process from the jaws that

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.430 
earlier this process from the jaws that
were<00:03:12.280> on<00:03:12.430> there<00:03:12.700> to<00:03:13.690> taking<00:03:14.020> these<00:03:14.140> off<00:03:14.410> so

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
were on there to taking these off so

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.820 
were on there to taking these off so
you've<00:03:14.800> got<00:03:15.120> two<00:03:16.120> screws<00:03:16.480> out<00:03:16.750> and<00:03:17.080> then<00:03:17.590> two

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
you've got two screws out and then two

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.290 
you've got two screws out and then two
screws<00:03:18.220> in<00:03:18.870> so<00:03:19.870> that's<00:03:20.080> four<00:03:20.440> and<00:03:20.760> it's<00:03:21.760> a<00:03:21.880> 32

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
screws in so that's four and it's a 32

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.030 
screws in so that's four and it's a 32
step<00:03:22.630> process<00:03:23.170> and<00:03:23.200> that's<00:03:23.470> assuming<00:03:23.860> that

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
step process and that's assuming that

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.490 
step process and that's assuming that
you<00:03:24.280> don't<00:03:24.460> have<00:03:24.610> to<00:03:24.790> adjust<00:03:25.180> any<00:03:26.110> of<00:03:26.260> your

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
you don't have to adjust any of your

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.610 
you don't have to adjust any of your
outer<00:03:26.650> ones<00:03:27.010> so<00:03:27.460> it<00:03:28.300> takes<00:03:28.540> a<00:03:28.810> few<00:03:29.320> minutes

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
outer ones so it takes a few minutes

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.440 
outer ones so it takes a few minutes
it's<00:03:29.860> not<00:03:30.010> a<00:03:30.130> big<00:03:30.340> deal

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
it's not a big deal

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.170 
it's not a big deal
but<00:03:31.989> if<00:03:32.080> you've<00:03:32.200> got<00:03:32.230> a<00:03:32.379> vacuum<00:03:32.650> check<00:03:33.099> or<00:03:33.370> a

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
but if you've got a vacuum check or a

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.650 
but if you've got a vacuum check or a
dedicated<00:03:35.340> Chuck<00:03:36.340> body<00:03:36.640> to<00:03:37.300> leave<00:03:37.480> these

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
dedicated Chuck body to leave these

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.330 
dedicated Chuck body to leave these
setup<00:03:38.019> on<00:03:38.230> then<00:03:38.769> you<00:03:38.860> don't<00:03:39.010> have<00:03:39.069> to<00:03:39.190> worry

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
setup on then you don't have to worry

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.430 
setup on then you don't have to worry
about<00:03:39.430> that<00:03:39.700> okay<00:03:40.540> so<00:03:40.599> go<00:03:40.930> ahead<00:03:41.050> and<00:03:41.260> mount

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
about that okay so go ahead and mount

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:53.309 
about that okay so go ahead and mount
this<00:03:45.209> put<00:03:46.209> the<00:03:46.330> Chuck<00:03:46.540> on<00:03:46.780> the<00:03:47.140> spindle<00:03:52.319> place

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
this put the Chuck on the spindle place

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:55.229 
this put the Chuck on the spindle place
the<00:03:53.500> bowl<00:03:53.680> up<00:03:53.860> against<00:03:54.190> the<00:03:54.340> bumpers<00:03:54.670> now<00:03:54.940> this

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
the bowl up against the bumpers now this

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.770 
the bowl up against the bumpers now this
is<00:03:55.390> going<00:03:55.569> to<00:03:55.630> be<00:03:55.780> an<00:03:55.840> expansion<00:03:56.290> mode<00:03:57.780> the

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
is going to be an expansion mode the

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.050 
is going to be an expansion mode the
only<00:03:58.959> thing<00:03:59.170> we're<00:03:59.319> doing<00:03:59.440> is<00:04:02.849> cleaning<00:04:03.849> up

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
only thing we're doing is cleaning up

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.270 
only thing we're doing is cleaning up
the<00:04:04.989> foot<00:04:05.319> so<00:04:05.620> we're<00:04:05.769> not<00:04:05.860> going<00:04:06.010> to<00:04:06.099> be<00:04:06.160> doing

the foot so we're not going to be doing

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.759 
the foot so we're not going to be doing
a<00:04:06.400> lot<00:04:06.519> of<00:04:06.549> cranking<00:04:07.120> on<00:04:07.209> this<00:04:07.480> so<00:04:08.470> you<00:04:08.500> don't

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
a lot of cranking on this so you don't

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:12.539

it says the max maximum rpm for these

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.490 
it says the max maximum rpm for these
jaws<00:04:49.930> is<00:04:50.260> 1000<00:04:51.100> I<00:04:51.630> recommend<00:04:52.630> not<00:04:52.990> going

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
jaws is 1000 I recommend not going

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.640 
jaws is 1000 I recommend not going
anywhere<00:04:53.980> close<00:04:54.310> to<00:04:54.340> that<00:04:55.350> staying<00:04:56.350> well

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
anywhere close to that staying well

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.540 
anywhere close to that staying well
under<00:04:57.150> 500<00:04:58.620> again<00:04:59.620> all<00:04:59.800> you're<00:04:59.950> doing<00:05:00.220> is<00:05:00.280> a

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
under 500 again all you're doing is a

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
under 500 again all you're doing is a
cleanup<00:05:01.120> so<00:05:01.810> it<00:05:02.740> doesn't<00:05:03.010> have<00:05:03.160> to<00:05:03.190> be<00:05:03.570> turning

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
cleanup so it doesn't have to be turning

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.900 
cleanup so it doesn't have to be turning
really<00:05:04.780> fast
