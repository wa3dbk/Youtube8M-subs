00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.980
 but i am borax look i am 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.900
 graduated from the design academy and 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.460
 then first think what you say ok then 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.900
 are you designer 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.430
 because you work with materials i also work 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.440
 not with different materials 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.730
 I only work with textiles 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.169
 is also not that fast at all 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.210
 myself and fashion designs they mention is 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.190
 because I do not purchase fabrics and whole 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.570
 can draw pattern well and therefore from that 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.430
 make clothes but it's more like me 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.830
 want to do the whole research so I stand 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.620
 next to the machine is gares in that sense 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:48.699
 think he wanted me more myself 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.769
 see and mattie and investigations from the 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:52.299
 materials that result from it 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:56.229
 so also for him in those are other 

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:58.360
 topics like what we say whole 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:01.119
 very proud of that but I think 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.699
 the first cycle was just such was it 

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:06.790
 the first time it's kind of 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:08.470
 clearly that actually works without it 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.390
 we really had subsystem 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.450
 that the circle was literally round before 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.640
 our feeling for the first time after 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.869
 inspiration comes from everyday 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.049
 but I think that it is very whole 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.789
 A lot of inspiration also arises and what happens 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.439
 happened the moment we met the 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:25.840
 machine and we are your machines 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:28.119
 are at work 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.200
 for me it is innovating that people 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.520
 very often think that you have something at all 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.810
 have to make news but I think above all 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.880
 that it is watching and and I know 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.560
 because and I know that very much 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.999
 There are such gadgets and I think the 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.619
 even without you maybe super 

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:43.210
 are technical and something completely new 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.799
 could make you would put things up 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.789
 being able to use it in a different way 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.799
 I think that 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:50.920
 see for yourself surprise that does not have any 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:52.899
 to be genious to feel for 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.060
 new fun things to do think that 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.670
 above all just trying everything out 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.650
 Nations 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:03.320
 can try and suddenly arise 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:05.899
 no more i think machines and 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.700
 I am very important at bar upstairs 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.599
 think machines of the part of 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.429
 be the team 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:11.750
 think that moment we with the machine 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.739
 at work that machine also 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.209
 literally work with 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.170
 because we do not know exactly what is there 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.190
 happened the moment the 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.380
 entering different colors 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.060
 different pairs are actually like 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.420
 if something goes wrong then we will learn there again 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.160
 from 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.010
 so i think the machine actually 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.930
 is simply more of a fellow player and that 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.310
 the really cooperate with a machine then 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.310
 that the machine really does things for us 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:46.670
 but now it's basically the basics 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.840
 of the first items of clothing that I 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.670
 always made technology that we have 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.180
 developed from the turning machine 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.860
 and this will all be scarves 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.299
 the patterns you see them over it and 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.769
 what we did today is in the 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.799
 trunk driving machine 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:03.890
 really determined which pattern went into it 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:06.410
 that is the pattern of the scarves that 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.720
 have loaded into the machine 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.750
 afterwards they have the color is for the 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.340
 go to the front and back 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.590
 determine 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.780
 want to knit more parts 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.280
 and also the knitted something 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.650
 is attached with the back and can 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.590
 have the color on the inside 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:29.870
 view if you also cut it 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:34.069
 look and then we see the fluorescent 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:36.290
 can this is the floor and the 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:39.319
 and we have a yellow animal bank 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.630
 today also the colors changed so that 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.730
 we went to see how we can 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.100
 create transitions and how can we 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.860
 by optical mixing 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.630
 so colors the yarns that come in 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.160
 principle very standard red a whole 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.780
 standard yellow a very standard blue 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.730
 from the moment we got it 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.560
 and different compositions 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.940
 together are going to do it again so 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.430
 all different and we will be on 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.650
 what you see you actually see much more 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.930
 colors and other colors than those in 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.290
 first stamp it on the coke and now I go 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.489
 cut a scarf right away and 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.950
 we will eventually go all the way 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.950
 and is for you anyway
