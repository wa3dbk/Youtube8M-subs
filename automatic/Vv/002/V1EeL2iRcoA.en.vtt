in<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.600> 1940s<00:00:46.379> they<00:00:46.590> probably<00:00:46.829> would<00:00:47.010> have

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
in the 1940s they probably would have

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.709 
in the 1940s they probably would have
used<00:00:47.129> leeks<00:00:47.550> more<00:00:47.910> than<00:00:48.030> onions<00:00:48.329> but<00:00:48.539> if<00:00:48.629> you

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
used leeks more than onions but if you

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.299 
used leeks more than onions but if you
grew<00:00:48.899> your<00:00:49.050> own<00:00:49.200> then<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.860> obviously<00:00:49.980> you'd

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
grew your own then you obviously you'd

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.010 
grew your own then you obviously you'd
have<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.489> good<00:00:50.670> supply<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:50.969> onions<00:00:51.449> but

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
have a good supply of onions but

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.110 
have a good supply of onions but
generally<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.620> was<00:00:52.739> easier<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.670> buy<00:00:53.879> leeks

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
generally it was easier to buy leeks

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.930 
generally it was easier to buy leeks
than<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.449> was<00:00:54.570> onions<00:00:54.960> because<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:56.070> haven't<00:00:56.399> got

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
than it was onions because I haven't got

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.689 
than it was onions because I haven't got
any<00:00:57.059> potatoes<00:00:57.930> I've<00:00:58.800> just<00:00:59.010> checked<00:00:59.309> them<00:00:59.489> and

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
any potatoes I've just checked them and

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:00.950 
any potatoes I've just checked them and
I<00:00:59.730> don't<00:00:59.789> think<00:01:00.000> even<00:01:00.390> anybody<00:01:00.600> from<00:01:00.870> the

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
I don't think even anybody from the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.380 
I don't think even anybody from the
1940s<00:01:01.590> would<00:01:02.070> be<00:01:02.190> able<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.460> use<00:01:02.640> my<00:01:02.850> potatoes

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
1940s would be able to use my potatoes

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.310 
1940s would be able to use my potatoes
they<00:01:04.110> are<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:04.949> rubbery<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.600> have<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:07.140> looks

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
they are so rubbery and have it looks

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.719 
they are so rubbery and have it looks
like<00:01:07.470> bean<00:01:07.740> sprouts<00:01:08.189> are<00:01:08.400> stuck<00:01:08.580> all<00:01:08.700> over

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
like bean sprouts are stuck all over

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.429 
like bean sprouts are stuck all over
them<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.270> don't<00:01:09.510> think<00:01:09.810> I'll<00:01:09.990> I'll<00:01:10.229> use

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
them so I don't think I'll I'll use

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.260 
them so I don't think I'll I'll use
those<00:01:10.650> but<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.340> I've<00:01:11.520> used<00:01:11.549> quarter<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.240> a
