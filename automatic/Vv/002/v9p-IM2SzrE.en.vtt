00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.259
 here in two ways and good the first 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.300
 What I am going to tell you is how to improve 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.630
 platinum colonies good from what 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.519
 We will do will be to locate the the the building 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.619
 higher no higher than good is would be 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.619
 this one that is easy to locate and is like 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.300
 a good tower is this is this one 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.580
 good what we will do in this building 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.590
 it will obviously enter and well there will be a 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.539
 sir with two crossed swords or lady 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.480
 or some resident 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:34.020
 you are not in that gentleman better and good 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.040
 this will allow us to improve facing 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:42.460
 a league adapt why 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:45.130
 to objects that have been modified 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.870
 to modify and adapt will charge us 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.120
 platinum coins and good and we 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.190
 will change the object of the hotel adapt and 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.530
 well it would be the way to improve 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.140
 objects of nothing because the objects 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.690
 will have the ones to improve those here in 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.260
 this in this case good the following 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:05.560
 way to improve it will be a bit strange 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.440
 be it like this or the most conventional 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.170
 good would be the warrior and in the elite 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.840
 with musicians with spirits that 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:17.020
 we will get killing leaders show 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.100
 a spirit of him and one 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.979
 we will choose any object that 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.960
 we want and we will press it right click and 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.580
 will let us put the good spirit 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.920
 depends on the type of objects since 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.690
 some let you put one is a kind of 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.259
 game spirit because example there is 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:35.140
 This game a hall and ice and 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.550
 wind and good everyone has their 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.340
 social properties and good some 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:43.140
 some weapons let us put combined 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:46.909
 two good even three but almost 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.909
 the property of fire 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.690
 critical 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.480
 and well that would be practically everything 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.940
 I wanted to go by to say hello to a 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.769
