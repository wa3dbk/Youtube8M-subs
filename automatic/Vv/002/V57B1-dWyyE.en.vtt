00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
been it would have a nice butt would

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.120 
been it would have a nice butt would
split<00:05:50.020> and<00:05:50.229> fold<00:05:50.409> it<00:05:50.530> back<00:05:50.680> but<00:05:50.919> that's<00:05:51.039> a

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.130 
split and fold it back but that's a

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:55.620 
split and fold it back but that's a
little<00:05:51.190> bit<00:05:51.630> advanced<00:05:52.630> for<00:05:52.780> a<00:05:54.300> McDonald's<00:05:55.300> toy

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
little bit advanced for a McDonald's toy

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:01.050 
little bit advanced for a McDonald's toy
so<00:05:56.789> still<00:05:57.789> very<00:05:58.419> cool<00:05:58.750> i<00:05:59.229> like<00:06:00.190> i<00:06:00.430> said<00:06:00.639> to<00:06:00.789> self

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.130 
and ties very show accurate head

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.339 
and ties very show accurate head
actually<00:06:04.090> do<00:06:04.330> kind<00:06:04.690> of<00:06:04.719> like<00:06:04.810> the<00:06:04.960> cockpit

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:05.349 
actually do kind of like the cockpit

actually do kind of like the cockpit
there<00:06:05.530> a<00:06:05.830> little<00:06:06.400> hole<00:06:06.729> right<00:06:06.759> there<00:06:06.969> but

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
there a little hole right there but

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.740 
there a little hole right there but
doesn't<00:06:07.750> really<00:06:07.780> matter<00:06:08.080> plugs<00:06:08.949> are<00:06:09.219> okay

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:09.750 
doesn't really matter plugs are okay

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.029 
doesn't really matter plugs are okay
like<00:06:10.750> I<00:06:10.870> said<00:06:10.930> it<00:06:11.139> doesn't<00:06:11.169> stand<00:06:11.620> very<00:06:11.770> well

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:12.039 
like I said it doesn't stand very well

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:14.490 
like I said it doesn't stand very well
so<00:06:12.310> there<00:06:12.490> is<00:06:12.610> like<00:06:12.940> google<00:06:13.780> thing<00:06:14.289> right

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:14.500 
so there is like google thing right

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.950 
so there is like google thing right
there<00:06:14.909> so<00:06:16.440> both<00:06:17.440> over<00:06:17.710> very<00:06:17.919> easily

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 
there so both over very easily

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.689 
there so both over very easily
articulation<00:06:19.960> is<00:06:20.139> pretty<00:06:20.380> good<00:06:20.530> arm<00:06:21.159> can<00:06:21.490> bend

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:21.699 
articulation is pretty good arm can bend

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:23.480 
articulation is pretty good arm can bend
all<00:06:21.880> the<00:06:21.909> way<00:06:22.060> up<00:06:22.270> and<00:06:22.449> a<00:06:22.539> little<00:06:22.719> bit<00:06:22.900> backward

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.490 
all the way up and a little bit backward

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.029 
all the way up and a little bit backward
that<00:06:24.490> ted<00:06:25.270> has<00:06:25.300> no<00:06:25.599> articulation<00:06:26.139> kind<00:06:26.949> of

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:27.039 
that ted has no articulation kind of

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:31.680 
that ted has no articulation kind of
move<00:06:27.370> up<00:06:27.669> like<00:06:28.330> that<00:06:28.509> as<00:06:29.580> legs<00:06:30.580> can<00:06:31.240> go<00:06:31.389> all<00:06:31.659> the

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:31.690 
move up like that as legs can go all the

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.499 
move up like that as legs can go all the
way<00:06:31.840> back<00:06:31.930> here<00:06:32.169> and<00:06:32.889> stuff<00:06:33.190> so<00:06:33.610> it's<00:06:34.180> not<00:06:34.300> very

00:06:34.499 --> 00:06:34.509 
way back here and stuff so it's not very

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:37.790 
way back here and stuff so it's not very
articulated<00:06:35.259> by<00:06:35.560> still<00:06:36.039> the<00:06:36.610> best<00:06:36.909> figure

articulated by still the best figure
robot<00:06:38.800> mode<00:06:39.039> could<00:06:40.029> do<00:06:40.270> a<00:06:40.300> little<00:06:40.570> bit<00:06:40.690> better

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:40.810 
robot mode could do a little bit better

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.080 
robot mode could do a little bit better
so<00:06:41.229> at<00:06:41.320> least<00:06:41.500> not
