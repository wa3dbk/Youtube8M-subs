so these hog riders are taken out every
single<00:01:12.759> defense<00:01:13.329> I<00:01:14.220> don't<00:01:15.220> even<00:01:15.310> know<00:01:15.630> there's

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
single defense I don't even know there's

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.219 
single defense I don't even know there's
two<00:01:16.990> Tesla's<00:01:17.470> left<00:01:18.570> so<00:01:19.570> they<00:01:19.750> just<00:01:19.899> took<00:01:20.049> out

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
two Tesla's left so they just took out

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.859 
two Tesla's left so they just took out
that<00:01:20.409> entire<00:01:21.270> basis<00:01:22.270> defense<00:01:23.610> that's<00:01:24.869> that's

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
that entire basis defense that's that's

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.060 
that entire basis defense that's that's
pretty<00:01:26.140> insane<00:01:27.840> now<00:01:28.840> it<00:01:29.170> was<00:01:29.289> only<00:01:29.500> it<00:01:29.920> only

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
pretty insane now it was only it only

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.160 
pretty insane now it was only it only
had<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.490> level<00:01:30.729> one<00:01:30.880> expose<00:01:31.420> did<00:01:31.750> have<00:01:31.869> three

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
had the level one expose did have three

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.649 
had the level one expose did have three
of<00:01:32.259> them<00:01:32.380> though<00:01:32.939> level<00:01:33.939> six<00:01:34.149> mortars<00:01:34.509> and

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
of them though level six mortars and

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.240 
of them though level six mortars and
stuff<00:01:34.899> I<00:01:35.170> don't<00:01:35.439> know<00:01:35.500> how<00:01:35.619> it<00:01:35.770> work<00:01:36.039> on

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
stuff I don't know how it work on

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.940 
stuff I don't know how it work on
Inferno<00:01:36.640> tower<00:01:36.909> bases<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:39.490> could<00:01:39.729> still<00:01:39.970> work

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
Inferno tower bases it could still work

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.779 
Inferno tower bases it could still work
I'd<00:01:41.950> be<00:01:42.159> interested<00:01:42.310> to<00:01:42.580> see<00:01:42.789> it<00:01:44.789> I'll

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
I'd be interested to see it I'll

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:49.230 
I'd be interested to see it I'll
probably<00:01:46.119> do<00:01:46.360> one<00:01:46.509> of<00:01:46.630> those<00:01:46.750> for<00:01:47.939> this<00:01:48.939> base

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
probably do one of those for this base

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.820 
probably do one of those for this base
had<00:01:49.450> good<00:01:49.630> resources<00:01:50.259> and<00:01:50.380> I<00:01:50.439> thought<00:01:50.590> I<00:01:50.649> was<00:01:50.799> a

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
had good resources and I thought I was a

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.969 
had good resources and I thought I was a
good<00:01:51.009> base<00:01:51.220> to<00:01:51.250> test<00:01:51.610> it<00:01:51.789> on<00:01:54.030> so<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:56.200> was<00:01:56.349> that

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
good base to test it on so that was that

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.499 
good base to test it on so that was that
was<00:01:57.130> pretty<00:01:57.159> awesome<00:01:57.729> I<00:01:57.880> did<00:01:58.090> really<00:01:58.270> didn't

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
was pretty awesome I did really didn't

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.639 
was pretty awesome I did really didn't
think<00:01:58.689> it<00:01:58.810> was<00:01:58.899> gonna<00:01:59.080> be<00:01:59.189> that<00:02:00.189> great<00:02:01.649> but

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
think it was gonna be that great but

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:04.380 
think it was gonna be that great but
they<00:02:02.770> just<00:02:02.950> tore<00:02:03.220> through<00:02:03.640> the<00:02:03.759> base<00:02:03.939> even

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
they just tore through the base even

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.240 
they just tore through the base even
with<00:02:04.539> the<00:02:04.750> heroes<00:02:05.380> attacking<00:02:05.890> them<00:02:06.009> the<00:02:06.130> whole

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
with the heroes attacking them the whole

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.180 
with the heroes attacking them the whole
way<00:02:06.280> and<00:02:06.990> just<00:02:07.990> took<00:02:08.830> everything<00:02:10.680> so<00:02:11.680> that<00:02:12.010> was

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
way and just took everything so that was

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.509 
way and just took everything so that was
um<00:02:12.519> that<00:02:13.350> was<00:02:14.350> one<00:02:14.590> of<00:02:14.709> the<00:02:14.799> easier<00:02:15.160> three

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
um that was one of the easier three

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.199 
um that was one of the easier three

enjoyed that and the best part is pretty
much<00:02:24.880> every<00:02:25.209> troop<00:02:25.480> I<00:02:25.600> used<00:02:25.900> is<00:02:26.140> still<00:02:26.350> alive

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
much every troop I used is still alive

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:29.550 
much every troop I used is still alive
because<00:02:28.329> there<00:02:28.569> were<00:02:28.660> no<00:02:28.810> defenses<00:02:29.380> back

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
because there were no defenses back

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:37.680 
because there were no defenses back
there<00:02:32.160> so<00:02:33.160> that's<00:02:33.519> a<00:02:33.640> 3<00:02:33.850> star<00:02:35.940> 3<00:02:36.940> star<00:02:36.970> 28

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
there so that's a 3 star 3 star 28

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.660 
there so that's a 3 star 3 star 28
trophies<00:02:38.200> and<00:02:39.840> pretty<00:02:40.840> decent<00:02:41.290> loot<00:02:41.670> new

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
trophies and pretty decent loot new

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.640 
trophies and pretty decent loot new
crystal<00:02:43.150> 2<00:02:43.299> bonus<00:02:43.690> thirty<00:02:43.989> four<00:02:44.260> thousand

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
crystal 2 bonus thirty four thousand

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.370 
crystal 2 bonus thirty four thousand
thirty<00:02:44.880> 4100<00:02:45.880> I<00:02:46.060> think<00:02:46.720> that<00:02:46.930> came<00:02:47.139> up<00:02:47.260> from

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
thirty 4100 I think that came up from

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.259 
thirty 4100 I think that came up from
nineteen<00:02:47.829> thousand<00:02:48.280> nineteen<00:02:48.639> thousand<00:02:49.180> and

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
nineteen thousand nineteen thousand and

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.840 
nineteen thousand nineteen thousand and
one<00:02:49.420> hundred<00:02:50.040> so<00:02:51.040> that's<00:02:51.190> pretty<00:02:51.400> big<00:02:51.489> it's<00:02:51.819> a

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
one hundred so that's pretty big it's a

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.559 
one hundred so that's pretty big it's a
big<00:02:51.880> change<00:02:52.290> there's<00:02:53.290> also<00:02:54.209> some<00:02:55.209> other<00:02:55.299> cool

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
big change there's also some other cool

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.000 
big change there's also some other cool
changes<00:02:56.019> I<00:02:56.079> haven't<00:02:56.319> really<00:02:56.500> looked<00:02:56.620> at<00:02:56.769> the

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
taking out one Expo so I thought that it
