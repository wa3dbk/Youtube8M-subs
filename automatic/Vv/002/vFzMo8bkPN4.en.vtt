00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:09.010
There is a lot of confusion amongst believers
about Whom to pray to, whether to pray to

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:21.679
Jesus or to God The Father, which Name to
use, Jesus, Yeshua or Yahshua and through

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:30.429
all this confusion people never get to know
the One in whom they believe.

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:38.879
The reason for this confusion is that people
do not know the One in whom they believe.

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:50.829
They are praying into a vacuum but Paul said:"I
KNOW the ONE in whom I have believed."

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:52.520
Why was that?

00:00:52.520 --> 00:01:00.350
It was because JESUS revealed Himself to him
and he said: "Who are You LORD?"

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:08.030
He said:"I am JESUS whom you are persecuting."

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.230
Most believers do not know the One in whom
they believe.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:19.590
Jesus said that:"My Sheep listen to My voice
and they follow Me."

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:27.659
How can you FOLLOW JESUS if you don’t know
His voice?

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.740
If you don’t know Him?

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.050
JESUS CHRIST is LORD.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.159
He is the Way and the Truth and the Life.

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.590
Jesus and The Father are One.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:51.539
God is not divided, but He who does not have
the SON does not have the Father either.

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.549
If you do not have JESUS, you don’t have
nothing.

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:01.280
If you don’t know Jesus, you don’t have
salvation because He will say to many in that

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:08.220
day:"Go away I never knew you, you who work
unrighteousness."

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:18.220
It is JESUS who takes away your sin if you
fall on your knees before HIM and you REPENT.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:27.570
It is JESUS who answers your prayers, if He
is your LORD and your MASTER but most people

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.350
do not pray.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:37.870
Their prayers are not answered because they
do not know the One in whom they believe.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.870
Do you know your LORD?

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.660
Do you know His voice?

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.490
Do you listen to Him, do you follow Him?

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.420
Or do you not know in whom you believe?

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.910
If you cry out to JESUS, He will answer you.

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:06.030
If you seek Him with all your heart, He will
reveal Himself to you and you will know whom

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.650
to pray to.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:14.170
You will know the One in whom you have believed.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:22.650
Have you MET JESUS CHRIST, KING of kings and
LORD of lords.

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.500
It is time to get to know the LORD.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.700
May Jesus bless you.
