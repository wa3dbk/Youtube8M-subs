know<00:00:34.170> when<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.640> the<00:00:35.640> only<00:00:35.760> thing<00:00:35.910> that's

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
know when and the only thing that's

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.180 
know when and the only thing that's
faster<00:00:36.719> than<00:00:36.750> his<00:00:37.020> complex<00:00:37.440> motor<00:00:37.710> skill<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.160> a

faster than his complex motor skill is a

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.000 
faster than his complex motor skill is a
primal<00:00:38.640> response<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.480> that<00:00:39.590> is<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.710> flinch

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
primal response and that is the flinch

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.529 
primal response and that is the flinch
how<00:00:41.340> do<00:00:41.399> we<00:00:41.520> know<00:00:41.730> this<00:00:42.920> forensics<00:00:44.539> when

how do we know this forensics when

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.990 
how do we know this forensics when
somebody<00:00:46.050> gets<00:00:46.590> slashed<00:00:47.070> in<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.579> frontal

got good news and bad news with that we

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.380 
got good news and bad news with that we
always<00:01:05.309> tell<00:01:05.549> people<00:01:05.700> good<00:01:05.970> news<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.270> the

always tell people good news is the

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.570 
always tell people good news is the
flinch<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.750> faster<00:01:07.110> than<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.260> speeding<00:01:07.350> bullet

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
flinch is faster than a speeding bullet

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.460 
flinch is faster than a speeding bullet
the<00:01:08.580> bad<00:01:08.760> news<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.600> doesn't<00:01:09.960> stop<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.260> bullet

the bad news it doesn't stop the bullet
okay<00:01:11.119> but<00:01:12.119> let's<00:01:12.299> take<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.600> over<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.840> fighting

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
okay but let's take it over the fighting

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.929 
okay but let's take it over the fighting
realm<00:01:13.380> car<00:01:14.070> accident<00:01:14.580> someone<00:01:14.790> goes<00:01:14.909> through

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
realm car accident someone goes through

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.570 
realm car accident someone goes through
a<00:01:15.150> windshield<00:01:15.590> no<00:01:16.590> seat<00:01:16.860> belt<00:01:17.070> where's<00:01:17.430> their

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
a windshield no seat belt where's their

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.560 
a windshield no seat belt where's their
trauma<00:01:18.590> hands<00:01:19.590> again<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:20.759> what<00:01:20.970> we<00:01:21.119> looked<00:01:21.390> at

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
trauma hands again so what we looked at

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.920 
trauma hands again so what we looked at
from<00:01:22.259> this<00:01:22.500> event<00:01:22.799> in<00:01:23.250> 1988<00:01:24.000> was<00:01:24.270> this<00:01:24.420> concept

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
from this event in 1988 was this concept

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.510 
from this event in 1988 was this concept
that<00:01:25.020> this<00:01:25.229> flinch<00:01:25.560> mechanism<00:01:26.159> was<00:01:26.280> way

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
that this flinch mechanism was way

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.880 
that this flinch mechanism was way
faster<00:01:27.060> than<00:01:27.409> anything<00:01:28.409> conscious<00:01:28.770> newer

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
faster than anything conscious newer

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.649 
faster than anything conscious newer
muscular<00:01:29.280> communication<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.030> slower<00:01:30.420> than

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
muscular communication is slower than

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.690 
muscular communication is slower than
unconscious<00:01:31.409> neuromuscular<00:01:32.070> communication

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
unconscious neuromuscular communication

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.450 
unconscious neuromuscular communication
what<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.479> means<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.869> this<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.860> if<00:01:35.159> Tony

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
what that means is this that if Tony

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.130 
what that means is this that if Tony
does<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.700> slow<00:01:36.030> haymaker<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:36.780> got<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.020> go<00:01:37.110> oh

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
does a slow haymaker and I got to go oh

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.899 
does a slow haymaker and I got to go oh
that's<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.560> right<00:01:37.799> hand<00:01:38.040> haymaker<00:01:38.460> I'm<00:01:38.700> going

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
that's a right hand haymaker I'm going

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.340 
that's a right hand haymaker I'm going
to<00:01:39.000> do<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.090> rising<00:01:39.540> block<00:01:39.689> with<00:01:39.900> my<00:01:40.020> left<00:01:40.229> hand

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
to do a rising block with my left hand

move but what is my margin for error if

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.050 
move but what is my margin for error if
I'm<00:01:52.380> intercepting<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.159> complex<00:01:53.579> motor<00:01:53.790> skill

I'm intercepting a complex motor skill

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.690 
I'm intercepting a complex motor skill
with<00:01:54.210> another<00:01:54.450> complex<00:01:54.810> motor<00:01:55.079> skill<00:01:55.700> zero

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
with another complex motor skill zero

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.840 
with another complex motor skill zero
because<00:01:57.659> if<00:01:57.930> I'm<00:01:58.079> early<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:59.130> looks<00:01:59.399> like<00:01:59.460> this

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
because if I'm early it looks like this

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.100 
because if I'm early it looks like this
and<00:02:01.219> I<00:02:02.219> go<00:02:02.369> how<00:02:02.549> is<00:02:02.700> faster<00:02:03.060> than<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.360> but<00:02:04.049> I

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
and I go how is faster than you but I

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.089 
and I go how is faster than you but I
get<00:02:04.320> hit<00:02:04.530> right<00:02:05.390> if<00:02:06.390> I'm<00:02:07.229> late<00:02:07.469> it<00:02:07.770> looks<00:02:08.039> like

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
get hit right if I'm late it looks like

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.949 
get hit right if I'm late it looks like
this<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.760> if<00:02:11.760> I<00:02:11.910> have<00:02:12.120> perfect<00:02:12.750> timing

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
this and if I have perfect timing

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.910 
this and if I have perfect timing
it<00:02:13.440> looks<00:02:13.680> like

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
it looks like

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.850 
it looks like
this<00:02:16.250> so<00:02:17.250> in<00:02:17.550> a<00:02:17.700> complex<00:02:18.180> motor<00:02:18.480> skill<00:02:18.870> I<00:02:19.080> need

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
this so in a complex motor skill I need

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.160 
this so in a complex motor skill I need
to<00:02:19.980> have<00:02:20.069> exact<00:02:20.550> timing<00:02:21.030> on<00:02:21.180> a<00:02:21.239> primal<00:02:21.959> gross

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
to have exact timing on a primal gross

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.979 
to have exact timing on a primal gross
motor<00:02:22.410> skill<00:02:22.800> I<00:02:22.950> don't<00:02:23.220> need<00:02:23.370> exact<00:02:23.760> timing<00:02:24.150> in

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
motor skill I don't need exact timing in

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.839 
motor skill I don't need exact timing in

starts the fight and what we don't build

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.099 
starts the fight and what we don't build
into<00:03:16.980> is<00:03:17.190> that<00:03:17.700> first<00:03:18.000> two<00:03:18.269> seconds<00:03:18.840> of<00:03:18.959> oh

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
into is that first two seconds of oh

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.310 
into is that first two seconds of oh
 when<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:21.000> body<00:03:21.209> starts<00:03:21.390> to<00:03:21.690> do<00:03:21.900> this<00:03:22.079> and

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
 when the body starts to do this and

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.670 
 when the body starts to do this and
move<00:03:22.440> and<00:03:22.709> move<00:03:22.920> away<00:03:23.329> okay<00:03:24.329> so<00:03:24.810> so<00:03:25.320> here<00:03:25.560> we

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
move and move away okay so so here we

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.039 
move and move away okay so so here we
are<00:03:26.150> let's<00:03:27.150> add<00:03:27.269> a<00:03:27.299> little<00:03:27.480> physics<00:03:27.930> and

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
are let's add a little physics and

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.259 
are let's add a little physics and
science<00:03:28.260> to<00:03:28.560> this<00:03:28.650> action<00:03:29.220> versus<00:03:29.609> reaction

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
science to this action versus reaction

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.680 
science to this action versus reaction
it's<00:03:31.170> a<00:03:31.230> scientific<00:03:31.590> measure<00:03:32.060> right<00:03:33.060> what's

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
it's a scientific measure right what's

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.680 
it's a scientific measure right what's
faster<00:03:33.959> action<00:03:34.350> or<00:03:34.650> reaction<00:03:35.239> who's<00:03:36.239> the<00:03:36.510> bad

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
faster action or reaction who's the bad

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.099 
faster action or reaction who's the bad
guy<00:03:36.720> action<00:03:37.380> or<00:03:37.980> reaction<00:03:38.390> action<00:03:39.390> so<00:03:39.930> we<00:03:40.019> have

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
guy action or reaction action so we have

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:41.930 
guy action or reaction action so we have
all<00:03:40.230> these<00:03:40.380> goofy<00:03:41.040> martial<00:03:41.430> art<00:03:41.579> moves<00:03:41.790> and

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
all these goofy martial art moves and

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:42.979 
all these goofy martial art moves and
I'm<00:03:42.000> a<00:03:42.060> martial<00:03:42.390> artists<00:03:42.660> I<00:03:42.690> don't<00:03:42.840> mean<00:03:42.930> to

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
I'm a martial artists I don't mean to

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.830 
I'm a martial artists I don't mean to
put<00:03:43.140> down<00:03:43.290> martial<00:03:43.680> arts<00:03:44.060> okay<00:03:45.060> I<00:03:45.269> just<00:03:45.630> I've

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
put down martial arts okay I just I've

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.479 
put down martial arts okay I just I've
been<00:03:46.019> punched<00:03:46.290> in<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.650> face<00:03:46.799> because<00:03:47.040> I<00:03:47.250> tried

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
been punched in the face because I tried

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.479 
been punched in the face because I tried
to<00:03:47.640> do<00:03:47.760> a<00:03:47.790> wax<00:03:48.150> on<00:03:48.390> wax<00:03:48.420> off<00:03:48.900> so<00:03:49.590> I<00:03:49.620> this<00:03:50.370> is

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
to do a wax on wax off so I this is

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.849 
to do a wax on wax off so I this is
empirical<00:03:51.090> it's<00:03:51.209> not<00:03:51.359> theoretical<00:03:51.930> so<00:03:52.530> if

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
empirical it's not theoretical so if

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.910 
empirical it's not theoretical so if
action<00:03:53.640> is<00:03:53.850> faster<00:03:54.450> than<00:03:54.480> reaction<00:03:55.260> and<00:03:55.410> the

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
action is faster than reaction and the

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.520 
action is faster than reaction and the
sucker<00:03:56.160> puncher<00:03:56.640> is<00:03:56.819> the<00:03:56.970> action<00:03:57.450> then<00:03:58.319> does

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
sucker puncher is the action then does

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.860 
sucker puncher is the action then does
it<00:03:58.650> make<00:03:58.769> any<00:03:58.920> sense<00:03:59.010> to<00:03:59.489> have<00:03:59.790> a<00:04:00.120> complex

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
it make any sense to have a complex

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.199 
it make any sense to have a complex
motor<00:04:01.170> skill<00:04:01.500> response<00:04:02.160> it<00:04:02.700> doesn't<00:04:03.120> even

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
motor skill response it doesn't even

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.199 
motor skill response it doesn't even
make<00:04:03.390> any<00:04:03.450> sense<00:04:03.660> so<00:04:04.650> what<00:04:05.130> we<00:04:05.340> know<00:04:05.640> from

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
make any sense so what we know from

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.390 
make any sense so what we know from
forensic<00:04:06.840> studies<00:04:07.230> and<00:04:07.440> studies<00:04:07.590> of<00:04:08.010> startled

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
forensic studies and studies of startled

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.390 
forensic studies and studies of startled
flinch<00:04:08.640> is<00:04:08.880> that<00:04:09.600> the<00:04:10.139> flinch<00:04:10.650> is<00:04:10.859> triggered<00:04:11.310> I

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
flinch is that the flinch is triggered I

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.830 
flinch is that the flinch is triggered I
listen<00:04:11.670> to<00:04:11.760> this<00:04:11.880> by<00:04:12.480> visual<00:04:13.109> tactile<00:04:14.069> and

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
listen to this by visual tactile and

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.420 
listen to this by visual tactile and
auditory<00:04:15.840> cues<00:04:17.389> okay<00:04:18.389> so<00:04:19.049> if<00:04:19.380> I<00:04:19.739> see<00:04:20.160> him

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
auditory cues okay so if I see him

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.760 
auditory cues okay so if I see him
starting<00:04:21.060> to<00:04:21.120> throw<00:04:21.479> a<00:04:21.510> punch<00:04:21.810> that<00:04:22.560> will

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
starting to throw a punch that will

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.010 
starting to throw a punch that will
trigger<00:04:23.039> the<00:04:23.190> flinch<00:04:23.659> but<00:04:24.659> that<00:04:24.840> won't

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
trigger the flinch but that won't

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.990 
trigger the flinch but that won't
trigger<00:04:25.289> my<00:04:25.530> block<00:04:25.890> because<00:04:26.430> of<00:04:26.729> the<00:04:26.820> way<00:04:26.970> we

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
trigger my block because of the way we

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.770 
trigger my block because of the way we
practice

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
practice

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.170 
practice
blocking<00:04:28.230> and<00:04:28.380> countering<00:04:28.860> gun<00:04:29.460> knife<00:04:29.760> stuff

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
blocking and countering gun knife stuff

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.720 
blocking and countering gun knife stuff
and<00:04:30.389> so<00:04:30.540> on<00:04:30.690> and<00:04:30.810> so<00:04:30.870> forth<00:04:31.010> when<00:04:32.010> you<00:04:32.160> practice

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
and so on and so forth when you practice

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.160 
and so on and so forth when you practice
in<00:04:32.910> your<00:04:33.180> martial<00:04:33.570> arts<00:04:33.780> school<00:04:33.990> in<00:04:34.020> your

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170 
in your martial arts school in your

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.379 
in your martial arts school in your
boxing<00:04:34.590> gym<00:04:34.800> you<00:04:34.950> academy<00:04:35.430> what<00:04:35.820> stands<00:04:36.180> when

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
boxing gym you academy what stands when

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:37.580 
boxing gym you academy what stands when
you're<00:04:36.480> practicing<00:04:36.630> defense<00:04:37.230> against<00:04:37.500> a

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
you're practicing defense against a

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.260 
you're practicing defense against a
right<00:04:37.800> hand<00:04:38.040> to<00:04:38.190> the<00:04:38.280> face<00:04:38.460> what<00:04:38.820> stands<00:04:39.120> for

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
right hand to the face what stands for

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.610 
right hand to the face what stands for
you<00:04:39.330> it<00:04:39.450> but<00:04:39.690> the<00:04:39.780> point<00:04:39.960> I'm<00:04:40.139> making<00:04:40.169> here<00:04:40.500> is

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
you it but the point I'm making here is

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.409 
you it but the point I'm making here is
this<00:04:40.860> is<00:04:41.010> when<00:04:41.160> we<00:04:41.250> learn<00:04:41.460> how<00:04:41.669> to<00:04:41.730> punch

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
this is when we learn how to punch

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.629 
this is when we learn how to punch
encounter<00:04:43.020> aren't<00:04:43.530> we<00:04:43.560> in<00:04:43.740> fighting<00:04:44.220> stances

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
encounter aren't we in fighting stances

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:47.629 
encounter aren't we in fighting stances
well<00:04:45.600> what<00:04:45.780> this<00:04:45.990> does<00:04:46.230> is<00:04:46.410> this<00:04:46.860> negates<00:04:47.370> the

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
well what this does is this negates the

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:49.460 
well what this does is this negates the
development<00:04:48.360> the<00:04:48.540> true<00:04:48.750> development<00:04:49.350> of

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
development the true development of

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.520 
development the true development of
pre-contact<00:04:50.040> q<00:04:50.250> awareness<00:04:51.380> how<00:04:52.380> ridiculous

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
pre-contact q awareness how ridiculous

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.440 
pre-contact q awareness how ridiculous
would<00:04:53.040> this<00:04:53.160> be<00:04:53.370> it<00:04:53.520> there's<00:04:53.760> the<00:04:53.910> suspects<00:04:54.330> he

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
would this be it there's the suspects he

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:55.700 
would this be it there's the suspects he
gets<00:04:54.600> out<00:04:54.720> of<00:04:54.810> his<00:04:54.870> car<00:04:54.930> and<00:04:55.139> he's<00:04:55.260> in<00:04:55.320> a<00:04:55.380> boxing

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
gets out of his car and he's in a boxing

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.170 
gets out of his car and he's in a boxing
stance<00:04:55.889> and<00:04:56.160> I<00:04:56.190> walk<00:04:56.370> up<00:04:56.400> and<00:04:56.639> I<00:04:56.700> go<00:04:56.820> well<00:04:56.940> what

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
stance and I walk up and I go well what

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.120 
stance and I walk up and I go well what
do<00:04:57.240> we<00:04:57.300> got<00:04:57.450> here<00:04:57.480> your<00:04:58.350> sir<00:04:58.889> you're<00:04:59.100> under

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
arrest you know you would never do that

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.110 
arrest you know you would never do that
right<00:05:01.290> but<00:05:01.890> you<00:05:02.040> might<00:05:02.250> walk<00:05:02.460> up<00:05:02.700> and<00:05:02.850> this<00:05:02.940> guy

is thinking about sucker punching you
you<00:05:04.710> have<00:05:04.800> no<00:05:04.950> idea<00:05:05.190> because<00:05:05.580> you<00:05:05.790> don't<00:05:05.940> hear

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
you have no idea because you don't hear

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.330 
you have no idea because you don't hear
the<00:05:06.150> clown<00:05:06.330> music<00:05:06.690> and<00:05:06.870> he's<00:05:07.860> just<00:05:08.070> standing
