00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:19.180
 volume down button that is here and 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.940

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.370
 as it says here 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.839
 now now since we have that if 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.539

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:42.040

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:47.090
 volume until it appears 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:49.250
 and now that when we have to review it 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:54.010
 and press the volume up button 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.010
 up to confirm your selection 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.440
 and now let's hope ok now in that in 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.330
 this screen that we want in which 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.449
 we want to press the two he should go up 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:07.450
 and download one at the same time 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.789
 ok so now we are in the mode of 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.219
 Android recovery and here what 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:14.320
 we want to do is select the third 

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:16.810
 option that says white thereafter western 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.090
 we're just going to navigate with the best button 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.250
 to lower volume until we have that 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.679
 there and press the button in tracking 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.110
 to select we lower again a 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:27.950
 once more they say that if you erase all 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.440
 the user data 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.250
 and turn on to confirm 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.250
 now let's wait 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.360
 this should take as a maximum 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.360
 minute in this process 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.910
 although the data is now finished, now 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.910
 beginning the crash 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.810
 but it ends and it's now completed now 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.780
 we can start the system and that's what 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.540
 that is complete that is the good everything 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.390
 from the factory recipe it seems phone already 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.450

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:44.220
