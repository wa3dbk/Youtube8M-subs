terminals<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.800> I<00:00:25.800> thought<00:00:26.010> was<00:00:26.279> at<00:00:27.240> 3<00:00:27.720> pounds

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109

29<00:00:28.740> which<00:00:29.039> roughly<00:00:29.760> about<00:00:30.260> $4<00:00:31.260> 50<00:00:31.740> less<00:00:32.099> than<00:00:32.279> 5

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
29 which roughly about $4 50 less than 5

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.880 
29 which roughly about $4 50 less than 5
bucks<00:00:32.820> anyway<00:00:33.350> including<00:00:34.350> shipping<00:00:34.800> a

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
bucks anyway including shipping a

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.970 
bucks anyway including shipping a
thought<00:00:35.750> that's<00:00:36.750> worth<00:00:37.170> buying<00:00:37.469> just<00:00:37.739> take

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
thought that's worth buying just take

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.619 
thought that's worth buying just take
the<00:00:38.129> bits<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.550> see<00:00:38.760> what<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.000> court<00:00:39.239> is<00:00:39.420> like

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
the bits and see what the court is like

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.900 
the bits and see what the court is like
and<00:00:39.899> after<00:00:40.500> I<00:00:40.680> wasn't<00:00:40.980> really<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.640> wasn't

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
and after I wasn't really I wasn't

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.850 
and after I wasn't really I wasn't
expecting<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.750> quality<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.200> be<00:00:43.230> good<00:00:43.500> because

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
expecting the quality to be good because

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.069 
expecting the quality to be good because
I<00:00:44.670> thought<00:00:45.149> it's<00:00:45.329> going<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.510> be<00:00:45.600> very<00:00:45.809> similar

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
I thought it's going to be very similar

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.880 
I thought it's going to be very similar
to<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.440> cheap<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:47.809> USB<00:00:48.809> taper<00:00:49.500> supplies

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
to the cheap and USB taper supplies

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.619 
to the cheap and USB taper supplies
where<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.399> secretary<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:50.940> like<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.270> smallest

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
where the secretary is like the smallest

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.689 
where the secretary is like the smallest
chance<00:00:51.930> for<00:00:52.199> more<00:00:52.320> possible<00:00:52.739> really<00:00:53.520> bad

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
chance for more possible really bad

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:00.020 
chance for more possible really bad
insulation<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.629> no<00:00:54.840> filtering<00:00:55.820> and<00:00:58.399> just<00:00:59.399> you

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
insulation is no filtering and just you

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.170 
insulation is no filtering and just you
know<00:01:00.059> no<00:01:01.050> proper<00:01:01.469> feedback<00:01:01.710> circuitry<00:01:02.430> so<00:01:02.879> I

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
know no proper feedback circuitry so I

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.780 
know no proper feedback circuitry so I
bought<00:01:03.570> one<00:01:03.600> anyway<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.049> let's<00:01:04.890> take<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.700> to

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
bought one anyway and let's take it to

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.670 
bought one anyway and let's take it to
bits<00:01:05.970> but<00:01:06.240> initially<00:01:06.900> I'll<00:01:06.990> say<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.170> did<00:01:07.350> an

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
bits but initially I'll say I did an

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.100 
bits but initially I'll say I did an
insulation<00:01:08.070> test<00:01:08.520> between<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.030> main<00:01:09.720> side

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
insulation test between the main side

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.310 
insulation test between the main side
and<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.860> low-voltage<00:01:11.159> side<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.720> came<00:01:12.990> out

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
and the low-voltage side and it came out

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.780 
and the low-voltage side and it came out
at<00:01:14.030> 595<00:01:15.030> mega<00:01:15.390> ohms<00:01:15.570> at<00:01:15.840> 1<00:01:16.170> kV<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.220> that's

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
at 595 mega ohms at 1 kV and that's

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.910 
at 595 mega ohms at 1 kV and that's
that's<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.570> good<00:01:18.750> that's<00:01:18.990> quite<00:01:19.409> acceptable

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
that's a good that's quite acceptable

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.789 
that's a good that's quite acceptable
for<00:01:20.009> isolation<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.270> let<00:01:21.420> her<00:01:21.630> cut<00:01:22.409> this<00:01:22.560> for

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
for isolation so let her cut this for

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:44.940 
for isolation so let her cut this for
warranty<00:01:23.220> seal<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.700> that's<00:01:24.090> possible

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:52.800 

secrets<00:01:45.340> cruise

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.620

oh it's a cover off let's see we get the

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
oh it's a cover off let's see we get the

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
you're running LEDs off it which i think

your<00:05:46.640> LEDs<00:05:47.060> and<00:05:47.270> just<00:05:47.390> nudge<00:05:47.600> the<00:05:47.750> brightness

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:02.660 
I'm surprised I'm surprised the

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.900 
I'm surprised I'm surprised the

supply<00:06:06.830> that<00:06:06.980> you<00:06:07.040> do<00:06:07.310> and<00:06:07.960> it<00:06:08.960> does<00:06:09.170> appear<00:06:09.320> to

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:09.650 
supply that you do and it does appear to

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.970 
supply that you do and it does appear to
be<00:06:09.830> quite<00:06:10.010> well<00:06:10.100> soldered<00:06:10.930> it<00:06:11.930> appears<00:06:12.860> to

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:17.710 
be quite well soldered it appears to
have<00:06:13.070> proper<00:06:13.520> feedback<00:06:13.790> circuitry<00:06:14.919> just<00:06:16.720> the

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:17.720 
have proper feedback circuitry just the

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.620 
have proper feedback circuitry just the
why<00:06:17.870> is<00:06:17.930> it<00:06:18.169> so<00:06:18.350> cheap<00:06:18.590> I<00:06:19.240> mean<00:06:20.240> it<00:06:20.360> didn't

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:20.630 
why is it so cheap I mean it didn't

explode<00:06:21.110> on<00:06:21.290> a<00:06:21.380> plugin<00:06:21.890> is<00:06:22.640> that<00:06:23.090> just<00:06:23.270> because

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:23.600 
explode on a plugin is that just because

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.840 
explode on a plugin is that just because
I'm<00:06:23.780> it's<00:06:24.290> a<00:06:24.530> really<00:06:24.830> mass-produced<00:06:25.550> device

that they can keep the cross title I

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.670 
that they can keep the cross title I
don't<00:06:28.820> know<00:06:28.910> but<00:06:29.300> as<00:06:29.540> so<00:06:29.960> you<00:06:30.320> know<00:06:30.410> I<00:06:30.470> were

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:30.680 
don't know but as so you know I were

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.890 
don't know but as so you know I were
delayed<00:06:30.890> for<00:06:31.070> LEDs<00:06:31.490> I<00:06:32.980> wouldn't<00:06:34.390> really<00:06:35.390> be

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:35.900 
delayed for LEDs I wouldn't really be

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.920
