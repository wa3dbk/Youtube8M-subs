the<00:00:09.750> shooter<00:00:10.230> space<00:00:10.469> is<00:00:10.590> very<00:00:10.679> crowded<00:00:10.950> and<00:00:11.160> we

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
the shooter space is very crowded and we

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.709 
the shooter space is very crowded and we
needed<00:00:11.400> to<00:00:11.490> find<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.820> unique<00:00:12.030> take<00:00:12.240> on<00:00:12.360> it<00:00:12.540> so<00:00:12.630> we

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
needed to find a unique take on it so we

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.289 
needed to find a unique take on it so we
have<00:00:12.809> this<00:00:12.960> third<00:00:13.200> person<00:00:13.710> a<00:00:14.120> tactical<00:00:15.120> game

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
have this third person a tactical game

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.359 
have this third person a tactical game
that's<00:00:15.719> cover-based<00:00:16.080> that<00:00:17.039> really<00:00:17.250> gives

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
that's cover-based that really gives

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.310 
that's cover-based that really gives
unique<00:00:17.789> gameplay<00:00:18.029> field<00:00:18.480> where<00:00:18.990> two<00:00:19.140> teams

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
unique gameplay field where two teams

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.200

kind<00:00:19.650> of<00:00:19.710> square<00:00:20.189> off<00:00:20.340> against<00:00:20.670> each<00:00:20.760> other<00:00:20.970> on

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
kind of square off against each other on

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.500 
kind of square off against each other on
front<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.920> second<00:00:23.340> is<00:00:23.490> that<00:00:24.210> we<00:00:24.300> knew<00:00:24.390> we

front and the second is that we knew we

front and the second is that we knew we
had<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.660> break<00:00:24.869> down<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.080> few<00:00:25.289> barriers<00:00:25.590> in<00:00:25.830> the

that's<00:00:31.529> triple-a<00:00:32.009> that's<00:00:32.309> unique<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.880> that

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
that's triple-a that's unique and that

is dedicated to the PC so one of the
things<00:00:35.610> we<00:00:35.880> realize<00:00:36.210> with<00:00:36.390> shooters<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.780> that

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
things we realize with shooters is that

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.450 
things we realize with shooters is that
playing<00:00:37.170> for<00:00:37.410> example<00:00:37.739> in<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.890> clam<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.309> lot

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
playing for example in a clam is a lot

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.400 
playing for example in a clam is a lot
of<00:00:38.550> fun<00:00:38.700> but<00:00:39.390> it's<00:00:39.510> fundamentally<00:00:40.020> very<00:00:40.230> kind

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
of fun but it's fundamentally very kind

of fun but it's fundamentally very kind
of<00:00:40.469> hard<00:00:40.649> core<00:00:40.860> activity<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.280> have<00:00:41.399> to

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
of hard core activity you have to

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.400 
of hard core activity you have to
dedicate<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:42.059> lot<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.390> time<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.930> practicing

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
dedicate a lot of time to practicing

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.619 
dedicate a lot of time to practicing
together<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:44.040> being<00:00:44.219> very<00:00:44.370> coordinated<00:00:44.760> we

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
together to being very coordinated we

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.420 
together to being very coordinated we
wanted<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.899> take<00:00:46.110> some<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.440> those<00:00:46.500> same<00:00:47.100> things

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
wanted to take some of those same things

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.299 
wanted to take some of those same things
that<00:00:47.610> made<00:00:47.820> team<00:00:48.719> play<00:00:48.899> grade<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.980> make<00:00:50.160> them

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
that made team play grade and make them

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.170 
that made team play grade and make them
simpler<00:00:50.670> make<00:00:50.820> them<00:00:50.940> more<00:00:51.030> accessible

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
simpler make them more accessible

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.090 
simpler make them more accessible

gives you kind of a persistent layer to

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.570 
gives you kind of a persistent layer to
the<00:01:12.570> game<00:01:12.750> so<00:01:13.740> each<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.159> three<00:01:14.369> ghosts

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
the game so each of the three ghosts

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.160 
the game so each of the three ghosts
classes<00:01:15.000> you're<00:01:15.180> leveling<00:01:15.479> up<00:01:15.630> 41<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.049> 50

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
classes you're leveling up 41 to 50

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.020 
classes you're leveling up 41 to 50
you're<00:01:16.680> getting<00:01:17.040> different<00:01:17.280> items<00:01:17.700> and

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
you're getting different items and

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.600 
you're getting different items and
customizing<00:01:18.810> them<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.520> during<00:01:20.520> the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
customizing them and during the

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.740 
customizing them and during the
development<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.119> game<00:01:21.240> we<00:01:21.360> spoke<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.689> a

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
development of the game we spoke to a

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.359 
development of the game we spoke to a
lot<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.869> real<00:01:22.110> Special<00:01:22.500> Forces<00:01:22.740> operatives

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
lot of real Special Forces operatives

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.800 
lot of real Special Forces operatives
and<00:01:23.790> one<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.090> things<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.330> really<00:01:24.479> struck

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
and one of the things that really struck

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.050 
and one of the things that really struck
us<00:01:24.840> was<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.290> idea<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.590> they<00:01:26.159> go<00:01:26.310> into<00:01:26.460> to

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
us was the idea that they go into to

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.880 
us was the idea that they go into to
battle<00:01:27.299> not<00:01:27.390> with<00:01:27.450> their<00:01:27.659> standard<00:01:27.990> kit<00:01:28.200> with

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
battle not with their standard kit with

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.010 
battle not with their standard kit with
exactly<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.490> type<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.700> items<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.689> they<00:01:30.720> need

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
exactly the type of items that they need

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.109 
exactly the type of items that they need
they<00:01:31.290> think<00:01:31.500> they<00:01:31.590> need<00:01:31.740> for<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.009> mission<00:01:32.159> so

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
they think they need for that mission so

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.819 
they think they need for that mission so
really<00:01:33.270> tried<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.689> make<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:34.500> experience

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
really tried to make that experience
