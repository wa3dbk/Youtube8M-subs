00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:07.200
 hello I am alexander anne d'arman 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.389
 by profession I will teach you how to 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:19.400
 to make a mojito we need to 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:24.990
 lime of mint brown sugar of rome 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:30.060
 and diesel in hardware 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:35.010
 we need a pestle of a 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:38.670
 spoon a mixture of a measure and of 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:42.000
 our glass which is an unemployed person necessarily 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.190
 who says cocktail says ice cubes and we 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.989
 let's go for the mojito it's what 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.910
 also pay 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.739
 I give you my tip before cutting 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.210
 the lemon that flattens in the palm of 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:58.739
 my hand to get break the finma and 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:02.270
 get his juice more easily 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.270
 we will cut our lime 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:14.040
 my way of cutting lemon is that 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:17.030
 I first run the entames and then 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.110
 half jar cuts in four 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:24.290
 we will start by putting the 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.290
 mint leaves in our mojito 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.780
 according to m about fifteen sheets 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.390
 now we will be able to put 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:38.310
 our lime, that is eight 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:41.400
 pieces half a lime then 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.290
 we will put some brown sugar 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.430
 I use a mocha spoon so 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.040
 it is smaller than a spoon 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.780
 coffee in quantity to kill a coffee that's 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.770
 an enemy now we're going 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.110
 power pounded my trick to pound the 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.610
 mojito is that I turn my glass 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.939
 in a sense and I'm going to batteries and in 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:03.859
 the other 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:06.049
 the idea is to get the juice of lemon 

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:10.549
 crease the sleeve but not too much 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:14.900
 crushed now we will be able 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:16.340
 add a few ice cubes in a lot 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.319
 of establishments serves you the mojito 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.120
 with crushed ice 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.430
 I'm not necessarily for that stash 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.890
 crushed ice make very fast and 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.450
 will dilute our mojito the idea this is 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.340
 anyway to refresh the cocktail is 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.950
 not necessarily dilute it 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:35.110
 we will now put 4 cents 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.110
 liter of rum 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:42.730
 we will put 5 centilitres of water 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.730
 gas 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.070
 we go 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:11.239
 mix our mojito for me the 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.190
 cocktail is in the spirit of sharing I 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.420
 always put straw both straws 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.400
 two different sizes for a 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.079
 optical effect is prettier and here 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.079
 our moretto and ready to be tasted
