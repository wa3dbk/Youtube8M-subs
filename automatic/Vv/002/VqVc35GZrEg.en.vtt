00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.500
Ugh, it's called lolita, it has to be a fetish.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.060
Why are you dressed like a child?

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.800
Oh my god, are you trying to attracth paedophiles?

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.840
Hey little bo peep, can I be your sheep? 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.080
Woah woah woah woah woah. 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:14.640
Hold up!

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.240
Really?

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.600
If you're familiar with lolita fashion,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.780
you've probably heard the whole

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:29.960
'fetish thing' before.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.400
So why is lolita called lolita anyway?

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.940
Perhaps we aught to start on what lolita actually is,

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.840
first, rather than what it isn't.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.420
Surprisingly unrelated to the book of the same title,

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.720
lolita fashion today is characterised by a

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.040
clothing style which draws inspiration from the

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.680
Rococo, Romantic and Victorian periods.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.080
The cuts and styles are reminiscent of those worn by

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.080
young ladies.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.300
And the overall concept of the subculture is to

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.120
appear as kawaii, or as cute as possible.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.960
Now, for an overseas audience, 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.760
the first thing that comes to mind is,

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.560
"Oh my God, what about Nabakov's book?"

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.360
I mean, it makes perfect sense right?

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.660
I mean, there are childlike elements to the style

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.460
and everything's in a name.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.420
And what's more,

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.920
because women's bodies are constantly

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.180
objectified and sexualised in public spaces,

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.640
we usually read what she wears as a form of

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.800
sexual expression or regression.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.520
And then, there's that subgenre, lolicon.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.580
Well lolita fashion today is actually a form of

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.840
sexual expression.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.800
But it's one which asserts modesty and the right

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.100
to dress and appear as a woman chooses to,

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.160
without actually having to please a man.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.560
It's not about having sex at all. Period.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.400
Gagne identified that up until recently,

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.280
lolita girls actually used a different spelling

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.560
to seperate what they wear from lolicon.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.480
It's called lolita fashion now though.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.880
But you've probably heard all that before,

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.780
and that doesn't really explain the name hey?

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.740
So why is it called lolita?

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.160
You may have heard the argument that

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.060
lolita is a form of wasei-eigo,

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.740
which means a borrowed English word which

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.580
people in Japan might not actually fully comprehend.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.720
Some people say that lolita was chosen because it sounds cute.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.460
Now this is somewhat true.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.300
Lolitas I've spoken to have suggested that

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.920
perhaps the name reflected the youthful style in

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.140
sound only.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.840
Lo-li-ta.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.300
But actually, that's not completely correct either.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.960
The name seems to have emerged collectively over time,

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.820
as people began to develop the style together.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.080
It's quite true that participants today still aren't actually 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.760
quite sure where the name came from 100%.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.820
But from what I've gathered during interviews,

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.020
the answer seems to be twofold.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.960
First of all, the name lolita comes from Dolores,

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.700
which means the Virgin Mary of Sorrows in Spanish.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.440
What a lot of people don't realise is that

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.460
lolita fashion sprung from the goth scene in 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.980
Osaka and Tokyo, while girls in the 90's

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.880
were donning Neo-Victorian leather dresses,

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.000
whose style depicted waif-like,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.940
tragic, deformed and broken little doll-like figures.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.640
It wasn't actually all about Visual Kei cosplay.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.780
Lolita in this sense was chosen to reflect

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.440
this darkness, and antogonise and confront the public;

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.840
and it's working right?

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.660
Another idea suggested to me was that

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.000
when the pastel and vibrant colours entered

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.160
into the fashion scene there,

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.440
magazines like Zipper were doing spreads titled 'Lolita',

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.760
inspired by the 1997 film adaptation of the novel.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.820
This involved styles that didn't follow the strict Lolita

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.680
rules about modesty.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.540
Not comprehending the full implications of what was

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.280
being suggested by the name,

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.053
other than appearing just a little bit cute and playful,

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.900
this was taken on designers and participants.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.240
Lolitas eventually took on the colours, but not the style.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.854
We need to remember that actually,

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.201
not everything's in a name.

00:03:23.201 --> 00:03:24.240
Think about it. 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.960
The name football can be applied to two different sports.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.079
Are we really going to suggest the two sports are exactly the same?

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.901
A lot of lolitas in tokyo said they wished the name

00:03:32.901 --> 00:03:35.461
could be changed to 'Alice-kei' or something.

00:03:35.461 --> 00:03:36.641
And I think, why not?

00:03:36.641 --> 00:03:39.181
But we also need to remember the cultural gap between

00:03:39.181 --> 00:03:39.981
Japan and here.

00:03:39.981 --> 00:03:42.781
Not everyone in Tokyo has read Nabakov.

00:03:42.781 --> 00:03:44.840
We also need to think about what this says

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.300
in terms of how we read the female body

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.960
when we jump to these conclusions.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.260
A human body is more than a sexual object,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.280
after all.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.600
