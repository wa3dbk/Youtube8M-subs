00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:06.010
 hello and I'm back 

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:10.140
 I do not know if they remember but does some 

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:10.140
 I made a collection of bow ties 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:17.310
 and in that moment I discovered that not much 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.230
 people know how to make a bun and include 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.910
 that's why in today's video I 'm going to 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.260
 teach how to tie your knot 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.830
 bow tie 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:29.130
 because the clip are for children good 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.080
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.910
 button up the shirt there in my case 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.450
 pick up my hair because if they do not go 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.450
 to see nothing 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.120
 there it is in my little chicito hipster 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:53.930
 so we have to face 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.390
 a mirror I'm fine with the little thing 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:00.489
 of the camera since they have been fastened 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.489
 the button have to raise his neck 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:08.130
 and now they have to grab his tie 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.400
 The first thing they have to do is 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:16.280
 traverse it as from a smaller side 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:19.340
 and this point where it gets narrower 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.360
 they have to see that I give you right to the 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.360
 height of your button 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.719
 now they have to pass the other end 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:29.719
 over 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.920
 since they crossed it they have to pass this 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.920
 bottom end 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.960
 for more rare and they will stay like this 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.700
 right now we are not going to use this bit 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.409
 then they can throw it 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:58.350
 let's do this side if they realize 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:01.320
 Here you can see the shape of the bun 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.420
 you see the wings 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.680
 and the center 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:10.960
 Now what we're going to do is fold it 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:15.280
 like they make a fold 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:17.370
 they just have to line up the center 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.170
 there is 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:25.390
 ok now since they have this like this we are going to 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.060
 use this weight that we leave behind 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.569
 and we will move it forward on 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.730
 the bathroom 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.240
 I'm going to do this part very close to 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:38.560
 the camera so you can see it well 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:43.720
 here we have folded the part cortita 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:46.570
 and we passed over the longer end 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.990
 now they have to put these two together 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:54.710
 center 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:54.710
 to make a hole here 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.980
 to see there 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:07.959
 and you can see the hole there is a 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.150
 hole here does not have to be so 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:14.099
 big but I'm doing it big 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:18.130
 so they can see it since they have that they are going to 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:21.099
 push the long but without that 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:25.239
 pass everything grip what in the middle 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:27.840
 where is the curvita put your finger and 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:31.430
 with your finger push 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.430
 but without everything happening 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.750
 half has already passed this side 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:42.270
 then they have to pull it so that 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.270
 the other fin is made 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:50.010
 and it's practically done 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:54.500
 they just have to accommodate 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.500
 and pull why over there 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.700
 If you have a lot of cloth left on one side 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:05.180
 other then just pull up I think you see 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.180
 well, well 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.879
 since they have nothing lower ready 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.879
 in his neck 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.580
 and ready 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.530
 well I'll leave a link in the 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:21.130
 description so they see all the 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:24.010
 bow ties that I made and then since the 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:27.660
 see and like if you like 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.660

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.599
 and then if they want youtube to warn them 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:37.699
