00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 In this video I show you as you 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.720
 the philips gogear vibe mp3 player 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.550
 I can open the player 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.469
 open to a loose contact at the 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.420
 eliminate headphone jack 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.490
 the manual is of course also for the 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.500
 Battery replacement or other repairs 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.150
 helpful with a little umra 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:29.369
 screwdriver can be the keyboard 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:30.779
 carefully pry the cover first 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.759
 with a small cross slot 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.350
 screwdriver the screws down and 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.350
 remove on the left side 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.860
 After that you can see the cover for the 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.860
 Display off 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.610
 Now you have access to four more 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.610
 cross slot screws 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.450
 if these screws are removed 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.320
 the player electronics from the 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.320
 housing levers 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.280
 Now you can screw the three 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.900
 Remove the board 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.790
 Unfortunately, philips has one 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.410
 plug connection for the supply of 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.300
 Saved front keys 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:02:01.430
 this way you can not get the board 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:02:03.560
 completely fold around with the help of one 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.540
 toothpick I have the board something 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.940
 levered away from the housing and the 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.590
 Contacts of the jack after soldered 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.930
 the device has here again after 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.550
 I work perfectly 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.620
 Much success in disassembling and 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.420
 Assemble the mp3 player 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.890
 Thanks for watching and 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.890
 Maybe until next time
