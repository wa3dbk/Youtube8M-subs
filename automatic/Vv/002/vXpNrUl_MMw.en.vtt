redpower<00:00:15.220> tutorial<00:00:16.200> today<00:00:17.200> we're<00:00:17.470> going<00:00:17.560> to

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:17.619 
redpower tutorial today we're going to

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:19.170 
redpower tutorial today we're going to
look<00:00:17.770> at<00:00:17.890> the<00:00:18.039> intro<00:00:18.369> I've<00:00:18.520> been<00:00:18.670> using<00:00:18.850> for

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:19.180 
look at the intro I've been using for

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.750 
look at the intro I've been using for
most<00:00:19.330> of<00:00:19.420> my<00:00:19.480> videos<00:00:19.570> I<00:00:20.160> had<00:00:21.160> a<00:00:21.190> request<00:00:21.520> for

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:21.760 
most of my videos I had a request for

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.730 
most of my videos I had a request for
this<00:00:21.910> and<00:00:22.150> it's<00:00:22.210> relatively<00:00:22.660> simple<00:00:22.869> and<00:00:23.289> it

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740 
this and it's relatively simple and it

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.560 
this and it's relatively simple and it
shows<00:00:23.949> some<00:00:24.190> basic<00:00:24.640> circuit<00:00:25.000> designs<00:00:25.330> that

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:25.570 
shows some basic circuit designs that

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.710 
shows some basic circuit designs that
you<00:00:25.630> might<00:00:25.840> find<00:00:25.869> useful<00:00:26.110> in<00:00:26.560> other<00:00:26.680> builds

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
you might find useful in other builds

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.060 
you might find useful in other builds
here<00:00:28.720> you<00:00:28.869> can<00:00:28.990> see<00:00:29.170> all<00:00:29.199> of<00:00:29.440> the<00:00:29.650> circuitry

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
here you can see all of the circuitry

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.609 
here you can see all of the circuitry
behind<00:00:30.430> the<00:00:30.550> sign<00:00:30.789> but<00:00:31.720> first<00:00:31.960> we're<00:00:32.259> going<00:00:32.439> to

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
behind the sign but first we're going to

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.229 
behind the sign but first we're going to
go<00:00:32.739> through<00:00:32.769> it<00:00:33.100> piece<00:00:33.309> by<00:00:33.339> piece<00:00:33.519> and<00:00:33.969> then

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
go through it piece by piece and then

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.510 
go through it piece by piece and then
we'll<00:00:34.479> put<00:00:34.690> it<00:00:34.809> all<00:00:34.929> together

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.700 

let's<00:00:39.240> start<00:00:39.360> with<00:00:39.570> some<00:00:39.840> basics<00:00:40.290> about<00:00:40.380> red

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
let's start with some basics about red

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
power wiring as you can see here we have

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.080 
power wiring as you can see here we have
six<00:00:43.230> lamps<00:00:43.560> touching<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.280> single<00:00:44.700> red<00:00:44.910> wire

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
six lamps touching and a single red wire

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.630 
six lamps touching and a single red wire
pointing<00:00:45.600> at<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.870> side<00:00:46.080> of<00:00:46.110> one<00:00:46.260> lamp<00:00:46.640> when

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
pointing at the side of one lamp when

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.729 
pointing at the side of one lamp when
the<00:00:47.760> wire<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.150> powered<00:00:48.540> only<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.350> lamp<00:00:49.530> it's

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
the wire is powered only the lamp it's

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.130 
the wire is powered only the lamp it's
pointing<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.190> will<00:00:50.489> light<00:00:50.700> up<00:00:50.880> here<00:00:51.600> though<00:00:51.840> is

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140

attached to the side of the lamp this

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.310 
attached to the side of the lamp this
will<00:00:56.910> cause<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.270> lamp<00:00:57.450> itself<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.960> act<00:00:58.110> as<00:00:58.290> a

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
will cause the lamp itself to act as a

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.110 
will cause the lamp itself to act as a
power<00:00:58.559> source<00:00:58.860> and<00:00:59.160> light<00:00:59.520> up<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.820> lamps

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
you want to power the lamp in this

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.930 
you want to power the lamp in this
situation<00:01:20.260> you<00:01:21.100> have<00:01:21.220> to<00:01:21.370> detach<00:01:21.670> the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
situation you have to detach the

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.090 
situation you have to detach the
insulated<00:01:22.450> wire<00:01:22.630> and<00:01:22.900> add<00:01:23.230> a<00:01:23.260> piece<00:01:23.500> bare<00:01:23.860> red

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100

insulated wire and add a piece bare red
wire<00:01:24.750> just<00:01:25.750> as<00:01:25.930> before<00:01:26.320> the<00:01:26.770> red<00:01:26.950> wire<00:01:27.130> sends

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
wire just as before the red wire sends

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.610 
wire just as before the red wire sends
power<00:01:27.700> through<00:01:28.150> the<00:01:28.300> lamp<00:01:28.540> to<00:01:29.260> light<00:01:29.290> up<00:01:29.590> the

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
power through the lamp to light up the

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.110 
power through the lamp to light up the
lamps<00:01:30.010> next<00:01:30.310> to<00:01:30.400> it

lamps next to it

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.090 
lamps next to it
now<00:01:32.840> let's<00:01:33.080> take<00:01:33.290> a<00:01:33.350> look<00:01:33.440> at<00:01:33.710> how<00:01:33.800> to<00:01:33.860> make<00:01:34.070> a

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
now let's take a look at how to make a

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.860 
now let's take a look at how to make a
lamp<00:01:34.340> flicker<00:01:34.670> before<00:01:35.150> being<00:01:35.390> completely

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
lamp flicker before being completely

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.570 
lamp flicker before being completely
powered<00:01:36.260> on<00:01:36.410> the<00:01:36.770> way<00:01:36.890> a<00:01:36.920> fluorescent<00:01:37.460> light

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
powered on the way a fluorescent light

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.460 
powered on the way a fluorescent light
might<00:01:37.790> do<00:01:38.000> in<00:01:38.150> the<00:01:38.240> real<00:01:38.390> world

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
might do in the real world

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.320 
might do in the real world
here<00:01:41.470> we<00:01:41.590> have<00:01:41.740> just<00:01:41.950> a<00:01:42.070> timer<00:01:42.340> connected<00:01:43.180> to<00:01:43.300> a

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
here we have just a timer connected to a

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.990 
here we have just a timer connected to a
lamp<00:01:43.690> when<00:01:44.500> a<00:01:44.530> timer<00:01:44.860> receives<00:01:45.370> power<00:01:45.670> it

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
lamp when a timer receives power it

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.240 
lamp when a timer receives power it
turns<00:01:46.300> off<00:01:46.540> so<00:01:47.350> this<00:01:47.500> lever<00:01:47.680> is<00:01:47.860> currently

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
turns off so this lever is currently

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.510 
turns off so this lever is currently
powered<00:01:48.640> keeping<00:01:49.120> the<00:01:49.210> timer<00:01:49.420> from<00:01:49.630> spinning

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
powered keeping the timer from spinning

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.430 
powered keeping the timer from spinning
let's<00:01:51.520> turn<00:01:51.730> the<00:01:51.880> lever<00:01:52.030> off<00:01:52.300> which<00:01:53.230> will

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
let's turn the lever off which will

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.130 
let's turn the lever off which will
allow<00:01:53.590> the<00:01:53.710> timer<00:01:54.040> to<00:01:54.250> spin<00:01:54.490> the<00:01:55.480> timer<00:01:55.750> is<00:01:55.990> set

let's<00:02:04.000> play<00:02:04.090> world<00:02:04.420> I<00:02:04.720> have<00:02:04.990> a<00:02:05.020> timer<00:02:05.260> set<00:02:05.560> to

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
let's play world I have a timer set to

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.950 
let's play world I have a timer set to
pulse<00:02:05.890> every<00:02:06.250> 70<00:02:06.700> minutes<00:02:07.000> for<00:02:07.510> harvesting

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
pulse every 70 minutes for harvesting

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.930 
pulse every 70 minutes for harvesting
wheat<00:02:08.140> now<00:02:08.830> let's<00:02:09.070> see<00:02:09.220> what<00:02:09.369> happens<00:02:09.700> when<00:02:09.759> we

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
wheat now let's see what happens when we

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.390 
wheat now let's see what happens when we
hook<00:02:10.090> up<00:02:10.210> two<00:02:10.390> timers<00:02:10.780> to<00:02:10.960> the<00:02:11.050> same<00:02:11.260> lamp<00:02:11.500> the

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
hook up two timers to the same lamp the

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.980 
hook up two timers to the same lamp the
left<00:02:12.610> timer<00:02:12.850> here<00:02:13.090> is<00:02:13.240> set<00:02:13.450> to<00:02:13.540> pulse<00:02:13.720> every

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
left timer here is set to pulse every

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.380 
left timer here is set to pulse every
second<00:02:14.320> just<00:02:14.530> like<00:02:14.709> before<00:02:14.890> but<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:16.240> right

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
second just like before but the right

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.440 
second just like before but the right
timer<00:02:16.660> is<00:02:16.990> set<00:02:17.290> to<00:02:17.470> about<00:02:17.560> half<00:02:17.920> a<00:02:18.070> second<00:02:18.459> this

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
timer is set to about half a second this

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.510 
timer is set to about half a second this
exact<00:02:19.840> timing<00:02:20.410> isn't<00:02:20.620> important<00:02:21.250> for<00:02:21.430> the

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
exact timing isn't important for the

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.100 
exact timing isn't important for the
effect<00:02:21.760> we're<00:02:21.910> going<00:02:22.060> to<00:02:22.150> get<00:02:22.300> what's

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
effect we're going to get what's

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.840 
effect we're going to get what's
important<00:02:23.620> is<00:02:23.770> that<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:24.190> two<00:02:24.340> timers<00:02:24.670> are<00:02:24.820> set

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
important is that the two timers are set

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.080 
important is that the two timers are set
to<00:02:25.150> different<00:02:25.570> times<00:02:25.840> fairly<00:02:26.680> close<00:02:26.860> together

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
to different times fairly close together

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.160 
to different times fairly close together
you<00:02:28.090> can<00:02:28.209> play<00:02:28.360> around<00:02:28.450> with<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:28.750> timing<00:02:29.080> to

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
you can play around with the timing to

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.740 
you can play around with the timing to
get<00:02:29.290> slightly<00:02:29.650> different<00:02:30.100> results<00:02:30.720> when<00:02:31.720> you

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
get slightly different results when you

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.600 
get slightly different results when you
have<00:02:31.959> two<00:02:32.200> timers<00:02:32.650> with<00:02:32.950> different<00:02:33.340> spin

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
have two timers with different spin

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.540 
have two timers with different spin
times<00:02:33.940> hooked<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:34.870> same<00:02:35.140> output<00:02:35.680> wire<00:02:35.860> the

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
times hooked to the same output wire the

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:37.979 
times hooked to the same output wire the
effect<00:02:36.880> is<00:02:37.030> something<00:02:37.390> that<00:02:37.480> looks<00:02:37.660> kind<00:02:37.930> of

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
effect is something that looks kind of

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:43.850 
effect is something that looks kind of
like<00:02:38.050> random<00:02:38.560> blinking<00:02:39.010> like<00:02:39.640> this

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.199 

so<00:02:44.860> now<00:02:45.069> we<00:02:45.129> know<00:02:45.370> how<00:02:45.670> to<00:02:45.730> make<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.060> light

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
so now we know how to make the light

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.360 
so now we know how to make the light
flicker<00:02:46.510> but<00:02:47.470> how<00:02:47.560> do<00:02:47.620> we<00:02:47.769> get<00:02:47.890> it<00:02:48.010> to<00:02:48.040> flicker

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
flicker but how do we get it to flicker

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.330 
flicker but how do we get it to flicker
for<00:02:48.640> a<00:02:48.670> while<00:02:48.849> and<00:02:49.120> then<00:02:49.239> stay<00:02:49.480> solid<00:02:50.160> here<00:02:51.160> we

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
for a while and then stay solid here we

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.009 
for a while and then stay solid here we
have<00:02:51.459> the<00:02:51.640> same<00:02:51.849> two<00:02:52.060> timers<00:02:52.480> set<00:02:52.870> two

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
have the same two timers set two

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.920 
have the same two timers set two
different<00:02:53.290> times<00:02:53.760> this<00:02:54.760> one<00:02:54.970> is<00:02:55.060> set<00:02:55.209> to<00:02:55.360> 0.6

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
different times this one is set to 0.6

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.860 
different times this one is set to 0.6
seconds<00:02:56.349> but<00:02:56.560> I'll<00:02:56.769> go<00:02:56.920> ahead<00:02:57.010> and<00:02:57.099> set<00:02:57.519> it<00:02:57.640> to

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
seconds but I'll go ahead and set it to

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.750 
seconds but I'll go ahead and set it to
0.55<00:02:58.870> to<00:02:59.709> make<00:02:59.860> it<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.099> same<00:03:00.310> as<00:03:00.489> the<00:03:00.610> previous

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
0.55 to make it the same as the previous

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.580 
0.55 to make it the same as the previous
example<00:03:01.090> and<00:03:01.540> this<00:03:01.870> one<00:03:02.049> is<00:03:02.170> set<00:03:02.319> to<00:03:02.440> one

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
example and this one is set to one

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.039 
example and this one is set to one
second<00:03:02.980> just<00:03:03.099> as<00:03:03.310> before<00:03:03.670> again<00:03:04.660> it<00:03:04.870> doesn't

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
second just as before again it doesn't

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.949 
second just as before again it doesn't
really<00:03:05.319> matter<00:03:05.700> this<00:03:06.700> time<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.360> input<00:03:07.750> to<00:03:07.870> the

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
really matter this time the input to the

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.339 
really matter this time the input to the
timers<00:03:08.379> is<00:03:08.590> a<00:03:08.650> not<00:03:09.160> gate<00:03:09.640> this<00:03:10.540> is<00:03:10.690> because<00:03:11.019> in

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
timers is a not gate this is because in

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:12.930 
timers is a not gate this is because in
the<00:03:11.590> right<00:03:11.769> side<00:03:11.980> of<00:03:12.099> the<00:03:12.190> circuit<00:03:12.519> we<00:03:12.640> want<00:03:12.849> to

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
the right side of the circuit we want to

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.150 
the right side of the circuit we want to
know<00:03:13.030> when<00:03:13.239> the<00:03:13.330> lever<00:03:13.510> turns<00:03:13.780> on<00:03:14.040> but<00:03:15.040> the

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
know when the lever turns on but the

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.800 
know when the lever turns on but the
timer's<00:03:15.549> still<00:03:15.819> need<00:03:16.000> to<00:03:16.090> be<00:03:16.209> powered<00:03:16.569> in

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
timer's still need to be powered in

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.809 
timer's still need to be powered in
order<00:03:17.019> to<00:03:17.110> stay<00:03:17.319> off<00:03:17.560> until<00:03:18.280> we're<00:03:18.400> ready<00:03:18.430> for

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
order to stay off until we're ready for

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.449 
order to stay off until we're ready for
them<00:03:19.349> the<00:03:20.349> right<00:03:20.530> side<00:03:20.799> of<00:03:20.920> the<00:03:21.010> circuit<00:03:21.370> is

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
them the right side of the circuit is

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.460 
them the right side of the circuit is
simply<00:03:21.880> repeater<00:03:22.299> set<00:03:22.900> to<00:03:23.049> a<00:03:23.079> pretty<00:03:23.319> long

simply repeater set to a pretty long
delay<00:03:24.150> this<00:03:25.150> allows<00:03:25.450> the<00:03:25.660> flickering<00:03:25.989> timers

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
delay this allows the flickering timers

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.500 
delay this allows the flickering timers
to<00:03:26.500> operate<00:03:26.829> for<00:03:27.010> a<00:03:27.040> short<00:03:27.310> while<00:03:27.489> and<00:03:27.849> then

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
flicker and then turn on but how do we

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.790 
flicker and then turn on but how do we
get<00:04:26.450> the<00:04:26.570> border<00:04:26.870> lights<00:04:27.080> to<00:04:27.320> blink<00:04:27.560> in

you

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:01.769 
you
we<00:07:00.580> can<00:07:00.759> also<00:07:00.879> just<00:07:01.150> click<00:07:01.389> on<00:07:01.509> the<00:07:01.629> latch

so all we need to do is hook a bunch of

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:09.000 
so all we need to do is hook a bunch of
these<00:07:07.690> together<00:07:07.900> and<00:07:08.380> we<00:07:08.650> get<00:07:08.800> a<00:07:08.830> nice

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:09.010 
these together and we get a nice

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:11.890 
sequence using this circuit we can use

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:13.710

as<00:07:12.040> many<00:07:12.190> lamps<00:07:12.490> in<00:07:12.760> the<00:07:12.790> sequence<00:07:13.180> as<00:07:13.330> we<00:07:13.480> want

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:13.720 
as many lamps in the sequence as we want

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.930 
as many lamps in the sequence as we want
and<00:07:13.900> we<00:07:14.620> can<00:07:14.740> easily<00:07:14.950> turn<00:07:15.280> the<00:07:15.460> sequence<00:07:15.760> on

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:15.940 
and we can easily turn the sequence on

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:18.030 
and we can easily turn the sequence on
and<00:07:16.150> off<00:07:16.240> with<00:07:16.540> a<00:07:16.600> single<00:07:17.020> and<00:07:17.230> gate<00:07:17.530> at<00:07:17.710> the

lamps and when the sequence gets to the

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.340 
lamps and when the sequence gets to the
end<00:07:26.230> it<00:07:26.700> simply<00:07:27.700> sends<00:07:28.360> its<00:07:28.540> signal<00:07:28.960> back<00:07:29.110> to

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:29.350 
end it simply sends its signal back to

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:30.750 
end it simply sends its signal back to
the<00:07:29.470> first<00:07:29.650> lamp<00:07:29.920> through<00:07:30.190> this<00:07:30.370> gray<00:07:30.730> wire

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:30.760 
the first lamp through this gray wire

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.960 
the first lamp through this gray wire
and<00:07:31.240> so<00:07:32.200> it<00:07:32.320> keeps<00:07:32.470> repeating<00:07:32.800> the<00:07:33.550> green<00:07:33.790> wire

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:33.970 
and so it keeps repeating the green wire

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:36.900 
and so it keeps repeating the green wire
above<00:07:34.390> comes<00:07:34.810> from<00:07:35.140> the<00:07:35.380> on/off<00:07:35.710> switch<00:07:36.040> and<00:07:36.340> a

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:36.910 
above comes from the on/off switch and a

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:38.670 
above comes from the on/off switch and a
single<00:07:37.090> and<00:07:37.360> gate<00:07:37.660> is<00:07:37.840> used<00:07:38.140> to<00:07:38.350> turn<00:07:38.530> the

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:38.680 
single and gate is used to turn the

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:46.580 
single and gate is used to turn the
sequence<00:07:39.010> on<00:07:39.220> and<00:07:39.490> off

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:46.590 

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:48.800 

you<00:07:47.280> can<00:07:47.430> see<00:07:47.610> that<00:07:47.640> each<00:07:47.880> lamp<00:07:48.150> has<00:07:48.390> one<00:07:48.720> of

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:48.810 
you can see that each lamp has one of

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:50.300 
you can see that each lamp has one of
the<00:07:48.900> nine<00:07:49.080> colored<00:07:49.410> wires<00:07:49.590> attached<00:07:49.980> to<00:07:50.190> it

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:50.310 
the nine colored wires attached to it

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:52.370 
the nine colored wires attached to it
and<00:07:50.460> the<00:07:51.180> colors<00:07:51.450> are<00:07:51.630> lined<00:07:51.810> up<00:07:51.930> in<00:07:52.110> the<00:07:52.140> same

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:52.380 
and the colors are lined up in the same

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:58.930 
and the colors are lined up in the same
order<00:07:52.680> that<00:07:52.890> the<00:07:53.280> monostable<00:07:53.580> sequence<00:07:54.210> fires

00:07:58.930 --> 00:07:58.940 

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.330 

so<00:07:59.720> that's<00:07:59.990> it<00:08:00.170> for<00:08:00.200> this<00:08:00.410> tutorial<00:08:00.590> I<00:08:01.070> hope
