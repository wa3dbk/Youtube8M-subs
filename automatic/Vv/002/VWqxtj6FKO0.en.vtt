00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.100
 were discovered new objects of the time 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:10.130
 Roman 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.130
 now in a grotto of alvaiÃ¡zere leiria 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:19.670
 the air force is developing airplanes 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.100
 unmanned aircraft are only ready 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.950
 environmental and surveillance 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:28.300
 admits that they will soon be able to 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:31.940
 be able to carry armaments 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.400
 is called alpha extended three meters and 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.070
 mail span and can reach 100 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.280
 kilometers and to compel 26 kilos of 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.280
 Weight 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.530
 one year of development at the 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.140
 air force now on the alvor 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.739
 ocean path without any club 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.739
 borges 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:59.260
 today the control of the aircraft is made in the 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.479
 station on land or in the case and more than 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.940
 a special one on the way to one and the unit 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:05.619
 Mobile installed at the bar is that it 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.680
 I'm eating what the honorable Member is 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:11.590
 that there is a vessel that is 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.090
 which should be monitored to see is the tou 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.899
 people on board tried this 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.670
 vessel 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:16.960
 then we give positive information that 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.509
 she's really there and we in this 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.509
 moment we are observing this zone 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:24.539
 to identify is vessel and watched 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:27.640
 from above in this exercise scenario 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:29.710
 odone is practically invisible and 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.520
 altitude at which to meet her 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.929
 spying on the target without even being heard 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.539
 information and transmitted in real time 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:39.520
 allowing the navy to finally 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:41.289
 approach this moment we think that 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.210
 we can not only do 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:44.110
 transfer of technology by force 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.700
 aerial 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.680
 we returned to the military forces of 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.780
 security and other entities 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:54.369
 governmental and non-governmental organizations 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:57.969
 we reach a level of operation that 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:00.850
 allows you to start thinking about the context of 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:04.450
 probably the creation of the 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.789
 to have passed the professional in the 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.860
 of the 80 jumping from 13 votes 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.840
 video cameras of different types of 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.060
 sensors of a programmed processor 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.340
 to manage the lengths prepare the 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.829
 alpha for surveillance and coast missions 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.410
 and monitoring scenarios. 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:22.780
 environmental catastrophe is not among the 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.519
 which turn it into a bomber as 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.620
 The United States has done but it is possible 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:29.459
 everything is possible as it is as it is 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.579
 logical is that we are focusing on the 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:35.680
 develop platforms attest 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:38.079
 loudes to be in the concepts of oppression 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.090
 and then for sure this one 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:42.280
 look at the highest level ee so that 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.049
 take such decisions does not seem to have 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.730
 really the air force needs this 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.549
 kind of walls we have the knowledge 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.079
 and we also have three times we have 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.510
 that we have developed here 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:53.830
 shirt personnel can not replace the 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.470
 manned aircraft 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.720
 can and complement them and do as 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.550
 costs drastically lower than that 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.980
 flight time or be like everyone else 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.350
 fuel is with electric can 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.930
 stay in the 50 cent says 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.450
 hence already in November issued a new 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.450
 with autonomy for 15 hours of 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:19.360
 flight will turn the brakes on and on 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:22.350
 case it will be controlled by satellite a 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:26.070
 cheaper and safer future for man 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.070
 were discovered
