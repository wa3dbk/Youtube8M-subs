pin 427 crank newly developed by you sir
tell<00:01:50.830> me<00:01:50.920> about<00:01:51.010> this<00:01:51.690> guys<00:01:52.690> that<00:01:53.110> are<00:01:53.230> racing

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
tell me about this guys that are racing

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.150 
tell me about this guys that are racing
Duramax<00:01:54.340> v8<00:01:54.790> diesels<00:01:55.300> are<00:01:55.920> braking<00:01:56.920> crank

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
Duramax v8 diesels are braking crank

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.090 
Duramax v8 diesels are braking crank
shafts<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:58.479> we<00:01:58.600> did<00:01:58.780> something<00:01:59.140> unique<00:01:59.800> in<00:02:00.010> the

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
shafts so we did something unique in the

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.130 
shafts so we did something unique in the
automotive<00:02:00.580> aftermarket<00:02:00.729> I<00:02:01.540> don't<00:02:01.990> think

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
automotive aftermarket I don't think

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.870 
automotive aftermarket I don't think
it's<00:02:02.229> ever<00:02:02.350> been<00:02:02.470> done<00:02:02.650> we<00:02:03.100> created<00:02:03.700> our<00:02:03.850> own

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
it's ever been done we created our own

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.100 
it's ever been done we created our own
bearing<00:02:04.479> size<00:02:05.369> diameter<00:02:06.570> so<00:02:07.570> we<00:02:07.750> made<00:02:07.960> the

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
bearing size diameter so we made the

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.210 
bearing size diameter so we made the
pins<00:02:08.820> three<00:02:09.820> millimeters<00:02:10.330> bigger<00:02:10.539> than<00:02:10.810> stock

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
pins three millimeters bigger than stock

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.229 
pins three millimeters bigger than stock
so<00:02:12.220> we're<00:02:12.370> able<00:02:12.490> to<00:02:12.640> do<00:02:12.880> a<00:02:13.470> billet<00:02:14.470> forged

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
so we're able to do a billet forged

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.560 
so we're able to do a billet forged
connecting<00:02:16.239> rod<00:02:16.480> and<00:02:17.970> we're<00:02:18.970> developing<00:02:19.180> a

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
connecting rod and we're developing a

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.350 
connecting rod and we're developing a
steel<00:02:19.810> piston<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:21.430> steel<00:02:21.670> piston<00:02:21.940> is

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
steel piston the steel piston is

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.830 
steel piston the steel piston is
slightly<00:02:23.350> heavier<00:02:24.030> with<00:02:25.030> its<00:02:25.209> wrists<00:02:25.510> penned

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
slightly heavier with its wrists penned

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.280 
slightly heavier with its wrists penned
in<00:02:26.080> the<00:02:26.350> aluminum<00:02:26.770> piston<00:02:27.300> but<00:02:28.300> incredibly

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
in the aluminum piston but incredibly

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.690 
in the aluminum piston but incredibly
durable<00:02:29.500> in<00:02:29.830> high<00:02:29.950> temperatures<00:02:30.459> and<00:02:30.610> high

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
durable in high temperatures and high

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.840 
durable in high temperatures and high
pressures<00:02:30.840> so<00:02:31.840> what<00:02:32.050> we've<00:02:32.200> created<00:02:32.580> if<00:02:33.580> your

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
pressures so what we've created if your

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.900

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
really badass street rod so the message

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.800 
really badass street rod so the message
here<00:02:43.330> is<00:02:43.360> at<00:02:43.930> banks<00:02:44.980> we're<00:02:45.940> engine<00:02:46.390> people

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
here is at banks we're engine people

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.470 
here is at banks we're engine people
yeah<00:02:47.440> we<00:02:47.739> make<00:02:47.980> a<00:02:48.010> lot<00:02:48.280> of<00:02:48.340> components<00:02:49.299> that<00:02:49.360> go

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
yeah we make a lot of components that go

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.990 
yeah we make a lot of components that go
on<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:49.810> outside<00:02:50.200> or<00:02:50.920> the<00:02:50.980> electrical<00:02:51.820> or

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
on the outside or the electrical or

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.880 
on the outside or the electrical or
electronic<00:02:52.330> components<00:02:53.080> to<00:02:53.230> run<00:02:53.470> all<00:02:53.620> of<00:02:53.650> this

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
electronic components to run all of this

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.090 
electronic components to run all of this
and<00:02:54.160> we<00:02:54.670> do<00:02:54.880> it<00:02:55.060> because<00:02:55.810> because<00:02:56.100> we're

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
and we do it because because we're

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.160 
and we do it because because we're

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
pushing the state-of-the-art I'm a

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.000 
pushing the state-of-the-art I'm a
futurist<00:02:59.830> I'm<00:03:00.280> all<00:03:00.610> about<00:03:00.880> what's<00:03:01.299> next<00:03:01.959> and<00:03:02.410> I

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
futurist I'm all about what's next and I

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.270 
futurist I'm all about what's next and I
can't<00:03:03.340> get<00:03:03.670> what's<00:03:03.970> next<00:03:04.690> down<00:03:05.530> at<00:03:05.739> the<00:03:05.920> the

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
can't get what's next down at the the

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.550 
can't get what's next down at the the
auto<00:03:06.459> parts<00:03:06.790> store<00:03:06.959> so<00:03:07.959> you've<00:03:08.140> got<00:03:08.320> to<00:03:08.440> build

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
auto parts store so you've got to build

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.440 
auto parts store so you've got to build
it<00:03:08.739> yourself<00:03:08.860> and<00:03:09.370> we<00:03:09.519> are<00:03:09.670> glad<00:03:09.880> to<00:03:10.150> be<00:03:10.269> here

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
with you he may be a futurist but he's

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.860 
with you he may be a futurist but he's
also<00:03:12.489> a<00:03:12.610> legend<00:03:13.060> in<00:03:13.150> the<00:03:13.239> industry
