00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.480
...flying nice...                                                                  though the light weight there's no problem with the wind

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.060
...the Dragonfly is flying smoothly...

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.420
...time for some tricks...

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.800
...upside down...

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.980
...the turn...

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.960
...trying to land...                                                            not so easy because of the leight weight and the wind 

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:05.160
...little bit to high...                                                        new attempt                                                                 

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:35.680
...much too high and also too fast - once again...

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:48.360
...that's the way it goes :)

00:07:57.125 --> 00:08:00.925
Result: The Dragonfly is perfect to fly in the ridge lift with about 3 or 4 bft.                                                   

00:08:01.046 --> 00:08:04.906
The Dragonfly is very stable and because of it's light weight also perfect in thermal conditions.                   

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:08.480
There are lot's of discussions about the motor - but who really needs one         =:-]
