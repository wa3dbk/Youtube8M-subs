see what a ram disk performance offers
in<00:01:36.299> comparison<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.840> normal<00:01:37.079> SSD<00:01:37.500> let's<00:01:38.009> do

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
in comparison to a normal SSD let's do

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.609 
in comparison to a normal SSD let's do
it<00:01:38.310> okay<00:01:38.759> so<00:01:39.110> while<00:01:40.110> we<00:01:40.200> go<00:01:40.290> ahead<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.560> go

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
it okay so while we go ahead and go

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.870 
it okay so while we go ahead and go
through<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.860> creation<00:01:41.100> process<00:01:41.220> we're<00:01:41.850> going

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
through the creation process we're going

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.520 
through the creation process we're going
to<00:01:42.000> go<00:01:42.150> ahead<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.659> start<00:01:43.170> with<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.350> quick

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
to go ahead and start with a quick

rates of an SSD write correct but as we

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.630 
rates of an SSD write correct but as we

megabytes<00:02:05.100> or<00:02:05.280> as<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:05.729> noted<00:02:06.060> in<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.270> raid

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
megabytes or as you noted in the raid

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.670 
megabytes or as you noted in the raid
which<00:02:06.719> would<00:02:06.840> be<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:06.930> little<00:02:07.049> bit<00:02:07.229> over<00:02:07.500> one

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
which would be a little bit over one

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.559 
which would be a little bit over one
gigabyte<00:02:08.009> but<00:02:08.280> this<00:02:08.429> even<00:02:08.700> exceeds<00:02:09.330> that

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
gigabyte but this even exceeds that

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.080 
gigabyte but this even exceeds that
correct<00:02:10.170> so<00:02:10.649> let's<00:02:10.800> go<00:02:10.890> ahead<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.099> loosely

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
correct so let's go ahead and loosely

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.400 
correct so let's go ahead and loosely
it's<00:02:12.510> definitely<00:02:12.690> gonna<00:02:12.959> be<00:02:13.050> quite<00:02:13.200> a<00:02:13.260> bit

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
it's definitely gonna be quite a bit

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.559 
it's definitely gonna be quite a bit
faster<00:02:13.590> so<00:02:14.370> from<00:02:14.760> here<00:02:14.850> we're<00:02:15.150> just<00:02:15.180> gonna<00:02:15.360> go

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
faster so from here we're just gonna go

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.360 
faster so from here we're just gonna go
ahead<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:15.810> open<00:02:16.020> up<00:02:16.080> Ram<00:02:16.260> dis<00:02:16.440> plus<00:02:16.680> all

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
ahead and open up Ram dis plus all

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.559 
ahead and open up Ram dis plus all
righty<00:02:17.580> this<00:02:18.090> is<00:02:18.209> where<00:02:18.300> we're<00:02:18.420> going<00:02:18.510> to

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
righty this is where we're going to

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.480 
righty this is where we're going to
actually<00:02:18.870> create<00:02:19.080> our<00:02:19.470> RAM<00:02:19.830> disk<00:02:20.010> array<00:02:20.310> right

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
actually create our RAM disk array right

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.160 
actually create our RAM disk array right
that's<00:02:20.880> correct<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:21.450> we're<00:02:21.840> just<00:02:21.930> going<00:02:22.080> to

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
that's correct and we're just going to

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.590 
that's correct and we're just going to
go<00:02:22.260> ahead<00:02:22.319> and<00:02:22.500> go<00:02:22.680> add<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.069> volume<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.760> we're

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
go ahead and go add a volume and we're

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.210 
go ahead and go add a volume and we're
going<00:02:24.720> to<00:02:24.780> create<00:02:24.959> the<00:02:25.110> size<00:02:25.290> so<00:02:25.800> I<00:02:25.830> usually

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
going to create the size so I usually

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.620 
going to create the size so I usually
like<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.490> create<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.790> number<00:02:27.060> based<00:02:27.360> off<00:02:27.600> of

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
like to create the number based off of

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.870 
like to create the number based off of
an<00:02:27.930> approximate<00:02:28.470> amount<00:02:28.620> of<00:02:28.950> memory<00:02:29.310> so<00:02:29.790> an

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
an approximate amount of memory so an

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.400 
an approximate amount of memory so an
example<00:02:29.970> would<00:02:30.300> be<00:02:30.390> you<00:02:30.810> know<00:02:30.930> if<00:02:30.989> you<00:02:31.080> open<00:02:31.200> up

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
example would be you know if you open up

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.580 
example would be you know if you open up
let's<00:02:31.620> say<00:02:31.739> you<00:02:31.800> know<00:02:32.100> your<00:02:32.640> calculator<00:02:33.090> right

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
let's say you know your calculator right

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.770 
let's say you know your calculator right
so<00:02:34.590> we'll<00:02:34.709> just<00:02:34.830> go<00:02:34.980> calc<00:02:35.250> here<00:02:35.540> open<00:02:36.540> this<00:02:36.630> up

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
so we'll just go calc here open this up

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.479 
so we'll just go calc here open this up
and<00:02:37.020> you<00:02:37.560> want<00:02:37.709> to<00:02:37.770> multiply<00:02:37.890> you<00:02:38.190> know<00:02:38.340> like

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
and you want to multiply you know like

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.240 
and you want to multiply you know like
1024<00:02:39.209> by<00:02:39.480> 4<00:02:39.959> right<00:02:40.230> whatever<00:02:40.500> might<00:02:40.800> be<00:02:40.950> right

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
1024 by 4 right whatever might be right

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.949 
1024 by 4 right whatever might be right
just<00:02:41.280> try<00:02:41.970> to<00:02:42.030> create<00:02:42.300> an<00:02:42.420> overall<00:02:42.660> I<00:02:42.780> think

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
just try to create an overall I think

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.120 
just try to create an overall I think
approximate<00:02:43.530> number<00:02:43.709> to<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:43.890> amount<00:02:44.100> of

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
approximate number to the amount of

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.470 
approximate number to the amount of
memory<00:02:44.280> you<00:02:44.370> have<00:02:44.580> so<00:02:44.880> we'll<00:02:45.030> just<00:02:45.180> do<00:02:45.330> that

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
memory you have so we'll just do that

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.449 
memory you have so we'll just do that
it's<00:02:45.720> an<00:02:45.870> approximate<00:02:46.320> number<00:02:46.560> right<00:02:47.160> now<00:02:47.280> so

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
it's an approximate number right now so

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.550 
it's an approximate number right now so
this<00:02:47.550> is<00:02:47.610> about<00:02:47.790> 4<00:02:48.060> gigabyte<00:02:48.480> ram<00:02:49.019> disk<00:02:49.200> volume

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
this is about 4 gigabyte ram disk volume

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.800 
this is about 4 gigabyte ram disk volume
all<00:02:49.769> right<00:02:49.950> ok<00:02:50.700> now<00:02:51.030> it<00:02:51.120> gives<00:02:51.209> you<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.480> option

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
all right ok now it gives you the option

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.180 
all right ok now it gives you the option
do<00:02:51.870> you<00:02:51.930> want<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.200> zero<00:02:52.440> this<00:02:52.590> out<00:02:52.800> when<00:02:53.070> the

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
do you want to zero this out when the

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.710 
do you want to zero this out when the
memory<00:02:53.489> is<00:02:53.519> remove<00:02:53.880> it<00:02:53.910> or<00:02:54.060> restore<00:02:54.390> it<00:02:54.480> okay

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
memory is remove it or restore it okay

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.660 
memory is remove it or restore it okay
for<00:02:55.320> right<00:02:55.470> now<00:02:55.530> we<00:02:55.739> just<00:02:56.070> want<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.370> keep<00:02:56.489> a

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
for right now we just want to keep a

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:57.979 
for right now we just want to keep a
persistent<00:02:57.180> storage<00:02:57.390> so<00:02:57.600> we<00:02:57.690> don't<00:02:57.840> want<00:02:57.959> to

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
persistent storage so we don't want to

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.210 
persistent storage so we don't want to
zero<00:02:58.200> out<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.410> memory<00:02:58.650> right<00:02:58.830> so<00:02:58.980> basically

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
zero out the memory right so basically

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.040 
zero out the memory right so basically
just<00:02:59.459> explain<00:02:59.910> to<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.090> users<00:03:00.390> if<00:03:00.660> you<00:03:00.750> hit<00:03:00.900> the

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
just explain to the users if you hit the

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.630 
just explain to the users if you hit the
zero<00:03:01.319> button<00:03:01.560> that<00:03:01.860> means<00:03:02.040> it<00:03:02.160> basically<00:03:02.400> only

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
zero button that means it basically only

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.090 
zero button that means it basically only
keeps<00:03:02.940> it<00:03:03.060> in<00:03:03.180> a<00:03:03.300> temporary<00:03:03.750> state<00:03:04.350> correct<00:03:04.769> we

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
keeps it in a temporary state correct we

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.920 
keeps it in a temporary state correct we
don't<00:03:05.250> check<00:03:05.550> this<00:03:05.790> that<00:03:06.239> means<00:03:06.480> whatever<00:03:06.720> we

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
don't check this that means whatever we

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.449 
don't check this that means whatever we
store<00:03:07.170> them<00:03:07.290> restart<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:07.890> system<00:03:08.190> it<00:03:08.340> will

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
store them restart the system it will

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.130 
store them restart the system it will
maintain<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:09.000> integrity<00:03:09.269> that<00:03:09.480> information

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
maintain the integrity that information

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.720 
maintain the integrity that information
correct<00:03:10.500> correct<00:03:10.800> so<00:03:11.130> we<00:03:11.250> essentially<00:03:11.550> have

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
correct correct so we essentially have

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.210 
correct correct so we essentially have
that<00:03:11.880> persistent<00:03:12.239> RAM<00:03:12.600> disk<00:03:12.780> ok<00:03:13.709> it's<00:03:14.130> gonna

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
that persistent RAM disk ok it's gonna

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.100 
that persistent RAM disk ok it's gonna
ask<00:03:14.489> us<00:03:14.670> for<00:03:14.790> a<00:03:14.850> drive<00:03:15.030> letter<00:03:15.209> we're<00:03:15.540> fine<00:03:15.840> uh

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
ask us for a drive letter we're fine uh

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.020 
ask us for a drive letter we're fine uh
you<00:03:16.620> know<00:03:16.739> what<00:03:16.950> you<00:03:17.489> can<00:03:17.610> pick<00:03:17.730> whatever<00:03:17.880> you

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
you know what you can pick whatever you

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.050 
you know what you can pick whatever you
want<00:03:18.090> I<00:03:18.329> want<00:03:18.540> go<00:03:18.780> ahead<00:03:18.810> Z<00:03:19.880> we're<00:03:20.880> going<00:03:21.000> to

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
want I want go ahead Z we're going to

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.060 
want I want go ahead Z we're going to
keep<00:03:21.209> it<00:03:21.390> with<00:03:21.420> an<00:03:21.570> NT<00:03:21.810> s<00:03:21.900> format<00:03:22.350> okay<00:03:22.829> and

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
keep it with an NT s format okay and

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.069 
keep it with an NT s format okay and
then<00:03:24.000> right<00:03:24.180> there<00:03:24.209> it<00:03:24.450> asks<00:03:24.690> you<00:03:24.780> you<00:03:24.900> want<00:03:25.049> to

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
then right there it asks you you want to

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.660 
then right there it asks you you want to
save<00:03:25.290> it<00:03:25.320> shut<00:03:25.620> down<00:03:25.650> which<00:03:26.070> is<00:03:26.220> a<00:03:26.250> lich<00:03:26.640> is

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
save it shut down which is a lich is

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.060 
save it shut down which is a lich is
similar<00:03:27.090> to<00:03:27.299> the<00:03:27.420> remove<00:03:28.110> option<00:03:28.350> because<00:03:28.950> we

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
similar to the remove option because we

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.880 
similar to the remove option because we
could<00:03:29.190> unload<00:03:29.610> the<00:03:29.820> disk<00:03:30.200> dynamically<00:03:31.200> ok<00:03:31.680> and

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
could unload the disk dynamically ok and

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:32.930 
could unload the disk dynamically ok and
it<00:03:32.010> actually<00:03:32.130> says<00:03:32.400> it<00:03:32.549> says<00:03:32.700> this<00:03:32.790> is

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
it actually says it says this is

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.819 
it actually says it says this is
checking<00:03:33.390> this<00:03:33.510> box<00:03:33.570> will<00:03:34.019> preserve<00:03:34.440> the

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
checking this box will preserve the

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.530 
checking this box will preserve the
contents<00:03:35.250> of<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.549> RAM<00:03:35.700> disk<00:03:35.910> drive<00:03:36.209> for<00:03:36.480> the

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
contents of the RAM disk drive for the

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.750 
contents of the RAM disk drive for the
next<00:03:36.810> system<00:03:36.959> startup<00:03:37.590> court<00:03:38.160> so<00:03:38.549> we're<00:03:38.730> just

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
next system startup court so we're just

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.729 
next system startup court so we're just
gonna<00:03:38.970> go<00:03:39.120> and<00:03:39.209> select<00:03:39.480> that<00:03:39.600> click<00:03:40.410> finish

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
gonna go and select that click finish

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.920 
gonna go and select that click finish
and<00:03:40.950> it's<00:03:41.160> gonna<00:03:41.280> create<00:03:41.459> this<00:03:41.640> real<00:03:41.820> time<00:03:42.060> so

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
and it's gonna create this real time so

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.599 
and it's gonna create this real time so
you<00:03:43.260> can<00:03:43.530> see<00:03:43.680> right<00:03:43.799> here<00:03:43.859> it<00:03:44.100> says<00:03:44.220> adding

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
you can see right here it says adding

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:47.090 
you can see right here it says adding
new<00:03:44.730> RAM<00:03:44.940> disk<00:03:45.120> and<00:03:45.870> will<00:03:46.470> actually<00:03:46.829> get<00:03:46.950> this

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
new RAM disk and will actually get this

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.710 
new RAM disk and will actually get this
new<00:03:47.280> volume<00:03:47.459> to<00:03:47.820> show<00:03:48.000> up<00:03:48.090> here<00:03:48.269> in<00:03:48.299> a<00:03:48.390> moment

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
new volume to show up here in a moment

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.789 
new volume to show up here in a moment
I<00:03:50.180> believe<00:03:51.180> taking<00:03:51.570> 3<00:03:51.810> seconds<00:03:52.230> to<00:03:52.320> create<00:03:52.560> was

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
I believe taking 3 seconds to create was

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.620 
I believe taking 3 seconds to create was
a<00:03:52.920> little<00:03:53.130> too<00:03:53.250> long<00:03:53.400> judging<00:03:53.880> just<00:03:54.390> a<00:03:54.450> little

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
a little too long judging just a little

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.030 
a little too long judging just a little
bit<00:03:54.750> wanna<00:03:54.930> complain<00:03:55.260> about<00:03:55.440> the<00:03:55.650> time<00:03:55.829> lag

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
bit wanna complain about the time lag

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.890 
bit wanna complain about the time lag
there<00:03:56.280> on<00:03:56.459> three<00:03:56.670> seconds<00:03:57.090> I<00:03:57.180> don't<00:03:57.209> know<00:03:57.390> so

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
there on three seconds I don't know so

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.060 
there on three seconds I don't know so
we<00:03:58.019> can<00:03:58.140> see<00:03:58.290> right<00:03:58.440> here<00:03:58.500> that<00:03:58.829> we<00:03:58.920> actually

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
we can see right here that we actually

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.160 
we can see right here that we actually
have<00:03:59.340> have<00:03:59.579> d<00:04:00.000> out<00:04:00.269> an<00:04:00.510> actual<00:04:00.750> RAM<00:04:00.989> disk

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
have have d out an actual RAM disk

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.979 
have have d out an actual RAM disk
volume<00:04:01.560> okay<00:04:02.220> so<00:04:02.970> at<00:04:03.239> this<00:04:03.269> point<00:04:03.600> we<00:04:03.810> can<00:04:03.959> go

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
volume okay so at this point we can go

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.449 
volume okay so at this point we can go
ahead<00:04:04.109> and<00:04:04.320> just<00:04:04.410> minimize<00:04:04.739> the<00:04:04.859> software<00:04:05.280> and

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
ahead and just minimize the software and

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.670 
ahead and just minimize the software and
we<00:04:06.329> could<00:04:06.480> go<00:04:06.600> ahead<00:04:06.690> and<00:04:06.840> open<00:04:07.200> up<00:04:07.260> crystal

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
we could go ahead and open up crystal

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.550 
we could go ahead and open up crystal
disk<00:04:07.859> as<00:04:08.010> well<00:04:08.040> another<00:04:08.579> version<00:04:08.850> of<00:04:09.060> it<00:04:09.440> so<00:04:10.440> as

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
disk as well another version of it so as

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.050 
disk as well another version of it so as
we<00:04:10.680> can<00:04:10.799> see<00:04:11.040> here<00:04:11.220> we<00:04:11.310> now<00:04:11.430> have<00:04:11.579> the<00:04:11.700> initial

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
we can see here we now have the initial

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.270 
we can see here we now have the initial
benchmark<00:04:12.510> numbers<00:04:12.840> and<00:04:13.109> you<00:04:13.799> can<00:04:13.829> see<00:04:14.130> that

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
benchmark numbers and you can see that

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.410 
benchmark numbers and you can see that
we've<00:04:14.430> gotten<00:04:14.700> an<00:04:14.790> outstanding<00:04:15.329> level

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
we've gotten an outstanding level

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.969 
we've gotten an outstanding level
performance<00:04:15.720> right<00:04:16.200> the<00:04:16.350> baseline<00:04:16.739> already

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
performance right the baseline already

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:18.920 
performance right the baseline already
sequentially<00:04:17.609> we<00:04:17.850> can<00:04:17.970> see<00:04:18.120> on<00:04:18.329> our<00:04:18.359> run<00:04:18.660> core

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
sequentially we can see on our run core

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.250 
sequentially we can see on our run core
which<00:04:19.590> is<00:04:19.709> a<00:04:19.739> high<00:04:19.979> performance<00:04:20.220> mSATA<00:04:21.060> SSD

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
which is a high performance mSATA SSD

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260 
which is a high performance mSATA SSD
nothing<00:04:22.260> to<00:04:22.349> scoff<00:04:22.560> at<00:04:22.800> right<00:04:23.099> 235<00:04:23.909> megabytes

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
nothing to scoff at right 235 megabytes

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.940 
nothing to scoff at right 235 megabytes
for<00:04:24.419> the<00:04:24.510> read

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
for the read

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.500 
for the read
and<00:04:25.040> like<00:04:25.520> I<00:04:25.580> said<00:04:25.730> the<00:04:25.820> right<00:04:25.910> performance<00:04:26.090> is

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
and like I said the right performance is

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:27.670 
and like I said the right performance is
a<00:04:26.540> little<00:04:26.750> bit<00:04:26.870> under<00:04:27.020> because<00:04:27.260> it's<00:04:27.530> right

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
for your Photoshop well that would just

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.430 
for your Photoshop well that would just
be<00:05:14.120> simply<00:05:14.480> incredible<00:05:14.750> that<00:05:15.110> would<00:05:15.230> be<00:05:15.320> like

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
be simply incredible that would be like

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.510 
be simply incredible that would be like
one<00:05:15.590> of<00:05:15.680> the<00:05:15.740> best<00:05:15.890> ways<00:05:16.010> I<00:05:16.220> would<00:05:16.280> actually

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
one of the best ways I would actually

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.310 
one of the best ways I would actually
see<00:05:16.850> this<00:05:17.150> working<00:05:17.390> is<00:05:17.660> you<00:05:17.780> just<00:05:17.960> have<00:05:18.050> so

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
see this working is you just have so

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.780 
see this working is you just have so
much<00:05:18.440> bandwidth<00:05:18.950> to<00:05:19.100> work<00:05:19.250> with<00:05:19.430> your<00:05:19.670> vendor

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790 
much bandwidth to work with your vendor

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.940 
much bandwidth to work with your vendor
would<00:05:20.060> just<00:05:20.210> be<00:05:20.300> like<00:05:20.420> yeah<00:05:21.290> and<00:05:21.590> you<00:05:21.800> could

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:21.950 
would just be like yeah and you could

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:23.410 
would just be like yeah and you could
even<00:05:22.070> actually<00:05:22.490> have<00:05:22.640> the<00:05:22.790> benefit<00:05:23.180> of<00:05:23.210> having

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:23.420 
even actually have the benefit of having

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:24.970 
even actually have the benefit of having
multiple<00:05:23.990> RAM<00:05:24.200> disks<00:05:24.500> where<00:05:24.650> you<00:05:24.740> can<00:05:24.860> have

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:24.980 
multiple RAM disks where you can have

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.860 
multiple RAM disks where you can have
Photoshop<00:05:25.640> or<00:05:25.880> different<00:05:26.300> types<00:05:26.420> of<00:05:26.570> content

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870

programs<00:05:26.990> running<00:05:27.440> off<00:05:27.650> of<00:05:27.890> the<00:05:27.980> RAM<00:05:28.130> disk<00:05:28.280> and

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
programs running off of the RAM disk and

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.160 
programs running off of the RAM disk and
then<00:05:28.760> still<00:05:28.970> have<00:05:29.000> another<00:05:29.330> one<00:05:29.570> to<00:05:29.780> actually

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:30.170 
then still have another one to actually

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.980 
then still have another one to actually
run<00:05:30.320> as<00:05:30.560> your<00:05:30.800> actual<00:05:30.950> scratch<00:05:31.280> disk<00:05:31.610> so<00:05:32.210> you

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
run as your actual scratch disk so you

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.180 
run as your actual scratch disk so you
could<00:05:33.140> also<00:05:33.260> use<00:05:33.500> it<00:05:33.620> just<00:05:33.710> from<00:05:33.890> the<00:05:33.980> baseline

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
could also use it just from the baseline

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:35.740 
could also use it just from the baseline

clients or different types of office

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:38.860

applications<00:05:37.580> so<00:05:37.730> it's<00:05:38.090> really<00:05:38.240> up<00:05:38.450> to<00:05:38.480> you<00:05:38.720> in

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.030 
applications so it's really up to you in
terms<00:05:39.020> of<00:05:39.170> taking<00:05:39.410> advantage<00:05:39.590> of<00:05:39.830> the<00:05:39.920> high

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:42.350 
performance benefits of a ram disk it's

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.920 
performance benefits of a ram disk it's
really<00:05:42.680> amazing<00:05:43.100> how<00:05:43.520> fast<00:05:43.940> these<00:05:44.330> speeds<00:05:44.690> are

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:44.930 
really amazing how fast these speeds are

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.750 
really amazing how fast these speeds are
so<00:05:45.380> I<00:05:45.410> know<00:05:45.620> that<00:05:45.740> a<00:05:45.950> lot<00:05:46.130> of<00:05:46.160> people<00:05:46.520> out<00:05:46.700> there

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
so I know that a lot of people out there

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.420 
so I know that a lot of people out there
have<00:05:47.270> not<00:05:47.510> really<00:05:47.840> noticed<00:05:48.620> this<00:05:48.770> technology

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
have not really noticed this technology

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:50.800 
have not really noticed this technology
or<00:05:49.550> they<00:05:49.640> haven't<00:05:49.850> really<00:05:50.030> grasped<00:05:50.450> onto<00:05:50.600> it

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
or they haven't really grasped onto it

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.140

yet<00:05:50.990> but<00:05:51.230> as<00:05:51.380> the<00:05:51.890> memory<00:05:52.220> density<00:05:52.670> grows<00:05:52.910> and

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
yet but as the memory density grows and

yet but as the memory density grows and
memory<00:05:53.330> becomes<00:05:53.570> lower<00:05:53.810> lower<00:05:54.080> and<00:05:54.230> price

this<00:05:54.770> is<00:05:54.920> going<00:05:55.130> to<00:05:55.220> be<00:05:55.310> a<00:05:55.340> technology<00:05:55.790> that

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090 
this is going to be a technology that

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:57.310 
this is going to be a technology that
you're<00:05:56.270> really<00:05:56.450> going<00:05:56.720> to<00:05:56.810> want<00:05:56.870> to<00:05:57.080> take<00:05:57.260> a

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:57.320 
you're really going to want to take a

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.150 
you're really going to want to take a
look<00:05:57.650> at<00:05:57.860> today<00:05:58.220> we<00:05:58.820> use<00:05:59.030> this<00:05:59.180> a<00:05:59.240> 16<00:05:59.810> gigabyte

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 
look at today we use this a 16 gigabyte

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.560 
look at today we use this a 16 gigabyte
configuration<00:06:01.160> now<00:06:01.670> this<00:06:01.880> can<00:06:02.030> go<00:06:02.150> all<00:06:02.390> the

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:02.570 
configuration now this can go all the

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.690 
configuration now this can go all the
way<00:06:02.600> up<00:06:02.810> to<00:06:02.960> a<00:06:03.020> 64<00:06:03.620> gigabyte<00:06:03.830> configuration

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:04.700 
way up to a 64 gigabyte configuration

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:05.890 
way up to a 64 gigabyte configuration
