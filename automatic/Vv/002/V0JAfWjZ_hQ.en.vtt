00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.770
 hello friends my remodeling beautiful 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:08.800
 that he wants to see you this episode 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:11.230
 and of course I'm happy about that 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.420
 stand of refitting report you can 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.370
 First, I want you a few 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.940
 Pictures with the results of my 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.800
 recent gravel work points up 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.490
 I do not want to grow up that way 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.039
 enter 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.109
 only so much over the gravel in the 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.359
 center of the circle can be greatly diluted 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:30.580
 cold cross-country skiing and on the sides 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:33.750
 I use latex binders which 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.370
 Dilute one to one with water 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.130
 I bring the glue with a 10 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.110
 cubic centimeter large syringe with the 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:43.380
 a 1 millimeter needle embroidered 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.080
 is very beneficial in doing that 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:49.559
 previous spray the bulkhead with 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:52.230
 water the areas between the tracks 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.980
 will be his later date 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.980
 something upgraded 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:01.200
 Well, the first attempts were still 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.310
 it is a bit difficult now 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.310
 already quite good by the hand 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.280
 a second construction site concerns the 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.560
 Representation of the plant why must the 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.440
 signals and soft only so much 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.230
 connection turned occupy and applies 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:21.250
 it now reasonably reasonable too 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.720
 arrange and guide 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.300
 but before I can begin 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.660
 are still available old connection 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.250
 to remove trede 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:34.220
 now with the spread of the plant 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.550
 shows another advantage the 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.229
 were to simply fold 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:42.619
 Of course that makes things much easier 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.720
 My plan as I also largely 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.780
 all connection turned through the plate 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:51.759
 I have now also the 1 and 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.759
 2 bolt in emergency 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.660
 but first I'll take care of the new one 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.460
 showing the lighting has been this 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.310
 so far over toggle switch on the ground 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:04.910
 she should design in the future on 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.040
 Turn off the switchboard 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.410
 to check if I have the right connection 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.330
 have turned out together or 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.050
 track on tilted and with a prop 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.660
 held 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:18.130
 so I could see if that too 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.130
 lights up what should shine 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.990
 as the 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.930
 I could be assigned again 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.660
 soft and signals represented the 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.420
 individual carriers are going through 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.750
 small chapels held or in the canal 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.750
 relocated 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.140
 Now I come to the third construction site 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.090
 The room also used as a guest room 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.140
 I would have a cover 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.569
 to come up with 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.360
 i made these with help 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.340
 two 9mm chipboard I with 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.739
 even every film has covered 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.319
 both plates will be down in each case 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.750
 Two angles used and over magnets 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.730
 any held 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.490
 the fourth construction site is mine 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.070
 Dedicated to the console as you can see 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:29.030
 There are also some changes here 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.500
 but I will in due time 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.360
 to report 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.490
 To conclude, an abstract from the 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.560
 interview with my model prime 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:40.200
 minister 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.950
 Mr. Minister, how long will she think 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:46.980
 still be locked the system 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:50.940
 well so they know I, I would sometimes 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:53.880
 so they say they can 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:57.260
 yes convince and I think we are 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.260
 on the right way 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:03.350
 thanks to the model railway minister this will 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.350
 insightful conversation
