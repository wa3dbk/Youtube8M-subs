00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:11.650
 in this episode of hardware info tv 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.650
 the best digital my cloud 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.250
 welcome to hardware info tv western 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.800
 digital has a new nas 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.360
 called the my cloud it's not one 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.400
 authors who know most of the others 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.989
 manufacturers because he is not overflowing 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.939
 functionality but is very bad 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:33.769
 user-friendly and very affordable 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.870
 Well here maybe sometimes he stands with 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:38.030
 start that affordable because it costs 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.500
 but 140 euros for a device then 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.850
 immediately had a two against by skins 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.860
 yes that is approximately amount where 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.329
 some other manufacturer that actually 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.320
 just starting with purchasing 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.420
 the of a nas 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.190
 an empty box indeed here he is 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.720
 look in advance this is not a nuisance word 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.549
 I released could not be downloaded anymore 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.010
 install apps 

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:56.180
 et cetera et cetera this is a pure name 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.530
 to share files 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.530
 easy to access through it 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.689
 internet and yes via itunes for example 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.010
 or distributor after playing your files 

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:05.990
 for the reasonable the none 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.060
 competition for the final jeans and the 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.200
 qnap smartly started with a pen of money already 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.180
 almost actually this is green and like 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.590
 friend school indeed or as you say 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.090
 through good look i would like one like you 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.470
 and I want some files on it 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.909
 can share what photoshop can share 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.330
 then this is also a lot of fun 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.300
 product 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.680
 yes certainly because of the price yes the 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.580
 performance and also pretty good that was in 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.020
 Past still a bit of a 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.510
 problem with knives this chair yes that 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.230
 overnight had about 60 70 megabytes per 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.490
 second 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.930
 they spoke for performance is this 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.940
 totally good and it's especially easy 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.550
 via I already at the installation 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.270
 yes but that we start with that 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:39.530
 installation starts green with a 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.909
 program that automatically recognizes him and 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.790
 what you and i will be here if fill 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.650
 ready and step by step for installation 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.900
 watch and once you get started 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.100
 then you can also access immediately 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.080
 going to make to different 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.580
 users coming from the internet 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.710
 have access to the device 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.780
 and all receive their own brochure 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.490
 on the nas mine like you too right away 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.080
 looks on the image yes it goes there too 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.180
 because you are therefore also outside of your own 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.799
 network from example your laptop from 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.120
 your tablet from your mobile phone 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.650
 have access to the device 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.119
 that's why they have to call me my balls 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.560
 Do you want him to be a who's hip 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.480
 being is wanting on that band in which 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.400
 but the concept is really green 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.840
 makes it as easy as possible for you 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.580
 which device you always use 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.500
 just access your files and yes 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.150
 that's right 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.319
 the web interface here is not fair 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.879
 its main screen is one 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.349
 some really different or confessing 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.819
 for example in the finals that go through on the 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:28.489
 qnap yourself went 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.719
 new functionality is clear 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.760
 a limited number of things but that quite 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:34.099
 good but I just really like him 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.450
 well-arranged yes and as you see yourself 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.639
 immediately notice how much space 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.469
 is still available 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:40.609
 how many users are something afterwards? 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:41.959
 important in this case had to be one 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:43.969
 new firmware installed for wire 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.069
 it is also very clearly indicated 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:47.329
 so yes this is this is yes it is it is 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.739
 indeed not very extensive but it is 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:49.489
 very well-arranged and to continue 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.569
 go or that point of 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.409
 user friendliness after the 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.909
 installation 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:54.530
 and send you to the website immediately 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:56.359
 from West Digital fairly immediately 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.469
 learn how to get all that feature time out there 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:58.519
 you can use it sometimes 

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:00.469
 for example, you can make a backup 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.760
 corners system icloud things work 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:02.930
 which they have for years look at that is 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.609
 very uncluttered me that is maybe 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.319
 For someone who is already very experience 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:07.489
 via where and then difficult with that 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.870
 if you don't have much experience with it 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.280
 then this is very handy 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.480
 they also offer an app for example 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.189
 windows well then you can very easily 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.540
 if you have it outside your network 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:15.680
 connect to the thing 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.269
 you can also access via the web 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.250
 that looks about the same and 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.480
 then you see this my cloud for example 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.250
 but suppose you have several of these 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.659
 devices well we see them neatly 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.959
 standing next to each other but in front of the 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:28.669
 clarity you are dealing with this so if 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.409
 you are somewhere else with your laptop 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:33.680
 Knocked books in the McDonald's via WiFi 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:35.689
 network you are going to the wessel 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.310
 cloud through my website that you log in with 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:39.889
 your account and then it becomes instant 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.930
 automatic link made with you 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:43.699
 my cloud at home is yes it can 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.689
 so also go through this this they this piece 

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:46.280
 software then is a bit dependent 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:48.290
 of what you want to do 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.790
 so here you can immediately see the access 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.530
 to it to it to the directories on it 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.000
 device and you can just at such as 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.079
 You actually call that on him regular PC 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.810
 could also simply be really one 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:58.159
 connect as if it were a folder 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.650
 is on your PC at that time 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:02.180
 yes and then this story got safe points 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.090
 you can make because the mike has blade 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.739
 but a hard disk in it so yes 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.650
 by definition did not drive and the ndng as 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:12.680
 that one disc leaves life then is in 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.209
 in fact the data disappeared but luckily 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.459
 there are good possibilities 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.630
 yet to make backups of your nas yes 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.459
 look the best is of course several 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.659
 disks to have more good they piece one 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.610
 bit dependent on the price of the 

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:24.680
 club after oriental around 140 euros for this 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.360
 2 terabytes of output so it's hard to 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.430
 young writes to do 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.110
 on the back is a usb connection with 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.580
 ran the 0 shutter an external hard 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.560
 disc or posts in the 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:37.550
 and quickly browse under a backup 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:39.349
 that disk yes and then apps because that's that 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.550
 or works well in windows that's what 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:42.319
 that is special for sneezing because that 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.050
 everyone does as well 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:47.240
 but also things like iphone is android 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.560
 all neatly arranged 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.659
 yes look you have the my cloud apps here 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.490
 He had two apps and cloud my but and 

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:54.680
 weather photo forging specific to it 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.240
 it for viewing photos and this 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.860
 is the my cloud app and that's how funny 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.300
 dibi therefore also a link with 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.979
 popular cloud services 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.280
 for example dropbox look where in google 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:03.080
 drive 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.120
 and then you can also file them between you 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.190
 google drive and exchange your my cloud 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.229
 that can be handy if you go through my 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.389
 clamps my closet 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:13.069
 my my disk where is full for a while 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:14.449
 some files to the third to the me 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:15.949
 bring cloud or vice versa if you have that 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:17.180
 want to share easily via that service and 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:19.159
 for the work that is possible in an in 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.110
 same app yes and if you don't 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:23.029
 have an app sit on the mark fairy tale 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.620
 that would really not be possible on your iphone 

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:26.569
 if you have an app from 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.699
 of the nose and you for example 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:30.439
 a dropbox there are no options then 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:31.819
 normally other has to hide in and 

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:33.199
 Apple on Android is also not 

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:34.909
 super easy to do that 

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:36.050
 so yes this is quite a thing in itself 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:38.000
 very practical in the well thought out 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.889
 and and unique what we do not have 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.810
 seen with other nicolas and as 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:43.400
 provider and I watch those wwf photos that 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.650
 is really specific for viewing 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.940
 of photos in people below than below 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.469
 other the ability to easily falls 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.240
 can be shared with others and again 

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:52.789
 of course the focus is your smartphone 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.469
 makes the ehealth and copy it 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:55.310
 this is also included with this is wd smartware 

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:57.349
 pro 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.150
 his backup package is very simple 

00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:00.740
 very simple very logical but it 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.889
 Funny thing is that he has every possibility 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.310
 to also dropbox pieces 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:07.669
 backup 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.900
 yes i have if it so view it anyway 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:10.729
 feeling that they are average half 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.139
 info reader will not buy this products 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:13.849
 that is with downloading anyway 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:15.349
 and just let him get things started 

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:17.089
 want but no then you will still be whole 

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:19.219
 back to 

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:21.229
 then if that we indeed may be you 

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:23.419
 drop mother in law or with acquaintances 

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:25.310
 those less technologically advanced 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:25.969
 they simply have to do this themselves 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.500
 get started 

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:28.879
 yes you can and I can 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.229
 imagine if you might be a little older 

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:31.669
 suffer or you say yes because of the 

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:33.289
 I'd rather not have safety 

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:34.610
 all the cloud services on my on my 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:36.710
 nars because yes that is also a bit the 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.120
 ask if you want that then this is also 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.889
 very interesting solution if 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.330
 externally if you're sure because of the price 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:42.470
 yes, because you don't have to for that price 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.880
 to leave 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.950
 and with that the end of this 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.740
 delivery of heartily info TV 

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:50.240
 Monday Wednesday and Friday those are the 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.750
 3 days that we have new episodes 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.580
 to have 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:55.820
 thank you for looking and hearing 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:57.500
 time again that is one of the 

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.540
 hours of use models that is quite whole 

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:01.940
 very nice if you look then there is also 

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:04.190
 at the bottom of a tripod connection 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.540
 youth council 

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.590
 so you can also put it on a monopod 

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:08.450
 and then at a concert or something 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:10.130
 such that things just 2 meters the 

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:12.020
 air in and then very unique 

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:16.060
 get an overview or if you have one 

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:16.060
