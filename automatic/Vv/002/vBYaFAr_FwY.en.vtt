you compare them to anything else in

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.189 
you compare them to anything else in
that<00:00:54.120> price<00:00:54.390> range<00:00:54.539> it's<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.320> bargain<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:57.199> you

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199

their top tower
flagship<00:02:10.560> tower<00:02:10.830> now<00:02:12.890> this<00:02:13.890> driver<00:02:14.130> uses<00:02:14.430> a

completely different magnetic structure

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.900 
completely different magnetic structure
it's<00:02:16.349> I<00:02:16.650> forget<00:02:16.980> how<00:02:17.099> many<00:02:17.310> but<00:02:17.550> I<00:02:17.580> think<00:02:17.790> it's

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
it's I forget how many but I think it's

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.420 
it's I forget how many but I think it's
like<00:02:18.030> 17<00:02:18.569> claw<00:02:18.900> shaped<00:02:19.230> magnets<00:02:19.709> that<00:02:20.310> all

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
like 17 claw shaped magnets that all

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.640 
like 17 claw shaped magnets that all
have<00:02:20.580> to<00:02:20.730> be<00:02:20.819> placed<00:02:21.120> very<00:02:21.300> precisely<00:02:21.930> and

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
have to be placed very precisely and

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.490 
have to be placed very precisely and
they<00:02:22.770> get<00:02:22.920> a<00:02:22.950> really<00:02:23.340> high<00:02:23.370> magnetic<00:02:24.180> flux<00:02:24.660> in

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
they get a really high magnetic flux in

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.460 
they get a really high magnetic flux in
the<00:02:25.890> voice<00:02:26.280> coil<00:02:26.520> gap<00:02:26.790> so<00:02:27.209> very<00:02:28.140> strong

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
the voice coil gap so very strong

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.970 
the voice coil gap so very strong
response<00:02:29.090> it's<00:02:30.090> you<00:02:30.959> know<00:02:31.050> really<00:02:31.530> well<00:02:31.650> the

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
response it's you know really well the

response it's you know really well the
the<00:02:32.190> woofer<00:02:32.430> is<00:02:32.550> really<00:02:32.910> well<00:02:33.030> controlled<00:02:34.580> the

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
the woofer is really well controlled the

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.990 
the woofer is really well controlled the
couple<00:02:36.360> unique<00:02:36.630> things<00:02:36.930> here<00:02:37.080> though<00:02:37.500> the

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
couple unique things here though the

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.610 
couple unique things here though the
woofers<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.330> first<00:02:39.569> design<00:02:40.080> I've<00:02:40.230> ever<00:02:40.440> heard

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
woofers the first design I've ever heard

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.030 
woofers the first design I've ever heard
of<00:02:40.739> the<00:02:41.010> woofer<00:02:41.310> does<00:02:41.459> not<00:02:41.670> use<00:02:41.849> any<00:02:42.060> crossover

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
of the woofer does not use any crossover

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.949 
of the woofer does not use any crossover
components<00:02:44.040> on<00:02:44.370> it<00:02:44.400> so<00:02:45.000> it<00:02:45.360> gets<00:02:45.569> full<00:02:45.720> range

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
components on it so it gets full range

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.850 
components on it so it gets full range
signal<00:02:46.380> so<00:02:47.160> that<00:02:47.550> gives<00:02:47.970> you<00:02:48.269> the<00:02:48.860> absolute

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860

in the crossover that's a place where a

in the crossover that's a place where a
lot<00:03:16.950> of<00:03:17.010> other<00:03:17.190> companies<00:03:18.120> will<00:03:18.780> cheap<00:03:19.140> out<00:03:19.380> on

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
lot of other companies will cheap out on

because<00:03:20.220> you<00:03:20.340> don't<00:03:20.489> see<00:03:20.730> it<00:03:21.140> you<00:03:22.140> know<00:03:22.230> how<00:03:22.470> we

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
because you don't see it you know how we

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.259 
because you don't see it you know how we
can<00:03:22.680> save<00:03:22.859> some<00:03:23.040> cost<00:03:23.250> here<00:03:23.579> because<00:03:23.970> nobody

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
can save some cost here because nobody

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:25.310 
can save some cost here because nobody
will<00:03:24.510> know<00:03:24.570> the<00:03:24.690> difference<00:03:24.780> anyway

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
will know the difference anyway

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.410 
will know the difference anyway
well<00:03:26.100> totem<00:03:26.459> thinks<00:03:26.790> he's<00:03:26.970> will<00:03:27.209> know<00:03:27.390> a

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
well totem thinks he's will know a

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.819 
well totem thinks he's will know a
difference<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:28.109> you'll<00:03:28.260> hear<00:03:28.500> it<00:03:28.530> with<00:03:28.799> your

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
difference and you'll hear it with your

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.340 
difference and you'll hear it with your
ears<00:03:29.010> and<00:03:29.700> and<00:03:30.329> they're<00:03:30.570> right<00:03:30.780> because<00:03:31.140> when

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
ears and and they're right because when

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.430 
ears and and they're right because when
you<00:03:31.470> hear<00:03:31.680> them<00:03:31.829> you<00:03:32.070> can't<00:03:32.640> believe<00:03:32.910> it

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
you hear them you can't believe it

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.750 
you hear them you can't believe it
so<00:03:35.130> anyway<00:03:36.890> we<00:03:37.890> have<00:03:38.160> they<00:03:38.370> come<00:03:38.489> in<00:03:38.549> two

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
so anyway we have they come in two

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.539 
so anyway we have they come in two
finishes<00:03:39.060> you<00:03:39.959> get<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.769> polyester<00:03:41.160> gloss

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
finishes you get the the polyester gloss

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.900 
finishes you get the the polyester gloss
finishes<00:03:41.940> for<00:03:42.630> coat<00:03:42.870> process<00:03:43.470> we<00:03:44.250> have<00:03:44.430> the

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
finishes for coat process we have the

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.440 
finishes for coat process we have the
piano<00:03:45.120> white<00:03:45.390> and<00:03:45.630> the<00:03:45.780> piano<00:03:46.079> black<00:03:47.269> it's<00:03:48.269> not

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
piano white and the piano black it's not

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.090 
piano white and the piano black it's not
an<00:03:48.720> upcharge<00:03:49.019> in<00:03:49.230> a<00:03:49.320> series<00:03:49.680> because<00:03:49.980> they

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
an upcharge in a series because they

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.800 
an upcharge in a series because they
only<00:03:50.250> come<00:03:50.489> in<00:03:50.519> the<00:03:50.760> gloss<00:03:50.940> finishes<00:03:51.390> so

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
only come in the gloss finishes so

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.220 
only come in the gloss finishes so
that's<00:03:52.170> as<00:03:52.530> standard<00:03:53.750> the<00:03:54.750> difference

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
that's as standard the difference

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.319 
that's as standard the difference
between<00:03:55.410> the<00:03:56.040> earth<00:03:56.340> which<00:03:56.730> this<00:03:57.030> is<00:03:57.209> the

good<00:04:21.570> they<00:04:22.440> recommend

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
good they recommend

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.810 
good they recommend
power<00:04:23.550> between<00:04:24.680> 50<00:04:25.680> to<00:04:25.919> 200<00:04:26.400> watts

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.990 
power between 50 to 200 watts
I<00:04:27.210> recommend<00:04:28.310> 200<00:04:29.310> watts<00:04:29.460> if<00:04:29.639> you<00:04:29.729> can<00:04:29.850> do<00:04:29.970> it

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
I recommend 200 watts if you can do it

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.920 
I recommend 200 watts if you can do it
or<00:04:30.240> more<00:04:31.550> you<00:04:32.550> know<00:04:32.669> better<00:04:33.419> to<00:04:33.570> have<00:04:33.720> that

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
or more you know better to have that

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.570 
or more you know better to have that
Headroom<00:04:34.320> and<00:04:34.530> have<00:04:34.680> more<00:04:34.979> control<00:04:35.280> over<00:04:35.370> the

Headroom and have more control over the

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.730 
Headroom and have more control over the

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
speaker in my opinion with tube amps you

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.320 
speaker in my opinion with tube amps you
can<00:04:37.860> get<00:04:37.949> away<00:04:38.039> with<00:04:38.310> a<00:04:38.340> bit<00:04:38.610> lower<00:04:38.789> power<00:04:39.120> out

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
can get away with a bit lower power out

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.140 
can get away with a bit lower power out
of<00:04:39.449> them<00:04:39.600> but<00:04:40.070> in<00:04:41.070> any<00:04:41.310> case<00:04:41.430> you<00:04:41.850> want<00:04:42.060> you

of them but in any case you want you

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.939 
of them but in any case you want you
want<00:04:42.360> to<00:04:42.389> have<00:04:42.570> a<00:04:42.600> good<00:04:42.870> current<00:04:43.199> carrying

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
point of lose 31 hurts so good strong

point of lose 31 hurts so good strong
bass<00:05:01.680> response<00:05:01.860> out<00:05:02.310> of<00:05:02.430> them<00:05:02.580> you<00:05:03.120> don't<00:05:03.300> need

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:03.539 
bass response out of them you don't need

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:05.629 
bass response out of them you don't need
a<00:05:03.570> subwoofer<00:05:04.020> but<00:05:04.560> you<00:05:04.830> could<00:05:05.039> certainly<00:05:05.220> add

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 
a subwoofer but you could certainly add

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.310 
a subwoofer but you could certainly add
one<00:05:05.880> if<00:05:06.030> you<00:05:06.150> really<00:05:06.539> wanted<00:05:06.780> to<00:05:06.900> get<00:05:07.020> some

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
one if you really wanted to get some

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.270 
one if you really wanted to get some
deep<00:05:07.470> bass<00:05:07.740> extension<00:05:08.280> out<00:05:08.370> of<00:05:08.490> it<00:05:09.979> and<00:05:10.979> they

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
deep bass extension out of it and they

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.240 
deep bass extension out of it and they
play<00:05:11.669> plenty<00:05:12.030> loud<00:05:12.180> to<00:05:12.479> the<00:05:13.350> the<00:05:13.770> element

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
play plenty loud to the the element

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.290 
play plenty loud to the the element
series<00:05:14.639> in<00:05:14.820> general<00:05:16.250> unlike<00:05:17.250> some<00:05:18.000> of<00:05:18.150> the

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
series in general unlike some of the

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.750 
series in general unlike some of the
smaller<00:05:18.840> to<00:05:19.289> wait<00:05:19.500> hours<00:05:19.919> they<00:05:20.190> have<00:05:20.430> is

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
smaller to wait hours they have is

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.800 
smaller to wait hours they have is
really<00:05:21.210> designed<00:05:21.449> to<00:05:22.699> to<00:05:23.699> fill<00:05:24.000> a<00:05:24.270> big<00:05:24.539> space

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
really designed to to fill a big space

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.540 
really designed to to fill a big space
to<00:05:25.139> do<00:05:25.259> home<00:05:25.470> theaters<00:05:25.889> to<00:05:26.099> do<00:05:26.250> bigger

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
to do home theaters to do bigger

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.360 
to do home theaters to do bigger
dynamics<00:05:27.270> to<00:05:28.229> really<00:05:28.440> rock<00:05:28.650> out<00:05:28.830> a<00:05:28.889> bit<00:05:29.190> more

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
dynamics to really rock out a bit more

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.510 
dynamics to really rock out a bit more
you<00:05:30.000> know<00:05:30.030> so<00:05:30.419> they'll<00:05:30.810> certainly<00:05:31.020> do<00:05:31.349> it<00:05:31.520> this

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
you know so they'll certainly do it this

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.930 
you know so they'll certainly do it this
the<00:05:33.210> woofer<00:05:33.570> actually<00:05:34.199> these<00:05:34.440> have<00:05:34.650> a<00:05:34.940> one

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
the woofer actually these have a one

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.899 
the woofer actually these have a one
inch<00:05:36.120> throw<00:05:36.449> one<00:05:36.780> inch<00:05:36.960> xmax<00:05:37.410> which<00:05:38.280> you<00:05:38.789> know

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:38.909 
inch throw one inch xmax which you know

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:41.330 
inch throw one inch xmax which you know
that's<00:05:39.090> that's<00:05:39.570> like<00:05:39.720> sub<00:05:40.110> woofer<00:05:40.470> throw<00:05:40.979> and

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
that's that's like sub woofer throw and

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.730 
that's that's like sub woofer throw and
that's<00:05:42.030> like<00:05:42.270> 10<00:05:42.780> or<00:05:42.900> 12<00:05:42.930> inch<00:05:43.289> sub<00:05:43.500> woofer

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
that's like 10 or 12 inch sub woofer

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.920 
that's like 10 or 12 inch sub woofer
kind<00:05:43.949> of<00:05:44.039> throw<00:05:44.310> so<00:05:44.669> this<00:05:44.970> this<00:05:45.510> does<00:05:45.690> it<00:05:45.810> on<00:05:45.900> a

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
kind of throw so this this does it on a

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.480 
kind of throw so this this does it on a
7<00:05:46.289> inch<00:05:46.409> woofer<00:05:46.710> so<00:05:46.860> that's<00:05:47.010> a<00:05:47.099> lot<00:05:47.310> of

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
7 inch woofer so that's a lot of

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.260 
7 inch woofer so that's a lot of
extension<00:05:48.770> so<00:05:49.770> 1<00:05:50.099> 7<00:05:50.400> inch<00:05:50.520> woofer<00:05:50.789> can<00:05:50.940> really

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
extension so 1 7 inch woofer can really

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.360 
extension so 1 7 inch woofer can really
move<00:05:51.389> a<00:05:51.510> lot<00:05:51.659> of<00:05:51.810> error<00:05:51.990> if<00:05:52.260> you<00:05:52.470> if<00:05:52.889> you<00:05:53.099> really

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
move a lot of error if you if you really

these<00:06:00.120> is<00:06:00.270> is<00:06:00.539> low<00:06:00.870> I<00:06:01.169> I'm<00:06:01.650> not<00:06:01.949> sure<00:06:02.280> I

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
these is is low I I'm not sure I

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:03.770 
these is is low I I'm not sure I
remember<00:06:02.490> offhand<00:06:02.849> exactly<00:06:03.419> but<00:06:03.539> it's<00:06:03.659> like

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 
remember offhand exactly but it's like

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.879 
remember offhand exactly but it's like
17<00:06:04.320> Hertz<00:06:04.650> or<00:06:04.949> 16<00:06:05.430> Hertz<00:06:05.639> something<00:06:06.120> like<00:06:06.300> that

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:06.889 
17 Hertz or 16 Hertz something like that

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:09.589 
17 Hertz or 16 Hertz something like that

feet that actually has an adjustment for

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.420 
feet that actually has an adjustment for
height<00:06:59.990> so<00:07:00.229> you<00:07:00.259> can<00:07:00.500> adjust<00:07:00.830> the<00:07:00.889> tilt<00:07:01.100> on<00:07:01.340> the

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:01.430 
height so you can adjust the tilt on the

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:06.779 
height so you can adjust the tilt on the
speaker<00:07:01.789> and<00:07:03.370> the<00:07:04.370> whole<00:07:04.669> cabinet<00:07:05.210> has<00:07:06.050> an

speaker and the whole cabinet has an
angled<00:07:07.789> construction<00:07:08.300> almost<00:07:08.539> looks<00:07:08.690> like<00:07:08.750> an

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:08.930 
angled construction almost looks like an

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:10.870 
angled construction almost looks like an
obelisk<00:07:09.229> here<00:07:09.650> but<00:07:09.949> there's<00:07:10.460> no<00:07:10.580> parallel

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:10.880 
obelisk here but there's no parallel

obelisk here but there's no parallel
surfaces<00:07:11.599> in<00:07:11.750> the<00:07:11.840> cabinet<00:07:12.289> it's<00:07:13.130> all<00:07:13.310> lack

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:13.520 
surfaces in the cabinet it's all lack

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.490 
surfaces in the cabinet it's all lack
miter<00:07:13.789> together<00:07:14.210> so<00:07:14.690> it's<00:07:14.930> going<00:07:15.110> to<00:07:15.169> be<00:07:15.320> good

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:15.500 
miter together so it's going to be good

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.370 
miter together so it's going to be good
for<00:07:15.800> years<00:07:16.550> and<00:07:16.759> years<00:07:16.940> to<00:07:17.090> come<00:07:17.380> with

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:18.380 
for years and years to come with

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.200 
for years and years to come with
temperature<00:07:18.770> changes<00:07:18.800> humidity<00:07:19.639> changes<00:07:19.880> and

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:20.210 
temperature changes humidity changes and

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:21.580 
temperature changes humidity changes and
all<00:07:20.270> that<00:07:20.479> they<00:07:20.690> designed<00:07:21.020> their<00:07:21.139> products<00:07:21.470> to

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:21.590 
all that they designed their products to

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:25.980 
all that they designed their products to
last<00:07:21.770> a<00:07:21.949> long<00:07:22.099> time<00:07:22.160> so<00:07:23.560> it's<00:07:24.560> a<00:07:24.590> very<00:07:24.800> very

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:25.990 
last a long time so it's a very very

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:29.050 
last a long time so it's a very very
inert<00:07:26.990> structure<00:07:27.590> to<00:07:27.860> build<00:07:28.039> to<00:07:28.789> build<00:07:28.970> a

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:29.060 
inert structure to build to build a

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.749 
inert structure to build to build a
