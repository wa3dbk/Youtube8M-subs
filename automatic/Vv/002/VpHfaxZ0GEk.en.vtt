are the differences

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.590 
are the differences
basically<00:01:31.340> they're<00:01:31.610> almost<00:01:32.030> exactly<00:01:32.480> the

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
basically they're almost exactly the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.380 
basically they're almost exactly the
same<00:01:32.690> besides<00:01:33.290> the<00:01:33.950> 100<00:01:34.460> is<00:01:34.760> a<00:01:34.820> longer<00:01:35.150> swing

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
same besides the 100 is a longer swing

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.900 
same besides the 100 is a longer swing
arm<00:01:35.660> of<00:01:35.750> course<00:01:35.960> and<00:01:36.650> has<00:01:37.010> a<00:01:37.040> longer<00:01:37.610> chalk

other<00:01:38.180> than<00:01:38.270> that<00:01:38.420> they're<00:01:38.660> exactly<00:01:39.320> the<00:01:39.440> same

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
other than that they're exactly the same

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.499 
other than that they're exactly the same
both<00:01:41.450> these<00:01:41.600> bikes<00:01:41.810> are

both these bikes are

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:45.390 
both these bikes are
basically<00:01:44.290> same<00:01:44.500> bike<00:01:44.710> just<00:01:44.950> this<00:01:45.070> one's<00:01:45.310> a

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
basically same bike just this one's a

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.550 
basically same bike just this one's a
little<00:01:45.520> bit<00:01:45.729> larger<00:01:46.119> for<00:01:46.299> a<00:01:46.780> little<00:01:47.470> bit

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
little bit larger for a little bit

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.210 
little bit larger for a little bit
larger<00:01:47.860> rider<00:01:48.330> okay<00:01:49.330> and<00:01:49.479> I<00:01:49.540> see<00:01:50.020> it<00:01:50.860> tells<00:01:51.100> you

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
larger rider okay and I see it tells you

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.710 
larger rider okay and I see it tells you
it's<00:01:51.369> a<00:01:51.430> full-on<00:01:51.670> motocross<00:01:52.210> bike<00:01:52.450> when<00:01:52.659> you

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
it's a full-on motocross bike when you

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.660 
it's a full-on motocross bike when you
look<00:01:52.869> at<00:01:52.990> the<00:01:53.080> type<00:01:53.259> of<00:01:53.290> brake<00:01:53.619> lever<00:01:53.920> you<00:01:54.549> know

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
look at the type of brake lever you know

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.429 
look at the type of brake lever you know
over<00:01:54.970> the<00:01:55.090> peg<00:01:55.299> and<00:01:55.540> the<00:01:55.630> serious<00:01:55.990> foot<00:01:56.170> pegs

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
over the peg and the serious foot pegs

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:58.109 
over the peg and the serious foot pegs
they're<00:01:56.680> running<00:01:56.950> here<00:01:57.130> and<00:01:57.640> I<00:01:57.700> guess<00:01:57.909> this

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
they're running here and I guess this

00:01:58.119 --> 00:01:59.760 
they're running here and I guess this
black<00:01:58.420> treatment<00:01:58.840> is<00:01:58.930> just<00:01:59.020> a<00:01:59.229> proline<00:01:59.710> or

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
black treatment is just a proline or

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.219 
black treatment is just a proline or
having<00:02:00.399> it<00:02:00.460> no<00:02:00.610> way<00:02:00.789> the<00:02:01.030> onine<00:02:01.780> this<00:02:01.990> there's

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
having it no way the onine this there's

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.590 
having it no way the onine this there's
a<00:02:02.289> black<00:02:02.500> treatment<00:02:02.950> and<00:02:03.190> our<00:02:03.549> guard<00:02:04.240> up<00:02:04.390> here

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
a black treatment and our guard up here

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.420 
a black treatment and our guard up here
so<00:02:04.869> when<00:02:05.020> I<00:02:05.200> got<00:02:05.470> the<00:02:05.619> black<00:02:05.799> treatment<00:02:06.340> which

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
so when I got the black treatment which

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.100 
so when I got the black treatment which
I<00:02:06.520> think<00:02:06.939> really<00:02:07.090> looks<00:02:07.450> good<00:02:07.689> I<00:02:07.720> was<00:02:07.960> yeah
