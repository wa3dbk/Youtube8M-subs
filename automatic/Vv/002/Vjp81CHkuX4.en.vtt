00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.760
 after the matches please look 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.779
 his nozzle cleaning today 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:21.929
 Yes, I think you still need to win 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:23.970
 best long builds more 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:26.849
 viewed through collective shouts and 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:31.710
 fight on every part guys sit 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:37.910
 not bad, I played the boss hurt 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:41.130
 whitish didn't mean a connected so we 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.910
 found in one net and attack leaving 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.250
 such a 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.250
 and the final stage 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.020
 but of course it's insulting to lose when 90 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.710
 you spend everything in attack 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.430
 a lot of course attacked the moments created 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.960
 civilizations of course sometime with us 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:13.280
 an opponent must show for such a bad 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:29.930
 the implementation of new on it is tested 15 not 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:35.030
 more and adjust the taste to of course 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:40.670
 Muscovite went into this lan for a moment 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:44.390
 all yours could have created thanks yet 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:48.259
 1000 times the whole macro for shura 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.930
 temperature food dragon morning feet 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.600
 so I had some permutations 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.470
 make up misha 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:02:01.630
 waited, waited and bring of course finally 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.630
 replaced pro black 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:12.240
 collapsed temperatures got sick 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:13.500
 tolerate hair often marks in general shooting 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.730
 movie to new head 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.830
 indisposition and why was she more well here 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.500
 I canâ€™t say anything at all 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.040
 I hope they say that just bright 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.040
 becomes 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:36.099
 here I am and you have not arrived 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:43.799
 the day above can help were the goals 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:43.799
 when dubbed state is not taken into account 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:55.750

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.920
 same to this murder be attention that with 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.920
 different speeds 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.079
 of course
