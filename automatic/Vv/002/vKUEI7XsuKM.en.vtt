00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:54.570
 and then we all know that the heat 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:56.700
 in the hair they damage it too much 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.130
 then we were fin I wanted first 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.230
 that everything responds straight hair to 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.840
 to have it totally smooth I recorded a 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.790
 video is not done as much as some 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.850
 home remedies to keep the 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.490
 hair ready ready I use at all 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.590
 those remedies of milk and water is the 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.630
 what I do then he gave me in the 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.520
 I told him about his hair as he helped explain 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.530
 the video and then I pass the 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.070
 dryer and the iron is the only thing 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.229
 I do and now how do I do it for 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.090
 keep my hair like this to have a 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.920
 hair because we all know that from 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.690
 use both the iron and the dryer 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.170
 the truth I believe that they will not have 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:37.200
 hair but I still have a little but 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.880
 I have is because he used a mask 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.720
 a mask based on honey milk 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.800
 egg 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.020
 aloe then I will teach them to 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.260
 prepare this mask that is going to 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:56.160
 Nourish the hair to strengthen and avoid 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:58.080
 the fall and well I will repeat the 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.580
 ingredients that are needed to make 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.760
 for the mask 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.840
 first of all honey 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.840
 of bees 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.619
 let's take a little egg and take the 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.640
 bud 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:19.040
 in this case where are you taking me out 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:21.470
 milk and half a penny and aloe and the 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.040
 media pp aloe we are going to extract the 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.040
 crystal 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.920
 good the ingredients that he says he is going to 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.770
 Mix in the blender with the shampoo 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.230
 that we use regularly 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:40.900
 I use the rosemary and kim shampoo 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:43.310
 This shampoo nourishes moisturizes gives shine 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.410
 apart because it keeps the color that 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.050
 let's have on our hair and avoid 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.480
 fall is very good I recommend it 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.590
 from the professional motto then 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.590
 rosemary corner 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:01.140
 let's then mix all the 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.140
 ingredients start by milk 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:15.769
 in this case a glass of full milk 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.769
 in fact two eggs 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.100
 The yolk 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.920
 all right 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:35.090
 Honey 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.090
 two full spoonfuls 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.170
 two teaspoons of honey 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.770
 Y 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.480
 the glass 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:18.120
 of algae 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.840
 in this case I use media 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.840
 I knew 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.970
 I extracted the crystal 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:32.289
 we are going to mix it we will go back 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:46.190
 the number of treatments that 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:51.040
 let's prepare I'm going to add the shampoo in 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.040
 my case could add half work 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:12.270
 now let's pack it in this case I 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.909
 use a jar of shampoo 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.849
 empty then I recommend you 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:21.990
 do the same and good was our 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:25.199
 homemade mask remains with a very 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:27.960
 nice let's apply it in the 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:30.449
 hair for 40 minutes twice a 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.340
 the week we're going to keep it refrigerated 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:35.370
 and every time we apply it we're going to 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:37.289
 shake the vulva when we have it in the 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.960
 Let us massage hair with 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:43.050
 fingertip the amount that I 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:45.180
 prepare is for two people for 15 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.639
 days since I applied it to my mom 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.710
 It is advisable not to prepare the 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:52.820
 treatment for more than 15 days since 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.830
 the ingredients may be damaged 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:57.129
 and finally in the memories that are 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.830
 must have refrigerated 

00:05:57.129 --> 00:06:01.929
