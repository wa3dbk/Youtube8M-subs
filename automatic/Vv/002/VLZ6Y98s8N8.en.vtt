00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.790
 well I thought we're one more day and 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.790
 we are in minecraft 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.009
 do not 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.200
 on my way 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:14.200
 plus 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.310
 hello guys like I said we're already 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:25.430
 here in minecraft and we have the review of 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:27.380
 the adversity the snapshot 14 w 04 a 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.869
 has this new version the buttons 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.330
 to start is a big change that 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:36.830
 can put as we already knew in 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:39.260
 walls on the ceiling and the floor all like 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:42.379
 you see the reston are activated so 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.379
 work perfectly or we have the 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.860
 Ball of buttons with box of buttons 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.860
 there is one below 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.390
 1 above and to the sides can be put by 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.450
 all the dimensions as well 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.940
 we can say it everywhere 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.460
 what else scheme the next good thing 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.019
 this is a very nice book I have found 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.019
 in which this is a quarter block 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.070
 you see now but there is something because we give 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.780
 left click and jump something and 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.820
 disappears is a book completely of 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.420
 the frames with the new formula that have 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:23.600
 put and the new formula is this here 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:27.170
 we have the frame with a block of sane 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.420
 Dived a comparator and rest as you see 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.520
 the signal reaches here just 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:36.580
 shows a certain signal that if we click 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.580
 right already has two other three 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:49.789
 456 and now more we'll check it 6 7 8 and 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.990
 8 is the maximum that arrives arrives until the 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:55.409
 8 current which is normal 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:59.159
 basically for this it gives off the 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.440
 marquito with some power through 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.590
 a comparator 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.380
 important for the next the golems 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.900
 and the snow blows the goals of 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.910
 iron and the widder can be done now 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.740
 with dispensers 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.510
 as you see here we have it used 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.420
 the way already of the buttons to try 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.360
 that works as talkie visitors and 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.920
 we give him and block there is a pumpkin 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:28.760
 a pumpkin logically the same as here 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:32.420
 there is another that forms him 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.250
 the object the bug we can also 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.129
 do it with the we there are you can 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.629
 try it and do it but let's not what 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:42.650
 let's do that if we do not peta the 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:45.860
 world is worth the following is that of the 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.920
 golems and the pigs of hell the 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:52.849
 pig men now they were already 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:55.640
 since only rom items objects 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.609
 when you are killed in a way when you 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.700
 it kills you in a normal way 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:05.000
 let's not kill ourselves basically when 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.909
 die for a hundred things that are worth us 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.770
 that we have not done it before 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:12.640
 of hitting him 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.640
 well dies 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.280
 something else a diamond sword 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.650
 whenever you want, you die 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.010
 marching game what the golem endures 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.010
 of iron 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:38.460
 let's hold a bit more lava 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:41.740
 this is dead good 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:43.750
 he has died he has not given anything 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.390
 let's cover this 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:50.360
 but if we kill him with our 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:52.170
 hands then you release something 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.660
 good 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.090
 good 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.390
 it's me or they hold more when we pile 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.390
 now 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.080
 fair game has not sent me 595 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.910
 lingotazos 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.220
 and if he has not released anything before 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:13.550
 basically because now if you do not kill them 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:16.100
 you do not give absolutely anything 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.769
 next next thing so to speak 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.260
 let's catch some powder of bones 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.660
 supposed to have changed intelligence 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:28.370
 of certain villagers 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:31.670
 when we remove the wheat or carrots or 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:36.050
 potatoes in theory when they 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:40.120
 they detect they are going to replant but as you can see 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.120
 it does not work as well as they say 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.500
 that yes they have changed that now they follow you 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.920
 for some reason once in a while 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:52.400
 they start to follow and when you hit them 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:54.050
 they run away or you get network things like 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.320
 to be angry that I guess they are 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.320
 a bug 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:02.060
 I suppose we go see newgen or do nothing 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.710
 it's a guide bus for that new 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.650
 function that you have put on top 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.690
 works well be amazing the book of 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.450
 I frame the bushing that and we have another bomb 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.580
 what do you think it is and here are the 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:19.300
 Other lighting volksbus for everything 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:19.300
 The world 6 box lighting box 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:28.190
 and to finish you have two commands 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:30.650
 new for mapmakers that 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:33.470
 it's particle bar that is to see 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.910
 compare the particles of a certain area 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.070
 of the map did not understand very well 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.270
 operation but you will have it 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.940
 description in case you want to try it and 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:44.390
 the other is bar field is to fill with 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:47.210
 You will have one kind of object in both 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:49.100
 the description the notes of the snapshot 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:52.130
 so I hope you liked this 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:56.060
 mini review of which I like to do 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:06:00.340
 me from minecraft 14 w 04 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:00.340
