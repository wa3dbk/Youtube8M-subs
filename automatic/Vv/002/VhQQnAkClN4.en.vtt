some yeah I think I am I think we could

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.400 
some yeah I think I am I think we could
probably<00:02:06.310> say<00:02:07.030> if<00:02:07.629> you<00:02:07.899> look<00:02:08.080> at<00:02:08.229> this

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
probably say if you look at this

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.860 
probably say if you look at this
