00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:46.030 

just<00:03:39.530> look<00:03:39.769> at<00:03:39.890> that<00:03:42.459> that's<00:03:43.459> so<00:03:43.819> cool<00:03:45.040> my

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
just look at that that's so cool my

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.880 
just look at that that's so cool my
opinion<00:03:46.370> that<00:03:46.489> is<00:03:46.640> amazing<00:03:47.680> so<00:03:48.680> that's<00:03:48.829> the

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
opinion that is amazing so that's the

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.830 
opinion that is amazing so that's the
first<00:03:49.099> degree<00:03:49.459> burn<00:03:49.700> er<00:03:49.730> actually<00:03:50.000> and<00:03:50.480> it

first degree burn er actually and it

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.839 
first degree burn er actually and it
actually<00:03:50.989> gets<00:03:51.200> better<00:03:51.500> from<00:03:51.650> there<00:03:51.739> on<00:03:52.129> so<00:03:52.760> if

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
actually gets better from there on so if

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:54.220 
actually gets better from there on so if
we<00:03:52.939> take<00:03:52.969> the<00:03:53.180> first<00:03:53.390> degree<00:03:53.540> burn<00:03:53.870> or<00:03:54.049> place
