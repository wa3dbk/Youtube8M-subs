00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
the atmosphere and picking up on the

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
grout on the crowd and the one thing

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.110 
grout on the crowd and the one thing

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
I've noticed that we usually see from a

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.839 
I've noticed that we usually see from a
lease<00:02:19.300> is<00:02:19.599> that<00:02:20.260> she's<00:02:20.470> not<00:02:20.500> taking<00:02:21.010> a<00:02:21.550> lot<00:02:21.640> of

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
lease is that she's not taking a lot of

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:23.309 
lease is that she's not taking a lot of
