00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello band of people so that makes 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:11.130
 long ah yes of course you have all 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:12.929
 noticed that I have a move that 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.280
 involves a lot of little changes 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.480
 whether they are good or not 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.840
 example at the beginning of my move this 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.650
 who was funny is that I had not 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.900
 internet connection 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.310
 so obviously it happens to me very often 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.349
 to be in situations these kinds to 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.849
 north of angers mehers shops and 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.559
 news with the fine on sky that is 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:39.870
 no internet and on which if that's it 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:42.690
 is not wanted to quote without the bumps 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.770
 no no I refuse 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.620
 when you're alone you do stuff 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.660
 what do you stand in front of people there 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.040
 will take the good for a crazy by 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.500
 example I always dreamed of doing 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.630
 gypa but the most intimate I love and 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.370
 all the walk in my apartment the 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:01.530
 penis in the air the shoulder to the wind and for 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.530
 what hangs it moves 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.039
 the only thing that could maybe I 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:14.429
 say well maybe be super boring 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:16.859
 you go madam martin ap me like 

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:20.969

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:22.979
 doubt that I do not have curtains when 

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:25.109
 you're alone does not have the choice that you 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.420
 you shut up and the thing is that the 

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:27.959
 cook and me if I'm from a plate 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.459

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:30.929
 offbeat humor course to the goal of ensuring 

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:33.840
 peace you the best shit jokes 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:37.289
 with my ba sending ntm which 69 69 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.000
 ntm 69 69 89 cents more in 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:41.129
 more urgent but not without being when I 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.539
 cooking our belgium 44 years could 

00:01:41.129 --> 00:01:47.520
 do you limit happy me then I 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:49.289
 find it starts but I would have been 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.469
 no one if you had thought to cook them his 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:51.469
 paws 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:55.560
 good I admit I may be a little bit 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.170
 but to give you an idea the other 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.280
 day I made carbo pasta 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.959
 I really felt like 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.979
 participate in a show you know a 

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:03.979
 almost perfect dinner 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.370
 today we find ourselves building a 

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:11.670
 young Nantes student from 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.709
 vendee 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.989
 today baptist prepares us a 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.150
 dish of his is his specialty 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.950
 little aside on it I do not know you 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.659
 but I never understood why he 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:26.450
 did not give the couple directly months 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:29.970
 s capable of softness in the sky 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.980
 so here I am pretty perfect that this 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.370
 strange but what can this 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.480
 be 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:39.120
 I can imagine flat east yes yes 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:43.769
 that's the word new sk not us 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:46.079
 think of an escape is what you 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.840
 find it simpler frankly 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:50.609
 baptist explanations about this 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.919
 plan so what I call s able to 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:54.689
 old-fashioned sweetness is all 

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:59.669
 simply done it's pasta 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:03:00.000
 carbonara with bacon at a cost of 30 

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:01.530
 regions 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.090
 when you are alone all moved even 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.540
 underpants then two weeks and picks up a 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.220
 clean game 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.129
 there you have to behave like a 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.500
 true pole up what alone man yes it's 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.659
 which preferred to the device have 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:17.159
 not him the other ten months for laundry 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:18.870
 it's hot water or cold water and 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:20.310
 if not with its colors it happens 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.599
 how when you are alone 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.609
 it's up to you to go shopping 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:24.989
 yes because is not going to magic that goes them 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:28.440
 see but who will come out your closet 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.739
 who will tell you to fight his ties 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.209
 right here 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.739
 wael talent you say that because me 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.260
 when I go shopping and I leave 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.640
 to buy tomatoes apples from 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.930
 bananas of ham carrots 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.329
 chocapics of action arrows in 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.280
 bun cheese and stops its 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:45.950
 bars and oddly when I returned 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:52.519
 at home I changed the story I 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:53.989
 up with when you're alone it 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:54.939
 means cta the freedom to do everything 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:58.069
 what do you want when you want 

00:03:54.939 --> 00:04:00.170
 so for example while doing these 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:02.239
 no time rolled toilet paper 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.280
 you can you can you can jump on 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:05.840
 your bed you can you can you can 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.000
 to juggle with fruits you can you can 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.680
 you can pee it in the sink 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.079
 can you can you put your hand 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.430
 against the plate not by against 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:14.870
 it's stupid when you're alone 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.519
 another problem is that your 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.169
 person and who then appears to avoid 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.209
 as boredom sets in I developed to 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.349
 delhi the figure and do not let the 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.449
 sickness take over 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:25.740
 if that's the case contact us when he 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:27.000
 will in principle be water 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.620
 I know you can read from no 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.690
 feeling alone for example can betray 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.860
