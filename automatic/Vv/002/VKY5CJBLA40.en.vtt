 real estate using youtube 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.400
 we started 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.100
 many real estate agents 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.960
 roots and property owners have been 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.600
 realized the enormous success that can 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.910
 have when they effectively use the 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.610
 video as a sales tool for 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.650
 the properties that promote imagine 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.630
 the next scenario the family 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.930
 Hernandez is growing and decides what is 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.240
 time to look for new house 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.370
 The first thing they do is search in google 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:10.440
 who make my city sale 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:12.780
 the result of the search is your video 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.330
 Mr. Hernandez clicks on the video 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.330
 and he likes the house so he decides to see 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.430
 the outside first because I eat just 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.870
 You are starting the search process not 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.240
 wants to commit to making an appointment 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:27.120
 still when the hernandez family 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.640
 drive in front of your property see a 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.610
 sign that says scan this code 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.250
 to see videos of the interior so that 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.800
 Mrs. Hernandez takes her phone 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.820
 mobile and at that moment they start to see 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.560
 videos of the interior 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.800
 you will agree that the family 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:48.070
 Hernandez is ready to take a 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.030
 decision or make an appointment or you can continue 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.780
 looking for properties 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.970
 this whole process can be repeated 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.930
 hundreds of times without you having to 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.850
 to intervene 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.590
 Now that you have a better idea of 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.030
 huge impact that the video can have 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.790
 on the internet 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.060
 let's see the recommendations 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.929
 first create a video for each 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.480
 property available 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.180
 nowadays it is practically obligatory 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.760
 include images of the properties in 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.700
 all the marketing materials all 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.920
 the world does it but very few people 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.859
 is capitalizing on the enormous advantage of 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.560
 the video tours the video offers you 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:32.090
 a more detailed vision and enriches the 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.180
 visitor experience 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.849
 second recommendation includes shots of 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.420
 surrounding streets parks schools centers 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:44.300
 commercial near the property this 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.760
 It is a very effective way to show 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.040
 a potential buyer some of the 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.620
 local access points and attractions 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.370
 that make the neighborhood a place 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.799
 attractive to live 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.590
 third recommendation use 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:01.569
 narrations in your videos the same 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.569

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:12.430
 specific etcetera 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.349
 the narrated videos are more effective 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.480
 because they increase retention in the 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:18.340
 increase your credibility and memory 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.230
 interrupt the internal dialogue of 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.930

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.150
