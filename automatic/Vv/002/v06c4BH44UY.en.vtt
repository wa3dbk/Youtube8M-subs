00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.659
 me 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:12.190
 Without the course that work that Levi of just saying really I hear nothing downy do it is 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.490
 True even myself in many things 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:20.420
 I'm asking you, but after all that 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:24.100
 It's hard to say that it is a theater that can play Kabuki 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:27.800
 It sounds like that there is nothing 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:32.689
 If the lifeguard sounds good and comfortable 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:34.290
 Also we have as it is using the plus alpha we be of course a microphone to oa 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:39.190
 That microphone is 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:41.020
 I'm microphone from plus alpha why Mom voice or the microphone of the 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.480
 Don't have a microphone 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:50.809
 The image of a family that is a plus to live voice 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:54.570
 There is a role name of Mike and it may have been the end of the explosion even though the effect just went 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:56.820
 I do not put a little Kochuchi reverb 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.960
 car 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:04.040
 were no motor rutin is comfortable 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.880
 By putting that reverb a little 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.950
 After all everyone was very clear 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.290
 truly 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:15.250
 I can hear my heart being washed away 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:18.290
 But it is because is because a raw voice 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:23.890
 So the sound of the voice is the first 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:26.890
 It sounds good and the reverb is useless unless you go out first 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:33.890
 In terms of hardness 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:39.670
 Really I feel very high close to the audience from the stage I like my own 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:43.540
 I feel close to it despite the orchestra box 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:47.330
 So it's very easy to say, though they often say 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:50.080
 It's a very good girl, I guess it was retroactive to each other 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.080
 Because it is such 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.810
 Hakata is good 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.270
 I wonder if you have started 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.230
 After all, the bottom of a Broadway theater is pretty close, isn't it? 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.070
 This is ideal 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:08.319
 I think it's an environment 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:14.340
 In addition, it was decided to come to Hakata for miserables 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:18.000
 Various to meet expectations to everyone this time 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.670
 A member such as pleased entertainment to everyone in the improvement 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.500
 Tournament 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:26.330
 Also better in terms of a stage that you can see again and again 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.970
 I think it's done 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.860
 By all means 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.860
 I would like to have fun and see 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.469
 yeah yeah
