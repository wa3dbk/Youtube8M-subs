00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.079
 play fun tension christian you are 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.820
 the man behind all the actions here 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:30.310
 what is theirs? 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.990
 main task yes we are for the area 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.730
 We are responsible for games and sports 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.519
 the indiaca tournaments organize the 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.420
 Brennwald and her den 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:39.400
 orientation march and games without 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.300
 borders and always firefighters like 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.850
 many people are you 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.140
 arrived because which 4000 people 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.339
 To make a program I see that 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.500
 bit like a mammoth task 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:50.019
 we are only a small part of the 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.820
 great program is and we have 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:53.979
 relatively small partial area we have 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.199
 for every part of the program we 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:57.909
 organize two of them the whole 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.339
 document on the legs then vote 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:02.199
 In addition, we have someone else 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:05.170
 do a bit of backoffice and 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:08.229
 also the rental stations for balls and 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.600
 games organized our house and what 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:14.469
 do you say to humor so we know yes 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.700
 Every evening someone has something up there 

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:17.590
 bit against our last one is 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.530
 but a bit of rain every day as well as cookie 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.539
 always nice little white 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.780
 Clouds how do you see it here in general ? 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:27.130
 So the mood is the last eight 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.600
 somehow passed me by because 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.070
 We all were relatively done 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.749
 from the preparations for today 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.820
 day was the big one for us today 

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:36.399
 neighbor the first match garb and 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.469
 we went to bed in time 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:41.259
 from that we are very happy that it 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:42.850
 today we have not been raining though 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.619
 also be prepared for the rain and 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.390
 but I bring weatherproof clothes 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.350
 My guess the mood should only 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.130
 to hit the beat 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.929

 just in bed 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:07.090
 but you fought hard and at the end 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.649
