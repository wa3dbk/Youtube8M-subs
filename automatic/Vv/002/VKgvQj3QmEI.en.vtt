docks and whoops here like there's some
grass<00:03:32.940> so<00:03:33.390> you've<00:03:33.570> got<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.840> cobblestone<00:03:34.350> and

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
grass so you've got the cobblestone and

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.310

then the grass on the other side so

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.240 
then the grass on the other side so
pretty<00:03:37.320> neat<00:03:39.230> more<00:03:40.230> docks<00:03:40.440> more<00:03:40.739> grass<00:03:40.980> more

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
pretty neat more docks more grass more

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:48.780 
pretty neat more docks more grass more
buildings

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.190 

here<00:03:49.790> we've<00:03:49.940> actually<00:03:50.120> got<00:03:50.480> some<00:03:50.510> different

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
here we've actually got some different

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.080 
here we've actually got some different
looking<00:03:51.440> road<00:03:51.830> and<00:03:52.250> now<00:03:52.400> if<00:03:52.670> I'm<00:03:52.850> not<00:03:52.880> mistaken

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
looking road and now if I'm not mistaken

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.720 
looking road and now if I'm not mistaken
I<00:03:53.900> think<00:03:54.140> this<00:03:54.350> is<00:03:54.500> actually<00:03:54.710> the<00:03:55.160> same<00:03:55.400> sort

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
I think this is actually the same sort

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.450 
I think this is actually the same sort
of<00:03:55.820> texture<00:03:56.420> from<00:03:57.050> the<00:03:57.290> dungeon<00:03:57.500> tile<00:03:57.890> set<00:03:58.250> so

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:58.460 
of texture from the dungeon tile set so

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:59.950 
of texture from the dungeon tile set so
you<00:03:58.520> could<00:03:58.730> probably<00:03:58.880> combine<00:03:59.480> them<00:03:59.690> pretty

00:03:59.950 --> 00:03:59.960 
you could probably combine them pretty

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.330 
you could probably combine them pretty
seamlessly<00:04:00.500> oh<00:04:02.620> that's<00:04:03.620> cool

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
seamlessly oh that's cool

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.670 
seamlessly oh that's cool
that's<00:04:05.330> really<00:04:05.660> neat<00:04:05.840> that<00:04:05.990> bridge<00:04:06.260> thing<00:04:06.530> I

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
that's really neat that bridge thing I

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.020 
that's really neat that bridge thing I
can<00:04:06.830> imagine<00:04:06.980> the<00:04:07.250> encounter<00:04:07.580> taking<00:04:07.850> place

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
can imagine the encounter taking place

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.750 
can imagine the encounter taking place
on<00:04:08.180> the<00:04:08.240> bridge<00:04:08.450> I<00:04:11.650> think<00:04:12.650> you've<00:04:12.770> got<00:04:12.980> um<00:04:13.280> some

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
on the bridge I think you've got um some

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.380 
on the bridge I think you've got um some
a<00:04:14.570> table<00:04:15.200> very<00:04:15.710> cool<00:04:16.160> I<00:04:16.430> I<00:04:16.489> was<00:04:17.000> hoping<00:04:17.269> they

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
a table very cool I I was hoping they

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.789 
a table very cool I I was hoping they
would<00:04:17.540> include<00:04:17.750> something<00:04:18.049> like<00:04:18.140> that<00:04:18.380> table

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
would include something like that table

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.300 
would include something like that table
stairs<00:04:19.489> ladder<00:04:20.260> some<00:04:21.260> a<00:04:21.470> bridge<00:04:21.920> for<00:04:22.220> the

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
stairs ladder some a bridge for the

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.090 
stairs ladder some a bridge for the
sewer<00:04:22.600> and<00:04:23.600> then<00:04:23.720> the<00:04:23.840> other<00:04:24.110> side<00:04:24.320> oh<00:04:24.560> this<00:04:24.950> is

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
sewer and then the other side oh this is

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.570 
sewer and then the other side oh this is
perfect<00:04:25.550> all<00:04:26.180> right<00:04:26.240> so<00:04:27.100> you've<00:04:28.100> got<00:04:28.280> a<00:04:28.310> lot<00:04:28.550> of

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
perfect all right so you've got a lot of

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.890 
perfect all right so you've got a lot of
tables<00:04:29.270> chairs<00:04:30.820> fireplace<00:04:31.820> things<00:04:32.600> that<00:04:32.810> you

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
tables chairs fireplace things that you

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.660 
tables chairs fireplace things that you
can<00:04:33.110> put<00:04:33.350> inside<00:04:33.500> the<00:04:33.950> buildings<00:04:34.310> that<00:04:34.430> come

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:34.670 
can put inside the buildings that come

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.310 
can put inside the buildings that come
with<00:04:34.820> this<00:04:34.970> set<00:04:35.210> that's<00:04:35.750> what<00:04:35.900> I<00:04:35.960> was<00:04:36.110> really

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
with this set that's what I was really

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.830 
with this set that's what I was really
hoping<00:04:36.710> I<00:04:36.950> would<00:04:37.730> be<00:04:37.760> included<00:04:38.300> here<00:04:38.540> would<00:04:38.720> be

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
hoping I would be included here would be

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.310 
hoping I would be included here would be
just<00:04:39.110> some<00:04:39.560> very<00:04:39.770> blank<00:04:40.660> versatile<00:04:41.660> building

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
just some very blank versatile building

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.580 
just some very blank versatile building
pieces<00:04:42.920> that<00:04:43.160> then<00:04:43.370> I<00:04:43.400> could<00:04:43.790> put<00:04:44.090> a<00:04:44.360> fill<00:04:45.290> with

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
pieces that then I could put a fill with

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.400 
pieces that then I could put a fill with
my<00:04:45.860> own<00:04:46.150> little<00:04:47.150> bit<00:04:47.510> so<00:04:47.750> I<00:04:47.780> can<00:04:48.020> design<00:04:48.140> the

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
my own little bit so I can design the

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.700 
my own little bit so I can design the
building<00:04:48.710> myself<00:04:49.130> essentially<00:04:50.380> this<00:04:51.380> city

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
building myself essentially this city

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.070 
building myself essentially this city
set<00:04:52.010> is<00:04:52.220> really<00:04:52.580> the<00:04:53.180> best<00:04:53.330> of<00:04:53.540> both<00:04:53.690> worlds

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
set is really the best of both worlds

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.400 
set is really the best of both worlds

you get a dungeon tile set and they're
too<00:05:08.270> specific<00:05:09.169> to<00:05:09.200> use<00:05:09.680> for<00:05:10.040> a<00:05:10.070> lot<00:05:10.190> of

too specific to use for a lot of

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.270 
too specific to use for a lot of
situations<00:05:10.550> a<00:05:11.240> good<00:05:11.630> example<00:05:12.140> would<00:05:13.040> be<00:05:13.100> the

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
situations a good example would be the

dark sets which I think are a little bit
