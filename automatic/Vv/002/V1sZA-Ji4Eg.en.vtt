00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:03.300
 there is everyone I hope you 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.609
 be well 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.529
 today we find ourselves together for 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.090
 a glitch video about people 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.040
 wishing to obtain a Player 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.469
 free in career mode in 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.790
 as a manager for that it takes 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.830
 train a team have enough 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.900
 money to buy the player I 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.640
 for my part chose the psg because 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.020
 this team has no less than 120 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.300
 millions of euros on fifa 15 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.470
 I decide aboard to buy the world 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.599
 which unfortunately I'm going very fast 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.309
 the account and remember so 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.500
 that he had recently joined the Bayer 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:39.500
 munich so that makes the transaction 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.500
 impossible I change players 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:47.980
 indeed I will turn to this very 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:52.050
 talented marc grrrr I formulate a 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.050
 70 million euros offer 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:01.180
 I submit hour swan 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.020
 properly 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.020
 I go back to the menu 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.280
 and I advance the time 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.850
 to my surprise I notice 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.320
 how loan was denied this pretense 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.480
 which proved too low for a player 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.980
 also powerful I increase this price 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.420
 and even exceeds the demand for dortmund 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.560
 offering 100 million euros offer 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.560
 that dortmund is obliged to accept 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.909
 I advance the time 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.909
 still an effort 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.250
 I receive countless requests 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.000
 two transfers 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:48.540
 dedicated to edinson cavani 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.540
 whatever 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.560
 I notice that my offer has been accepted 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.630
 and that's where 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.430
 I like that the phenomenal for the 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.659
 need the video it's at the level of the 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.549
 post that everything changes 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.710
 I decide to assign him as posts 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.479
 incumbents in the making we look at what 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.979
 marco reus not answer even if I think 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.979
 that you already have idea of ​​his reaction 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:15.150
 good i'm going to decide to delete all 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.620
 these mails because it confuses me that 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.610
 takes a place far too big 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.860
 for me 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.300
 hop I notice that the proposal of 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.920
 contract is denied I think you 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.660
 had already predicted yves the post I 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.530
 assign it to him now let's go back to 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.940
 menu is then on my priority list 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.830
 we notice the presence of marco reus 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.110
 now we will redo a price 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.190
 for our dear mill gorus with a price 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.510
 one of the dressings not exceeding the 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.930
 0/1 returns on the mails and in 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.930
 recycling 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.580
 we now put 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.740
 a normal salary a decent salary and 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.550
 a suitable position for me I put 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.550
 indisputable holder 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.920

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.920

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:20.200
 we managed to get marcos 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.420

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.590
