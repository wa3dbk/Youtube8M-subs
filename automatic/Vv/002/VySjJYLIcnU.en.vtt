one<00:01:45.759> method<00:01:45.969> is<00:01:46.329> to<00:01:46.689> use<00:01:46.990> a<00:01:47.950> statistic

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.410 

another<00:01:55.410> method<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.160> begin<00:01:56.940> with<00:01:57.270> a
