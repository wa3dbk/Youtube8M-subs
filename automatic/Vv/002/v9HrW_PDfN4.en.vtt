them<00:01:29.680> in<00:01:29.800> the<00:01:29.890> rope<00:01:30.220> I<00:01:30.340> was<00:01:30.490> actually<00:01:30.670> a<00:01:30.850> little

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
them in the rope I was actually a little

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
now it's over to the force tester to

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:31.010 
now it's over to the force tester to
break<00:04:20.350> the<00:04:20.500> tip<00:04:20.680> of<00:04:20.829> the<00:04:20.919> blade

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.960 

and<00:04:32.160> now<00:04:33.160> we're<00:04:33.310> going<00:04:33.400> to<00:04:33.490> go<00:04:33.610> ahead<00:04:33.759> and

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
and now we're going to go ahead and

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.480 
and now we're going to go ahead and

break the lock on the knife 5:30 is

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.430

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.410 

here's<00:04:52.700> something<00:04:52.940> I<00:04:52.970> don't<00:04:53.120> think<00:04:53.300> we've

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
here's something I don't think we've

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.670 
here's something I don't think we've
shown<00:04:53.720> before<00:04:53.750> we're<00:04:54.170> going<00:04:54.260> to<00:04:54.320> go<00:04:54.440> ahead<00:04:54.560> and

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
shown before we're going to go ahead and

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.890 
shown before we're going to go ahead and
take<00:04:54.860> apart<00:04:55.250> the<00:04:55.400> knife<00:04:55.580> now<00:04:55.850> and<00:04:56.150> see<00:04:56.720> what

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
take apart the knife now and see what

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.590 
take apart the knife now and see what
went<00:04:57.050> wrong<00:04:57.580> once<00:04:58.580> again<00:04:58.700> the<00:04:58.880> 530<00:04:59.330> is<00:04:59.450> not

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
went wrong once again the 530 is not

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.720 
went wrong once again the 530 is not
designed<00:05:00.080> as<00:05:00.260> a<00:05:00.320> super<00:05:00.710> hard<00:05:00.950> you<00:05:01.040> snipe<00:05:01.460> it's

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:01.730 
designed as a super hard you snipe it's

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.280 
designed as a super hard you snipe it's
more<00:05:01.850> of<00:05:01.940> a<00:05:02.030> folding<00:05:02.480> razor<00:05:02.750> but<00:05:03.050> let's<00:05:03.200> go

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290 
more of a folding razor but let's go

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:11.260 
more of a folding razor but let's go
ahead<00:05:03.320> and<00:05:03.590> see<00:05:03.740> what<00:05:03.890> happened

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.909 

okay<00:05:11.960> so<00:05:12.020> as<00:05:12.259> you<00:05:12.319> can<00:05:12.560> see<00:05:12.710> there's

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
okay so as you can see there's

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:15.040 
okay so as you can see there's
deformation<00:05:13.550> in<00:05:13.669> the<00:05:13.759> liners<00:05:14.180> and<00:05:14.449> fracturing

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
deformation in the liners and fracturing

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:25.070 
deformation in the liners and fracturing
right<00:05:15.560> above<00:05:15.830> the<00:05:16.009> axis<00:05:16.460> bar

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.200 

although<00:05:25.800> the<00:05:25.919> knife<00:05:26.099> is<00:05:26.370> broken<00:05:26.729> the<00:05:27.030> lock

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
although the knife is broken the lock

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.230 
although the knife is broken the lock
does<00:05:27.539> technically<00:05:28.020> still<00:05:28.319> function<00:05:29.240> but

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
does technically still function but

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.640 
does technically still function but
given<00:05:30.629> the<00:05:30.720> state<00:05:30.780> of<00:05:31.080> it<00:05:31.169> I<00:05:31.229> don't<00:05:31.379> think<00:05:31.439> I'd

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
given the state of it I don't think I'd

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.640 
given the state of it I don't think I'd
be<00:05:31.770> using<00:05:32.099> this<00:05:32.189> particular<00:05:32.400> knife<00:05:32.849> again

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
be using this particular knife again

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.959 
be using this particular knife again
nice<00:05:34.650> thing<00:05:34.860> is<00:05:34.979> if<00:05:35.129> you<00:05:35.219> get<00:05:35.340> a<00:05:35.400> failure<00:05:35.819> like

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:35.969 
nice thing is if you get a failure like

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:37.429 
nice thing is if you get a failure like
