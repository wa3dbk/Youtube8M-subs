 only when the angry front door is closed 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.700
 might be due to the content exercise space 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.870
 that means that linux-welt in the door now in principle before the

 and basically dragging them around with us and for more often through the doors 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.689
 Percent lost so much confidence to comment that was also from the 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:51.440

 Heikkinen Moments Seriously, then, somewhere, there has to be that way 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.990
 a bit tighter is different after different places 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.990

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.140
 I react 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.930

 and it works 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:29.420
 I guess so 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.420

 Tim Burke succeeds in leaving the first hurdle 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:48.480
 This empty barn is a second test without a twitch by the 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.319
 big door 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.319
 although it is important to them 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:55.629
 without problems 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:58.629
 through the narrow door

 ever tried underground doors goes several times 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.189
 several times as a success 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:18.279

 familiar 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:30.189

 Ratzeburg's biggest grief 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.189
 The path did not really lead to that 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:48.309
 that offers as the consume 

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:51.549

 while everything is in cash 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.759
 everything is super that was crucial 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:27.430
 the markets for all who will happen in the future 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.729
 if you do something like that 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:32.610
 we want very small steps and we want grants in Melbourne 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.139

 Bocholt continues to work or walk so wonderfully 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:51.669
 with a change of ownership of the bistro before and now where we have ourselves 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:54.669
 think about what really happened 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:59.009
 unfortunately they do what they want or 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:00.400
 SN APA 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.910
 Problem solved in seven days without compulsion and without violence 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.660
