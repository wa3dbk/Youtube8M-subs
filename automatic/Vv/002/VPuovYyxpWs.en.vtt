00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:10.139
 downs the point is hello youtube friends 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.780
 Welcome to our channel dollars or 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.719
 point is today we want to show you how 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.220
 set up our iphone with ios 7 for 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.200
 can enable or disable the 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.480
 notifications of any of the 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.150
 applications that we have installed in 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.550
 our iphone as it is many already know 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.640
 notifications are small notices or 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.900
 alerts about the activity 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.710
 happened in certain applications 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.840
 installed on our device 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.610
 these can be very useful in 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.250
 applications such as email 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.739
 to be instantly aware of 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.960
 possible important issues but that 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.670
 however in other applications like 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.670
 games can end up being quite 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.829
 annoying as well the first thing that 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.540
 we must do to deactivate or 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.640
 activate notifications will be 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:59.089
 unlock our iphone and direct us 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.210
 to adjustments once inside we will find 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:04.269
 easily the option that says center of 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.799
 notifications 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.630
 once inside the center 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:10.689
 notifications will show us a series 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.490
 of configurations however we 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:15.250
 we will go to the list of applications 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.500
 that will appear below in this list 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.329
 we select the application which 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.600
 we want to turn off notifications 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:24.819
 once inside we will find a first 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.670
 graphical configuration in which yes 

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:30.520
 we want to deactivate we will have to click on 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.740
 nothing else there is another configuration 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.719
 as strips so that notifications 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.649
 They appear in the top panel 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:37.810
 of the screen 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:40.270
 the third configuration would be alerts 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.280
 in this last type of notification the 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.670
 user must interact with it 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.739
 marking the as seen further below 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.200
 we will find configuration options 

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:52.899
 as for example the deactivation of 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.549
 sound deactivating the number of 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:57.489
 notifications within a circle 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:59.679
 next to the application as well as your view 

00:01:57.489 --> 00:02:01.450
 in the notification center or the 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:03.730
 enabling or disabling the 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.040
 view on the locked screen 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.320
 in our case if we do not want to receive 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.540
 no type of notification by 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.090
 the application we recommend to disable 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.120
 the all 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.519
 finally we went in the configuration 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.709
 pressing back and even can 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:22.250
 close adjustments through multitasking 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.060
 and our iphone will be totally 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.180
 configured not to receive 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.549
 good application notifications 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.709
 friends as you have seen is very simple 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.930
 to configure, however, the majority of 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.700
 the apps will ask if we accept the 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.860
 notifications by said 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.900
 application at the moment in which 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.360
 we access it for the first time after its 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.849
 installation however that is accepted 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.530
 decline is the configuration this is the 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:49.110
 way to change it when we 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.819
 we want and nothing else that's all for 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.440
