00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
running round was close to impossible

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.540 
running round was close to impossible
after<00:01:29.410> while<00:01:29.590> I<00:01:29.620> found<00:01:29.980> a<00:01:30.070> place<00:01:30.280> where<00:01:30.310> they

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
after while I found a place where they

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.670 
after while I found a place where they
seem<00:01:30.760> to<00:01:30.790> be<00:01:30.910> relaxed<00:01:31.420> enough<00:01:31.660> to<00:01:31.840> film<00:01:32.110> so<00:01:32.590> you

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
seem to be relaxed enough to film so you

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.900 
seem to be relaxed enough to film so you
can<00:01:32.800> see<00:01:32.980> why<00:01:33.130> they<00:01:33.310> are<00:01:33.400> called<00:01:33.430> the<00:01:33.760> red

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.910 
can see why they are called the red

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.700 
can see why they are called the red
squirrel<00:01:34.210> but<00:01:34.660> that<00:01:34.810> red<00:01:35.020> coat<00:01:35.170> can<00:01:35.410> actually

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
squirrel but that red coat can actually

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.440 
squirrel but that red coat can actually
change<00:01:35.890> become<00:01:36.370> more<00:01:36.610> grey<00:01:36.850> when<00:01:37.180> it<00:01:37.300> gets

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
change become more grey when it gets

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.570 
change become more grey when it gets
into<00:01:37.630> winter<00:01:37.960> that<00:01:38.800> helps<00:01:39.250> it<00:01:39.400> stay

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
into winter that helps it stay

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.280
