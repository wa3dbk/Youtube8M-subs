that's<00:02:41.040> we're<00:02:41.370> going<00:02:41.580> with<00:02:41.670> that

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
that's we're going with that

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.310 
that's we're going with that
why<00:02:42.330> not<00:02:42.570> so<00:02:43.290> this<00:02:43.680> one<00:02:43.920> was<00:02:44.340> tougher<00:02:45.000> but<00:02:45.330> not

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
why not so this one was tougher but not

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.380 
why not so this one was tougher but not
for<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.680> reasons<00:02:47.040> you<00:02:47.160> would<00:02:47.280> think<00:02:47.520> this<00:02:48.209> was

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
for the reasons you would think this was

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.240

tougher<00:02:48.780> because<00:02:49.080> he<00:02:49.200> just<00:02:49.380> constantly<00:02:49.620> turns

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
tougher because he just constantly turns

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.850

another suggestion that Alan and my
friend<00:03:44.910> the<00:03:45.090> sloth<00:03:45.330> John<00:03:45.690> they<00:03:46.620> had<00:03:46.769> come<00:03:46.980> up

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
friend the sloth John they had come up

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.039 
friend the sloth John they had come up
with<00:03:47.160> was<00:03:47.760> that<00:03:47.910> it's<00:03:48.030> possible<00:03:48.510> that<00:03:48.720> this<00:03:48.840> is

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
with was that it's possible that this is

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.289 
with was that it's possible that this is
like<00:03:49.230> a<00:03:49.260> like<00:03:49.950> a<00:03:49.980> barkat<00:03:50.430> evolution<00:03:50.970> style

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
like a like a barkat evolution style

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.620 
like a like a barkat evolution style
thing<00:03:51.600> where<00:03:52.350> if<00:03:52.709> you<00:03:52.890> can<00:03:53.070> find<00:03:53.630> something

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
thing where if you can find something

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.410 
thing where if you can find something
that<00:03:54.959> you<00:03:55.110> can<00:03:55.140> evolve<00:03:55.620> a<00:03:56.239> Cragin<00:03:57.239> that<00:03:57.360> you

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
that you can evolve a Cragin that you

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.449 
that you can evolve a Cragin that you
can<00:03:57.540> evolve<00:03:57.810> perhaps<00:03:58.650> this<00:03:58.980> is<00:03:59.130> like<00:03:59.310> the

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
can evolve perhaps this is like the

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.820 
can evolve perhaps this is like the
Verma<00:03:59.760> vers<00:03:59.910> version<00:04:00.450> of<00:04:00.660> that<00:04:00.810> Cragin<00:04:01.350> which

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
Verma vers version of that Cragin which

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.289 
Verma vers version of that Cragin which
that's<00:04:02.010> a<00:04:02.160> pretty<00:04:02.310> interesting<00:04:02.760> idea<00:04:02.880> there

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
that's a pretty interesting idea there
