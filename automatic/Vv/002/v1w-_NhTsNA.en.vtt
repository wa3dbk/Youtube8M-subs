hello<00:00:05.439> RFID<00:00:06.439> based<00:00:06.800> car<00:00:07.609> parking<00:00:08.290> here<00:00:09.290> we

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:09.470 
hello RFID based car parking here we

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.980 
hello RFID based car parking here we
have<00:00:09.740> a<00:00:09.950> microcontroller<00:00:10.460> an<00:00:11.389> LCD<00:00:11.900> display

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:11.990 
have a microcontroller an LCD display

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.369 
have a microcontroller an LCD display
for<00:00:12.580> getting<00:00:13.580> the<00:00:13.730> information<00:00:13.999> to<00:00:14.480> motors

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:15.379 
for getting the information to motors

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:17.920 
for getting the information to motors
for<00:00:15.620> entry<00:00:16.100> and<00:00:16.129> exit<00:00:16.580> and<00:00:17.090> these<00:00:17.690> are<00:00:17.810> the

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
whole system works and there we have for

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.270 
whole system works and there we have for
a<00:01:50.990> demonstration<00:01:51.320> purposes<00:01:51.979> we<00:01:52.250> have

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
a demonstration purposes we have

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.940 
a demonstration purposes we have
