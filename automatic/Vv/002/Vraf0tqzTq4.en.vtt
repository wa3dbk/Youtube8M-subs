00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:14.080 
myself Rob Allen today I'm going to talk
to<00:00:11.930> you<00:00:12.049> about<00:00:12.170> bands<00:00:13.010> there's<00:00:13.670> a<00:00:13.760> big<00:00:13.910> variety

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:14.090 
to you about bands there's a big variety

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.660 
to you about bands there's a big variety
of<00:00:14.420> band<00:00:15.170> manufacturers<00:00:15.769> in<00:00:16.099> the<00:00:16.189> world<00:00:16.219> and

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670 
of band manufacturers in the world and

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.280 
of band manufacturers in the world and
they've<00:00:17.240> all<00:00:17.360> got<00:00:17.390> different<00:00:17.869> ways<00:00:17.990> of

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:18.290 
they've all got different ways of

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.970 
they've all got different ways of
producing<00:00:18.800> bands<00:00:19.400> the<00:00:20.180> best<00:00:21.170> is<00:00:21.410> a<00:00:21.470> dipped

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
producing bands the best is a dipped

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.599 
producing bands the best is a dipped
process<00:00:22.630> dipped<00:00:23.630> and<00:00:23.840> or<00:00:24.710> extruded<00:00:25.340> are<00:00:25.460> the

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:25.609 
process dipped and or extruded are the

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.019 
process dipped and or extruded are the
two<00:00:25.789> main<00:00:26.080> styles<00:00:27.400> extruded<00:00:28.400> being<00:00:28.609> a<00:00:28.670> cheaper

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
two main styles extruded being a cheaper

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.670 
two main styles extruded being a cheaper
way<00:00:29.180> to<00:00:29.210> produce<00:00:29.539> but<00:00:29.900> definitely<00:00:30.320> doesn't

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:30.680 
way to produce but definitely doesn't

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.409 
way to produce but definitely doesn't
give<00:00:30.830> you<00:00:30.920> the<00:00:31.070> same<00:00:31.310> toughness<00:00:32.269> or

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
give you the same toughness or

elasticity the dip process is similar to
making<00:00:36.320> candles<00:00:36.949> it<00:00:37.190> goes<00:00:37.370> through<00:00:37.640> a

builds up the thickness if you look at
the<00:00:46.070> band<00:00:46.309> once<00:00:46.610> it's<00:00:46.820> being<00:00:47.030> cut<00:00:47.449> you<00:00:48.140> can<00:00:48.409> see

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:48.769 
the band once it's being cut you can see

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:51.850 
the band once it's being cut you can see
rings<00:00:49.640> similar<00:00:50.089> to<00:00:50.239> tree<00:00:50.510> rings<00:00:50.780> that<00:00:51.530> proves

rings similar to tree rings that proves

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.160

dipping process we use a blue band this

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:00.369 
dipping process we use a blue band this
was<00:00:58.970> something<00:00:59.180> we<00:00:59.390> introduced<00:00:59.750> a<00:00:59.930> while<00:01:00.140> back

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
was something we introduced a while back

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.890 
was something we introduced a while back
to<00:01:00.589> compare<00:01:01.280> the<00:01:01.460> difference<00:01:01.850> between<00:01:01.909> other

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:02.900 
to compare the difference between other

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.219 
to compare the difference between other
brands<00:01:03.559> and<00:01:03.729> to<00:01:04.729> show<00:01:05.119> that<00:01:05.150> we<00:01:05.510> were<00:01:05.540> using<00:01:05.900> a

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
brands and to show that we were using a

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.620 
brands and to show that we were using a
higher<00:01:06.439> quality<00:01:06.979> band<00:01:07.430> many<00:01:08.119> of<00:01:08.240> these<00:01:08.360> days

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
higher quality band many of these days

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.930 
higher quality band many of these days
they<00:01:08.869> have<00:01:08.900> copied<00:01:09.350> the<00:01:09.470> color<00:01:09.680> to<00:01:10.520> try<00:01:10.760> and

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
they have copied the color to try and

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.070 
they have copied the color to try and
follow<00:01:11.270> our<00:01:11.660> trend<00:01:12.050> the<00:01:12.860> best<00:01:13.190> band<00:01:14.080> material

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
follow our trend the best band material

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.740 
follow our trend the best band material
is<00:01:15.290> the<00:01:15.980> natural<00:01:16.730> latex<00:01:16.910> in<00:01:17.210> its<00:01:17.360> truest<00:01:17.690> form

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
is the natural latex in its truest form

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.420 
is the natural latex in its truest form
if<00:01:18.470> you<00:01:18.530> look<00:01:18.770> at<00:01:18.890> the<00:01:18.980> middle<00:01:19.190> of<00:01:19.310> these

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
if you look at the middle of these

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.530 
if you look at the middle of these
they're<00:01:19.760> amber<00:01:20.270> that's<00:01:21.110> the<00:01:21.380> best<00:01:21.620> possible

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
they're amber that's the best possible

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.920 
they're amber that's the best possible
elasticity<00:01:23.540> and<00:01:25.120> durability<00:01:26.120> the<00:01:26.510> problem

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
elasticity and durability the problem

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.230 
elasticity and durability the problem
with<00:01:27.050> it<00:01:27.200> though<00:01:27.380> UV<00:01:27.950> is<00:01:28.190> bad<00:01:28.700> for<00:01:29.000> it

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
with it though UV is bad for it

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.210 
with it though UV is bad for it
so<00:01:29.600> the<00:01:29.750> arctic<00:01:30.110> color<00:01:30.320> is<00:01:30.590> more<00:01:30.830> UV

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
so the arctic color is more UV

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.850 
so the arctic color is more UV
protectant<00:01:31.790> than<00:01:32.360> anything<00:01:32.720> else<00:01:32.900> you<00:01:33.530> cannot

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
protectant than anything else you cannot

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.120 
protectant than anything else you cannot
get<00:01:34.160> a<00:01:34.400> colored<00:01:35.030> band<00:01:35.270> with<00:01:35.570> a<00:01:35.710> opaque<00:01:36.710> middle

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
get a colored band with a opaque middle

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.450 
get a colored band with a opaque middle
and<00:01:37.480> a<00:01:38.480> color<00:01:38.840> on<00:01:39.020> the<00:01:39.110> outside<00:01:39.530> if<00:01:39.800> it's<00:01:40.310> been

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
and a color on the outside if it's been

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.850 
and a color on the outside if it's been
extruded<00:01:40.909> so<00:01:41.420> it's<00:01:41.570> one<00:01:41.720> way<00:01:41.870> to<00:01:41.930> tell<00:01:42.260> quality

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
extruded so it's one way to tell quality

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.270 
extruded so it's one way to tell quality
we<00:01:43.820> have<00:01:43.850> four<00:01:44.630> different<00:01:45.020> diameters<00:01:45.560> we<00:01:46.130> use

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
we have four different diameters we use

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.740 
we have four different diameters we use
a<00:01:46.310> 14<00:01:46.820> millimeter<00:01:47.290> 16<00:01:48.290> millimeter<00:01:48.880> 18<00:01:49.880> and<00:01:50.150> a

20<00:01:51.170> millimeter<00:01:51.409> the<00:01:52.280> size<00:01:52.520> would<00:01:52.760> depend<00:01:53.060> on

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
20 millimeter the size would depend on

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.140 
20 millimeter the size would depend on
how<00:01:53.450> you<00:01:53.510> would<00:01:53.720> set<00:01:53.960> up<00:01:53.990> your<00:01:54.190> gun<00:01:55.190> and<00:01:55.430> what

how you would set up your gun and what
