preview<00:02:20.850> size<00:02:21.180> in<00:02:21.630> my<00:02:22.470> opinion<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.670> preview

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
preview size in my opinion the preview

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.510 
preview size in my opinion the preview
size<00:02:24.330> shouldn't<00:02:25.140> be<00:02:25.230> any<00:02:25.470> bigger<00:02:25.860> than<00:02:26.370> the

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
size shouldn't be any bigger than the

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.610 
size shouldn't be any bigger than the

resolution of your monitor that doesn't
make<00:02:28.950> sense<00:02:29.580> I<00:02:29.910> use<00:02:30.510> of<00:02:30.660> 1440<00:02:31.560> so<00:02:31.800> I'll<00:02:31.920> go

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
make sense I use of 1440 so I'll go

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.670 
make sense I use of 1440 so I'll go
ahead<00:02:32.100> and<00:02:32.400> change<00:02:32.610> that<00:02:32.990> preview<00:02:33.990> quality<00:02:34.230> I

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
ahead and change that preview quality I

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.730 
ahead and change that preview quality I
like<00:02:35.100> leaving<00:02:35.550> that<00:02:35.700> at<00:02:35.910> medium<00:02:36.720> again<00:02:37.440> it's<00:02:37.620> a

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
like leaving that at medium again it's a

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.350 
like leaving that at medium again it's a
preview<00:02:38.190> it<00:02:38.400> has<00:02:38.520> nothing<00:02:38.910> to<00:02:38.940> do<00:02:39.240> with

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
preview it has nothing to do with

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.210 
preview it has nothing to do with
anything<00:02:39.810> except<00:02:40.410> what<00:02:40.560> you<00:02:40.680> see<00:02:40.950> on<00:02:41.130> the

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
anything except what you see on the

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.000 
anything except what you see on the
screen<00:02:41.340> preview<00:02:42.210> is<00:02:42.510> fine<00:02:42.780> and<00:02:43.050> you<00:02:43.709> want<00:02:43.890> to

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
screen preview is fine and you want to

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.640 
screen preview is fine and you want to
discard<00:02:44.490> your<00:02:44.820> previews<00:02:45.330> after<00:02:45.840> so<00:02:46.110> much<00:02:46.320> time

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
discard your previews after so much time

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.500 
discard your previews after so much time
and<00:02:46.920> what<00:02:47.400> that<00:02:47.550> means<00:02:47.730> is<00:02:48.030> it's<00:02:48.209> going<00:02:48.420> to

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
and what that means is it's going to

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.180 
and what that means is it's going to
build<00:02:48.660> these<00:02:48.900> one-on-one<00:02:49.440> previews<00:02:49.920> as<00:02:50.070> you

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
build these one-on-one previews as you

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.430 
build these one-on-one previews as you
work<00:02:50.400> and<00:02:50.640> some<00:02:51.450> people<00:02:51.750> like<00:02:51.870> to<00:02:52.050> get<00:02:52.170> rid<00:02:52.410> of

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
work and some people like to get rid of

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.040 
work and some people like to get rid of
those<00:02:52.709> after<00:02:53.220> so<00:02:53.400> often<00:02:53.850> I<00:02:54.060> usually<00:02:54.540> don't<00:02:54.780> so

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
those after so often I usually don't so

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.470 
those after so often I usually don't so
I<00:02:55.080> changed<00:02:55.530> that<00:02:55.680> to<00:02:55.830> never<00:02:56.070> down<00:02:56.970> here<00:02:57.300> we

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
I changed that to never down here we

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.170 
I changed that to never down here we
have<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:57.870> number<00:02:58.290> system<00:02:58.830> it's<00:02:59.280> going<00:02:59.670> to<00:02:59.850> use

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
have the number system it's going to use

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.220 
have the number system it's going to use
when<00:03:00.810> it<00:03:00.930> begins<00:03:01.170> numbering<00:03:01.830> imported<00:03:02.670> images

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
when it begins numbering imported images

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.560 
when it begins numbering imported images
let's<00:03:04.230> go<00:03:04.410> to<00:03:04.470> metadata<00:03:04.920> right<00:03:05.190> here<00:03:05.430> now<00:03:06.360> what

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
let's go to metadata right here now what

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.700 
let's go to metadata right here now what
is<00:03:06.690> that<00:03:07.220> metadata<00:03:08.220> is

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:09.710 
is that metadata is

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.550 
is that metadata is
information<00:03:10.280> on<00:03:10.460> the<00:03:10.700> file<00:03:10.940> it's<00:03:11.360> name<00:03:11.780> when

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
information on the file it's name when

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.340 
information on the file it's name when
it<00:03:12.710> was<00:03:12.860> taken<00:03:13.460> if<00:03:13.640> you've<00:03:13.760> got<00:03:13.940> GPS<00:03:14.630> data<00:03:15.050> it

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
it was taken if you've got GPS data it

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.370 
it was taken if you've got GPS data it
would<00:03:15.560> be<00:03:15.740> the<00:03:15.920> location<00:03:16.340> shot<00:03:17.080> things<00:03:18.080> like

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
would be the location shot things like

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.070 
would be the location shot things like

and a ton more that's metadata you can

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.900 
and a ton more that's metadata you can
see<00:03:24.230> some<00:03:24.500> of<00:03:24.530> it<00:03:24.710> right<00:03:24.950> over<00:03:25.310> here<00:03:25.610> in<00:03:25.790> this

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
from that point it's kind of like
