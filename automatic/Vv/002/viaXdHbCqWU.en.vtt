description instead so start with the
brows<00:00:31.260> I<00:00:31.560> don't<00:00:31.920> really<00:00:32.070> do<00:00:32.219> much<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.610> them

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
brows I don't really do much to them

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.880 
brows I don't really do much to them
nowadays<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:34.050> just<00:00:34.320> follow<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.710> natural

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
nowadays and I just follow the natural

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.160 
nowadays and I just follow the natural
shape<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.670> still<00:00:35.969> use<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.149> brow<00:00:36.360> pencil<00:00:36.600> or<00:00:37.140> a

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
shape I still use a brow pencil or a

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.889 
shape I still use a brow pencil or a
powder<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.890> fill<00:00:38.070> them<00:00:38.250> in<00:00:38.340> but<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.270> you

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
powder to fill them in but and you

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.600 
powder to fill them in but and you
should<00:00:40.050> try<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.230> make<00:00:40.379> them<00:00:40.559> way<00:00:41.040> more<00:00:41.070> arched

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
should try to make them way more arched

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.280 
should try to make them way more arched
than<00:00:41.820> what<00:00:41.969> they<00:00:42.120> are<00:00:42.149> because<00:00:42.930> they're<00:00:43.050> quite

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
than what they are because they're quite

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.350 
than what they are because they're quite
flat<00:00:43.590> but<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.280> just<00:00:44.670> come<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.940> terms<00:00:45.120> with<00:00:45.270> that

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
flat but I just come to terms with that

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.270 
flat but I just come to terms with that
now<00:00:45.629> I've<00:00:45.840> just<00:00:45.870> accepted<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.770> they're<00:00:47.010> flat

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
now I've just accepted that they're flat

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.639 
now I've just accepted that they're flat
and<00:00:47.610> that's<00:00:48.059> okay<00:00:48.450> because<00:00:49.020> they<00:00:49.289> just<00:00:49.410> follow

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
and that's okay because they just follow

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.380 
and that's okay because they just follow
the<00:00:49.829> natural<00:00:49.980> shape<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.670> makes<00:00:50.940> fill<00:00:51.180> in<00:00:51.300> the

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
the natural shape it makes fill in the

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.150 
the natural shape it makes fill in the
moon<00:00:51.539> easier<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.350> quicker<00:00:52.469> instead<00:00:53.039> of

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
moon easier and quicker instead of

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.189 
moon easier and quicker instead of
shaking<00:00:53.309> like<00:00:53.640> 15<00:00:54.360> minutes<00:00:54.570> like<00:00:54.870> they<00:00:54.989> used

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
shaking like 15 minutes like they used

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.770 
shaking like 15 minutes like they used

it<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:01.620> I'm<00:01:02.250> not<00:01:02.489> sure<00:01:02.550> about<00:01:02.820> adding<00:01:03.449> fullness

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
it is I'm not sure about adding fullness

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.719 
it is I'm not sure about adding fullness
as<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.439> haven't<00:01:04.710> really<00:01:04.979> tried<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.280> by<00:01:05.400> itself

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
as I haven't really tried it by itself

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.700 
as I haven't really tried it by itself
yet<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.390> always<00:01:06.600> have<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:06.810> base<00:01:07.170> color<00:01:07.500> so

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
yet and I always have that base color so

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.100 
yet and I always have that base color so
you<00:01:07.799> can't<00:01:08.010> really<00:01:08.130> tell<00:01:08.250> but<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.540> keeps<00:01:09.900> those

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
you can't really tell but it keeps those

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.200 
you can't really tell but it keeps those
brows<00:01:10.409> in<00:01:10.560> place<00:01:10.590> mine<00:01:11.430> usually<00:01:11.610> stick<00:01:12.060> out

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
brows in place mine usually stick out

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.270 
brows in place mine usually stick out
everywhere<00:01:12.930> but<00:01:13.380> this<00:01:13.619> really<00:01:13.799> helps<00:01:14.130> keep

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
everywhere but this really helps keep

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.010 
everywhere but this really helps keep
everything<00:01:14.549> in<00:01:14.760> check<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.240> just<00:01:15.420> keep

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
everything in check and just keep

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.380 
everything in check and just keep
everything<00:01:16.320> nice<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:16.920> flat<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.610> where<00:01:18.240> it

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
everything nice and flat and where it

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.660 
everything nice and flat and where it
should<00:01:18.420> be<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:19.080> as<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.590> can<00:01:19.710> see<00:01:19.950> I'm<00:01:20.250> still

everywhere<00:01:27.240> but<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:28.229> just<00:01:28.439> wait<00:01:28.650> for<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.829> to

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
everywhere but you just wait for it to

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.499 
everywhere but you just wait for it to
dry<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.430> then<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.579> will<00:01:29.759> just<00:01:29.850> flake<00:01:30.119> off<00:01:30.299> with

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
hard but maybe twenty-five really needs

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.340

shadow<00:03:32.989> you<00:03:33.890> don't<00:03:34.070> really<00:03:34.280> need<00:03:34.459> to<00:03:34.580> set<00:03:34.760> it

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
shadow you don't really need to set it

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.340 
shadow you don't really need to set it
in<00:03:34.910> place<00:03:34.970> because<00:03:35.420> it<00:03:35.600> will<00:03:35.750> dry<00:03:35.900> by<00:03:36.080> itself

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
in place because it will dry by itself

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.350 
in place because it will dry by itself
but<00:03:36.769> I<00:03:36.920> just<00:03:37.160> like<00:03:37.310> how<00:03:37.459> it<00:03:37.489> smoothes<00:03:37.910> up<00:03:38.150> the

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
but I just like how it smoothes up the

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.790 
but I just like how it smoothes up the
edges<00:03:38.720> and<00:03:38.989> just<00:03:39.050> makes<00:03:39.380> everything<00:03:39.650> look

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
edges and just makes everything look

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:49.229 
edges and just makes everything look
really<00:03:39.950> neat<00:03:40.400> and<00:03:40.580> tidy

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239

carrying on with the warm colors I used
a<00:03:52.129> brown<00:03:52.459> liner<00:03:52.730> instead<00:03:53.090> of<00:03:53.209> a<00:03:53.299> black<00:03:53.510> one<00:03:53.780> on
