Hawking about this is just insane oh
what<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.529> little<00:00:31.679> past<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.189> there<00:00:33.649> look<00:00:34.649> at<00:00:34.829> that

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
what a little past it there look at that

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.430 
what a little past it there look at that
right<00:00:35.760> there<00:00:35.969> next<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.329> mercury<00:00:36.719> and

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.900 

obviously<00:00:40.440> it's<00:00:40.770> cloaked<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.489> does<00:00:41.760> not

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
obviously it's cloaked and does not

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.760 
obviously it's cloaked and does not
appear<00:00:42.300> until<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.690> CME<00:00:43.350> hits<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:45.770> pretty

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
appear until the CME hits it pretty

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.860 
appear until the CME hits it pretty
freakin<00:00:47.160> amazing<00:00:47.250> I'm<00:00:48.090> going<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.329> magnify<00:00:48.690> it

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
freakin amazing I'm going to magnify it

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.619 
freakin amazing I'm going to magnify it
here<00:00:49.110> in<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.260> second<00:00:49.710> but<00:00:49.969> you<00:00:50.969> clearly<00:00:51.270> see

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
here in a second but you clearly see

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.900 
here in a second but you clearly see
it's<00:00:51.780> not<00:00:52.050> there<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.680> then<00:00:52.860> as<00:00:53.250> soon<00:00:53.489> as<00:00:53.670> the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
it's not there and then as soon as the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.209 
it's not there and then as soon as the
CME<00:00:54.629> goes<00:00:55.050> past<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.920> appears<00:00:56.690> time<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.899> well

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
CME goes past it it appears time to well

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:04.640 
CME goes past it it appears time to well
the<00:00:59.219> magnifier<00:00:59.760> here<00:01:00.710> check<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.829> out<00:01:03.650> okay

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
the magnifier here check it out okay

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.179 
the magnifier here check it out okay
holy<00:01:05.010> smokes<00:01:05.400> look<00:01:05.790> at<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:07.130> that<00:01:08.130> is

holy smokes look at that that is
definitely<00:01:09.150> some<00:01:09.930> sort<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:12.830> manufactured

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
definitely some sort of manufactured

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.219 
definitely some sort of manufactured
object<00:01:14.369> it's<00:01:14.640> cylindrical<00:01:15.330> on<00:01:15.689> either<00:01:15.840> side

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
object it's cylindrical on either side

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.800 
object it's cylindrical on either side
has<00:01:17.070> shape<00:01:18.030> in<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.299> middle<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.750> it

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
has shape in the middle and it

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.359 
has shape in the middle and it
definitely<00:01:19.080> looks<00:01:19.470> like<00:01:19.530> ship<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.070> me<00:01:20.220> and

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
definitely looks like ship to me and

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.219 
definitely looks like ship to me and
very<00:01:21.090> obviously<00:01:21.659> it's<00:01:21.900> cloaked<00:01:22.970> this<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.229> if

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
very obviously it's cloaked this is if

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.289 
very obviously it's cloaked this is if
this<00:01:25.680> might<00:01:25.920> as<00:01:26.009> well<00:01:26.070> be<00:01:26.189> full<00:01:26.640> disclosure

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
than it's some sort of ship what object

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.319 
than it's some sort of ship what object
in<00:01:37.680> space<00:01:37.799> cloaks<00:01:38.400> itself<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:39.030> doesn't

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
in space cloaks itself and doesn't

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.499 
in space cloaks itself and doesn't
appear<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.869> until<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:41.070> gets<00:01:41.759> hit<00:01:41.970> by<00:01:42.119> energy

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
appear and until it gets hit by energy
