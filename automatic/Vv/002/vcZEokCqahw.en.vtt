brakes on a bull one kx250 I think other
years<00:00:17.430> are<00:00:17.610> affected<00:00:18.030> as<00:00:18.120> well<00:00:18.410> maybe<00:00:19.410> the

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
years are affected as well maybe the

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.130 
years are affected as well maybe the
99201<00:00:21.920> versions<00:00:22.920> I'm<00:00:23.100> not<00:00:23.280> sure<00:00:23.490> maybe

several<00:00:25.140> other<00:00:25.260> years<00:00:25.560> but<00:00:25.920> when<00:00:26.580> I<00:00:26.610> first

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
several other years but when I first

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.930 
several other years but when I first
bought<00:00:27.090> this<00:00:27.300> bike<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.930> brake<00:00:28.610> just<00:00:29.610> was

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:29.940 
bought this bike the brake just was

bought this bike the brake just was
horrible

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:30.930 
horrible

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.660 
horrible
and<00:00:32.180> before<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.210> rule<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.600> any<00:00:34.050> parts<00:00:34.670> the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
and before I rule that any parts the

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.639 
and before I rule that any parts the
fork<00:00:35.910> seals<00:00:36.180> were<00:00:36.390> leaking<00:00:36.749> which<00:00:37.199> leaked<00:00:37.440> oil

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
fork seals were leaking which leaked oil

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.700

all<00:00:37.949> over<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.370> brake<00:00:38.609> pads<00:00:38.910> so<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:40.140> got<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.440> video

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
all over the brake pads so I got a video

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.950 
all over the brake pads so I got a video
on<00:00:40.890> how<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.160> do<00:00:41.339> fork<00:00:41.640> seals<00:00:41.879> on<00:00:42.329> this<00:00:42.480> bike<00:00:42.690> I

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
on how to do fork seals on this bike I

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.899 
on how to do fork seals on this bike I
also<00:00:43.260> have<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.589> video<00:00:43.739> on<00:00:43.920> how<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.190> do<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.640> brake

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:44.909 
also have a video on how to do a brake

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:47.180 
also have a video on how to do a brake
pad<00:00:45.420> change<00:00:45.839> so<00:00:46.409> I<00:00:46.469> have<00:00:46.589> to<00:00:46.679> make<00:00:46.829> sure<00:00:46.980> that

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
pad change so I have to make sure that

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.009 
pad change so I have to make sure that
was<00:00:47.989> obviously<00:00:48.989> clean<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.219> whatnot<00:00:50.489> and

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:51.019 
was obviously clean and and whatnot and

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:53.540 
was obviously clean and and whatnot and
you<00:00:52.019> know<00:00:52.679> obviously<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.039> had<00:00:53.249> to<00:00:53.370> address

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
you know obviously I had to address

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.619 
you know obviously I had to address
those<00:00:53.819> issues<00:00:54.030> first

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
those issues first

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.880 
those issues first
also<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.289> scuffed<00:00:55.649> up<00:00:55.769> the<00:00:55.920> rotor<00:00:56.989> so<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.409> knew

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
also I scuffed up the rotor so I knew

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.629 
also I scuffed up the rotor so I knew
all<00:00:59.069> that<00:00:59.249> was<00:00:59.399> in<00:00:59.519> good<00:00:59.699> shape<00:01:00.949> blend<00:01:01.949> the

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:02.639 
all that was in good shape blend the

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:05.329 
all that was in good shape blend the
system<00:01:03.059> really<00:01:03.539> well<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.620> was<00:01:04.710> still<00:01:05.010> just

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
system really well and it was still just

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.030 
system really well and it was still just
really<00:01:05.820> mushy<00:01:06.690> if<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.229> want<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.470> call<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:07.860> and

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
really mushy if you want to call it and

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.340 
really mushy if you want to call it and
you<00:01:08.549> go<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.759> hit<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.060> brake<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.540> you'll<00:01:10.200> just

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
you go to hit the brake and you'll just

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.289 
you go to hit the brake and you'll just
fly<00:01:10.619> over<00:01:10.649> burns<00:01:11.219> I<00:01:11.549> mean<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.790> brakes<00:01:12.090> were

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
fly over burns I mean the brakes were

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.780 
fly over burns I mean the brakes were
just<00:01:12.600> horrible<00:01:13.159> and<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.280> know<00:01:14.369> I'm<00:01:14.460> comparing

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
just horrible and you know I'm comparing

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.149 
just horrible and you know I'm comparing
this<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.090> my<00:01:15.270> buddy<00:01:15.479> CRF<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.350> my<00:01:16.829> brother's

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
this to my buddy CRF and my brother's

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.090 
this to my buddy CRF and my brother's
YZF<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.320> I<00:01:19.320> just<00:01:19.920> was<00:01:20.100> not<00:01:20.130> happy<00:01:20.850> with<00:01:21.090> the

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
YZF and I just was not happy with the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.179 
YZF and I just was not happy with the
setup<00:01:23.210> so<00:01:24.210> I<00:01:24.630> did<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.350> little<00:01:25.500> reading<00:01:25.829> and

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
setup so I did a little reading and

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.730 
setup so I did a little reading and
there's<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.729> couple<00:01:26.850> theories<00:01:27.299> out<00:01:27.450> there

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
there's a couple theories out there

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.840 
there's a couple theories out there
people<00:01:28.740> are<00:01:28.829> saying<00:01:29.039> it's<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.250> master<00:01:29.729> it's

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
people are saying it's the master it's

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.010 
people are saying it's the master it's
the<00:01:30.000> line<00:01:30.619> who<00:01:31.619> knows<00:01:32.390> so<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.509> first<00:01:33.719> thing<00:01:33.899> I

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
the line who knows so the first thing I

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.800 
the line who knows so the first thing I
did<00:01:34.079> is<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.439> swapped<00:01:34.799> in<00:01:35.070> an<00:01:35.460> O<00:01:35.729> five<00:01:36.149> or<00:01:36.630> an<00:01:36.719> O

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
did is I swapped in an O five or an O

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.700 
did is I swapped in an O five or an O
for<00:01:37.520> kxf<00:01:38.520> master<00:01:39.030> whether<00:01:39.240> it's<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.479> 250<00:01:40.049> or<00:01:40.140> 450

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
for kxf master whether it's a 250 or 450

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.630 
for kxf master whether it's a 250 or 450
F<00:01:41.000> I<00:01:42.000> swapped<00:01:42.570> in<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.869> new<00:01:43.049> master<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:43.920> was

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
F I swapped in a new master and that was

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.120 
F I swapped in a new master and that was
better<00:01:44.880> however<00:01:45.539> it<00:01:46.049> still<00:01:46.380> was<00:01:46.680> not<00:01:46.710> the

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
better however it still was not the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.450 
better however it still was not the
one-finger<00:01:47.820> breaking<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:49.070> the<00:01:50.070> Honda's

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
one-finger breaking that the Honda's

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.190 
one-finger breaking that the Honda's
have<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.880> mean<00:01:51.210> Honda's<00:01:51.570> really<00:01:51.810> had<00:01:51.990> good

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
have I mean Honda's really had good

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.919 
have I mean Honda's really had good
brakes<00:01:52.560> in<00:01:52.950> my<00:01:53.100> opinion<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:54.240> was<00:01:54.659> kind<00:01:54.869> of

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:54.929 
brakes in my opinion and I was kind of

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:58.130 
brakes in my opinion and I was kind of
shooting<00:01:55.170> for<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:56.030> so<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.359> went<00:01:57.570> ahead<00:01:57.689> and

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
shooting for that so I went ahead and

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.040 
shooting for that so I went ahead and
ordered<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.799> whole<00:01:59.100> brake<00:01:59.460> setup<00:01:59.820> off

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
ordered a whole brake setup off

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.610 
ordered a whole brake setup off
all<00:02:01.470> six<00:02:01.920> CRF<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:03.090> actually<00:02:03.540> looked<00:02:04.170> into<00:02:04.290> fishy

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
all six CRF I actually looked into fishy

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.730 
all six CRF I actually looked into fishy
finders<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.160> all<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.730> parts<00:02:06.660> have<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.500> same

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
finders and all the parts have the same

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.950 
finders and all the parts have the same
part<00:02:08.250> number<00:02:08.280> pretty<00:02:08.670> much<00:02:08.850> so<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.210> the<00:02:09.360> you

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
part number pretty much so that the you

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.120 
part number pretty much so that the you
know<00:02:09.990> it<00:02:10.110> doesn't<00:02:10.350> really<00:02:10.440> matter<00:02:10.710> what<00:02:10.920> year

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
know it doesn't really matter what year

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.330 
know it doesn't really matter what year
you<00:02:11.310> get<00:02:11.460> off<00:02:11.670> of<00:02:11.850> so<00:02:12.570> I<00:02:12.630> swapped<00:02:13.080> on<00:02:13.500> a<00:02:13.830> Honda

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
you get off of so I swapped on a Honda

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.780 
you get off of so I swapped on a Honda
CRF<00:02:14.850> master<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:15.720> man<00:02:16.020> it<00:02:16.350> is<00:02:16.490> night<00:02:17.490> and<00:02:17.670> day

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
CRF master and man it is night and day

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.980 
CRF master and man it is night and day
difference<00:02:18.270> it's<00:02:18.860> almost<00:02:19.860> at<00:02:20.070> a<00:02:20.130> point<00:02:20.310> where

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
difference it's almost at a point where

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.260 
difference it's almost at a point where
yeah<00:02:21.990> I'm<00:02:22.110> just<00:02:22.320> very<00:02:22.500> happy<00:02:22.860> with<00:02:23.010> it<00:02:23.240> now<00:02:24.240> I

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
yeah I'm just very happy with it now I

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.910 
yeah I'm just very happy with it now I
bought<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:25.110> whole<00:02:25.350> master<00:02:26.280> line<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:27.090> caliber

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
bought the whole master line and caliber

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.150 
bought the whole master line and caliber
the<00:02:28.920> caliper<00:02:29.430> pistons<00:02:29.910> are<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.900> same<00:02:31.140> size<00:02:31.470> so

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
the caliper pistons are the same size so

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.550 
the caliper pistons are the same size so
I<00:02:32.190> knew<00:02:32.430> that<00:02:32.780> you<00:02:33.780> know<00:02:33.900> there's<00:02:34.080> no<00:02:34.230> point<00:02:34.470> of

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
I knew that you know there's no point of

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.350 
I knew that you know there's no point of
swapping<00:02:34.950> calipers<00:02:35.490> or<00:02:35.730> I<00:02:35.910> just<00:02:35.940> wanted<00:02:36.240> to

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
swapping calipers or I just wanted to

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.810 
swapping calipers or I just wanted to
study<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:36.750> system<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:37.140> little<00:02:37.230> more<00:02:37.610> the<00:02:38.610> rotor

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
study the system a little more the rotor

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.970 
study the system a little more the rotor
size<00:02:39.150> I<00:02:39.540> cannot<00:02:39.930> comment<00:02:40.230> on<00:02:40.500> I<00:02:40.620> don't<00:02:40.680> know<00:02:40.830> if

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
size I cannot comment on I don't know if

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.700 
size I cannot comment on I don't know if
this<00:02:41.220> rotor<00:02:41.520> size<00:02:41.970> is<00:02:42.240> larger<00:02:43.080> smaller<00:02:43.440> than

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
this rotor size is larger smaller than

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:50.210 
this rotor size is larger smaller than
the<00:02:43.830> CRF<00:02:44.280> but<00:02:45.620> in<00:02:46.620> any<00:02:46.800> case<00:02:47.030> you<00:02:48.030> know<00:02:48.150> I<00:02:49.220> think

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
the CRF but in any case you know I think

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.910 
the CRF but in any case you know I think
just<00:02:50.520> the<00:02:50.820> master<00:02:51.210> swap<00:02:51.510> alone<00:02:51.920> helped

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
just the master swap alone helped

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.170 
just the master swap alone helped
greatly<00:02:53.450> so<00:02:54.450> it's<00:02:54.570> a<00:02:54.660> bolt-on<00:02:55.140> deal<00:02:55.470> I<00:02:56.000> I'm<00:02:57.000> not

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
greatly so it's a bolt-on deal I I'm not

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.760 
greatly so it's a bolt-on deal I I'm not
going<00:02:57.330> to<00:02:57.390> do<00:02:57.510> it<00:02:57.540> in<00:02:57.720> this<00:02:57.810> video<00:02:57.990> I<00:02:58.410> am<00:02:58.590> going

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
going to do it in this video I am going

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.470 
going to do it in this video I am going
to<00:02:58.860> link<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.190> a<00:02:59.220> video<00:02:59.400> where<00:02:59.610> I<00:02:59.820> rebuild<00:03:00.360> a

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
replacing all the seals in here and you

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.630 
replacing all the seals in here and you

know taking out and off and you can see

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.500 
know taking out and off and you can see
how<00:03:09.140> I<00:03:10.670> believe<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.790> brakes<00:03:12.030> in<00:03:12.360> that

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
how I believe the brakes in that

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.199 
how I believe the brakes in that
situation<00:03:13.050> but<00:03:13.739> notice<00:03:14.100> how<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.340> line<00:03:14.670> comes

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
situation but notice how the line comes

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.520 
situation but notice how the line comes
straight<00:03:15.600> off<00:03:15.930> of<00:03:16.170> here<00:03:16.610> on<00:03:17.610> the<00:03:17.640> KX<00:03:18.530> kxf

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
and a slight Bend so clearance is very

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.510 
and a slight Bend so clearance is very

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
tight right here on the handlebars and I

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.460 
tight right here on the handlebars and I
like<00:03:26.730> my<00:03:26.910> lover<00:03:27.150> is<00:03:27.239> really<00:03:27.510> high<00:03:27.720> almost

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
like my lover is really high almost

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.660 
like my lover is really high almost
level<00:03:28.709> so<00:03:29.700> it<00:03:29.910> is<00:03:30.739> kind<00:03:31.739> of<00:03:31.830> tight<00:03:32.070> in<00:03:32.220> here<00:03:32.370> it

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
level so it is kind of tight in here it

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:38.620 
level so it is kind of tight in here it
works<00:03:35.239> you<00:03:36.239> know<00:03:36.330> I'm<00:03:36.690> gonna<00:03:36.840> live<00:03:37.050> with<00:03:37.200> it

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630

another<00:03:39.739> theory<00:03:40.739> is<00:03:40.920> that<00:03:41.010> people<00:03:41.610> say<00:03:41.970> that

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
another theory is that people say that

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.320 
another theory is that people say that
the<00:03:42.390> brake<00:03:42.600> line<00:03:42.840> gets<00:03:43.080> all<00:03:43.290> in<00:03:43.620> an<00:03:43.739> expanse

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
the brake line gets all in an expanse

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.870 
the brake line gets all in an expanse
well<00:03:45.870> the<00:03:46.290> Honda's<00:03:46.800> pretty<00:03:47.370> much<00:03:47.550> have<00:03:47.760> the

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
well the Honda's pretty much have the

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.390 
well the Honda's pretty much have the
same<00:03:47.910> brake<00:03:48.540> line<00:03:48.810> construction<00:03:49.560> this

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
same brake line construction this

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.610 
same brake line construction this
routing<00:03:50.940> is<00:03:51.030> a<00:03:51.060> little<00:03:51.300> different<00:03:51.750> I<00:03:51.959> would

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
routing is a little different I would

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.740 
routing is a little different I would
say<00:03:52.770> it's<00:03:52.920> a<00:03:52.980> few<00:03:53.280> inches<00:03:53.310> longer<00:03:53.850> and<00:03:54.330> there's

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
say it's a few inches longer and there's

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.110 
say it's a few inches longer and there's
a<00:03:54.840> metal<00:03:55.080> pipe<00:03:55.290> on<00:03:55.500> the<00:03:55.590> bottom

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
a metal pipe on the bottom

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.300 
a metal pipe on the bottom
on<00:03:56.480> the<00:03:56.599> bottom<00:03:57.050> of<00:03:57.110> the<00:03:57.200> fork<00:03:57.470> versus<00:03:57.890> inside

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
on the bottom of the fork versus inside

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.180 
on the bottom of the fork versus inside
the<00:03:58.700> fork<00:03:59.030> and<00:03:59.150> down<00:03:59.390> to<00:03:59.720> the<00:03:59.810> caliper<00:04:00.160> but<00:04:01.160> I

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
the fork and down to the caliper but I

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.610 
the fork and down to the caliper but I
just<00:04:01.910> wasn't<00:04:02.120> buying<00:04:02.450> that<00:04:02.690> I<00:04:02.750> mean<00:04:03.019> it<00:04:03.140> could

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
just wasn't buying that I mean it could

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.199 
just wasn't buying that I mean it could
make<00:04:03.890> that<00:04:04.129> big<00:04:04.400> of<00:04:04.519> a<00:04:04.580> difference<00:04:05.440> so<00:04:07.209> let's

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
make that big of a difference so let's

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.830 
make that big of a difference so let's
let's<00:04:09.220> let's<00:04:10.220> go<00:04:10.370> over<00:04:10.610> on<00:04:10.730> paper<00:04:11.000> some<00:04:11.690> of<00:04:11.780> the

let's let's go over on paper some of the

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.650 
let's let's go over on paper some of the

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:27.600 
create pressure and pressure is equal to
force<00:04:22.120> over<00:04:23.120> area<00:04:24.610> all<00:04:25.610> right<00:04:25.790> so<00:04:26.449> this<00:04:26.570> is<00:04:26.630> an

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
force over area all right so this is an

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.600 
force over area all right so this is an

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
psi this is in pounds this is an inches

squared

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.570 
squared
okay<00:04:33.430> the<00:04:34.430> force<00:04:34.790> is<00:04:35.180> constant<00:04:35.690> and<00:04:36.280> the<00:04:37.280> force

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
okay the force is constant and the force

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.879 
okay the force is constant and the force
is<00:04:37.910> your<00:04:38.450> two<00:04:38.690> fingers<00:04:39.080> pulling<00:04:39.470> on<00:04:39.590> the<00:04:39.710> lever

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
is your two fingers pulling on the lever

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:42.730 
is your two fingers pulling on the lever
that<00:04:40.130> hasn't<00:04:40.490> changed<00:04:40.700> between<00:04:41.120> the<00:04:41.740> KX

master and the CRF master or the Honda
master<00:04:48.320> I<00:04:48.500> think<00:04:49.190> what<00:04:49.340> they're<00:04:49.490> doing<00:04:49.550> is

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
master I think what they're doing is

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.570 
master I think what they're doing is
changing<00:04:50.210> the<00:04:50.450> bar<00:04:50.690> size<00:04:50.960> of<00:04:51.320> the<00:04:51.560> master<00:04:51.770> now

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
changing the bar size of the master now

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:53.980 
changing the bar size of the master now
I<00:04:52.610> haven't<00:04:53.000> taken<00:04:53.150> them<00:04:53.389> apart<00:04:53.720> because<00:04:53.810> I

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
I haven't taken them apart because I

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.650 
I haven't taken them apart because I
don't<00:04:54.139> want<00:04:54.260> to<00:04:54.320> ruin<00:04:54.440> the<00:04:54.650> dust<00:04:55.580> boot<00:04:55.880> and

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
don't want to ruin the dust boot and

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.570 
don't want to ruin the dust boot and
order<00:04:57.020> a<00:04:57.050> whole<00:04:57.169> new<00:04:57.320> kit<00:04:57.560> just<00:04:57.770> for<00:04:57.889> that<00:04:58.010> that

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
order a whole new kit just for that that

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.730 
order a whole new kit just for that that
reason<00:04:59.000> but<00:04:59.479> I'm<00:04:59.630> willing<00:05:00.050> to<00:05:00.200> bet<00:05:00.410> that<00:05:00.440> they

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
reason but I'm willing to bet that they

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.810 
reason but I'm willing to bet that they
decrease<00:05:01.370> the<00:05:01.580> area<00:05:01.940> of<00:05:02.440> the<00:05:03.440> bore<00:05:03.740> which<00:05:04.639> in

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
decrease the area of the bore which in

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.409 
decrease the area of the bore which in
turn<00:05:05.030> increases<00:05:05.300> the<00:05:05.840> pressure<00:05:06.080> and<00:05:07.240> you<00:05:08.240> get

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
turn increases the pressure and you get

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:11.379 
turn increases the pressure and you get
a<00:05:08.450> better<00:05:09.010> brake<00:05:10.010> signal<00:05:10.250> or<00:05:10.550> more<00:05:10.789> force<00:05:11.150> on

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:11.389 
a better brake signal or more force on

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:15.580 
a better brake signal or more force on
the<00:05:11.750> Pistons<00:05:12.250> so<00:05:14.320> so<00:05:15.320> you're<00:05:15.470> probably

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
the Pistons so so you're probably

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.050 
the Pistons so so you're probably
thinking<00:05:15.800> why<00:05:16.190> don't<00:05:16.250> they<00:05:16.460> just<00:05:16.490> decrease

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
thinking why don't they just decrease

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.790 
thinking why don't they just decrease
the<00:05:17.210> area<00:05:17.510> altogether<00:05:17.660> well<00:05:18.229> what<00:05:18.440> happens

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
the area altogether well what happens

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.029 
the area altogether well what happens
when<00:05:18.950> you<00:05:19.070> decrease<00:05:19.490> the<00:05:19.760> area<00:05:19.940> is<00:05:20.680> the<00:05:21.680> brakes

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:22.039 
when you decrease the area is the brakes

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:24.820 
when you decrease the area is the brakes
become<00:05:22.490> very<00:05:22.729> sensitive<00:05:23.330> you<00:05:23.750> do<00:05:24.380> want<00:05:24.620> the

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
become very sensitive you do want the

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.710 
become very sensitive you do want the
modulation<00:05:25.460> where<00:05:25.849> you<00:05:25.970> hit<00:05:26.150> the<00:05:26.180> brakes<00:05:26.539> a

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
modulation where you hit the brakes a

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.330 
modulation where you hit the brakes a
little<00:05:26.870> bit<00:05:27.139> you<00:05:27.380> slow<00:05:27.590> down<00:05:27.770> a<00:05:27.830> little<00:05:28.070> you

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
little bit you slow down a little you

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.850 
little bit you slow down a little you
hit<00:05:28.520> it<00:05:28.639> a<00:05:28.700> lot<00:05:28.849> and<00:05:29.240> you<00:05:30.229> know<00:05:30.320> you<00:05:30.380> slow<00:05:30.710> down

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
hit it a lot and you know you slow down

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.659 
hit it a lot and you know you slow down
quite<00:05:31.160> a<00:05:31.250> bit<00:05:31.510> if<00:05:32.510> you<00:05:32.720> go<00:05:32.930> too<00:05:32.990> small<00:05:33.680> on<00:05:33.979> the

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669 
quite a bit if you go too small on the

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:37.659 
quite a bit if you go too small on the
area<00:05:35.090> it's<00:05:36.080> gonna<00:05:36.260> be<00:05:36.440> like<00:05:36.590> an<00:05:36.680> on-off<00:05:37.070> light

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:37.669 
area it's gonna be like an on-off light

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:39.279 
area it's gonna be like an on-off light
switch<00:05:38.000> you're<00:05:38.810> not<00:05:38.900> gonna<00:05:39.020> have<00:05:39.139> any

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:39.289 
switch you're not gonna have any

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:43.240 
switch you're not gonna have any
modulation<00:05:39.889> and<00:05:40.310> as<00:05:41.090> you<00:05:41.750> decrease<00:05:42.349> the<00:05:42.680> bore

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
modulation and as you decrease the bore

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.620 
modulation and as you decrease the bore
size<00:05:43.580> the<00:05:44.389> travel<00:05:45.349> of<00:05:45.530> the<00:05:45.710> lever<00:05:46.330> will<00:05:47.330> be

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:47.630 
size the travel of the lever will be

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.810 
size the travel of the lever will be
greater<00:05:48.020> because<00:05:48.560> you<00:05:48.800> have<00:05:48.919> to<00:05:49.039> push<00:05:49.520> more

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:49.820 
greater because you have to push more

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.990 
greater because you have to push more
fluid<00:05:50.830> so<00:05:51.830> that<00:05:51.860> those<00:05:52.340> are<00:05:52.460> the<00:05:52.580> kinds<00:05:52.910> of

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 
fluid so that those are the kinds of

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.210 
fluid so that those are the kinds of
those<00:05:53.660> are<00:05:53.780> the<00:05:53.870> pros<00:05:54.080> and<00:05:54.110> cons<00:05:54.530> of<00:05:54.800> messing

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:55.220 
those are the pros and cons of messing

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.680 
those are the pros and cons of messing
with<00:05:55.250> these<00:05:56.060> variables<00:05:58.270> you<00:05:59.270> know<00:05:59.389> you<00:05:59.450> can

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
with these variables you know you can

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.339 
with these variables you know you can
get<00:05:59.780> a<00:05:59.840> longer<00:06:00.260> lever<00:06:01.150> and<00:06:02.150> and<00:06:02.539> whatnot<00:06:03.020> so

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:03.349 
get a longer lever and and whatnot so

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:06.610 
get a longer lever and and whatnot so
what<00:06:03.620> I<00:06:03.650> also<00:06:03.950> tried<00:06:04.310> to<00:06:04.340> do<00:06:04.610> is<00:06:04.880> position<00:06:05.620> you

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620 
what I also tried to do is position you

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.890 
what I also tried to do is position you

here's your here's your lever you don't

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:14.110 
here's your here's your lever you don't
want<00:06:12.410> to<00:06:12.470> grip<00:06:12.680> it<00:06:12.800> with<00:06:12.919> your<00:06:13.039> fingers<00:06:13.400> close

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120 
want to grip it with your fingers close

fingers way out on the lever so I get

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:32.499 
fingers way out on the lever so I get
more<00:06:28.009> leverage<00:06:28.400> on<00:06:29.389> the<00:06:29.630> lever<00:06:29.979> so<00:06:30.979> all<00:06:31.910> this

00:06:32.499 --> 00:06:32.509 
more leverage on the lever so all this

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:35.290 
more leverage on the lever so all this
really<00:06:33.069> helped<00:06:34.069> the<00:06:34.160> braking<00:06:34.550> system<00:06:34.729> all

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.300 
really helped the braking system all

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.689 
really helped the braking system all
right<00:06:35.419> real<00:06:35.599> quick<00:06:36.190> you<00:06:37.190> can<00:06:37.310> see<00:06:37.520> how<00:06:37.639> the

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:37.699 
right real quick you can see how the

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:42.249 
right real quick you can see how the
line<00:06:37.970> runs<00:06:38.960> underneath<00:06:39.470> the<00:06:41.020> bike<00:06:42.020> or

00:06:42.249 --> 00:06:42.259 
line runs underneath the bike or

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:44.260 
line runs underneath the bike or
underneath<00:06:42.500> the<00:06:42.650> fork<00:06:43.039> on<00:06:43.250> the<00:06:43.310> KX<00:06:43.819> and<00:06:44.060> on<00:06:44.120> all

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:44.270 
underneath the fork on the KX and on all

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.990 
underneath the fork on the KX and on all
Honda's<00:06:44.810> it<00:06:45.020> comes<00:06:45.229> over<00:06:46.159> here<00:06:46.400> it<00:06:46.610> sneaks

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:47.000 
Honda's it comes over here it sneaks

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.180 
Honda's it comes over here it sneaks
behind<00:06:47.449> the<00:06:47.630> fork<00:06:47.930> and<00:06:48.500> go<00:06:48.680> straight<00:06:48.919> to<00:06:49.039> the

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:51.190 
behind the fork and go straight to the

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:54.999 
behind the fork and go straight to the
caliper<00:06:52.780> so<00:06:53.780> this<00:06:54.050> is<00:06:54.199> all<00:06:54.349> eliminated<00:06:54.590> you

00:06:54.999 --> 00:06:55.009 
caliper so this is all eliminated you

00:06:55.009 --> 00:06:56.529 
caliper so this is all eliminated you
get<00:06:55.130> a<00:06:55.159> little<00:06:55.400> more<00:06:55.490> ground<00:06:55.759> clearance<00:06:56.120> and

00:06:56.529 --> 00:06:56.539 
get a little more ground clearance and

00:06:56.539 --> 00:06:58.600 
get a little more ground clearance and
you<00:06:56.900> don't<00:06:57.050> get<00:06:57.139> stuff<00:06:57.500> hitting<00:06:58.130> your<00:06:58.220> brake

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:58.610 
you don't get stuff hitting your brake

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:02.529 
you don't get stuff hitting your brake
line<00:06:58.849> which<00:06:59.180> you<00:06:59.780> know<00:06:59.900> can<00:07:00.440> be<00:07:00.470> an<00:07:00.650> issue<00:07:00.940> so<00:07:01.940> I

00:07:02.529 --> 00:07:02.539 
line which you know can be an issue so I

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:04.659 
line which you know can be an issue so I
do<00:07:02.659> have<00:07:02.960> the<00:07:03.110> brake<00:07:03.319> line<00:07:03.560> off<00:07:03.590> off<00:07:04.009> the<00:07:04.250> Honda

00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:04.669 
do have the brake line off off the Honda

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:08.469 
do have the brake line off off the Honda
I<00:07:05.000> would<00:07:05.479> have<00:07:05.599> to<00:07:05.720> buy<00:07:05.870> Oh<00:07:06.199> a<00:07:06.880> fork<00:07:07.880> guards<00:07:08.330> and

00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:08.479 
I would have to buy Oh a fork guards and

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:09.850 
I would have to buy Oh a fork guards and
modify<00:07:08.930> them<00:07:09.050> a<00:07:09.080> little<00:07:09.259> bit<00:07:09.380> to<00:07:09.500> put<00:07:09.530> it<00:07:09.740> on

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:09.860 
modify them a little bit to put it on

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.550 
modify them a little bit to put it on
here<00:07:10.099> and<00:07:10.130> it<00:07:10.400> have<00:07:10.550> the<00:07:10.669> clamp<00:07:11.169> for<00:07:12.169> the<00:07:12.349> line

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560 
here and it have the clamp for the line

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.379 
here and it have the clamp for the line
and<00:07:13.009> then<00:07:13.280> I<00:07:13.340> can<00:07:13.520> probably<00:07:13.639> put<00:07:13.940> up<00:07:14.060> behind

00:07:14.379 --> 00:07:14.389 
and then I can probably put up behind

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:16.659 
and then I can probably put up behind
the<00:07:14.570> line<00:07:14.599> on<00:07:14.990> here<00:07:15.259> or<00:07:15.800> better<00:07:16.070> yet<00:07:16.250> I<00:07:16.310> can<00:07:16.550> get

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:16.669 
the line on here or better yet I can get

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:18.520 
the line on here or better yet I can get
a<00:07:16.699> stainless<00:07:17.210> line<00:07:17.449> you<00:07:18.139> know<00:07:18.229> the<00:07:18.259> whole

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:18.530 
a stainless line you know the whole

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:21.070 
a stainless line you know the whole
argument<00:07:18.830> is<00:07:19.219> that<00:07:19.250> this<00:07:19.520> expands<00:07:20.060> and<00:07:20.419> you

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:21.080 
argument is that this expands and you

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.570 
argument is that this expands and you
know<00:07:21.169> the<00:07:21.349> pressure<00:07:21.620> just<00:07:21.889> expands<00:07:22.370> this

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:22.580 
know the pressure just expands this

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.330 
know the pressure just expands this
versus<00:07:23.080> directly<00:07:24.080> the<00:07:24.229> pressure<00:07:24.979> to<00:07:25.219> the

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:25.340 
versus directly the pressure to the

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.459 
versus directly the pressure to the
caliper<00:07:25.669> so<00:07:26.539> that<00:07:26.690> maybe<00:07:26.900> I'll<00:07:27.110> do<00:07:27.259> that<00:07:27.409> in

00:07:27.459 --> 00:07:27.469 
caliper so that maybe I'll do that in

00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:28.600 
caliper so that maybe I'll do that in
the<00:07:27.530> future<00:07:27.770> but<00:07:27.889> right<00:07:28.219> now<00:07:28.370> I'm<00:07:28.490> really

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:28.610 
the future but right now I'm really

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:32.610 
the future but right now I'm really
satisfied<00:07:29.330> with<00:07:29.360> with<00:07:30.080> how<00:07:30.229> it<00:07:30.380> stops<00:07:30.650> and

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:32.620 
satisfied with with how it stops and

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.629 
satisfied with with how it stops and
yeah<00:07:33.620> that's<00:07:33.770> pretty<00:07:33.979> much<00:07:34.159> it<00:07:34.370> for<00:07:34.400> this

00:07:34.629 --> 00:07:34.639 
yeah that's pretty much it for this

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:35.550 
yeah that's pretty much it for this
video

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:35.560

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:40.610 
can do a quick little clip on it and

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:42.670 
can do a quick little clip on it and
