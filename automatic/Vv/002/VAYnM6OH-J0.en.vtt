 light activity desire themselves work 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.420
 and it will work what we use 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.820
 for toys on toys we use 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.640

 notices and the dog hurts himself 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.220
 mucous gums and teeth therefore sticks 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.130
 trying to 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:59.150
 or just very fat even or 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.440
 trying to tank vases and on check puller 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.950
 choose what dogs most 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.920
 like 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.440
 I don't try 1 2 3 I look at what 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.300
 the dog is more responsive or it happens even 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.370
 so take two toys in hand that is 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.290

 dog won the circle of toys standing and 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.150
 the matter is such an experiment three times four and 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.910
 usually the dog chooses one and the same 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.070
 toy constantly and this toy to be 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.139
 maximum motivation maximum 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.669
 interest and maximum good occupation and 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:32.400
 Of course, the maximum result is 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:35.760
 can also accelerate on any toy 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.400

 exercise say a team walk and a couple 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.710
