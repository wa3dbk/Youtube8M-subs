of all gonna go through all these apps
we<00:00:35.730> have<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.880> calculator<00:00:36.450> like<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:37.260> let's<00:00:37.440> do

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
we have a calculator like you let's do

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.930 
we have a calculator like you let's do
five<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.370> it's<00:00:39.180> not<00:00:39.360> doing<00:00:39.540> anything

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
five and it's not doing anything

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.819 
five and it's not doing anything
yes<00:00:41.940> we<00:00:42.090> said<00:00:42.329> there<00:00:43.320> we<00:00:43.410> go<00:00:43.530> plus<00:00:43.800> 5<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.820> 60<00:00:45.570> yes

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
yes we said there we go plus 5 is 60 yes

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.569 
yes we said there we go plus 5 is 60 yes
then<00:00:48.200> that<00:00:49.200> didn't<00:00:49.440> make<00:00:49.680> any<00:00:49.980> sense<00:00:50.250> at<00:00:50.460> all

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
then that didn't make any sense at all

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:58.400 
then that didn't make any sense at all
oh<00:00:50.820> do<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:53.090> no<00:00:56.210> yes<00:00:57.239> yep<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.719> actually<00:00:58.109> works

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
oh do this no yes yep it actually works

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.119 
oh do this no yes yep it actually works
fine<00:00:59.180> so<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.210> guess<00:01:00.719> it's<00:01:00.960> useful<00:01:01.500> when<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.890> do

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
fine so I guess it's useful when you do

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.789 
fine so I guess it's useful when you do
something<00:01:03.090> with<00:01:03.270> stacks<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:04.019> trading<00:01:04.650> with

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
something with stacks and trading with

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.210 
something with stacks and trading with
other<00:01:04.830> people<00:01:05.810> yeah<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:07.080> kind<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.320> stuff<00:01:07.560> and

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
other people yeah that kind of stuff and

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.359 
other people yeah that kind of stuff and
then<00:01:08.430> we<00:01:08.670> have<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.119> GPS<00:01:09.689> which<00:01:10.170> does<00:01:11.070> nothing

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
then we have the GPS which does nothing

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.940 
then we have the GPS which does nothing
when<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:11.939> click<00:01:12.270> on<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.540> then<00:01:13.380> we<00:01:13.500> have<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.680> time

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
when I click on it then we have the time

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.929 
when I click on it then we have the time
which<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.580> clock<00:01:15.049> I'm<00:01:16.049> not<00:01:16.200> sure<00:01:16.380> what

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
which is the clock I'm not sure what

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:20.510 
which is the clock I'm not sure what
time<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.150> s<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.229> Minecraft<00:01:19.860> time<00:01:20.130> I

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
time this s is this the Minecraft time I

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.410 
time this s is this the Minecraft time I
think<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:22.100> and<00:01:23.100> it's<00:01:23.280> now<00:01:23.460> morning<00:01:23.820> so

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.550 

let's<00:01:27.050> see<00:01:27.260> I<00:01:27.830> think<00:01:28.490> so<00:01:29.150> and<00:01:29.240> the<00:01:30.200> airlocks

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560

nothing happens when I click on it and

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.940 
nothing happens when I click on it and
