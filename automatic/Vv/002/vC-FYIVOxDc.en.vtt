wanted a foundation for summer but I

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.100 
wanted a foundation for summer but I
bought<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.210> people<00:01:15.330> like<00:01:15.540> don't<00:01:15.689> use<00:01:15.900> it

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
the summer so I don't think that'll be a

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.710 
the summer so I don't think that'll be a
problem<00:01:20.580> because<00:01:21.000> people<00:01:21.030> say<00:01:21.479> they<00:01:21.600> have

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
problem because people say they have

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.179 
problem because people say they have
oily<00:01:22.049> skin<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.380> they<00:01:22.500> sweat<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:22.890> stuff<00:01:23.070> I

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
oily skin and they sweat and stuff I

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.249 
oily skin and they sweat and stuff I
don't<00:01:23.310> tend<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.700> really<00:01:23.970> sweat<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.689> lot<00:01:24.960> in<00:01:25.140> the

one side of my face right now they said
that<00:03:01.020> it<00:03:01.170> is<00:03:01.200> a<00:03:01.620> buildable<00:03:02.270> foundation<00:03:03.270> which

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
that it is a buildable foundation which

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.120 
that it is a buildable foundation which
means<00:03:03.690> you<00:03:03.870> can<00:03:04.050> build<00:03:04.230> it<00:03:04.380> up<00:03:04.470> to<00:03:04.650> use<00:03:04.800> it<00:03:04.980> to

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
means you can build it up to use it to

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.580 
means you can build it up to use it to
conceal<00:03:05.550> and<00:03:05.820> stuff<00:03:06.060> for<00:03:06.600> little<00:03:06.900> extra<00:03:07.290> spots

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
which is pretty cool

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.050 
which is pretty cool
it<00:03:09.660> does<00:03:09.930> look<00:03:10.140> quite<00:03:10.290> natural<00:03:10.620> on<00:03:11.190> me<00:03:11.370> it

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
it does look quite natural on me it

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.539 
it does look quite natural on me it
doesn't<00:03:12.239> really<00:03:12.390> look<00:03:12.780> so<00:03:12.840> cakey<00:03:13.590> just<00:03:14.370> have

to<00:03:14.760> work<00:03:14.970> with<00:03:15.000> it<00:03:17.150> so<00:03:18.150> this<00:03:18.510> is<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.900> side<00:03:19.140> that

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
to work with it so this is the side that

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.770 
to work with it so this is the side that
has<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.980> foundation<00:03:20.130> on<00:03:20.820> and<00:03:21.269> this<00:03:21.540> is<00:03:21.600> the

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.449 
side that doesn't you can see acne over
here<00:03:25.980> and<00:03:26.400> redness<00:03:27.350> over<00:03:28.350> here<00:03:28.590> looks<00:03:28.950> really

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
here and redness over here looks really

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.370 
here and redness over here looks really
quite<00:03:29.700> nice<00:03:30.299> or<00:03:30.600> finish<00:03:30.959> I<00:03:31.370> wouldn't<00:03:32.370> say<00:03:32.580> it's

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
quite nice or finish I wouldn't say it's

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.990 
quite nice or finish I wouldn't say it's
insanely<00:03:34.380> different<00:03:35.070> due<00:03:35.430> to<00:03:35.610> the<00:03:35.700> fact<00:03:35.910> that

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
insanely different due to the fact that

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.449 
insanely different due to the fact that
I<00:03:36.090> can<00:03:36.360> still<00:03:36.780> see<00:03:37.080> my<00:03:37.350> acne<00:03:37.769> right<00:03:38.010> here

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
I can still see my acne right here

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.680 
I can still see my acne right here
without<00:03:39.060> a<00:03:39.720> concealer<00:03:40.670> so<00:03:41.670> I<00:03:41.970> don't<00:03:42.180> see<00:03:42.390> how

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
without a concealer so I don't see how

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.020 
without a concealer so I don't see how
everyone's<00:03:43.080> going<00:03:43.380> nuts<00:03:43.680> about<00:03:43.860> that<00:03:44.370> but<00:03:44.760> I

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
everyone's going nuts about that but I

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.150 
everyone's going nuts about that but I
quite<00:03:45.600> like<00:03:45.900> it<00:03:46.110> I<00:03:46.230> actually<00:03:46.440> think<00:03:46.799> this<00:03:46.950> is<00:03:47.010> a

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
quite like it I actually think this is a

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.729 
quite like it I actually think this is a
nice<00:03:47.400> color<00:03:47.730> for<00:03:47.850> me<00:03:48.170> just<00:03:49.170> a<00:03:49.290> little<00:03:49.320> bit

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
nice color for me just a little bit

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.289 
nice color for me just a little bit
darker<00:03:49.980> which<00:03:50.310> is<00:03:50.430> kind<00:03:50.640> of<00:03:50.730> perfect<00:03:50.940> so<00:03:51.209> I'm

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
darker which is kind of perfect so I'm

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:52.970 
darker which is kind of perfect so I'm
going<00:03:51.540> to<00:03:51.570> apply<00:03:51.780> it<00:03:51.959> to<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.350> other<00:03:52.500> side<00:03:52.620> of

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
going to apply it to the other side of

00:03:52.980 --> 00:04:14.360 
going to apply it to the other side of
my<00:03:53.160> face<00:03:53.400> and<00:03:53.760> you<00:03:54.239> guys<00:03:54.420> shall<00:03:54.630> see<00:03:54.810> how<00:03:54.930> it<00:03:55.079> is

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.610 

so<00:04:15.370> this<00:04:15.819> is<00:04:16.090> the<00:04:16.359> finished<00:04:16.810> look<00:04:16.930> of<00:04:17.199> it<00:04:17.410> I

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
so this is the finished look of it I

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.599 
so this is the finished look of it I
think<00:04:17.769> it<00:04:18.250> is<00:04:18.549> a<00:04:18.820> okay<00:04:19.509> foundation<00:04:20.320> for<00:04:21.250> me<00:04:21.370> I

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
think it is a okay foundation for me I

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.270 
think it is a okay foundation for me I
don't<00:04:22.330> think<00:04:22.479> it's<00:04:22.630> really<00:04:23.440> worth<00:04:23.680> all<00:04:23.979> the

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
don't think it's really worth all the

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.870 
don't think it's really worth all the
hype<00:04:24.490> that<00:04:24.820> everyone's<00:04:25.539> going<00:04:25.870> crazy<00:04:26.020> about

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
hype that everyone's going crazy about

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.730 
hype that everyone's going crazy about
don't<00:04:27.880> get<00:04:28.030> me<00:04:28.150> wrong<00:04:28.180> it<00:04:28.509> does<00:04:29.050> have<00:04:29.500> nice

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
don't get me wrong it does have nice

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.520 
don't get me wrong it does have nice
complexion<00:04:30.729> I<00:04:30.940> don't<00:04:31.449> think<00:04:31.810> I<00:04:31.960> would<00:04:32.259> even

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
complexion I don't think I would even

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.260 
complexion I don't think I would even
need<00:04:33.009> a<00:04:33.930> pressed<00:04:34.930> foundation<00:04:35.560> powder<00:04:35.740> over<00:04:36.190> it

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
need a pressed foundation powder over it

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.029 
need a pressed foundation powder over it
because<00:04:37.270> it<00:04:37.419> does<00:04:37.690> dry<00:04:38.080> to<00:04:38.139> a<00:04:38.380> matte<00:04:38.830> finish

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
because it does dry to a matte finish

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:42.060 
because it does dry to a matte finish
which<00:04:39.400> I<00:04:39.550> love<00:04:40.210> very<00:04:40.509> very<00:04:41.080> much<00:04:41.440> I<00:04:41.830> think

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
which I love very very much I think

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.600 
which I love very very much I think
that's<00:04:42.280> really<00:04:42.550> cool<00:04:42.930> but<00:04:43.930> as<00:04:44.340> coverage<00:04:45.340> wise

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
that's really cool but as coverage wise

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.200 
that's really cool but as coverage wise
I<00:04:46.380> don't<00:04:47.380> think<00:04:47.650> it's<00:04:47.830> the<00:04:48.130> greatest<00:04:48.310> coverage

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
I don't think it's the greatest coverage

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.400 
I don't think it's the greatest coverage
but<00:04:49.660> I<00:04:49.720> don't<00:04:50.139> think<00:04:50.590> it's<00:04:50.979> bad<00:04:51.930> like<00:04:52.930> I<00:04:53.110> can

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
but I don't think it's bad like I can

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.830 
but I don't think it's bad like I can
still<00:04:53.710> see<00:04:53.949> my<00:04:54.160> acne<00:04:54.759> here<00:04:56.220> but<00:04:57.479> that<00:04:58.479> is<00:04:58.660> how

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
still see my acne here but that is how

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.290 
still see my acne here but that is how
it<00:04:58.990> is<00:04:59.080> people<00:04:59.320> do<00:04:59.590> say<00:04:59.800> it<00:05:00.430> is<00:05:00.639> better<00:05:00.820> to<00:05:00.940> use

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
it is people do say it is better to use

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.270 
it is people do say it is better to use
a<00:05:01.479> brush<00:05:01.990> with<00:05:02.289> it<00:05:02.320> rather<00:05:02.590> than<00:05:02.740> a<00:05:02.919> beauty

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
a brush with it rather than a beauty

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.850 
a brush with it rather than a beauty
blender<00:05:03.430> so<00:05:04.090> I<00:05:04.120> will<00:05:04.599> be<00:05:04.750> picking<00:05:05.080> up<00:05:05.199> a<00:05:05.440> brush

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
blender so I will be picking up a brush

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.159 
blender so I will be picking up a brush
from<00:05:06.490> the<00:05:06.550> elf<00:05:07.060> line<00:05:07.270> a<00:05:07.449> stippling<00:05:07.870> brush

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
from the elf line a stippling brush

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:10.260 
from the elf line a stippling brush
because<00:05:08.650> I<00:05:08.800> don't<00:05:09.220> have<00:05:09.400> one<00:05:09.550> of<00:05:09.580> those<00:05:09.789> so<00:05:10.060> I

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
because I don't have one of those so I

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.960 
because I don't have one of those so I
will<00:05:10.720> probably<00:05:11.110> be<00:05:11.590> doing<00:05:11.770> another<00:05:12.370> review<00:05:12.820> on
