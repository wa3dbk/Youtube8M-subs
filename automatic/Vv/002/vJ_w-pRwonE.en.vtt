yeah<00:02:40.470> they're<00:02:40.709> smaller<00:02:41.450> when<00:02:42.450> I<00:02:42.480> go<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:42.900> the

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
yeah they're smaller when I go to the

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.140 
yeah they're smaller when I go to the
grocery<00:02:43.260> store<00:02:43.709> and<00:02:43.830> I<00:02:43.920> buy<00:02:44.130> a<00:02:44.160> bag<00:02:44.550> of<00:02:44.790> mixed

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
grocery store and I buy a bag of mixed

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.090 
grocery store and I buy a bag of mixed
greens<00:02:45.480> what<00:02:45.930> am<00:02:46.050> I<00:02:46.110> getting<00:02:46.170> how<00:02:46.709> long<00:02:46.920> has

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
greens what am I getting how long has

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.010 
greens what am I getting how long has
that<00:02:47.130> been<00:02:47.310> someplace<00:02:47.910> before<00:02:48.510> it<00:02:48.600> gets<00:02:48.750> to<00:02:48.900> my

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
that been someplace before it gets to my

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.580 
that been someplace before it gets to my
table<00:02:49.260> well<00:02:50.070> that's<00:02:50.310> a<00:02:50.430> good<00:02:50.580> question<00:02:50.640> by<00:02:51.590> the

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
table well that's a good question by the

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.220 
table well that's a good question by the
way<00:02:53.010> that<00:02:53.400> they're<00:02:53.640> now<00:02:53.790> going<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:54.570> extremes

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
way that they're now going to extremes

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.130 
way that they're now going to extremes
and<00:02:55.560> re-engineering<00:02:56.520> food<00:02:57.030> crops<00:02:57.420> so<00:02:58.110> that

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
and re-engineering food crops so that

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.860 
and re-engineering food crops so that
they<00:02:58.410> have<00:02:58.560> longer<00:02:58.890> shelf<00:02:59.400> life<00:02:59.580> I<00:03:00.060> mean<00:03:00.600> it

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
they have longer shelf life I mean it

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.960 
they have longer shelf life I mean it
becomes<00:03:01.020> a<00:03:01.320> big<00:03:01.470> question<00:03:01.650> mark<00:03:01.890> how<00:03:02.340> long<00:03:02.670> has

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
becomes a big question mark how long has

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.479 
becomes a big question mark how long has
that<00:03:03.000> been<00:03:03.950> harvested<00:03:04.950> since<00:03:05.190> it's<00:03:05.340> been

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
that been harvested since it's been

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.460 
that been harvested since it's been
harvested<00:03:06.060> and<00:03:06.090> before<00:03:06.959> it<00:03:07.020> gets<00:03:07.200> to<00:03:07.380> your

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
harvested and before it gets to your

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.490 
harvested and before it gets to your
plate<00:03:07.680> and<00:03:08.100> the<00:03:09.030> quality<00:03:09.600> hat<00:03:09.840> and<00:03:10.080> the<00:03:10.200> flavor

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
plate and the quality hat and the flavor

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.280 
plate and the quality hat and the flavor
are<00:03:10.860> both<00:03:11.150> diminishing<00:03:12.150> as<00:03:12.330> time<00:03:12.690> progresses

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
are both diminishing as time progresses

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.039 
are both diminishing as time progresses
it's<00:03:14.040> just<00:03:14.250> inevitable<00:03:15.180> that<00:03:15.630> you<00:03:15.840> know<00:03:15.959> as

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
it's just inevitable that you know as

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.930 
it's just inevitable that you know as
you<00:03:16.080> long<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.769> longer<00:03:17.100> you<00:03:17.190> may<00:03:17.370> keep

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
you long the longer you may keep

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.110 
you long the longer you may keep
something<00:03:18.269> in<00:03:18.600> storage<00:03:19.340> it<00:03:20.340> just<00:03:20.580> appreciates

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
something in storage it just appreciates

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.930 
something in storage it just appreciates
as<00:03:21.299> far<00:03:21.540> as<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:22.160> quality<00:03:23.160> of<00:03:23.250> things<00:03:23.519> yeah<00:03:23.910> I

as far as the quality of things yeah I

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.740 
as far as the quality of things yeah I
appreciate<00:03:24.209> the<00:03:24.630> value<00:03:25.080> of<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.440> product<00:03:26.750> is

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
appreciate the value of the product is

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.170 
appreciate the value of the product is
on<00:03:27.959> tone<00:03:28.260> they<00:03:28.830> said<00:03:29.040> its<00:03:29.190> anti-cancer<00:03:29.970> that

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
on tone they said its anti-cancer that

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.539 
on tone they said its anti-cancer that
also<00:03:30.570> diminishes<00:03:31.140> everything<00:03:31.890> diminishes

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
also diminishes everything diminishes

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.140 
also diminishes everything diminishes
and<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.239> way<00:03:33.360> to<00:03:33.420> control<00:03:33.870> these<00:03:34.140> new

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
and the way to control these new

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.580 
and the way to control these new
technologies<00:03:36.150> is<00:03:36.450> by<00:03:36.630> the<00:03:36.690> consumer<00:03:37.260> first

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
technologies is by the consumer first

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.350 
technologies is by the consumer first
becoming<00:03:38.040> aware<00:03:38.400> of<00:03:38.459> what<00:03:38.730> the<00:03:38.880> issues<00:03:39.180> are

becoming aware of what the issues are

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.240 
becoming aware of what the issues are

ultimately you're going to steer

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.449 
ultimately you're going to steer
technology<00:03:49.500> in<00:03:49.650> a<00:03:49.709> different<00:03:49.739> direction

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
technology in a different direction

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.150 
technology in a different direction
fortunately<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.750> organic<00:03:52.170> sector<00:03:52.440> is<00:03:52.830> the

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
fortunately the organic sector is the

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.039 
fortunately the organic sector is the
largest<00:03:53.549> growing<00:03:54.030> sector<00:03:54.630> in<00:03:54.750> the<00:03:54.870> food

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
largest growing sector in the food

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
more aware that health is an issue you

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.370 
more aware that health is an issue you
can<00:03:59.040> either<00:03:59.310> save<00:04:00.120> money<00:04:00.450> on<00:04:00.690> food<00:04:00.959> and<00:04:01.200> pay

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
can either save money on food and pay

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.100 
can either save money on food and pay
the<00:04:01.560> doctor<00:04:02.010> or<00:04:02.220> just<00:04:02.700> pay<00:04:03.480> a<00:04:03.510> little<00:04:03.600> bit<00:04:03.810> more

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
the doctor or just pay a little bit more

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.720 
the doctor or just pay a little bit more
so<00:04:04.410> that<00:04:04.440> small<00:04:04.860> growers<00:04:05.250> can<00:04:05.459> give<00:04:05.579> you<00:04:05.670> a

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
better quality product and then avoid

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:13.670 
better quality product and then avoid
the<00:04:07.950> doctor

cane yeah our kids would when they were
younger<00:04:40.810> we<00:04:41.770> let<00:04:41.980> this<00:04:42.190> stuff<00:04:42.460> grow<00:04:42.760> up<00:04:43.000> and

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
younger we let this stuff grow up and

fill it a little bit more stocky and and

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.430 
fill it a little bit more stocky and and
then<00:04:45.700> chop<00:04:46.030> it<00:04:46.240> down<00:04:46.270> with<00:04:46.630> a<00:04:46.720> machete<00:04:47.080> and

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
then chop it down with a machete and

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.010 
then chop it down with a machete and
they<00:04:47.920> preferred<00:04:48.430> chewing<00:04:49.330> on<00:04:49.510> that<00:04:49.720> sugar

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
they preferred chewing on that sugar

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.960 
they preferred chewing on that sugar
cane<00:04:50.380> more<00:04:50.680> than<00:04:50.890> even<00:04:51.190> having<00:04:51.460> a<00:04:51.550> candy
