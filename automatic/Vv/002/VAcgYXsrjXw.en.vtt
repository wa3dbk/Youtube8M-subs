 rose edible let's move on to preparation 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.780
 first of all we dedicate ourselves to the base 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.790
 so rinses I love very well 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.900
 from the soaking water the oil seeds 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:32.570
 kakÃ  has chosen and we search them together with 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:37.510
 all other ingredients up to 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.510
 get a compact and colluded compound 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:52.220
 it is a slightly more soggy base 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:55.280
 compared to the classics given the presence 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.700
 dried pears we press the 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.320
 composed directly in the tray 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.390
 helping us with the form to get one 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.460
 perfect circumference we are 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.030
 doing freehand why not 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:09.620
 we have it available with your fingers 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:13.160
 moistened with rose water 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:16.790
 we leave the surface that will absorb the 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:20.000
 rome here we did the very wet 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:22.490
 fast with only rose water and now 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.650
 we wrap the base with films 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.230
 feed and let it cool 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.330
 in the refrigerator so that it compacts 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.550
 let's better dedicate ourselves now to 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.400
 preparation of the cream almonds with 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:37.000
 black cherry chocolate that we will need for the 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.890
 first and third filling layer 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.530
 then we whisk together all the 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:44.570
 ingredients excluding dried cherries e 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:50.840
 dark chocolate that we will add 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:53.990
 then we pour the mixture we have 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.660
 obtained in a container and add 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:59.800
 the small chocolate bar 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:03.460
 chopped dried cherries 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.460
 we amalgamate into everything 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:11.330
 Now let's take the base of the refrigerator from the fridge 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.850
 cake at this point in the meantime not 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.790
 miraculously the form reappeared 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:19.729
 zipper and now we pour little more than the 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.770
 half the cream the almonds the cream 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:24.410
 which will advance we will use it as a third party 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.280
 layer before putting the cream on 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.680
 butter 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.510
 place the cake in the fridge or in the freezer 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.750
 if we want to speed up the teeth of 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:35.810
 compaction is clearly there 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:38.660
 preparation of the next layer la 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:40.639
 cream the roses whip all the 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:44.470
 ingredients until a mixture is obtained 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:44.470
 creamy and thick 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.470
 we take back the cake and if the surface 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.740
 has hardened enough we spread it 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:06.440
 layer of cream with roses we cover it 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:09.580
 cream layer roses with cream 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:13.580
 almonds remained about a third 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:17.750
 here is a thin layer but 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:20.810
 then going to put the cream on 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:23.240
 butter which in any case of lesser quantity 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:26.180
 compared to the cream almonds we will go 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:29.210
 to create a white layer visually 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:31.130
 equal to the second layer of cream of 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:34.160
 almonds 

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:36.370
 now put in the fridge and dedicate ourselves 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:39.110
 to the preparation of the butter cream 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:43.570
 we whisk all the ingredients up to 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.570
 keep a very soft foam 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:07:00.170
 and now we coat with the butter cream 

00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:03.800
 the cake we take the cake from the fridge 

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:05.750
 and we free the form now 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.910
 we cover the entire surface of the 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:10.570
 cake with butter cream edges 

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.570
 included 

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:23.240
 at this point we can move on to 

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:25.250
 final decoration 

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.870
 we completely cover the surface 

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:29.030
 therefore also the villages of curls of 

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:30.890
 chocolate dialogue we must not do 

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:33.620
 other sees reach in the side of the bulls 

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:36.350
 of large of the cartridge the tablet 

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:39.230
 Here we finally decorate with some 

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:42.200
 rose petal the ducal cake is ready 

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:43.820
 a triumph of good seductive flavors 

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:46.960
 devolved kitchen goes to everyone next time 

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.960
