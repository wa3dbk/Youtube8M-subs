outside is an eyesore anyone who's seen
one<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:42.930> these<00:01:43.020> knows<00:01:43.380> they<00:01:43.619> look<00:01:43.770> absolutely

I'd<00:01:51.840> consider<00:01:52.290> for<00:01:52.590> tanks<00:01:52.860> like<00:01:53.009> this<00:01:53.220> and

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
I'd consider for tanks like this and

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.370 
I'd consider for tanks like this and
they've<00:01:53.850> become<00:01:54.000> hugely<00:01:54.570> popular<00:01:54.659> for

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
they've become hugely popular for

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.230 
they've become hugely popular for
everyone<00:01:55.680> here<00:01:55.920> at<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.100> office<00:01:56.520> I<00:01:56.729> honestly

everyone here at the office I honestly

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.209 
everyone here at the office I honestly
wasn't<00:01:57.420> sure<00:01:57.750> if<00:01:57.960> they'd<00:01:58.079> be<00:01:58.229> Estonian<00:01:58.530> larger

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
wasn't sure if they'd be Estonian larger

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.310 
wasn't sure if they'd be Estonian larger
tanks<00:01:59.610> but<00:01:59.759> after<00:02:00.119> putting<00:02:00.270> two<00:02:00.600> on<00:02:00.780> my<00:02:00.960> office

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320

tanks but after putting two on my office
tank<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:01.740> think<00:02:01.920> I'd<00:02:02.340> be<00:02:02.460> comfortable<00:02:02.909> using

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
tank I think I'd be comfortable using

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.389 
tank I think I'd be comfortable using
them<00:02:03.420> on<00:02:03.600> basically<00:02:03.960> any<00:02:04.259> sized<00:02:04.649> tank<00:02:05.009> the

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
them on basically any sized tank the

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.740 
them on basically any sized tank the
things<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:05.850> make<00:02:06.000> them<00:02:06.149> look<00:02:06.329> sharp<00:02:06.600> on

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
things that make them look sharp on

things that make them look sharp on
smaller<00:02:07.110> tanks<00:02:07.560> seem<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:07.890> apply<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.190> basically

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
smaller tanks seem to apply to basically

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.850 
smaller tanks seem to apply to basically
any<00:02:09.030> size<00:02:09.360> for<00:02:09.929> mounting<00:02:10.289> them<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.560> have<00:02:10.679> two

options you can hang them from the

unique little accessory which makes a

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
gooseneck even more low-profile does

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:37.399

raise<00:02:35.849> the<00:02:36.060> lights<00:02:36.269> a<00:02:36.420> bit<00:02:36.659> but<00:02:36.930> rather<00:02:37.200> than

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
raise the lights a bit but rather than

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:39.289

have<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.799> gooseneck<00:02:38.069> arched<00:02:38.670> down<00:02:38.909> you<00:02:39.180> can

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
have the gooseneck arched down you can

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.270 
have the gooseneck arched down you can
have<00:02:39.420> it<00:02:39.540> just<00:02:39.719> go<00:02:39.840> straight<00:02:40.200> out<00:02:40.230> something<00:02:41.159> I

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
have it just go straight out something I

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.250 
have it just go straight out something I
think<00:02:41.340> a<00:02:41.549> lot<00:02:41.579> of<00:02:41.879> people<00:02:42.150> will<00:02:42.359> appreciate<00:02:42.659> my

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
think a lot of people will appreciate my

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.750 
think a lot of people will appreciate my
only<00:02:43.500> complaint<00:02:43.889> would<00:02:43.980> be<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.250> lack<00:02:44.430> of<00:02:44.459> a

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
only complaint would be the lack of a

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.699 
only complaint would be the lack of a
really<00:02:45.000> good<00:02:45.150> cord<00:02:45.480> management<00:02:45.689> option<00:02:46.439> which

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
really good cord management option which

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.409 
really good cord management option which
is<00:02:46.919> something<00:02:47.159> I<00:02:47.400> think<00:02:47.459> a<00:02:47.730> lot<00:02:47.760> of<00:02:48.090> people

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:48.419 
is something I think a lot of people

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:50.899 
is something I think a lot of people
would<00:02:48.599> pay<00:02:48.840> for<00:02:49.169> if<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.439> existed<00:02:49.980> overall<00:02:50.879> I

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909 
would pay for if it existed overall I

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:53.179 
would pay for if it existed overall I
think<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.480> Kettle<00:02:51.810> 360<00:02:52.409> comes<00:02:52.650> in<00:02:52.859> really

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:53.189 
think the Kettle 360 comes in really

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:55.309 
think the Kettle 360 comes in really
high<00:02:53.370> an<00:02:53.579> external<00:02:54.090> aesthetic<00:02:54.540> appeal<00:02:54.900> okay

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
high an external aesthetic appeal okay

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:56.690 
high an external aesthetic appeal okay
so<00:02:55.379> most<00:02:55.650> of<00:02:55.829> you<00:02:55.919> care<00:02:56.129> more<00:02:56.280> about<00:02:56.340> what<00:02:56.639> it

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
so most of you care more about what it

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.459 
so most of you care more about what it
looks<00:02:56.730> like<00:02:57.000> inside<00:02:57.329> the<00:02:57.629> tank<00:02:57.659> if<00:02:58.109> you've

00:02:58.459 --> 00:02:58.469 
looks like inside the tank if you've

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:00.080 
looks like inside the tank if you've
seen<00:02:58.709> any<00:02:58.950> of<00:02:59.069> our<00:02:59.189> other<00:02:59.370> videos<00:02:59.669> we've<00:03:00.060> done

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
seen any of our other videos we've done

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.879

on<00:03:00.419> these<00:03:00.540> you<00:03:00.930> already<00:03:01.230> know<00:03:01.379> we're<00:03:01.560> in<00:03:01.650> love

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:01.889 
on these you already know we're in love

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:03.979 
on these you already know we're in love
with<00:03:02.129> the<00:03:02.280> shimmer<00:03:02.519> I've<00:03:03.150> never<00:03:03.480> been<00:03:03.689> able<00:03:03.900> to

the tank but even if you can't achieve

the tank but even if you can't achieve
that<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:18.479> shimmer<00:03:18.750> is<00:03:18.900> always<00:03:19.199> very

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:19.409 
that the shimmer is always very

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:21.140 
that the shimmer is always very
natural-looking<00:03:20.069> and<00:03:20.579> nothing<00:03:20.879> like<00:03:21.000> the

natural-looking and nothing like the

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
blending is what I'd call perfect as

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.089

well<00:03:27.299> with<00:03:27.750> many<00:03:27.930> LEDs<00:03:28.349> you<00:03:28.530> end<00:03:28.680> up<00:03:28.889> seeing

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
well with many LEDs you end up seeing

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:30.979 
well with many LEDs you end up seeing
red<00:03:29.370> and<00:03:29.639> green<00:03:29.849> specks<00:03:30.180> of<00:03:30.299> light<00:03:30.510> floating

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
red and green specks of light floating

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.140 
red and green specks of light floating
all<00:03:31.109> over<00:03:31.470> or<00:03:31.650> the<00:03:32.010> back<00:03:32.189> the<00:03:32.459> tank<00:03:32.699> looks<00:03:32.970> like

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
all over or the back the tank looks like

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.509 
all over or the back the tank looks like
it's<00:03:33.329> on<00:03:33.449> fire<00:03:33.750> with<00:03:34.319> the<00:03:34.439> 360<00:03:35.069> you<00:03:35.099> don't<00:03:35.340> see

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
it's on fire with the 360 you don't see

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.580 
it's on fire with the 360 you don't see
all<00:03:35.699> that<00:03:35.729> because<00:03:36.389> the<00:03:36.479> LEDs<00:03:36.900> are<00:03:37.139> packed<00:03:37.409> so

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
all that because the LEDs are packed so

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.770 
all that because the LEDs are packed so
tightly<00:03:37.919> together<00:03:38.189> under<00:03:38.790> a<00:03:38.819> single<00:03:39.150> lens<00:03:39.449> I

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
tightly together under a single lens I

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.689 
tightly together under a single lens I
have<00:03:40.109> to<00:03:40.260> say<00:03:40.439> I'm<00:03:40.650> also<00:03:40.859> impressed<00:03:41.400> with<00:03:41.519> the

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:41.699 
have to say I'm also impressed with the

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:43.610 
have to say I'm also impressed with the
color<00:03:41.939> in<00:03:42.180> a<00:03:42.269> way<00:03:42.299> I<00:03:42.419> didn't<00:03:42.840> think<00:03:42.989> I<00:03:43.169> would<00:03:43.229> be

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
color in a way I didn't think I would be

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.499 
color in a way I didn't think I would be
so<00:03:44.099> it's<00:03:44.280> obvious<00:03:44.729> that<00:03:44.759> the<00:03:44.970> color<00:03:45.209> spectrum

00:03:45.499 --> 00:03:45.509 
so it's obvious that the color spectrum

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:47.599 
so it's obvious that the color spectrum
is<00:03:45.840> much<00:03:46.109> wider<00:03:46.379> when<00:03:46.799> we<00:03:46.889> put<00:03:47.099> the<00:03:47.189> castle's

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
is much wider when we put the castle's

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:49.309 
is much wider when we put the castle's
over<00:03:47.849> the<00:03:47.970> tank<00:03:48.180> in<00:03:48.449> fact<00:03:48.780> if<00:03:48.900> you<00:03:48.989> look<00:03:49.169> at<00:03:49.229> the

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
over the tank in fact if you look at the

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.170 
over the tank in fact if you look at the
edge<00:03:49.470> with<00:03:49.799> a<00:03:49.829> light<00:03:50.069> lens<00:03:50.370> you<00:03:50.639> can<00:03:50.729> see<00:03:50.790> some

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
edge with a light lens you can see some

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.670 
edge with a light lens you can see some
of<00:03:51.209> the<00:03:51.359> different<00:03:51.689> colors<00:03:52.019> within<00:03:52.229> the<00:03:52.470> light

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
of the different colors within the light

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.830 
of the different colors within the light
which<00:03:53.040> have<00:03:53.189> been<00:03:53.310> separated<00:03:53.970> out<00:03:54.150> in<00:03:54.359> a<00:03:54.449> prism

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
which have been separated out in a prism

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.349 
which have been separated out in a prism
like<00:03:55.019> affect<00:03:55.409> I<00:03:55.650> can<00:03:56.069> see<00:03:56.220> red<00:03:56.519> deep<00:03:57.090> violet

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
like affect I can see red deep violet

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:59.599 
like affect I can see red deep violet
yellow<00:03:58.169> and<00:03:58.379> purple<00:03:58.560> one<00:03:59.129> of<00:03:59.250> the<00:03:59.310> things<00:03:59.489> I

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
yellow and purple one of the things I

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:01.339 
yellow and purple one of the things I
also<00:03:59.819> really<00:04:00.269> like<00:04:00.449> to<00:04:00.479> look<00:04:00.810> at<00:04:00.989> it's<00:04:01.139> price

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
also really like to look at it's price

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:03.110 
also really like to look at it's price
per<00:04:01.590> LED<00:04:02.069> and<00:04:02.280> at<00:04:02.400> four<00:04:02.579> hundred<00:04:02.639> and<00:04:02.849> fifty

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.539

dollars<00:04:03.540> with<00:04:03.689> 45<00:04:04.139> LEDs<00:04:04.680> these<00:04:05.040> come<00:04:05.280> out<00:04:05.400> to

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
dollars with 45 LEDs these come out to

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.909 
dollars with 45 LEDs these come out to
just<00:04:05.879> under<00:04:06.150> ten<00:04:06.389> dollars<00:04:06.810> per<00:04:07.019> LED<00:04:07.470> which<00:04:07.739> is

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:07.919 
just under ten dollars per LED which is

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:09.199 
just under ten dollars per LED which is
less<00:04:08.099> than<00:04:08.220> half<00:04:08.280> of<00:04:08.729> some<00:04:08.909> of<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.060> more

expensive options in fact the Kessel 360

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.729 
expensive options in fact the Kessel 360
comes<00:04:12.030> in<00:04:12.209> amongst<00:04:12.569> the<00:04:12.599> lowest<00:04:13.079> cost<00:04:13.290> retail

options out there when cost per LED is

options out there when cost per LED is
considered<00:04:16.500> moving<00:04:16.919> on<00:04:17.190> I<00:04:17.220> think

considered moving on I think

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.189 
considered moving on I think
controllability<00:04:18.449> is<00:04:18.539> going<00:04:18.750> to<00:04:18.840> be<00:04:18.959> one<00:04:19.109> of

controllability is going to be one of

controllability is going to be one of

something pretty satisfying about

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
programming options but i have to be

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.790 
programming options but i have to be
honest<00:05:00.060> I<00:05:00.240> really<00:05:00.270> like<00:05:00.720> the<00:05:00.870> simplicity<00:05:01.500> here

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800

recommend this light too based on this
alone<00:05:05.760> I<00:05:06.000> know<00:05:06.389> this<00:05:06.750> is<00:05:06.900> going<00:05:07.110> to<00:05:07.199> be

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
alone I know this is going to be

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.930 
alone I know this is going to be
attractive<00:05:07.860> to<00:05:07.979> a<00:05:08.010> lot<00:05:08.070> of<00:05:08.280> you<00:05:08.490> who<00:05:08.610> don't

attractive to a lot of you who don't

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.879

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:10.889 
want to spend hours programming that's

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:12.170 
want to spend hours programming that's
not<00:05:11.100> to<00:05:11.220> say<00:05:11.400> that<00:05:11.580> it<00:05:11.669> doesn't<00:05:11.820> have<00:05:12.000> any

not to say that it doesn't have any
fancy<00:05:12.539> programming<00:05:13.320> options<00:05:13.500> because<00:05:14.100> you

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
fancy programming options because you

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.040 
fancy programming options because you
can<00:05:14.430> hook<00:05:14.669> it<00:05:14.789> up<00:05:14.880> to<00:05:14.940> controllers<00:05:15.690> like<00:05:15.870> the

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
can hook it up to controllers like the

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.140 
can hook it up to controllers like the
Neptune<00:05:16.530> to<00:05:16.800> change<00:05:17.160> the<00:05:17.310> intensity<00:05:17.820> of<00:05:18.030> the

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
certainly something you'll end up doing
