00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.860
 you tonight because unfortunately for 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.259
 previous commitments I am in Spain a 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.830
 madrid wanted to take advantage of this 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.670
 opportunity 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.740
 anyway to send you a wish for the 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.990
 success of this beautiful evening of 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.070
 golden egg that I'm sure you have 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:29.369
 organized with the usual creativity e 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.340
 attention to detail I remembered today when 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.579
 we met was 1998 then 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.340
 13 years ago we were all smaller not 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.840
 only of age but also of experience I was 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.040
 here for a short time 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.230
 you had just founded your company e 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.710
 of water has passed under the bridges 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.480
 I know you often say that we have 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.489
 contributed to the success of yours 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.840
 company 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:58.670
 and if this is true I can guarantee you 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.670
 that the opposite is also true 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.899
 thanks to your training at 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.710
 determination that you have allowed to 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.979
 our boys 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.720
 today we can say that we have become 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.540
 a successful company 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.680
 I wanted to remind you of two issues at the time 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.840
 we did about 120 billion of the 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.610
 old lire equivalent therefore to approx 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:27.689
 Current 60 million euros with three points 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.030
 sale and today is 13 years apart 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.509
 the company is close to 700 million euros 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.540
 with 70 points of sale scattered in the center 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.579
 northern Italy and over 1,600 employees 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.170
 so street as I told you about it 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.869

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.090
 so do you too 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.340
 and therefore thanks to the determination to the 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.740
 proactivity you forwarded to 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.090

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:56.009
 the same as we are today 13 years ago 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.780

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.700

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.340
