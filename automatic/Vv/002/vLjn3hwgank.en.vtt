time<00:01:35.350> about<00:01:35.590> how<00:01:35.860> to<00:01:35.920> find<00:01:36.189> this<00:01:36.340> what<00:01:36.549> to<00:01:36.640> do

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
time about how to find this what to do

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.940 
time about how to find this what to do
with<00:01:36.939> it<00:01:36.970> and<00:01:37.360> things<00:01:37.930> like<00:01:38.020> that<00:01:38.110> man<00:01:38.439> I<00:01:38.650> spent

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
with it and things like that man I spent

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.710 
with it and things like that man I spent
so<00:01:39.130> much<00:01:39.280> time<00:01:39.340> trying<00:01:39.850> to<00:01:40.299> figure<00:01:40.390> out<00:01:40.540> what

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
so much time trying to figure out what

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.719 
so much time trying to figure out what
the<00:01:40.810> fuck<00:01:40.990> it<00:01:41.110> did<00:01:41.260> ok<00:01:41.650> so<00:01:42.310> this<00:01:42.460> is<00:01:42.640> the

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
the fuck it did ok so this is the

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.760 
the fuck it did ok so this is the
Vanguard<00:01:43.180> quartermaster<00:01:44.049> now<00:01:44.200> if<00:01:44.320> you<00:01:44.439> open

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
Vanguard quartermaster now if you open

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.070 
Vanguard quartermaster now if you open
this<00:01:44.799> up<00:01:44.950> look<00:01:45.909> at<00:01:46.060> them<00:01:46.240> those<00:01:46.630> first<00:01:46.900> few

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
this up look at them those first few

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.170 
this up look at them those first few
things<00:01:47.320> or<00:01:47.530> no<00:01:47.710> their<00:01:48.009> armory<00:01:48.369> so<00:01:48.700> you<00:01:48.759> go<00:01:49.119> to

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
things or no their armory so you go to

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.630 
things or no their armory so you go to
the<00:01:49.270> material<00:01:49.780> exchange<00:01:50.229> the<00:01:51.159> other<00:01:51.310> ones<00:01:51.549> you

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
the material exchange the other ones you

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.270 
the material exchange the other ones you
see<00:01:51.939> do<00:01:52.479> not<00:01:52.810> have<00:01:53.140> anything<00:01:53.500> to<00:01:53.770> do<00:01:53.890> a<00:01:53.920> spin

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
see do not have anything to do a spin

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.219 
see do not have anything to do a spin
metal<00:01:54.580> so<00:01:54.970> we're<00:01:55.299> going<00:01:55.540> to<00:01:55.630> go<00:01:55.659> back<00:01:55.900> down<00:01:56.080> to

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
metal so we're going to go back down to

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.710 
metal so we're going to go back down to
the<00:01:56.259> material<00:01:56.799> exchange<00:01:57.369> I<00:01:57.640> like<00:01:58.270> that<00:01:58.479> but

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
the material exchange I like that but

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.270 
the material exchange I like that but
notice<00:01:58.960> there's<00:01:59.140> more<00:01:59.500> and<00:01:59.740> you<00:01:59.890> need<00:02:00.040> you

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
notice there's more and you need you

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.350 
notice there's more and you need you
need<00:02:00.400> about<00:02:00.549> 50<00:02:00.939> in<00:02:01.030> order<00:02:01.270> to<00:02:01.390> do<00:02:01.540> this<00:02:01.720> now

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
need about 50 in order to do this now

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.030 
need about 50 in order to do this now
yeah<00:02:04.360> ok<00:02:04.780> so<00:02:05.049> right<00:02:05.380> here<00:02:05.530> I<00:02:05.560> only<00:02:05.710> up<00:02:05.860> three

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
yeah ok so right here I only up three

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.100 
yeah ok so right here I only up three

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
they are you can get spin metal once

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.680 
they are you can get spin metal once
again<00:02:11.620> at<00:02:11.799> old<00:02:12.010> Russia<00:02:12.340> which<00:02:12.730> is<00:02:12.849> on<00:02:13.060> earth<00:02:13.360> so

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
again at old Russia which is on earth so

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:14.490 
again at old Russia which is on earth so
you<00:02:13.750> have<00:02:13.900> to<00:02:13.989> make<00:02:14.110> sure<00:02:14.170> that<00:02:14.410> you're

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
you have to make sure that you're

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.800 
you have to make sure that you're
looking<00:02:14.590> around<00:02:14.830> for<00:02:15.069> it<00:02:15.160> there

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
looking around for it there

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.270 
looking around for it there
just<00:02:16.290> keep<00:02:16.470> an<00:02:16.560> eye<00:02:16.680> out<00:02:16.709> for<00:02:16.860> it<00:02:17.040> when<00:02:17.190> you're

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
just keep an eye out for it when you're

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.470

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
one's spirit bloom the other one is

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.360 
one's spirit bloom the other one is
helium<00:02:31.830> filaments<00:02:32.489> and<00:02:32.550> relic<00:02:33.060> iron<00:02:33.330> now<00:02:33.900> I

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
helium filaments and relic iron now I

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.220 
helium filaments and relic iron now I
haven't<00:02:35.370> gotten<00:02:35.819> the<00:02:36.000> other<00:02:36.150> ones<00:02:36.330> yet<00:02:36.540> but

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
haven't gotten the other ones yet but

haven't gotten the other ones yet but
you<00:02:37.470> can<00:02:37.500> find<00:02:38.040> relics<00:02:38.700> iron<00:02:38.970> on<00:02:39.420> Mars<00:02:40.140> when

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
you can find relics iron on Mars when

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.910 
you can find relics iron on Mars when
you<00:02:40.650> unlock<00:02:41.010> that<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:42.269> helium<00:02:42.750> filaments<00:02:43.319> can

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
you unlock that the helium filaments can

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.300 
you unlock that the helium filaments can
be<00:02:44.040> found<00:02:44.250> on<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:45.000> moon<00:02:45.150> and<00:02:45.870> spirit<00:02:46.739> loom<00:02:46.950> can

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
be found on the moon and spirit loom can

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.250 
be found on the moon and spirit loom can
be<00:02:47.400> found<00:02:47.519> on<00:02:47.730> Venus<00:02:48.090> now<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:48.690> only<00:02:48.840> ones<00:02:49.080> i

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
be found on Venus now the only ones i

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.530 
be found on Venus now the only ones i
found<00:02:49.560> some<00:02:49.799> for<00:02:50.130> our<00:02:50.400> spin<00:02:50.700> metal<00:02:51.000> so<00:02:51.360> we're

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
found some for our spin metal so we're

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.580 
found some for our spin metal so we're
going<00:02:51.600> to<00:02:51.720> go<00:02:51.750> ahead<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:51.989> go<00:02:52.140> to<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.319> second

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
going to go ahead and go to the second

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.500 
going to go ahead and go to the second
place<00:02:52.709> that<00:02:52.860> you<00:02:52.920> can<00:02:53.069> take<00:02:53.220> this<00:02:53.430> and<00:02:53.670> that<00:02:54.330> is

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
place that you can take this and that is

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.050 
place that you can take this and that is
the<00:02:54.690> crucible<00:02:55.069> quartermaster<00:02:56.069> now<00:02:56.850> once

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
the crucible quartermaster now once

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.870 
the crucible quartermaster now once
again<00:02:57.209> you<00:02:57.510> will<00:02:57.600> see<00:02:57.660> that<00:02:58.350> you<00:02:59.250> see<00:02:59.400> I'm<00:02:59.549> so

faults right there you go down that main

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.759 
faults right there you go down that main
little<00:03:06.330> hallway<00:03:06.569> dungeon<00:03:07.170> thing<00:03:07.440> and<00:03:07.680> you're

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
little hallway dungeon thing and you're

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.449 
little hallway dungeon thing and you're
there<00:03:08.010> you<00:03:08.160> are<00:03:08.360> but<00:03:09.360> yeah<00:03:10.230> so<00:03:11.040> you<00:03:11.190> can<00:03:11.370> get
