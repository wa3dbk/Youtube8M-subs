boutiques I where vr 920 now I just

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.970 
boutiques I where vr 920 now I just
grabbed<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:08.670> Box<00:00:09.120> he<00:00:10.050> probably<00:00:10.469> can't<00:00:10.740> said

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
grabbed the Box he probably can't said

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.169 
grabbed the Box he probably can't said
in<00:00:11.070> a<00:00:11.160> little<00:00:11.309> bit<00:00:11.460> remb<00:00:11.639> interesting<00:00:12.059> but

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
in a little bit remb interesting but

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.580 
in a little bit remb interesting but
it's<00:00:12.780> basically<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:14.570> wrapper<00:00:15.570> around<00:00:15.719> hits<00:00:16.410> it

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
it's basically a wrapper around hits it

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.779 
it's basically a wrapper around hits it
used<00:00:16.920> for<00:00:17.130> gaming<00:00:17.670> or<00:00:17.760> watching<00:00:17.820> TV<00:00:19.189> it<00:00:20.189> states

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
used for gaming or watching TV it states

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.759 
used for gaming or watching TV it states
about<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.390> equivalent<00:00:21.810> looking<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.140> 62<00:00:22.619> inch

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
about the equivalent looking to 62 inch

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.650 
about the equivalent looking to 62 inch
monitor<00:00:23.160> now<00:00:23.279> I<00:00:23.310> put<00:00:23.550> it<00:00:23.670> on<00:00:23.760> here<00:00:24.029> but<00:00:24.330> it's<00:00:24.480> up

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
monitor now I put it on here but it's up

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.620 
monitor now I put it on here but it's up
to<00:00:24.689> walk<00:00:25.289> in<00:00:25.439> second<00:00:25.800> life<00:00:25.920> now<00:00:26.300> I've<00:00:27.300> got<00:00:27.539> it

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
to walk in second life now I've got it

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.679 
to walk in second life now I've got it
running<00:00:27.990> on<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.260> map<00:00:28.980> which<00:00:29.849> shouldn't<00:00:30.269> usually

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
running on a map which shouldn't usually

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.229 
running on a map which shouldn't usually
be<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.900> problem<00:00:31.230> but<00:00:31.590> what<00:00:32.489> I've<00:00:32.640> discovered

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
be a problem but what I've discovered

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.900 
be a problem but what I've discovered
since<00:00:33.510> buying<00:00:33.840> this<00:00:34.530> was<00:00:35.340> two<00:00:35.640> or<00:00:35.760> four

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
since buying this was two or four

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:36.979 
since buying this was two or four
hundred<00:00:36.210> dollars<00:00:36.239> or<00:00:36.570> something<00:00:36.840> like<00:00:36.930> that

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
hundred dollars or something like that

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.010 
hundred dollars or something like that
yeah<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:38.370> is<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.180> mac<00:00:39.480> drivers<00:00:39.690> are

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
yeah it is that the mac drivers are

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.170 
yeah it is that the mac drivers are
particularly<00:00:40.410> great<00:00:40.680> for<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.820> if<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:41.940> consume

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
particularly great for so if you consume

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.350 
particularly great for so if you consume
the<00:00:42.360> screen<00:00:42.629> now<00:00:42.780> I<00:00:42.840> can<00:00:43.640> click<00:00:44.640> across<00:00:45.059> there

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
the screen now I can click across there

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.729 
the screen now I can click across there
probably<00:00:45.629> pop<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.079> monkey<00:00:46.260> on<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.590> right

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
probably pop of a monkey on the right

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.910 
probably pop of a monkey on the right
screen<00:00:48.230> so<00:00:49.230> as<00:00:49.590> I'm<00:00:49.950> moving<00:00:50.100> around<00:00:51.920> nothing

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
screen so as I'm moving around nothing

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.920 
screen so as I'm moving around nothing
really<00:00:53.250> exciting<00:00:53.610> there<00:00:54.030> anything<00:00:54.360> with<00:00:54.809> the

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
really exciting there anything with the

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.750 
really exciting there anything with the
headset<00:00:55.350> here<00:00:55.590> I'm<00:00:56.010> actually<00:00:56.190> singing<00:00:56.579> them

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
headset here I'm actually singing them

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.260 
headset here I'm actually singing them
wrap<00:00:56.910> around<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.480> it's<00:00:58.020> not<00:00:58.410> all<00:00:59.280> around<00:00:59.940> me

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
wrap around so it's not all around me

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.110 
wrap around so it's not all around me
but<00:01:00.570> it's<00:01:01.260> huge<00:01:01.590> in<00:01:01.800> front<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.100> me<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.670> I

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
but it's huge in front of me and I

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.579 
but it's huge in front of me and I
switched<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.690> mouse<00:01:03.930> or<00:01:04.140> gets<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.470> little

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
switched to the mouse or gets a little

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.230 
switched to the mouse or gets a little
bit<00:01:04.799> strange<00:01:05.220> because<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.610> sort<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.880> got<00:01:06.180> a

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
bit strange because you sort of got a

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.850 
bit strange because you sort of got a
tip<00:01:06.540> your<00:01:06.720> head<00:01:06.810> up<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.080> it's<00:01:07.229> not<00:01:07.409> so<00:01:07.619> switch

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
tip your head up and it's not so switch

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.700 
tip your head up and it's not so switch
to<00:01:07.890> mouse<00:01:08.220> lot<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:09.390> in<00:01:09.570> theory<00:01:09.840> what<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.439> how

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
to mouse lot so in theory what the how

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.990 
to mouse lot so in theory what the how
these<00:01:10.920> had<00:01:11.130> actually<00:01:11.400> work<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:11.760> I'd<00:01:11.880> be

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
these had actually work is I'd be

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.340 
these had actually work is I'd be
looking<00:01:12.150> at<00:01:12.420> where<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.540> went<00:01:12.659> like<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:13.110> or

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
looking at where I went like that or

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.460 
looking at where I went like that or
like<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:14.630> the<00:01:15.630> scoring<00:01:15.930> would<00:01:16.170> actually

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
like that the scoring would actually

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.260 
like that the scoring would actually
move<00:01:16.590> me<00:01:16.830> little<00:01:17.070> duck<00:01:17.310> as<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:17.909> can<00:01:18.030> see<00:01:18.240> I

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
move me little duck as you can see I

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.880 
move me little duck as you can see I
haven't<00:01:18.780> managed<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.200> get<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.530> work<00:01:19.619> hit

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
haven't managed to get it to work hit

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.160 
haven't managed to get it to work hit
and<00:01:20.040> I'm<00:01:20.130> going<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.310> contact<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.880> company

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
and I'm going to contact the company

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.249 
and I'm going to contact the company
I'll<00:01:22.170> do<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.470> manually<00:01:23.030> so<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.060> go<00:01:24.330> in<00:01:24.659> brain

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
I'll do it manually so I go in brain

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.880 
I'll do it manually so I go in brain
theory<00:01:25.590> aren't<00:01:25.920> like<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:27.530> that's<00:01:28.530> how<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.770> in

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
theory aren't like that that's how it in

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.469 
theory aren't like that that's how it in
theory<00:01:29.189> should<00:01:29.280> look<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.939> would<00:01:30.060> work<00:01:30.240> that

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
theory should look it would work that

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.060 
theory should look it would work that
way<00:01:30.659> on<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:30.900> Windows<00:01:31.259> machine<00:01:31.290> any<00:01:31.829> like

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
way on a Windows machine any like

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.499 
way on a Windows machine any like
they've<00:01:32.579> actually<00:01:32.759> got<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.119> drivers

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
they've actually got the drivers

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.380 
they've actually got the drivers
provided<00:01:33.960> on<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.140> disk<00:01:34.729> so<00:01:35.729> that's<00:01:35.909> how<00:01:36.180> I'm

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
provided on the disk so that's how I'm

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.210 
provided on the disk so that's how I'm
theory<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.930> would<00:01:37.049> work<00:01:37.259> um<00:01:38.780> all<00:01:39.780> in<00:01:40.020> or<00:01:40.220> couple

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
theory it would work um all in or couple

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.100 
theory it would work um all in or couple
people<00:01:41.460> said<00:01:41.640> said<00:01:41.880> it's<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.119> actual<00:01:42.540> truth<00:01:42.840> of

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
people said said it's a actual truth of

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.840 
people said said it's a actual truth of
the<00:01:43.290> Arsenal<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.100> it's<00:01:44.280> not<00:01:44.399> perfect

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
the Arsenal is it's not perfect

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.060 
the Arsenal is it's not perfect
like<00:01:44.970> um<00:01:45.329> where<00:01:46.140> I'm<00:01:46.259> sitting<00:01:46.590> here<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:46.920> can

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
like um where I'm sitting here I can

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.460 
like um where I'm sitting here I can
actually<00:01:47.220> see<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:48.210> laptop<00:01:48.960> monitor<00:01:49.140> out<00:01:49.380> of

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
actually see the laptop monitor out of
