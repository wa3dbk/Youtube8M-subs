00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470 
are you get with motion and movement

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.650 
are you get with motion and movement
because<00:01:00.220> that<00:01:00.400> brings<00:01:00.670> the<00:01:00.850> D<00:01:01.150> out<00:01:01.420> of<00:01:01.570> the

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
because that brings the D out of the

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.020 
because that brings the D out of the
areas<00:01:02.050> that<00:01:02.079> they<00:01:02.320> want<00:01:02.589> to<00:01:02.710> be<00:01:02.829> in

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
sometimes we make mistakes

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.360

and this becomes all of a sudden a
momentum<00:01:23.960> builder<00:01:23.990> now

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170
