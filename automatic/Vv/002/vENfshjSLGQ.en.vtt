00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:05.809
 is undoubtedly the best first time 

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:09.620
 of local mexico of the tournament although 

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:11.629
 principle was defensive and this was the 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.790
 first where what gave us sample of 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:15.620
 his speed where toño Rodríguez 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.690
 he stopped very well and then mexico started 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.090
 with walls actions exits 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.560
 Attraction movements generating 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.090
 spaces and this was one of the cities 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.530
 interventions that the goalkeeper has 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.780
 Dutch that was undoubtedly a factor for 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.880
 that holland go up on the scoreboard and 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:32.770
 the truth is impressive here 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.770
 how is Dárvin carried in the crossing 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:41.570
 however, the ball stays there and goes down 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.070
 at number 8 it arrives and affirms its 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.590
 quality when putting this goal yes 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.300
 Mier reject unfortunate that 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.840
 crosses very well and then another move of 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.390
 of the goalie plus a wall that made 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.800
 very well and jiménez and marked fabian and that 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.750
 shrinks very much in space but maicon 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.100
 I kept insisting looking at that 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.870
 moment of goal of the draw with that guy 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.480
 of plays until the goal came 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:06.170
 Herrera an excellent wall that has 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.070
 and also the goalkeeper 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.540
 and the whole team does it very well 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.730
 mexican recovery of the ball 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.659
 by cha with the very good wall 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:17.549
 with alonso with the goal of america at eleven 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.130
 to the jiménez and then the very good 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.320
 also ignoring 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.119
 and then quickly holland too 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.799
 with a wall we're talking about 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.710
 at this moment the Mexican area enters 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:30.140
 they cross they see rebound it stays there to 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.179
 get down on the ball and get it 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.520
 in your arm to go to isr markers 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:36.079
 because mexico insisted he went to the front and 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.789
 the goalkeeper was still the factor if 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.350
 marsman very well the goalkeeper looks that 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:41.390
 It has much craft and very good 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.729
 goalkeeper and then Mexico was trying 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.979
 by far shots that also hurt 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.890
 and again the goalkeeper was placed in 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.119
 very good position and mexico closed the 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.590
 first time with this play a 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.380
 excellent was individual he marked fabian 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.970
 the shot to the crossbar so if not 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.439
 We analyzed Mexico could have been in 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.600
 the marker and unfortunately going to 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.750
 talk 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.180
 you have to follow here is here does not come 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.820
 the doctor is blue see how the 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.670
 ball looks candid ramirez the santista 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:13.620
 does the person to the player of ramírez 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.620
 golazo golazo 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.370
 frost played 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.519
 what a great goal of each tool that 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.610
 future has been shown to like 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:34.500
 face that you want to win versus not 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.290
 he cares if he has one or two in front 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.790
 and here to see the tunnel play comes in 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.700
 perfectly fine is can definition 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.530
 biting the ball really ramirez that 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.150
 I had not had as much participation in 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.790
 the first time in this second time 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.620
 I already had several goal options 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.420
 coming to and from background and good the 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.849
 definition of this goal is what is it 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.459
 that represent what has been good with 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.290
 this superior party and this moment 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.370
 what this tie even falls short 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.250
 so we've seen the team 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.670
 Mexican totally agree what 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.610
 arturo brizio of saints of the 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.140
 comarca lagunera the champion team of 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.599
 Mexican football comes the team of 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.989
 mexico here is jiménez little for 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:14.989
 lying 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:32.190
 is in a great play with candid 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:34.290
 ramirez and I deservedly need him already 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.360
 he turned the marker that level 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.580
 behind 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.710
 football is sometimes fair and in this 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.120
 occasion what does justice what 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.910
 had done in Mexico again the 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:47.510
 excellent driving of regimes after 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.220
 that have gone to ramírez with all vision 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.470
 he realizes that he is left alone he does not look for the 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.880
 shot and enables perfectly well to 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.040
 jiménez that later defines with a 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.360
 poke it up really mexico 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.860
 dominant dominating the whole party is 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.420
 another 15 minutes being superior 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.540
 totally to the Dutch team that does not see 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.370
 where to balance the actions and 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.350
 mexico really doing to see without 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.160
 justice what what has represented 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.160
 this game 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.310
 alan polished in the touch for herrera 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:23.159
 as with sweets contrarily centers 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.159
 for good
