00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.350
 it takes its utility how many of 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:20.230
 we have not bought games anymore 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.000
 used maybe we bought by the 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.630
 economy really because we get more 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.369
 cheap to buy used games that 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.590
 new because obviously it's not the most 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.600
 expensive good that's for all those 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.670
 that we look for the economy or that of some 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.489
 way we earn our own little money and 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.890
 Well, we take care of it for you who are 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.899
 juniors sons of daddy mom does not matter 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.659
 make them wear when falling or the cause is 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:45.819
 your money not very well then here 

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:48.339
 let's restart the pokÃ©mon game 

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:50.739
 pearl believe me for all these 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:53.589
 games is exactly the same 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.450
 procedure ok then first then 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:59.250
 let's choose I do not put a pum pum 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.170
 and all 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:06.120
 So this is what they say there 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.790
 it's a rum there is a girl money he sees it 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.520
 I am money, I only see it, so what 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.800
 I have it because I deserve it very 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.140
 alright then the pearl pokemon can 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.390
 see him 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:22.110
 ok then the procedure then 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.500
 it really is not that difficult is a 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.810
 sequence of movements look here and 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.119
 this is a game of a show that not me 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.840
 I do not know very well then it is 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.030
 we simply press the select though 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.030
 there is already the select plus the button 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.310
 up here you can see and the button sees 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.690
 all this at the same time to see if it 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.300
 manage to appreciate here 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.540
 the list returns us and we are going to press it 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:53.900
 all at the same time and there it is going to 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:56.810
 say that if we want to erase all the 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.780
 data saved from the previous item 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:04.250
 we are going to obviously give that yes and 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:07.060
 he says he 's erasing that this is no longer 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.830
 will be able to recover then the game 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.720
 you really want to delete it obviously 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.840
 Well, if you fuck for that, we come here 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:18.560
 and osa day of erasing all 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.800
 data do not turn off the console very well 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:26.360
 then I repeat is this key the 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:31.760
 up the select button and he sees everything 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:34.130
 at the same time ok and with that is why 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.070
 I tell them if you have a 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:40.550
 game that they no longer want to play or 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:43.100
 buy a game with a game this is 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:46.520
 for almost all PokÃ©mon games is 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:49.190
 the same sequence of buttons can be 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.680
 delayed if it can be delayed depending 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.670
 of the 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:56.189
 of each game's own game 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.680
 This was already somewhat advanced and therefore 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:01.409
 that's why it 's taking a little longer 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.129
 of time but I'm going to do it the way 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:08.430
 real in real time for you to see 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:11.700
 how long is it taking then well this does not 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:15.269
 it takes a lot that is maybe a minute it 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.120
 completely returns everything again and 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.380
 we go 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:23.950
 pearl pokemon 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.700
 and let's see what is already with the option 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:33.739
 of 1 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:36.860
 because new pokÃ©mon game is like a 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:39.620
 completely virgin game 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.610
 then that would be all for today that 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.700
 the people 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:47.090
 I hope you have served this video 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:50.920
 to restart your games is just 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:56.000
 only a mini guide very, very, very 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:58.310
 small then, I'll let you wait 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.600
 that they do very well in everything in everything 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:05.200
 what do we see each other in the next 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.200
 bye
