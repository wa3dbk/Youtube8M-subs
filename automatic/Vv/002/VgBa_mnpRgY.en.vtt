00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:05.520
 so well our 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.420
 marked fossa how is it to 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.570
 positions 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.210
 how is such an easy task 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.389
 as a ransom stupidly take and dig a hole 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.720
 still however there are some little things too 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.789
 who need to know means first thing 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.859
 most convenient to dig a hole flat 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.320
 shovel well pointy our she would 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:30.840
 the flat bottom of the spade should be 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:33.600
 flat not behind they keenly i am you now 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.050
 I'll show you why because when we dig 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.750
 dug up but it deepened for example 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.020
 then take and since bucket excavator 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.390
 again abut the edge of the turf is cut and 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.879
 here so here it is like their warehouse well you 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.030
 itâ€™s easy to choose bran 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.020
 made a hole listening they are very comfortable and 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:58.590
 just the same on the other hand 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:03.960
 about and prune and below fossa at us 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:06.720
 it turns out exactly goes as expected 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.240
 if we are sharp of course here wear 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.430
 using you can pick and drop 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.400
 there the ashes of a kid when it comes it 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.729
 a ruby hey have the same Kolupaev 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.740
 will become a sharp putting shovel becomes 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.030
 on your knees to choose with your hands because 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.159
 will come out from there will be almost 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.250
 it is impossible for them to continue to show the bottom 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.619
 there is a tag on a shovel that is 70 centimeters 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.759
 this is such a depth we should have 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:37.979
 scheme under the table reinforced concrete well and 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:40.140
 drip let's approach this way so 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.180
 convenient we did not try on his sharp 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.180
 shovel to do this thing 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:52.710
 however, I had to abandon the simple 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.799
 such wedge-shaped shovels 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.679
 bayonet and go things on a flat 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.740
 everywhere and immediately it went three times 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:04.439
 faster and most importantly that no one 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.530
 skimping on the body climb 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:11.730
 behind the head in this hole and take out 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.610
 well, there is nothing up there yet 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:20.010
 no hard 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:22.500
 bury and pipe her very flat 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:28.560
 shovel very well trim a gardener 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:29.010
 evenly undercut this world at all 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.720
 parties 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:35.690
 like breaking off stupid excavator and here 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:41.879
 you can see that the pieces right 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:46.500
 that but chipping straight rock pieces is not 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:51.720
 In this way, we go deep into Davy 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:59.420
 then he knocked it up once broke it all 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:59.420
 business and buried just this breed 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.890
 here is some 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:09.210
 our loam is very hard as asphalt 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.010
 but underneath it then later on when we 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:15.030
 we pass this place when we pass it 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.560
 You can see the place in this hole next 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.560
 there is already soft sand 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.950
 come on, yes that's not a minus 20 centimeters 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.900
 very dense and sharp shovel she 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.450
 a reason to dig deeper sense hour 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:33.930
 there was no stronghold potihu quietly 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:36.060
 you're hiding here she cuts like a ladle 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.070
 just fine like a knife just two and 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.540
 get out 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:44.430
 along the wall well and already went to business 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:47.190
 the sand will go on easier and take out 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:50.220
 such a flat shovel is much easier to lie 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:53.209
 sean how then do we remove the wall 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:56.730
 He made a wall and did not get enough sleep and 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:04:00.110
 island around the edges she would have until you million 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.110
 all around the edges would crumble 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:10.530
 trick small easy flat shovel 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:13.890
 him a cow 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:17.370
 leaves at the bottom it turns out exactly the same 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:19.880
 which is important for the future pillars for 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.880
 fence 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:28.450
 so made your way well you little yellow 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:32.620
 sand here he softer now get hold of 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:37.600
 prison on nutrition will monolith you 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:40.810
 concrete practical concrete so you 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:46.480
 Reached us there is no label to Nudina 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:47.710
 here she almost became 5 centimeters this 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.970
 we leave for what 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:54.550
 5 cm so that our first sections are 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.830
 were above ground and what will be lower 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:02.820
 then more concrete will be hammered between the pillars 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:06.880
 and that is what he said as there 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:08.860
 between take out the soil that's trim here 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:12.780
 so in this way and imitate easily 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:16.380
 good too flat shovel here 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:19.270
 trimmed for the first time May so take 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.110
 the vibration is small and these are the ground 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.120
 stayed easy 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:26.680
 in the morning was to pull almost everything 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.520
 woke up wedge like this 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:32.320
 way to soul 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:35.070
 not standing on all fours with virtually no 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.990
 special effort and effort of course there is 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:40.600
 generally not going anywhere 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:44.560
 however much easier so flat 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:50.440
 shovel apply your power more 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:56.280
 economical they are spent well here it is 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:56.280
 something that I wanted to share explain
