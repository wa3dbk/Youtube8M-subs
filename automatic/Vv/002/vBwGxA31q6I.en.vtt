looked at but the main things for me
there's<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.730> couple<00:02:12.000> points<00:02:13.130> one<00:02:14.130> of<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.280> main

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
there's a couple points one of the main

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.420 
there's a couple points one of the main
points<00:02:14.700> is<00:02:14.790> you<00:02:15.060> always<00:02:15.300> see<00:02:15.720> how<00:02:16.019> they<00:02:17.010> attack

actually see you'll always see how they

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.699 
actually see you'll always see how they
attack<00:02:21.209> wide<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:21.720> that's<00:02:21.959> really<00:02:22.200> important

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
attack wide and that's really important

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.100 
attack wide and that's really important
in<00:02:23.160> futsal<00:02:23.580> obviously<00:02:24.510> if<00:02:24.600> you're<00:02:24.690> attacking

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
in futsal obviously if you're attacking

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.540 
in futsal obviously if you're attacking
why'd<00:02:25.260> you<00:02:25.709> stretch<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.160> cord<00:02:26.370> out<00:02:26.430> the

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
why'd you stretch the cord out the

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.160 
why'd you stretch the cord out the
courts<00:02:26.760> already<00:02:26.880> small<00:02:27.180> enough<00:02:27.360> as<00:02:27.510> it<00:02:27.630> is<00:02:27.690> so

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
courts already small enough as it is so

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.660 
courts already small enough as it is so
you<00:02:28.230> need<00:02:28.410> to<00:02:28.500> maintain<00:02:28.620> that<00:02:29.069> that<00:02:29.340> sort<00:02:29.519> of

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
you need to maintain that that sort of

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.059 
you need to maintain that that sort of
wide<00:02:29.880> play<00:02:30.209> and<00:02:31.170> that<00:02:31.260> something<00:02:31.620> kids<00:02:31.860> will

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
wide play and that something kids will

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.500 
wide play and that something kids will
learn<00:02:32.250> not<00:02:32.880> something<00:02:33.150> you<00:02:33.239> can<00:02:33.269> definitely

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
learn not something you can definitely

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.490 
learn not something you can definitely
teach<00:02:33.959> older<00:02:34.560> teams<00:02:34.830> as<00:02:35.069> well<00:02:35.300> the<00:02:36.319> sort<00:02:37.319> of

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
teach older teams as well the sort of

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.460 
teach older teams as well the sort of
the<00:02:38.100> antithesis<00:02:38.910> of<00:02:39.269> that<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:40.019> opposite

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
the antithesis of that the the opposite

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.220 
the antithesis of that the the opposite
example<00:02:40.890> is<00:02:41.070> the<00:02:41.970> play<00:02:42.239> that<00:02:42.269> showed<00:02:42.900> when

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
example is the play that showed when

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.569 
example is the play that showed when
Schumacher<00:02:43.769> tried<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.130> go<00:02:44.220> right<00:02:44.340> through<00:02:44.519> the

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
Schumacher tried to go right through the

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.039 
Schumacher tried to go right through the
middle<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:44.940> he<00:02:45.030> basically<00:02:45.329> was<00:02:45.600> mauled<00:02:45.870> by

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
middle and he basically was mauled by

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.199 
middle and he basically was mauled by
four<00:02:46.290> defenders<00:02:46.680> if<00:02:46.860> you<00:02:47.459> if<00:02:47.640> you<00:02:47.790> keep<00:02:48.060> your

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
four defenders if you if you keep your

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.789 
four defenders if you if you keep your
team's<00:02:48.420> out<00:02:48.630> wide<00:02:48.959> that<00:02:49.440> will<00:02:49.590> definitely

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
team's out wide that will definitely

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.069 
team's out wide that will definitely
help<00:02:50.010> in<00:02:50.250> your<00:02:50.280> positioning<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.750> that<00:02:51.930> will

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
help in your positioning and that will

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:53.449 
help in your positioning and that will
help<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.350> keep<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.530> defense<00:02:53.010> a<00:02:53.100> little<00:02:53.220> more

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
help to keep the defense a little more

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:54.979 
help to keep the defense a little more
honest<00:02:53.790> if<00:02:53.940> not<00:02:54.090> they<00:02:54.239> can<00:02:54.299> just<00:02:54.570> pack<00:02:54.720> it<00:02:54.750> in

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
honest if not they can just pack it in

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.360 
honest if not they can just pack it in
the<00:02:55.110> middle<00:02:55.350> and<00:02:55.530> you<00:02:55.799> might<00:02:55.950> have<00:02:56.100> trouble

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
the middle and you might have trouble

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.970 
the middle and you might have trouble
getting<00:02:57.239> good<00:02:57.600> shots<00:02:57.630> on<00:02:57.989> goal<00:02:58.019> much<00:02:58.709> like<00:02:58.920> in

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
getting good shots on goal much like in

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.560 
getting good shots on goal much like in
hockey<00:02:59.190> when<00:02:59.489> defenders<00:03:00.030> pack<00:03:00.269> it<00:03:00.420> in<00:03:00.510> the

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
hockey when defenders pack it in the

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:01.910 
hockey when defenders pack it in the
middle<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:00.959> you<00:03:01.140> really<00:03:01.350> can't<00:03:01.560> get<00:03:01.650> a<00:03:01.709> clear

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
middle and you really can't get a clear

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.620 
middle and you really can't get a clear
shot<00:03:01.950> on<00:03:02.280> goal<00:03:02.430> if<00:03:02.670> you<00:03:02.940> keep<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.239> defenders

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
shot on goal if you keep the defenders

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.810 
shot on goal if you keep the defenders
spread<00:03:03.959> and<00:03:04.260> honest<00:03:04.799> you<00:03:05.190> can<00:03:05.310> make<00:03:05.459> runs

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
spread and honest you can make runs

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.030 
spread and honest you can make runs
through<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.150> middle<00:03:06.180> and<00:03:06.620> sort<00:03:07.620> of<00:03:07.680> open<00:03:08.010> that

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
through the middle and sort of open that

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.770 
through the middle and sort of open that
up<00:03:08.340> or<00:03:08.549> you<00:03:08.970> can<00:03:09.120> make<00:03:09.239> the<00:03:09.359> over-the-top

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
up or you can make the over-the-top

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.449 
up or you can make the over-the-top
balls<00:03:10.170> or<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.560> kind<00:03:10.859> of<00:03:10.950> little<00:03:11.160> diagonal

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
balls or the kind of little diagonal

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.640 
balls or the kind of little diagonal
balls<00:03:11.790> like<00:03:12.750> boomerang<00:03:13.200> did<00:03:13.410> when<00:03:13.560> they

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
balls like boomerang did when they

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.430 
balls like boomerang did when they
scored<00:03:13.980> their<00:03:14.160> their<00:03:14.519> first<00:03:14.730> goal<00:03:15.290> the<00:03:16.290> other

scored their their first goal the other

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.470 
scored their their first goal the other
thing<00:03:16.680> to<00:03:16.920> to<00:03:17.040> really<00:03:17.160> notice<00:03:17.370> is<00:03:17.640> how<00:03:18.329> much

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
thing to to really notice is how much

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.720 
thing to to really notice is how much
the<00:03:18.630> goalkeepers<00:03:19.140> are<00:03:19.230> involved<00:03:19.680> you<00:03:20.400> notice

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
the goalkeepers are involved you notice

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.479 
the goalkeepers are involved you notice
goalkeepers<00:03:21.769> coming<00:03:22.769> up<00:03:22.859> and<00:03:23.010> playing<00:03:23.250> in<00:03:23.400> the

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
goalkeepers coming up and playing in the

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.970 
goalkeepers coming up and playing in the
play<00:03:23.700> you<00:03:24.060> noticed<00:03:24.450> once<00:03:24.989> or<00:03:25.170> twice<00:03:25.290> when<00:03:25.560> they

that's kind of a part of the game but
something<00:03:40.829> you<00:03:40.950> really<00:03:41.160> need<00:03:41.190> to<00:03:41.310> be

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
something you really need to be

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
and he can be another attacker and be a

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.589 
and he can be another attacker and be a
very<00:03:45.629> strong<00:03:46.620> force<00:03:47.069> in<00:03:47.250> your<00:03:47.370> club<00:03:47.610> in<00:03:48.450> your

team
but<00:03:49.860> he<00:03:49.920> needs<00:03:50.130> to<00:03:50.220> also<00:03:50.400> play<00:03:51.300> it<00:03:51.510> with<00:03:51.660> sort

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
but he needs to also play it with sort

but he needs to also play it with sort
of<00:03:51.959> caution<00:03:52.470> you<00:03:52.680> know<00:03:52.800> you<00:03:53.400> can't<00:03:53.640> get<00:03:53.790> burned

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
did for interview he got back extremely

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.680 
did for interview he got back extremely
fast<00:04:32.040> it<00:04:32.310> was<00:04:32.400> able<00:04:32.669> to<00:04:32.790> cover<00:04:33.000> so<00:04:33.450> that<00:04:33.480> the

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
fast it was able to cover so that the

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.330 
fast it was able to cover so that the
first<00:04:33.900> defender<00:04:34.350> could<00:04:34.530> step<00:04:34.770> up<00:04:34.890> and<00:04:35.100> delay

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
first defender could step up and delay

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.050 
first defender could step up and delay
then<00:04:35.850> he<00:04:36.030> was<00:04:36.150> able<00:04:36.270> to<00:04:36.480> cover<00:04:36.770> behind<00:04:37.770> him<00:04:38.669> so

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
then he was able to cover behind him so

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.960 
then he was able to cover behind him so
just<00:04:39.720> like<00:04:39.870> you<00:04:39.900> would<00:04:40.200> you<00:04:40.919> know<00:04:41.010> tak<00:04:41.400> basics
