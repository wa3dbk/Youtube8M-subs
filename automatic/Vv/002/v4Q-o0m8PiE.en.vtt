00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.650 
other ideas he protected all this will
make<00:03:32.620> your<00:03:32.769> hair<00:03:33.010> and<00:03:33.250> not<00:03:33.730> frizzy<00:03:34.120> all<00:03:34.450> these

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
make your hair and not frizzy all these

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.030 
make your hair and not frizzy all these
two<00:03:35.560> steps<00:03:36.810> and<00:03:37.810> so<00:03:38.019> I<00:03:38.049> think<00:03:38.230> the<00:03:38.530> kit<00:03:38.769> is<00:03:39.010> just

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
two steps and so I think the kit is just

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.750 
two steps and so I think the kit is just
like<00:03:39.430> a<00:03:39.610> sample<00:03:40.150> run<00:03:40.620> but<00:03:41.620> it<00:03:42.160> definitely<00:03:42.400> got

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
like a sample run but it definitely got

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.170 
like a sample run but it definitely got
me<00:03:42.970> so<00:03:43.239> and<00:03:43.750> I<00:03:43.840> love<00:03:44.140> my<00:03:44.320> straight<00:03:44.530> hair

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
me so and I love my straight hair

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.369 
me so and I love my straight hair
curly-haired<00:03:46.079> so<00:03:46.939> for<00:03:47.939> right<00:03:48.120> now<00:03:48.150> this<00:03:49.079> part

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
curly-haired so for right now this part

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:54.020
