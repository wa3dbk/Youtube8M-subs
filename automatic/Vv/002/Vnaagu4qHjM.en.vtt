00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hey here is norman i want you 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.200
 again a delicious recipe before 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:10.650
 represent mainly targeted 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.200
 Buckwheat I have an hour long 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.470
 soaked and then in for a day 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:20.340
 leave the bowl and then come 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:23.070
 She does it all by herself and I think so 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.960
 really very important to us 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.900
 make dishes as relaxed as possible 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.080
 that's why with all sorts of 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.480
 spice herbs or here for now 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.829
 example flower pollen give a sweet 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.450
 taste or vanilla is one anyway 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.930
 Enjoy it so it's pretty much mine 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.329
 favorite spice or here I still have 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:51.120
 meter powder that he tastes so after 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:56.520
 caramel or stevia it makes everything sweet 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:01:00.660
 or cinnamon 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:08.520
 There is still a certain sharp kick 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:10.619
 and for the fat component 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.070
 we also have a coconut utmost to 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.070
 go 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.439
 so now we have the whole and the 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.009
 tastes awesome so it remembers 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.900
 rather with cookies in the cake dough and it 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.030
 tastes really delicious so 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.070
 I can only recommend it to anyone so much 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:37.860
 to spice up as possible with the 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:39.930
 favorite spices just cereals 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.759
 sprouts taste relatively boring 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.030
 but with spices really tastes 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:49.229
 All well so please use 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.700
 spices say that's not good 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.060
 It just never tastes like it tastes good 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.060
 tried
