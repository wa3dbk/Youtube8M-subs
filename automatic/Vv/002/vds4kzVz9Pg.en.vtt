00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
right it's doing a quick comparison

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.200 
right it's doing a quick comparison
between<00:00:03.210> the<00:00:03.680> center<00:00:04.680> and<00:00:04.710> the<00:00:05.040> ibanez<00:00:05.490> both

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
between the center and the ibanez both

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.250 
between the center and the ibanez both
feel<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:06.690> same<00:00:06.839> job<00:00:08.090> rhythm<00:00:09.090> guitars<00:00:09.570> and

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
feel the same job rhythm guitars and

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.129 
feel the same job rhythm guitars and
with<00:00:10.670> decent<00:00:11.670> high<00:00:11.759> output<00:00:11.969> bridge<00:00:12.690> pickups

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
with decent high output bridge pickups

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.259 
with decent high output bridge pickups
which<00:00:13.380> is<00:00:13.500> what<00:00:13.620> i<00:00:13.650> normally<00:00:13.769> use<00:00:14.070> apes<00:00:14.940> and

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
which is what i normally use apes and

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.800 
which is what i normally use apes and
other<00:00:15.330> time<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:17.330> just<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.390> comparison

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
other time and just a comparison

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.429 
other time and just a comparison

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:01:08.940 

you

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.190 

Oh

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:24.280 

I<00:01:16.039> can't<00:01:17.039> even<00:01:17.159> do<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.060> because<00:01:18.570> it's<00:01:18.840> just

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.499 

it<00:01:25.290> just<00:01:25.470> feels<00:01:25.590> weird<00:01:26.119> maybe<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.240> might<00:01:27.390> be

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
it just feels weird maybe you might be

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.499 
it just feels weird maybe you might be
the<00:01:27.600> strings<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:27.960> my<00:01:28.020> beat<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.470> action

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
the strings of my beat the action

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.990 
the strings of my beat the action
certainly<00:01:30.509> plays<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.720> lot<00:01:30.869> better<00:01:31.110> on<00:01:31.580> the<00:01:32.580> RG

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
certainly plays a lot better on the RG

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.160 
certainly plays a lot better on the RG
quick<00:01:36.000> change<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.299> pickup<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:36.899> it's<00:01:37.080> very

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
quick change of pickup so it's very

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.940 
quick change of pickup so it's very
guitars

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.340 

I<00:01:43.009> love<00:01:43.729> that<00:01:43.850> musics<00:01:44.299> then<00:01:44.479> guitar<00:01:44.990> standing

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
I love that musics then guitar standing

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.719 
I love that musics then guitar standing
rather<00:01:45.759> go<00:01:46.759> in<00:01:46.909> mind<00:01:47.060> this<00:01:47.210> is<00:01:47.270> a<00:01:48.460> indie<00:01:49.460> that

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
rather go in mind this is a indie that

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.490 
rather go in mind this is a indie that
was<00:01:49.880> in<00:01:50.090> D<00:01:50.539> so<00:01:51.310> just<00:01:52.310> account<00:01:52.640> for<00:01:52.880> the

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
was in D so just account for the

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:47.820 
was in D so just account for the
different<00:01:54.500> pitch

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.750 

you

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.810 

all<00:02:51.760> right<00:02:51.880> um<00:02:53.340> surprisingly<00:02:54.340> from<00:02:54.580> mahogany

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
all right um surprisingly from mahogany

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.990 
all right um surprisingly from mahogany
guitar<00:02:55.770> it's<00:02:56.770> got<00:02:57.190> a<00:02:57.220> very<00:02:57.400> bright<00:02:57.670> tone

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
guitar it's got a very bright tone

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.900 
guitar it's got a very bright tone
compared<00:02:58.450> to<00:02:58.630> the<00:02:59.020> base<00:02:59.470> wood<00:02:59.710> on<00:02:59.910> that

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
compared to the base wood on that

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.790 
compared to the base wood on that
coupled<00:03:01.720> with<00:03:01.750> a<00:03:01.840> seymour<00:03:02.170> duncan<00:03:02.290> but<00:03:02.680> then

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
coupled with a seymour duncan but then

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.680 
coupled with a seymour duncan but then
again<00:03:03.030> just<00:03:04.030> give<00:03:04.360> a<00:03:04.390> side-by-side

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
again just give a side-by-side

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.270 
again just give a side-by-side
comparison<00:03:07.320> turn<00:03:08.320> the<00:03:08.500> pod<00:03:08.710> off<00:03:08.860> so<00:03:09.130> you<00:03:09.190> don't

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
comparison turn the pod off so you don't

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.150 
comparison turn the pod off so you don't
get<00:03:09.580> distortion<00:03:10.150> ago

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.280 

there<00:03:23.049> you<00:03:23.110> go

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
there you go

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.399 
there you go

back to my urban heirs the 320 NM onto
this<00:04:09.500> is<00:04:09.769> so<00:04:10.459> differently<00:04:10.819> but<00:04:11.269> neither<00:04:11.989> say

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:12.349 
this is so differently but neither say

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:14.680 
this is so differently but neither say
still<00:04:12.590> good<00:04:12.769> guitar<00:04:13.069> it<00:04:13.730> might<00:04:14.180> be<00:04:14.299> cast<00:04:14.510> away

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
still good guitar it might be cast away

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.670 
still good guitar it might be cast away
in<00:04:14.810> faith<00:04:15.109> for<00:04:15.409> this<00:04:15.590> and<00:04:16.299> but<00:04:17.299> I<00:04:17.570> reckon<00:04:18.199> for<00:04:18.229> a

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
in faith for this and but I reckon for a

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.450 
in faith for this and but I reckon for a
sort<00:04:19.010> of<00:04:19.449> darker<00:04:20.449> sounding<00:04:20.959> judge<00:04:21.889> engine

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
sort of darker sounding judge engine

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.820 
sort of darker sounding judge engine
chugging<00:04:22.760> sort<00:04:23.120> of<00:04:23.180> tunes<00:04:23.449> I'll<00:04:24.289> pick<00:04:24.620> that

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
chugging sort of tunes I'll pick that

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.610 
chugging sort of tunes I'll pick that
