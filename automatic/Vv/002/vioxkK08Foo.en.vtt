going<00:02:33.569> Dave<00:02:33.959> &amp;<00:02:34.140> Buster's<00:02:34.170> for<00:02:34.920> two<00:02:35.159> reasons

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
going Dave &amp; Buster's for two reasons

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.080 
going Dave &amp; Buster's for two reasons
one<00:02:36.120> it<00:02:36.269> was<00:02:36.360> really<00:02:36.780> fun<00:02:37.049> 33<00:02:37.890> reasons<00:02:38.489> the

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
one it was really fun 33 reasons the

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.390 
one it was really fun 33 reasons the
second<00:02:39.599> reason<00:02:39.750> is<00:02:40.080> because<00:02:40.260> I<00:02:40.500> signed<00:02:41.099> up<00:02:41.280> for

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
second reason is because I signed up for

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.490 
second reason is because I signed up for
the<00:02:41.489> rewards<00:02:41.970> program<00:02:42.450> so<00:02:43.019> if<00:02:43.140> i<00:02:43.260> buy<00:02:43.470> a

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
the rewards program so if i buy a

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.500 
the rewards program so if i buy a
ten-dollar<00:02:44.010> card<00:02:44.400> I<00:02:44.549> get<00:02:44.700> a<00:02:44.730> free<00:02:45.060> ten-dollar

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
ten-dollar card I get a free ten-dollar

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.869 
ten-dollar card I get a free ten-dollar
card<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:46.079> three<00:02:46.860> and<00:02:47.099> I<00:02:47.190> think<00:02:47.459> this<00:02:47.610> is<00:02:47.760> the

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
card and three and I think this is the

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:50.149 
card and three and I think this is the
most<00:02:47.909> important<00:02:48.629> reason<00:02:48.810> I'm<00:02:49.379> sick<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:50.129> tired

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 
most important reason I'm sick and tired
