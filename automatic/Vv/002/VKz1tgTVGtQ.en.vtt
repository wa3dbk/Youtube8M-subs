is<00:01:58.810> in<00:01:58.959> large<00:01:59.140> part<00:01:59.229> due<00:01:59.649> to<00:01:59.679> the<00:01:59.890> lack<00:02:00.729> of

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
is in large part due to the lack of

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:02.969 
is in large part due to the lack of
success<00:02:01.090> from<00:02:01.569> Princess<00:02:02.200> and<00:02:02.349> the<00:02:02.380> Frog<00:02:02.440> and

00:02:05.339 --> 00:02:05.349 
Winnie the Pooh now anyone growing up in

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:07.469 
Winnie the Pooh now anyone growing up in
my<00:02:05.470> generation<00:02:05.860> that's<00:02:06.220> very<00:02:06.940> heartbreaking

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
my generation that's very heartbreaking

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.570 
my generation that's very heartbreaking
and<00:02:07.869> personally<00:02:08.619> I<00:02:08.649> think<00:02:08.770> it's<00:02:09.039> pretty<00:02:09.340> sad

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
and personally I think it's pretty sad

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.760 
and personally I think it's pretty sad
that<00:02:09.729> they<00:02:09.819> had<00:02:09.970> to<00:02:10.060> hang<00:02:10.270> the<00:02:10.569> Fate<00:02:11.230> on<00:02:11.470> those

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
that they had to hang the Fate on those

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.290 
that they had to hang the Fate on those
two<00:02:12.040> movies<00:02:12.400> especially<00:02:12.520> when<00:02:12.970> something

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
two movies especially when something

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.000 
two movies especially when something
like<00:02:13.390> tangled<00:02:13.840> can<00:02:14.050> do<00:02:14.170> so<00:02:14.380> well<00:02:14.560> and<00:02:14.740> I<00:02:14.800> think

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
like tangled can do so well and I think

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.800 
like tangled can do so well and I think
that<00:02:15.130> would<00:02:15.220> have<00:02:15.370> done<00:02:15.520> great<00:02:15.970> as<00:02:16.330> a<00:02:16.360> 2d

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
that would have done great as a 2d

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.370 
that would have done great as a 2d
hand-drawn<00:02:17.800> flow<00:02:18.040> and<00:02:18.750> lastly<00:02:19.750> it<00:02:20.020> looks<00:02:20.200> like

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
hand-drawn flow and lastly it looks like

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.140 
hand-drawn flow and lastly it looks like
the<00:02:20.560> peanuts<00:02:21.130> are<00:02:21.340> gonna<00:02:21.459> be<00:02:21.610> making<00:02:21.790> a<00:02:21.970> trip

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
the peanuts are gonna be making a trip

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.830 
the peanuts are gonna be making a trip
to<00:02:22.209> the<00:02:22.420> big<00:02:22.599> screen<00:02:22.930> in<00:02:23.140> 2015<00:02:23.890> as<00:02:24.180> 3d<00:02:25.180> animated
