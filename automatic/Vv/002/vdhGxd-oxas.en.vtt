00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.880
 fundamental in the development of the 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.919
 Rapidly briefing what we created 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.630
 have based on the feedback of our 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:25.579
 testplayers in many 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.079
 Workouts the slip operation 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:28.849
 have tested her on the basis of this 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:31.160
 We then have the briefings 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:35.360
 developed in cooperation with ours 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.910
 Developers are particularly beautiful 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.629
 the form structure of the rapid here in the 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.949
 light microscope are here the 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.470
 exceptionally large pores the verbs 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:46.610
 can measure microscopically and 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.590
 can evaluate 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.840
 we have many larger spaces 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.840
 swim with others 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.890
 The land mix consists of over 15 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.230
 constituents which is the main constituent: 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.750
 Natural rubber from controlled cultivation 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.509
 everything from a selected plantation 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.670
 we start with a reactive one 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:13.520
 Mix it here on the roller 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.770
 is opened first time the mix 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.820
 tree on the roller must next 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.610
 here the color too 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.820
 the chemicals are now mixed 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.130
 but make the mixture reactive 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.950
 There are two chemical reactions 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.450
 synchronize the crosslinking reaction and 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.220
 the third-party reaction 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:36.500
 The latter is such a kind of baking powder 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.250
 later in vulcanization process for the 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.530
 pore 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.720
 These chemicals will also roll 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.539
 thoroughly one after the other mixed 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.220
 Distributed at the end of the mix so worried 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.409
 called fabric blender for one 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.950
 thorough left right distribution of all 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.950
 ingredients 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.320
 at the conception of a 90 of the plaque 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.880
 is of course to note that here are two 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.510
 components have to play together 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.850
 have to 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.060
 that is, on the one hand, the swam to the other 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:21.430
 but also the login rubber and if one 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.590
 is to function well covering must then 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.709
 These two components be tuned 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.280
 That's something we started from the beginning 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.280
 to have to do 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.070
 already includes the basic education 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.930
 both components in the development 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.940
 the water has seen us too 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.650
 this particular also swam 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.070
 make changes to don gummer 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.280
 have to 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.630
 that is, here was another 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.989
 mix for the over coby use the 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.940
 was reintroduced and with this 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.280
 interplay of the new mix and the 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.950
 new sponge we could do a lot 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.800
 generate good resonance of the coating around 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.150
 thus also the maximum spin from the 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.239
 to get it out 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.570
 Here we see a simulation of the 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:08.190
 Influence of his balles with rotation in 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:11.980
 a covering and you can be very good here 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.810
 recognize that the ball is being slowed down 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.299
 the energy in the rotation in it 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.480
 is stored in the lining and with 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:22.239
 because of optimal given back 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.060
 is that we reversed this spin here 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:28.470
 to the lining and thus the spin 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.470
 maximize effect 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:36.390
 However, we have some analogies to 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.239
 formula 1 as well as there the tire optimally 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.849
 can also stick to the street 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:44.010
 here the plaque only work if 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:47.579
 the friction three per patient 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.950
 between ball and covering optimally 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:51.540
 that too was the goal of this new document 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.689
 development so we really here 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.310
 have reached an optimum system the 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:58.200
 formula we found for the fast 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.900
 We also have a lot on us now 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.370
 Potential shows what we do for others 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.150
 so that we can vote 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.540
 can say 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.540
 the development continues at a rapid pace 

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:13.859
 others are the firm view 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.109
 that there is not the perfect surface 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:18.539
 but only the individually fitting 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.430
 covering for every special player type 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:22.500
 the development of the other sand was 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.139
 definitely very time consuming and has 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.910
 much effort but like that 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:29.060
 result in the end showed it has changed 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.060
 worth
