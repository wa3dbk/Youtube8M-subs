00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:06.390
 Welcome to a survival games 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:13.500
 the hero of the ugly right 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:14.730
 ugly skater on the reindeer shavings 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.310
 server play now 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.750
 and yes I have such a 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.789
 Germany practiced a few rounds or 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.039
 tested I play privately so 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.150
 little bit without recording and 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.529
 try that a little bit at all 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.230
 to come in here in the scheme 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.230
 and it does not work for me 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:36.059
 and I think that every server 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:40.020
 Safety plays differently and individually 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:44.120
 is and here it really would have been like that 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.120
 I say a bit extreme 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:04.710
 and I think I think so 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.060
 example on the windows server namely 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.030
 also with pc's server game 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.770
 I'm to every round because no one and 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.390
 there she is, she is the people too 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.340
 kill that's easy is that's just 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.710
 just easy 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.060
 then there are not five games after that 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.899
 there you are already penetrated when the 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.819
 people just start something in my com 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:29.600
 is a good mediocre 

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:35.250
 I do not have to look that good 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:37.289
 Renn Schnitzel does not know it 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.850
 is also just very strange must be the 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:40.500
 That's why I play directly like that 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:46.679
 Just a few rounds, that's just me 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:51.780
 that practice over, of course , does that 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:54.149
 Master is always and that 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.700
 most dangerous to renesas servers are 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.380
 stop spectator if you throw a npd 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.700
 could catch that and then you're dead 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.009
 I would have done that a few times now 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.479
 It also had nice things on it 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.659
 In the end I would have iron swords everything 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.850
 possible and then completely down because in 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.510
 Spectator in the air over the hillside 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.310
 my app has blogged 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.640
 beautiful was a picture for the gods 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.930
 yes and that's how it somehow finds its way 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.090
 I do not have that key yet 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.220
 it 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.530
 I just have a few rounds 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.440
 constantly playing private games so easy too 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.420
 practice at the time to figure this one's 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.569
 but 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.319
 I'm doing very well, very often two 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.319
 hit shit 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:47.680
 no 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.120
 probably or the best here 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:55.870
 Still the kik is said to be the golden one 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:58.210
 character so showdown is yes I am 32 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.340
 We prefer to write incredibly 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.709
 many people play through the whole time 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.480
 it is clear to me then that the people 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.550
 can not write back firstly 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.740
 I'm at the game at the fight on watch 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.390
 am doing and I just write 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.040
 likes throughout which to people 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.910
 therefore, of course, do not answer 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.530
 can be a bit annoying here 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.420
 No it is annoying but I can stop 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.600
 just do not give answers sometimes 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.620
 then comes papke answer as can 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:29.620
 you do not answer 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:33.370
 you're lost already need understanding 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.820
 I will not immediately insult everything 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.820
 what in mine 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:45.670
 currently 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:56.490
 tested with rose but we are not 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:58.190
 opponent is too big , the maps are not that 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:03.000
 you would not find any opponents 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:08.580
 Finally I say so only two 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.530
 remember only 12 mm pity that the player 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.960
 did not have fun hd i wanted 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:16.440
 So say twelve player game modes to me 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:25.640
 actually really cool 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:30.960
 something there on 24 52 was indeed 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:32.250
 I have to say that I like it 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.900
 the key is not very good 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.890
 That's just a small community 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:40.020
 yes true on sevengames designed and the 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.300
 Diet Metz and everything and rang 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.270
 supporters are very nice and help 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.340
 one directly and also want to help and 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.710
 the ship, for example, quite cool that 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.290
 we are a little nicer 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.880
 communitys hawaiis 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.180
 that's why I like it damned 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.820
 Well 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:01.520
 I only have that ratio at all 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:08.390
 not on it was the story of 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:08.390
 there yesterday morning 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:23.390
 the question is now where do I find that 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:25.130
 the last damn thing is already happening 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.700
 ten years of people once in a circle 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:37.730
 ran 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:48.380
 So he gets killed once around the map 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:54.410
 Now that until now is its okay the dms 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:56.980
 already dm and I do not have much 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.980
 done 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:11.420
 full of ugly child age full of 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:12.830
 Hesse is in ugly skin as you can 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:25.310
 not with the ugly skins today 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:26.720
 but if the twelfth is none 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:29.510
 Strikes and I thought now in the evening 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.250
 high just or with one thing 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:32.390
 that comes I wanted to tell it 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.920
 that's in recent times as a 

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:38.060
 a little bit private games and over 

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:44.840
 if you want to see more of rachel 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:46.820
 server soon then writes and yes 

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.020
 Who should do it again next year? 

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.910
 I will continue a bit 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:54.530
 cocky example full samples and 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:55.460
 then everything crashed on my text 

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:58.070
 You do not need to be happy about it 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.330
 everything is broken can also helped here 

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:01.520
 actually win more often 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:04.390
 is possibly the hardest in the world 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.390
 red support for me
