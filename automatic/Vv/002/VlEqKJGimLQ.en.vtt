00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.330
 hello guys today we're going to see how 

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:09.040
 on the edge of a baby blanket there is 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.140
 many types of edges of course with 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.450
 rifles etcetera but that this in 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.600
 particular is very good 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:19.090
 it was the Portuguese point this famous that 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.440
 we have seen that it is called point das 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.750
 marinas 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:27.440
 I leave the link here for you to see is 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.390
 a special point for baby blankets 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.360
 and this point is on that same page 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.850
 I liked this edge and that's why I've 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.800
 translated and I bring today the be 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.590
 besides that it is very simple and very little 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:43.190
 seen the first thing we have to do 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.890
 is to ride 11 points plus two points of 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.830
 brightness is 13 points now 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.420
 I'm working, they do not need needles 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.340
 double point for this I do it because 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.540
 it's more comfortable for me that the needle is 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.960
 the shorter the better 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:01.020
 this is a 5 millimeter needle and this 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.949
 it's a fine balloon like you see 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.600
 then all the even turns are from 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.850
 back the second the fourth to the sixth 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.490
 etcetera so you have to have a lot of 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.250
 backwards to make this edge but I think 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.420
 it's worth it 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.420
 then we go there 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:23.040
 we assembled that 11 213 points the first 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.909
 point is the point of brightness not what 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.240
 we have 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:30.860
 and we have 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.030
 10 points upside down 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.390
 one 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.390
 two 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:56.120
 loop or evra 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.120
 look how it's done like this 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.130
 a point of the reverse 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.900
 and the shore point that is this 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.900
 straight 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.640
 the second round all of the other way round 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.470
 I'm going to do this so they can see how 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.170
 knit that increase is laced 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.520
 the first one does not knit the one of brightness and 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.400
 all the reverse 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.400
 including the loop or strand and 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:28.250
 until the end 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.250
 ending with the last point 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:35.110
 brightness 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.110
 of the right as we already know 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.360
 all even turns are woven like this 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.890
 how is this that I am showing you 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.820
 so we're not going to do the 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.820
 boxes 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:55.410
 third round point of brightness that on it 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.410
 it is knitted ten points inside out but 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.049
 no no 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.909
 9 10 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:23.159
 Loop and now as we had increased 1 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:23.159
 they will be one but two backwards 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:34.180
 and the last of brightness of the right 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:38.110
 then from now on this is what 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:40.560
 that we are starting here this is what 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.209
 what are we going to have here 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.610
 in the written instructions that are 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.270
 at 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:49.580
 in the blog I'm willy dotcom will see how 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:52.130
 we always have 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.750
 10 stitches points and then in the next 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.310
 back will be 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.830
 the next next novel is from 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.170
 back I mean in the fifth instead 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:04.200
 of two after the strand will be three in 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:09.150
 the seventh will be four and so on until 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:12.810
 we get to the number 19 turn where 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:17.220
 after the loop we will have 10 more 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:20.100
 punto de orilla la 20 is the other way around 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.680
 all pairs and now we come back for 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:27.200
 that they see what is done in the 21 that is 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.200
 the last round we go there 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.139
 okay 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:35.669
 we just knit the number 20 spin 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:37.800
 upside down and now we go to 21 and here 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:41.380
 what we have to do is close 10 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:44.760
 points of the reverse 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.880
 we passed the first without doing 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.510
 one upside down 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.510
 and we ride 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:57.670
 without doing about the one that we just tea 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:05:01.290
 without thinking without talking much thread and 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.290
 we repeat already we take one closed 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.770
 do not pull the thread when they close because 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.770
 remains 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:35.129
 narrow 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:39.390
 and it's not going to be the peak form 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:47.980
 it's not going to be the pretty peak and here 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:50.530
 we have come again to the point of 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.810
 principle that it was as if we had 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.790
 mounted the two 11 plus 2 points of 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:59.190
 shore we start again from the 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:59.190
 return number 1 look how is it 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.430
 we are doing these peaks 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:11.230
 and the blanket 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.230
 the co we would be here 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:14.910
 so for example 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:20.610
 that this was this is a sample 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.610
 imagine that I'm out of work 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:26.800
 as the point is that I was telling them 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:29.259
 Thank you very much the handcuffs that I 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:32.500
 I call it the Portuguese point as a 

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:34.880
 little peak also because this edge is 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:37.340
 excellent for that 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.920
 another thing when we have things 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.140
 baby 

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:44.260
 we usually use much finer needles than 

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:47.800
 this one I made this video with 

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:50.230
 this number 5 needle so they can 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:56.740
 see better but in reality we should 

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:59.670
 knit with a 2.53 needle this is even 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.670
 3.5 

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:06.350
 the difference 

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:08.660
 even thinner than this 2.53 would be the 

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:11.289
 ideal to drink on the scale because the 

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:13.600
 Baby's body is tiny then 

00:07:11.289 --> 00:07:16.750
 that does not look like it stops a 

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:19.060
 an extreme gneiting garment 

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:21.160
 Well I leave you here 

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:24.280
 Any doubt or question you already know where 

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:28.380
 find me I'm willy dotcom 

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.380
 Take advantage until the next
