deflated right now I can sit here and

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.000 
deflated right now I can sit here and
try<00:00:09.570> and<00:00:09.599> deflate<00:00:09.960> it<00:00:10.110> all<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.410> way<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:10.740> see

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
sitting right on the bead so I want to

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.040 
sitting right on the bead so I want to
make<00:00:42.840> sure<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:43.140> get<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.379> off<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.890> bead<00:00:45.050> see

how I'm pushing it in there do the same
to<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.809> other<00:00:51.840> side

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.340 

now

you<00:01:13.920> saw<00:01:14.159> how<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.369> just<00:01:14.700> tried<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:14.909> muscle<00:01:15.450> that

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
you saw how I just tried to muscle that

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.510 
you saw how I just tried to muscle that
right<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:16.080> just<00:01:16.350> kind<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.590> like<00:01:16.799> really<00:01:17.189> tried

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
right I just kind of like really tried

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.980 
right I just kind of like really tried
to<00:01:17.549> squeeze<00:01:17.939> all<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.479> became<00:01:18.720> quite

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
to squeeze all that and it became quite

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.130 
to squeeze all that and it became quite
difficult<00:01:19.229> so<00:01:20.330> in<00:01:21.330> order<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.600> get<00:01:21.750> this<00:01:21.900> tire

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
difficult so in order to get this tire

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.170 
difficult so in order to get this tire
off<00:01:22.350> it's<00:01:22.590> dry<00:01:22.920> right<00:01:23.220> now<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.670> what<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:23.850> need<00:01:23.970> to

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.210 
off it's dry right now so what I need to
do<00:01:24.330> somehow<00:01:24.630> lubricate<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.290> now<00:01:25.920> what<00:01:26.130> I've

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
do somehow lubricate it now what I've

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.010 
do somehow lubricate it now what I've
got<00:01:26.250> mixed<00:01:26.700> in<00:01:26.820> this<00:01:26.970> little<00:01:27.240> context<00:01:27.780> aligned

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
got mixed in this little context aligned

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.770 
got mixed in this little context aligned
lens<00:01:28.470> solution<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:29.040> about<00:01:29.700> 50%<00:01:30.119> Dawn

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
lens solution is about 50% Dawn

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.139 
lens solution is about 50% Dawn
dishwashing<00:01:31.259> liquid<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:31.890> some<00:01:32.369> water<00:01:32.610> so<00:01:33.119> I

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
dishwashing liquid and some water so I

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:36.289 
dishwashing liquid and some water so I
get<00:01:33.619> unlike<00:01:34.619> what<00:01:34.830> pretty<00:01:35.759> much<00:01:35.850> like<00:01:36.119> what

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
get unlike what pretty much like what

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.840 
get unlike what pretty much like what
you<00:01:36.390> see<00:01:36.600> at<00:01:36.899> a<00:01:37.159> car<00:01:38.159> dealership<00:01:38.190> so<00:01:38.700> where

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
you see at a car dealership so where

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.109 
you see at a car dealership so where
they<00:01:38.970> will<00:01:39.539> go<00:01:39.899> in<00:01:40.080> here<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.940> lubricate<00:01:41.940> this

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
they will go in here and lubricate this

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.529 
they will go in here and lubricate this
right<00:01:43.580> but<00:01:44.580> I'm<00:01:44.640> gonna<00:01:44.759> be<00:01:44.909> pulling<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.299> tire

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539 
right but I'm gonna be pulling the tire

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:48.080 
right but I'm gonna be pulling the tire
off<00:01:45.780> of<00:01:45.960> this<00:01:46.110> side<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:47.640> know<00:01:47.729> put<00:01:47.909> some

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
off of this side so you know put some

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.790 
off of this side so you know put some
juice<00:01:48.300> in<00:01:48.450> there<00:01:48.659> so<00:01:49.050> I<00:01:49.080> could<00:01:49.350> use<00:01:49.530> this

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
juice in there so I could use this

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.340 
juice in there so I could use this
that's<00:01:50.550> one<00:01:50.850> method<00:01:51.090> if<00:01:51.330> you<00:01:51.450> want<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.750> go<00:01:52.319> a

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
that's one method if you want to go a

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.320 
that's one method if you want to go a
little<00:01:52.590> bit<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.830> cleaner<00:01:53.039> but<00:01:53.670> what<00:01:53.850> we<00:01:53.970> found

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
little bit of cleaner but what we found

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.080 
little bit of cleaner but what we found
that<00:01:54.479> works<00:01:54.720> better<00:01:55.050> is<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:56.310> silicone<00:01:56.819> spray

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
that works better is a silicone spray

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.550 
that works better is a silicone spray
the<00:01:57.360> silicone<00:01:57.810> spray<00:01:58.050> will<00:01:59.990> evaporate<00:02:00.990> when

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
the silicone spray will evaporate when

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.840 
the silicone spray will evaporate when
you're<00:02:01.679> done<00:02:01.830> using<00:02:02.039> it<00:02:02.220> of<00:02:02.369> course<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:02.670> want

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
you're done using it of course you want

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.930 
you're done using it of course you want
to<00:02:02.909> use<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.149> in<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.270> well-ventilated<00:02:03.720> area<00:02:04.940> but

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
to use it in a well-ventilated area but

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:12.199 
to use it in a well-ventilated area but
I'm<00:02:06.030> gonna<00:02:06.179> take<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:08.239> and<00:02:10.250> get<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.400> in<00:02:11.549> there<00:02:11.760> so

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
I'm gonna take it and get it in there so

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.150 
I'm gonna take it and get it in there so
when<00:02:12.510> I<00:02:12.540> go<00:02:12.750> to<00:02:12.780> remove<00:02:13.080> this<00:02:13.260> tire<00:02:13.500> first

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
when I go to remove this tire first

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.199

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
these two beads together there's a

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.580 
these two beads together there's a
v-shape<00:02:17.579> on<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:18.510> inside<00:02:18.840> of<00:02:18.870> this<00:02:19.110> rim<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:19.530> I

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
v-shape on the inside of this rim and I

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.560 
v-shape on the inside of this rim and I
want<00:02:19.769> to<00:02:19.860> get<00:02:19.950> these<00:02:20.100> two<00:02:20.340> beads<00:02:20.579> closest<00:02:21.450> to

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
want to get these two beads closest to

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.420 
want to get these two beads closest to
that<00:02:21.750> so<00:02:21.930> you<00:02:21.959> can<00:02:22.170> see<00:02:22.200> that<00:02:22.500> as<00:02:22.950> I<00:02:23.130> start<00:02:23.370> to

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
that so you can see that as I start to

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.220 
that so you can see that as I start to
pull<00:02:23.610> that<00:02:23.640> and<00:02:23.970> I'm<00:02:24.510> starting<00:02:24.750> from<00:02:25.049> the

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
pull that and I'm starting from the

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.849 
pull that and I'm starting from the
valve<00:02:25.530> end<00:02:25.829> I<00:02:26.269> take<00:02:27.269> my<00:02:27.480> lever<00:02:28.140> my<00:02:28.440> blue<00:02:28.650> lever

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:28.859 
valve end I take my lever my blue lever

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:30.380 
valve end I take my lever my blue lever
and<00:02:29.010> you<00:02:29.070> see<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.340> shape<00:02:29.579> of<00:02:29.730> this<00:02:29.820> lever<00:02:30.090> here

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
and you see the shape of this lever here

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.319 
and you see the shape of this lever here
I'm<00:02:30.750> gonna<00:02:30.930> reach<00:02:31.260> into<00:02:31.709> this<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.730> grab<00:02:33.150> the

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
I'm gonna reach into this and grab the

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.949 
I'm gonna reach into this and grab the
edge<00:02:34.760> right<00:02:35.760> so<00:02:36.180> you<00:02:36.239> can<00:02:36.390> see<00:02:36.540> that<00:02:36.690> I'm<00:02:36.810> now

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
edge right so you can see that I'm now

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.750 
edge right so you can see that I'm now
coming<00:02:37.260> over<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.620> edge<00:02:37.709> then<00:02:38.280> I'll<00:02:38.430> place<00:02:38.609> the

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
coming over the edge then I'll place the

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
coming over the edge then I'll place the
tire<00:02:38.970> perpendicular<00:02:39.840> hold<00:02:40.739> my<00:02:40.890> thumb<00:02:41.130> over<00:02:41.310> it

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
tire perpendicular hold my thumb over it

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:54.100 
tire perpendicular hold my thumb over it
and<00:02:42.780> move<00:02:43.739> my<00:02:43.950> hand<00:02:44.160> forward<00:02:45.890> working<00:02:46.890> it

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.380 

you<00:02:54.710> see<00:02:54.920> how<00:02:55.040> I'm<00:02:55.190> keeping<00:02:55.670> the<00:02:55.820> tire<00:02:56.060> edge

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
you see how I'm keeping the tire edge

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.210 
you see how I'm keeping the tire edge
over<00:02:57.050> here<00:02:57.230> so<00:02:57.380> that's<00:02:57.560> why<00:02:57.620> it's<00:02:57.860> important

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
over here so that's why it's important

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.570 
over here so that's why it's important
that<00:02:58.310> I<00:02:58.400> keep<00:02:58.520> my<00:02:58.580> hand<00:02:59.890> working<00:03:00.890> it<00:03:01.160> back<00:03:01.340> and

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
that I keep my hand working it back and

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.830 
that I keep my hand working it back and
forth<00:03:03.310> and<00:03:04.310> there<00:03:04.490> you<00:03:04.610> go<00:03:04.760> tire<00:03:05.390> comes<00:03:05.660> right

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
forth and there you go tire comes right

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.800 
forth and there you go tire comes right
off<00:03:06.430> now<00:03:07.430> the<00:03:07.490> next<00:03:07.880> step<00:03:08.090> is<00:03:08.270> to<00:03:08.480> remove<00:03:08.630> the

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
off now the next step is to remove the

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.900 
off now the next step is to remove the
inner<00:03:09.080> tube<00:03:09.350> and<00:03:12.340> since<00:03:13.340> I<00:03:13.430> don't<00:03:13.490> have<00:03:13.760> any

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
inner tube and since I don't have any

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.360 
inner tube and since I don't have any
air<00:03:14.150> in<00:03:14.360> this<00:03:14.480> tube<00:03:14.950> it's<00:03:15.950> going<00:03:15.980> to<00:03:16.130> make<00:03:16.250> it<00:03:16.340> a

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
air in this tube it's going to make it a

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.390 
air in this tube it's going to make it a
little<00:03:16.490> bit<00:03:16.640> easier<00:03:16.940> and<00:03:18.010> then<00:03:19.010> when<00:03:19.160> I<00:03:19.190> go<00:03:19.340> to

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
little bit easier and then when I go to

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.640 
little bit easier and then when I go to
let's<00:03:19.580> take<00:03:19.700> the<00:03:19.820> last<00:03:20.000> part<00:03:20.300> off<00:03:20.510> I<00:03:20.840> want<00:03:21.560> to

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
let's take the last part off I want to

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.310 
let's take the last part off I want to
just<00:03:21.770> basically<00:03:22.160> pull<00:03:22.520> it<00:03:22.640> over<00:03:22.730> that<00:03:22.970> edge

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
just basically pull it over that edge

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.770 
just basically pull it over that edge
I'll<00:03:24.320> take<00:03:24.560> my<00:03:24.709> tool<00:03:24.980> here<00:03:25.420> let<00:03:26.420> me<00:03:26.450> get<00:03:26.600> some

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
I'll take my tool here let me get some

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:33.340 
I'll take my tool here let me get some
leverage<00:03:30.340> and<00:03:31.340> pull<00:03:31.760> it<00:03:31.850> apart<00:03:32.110> and<00:03:33.110> here's

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
leverage and pull it apart and here's

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.080 
leverage and pull it apart and here's
the<00:03:33.500> V<00:03:33.739> you<00:03:33.980> can<00:03:34.070> see<00:03:34.370> that<00:03:34.640> I<00:03:34.670> was<00:03:34.910> working

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
the V you can see that I was working

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.470 
the V you can see that I was working
with<00:03:35.470> to<00:03:36.470> get<00:03:36.650> these<00:03:36.890> two<00:03:37.190> beads<00:03:37.520> when<00:03:37.790> ice<00:03:37.940> was

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
with to get these two beads when ice was

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.690 
with to get these two beads when ice was
them<00:03:38.780> together<00:03:38.930> I<00:03:39.410> was<00:03:39.800> getting<00:03:40.040> this<00:03:40.250> part<00:03:40.610> of

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
them together I was getting this part of

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.600 
them together I was getting this part of
the<00:03:40.790> bead<00:03:41.000> to<00:03:41.270> sit<00:03:41.900> in<00:03:42.020> here<00:03:42.350> otherwise<00:03:43.160> it's

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
the bead to sit in here otherwise it's

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.970 
the bead to sit in here otherwise it's
sitting<00:03:43.910> on<00:03:44.000> this<00:03:44.180> edge<00:03:44.510> and<00:03:45.320> I'll<00:03:45.470> never<00:03:45.770> get

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
sitting on this edge and I'll never get

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.360 
sitting on this edge and I'll never get
the<00:03:46.100> tire<00:03:46.310> off<00:03:47.739> so<00:03:48.739> there<00:03:48.890> you<00:03:48.980> go

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
the tire off so there you go

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.790 
the tire off so there you go
we<00:03:50.000> removed<00:03:50.300> the<00:03:50.450> tire<00:03:50.630> so<00:03:51.470> now<00:03:51.590> we're<00:03:51.709> going

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
we removed the tire so now we're going

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.430 
we removed the tire so now we're going
to<00:03:51.890> put<00:03:52.010> a<00:03:52.040> new<00:03:52.190> one<00:03:52.310> on
