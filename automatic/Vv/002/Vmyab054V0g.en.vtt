00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
like this we're just gonna make into a

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.040 
like this we're just gonna make into a
little<00:00:30.119> shape<00:00:32.450> try<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.510> make<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.840> like<00:00:34.020> a

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
little shape try to make it like a

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.979 
little shape try to make it like a
rectangle<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.730> this<00:00:35.940> will<00:00:36.090> be<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.360> bottom<00:00:36.570> of

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
rectangle and this will be the bottom of

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.260 
rectangle and this will be the bottom of
the<00:00:37.410> crib<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:37.980> we<00:00:38.879> gotta<00:00:39.030> make<00:00:39.120> sure<00:00:39.180> it's

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
the crib so we gotta make sure it's

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.700 
the crib so we gotta make sure it's
gonna<00:00:39.510> be<00:00:39.570> big<00:00:39.780> enough<00:00:39.809> for<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.230> baby<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.590> lay

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
gonna be big enough for the baby to lay

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.299 
gonna be big enough for the baby to lay
down<00:00:40.739> in<00:00:41.129> that's<00:00:42.120> probably<00:00:42.270> bad<00:00:42.750> big<00:00:43.050> enough

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.139 

and<00:00:47.309> try<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.489> make<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.730> nice<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:47.910> uniform

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
and try to make it nice and uniform

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.020 
and try to make it nice and uniform
uniform<00:00:51.149> means<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.600> same<00:00:51.870> everywhere<00:00:53.030> okay

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
uniform means the same everywhere okay

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.360 
uniform means the same everywhere okay
so<00:00:54.300> that's<00:00:54.449> probably<00:00:54.780> good<00:00:54.960> enough<00:00:55.280> so<00:00:56.280> we're

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
so that's probably good enough so we're

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.950 
so that's probably good enough so we're
gonna<00:00:56.489> take<00:00:56.670> our<00:00:56.820> play-doh<00:00:57.149> knife<00:00:57.859> and<00:00:58.859> cut

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
and cut cut ain't cut so we have this

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.719 
and cut cut ain't cut so we have this
nice<00:01:06.060> rectangle<00:01:07.130> and<00:01:08.130> then<00:01:08.250> we're<00:01:08.400> going<00:01:08.700> to

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729
