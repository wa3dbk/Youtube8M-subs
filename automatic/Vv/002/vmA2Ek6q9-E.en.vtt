00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.960
 why in Russia the worst roads in the world 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.729
 accessible and understandable 

00:00:08.729 --> 00:00:11.959
 reason number one is corruption 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:14.849
 every kilometer of roads russia costs in 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.720
 two and a half times more expensive than 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.080
 European countries 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.869
 compared to us, we overpay at three 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:21.980
 times more 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.869
 compared to China in 4 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.630
 why is russia so special that roads 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.399
 we build more expensive than in 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:31.529
 finland or alaska 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.660
 The answer is simple, so much corruption in 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.860
 road construction 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:37.850
 for real construction 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.359
 about a third of resources are directed 

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:42.979
 which means that roads could be built in 

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:45.280
 three times more 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.720
 reason number two is outdated 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.610
 technology 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:50.530
 t 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.739
 no longer invented a long time ago 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:53.910
 modern technologies 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.000
 road construction 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.070
 Firstly, this is synthetic 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.960
 which does not allow the roadway 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.880
 spread out evenly 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.020
 distributes the load and displays 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.950
 moisture 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.170
 secondly road builders can 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.120
 use different polymeric 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.450
 bitumen and which allow asphalt not 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.190
 collapse at temperature 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.880
 modes from minus 40 c to plus 50 and St. Petersburg at 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.540
 technology compliance road 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.850
 serves 12 15 years and not 3 4 as now 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.490
 it is important to understand that when using 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.680
 modern materials total 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.940
 total cost of the road increases 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.090
 only 1 2 percent 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.610
 however, builders save this 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.310
 the percentage of it does not just do not care about the result 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.790
 He hopes for a new order in 3 4 years 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.820
 when the road collapses 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.780
 as a result add the usual 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.210
 bitumen and the matter synthetics put only 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.479
 for visibility at the edges of the road through 3 4 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.120
 years the road needs to be repaired again and 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.880
 gets paid for repairs again 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.409
 as a result 80 percent of the road 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.119
 Russian Fund until 2020 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.009
 planned to spend on repairs 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.689
 old roads and only 20 percent on 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:06.750
 reconstruction 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.849
 and building new 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.880
 and for the 2011th year of new construction in general 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:14.759
 not scheduled 

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:17.429
 if you build roads by technology 

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:20.249
 in 15 years we will have an average of 

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:23.139
 four times more quality roads 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:24.989
 if this is completely removed 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:25.939
 corruption component 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:28.709
 expensive to manufacture roads 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:29.689
 three times 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:33.109
 this number can be multiplied by 3 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:35.859
 means that for the same money Russia can 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:39.810
 get 10 15 times more new roads 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.079
 in 12 15 years 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.129
 if you handle corruption and health 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:47.369
 Nani builders who do not use 

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:49.109
 modern technologies 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:52.109
 for now itâ€™s just a dream and Russia is losing 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:55.309
 only on bad roads 6 8 percent 

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:57.019
 his Vova poet per year 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.400
 80 percent of accidents according to traffic police 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.459
 associated with road defects 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.369
 because of bad roads in the year happens more than 150 

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:09.389
 ty thousand accidents and kills 20 thousand 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:10.260
 person 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.700
 one of whom may be someone 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.799
 that of your loved ones 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:19.379
 bring it to your friend neighbor and can 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:22.279
 be this neighbor will be mayor governor 

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:24.989
 or president who have enough will 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.620
 to look at 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.130
 the situation is fair 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.589
 open and start acting 

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:34.809
 and then one day we can say 

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:37.389
 Russia is a country of good roads
