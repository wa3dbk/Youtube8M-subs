00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
open up a DMZ port basically what the

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.270 
open up a DMZ port basically what the
DMZ<00:04:40.680> port<00:04:40.950> is<00:04:41.160> that<00:04:41.430> is<00:04:41.700> that<00:04:42.360> it<00:04:43.010> takes<00:04:44.010> off

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
DMZ port is that is that it takes off

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.700 
DMZ port is that is that it takes off
the<00:04:44.460> restrictions<00:04:45.060> on<00:04:45.180> the<00:04:45.210> week<00:04:45.470> which<00:04:46.470> allow

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
the restrictions on the week which allow

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.690 
the restrictions on the week which allow
faster<00:04:47.010> connection<00:04:47.640> and<00:04:48.590> basically<00:04:49.700> no

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
faster connection and basically no

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.210 
faster connection and basically no
conflicts<00:04:51.330> and<00:04:51.750> it<00:04:51.990> doesn't<00:04:52.230> cause<00:04:52.650> conflicts

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
conflicts and it doesn't cause conflicts

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.260 
conflicts and it doesn't cause conflicts
with<00:04:53.400> Nintendo<00:04:53.820> server<00:04:54.320> so<00:04:56.060> it's<00:04:57.060> kind<00:04:57.240> of

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
with Nintendo server so it's kind of

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.010 
with Nintendo server so it's kind of
like<00:04:57.330> opening<00:04:57.750> a<00:04:57.810> port<00:04:58.100> but<00:04:59.390> DMZ<00:05:00.390> works<00:05:00.750> best

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
like opening a port but DMZ works best

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:06.050 
like opening a port but DMZ works best
for<00:05:01.230> the<00:05:01.290> we<00:05:03.860> don't<00:05:04.860> worry<00:05:05.280> about<00:05:05.460> hackers<00:05:05.700> for
