looking forward to it mysteries of Laura
how<00:01:42.689> can<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.110> put<00:01:43.320> this<00:01:43.380> delicately<00:01:43.790> did<00:01:44.790> not

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
how can I put this delicately did not

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.840 
how can I put this delicately did not
like<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.390> no<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:46.530> usually<00:01:47.130> tend<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.430> find<00:01:47.640> good

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
like it no I usually tend to find good

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.999 
like it no I usually tend to find good
things<00:01:48.149> in<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.420> lot<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.630> different<00:01:49.380> shows<00:01:49.560> but

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
things in a lot of different shows but

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.580 
things in a lot of different shows but
this<00:01:50.700> was<00:01:50.970> not<00:01:51.210> one<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.540> them<00:01:51.869> actually<00:01:52.320> when

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
this was not one of them actually when

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.260 
this was not one of them actually when
I'm<00:01:52.680> futures<00:01:53.070> I'm<00:01:53.220> going<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.700> recommend<00:01:53.909> you

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
I'm futures I'm going to recommend you

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.130 
I'm futures I'm going to recommend you
skip<00:01:54.890> because<00:01:55.890> it's<00:01:56.490> not<00:01:56.729> negative<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.990> say<00:01:58.110> I

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
skip because it's not negative to say I

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.719 
skip because it's not negative to say I
just<00:01:58.229> did<00:01:58.530> not<00:01:58.680> like<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.009> protagonist<00:01:59.310> which

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
just did not like the protagonist which

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.969 
just did not like the protagonist which
I<00:01:59.820> guess<00:01:59.969> is<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.180> problem<00:02:00.840> since<00:02:01.229> she's<00:02:01.950> a

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
I guess is a problem since she's a

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.100 
I guess is a problem since she's a
person<00:02:02.280> you're<00:02:02.670> supposed<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:03.270> root<00:02:03.479> for<00:02:03.509> and

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
person you're supposed to root for and

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.139 
person you're supposed to root for and
care<00:02:04.439> for<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:04.950> then<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.189> storyline<00:02:05.670> was<00:02:05.880> just

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
care for and then the storyline was just

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:12.590 
care for and then the storyline was just
a<00:02:06.540> cheesy<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.890> bit<00:02:08.280> just<00:02:09.209> not<00:02:09.539> original

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.670
