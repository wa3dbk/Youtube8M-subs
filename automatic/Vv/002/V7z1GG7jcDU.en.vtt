out<00:01:50.160> the<00:01:50.340> existing<00:01:50.759> registration<00:01:51.110> so<00:01:52.110> you

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
out the existing registration so you

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.680 
out the existing registration so you
know<00:01:52.619> put<00:01:52.830> white<00:01:53.070> across<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.729> if<00:01:54.270> you've<00:01:54.509> got

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
know put white across that if you've got

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.420 
know put white across that if you've got
more<00:01:54.840> advanced<00:01:55.170> software<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:55.830> can<00:01:56.039> get<00:01:56.250> your

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
more advanced software you can get your

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.460 
more advanced software you can get your
sort<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.759> color<00:01:57.030> dropper<00:01:57.330> and<00:01:57.479> pick<00:01:58.200> up<00:01:58.350> the

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
sort of color dropper and pick up the

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.529 
sort of color dropper and pick up the
existing<00:01:58.830> background<00:01:59.009> color<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.729> then<00:02:00.149> spray

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
existing background color and then spray

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:02.839 
existing background color and then spray
it<00:02:00.569> over<00:02:00.959> so<00:02:01.110> it'll<00:02:01.259> blend<00:02:01.440> in<00:02:01.679> then<00:02:02.670> what<00:02:02.819> I

00:02:02.839 --> 00:02:02.849 
it over so it'll blend in then what I

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:06.199 
it over so it'll blend in then what I
found<00:02:03.209> is<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.509> font<00:02:04.520> specifically<00:02:05.520> for<00:02:05.759> license

00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:06.209 
found is a font specifically for license

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:07.969 
found is a font specifically for license
plates<00:02:06.539> on<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.020> internet<00:02:07.410> there's<00:02:07.679> a<00:02:07.740> link

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
plates on the internet there's a link

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.370 
plates on the internet there's a link
down<00:02:08.220> in<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.550> description<00:02:08.640> for<00:02:09.270> this<00:02:09.360> font<00:02:09.690> I

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
down in the description for this font I

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.949 
down in the description for this font I
think<00:02:10.979> it<00:02:11.099> might<00:02:11.280> be<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.459> windows-only<00:02:12.150> font<00:02:12.599> so

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
think it might be a windows-only font so

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.600 
think it might be a windows-only font so
if<00:02:13.170> you've<00:02:13.290> got<00:02:13.410> an<00:02:13.500> Apple<00:02:13.770> Mac<00:02:13.890> I<00:02:14.160> don't<00:02:14.280> know

around the edge from for these two I've

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.450 
around the edge from for these two I've
used<00:04:25.720> some<00:04:25.900> sheet<00:04:26.140> steel<00:04:26.170> I've<00:04:26.980> just<00:04:27.250> bought

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
use for backing I guess you could put it

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.100 
use for backing I guess you could put it
on<00:04:33.160> some<00:04:33.400> wood<00:04:33.610> if<00:04:34.120> you've<00:04:34.510> got<00:04:34.660> some<00:04:34.840> maybe

balsa wood styrene anything like that so

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.840 
balsa wood styrene anything like that so
put<00:04:38.440> it<00:04:38.500> on<00:04:38.560> a<00:04:38.620> backing<00:04:38.920> plate<00:04:39.160> and<00:04:39.400> then

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
put it on a backing plate and then

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.360 
put it on a backing plate and then
you're<00:04:39.970> good<00:04:40.090> to<00:04:40.210> go<00:04:40.240> but<00:04:40.630> a<00:04:41.530> final<00:04:41.800> coat<00:04:42.130> once

and I've got some magnets here that set
in<00:05:18.100> the<00:05:18.220> model<00:05:18.460> already<00:05:18.640> and<00:05:19.270> I<00:05:19.360> can<00:05:19.540> just

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
in the model already and I can just

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.340 
in the model already and I can just
stick<00:05:19.960> this<00:05:20.140> on<00:05:21.690> I've<00:05:22.690> got<00:05:22.870> one<00:05:22.990> set<00:05:23.229> in<00:05:23.320> the
