was<00:02:28.090> able<00:02:28.299> to<00:02:28.450> contribute<00:02:28.900> when<00:02:29.350> the<00:02:29.530> Krauss's

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
was able to contribute when the Krauss's

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.280 
was able to contribute when the Krauss's
built<00:02:30.280> a<00:02:30.400> new<00:02:30.549> free<00:02:30.880> stall<00:02:31.209> barn<00:02:31.569> when<00:02:32.110> we

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
built a new free stall barn when we

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.530 
built a new free stall barn when we
decided<00:02:33.010> to<00:02:33.130> build<00:02:33.280> this<00:02:33.489> barn<00:02:33.760> once<00:02:34.420> the

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
decided to build this barn once the

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.330 
decided to build this barn once the
blueprints<00:02:34.989> came<00:02:35.170> in<00:02:35.380> I<00:02:35.530> looked<00:02:35.890> through<00:02:36.160> them

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
blueprints came in I looked through them

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.280 
blueprints came in I looked through them
and<00:02:36.489> as<00:02:36.700> if<00:02:37.090> blueprints<00:02:37.480> evolved<00:02:38.019> and<00:02:38.170> the

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
and as if blueprints evolved and the

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.960 
and as if blueprints evolved and the
things<00:02:38.620> that<00:02:38.739> we<00:02:38.829> liked<00:02:39.040> I<00:02:39.250> would<00:02:39.400> put<00:02:39.609> in<00:02:39.730> more

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
things that we liked I would put in more

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.370 
things that we liked I would put in more
features<00:02:40.329> and<00:02:40.480> stuff<00:02:40.660> and<00:02:40.870> at<00:02:41.049> the<00:02:41.140> end<00:02:41.290> of

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
features and stuff and at the end of

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.050 
features and stuff and at the end of
this<00:02:41.440> barn<00:02:41.739> I<00:02:41.950> had<00:02:42.100> a<00:02:42.130> couple<00:02:42.370> of<00:02:42.519> features<00:02:43.030> of

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
this barn I had a couple of features of

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.300 
this barn I had a couple of features of
my<00:02:43.359> own

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.940 

Andrew<00:02:48.150> suggested<00:02:48.840> a<00:02:48.959> trust<00:02:49.290> system<00:02:49.709> to

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
Andrew suggested a trust system to

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.150 
Andrew suggested a trust system to
increase<00:02:50.280> airflow<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:51.410> LED<00:02:52.410> lighting<00:02:52.740> and

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
increase airflow and LED lighting and

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.040 
increase airflow and LED lighting and
thermostat<00:02:53.400> controlled<00:02:54.300> curtains<00:02:54.780> to

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
improve cow comfort and increase energy

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.590 
improve cow comfort and increase energy

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
which removes all the liquid and creates

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.870 
which removes all the liquid and creates
a<00:03:14.190> dry<00:03:14.520> bedding<00:03:15.060> for<00:03:15.300> the<00:03:15.360> cows<00:03:15.660> to<00:03:15.690> lay<00:03:16.170> on
