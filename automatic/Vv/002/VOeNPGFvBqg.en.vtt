00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:10.760 
base piece and a side piece the side

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.460 
base piece and a side piece the side
could<00:00:10.970> connect<00:00:11.240> over<00:00:11.480> here<00:00:11.900> and<00:00:12.110> work<00:00:12.200> like<00:00:12.350> an

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:12.470 
could connect over here and work like an

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.680 
could connect over here and work like an
arm<00:00:12.650> or<00:00:13.190> it<00:00:13.460> could<00:00:13.610> connect<00:00:13.880> back<00:00:14.030> here<00:00:14.480> and

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
arm or it could connect back here and

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.839 
arm or it could connect back here and
work<00:00:14.809> like<00:00:14.930> a<00:00:14.960> back<00:00:15.260> you<00:00:16.010> can<00:00:16.160> add<00:00:16.250> any<00:00:16.490> number

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:16.849 
work like a back you can add any number

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:18.820 
work like a back you can add any number
of<00:00:16.939> these<00:00:17.029> identical<00:00:17.600> bases<00:00:18.080> and<00:00:18.199> sides<00:00:18.470> and

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:18.830 
of these identical bases and sides and

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.680 
of these identical bases and sides and
build<00:00:19.039> just<00:00:19.280> about<00:00:19.400> anything<00:00:19.730> you<00:00:19.910> like<00:00:20.150> so

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:20.690

this<00:00:20.840> sofa<00:00:21.289> was<00:00:21.529> actually<00:00:21.860> built<00:00:22.039> from<00:00:22.130> two

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430 
this sofa was actually built from two

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.880 
this sofa was actually built from two
bases<00:00:22.880> and<00:00:23.060> four<00:00:23.420> identical<00:00:23.900> sides<00:00:24.109> but

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
bases and four identical sides but

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.200 
bases and four identical sides but
what's<00:00:25.039> really<00:00:25.340> cool<00:00:25.520> is<00:00:25.580> that<00:00:25.760> you<00:00:25.970> can<00:00:26.090> take

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
what's really cool is that you can take

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.330 
what's really cool is that you can take
these<00:00:26.390> same<00:00:26.720> two<00:00:26.960> bases<00:00:27.410> and<00:00:27.560> turn<00:00:28.039> them<00:00:28.220> the

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
these same two bases and turn them the

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.230 
these same two bases and turn them the
other<00:00:28.490> direction

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
other direction

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.540 
other direction
reattach<00:00:29.720> the<00:00:29.900> sides<00:00:30.260> like<00:00:30.470> this<00:00:30.500> and<00:00:30.949> now<00:00:31.490> you

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
reattach the sides like this and now you

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.279 
reattach the sides like this and now you
have<00:00:31.760> a<00:00:31.789> shorter<00:00:32.239> loveseat<00:00:32.660> if<00:00:32.870> that's<00:00:33.140> what

00:00:33.279 --> 00:00:33.289 
have a shorter loveseat if that's what

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:34.810 
have a shorter loveseat if that's what
you<00:00:33.380> really<00:00:33.500> need<00:00:33.770> no<00:00:34.250> matter<00:00:34.430> how<00:00:34.610> many

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
you really need no matter how many

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.850 
you really need no matter how many
pieces<00:00:35.030> you<00:00:35.300> add<00:00:35.450> no<00:00:36.050> matter<00:00:36.230> how<00:00:36.470> you<00:00:36.530> turn

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
pieces you add no matter how you turn

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.010 
pieces you add no matter how you turn
them<00:00:37.160> they<00:00:37.520> always<00:00:37.940> line<00:00:38.149> up<00:00:38.180> they<00:00:38.660> require<00:00:38.989> no

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
them they always line up they require no

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.990 
them they always line up they require no
tools<00:00:39.530> at<00:00:39.800> all<00:00:39.950> and<00:00:40.190> once<00:00:40.640> they're<00:00:40.820> connected

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
tools at all and once they're connected

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.959 
tools at all and once they're connected
they<00:00:41.690> are<00:00:41.870> rock<00:00:42.140> solid<00:00:42.500> but<00:00:43.430> what's<00:00:43.640> really

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
they are rock solid but what's really

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:45.850

I'm<00:01:08.479> here<00:01:08.600> to<00:01:08.659> show<00:01:08.840> you<00:01:08.869> just<00:01:09.020> a<00:01:09.139> few<00:01:09.380> things

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
I'm here to show you just a few things

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.080 
I'm here to show you just a few things
that<00:01:09.709> you<00:01:09.859> can<00:01:10.009> do<00:01:10.100> with<00:01:10.219> these<00:01:10.340> sectionals<00:01:10.909> so

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
that you can do with these sectionals so

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.580 
that you can do with these sectionals so
now<00:01:11.719> let's<00:01:11.899> take<00:01:12.049> a<00:01:12.079> look<00:01:12.259> at<00:01:12.350> the<00:01:12.439> real<00:01:12.560> thing

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
now let's take a look at the real thing

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.160 
now let's take a look at the real thing
you<00:01:13.490> could<00:01:13.639> start<00:01:13.939> as<00:01:14.029> small<00:01:14.329> as<00:01:14.450> you<00:01:14.539> like<00:01:14.569> one

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
you could start as small as you like one

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.139 
you could start as small as you like one
base<00:01:15.439> plus<00:01:15.799> three<00:01:16.100> sides<00:01:16.399> can<00:01:16.759> build<00:01:16.939> you<00:01:17.029> an

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
base plus three sides can build you an

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:19.149 
base plus three sides can build you an
armchair<00:01:17.389> in<00:01:17.689> just<00:01:17.929> seconds<00:01:18.349> and<00:01:18.709> it's<00:01:18.950> even

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
armchair in just seconds and it's even

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.819 
armchair in just seconds and it's even
big<00:01:19.310> enough<00:01:19.340> for<00:01:19.520> two<00:01:20.380> so<00:01:21.380> maybe<00:01:21.560> now<00:01:21.709> you've

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:21.829 
big enough for two so maybe now you've

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:22.839 
big enough for two so maybe now you've
got<00:01:21.979> a<00:01:22.009> friend<00:01:22.279> and<00:01:22.399> you<00:01:22.490> want<00:01:22.639> to<00:01:22.700> sit

00:01:22.839 --> 00:01:22.849 
got a friend and you want to sit

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:25.029 
got a friend and you want to sit
together<00:01:22.969> at<00:01:23.329> one<00:01:23.719> more<00:01:23.929> base<00:01:24.200> and<00:01:24.529> one<00:01:24.829> more

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
together at one more base and one more

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:28.239 
together at one more base and one more
identical<00:01:25.399> side<00:01:25.759> to<00:01:26.090> build<00:01:26.270> a<00:01:26.329> sofa<00:01:27.099> maybe<00:01:28.099> you

00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:28.249 
identical side to build a sofa maybe you

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:29.260
