ingots around the oil bucket to create
your<00:03:03.400> jetpack<00:03:03.970> and<00:03:04.210> let's<00:03:04.660> test<00:03:05.170> it<00:03:05.380> out<00:03:05.530> and

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
your jetpack and let's test it out and

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.620 
your jetpack and let's test it out and
this<00:03:06.160> is<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.580> jetpack<00:03:07.090> now<00:03:07.330> you<00:03:07.390> need<00:03:07.600> a

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
this is the jetpack now you need a

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.650 
this is the jetpack now you need a
double<00:03:08.110> tap<00:03:08.410> spacebar<00:03:09.160> to<00:03:09.340> flyer<00:03:09.820> and<00:03:10.180> you're

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
double tap spacebar to flyer and you're

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.510 
double tap spacebar to flyer and you're
lying<00:03:11.230> away<00:03:12.630> we<00:03:13.680> there<00:03:14.680> we<00:03:14.860> go<00:03:15.010> let's<00:03:15.250> see<00:03:15.430> if

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
on 30 frames nothing too bad and let's

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.130 
on 30 frames nothing too bad and let's
walk<00:03:43.810> in<00:03:44.080> and<00:03:44.940> go<00:03:45.940> through<00:03:46.209> this<00:03:46.360> smoky

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
walk in and go through this smoky

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.400 
walk in and go through this smoky
grenades<00:03:47.590> you<00:03:47.860> can't<00:03:48.100> see<00:03:48.280> anything<00:03:48.580> in<00:03:48.820> here

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
grenades you can't see anything in here

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.440 
grenades you can't see anything in here
okay<00:03:50.410> so<00:03:51.310> that's<00:03:51.489> basically<00:03:51.670> and<00:03:52.239> then<00:03:52.360> it

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
okay so that's basically and then it

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.979 
okay so that's basically and then it
vaporizes<00:03:53.260> away<00:03:53.739> now<00:03:54.070> this<00:03:54.670> is<00:03:55.030> a<00:03:55.300> grenade<00:03:55.750> now

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
vaporizes away now this is a grenade now

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.410 
vaporizes away now this is a grenade now
can<00:03:56.230> throw<00:03:56.500> the<00:03:56.620> grenade<00:03:56.980> and<00:03:57.220> I<00:03:57.880> do<00:03:58.030> believe

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
can throw the grenade and I do believe

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.120 
can throw the grenade and I do believe
it<00:03:58.600> is<00:03:58.630> a<00:03:58.750> sticky<00:03:59.230> grenade<00:03:59.680> and<00:04:01.200> we<00:04:02.200> can<00:04:02.440> throw

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
it is a sticky grenade and we can throw

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.920 
it is a sticky grenade and we can throw
down<00:04:03.160> here<00:04:03.700> under<00:04:03.970> I<00:04:04.150> think<00:04:04.510> I<00:04:04.570> might<00:04:04.720> make<00:04:04.870> a

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
down here under I think I might make a

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.280 
down here under I think I might make a
boo-boo<00:04:05.320> and<00:04:05.940> go<00:04:06.940> through<00:04:07.300> yeah<00:04:07.720> I<00:04:07.959> thought<00:04:08.230> so

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
boo-boo and go through yeah I thought so

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.150 
boo-boo and go through yeah I thought so
okay<00:04:09.070> we'll<00:04:09.670> throw<00:04:09.880> down<00:04:09.910> here<00:04:10.510> now<00:04:11.410> exploder

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
okay we'll throw down here now exploder
