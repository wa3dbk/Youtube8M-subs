that now he's probably not gonna want to

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.580 
that now he's probably not gonna want to
stay<00:01:38.619> in<00:01:39.030> but<00:01:40.030> if<00:01:40.240> he<00:01:40.360> does<00:01:40.659> he's<00:01:41.229> gonna<00:01:41.350> start

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
stay in but if he does he's gonna start
