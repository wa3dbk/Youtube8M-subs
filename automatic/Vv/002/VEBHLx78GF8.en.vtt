to make sure that you have enough
plastic<00:00:50.250> spiders<00:00:50.850> for<00:00:51.809> each<00:00:52.190> web<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.579> you

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
plastic spiders for each web that you

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:02.560 
plastic spiders for each web that you
create<00:00:58.879> once<00:00:59.879> you've<00:01:00.090> added<00:01:00.329> all<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.680> webs

you<00:01:03.570> can<00:01:03.780> see<00:01:04.080> here<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.769> have<00:01:05.060> created<00:01:06.060> eight<00:01:06.540> of

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
you can see here I have created eight of

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.370 
you can see here I have created eight of
them<00:01:06.869> all<00:01:07.140> around<00:01:07.290> in<00:01:07.770> different<00:01:07.950> sizes

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
them all around in different sizes

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.530 
them all around in different sizes
you're<00:01:10.380> going<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.740> take<00:01:10.890> your<00:01:10.950> black<00:01:11.640> sharpie

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
you're going to take your black sharpie

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.130 
you're going to take your black sharpie
oil-based<00:01:13.470> paint<00:01:14.010> pen<00:01:14.369> in<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:15.030> fine<00:01:15.720> point

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
oil-based paint pen in a fine point

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.160 
oil-based paint pen in a fine point
which<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.130> thicker<00:01:17.520> nib<00:01:18.240> than<00:01:18.780> the

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
which is a thicker nib than the

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.910 
which is a thicker nib than the
ultrafine<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.400> start<00:01:21.350> creating<00:01:22.350> different

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
ultrafine and start creating different

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.080 
ultrafine and start creating different
angles<00:01:23.610> on<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.180> pumpkin<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:25.670> couple<00:01:26.670> things<00:01:26.880> to

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
angles on the pumpkin a couple things to

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.260 
angles on the pumpkin a couple things to
note<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:28.500> definitely<00:01:28.799> want<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.759> use

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
note is that you definitely want to use

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.410 
note is that you definitely want to use
a<00:01:30.630> fine<00:01:31.380> point<00:01:31.860> instead<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.820> ultrafine

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
a fine point instead of the ultrafine

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.160 
a fine point instead of the ultrafine
point<00:01:34.040> for<00:01:35.040> this<00:01:35.400> step<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.450> might<00:01:36.750> be<00:01:36.900> tempting

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
point for this step it might be tempting

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.580 
point for this step it might be tempting
to<00:01:37.500> use<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.070> ultrafine<00:01:38.670> point<00:01:39.320> because<00:01:40.320> you

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
to use the ultrafine point because you

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.490 
to use the ultrafine point because you
can<00:01:40.740> get<00:01:40.950> more<00:01:41.100> detail<00:01:41.610> on<00:01:41.909> things<00:01:42.270> into<00:01:43.110> your

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
can get more detail on things into your

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.929 
can get more detail on things into your
design<00:01:44.340> but<00:01:45.270> if<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.810> do<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.700> you're<00:01:47.700> going

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
design but if you do that you're going

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.940 
design but if you do that you're going
to<00:01:48.119> be<00:01:48.240> sitting<00:01:48.540> there<00:01:48.840> for<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.170> very<00:01:49.470> very<00:01:49.619> long

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
to be sitting there for a very very long

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.499 
to be sitting there for a very very long
time<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.790> create<00:01:51.720> your<00:01:51.840> pumpkin<00:01:53.060> for<00:01:54.060> example

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
time to create your pumpkin for example

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.389 
time to create your pumpkin for example
this<00:01:54.659> little<00:01:55.140> pumpkin<00:01:55.619> it's<00:01:55.920> about<00:01:56.130> eight

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
this little pumpkin it's about eight

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:02.510 
this little pumpkin it's about eight
inches<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:57.210> took<00:01:57.600> me<00:01:59.509> it<00:02:00.509> took<00:02:00.780> me<00:02:01.070> about<00:02:02.070> three

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
inches it took me it took me about three

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.179 
inches it took me it took me about three
hours<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:03.270> draw<00:02:03.540> on<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.079> entire<00:02:04.409> pumpkin<00:02:04.740> and

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
hours to draw on the entire pumpkin and

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.399 
hours to draw on the entire pumpkin and
that<00:02:05.579> is<00:02:05.729> with<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.180> fine<00:02:06.420> point<00:02:06.780> so<00:02:07.049> I<00:02:07.079> can

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
that is with the fine point so I can

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.260 
that is with the fine point so I can
imagine

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
imagine

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.660 
imagine
how<00:02:08.810> many<00:02:09.290> more<00:02:09.560> details<00:02:10.010> I<00:02:10.220> would<00:02:10.340> have<00:02:10.490> to

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
how many more details I would have to

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.390 
how many more details I would have to
add<00:02:10.820> if<00:02:11.240> I<00:02:12.170> were<00:02:12.320> to<00:02:12.440> use<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:12.800> ultra<00:02:13.190> fine

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
add if I were to use the ultra fine

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.860 
add if I were to use the ultra fine
point<00:02:13.790> so<00:02:14.150> just<00:02:14.360> keep<00:02:14.540> that<00:02:14.600> in<00:02:14.810> mind<00:02:16.810> also<00:02:17.810> you

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
point so just keep that in mind also you

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.250 
point so just keep that in mind also you
want<00:02:18.230> to<00:02:18.260> make<00:02:18.320> sure<00:02:18.470> that<00:02:19.070> you're<00:02:19.220> not

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
want to make sure that you're not

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.000 
want to make sure that you're not
running<00:02:21.260> your<00:02:21.560> hand<00:02:21.980> along<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:23.770> design<00:02:24.770> that

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
running your hand along the design that

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.070 
running your hand along the design that
you're<00:02:25.160> creating<00:02:25.460> because<00:02:26.240> this<00:02:26.450> is<00:02:26.630> a<00:02:26.660> paint

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
you're creating because this is a paint

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.830 
you're creating because this is a paint
pen<00:02:27.440> and<00:02:27.770> not<00:02:28.040> just<00:02:28.250> a<00:02:28.430> sharpie<00:02:28.940> you<00:02:29.600> can

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
pen and not just a sharpie you can

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.200 
pen and not just a sharpie you can
easily<00:02:31.090> spread<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.750> paint<00:02:33.440> and<00:02:34.000> you<00:02:35.000> don't

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
easily spread the paint and you don't

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.910 
easily spread the paint and you don't
want<00:02:35.420> to<00:02:35.510> do<00:02:35.630> that<00:02:35.660> it<00:02:35.960> would<00:02:36.050> smear<00:02:36.620> and<00:02:36.770> it

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
want to do that it would smear and it

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.550 
want to do that it would smear and it
just<00:02:37.100> wouldn't<00:02:37.340> look<00:02:37.370> very<00:02:37.490> pretty<00:02:38.080> so<00:02:39.080> keep

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
just wouldn't look very pretty so keep

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.350 
just wouldn't look very pretty so keep
that<00:02:39.620> in<00:02:39.830> mind<00:02:40.130> as<00:02:40.370> well<00:02:40.610> it<00:02:40.880> doesn't<00:02:41.330> take

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
that in mind as well it doesn't take

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.640 
that in mind as well it doesn't take
very<00:02:41.690> long<00:02:41.810> for<00:02:41.990> these<00:02:42.380> to<00:02:42.650> dry<00:02:43.540> but<00:02:44.540> you<00:02:44.750> it

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
very long for these to dry but you it

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.530 
very long for these to dry but you it
does<00:02:45.920> take<00:02:46.160> about<00:02:46.310> a<00:02:46.460> minute<00:02:46.640> ourselves<00:02:47.330> so

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
does take about a minute ourselves so

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.660 
does take about a minute ourselves so
just<00:02:48.320> keep<00:02:48.470> that<00:02:48.530> in<00:02:48.710> mind<00:02:48.980> as<00:02:49.310> you're<00:02:49.460> going

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
just keep that in mind as you're going

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.600 
just keep that in mind as you're going
along<00:02:50.000> to<00:02:50.720> keep<00:02:51.140> your<00:02:51.380> hand<00:02:51.680> out<00:02:51.950> of<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:52.400> way

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
along to keep your hand out of the way

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:58.180 
along to keep your hand out of the way
so<00:02:53.360> it<00:02:53.510> doesn't<00:02:53.540> smear<00:02:56.410> so<00:02:57.410> this<00:02:57.680> is<00:02:57.860> just<00:02:58.040> a

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
so it doesn't smear so this is just a

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.430 
so it doesn't smear so this is just a
very<00:02:58.220> basic<00:02:58.640> design<00:02:59.270> that<00:02:59.630> I'm<00:02:59.750> using<00:02:59.990> and

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
very basic design that I'm using and

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.500 
very basic design that I'm using and
that's<00:03:00.740> what<00:03:00.980> I<00:03:01.010> would<00:03:01.130> recommend<00:03:01.400> for<00:03:02.330> the

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
that's what I would recommend for the

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.740 
that's what I would recommend for the
pumpkin<00:03:02.960> is<00:03:03.140> just<00:03:03.410> big<00:03:03.710> open<00:03:04.340> thick<00:03:05.210> designs

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
pumpkin is just big open thick designs

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:13.150 
pumpkin is just big open thick designs
without<00:03:06.220> too<00:03:07.220> many<00:03:07.490> teeny<00:03:08.330> tiny<00:03:08.600> details<00:03:12.160> so

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
without too many teeny tiny details so

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.100 
without too many teeny tiny details so
I'm<00:03:13.340> just<00:03:13.490> going<00:03:13.700> to<00:03:13.820> fast<00:03:14.270> forward<00:03:14.570> this<00:03:14.810> part

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
I'm just going to fast forward this part

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:27.900 
I'm just going to fast forward this part
a<00:03:15.260> little<00:03:15.410> bit<00:03:15.709> and<00:03:15.890> show<00:03:16.310> you<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:16.550> next<00:03:16.700> step

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.990 

so<00:03:28.910> here<00:03:29.270> is<00:03:29.480> my<00:03:29.720> completed<00:03:30.320> pumpkin<00:03:31.040> drawing

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
so here is my completed pumpkin drawing

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.360 
so here is my completed pumpkin drawing
on<00:03:32.390> it<00:03:32.750> after<00:03:33.020> drawing<00:03:33.350> on<00:03:33.650> it<00:03:33.800> for<00:03:34.010> a<00:03:34.040> few

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
on it after drawing on it for a few

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.350 
on it after drawing on it for a few
hours<00:03:34.430> and<00:03:35.860> once<00:03:36.860> all<00:03:37.010> the<00:03:37.130> paint<00:03:37.400> is<00:03:37.580> dry<00:03:38.060> and

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
hours and once all the paint is dry and

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.390 
hours and once all the paint is dry and
everything<00:03:39.050> you<00:03:39.170> can<00:03:39.350> continue<00:03:39.860> on<00:03:40.010> with<00:03:40.250> the

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
everything you can continue on with the

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.560 
everything you can continue on with the
next<00:03:40.430> step<00:03:41.290> which<00:03:42.290> is<00:03:42.500> your<00:03:43.460> spiders<00:03:44.030> now<00:03:44.330> mine

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
next step which is your spiders now mine

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.530 
next step which is your spiders now mine
are<00:03:44.810> spider<00:03:45.170> rings<00:03:45.850> so<00:03:46.850> I'm<00:03:46.970> just<00:03:47.180> holding<00:03:47.330> it

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
are spider rings so I'm just holding it

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.220 
are spider rings so I'm just holding it
by<00:03:47.720> the<00:03:47.750> ring<00:03:48.050> part<00:03:48.380> and<00:03:48.620> i'm<00:03:48.710> using<00:03:49.070> my<00:03:50.230> glue

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.320 
by the ring part and i'm using my glue
pen<00:03:51.590> to<00:03:52.430> put<00:03:52.640> a<00:03:52.670> little<00:03:53.000> dot<00:03:53.330> of<00:03:54.100> glue<00:03:55.100> on<00:03:55.820> to

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
pen to put a little dot of glue on to

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:57.910 
pen to put a little dot of glue on to
the<00:03:56.450> spiders<00:03:56.870> and<00:03:57.110> then<00:03:57.200> dipping<00:03:57.440> it<00:03:57.710> right

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
the spiders and then dipping it right

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.580 
the spiders and then dipping it right
into<00:03:58.100> the<00:03:58.640> glitter<00:03:59.120> then<00:04:00.080> i'm<00:04:00.170> setting<00:04:00.470> it

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
into the glitter then i'm setting it

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.620 
into the glitter then i'm setting it
aside<00:04:00.710> to<00:04:01.130> dry<00:04:01.160> and<00:04:02.120> just<00:04:02.330> putting<00:04:02.600> some

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
aside to dry and just putting some

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.560 
aside to dry and just putting some
random<00:04:03.350> spots<00:04:03.950> of<00:04:04.190> glue<00:04:04.460> along<00:04:05.030> different

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
random spots of glue along different

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.180 
random spots of glue along different
parts<00:04:06.080> of<00:04:06.230> the<00:04:06.290> pumpkin<00:04:06.950> and<00:04:08.440> then<00:04:09.440> i'll<00:04:09.740> take

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
parts of the pumpkin and then i'll take

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.030 
parts of the pumpkin and then i'll take
my<00:04:10.370> glitter<00:04:10.700> and<00:04:11.060> just<00:04:12.050> kind<00:04:12.320> of<00:04:12.410> sprinkle<00:04:12.770> it

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
my glitter and just kind of sprinkle it

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.510 
my glitter and just kind of sprinkle it
on<00:04:13.250> there<00:04:13.780> just<00:04:14.780> to<00:04:15.140> add<00:04:15.890> a<00:04:15.950> little<00:04:16.100> bit<00:04:16.459> of

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:16.520 
on there just to add a little bit of

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.420 
on there just to add a little bit of
sparkle<00:04:17.120> there<00:04:17.330> and<00:04:17.600> i<00:04:18.440> used<00:04:18.680> black<00:04:19.070> glitter

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
sparkle there and i used black glitter

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:20.680 
sparkle there and i used black glitter
so<00:04:19.760> it's<00:04:19.910> just<00:04:20.060> going<00:04:20.209> to<00:04:20.299> add<00:04:20.420> a<00:04:20.450> little

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
so it's just going to add a little

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.750 
so it's just going to add a little
sparkle<00:04:21.080> it's<00:04:21.470> not<00:04:21.650> going<00:04:21.799> to<00:04:21.890> add<00:04:22.130> any<00:04:22.400> color

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
sparkle it's not going to add any color

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.780 
sparkle it's not going to add any color
or<00:04:23.120> anything<00:04:24.010> so<00:04:25.010> i<00:04:25.040> did<00:04:25.280> that<00:04:25.310> in<00:04:25.640> just

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
or anything so i did that in just

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.850 
or anything so i did that in just
various<00:04:26.360> spots<00:04:26.720> i<00:04:27.050> like<00:04:27.230> to<00:04:27.350> add<00:04:27.500> it<00:04:27.710> where

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
various spots i like to add it where

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.700 
various spots i like to add it where
there's<00:04:28.160> other<00:04:28.460> dots<00:04:28.790> or<00:04:29.410> just<00:04:30.410> where<00:04:30.590> it

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
there's other dots or just where it

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.650 
there's other dots or just where it
seems<00:04:30.950> like<00:04:31.490> it<00:04:31.520> would<00:04:31.730> make<00:04:31.940> sense<00:04:31.970> to<00:04:32.420> add<00:04:32.630> a

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
seems like it would make sense to add a

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.890 
seems like it would make sense to add a
little<00:04:32.870> bit<00:04:33.230> of<00:04:33.290> glitter<00:04:34.360> now<00:04:35.360> the<00:04:35.420> glitter<00:04:35.750> is

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
little bit of glitter now the glitter is

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.110 
little bit of glitter now the glitter is
going<00:04:36.170> to<00:04:36.440> if<00:04:36.770> you're<00:04:36.980> using<00:04:37.160> a<00:04:37.340> fake<00:04:37.580> pumpkin

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
going to if you're using a fake pumpkin

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.270 
going to if you're using a fake pumpkin
it's<00:04:38.360> definitely<00:04:38.840> going<00:04:39.050> to<00:04:39.170> just<00:04:39.560> stick

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
it's definitely going to just stick

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.780 
it's definitely going to just stick
there<00:04:40.610> so<00:04:41.000> keep<00:04:41.690> that<00:04:41.750> in<00:04:41.960> mind<00:04:42.160> and<00:04:43.160> you<00:04:43.610> can

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
there so keep that in mind and you can

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.950 
there so keep that in mind and you can
just<00:04:43.910> rinse<00:04:44.180> it<00:04:44.330> off<00:04:44.560> once<00:04:45.560> the<00:04:46.930> glue<00:04:47.930> is

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
just rinse it off once the glue is

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.100 
just rinse it off once the glue is
completely<00:04:48.740> dry<00:04:48.920> and<00:04:49.370> rinse<00:04:49.610> it<00:04:49.760> off<00:04:49.910> and<00:04:50.360> then

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
completely dry and rinse it off and then

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.980 
completely dry and rinse it off and then
come<00:04:51.140> back<00:04:51.410> and<00:04:51.830> your<00:04:52.580> spiders<00:04:53.090> should<00:04:53.360> be<00:04:53.570> dry

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
come back and your spiders should be dry
