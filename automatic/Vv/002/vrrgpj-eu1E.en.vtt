00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:15.980
 was the southern state of the south is more 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.070
 they forgot about me 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:22.220
 I'm going to teach you coffee today. 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.400
 a good coffee and a coffee to learn how to 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:28.430
 be trodden coffee with milk also good 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:37.540
 but kull buys fucking and wisconsin 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:39.890
 paid to appreciate things from within 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:50.410
 impact you spend a bit of 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:53.870
 detergent James shakes more slowly than 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.460
 There is a stop that if it breaks, it's over. 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.960
 because I have to know neither 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:02.739
 To pay like this is good to do the same 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.739
 thing that could 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.150
 It will take a lot of stomach from inside to 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.640
 take this foam is water you leave 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.330
 water rose 3 to 8 from the foam and 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.330
 get sweaty 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.700
 putting the bottle down because the 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.810
 bottle usually we use 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.870
 mug 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.720
 that big deal with him caused 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.369
 Just make the difference from here to this. 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.270
 panela that is that he has a pout 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:40.640
 here seriously, same way to do it 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:46.270
 to heat because now that the water 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.270
 late for pouring button use it gave 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:54.970
 this also indicates that if you see smoke 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.970
 you need to put a light on the 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:00.440
 The secret here is that the water in the 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.140
 can be 100 degrees 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.880
 actually the best temperature for the 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.270
 inclusion of coffee and internet research 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.660
 several places in 36 points seven to the 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:15.080
 98 Â° something like that but anyway it's not 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:18.080
 boiling water why leave the pt because 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.209
 I'm on the plateau a thousand feet above the 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.930
 sea â€‹â€‹level so the pressure here is 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.350
 smaller 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.150
 water boils at lower temperatures 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.820
 curiously the temperature that the water 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.910
 loses here in Brazil is 96 grains 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.769
 so if you live at sea level you have 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.110
 to let her see you and take one 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.250
 bit of the body to download a 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.630
 little temperature but only one 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.070
 a little 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.040
 This will make what your coffee has is 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:45.110
 Do you take away all the coffee? 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.299
 You will not burn coffee and cocoa coffee. 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.959
 and will get very loved will put more 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:55.549
 sugar will not work 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:58.010
 the sugar is half the size of the bottle 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:05.180
 and tie in a pint and a half 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:15.040
 so I use 17 6 scoops with an email 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:15.040
 by 2 to 0 7 5 and 7 women 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.580
 there are not three tablespoons are 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:37.850
 transcribed coffee that his mother was 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:41.810
 This the big laac the spoon is going to get 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:44.510
 dirty then boots up threw up 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.350
 for a panel with the conceptions 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.350
 dipped in water 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:17.260
 let's teach you how to do the best 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:25.770
 Place the world a cup recipe 200 ml 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:25.770
 this here has 400 so put half 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:35.289
 because it's important to try milk I do not know 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.760
 but the dripping gets better with 6 5th milk 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:38.139
 it's no use trying microwave milk and 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:42.039
 It gets better when it warms up 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:49.330
 spoon a spoonful of sugar for milk 1 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:53.500
 spoon athletic coffee we will 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:58.830
 heat in the coffee very end will 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:05:02.740
 get soaking wet 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:04.570
 You can sing your bottle and not 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.780
 cool the rest of the coffee because of these 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.860
 droplets that are falling 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.800
 It's good to put a transparent glass 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:15.340
 because then you will see when you finish 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:18.310
 pines is ready 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:22.650
 how to know if you are not leaking with a 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.650
 little water and back cover 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:29.400
 if there is no bubble, it is because 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:33.479
 was always wearing close to the ear 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:38.889
 you will hear the noise of the fenasan 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:42.030
 Warm up and not only did you get warm 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:42.030
 put milk on your lap 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:54.870
 and then the ratio is 80% milk to 20 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:54.870
 percent and coffee has to be very clear 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:14.620
 put a transparent glass each 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:16.240
 see the other tip is kind dont put all 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.590
 hot milk and once you can 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:21.700
 put some cold milk to 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:25.420
 measure the temperature you like yourself 

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:29.430
 Did you like it already, do not you share it? 

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:29.430

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:40.939
