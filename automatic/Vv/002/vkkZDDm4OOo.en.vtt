you on camera here Maurice is gonna put

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.480 
you on camera here Maurice is gonna put
her<00:01:50.240> head<00:01:50.450> up<00:01:50.630> Maurice<00:01:51.380> has<00:01:51.619> a<00:01:51.649> cold<00:01:51.950> glass<00:01:52.220> on

her head up Maurice has a cold glass on
the<00:01:52.610> skin<00:01:52.880> and<00:01:53.000> as<00:01:53.090> I<00:01:53.210> just<00:01:53.420> pulsed<00:01:53.810> a<00:01:53.869> laser

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
the skin and as I just pulsed a laser

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.420 
the skin and as I just pulsed a laser
there's<00:01:54.380> gonna<00:01:54.470> be<00:01:54.619> a<00:01:54.649> little<00:01:54.860> beam<00:01:55.039> of<00:01:55.190> green

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
there's gonna be a little beam of green

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.550 
there's gonna be a little beam of green
light<00:01:55.670> did<00:01:56.060> you<00:01:56.180> feel<00:01:56.330> that<00:01:56.509> I<00:01:56.750> did<00:01:57.080> good

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
light did you feel that I did good

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.340 
light did you feel that I did good
what<00:01:57.710> does<00:01:57.800> it<00:01:57.920> feel<00:01:57.950> like<00:01:58.130> like<00:01:59.000> a<00:01:59.030> pinch<00:01:59.420> does

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
what does it feel like like a pinch does

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.999 
what does it feel like like a pinch does
it<00:02:00.470> hurt<00:02:01.090> not<00:02:02.090> yet<00:02:04.300> and<00:02:05.300> how<00:02:05.690> long<00:02:05.960> will<00:02:06.740> the

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
it hurt not yet and how long will the

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.910 
it hurt not yet and how long will the
results<00:02:07.580> from<00:02:07.880> this<00:02:08.090> last<00:02:08.570> it<00:02:09.289> lasted<00:02:09.350> at

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
results from this last it lasted at

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.680 
results from this last it lasted at
least<00:02:10.280> a<00:02:10.429> year<00:02:10.459> for<00:02:10.820> a<00:02:10.880> lot<00:02:11.000> of<00:02:11.030> people<00:02:11.480> can

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
least a year for a lot of people can

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.600 
least a year for a lot of people can
last<00:02:11.900> longer<00:02:12.170> and<00:02:12.560> as<00:02:12.830> people<00:02:13.040> make<00:02:13.250> new<00:02:13.400> blood

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
last longer and as people make new blood

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.220 
last longer and as people make new blood
vessels<00:02:13.970> and<00:02:14.180> we<00:02:14.269> just<00:02:14.450> touch<00:02:14.630> those<00:02:14.870> up<00:02:15.049> also

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
vessels and we just touch those up also

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.530 
vessels and we just touch those up also
now<00:02:15.769> I<00:02:15.980> realize<00:02:16.489> it<00:02:16.730> really<00:02:16.910> depends<00:02:17.420> on

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
now I realize it really depends on

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.479 
now I realize it really depends on
case-to-case<00:02:18.110> and<00:02:18.769> how<00:02:18.920> many<00:02:19.190> blood<00:02:19.459> vessels

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
case-to-case and how many blood vessels

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.640 
case-to-case and how many blood vessels
right<00:02:19.940> tree<00:02:20.269> but<00:02:20.480> what's<00:02:20.959> sort<00:02:21.200> of<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.350> cost

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
right tree but what's sort of the cost

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.650 
right tree but what's sort of the cost
range<00:02:22.130> for<00:02:22.459> a<00:02:22.489> person<00:02:22.820> that<00:02:22.850> would<00:02:23.030> go<00:02:23.180> in<00:02:23.360> for

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
range for a person that would go in for

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.250 
range for a person that would go in for
say<00:02:24.440> three<00:02:24.709> treatments<00:02:25.160> absolutely<00:02:25.730> so<00:02:25.940> uh

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
say three treatments absolutely so uh

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.060 
say three treatments absolutely so uh
unfortunately<00:02:27.260> this<00:02:27.410> is<00:02:27.590> not<00:02:27.739> something

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
unfortunately this is not something

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.500 
unfortunately this is not something

pinch or like a rubber band yes kind of
thing<00:02:47.180> something<00:02:47.720> like<00:02:47.870> that<00:02:48.049> in<00:02:48.320> reach<00:02:48.530> I

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
thing something like that in reach I

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.350 
thing something like that in reach I
don't<00:02:48.860> know<00:02:48.920> if<00:02:49.010> you<00:02:49.130> can<00:02:49.280> see<00:02:49.549> this<00:02:49.700> but<00:02:49.940> we've

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
don't know if you can see this but we've

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.509 
don't know if you can see this but we've
just<00:02:50.600> treated<00:02:50.930> this<00:02:51.019> whole<00:02:51.260> area<00:02:51.680> you<00:02:52.250> didn't

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
just treated this whole area you didn't

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.130 
just treated this whole area you didn't
kind<00:02:52.700> of<00:02:52.880> see<00:02:53.090> sure<00:02:53.329> in<00:02:53.480> your<00:02:53.570> face<00:02:53.840> there's

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
kind of see sure in your face there's

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.630 
kind of see sure in your face there's
blood<00:02:54.500> vessels<00:02:54.950> have<00:02:55.130> just<00:02:55.400> melted

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
blood vessels have just melted

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:05.470 
blood vessels have just melted
we<00:02:59.170> treated<00:03:03.280> happening<00:03:04.280> where<00:03:04.790> that<00:03:05.180> just

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
we treated happening where that just

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.940 
we treated happening where that just
goes<00:03:05.780> away<00:03:06.019> like<00:03:06.319> what's<00:03:06.530> literally

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
goes away like what's literally

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.740 
goes away like what's literally
happening<00:03:07.370> to<00:03:07.519> the<00:03:07.640> skin<00:03:07.910> what<00:03:08.150> happens<00:03:08.569> is

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
happening to the skin what happens is

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.360 
happening to the skin what happens is
that<00:03:08.780> the<00:03:09.050> blood<00:03:09.290> vessels<00:03:09.650> absorb<00:03:10.010> the<00:03:10.160> laser

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
that the blood vessels absorb the laser

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.430 
that the blood vessels absorb the laser
energy<00:03:10.519> and<00:03:11.480> that<00:03:11.629> heats<00:03:11.870> up<00:03:12.019> those<00:03:12.230> blood

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
energy and that heats up those blood

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.140 
energy and that heats up those blood
vessels<00:03:12.470> and<00:03:12.920> then<00:03:13.040> our<00:03:13.130> body<00:03:13.280> resorbs<00:03:13.970> them

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
vessels and then our body resorbs them

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.580 
vessels and then our body resorbs them
so<00:03:14.330> it's<00:03:14.480> really<00:03:14.630> the<00:03:14.840> best<00:03:14.870> way<00:03:15.140> to<00:03:15.260> get<00:03:15.470> rid

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
so it's really the best way to get rid

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.199 
so it's really the best way to get rid
of<00:03:15.620> blood<00:03:15.830> vessels<00:03:16.160> and<00:03:16.280> it<00:03:16.430> happens<00:03:16.910> like

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
of blood vessels and it happens like

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.690 
of blood vessels and it happens like
amedeo<00:03:17.870> quick<00:03:18.319> yeah<00:03:18.470> yeah<00:03:18.890> it's<00:03:19.160> really<00:03:19.459> it's

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
amedeo quick yeah yeah it's really it's

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.309 
amedeo quick yeah yeah it's really it's
really<00:03:19.940> good<00:03:20.090> fun<00:03:20.390> now<00:03:20.599> that<00:03:20.630> you<00:03:20.840> know<00:03:21.050> that

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319 
really good fun now that you know that

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:22.390
