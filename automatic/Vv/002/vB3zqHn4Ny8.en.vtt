know where the hell I was so I could get

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:19.250 
know where the hell I was so I could get
to<00:03:18.390> where<00:03:18.480> I<00:03:18.540> need<00:03:18.750> to<00:03:18.780> go

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
to where I need to go

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.680 
to where I need to go
ie<00:03:19.440> San<00:03:19.800> Jose<00:03:20.100> something<00:03:21.030> in<00:03:21.150> this<00:03:21.209> experiment

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
ie San Jose something in this experiment

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.390 
ie San Jose something in this experiment
is<00:03:21.750> turning<00:03:21.989> into<00:03:22.140> a<00:03:22.260> bit<00:03:22.410> of<00:03:22.440> a<00:03:22.530> washout<00:03:22.709> half

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
is turning into a bit of a washout half

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.800 
is turning into a bit of a washout half
the<00:03:23.519> answers<00:03:23.790> either<00:03:23.970> didn't<00:03:24.300> make<00:03:24.420> sense<00:03:24.690> so

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
the answers either didn't make sense so

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.420 
the answers either didn't make sense so
it<00:03:24.870> made<00:03:25.019> me<00:03:25.110> feel<00:03:25.290> bad<00:03:25.410> about<00:03:25.470> myself<00:03:25.800> so<00:03:26.310> it's

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
it made me feel bad about myself so it's

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.009 
it made me feel bad about myself so it's
safe<00:03:26.580> to<00:03:26.700> say<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:27.090> in<00:03:27.239> conclusion<00:03:27.660> to<00:03:27.930> our

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
safe to say the in conclusion to our
