00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.570
 but 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:09.570
 hey that the frog rené is here but 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.640
 no, it's not that they're going to see me, it's great 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.330
 the craft are going to feel lizards 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:17.890
 we're ready alone so let's see 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.350
 the list of materials 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:24.700
 to renew your jacket you need a 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:28.890
 jacket with felt hat scissors 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:31.540
 gun and bars of silicon clay 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.490
 Martin when you go to the gym that everything 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.040
 the world sees you as one more in the 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.370
 example nobody peels me I went through the 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.370
 hallways 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.600
 very very dedicated good because with this 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.130
 that we are going to make a transformation to 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.580
 your city was this you take to 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:50.140
 gym will know who does not turn you 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.460
 go and how are we going to do it 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.970
 look, I want to make some triangles 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:59.059
 here we already have advance some 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:02.960
 prelates uars which is the simplest 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:05.850
 let's mark what we can do with 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.840
 Regulate if about 7 centimeters 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.840
 let's go cutting 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.420
 you know it's very good to use different 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:19.100
 felt types different colors for 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:21.080
 to give more life to our design 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.210
 and I can be a very good idea to 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.150
 any day of the weeks that also 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.619
 the colored weapons draw or until 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.430
 for the disguise or it occurs to me that 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:33.649
 any romper that has smooth if not 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.729
 it's smooth so we can also do in 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:41.000
 is in this same form and what we are going 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:43.670
 to go doing is to take one and one the 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.220
 let's take and paste and here for example 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:51.319
 we are going to follow as we did 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:53.479
 here we bring the ones that we join the unimos 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:56.659
 a clear with a dark 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:59.600
 we start by sticking the fingers of 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:04.490
 ends leaving one then we take 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:06.500
 one and one here you can go using it 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.019
 of the same color because they are the ones that 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.530
 they have the same form can also be 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:14.860
 so much is good is perfect 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:19.480
 to go taking a pencil they keep counting 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.480
 we are going to stick two of the sides 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.450
 We can also make a shark 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.450
 soon if they do not want 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:33.160
 and Marist 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.300
 there is the shark took it 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:42.670
 shark 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:46.030
 it does not seem without cockroach wave a 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:49.390
 cockroach this from the cockroach vessel 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:52.180
 and there it is early to find check 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:55.450
 then we go a dark one clear and so 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:58.690
 as it is important alternating that 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:02.320
 so stick the edges 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:05.680
 and then we have one of the parts of the 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:08.650
 triangle without pasting then there is 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:14.620
 let's leave it below and that's it 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:17.650
 that goes on then the sweatshirt che that yes 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.480
 I'm going to help you by sticking and 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:23.470
 what I do is paste it inside 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.470
 so that no 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.940
 if we do it straight in the sweatshirt 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.890
 because suddenly it is not exactly 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.640
 where we want it here instead what 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.430
 Let's do is like hugging 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.410
 the part that we want to join and remember 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.650
 that the recommendation will always be to sew 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.600
 on top of doing one pass on this 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.490
 matter since we are saving 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.860

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:29.669

 elaboration cut the felt pairs of 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:39.660
 triangles of different sizes and 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:41.970
 colors stick them together leaving in the 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:44.250
 base a tab since it will serve 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.750
 to stick it your jacket accommodates the 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.699
 triangles in line form from the 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:51.249
 cap to the waist for the part of 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:54.669
 back to create a dinosaur look 

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:56.569
 almost martino and emotional and I 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:06:00.550

 it gives me less to more nor a scale 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:12.930
 they can call scales of the dinosaurs 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:16.290
 we are not even a palette not suitcases with 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:18.630
 suitcase then well no more peak of 

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:22.610
 Munich or less then I'm going to 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:24.760
 investigate about having a party 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:28.800

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:43.120
 little girl so that I already like that 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:46.810
 you humble yourself and do like that in the 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:50.850
 tyrannosaurus so what do you think if 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:50.850
