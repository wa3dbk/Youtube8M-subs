00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.029 

well<00:01:26.670> there<00:01:27.060> was<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.600> few<00:01:28.049> groups<00:01:28.380> unlike<00:01:28.829> the

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:29.039 
well there was a few groups unlike the

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:31.310 
well there was a few groups unlike the
best<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.549> this<00:01:30.149> the<00:01:30.450> decision<00:01:30.899> for<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.110> first

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
best and this the decision for the first

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.230 
best and this the decision for the first
place<00:01:31.560> for<00:01:31.740> me<00:01:31.890> was<00:01:32.070> almost<00:01:32.280> like<00:01:32.579> doing<00:01:32.759> this

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.669 

so<00:01:36.240> it's<00:01:36.390> almost<00:01:36.570> impossible<00:01:36.960> there's<00:01:37.469> two

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:37.679 
so it's almost impossible there's two

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:39.230 
so it's almost impossible there's two
groups<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.159> had<00:01:38.369> just<00:01:38.610> what<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:38.789> was<00:01:38.939> talking

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
groups that had just what I was talking

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.510 
groups that had just what I was talking
about<00:01:39.299> one<00:01:40.200> group<00:01:40.469> was<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.799> little<00:01:41.100> younger<00:01:41.340> I

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
about one group was a little younger I

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.880 
about one group was a little younger I
think<00:01:41.640> had<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:41.970> little<00:01:42.240> more<00:01:42.360> hunger<00:01:42.840> while<00:01:43.649> the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
think had a little more hunger while the

Clarence dieter for me dancing is

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.870 
Clarence dieter for me dancing is
because<00:03:28.960> music<00:03:29.290> music<00:03:29.650> comes<00:03:29.770> first<00:03:30.040> but<00:03:30.700> then

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
because music music comes first but then

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.070 
because music music comes first but then
also<00:03:31.060> you<00:03:31.330> have<00:03:31.360> to<00:03:31.690> rely<00:03:31.960> on<00:03:33.570> the<00:03:34.570> movement

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
also you have to rely on the movement

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.990 
also you have to rely on the movement
and<00:03:35.260> the<00:03:35.380> choreography<00:03:35.890> for<00:03:36.490> example<00:03:36.850> if<00:03:36.910> we

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
and the choreography for example if we

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.700 
and the choreography for example if we
move<00:03:37.030> further<00:03:37.450> on<00:03:37.690> to<00:03:37.810> today<00:03:38.110> where<00:03:38.350> there

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:38.710 
move further on to today where there

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.920 
move further on to today where there
were<00:03:38.800> the<00:03:39.010> solos<00:03:39.460> where<00:03:40.180> people<00:03:40.450> freestyle<00:03:40.900> a

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
were the solos where people freestyle a

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.930 
were the solos where people freestyle a
lot<00:03:41.140> that's<00:03:41.770> the<00:03:41.980> first<00:03:42.280> thing<00:03:42.430> I<00:03:42.520> look<00:03:42.640> at<00:03:42.760> the

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
lot that's the first thing I look at the

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.700 
lot that's the first thing I look at the
musicality<00:03:43.420> obviously<00:03:44.140> the<00:03:44.260> choreography<00:03:44.620> it

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:44.710 
musicality obviously the choreography it

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.520 
musicality obviously the choreography it
needs<00:03:44.890> to<00:03:44.980> be<00:03:45.070> the<00:03:45.190> same<00:03:45.400> if<00:03:45.700> the<00:03:46.320> routine<00:03:47.320> is

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
needs to be the same if the routine is

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.680 
needs to be the same if the routine is
not<00:03:47.710> connected<00:03:48.220> with<00:03:48.340> the<00:03:48.400> music<00:03:48.760> it<00:03:49.330> doesn't

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
not connected with the music it doesn't

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.270 
not connected with the music it doesn't
really<00:03:49.930> make<00:03:50.110> sense<00:03:50.140> I<00:03:50.470> wouldn't<00:03:50.890> feel<00:03:51.040> it<00:03:51.220> I

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
really make sense I wouldn't feel it I

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.500 
really make sense I wouldn't feel it I
don't<00:03:51.430> think<00:03:51.490> the<00:03:51.670> audience<00:03:51.820> would<00:03:52.150> feel<00:03:52.300> it

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
don't think the audience would feel it

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.930 
don't think the audience would feel it
so<00:03:53.200> that's<00:03:53.770> really<00:03:53.920> important<00:03:54.550> and<00:03:54.670> then<00:03:54.910> I

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
so that's really important and then I

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.350 
so that's really important and then I
think<00:03:55.710> costume<00:03:56.710> wise<00:03:56.950> what<00:03:57.220> they<00:03:57.340> wear<00:03:57.580> also

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
think costume wise what they wear also

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.910 
think costume wise what they wear also
puts<00:03:58.630> a<00:03:58.810> lot<00:03:59.050> it<00:03:59.260> shouldn't<00:03:59.680> be<00:03:59.740> that

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
puts a lot it shouldn't be that

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.370 
puts a lot it shouldn't be that
important<00:04:00.400> but<00:04:00.490> it<00:04:00.610> makes<00:04:00.820> it<00:04:00.970> easier<00:04:01.420> to<00:04:01.480> to

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
important but it makes it easier to to

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.190 
important but it makes it easier to to
see<00:04:02.590> what<00:04:02.620> they<00:04:02.860> want<00:04:03.250> to<00:04:03.430> make<00:04:04.330> us<00:04:04.540> feel<00:04:04.840> or

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200
