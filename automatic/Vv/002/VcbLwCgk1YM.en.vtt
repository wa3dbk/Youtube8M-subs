00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.720
 In response to the peace we did to show visitors 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.099
 Another remote wing of this religious right saying people choose to be gay 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.519
 I got a message from an anonymous source David Pakman showing the viewer means I know who 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:15.589
 It is but I save your identity which he said 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:20.090
 I'm gay and I chose to be gay I have never gotten a letter like this before 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.789
 She did a summary of David 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:25.260
 I am sixty years old gay man outside my country since the mid twenties 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.449
 Until that time I have enjoyed emotional and physical relationships with several 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:30.070
 For women 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.210
 I also had some sexual interest in men that I sought 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.600
 Partly out of curiosity and partly to avoid 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.649
 The children had gay relationships and then became better 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:46.230
 I really think I had an option in this matter as much as I support gay rights 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.010
 I think an exception to a lot of groups that strongly insist gay gays 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.710
 All gays are born as such for some may be true for many of my others 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.329
 Experience has taught me that it is the chosen behavior 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.719
 Regardless of why someone is gay people try to defend their sexual orientation 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.260
 Insisting we have no choice 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.369
 My arm must stop 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.340
 I am fascinated by this because if we look at language 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.180
 There is no sign here that it was an option to be attracted to men 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.299
 Let's be very clear you can choose 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.409
 About whether or not to engage in emotional or sexual relationships 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.640
 With a man with a woman with all of with no not this is the same thing 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.189
 Make a choice about who you find yourself attracted to even when you are 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:31.890
 I say 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.079
 I enjoyed emotional and physical relationships with women 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:40.049
 I also had some sexual interest in men you did not choose 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.899
 Be this attention you have chosen to follow or not to continue the relationship 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.320
 When I read this Lewis 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.040
 I read the story of a bisexual person 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.720
 This is exactly what I got for me so I mean the point is when you are attracted 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.500
 To someone 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.340
 It will not be your choice and when you are attracted to you 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.240
 Well I do not want to tell you that he can not be happy together 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.930
 The other thing is that the message does not say 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.489
 For any number of reasons it may not say that 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.890
 You attract only women 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.270
 And then it became to attract men or vice versa or you still attract 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.140
 For women or anyway it may be 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.200
 It seems here that your choices are made 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.239
 It was with regard to the super-sex those who want to be in relationships 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:30.739
 Referred 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.560
 Not those who do not have no choice about attraction 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.290
 By the way they really are men in a row 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.800
 I have met them in my life who have sex with men 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.780
 Instead of simply avoiding women to have children I mean you know 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.060
 Lewis said so not interested in the baby 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.540
 If he was accidentally a kid he probably loved a child 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.540
 But to avoid having children Lewis does not say 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.730
 Maybe I'll just have sex with men and in other words it has to be 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:59.519
 I planted seeds 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.290
 With the attraction of man so Louis I find this letter to be wonderful though 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.830
 I will go 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.560
 Only the vocabulary and language used here 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.940
 This letter is a guide is the person who is probably bisexual 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.739
 Or gay choices may be made simply about who he wanted to pursue 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:17.849
 Relationships with 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.090
 Writing in the case of this person 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.400
 I mean you're so attracted to all that you're the best we did your cucumber was fine 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.180
 Those that I do not want to go with 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.220
 But many people and I do not have this option because of their attraction to one 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.830
 Or others 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.170
 Send me your thoughts on this letter I know I will hear from 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.830
 The person who wrote me this letter 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.620
 I hope to hear from others is also a theoretical analysis 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.250
 Is there anything in this letter that really indicates that this is 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.920
 The individual who chose 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.010
 Be gay instead of making a decision 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.080
 About the relationships he had wanted to pursue 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.790
 In my way off on this I am right sending me your thoughts I am very curious to hear 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:57.629
 Of people 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:01.900
 I am also very curious to learn how many new members we will have before 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.019
 Once we go 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:07.640
