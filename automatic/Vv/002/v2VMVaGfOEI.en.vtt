machines<00:00:09.170> the<00:00:10.170> bug<00:00:11.010> bit<00:00:11.309> me<00:00:11.340> and<00:00:11.519> I<00:00:11.759> thought

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
machines the bug bit me and I thought

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.110 
machines the bug bit me and I thought
I'd<00:00:12.469> give<00:00:13.469> it<00:00:13.500> a<00:00:13.679> shot<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.250> I<00:00:14.580> think<00:00:14.790> I've<00:00:14.940> come

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
I'd give it a shot and I think I've come

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.609 
I'd give it a shot and I think I've come
up<00:00:15.150> with<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.450> contraption<00:00:15.719> that<00:00:16.080> actually

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
up with a contraption that actually

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.390 
up with a contraption that actually
works<00:00:16.859> fairly<00:00:17.430> well<00:00:18.380> we've<00:00:19.380> got<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.710> flywheel

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
works fairly well we've got the flywheel

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.939 
works fairly well we've got the flywheel
from<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.789> NordicTrack<00:00:21.150> there<00:00:21.769> and<00:00:22.769> I'm<00:00:22.830> gonna

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
from the NordicTrack there and I'm gonna

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.920 
from the NordicTrack there and I'm gonna
get<00:00:23.130> some<00:00:23.160> close-ups<00:00:23.850> because<00:00:24.300> all<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.570> had<00:00:24.810> to

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
get some close-ups because all I had to

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.509 
get some close-ups because all I had to
go<00:00:24.960> on<00:00:25.230> when<00:00:25.380> I<00:00:25.410> built<00:00:25.680> mine<00:00:25.890> was<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.340> couple

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
go on when I built mine was a couple

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.810 
go on when I built mine was a couple
pictures<00:00:26.820> from<00:00:27.180> other<00:00:27.330> people's<00:00:27.779> online<00:00:28.380> and

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
pictures from other people's online and

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.659 
pictures from other people's online and
and<00:00:29.820> left<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.179> lot<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.510> figure<00:00:30.750> out<00:00:30.900> on<00:00:31.050> my<00:00:31.080> own

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:31.669 
and left a lot to figure out on my own

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.959 
and left a lot to figure out on my own
but<00:00:32.669> these<00:00:32.940> are<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.450> rubber<00:00:34.170> rollers<00:00:34.969> that

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
but these are the rubber rollers that

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.459 
but these are the rubber rollers that
the<00:00:36.090> skis<00:00:36.390> would<00:00:36.600> ride<00:00:36.840> on<00:00:36.989> on<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.290> North

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
the skis would ride on on the North

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.639 
the skis would ride on on the North
track<00:00:37.860> there's<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.879> pulley<00:00:39.180> here<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.960> boy<00:00:40.620> I

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
track there's a pulley here and boy I

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.080 
track there's a pulley here and boy I
scoured<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.250> internet<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.820> didn't<00:00:42.030> know

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
scoured the internet and didn't know

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.760 
scoured the internet and didn't know
what<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.300> was<00:00:42.390> going<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.600> do<00:00:42.780> there<00:00:43.050> those<00:00:43.590> are

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
what I was going to do there those are

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.680 
what I was going to do there those are
actually<00:00:44.070> rollers<00:00:44.520> for<00:00:44.850> boat<00:00:45.059> trailers<00:00:45.539> the

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
actually rollers for boat trailers the

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.180 
actually rollers for boat trailers the
bottle<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.079> people's<00:00:46.410> boats<00:00:46.680> would<00:00:46.920> go<00:00:47.039> on

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
bottle of people's boats would go on

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.340 
bottle of people's boats would go on
that<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.489> roll<00:00:47.610> up<00:00:47.640> on<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.030> boat<00:00:48.270> three<00:00:49.170> inch

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
that and roll up on the boat three inch

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.279 
that and roll up on the boat three inch
so<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:49.680> use<00:00:49.920> those<00:00:50.190> worked<00:00:50.489> out<00:00:50.670> well<00:00:51.020> and<00:00:52.020> the

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
so I use those worked out well and the

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.590 
so I use those worked out well and the
rest<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.800> just<00:00:52.829> kind<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.430> figured<00:00:54.180> out<00:00:54.329> as<00:00:54.480> I

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
rest I just kind of figured out as I

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.610 
rest I just kind of figured out as I
went<00:00:54.899> this<00:00:56.570> man<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:57.930> see<00:00:58.170> here<00:00:58.379> this<00:00:58.559> is

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
went this man that you see here this is

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.240 
went this man that you see here this is
the<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.250> tensioner<00:00:59.820> I<00:01:00.559> can<00:01:01.559> tighten<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:02.039> or

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
the the tensioner I can tighten that or

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.219 
the the tensioner I can tighten that or
loosen<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.699> put<00:01:02.910> more<00:01:03.120> or<00:01:03.270> less<00:01:03.449> resistance<00:01:04.049> on

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
loosen it put more or less resistance on

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.410 
loosen it put more or less resistance on
it<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.500> simulate<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:05.280> know<00:01:05.400> power<00:01:05.670> strokes<00:01:06.180> or

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
it to simulate you know power strokes or

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.460 
it to simulate you know power strokes or
easy<00:01:06.630> paddling<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:08.000> seat<00:01:09.200> this<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.260> the

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
easy paddling a seat this is the

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.120 
easy paddling a seat this is the
footrest<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.189> designed<00:01:12.500> now<00:01:13.500> you'll<00:01:13.770> notice<00:01:13.979> a

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
footrest I designed now you'll notice a

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.160 
footrest I designed now you'll notice a
couple<00:01:14.159> things<00:01:14.430> about<00:01:14.790> this<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:15.840> used<00:01:16.049> a

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
couple things about this is I used a

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.600 
couple things about this is I used a
couple<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.560> parts<00:01:16.740> from<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.130> old<00:01:17.250> Nordic

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
couple of the parts from the old Nordic

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.670 
couple of the parts from the old Nordic
Track<00:01:17.850> machines<00:01:18.390> it's<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.750> people<00:01:19.439> little

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
Track machines it's a people little

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.149 
Track machines it's a people little
authenticity<00:01:20.310> there<00:01:21.200> but<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.229> also<00:01:22.350> thought<00:01:23.040> it

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
authenticity there but I also thought it

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.590 
authenticity there but I also thought it
would<00:01:23.250> be<00:01:23.340> kind<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.610> neat<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.909> simulate<00:01:24.119> one<00:01:24.479> of

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
would be kind of neat to simulate one of

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.660 
would be kind of neat to simulate one of
my<00:01:24.689> actual<00:01:25.020> kayaks<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:26.100> foot<00:01:26.340> bar<00:01:26.549> is

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
my actual kayaks so this foot bar is

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.649 
my actual kayaks so this foot bar is
like<00:01:26.790> seven<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.540> half<00:01:27.570> inches<00:01:28.049> high<00:01:28.110> and

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
like seven and a half inches high and

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.240 
like seven and a half inches high and
it's<00:01:30.659> got<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.869> tiller<00:01:31.170> bar<00:01:31.380> for<00:01:31.650> tiller<00:01:32.040> bar

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
it's got a tiller bar for tiller bar

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.819 
it's got a tiller bar for tiller bar
steering<00:01:32.759> here<00:01:32.970> as<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.420> can<00:01:33.479> see<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:34.079> that's

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
steering here as you can see and that's

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.950 
steering here as you can see and that's
exactly<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.640> dimensions<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.509> setup<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:36.930> have

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
exactly the dimensions and setup I have

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.429 
exactly the dimensions and setup I have
in<00:01:37.229> my<00:01:37.350> Thunderbolt<00:01:37.829> X<00:01:38.040> kayak<00:01:38.520> so<00:01:39.360> when<00:01:40.320> I'm

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
in my Thunderbolt X kayak so when I'm

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.410 
in my Thunderbolt X kayak so when I'm
doing<00:01:40.680> my<00:01:40.710> work<00:01:40.829> out<00:01:41.220> here<00:01:41.460> I'll<00:01:42.150> have<00:01:42.299> the

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
doing my work out here I'll have the

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.840 
doing my work out here I'll have the
same<00:01:42.720> foot<00:01:43.079> feel<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.829> tiller<00:01:44.100> bar<00:01:44.280> steering

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
same foot feel and tiller bar steering

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.080 
same foot feel and tiller bar steering
although<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.659> don't<00:01:45.840> think<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.729> machine<00:01:47.729> is

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
although I don't think this machine is

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.749 
although I don't think this machine is
gonna<00:01:48.270> steer<00:01:48.689> very<00:01:48.720> well<00:01:49.399> and<00:01:50.399> then<00:01:50.520> in<00:01:50.670> the

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
gonna steer very well and then in the

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.109 
gonna steer very well and then in the
back<00:01:50.970> here<00:01:51.329> it's<00:01:51.540> just<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.930> long<00:01:52.170> piece<00:01:53.119> piece

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
back here it's just a long piece piece

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.749 
back here it's just a long piece piece

will hold up fold down and I made a

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.740 
will hold up fold down and I made a
little<00:01:59.369> curvature<00:01:59.969> on<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.210> back<00:02:00.390> here<00:02:00.659> and

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
little curvature on the back here and

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.649 
little curvature on the back here and
I'll<00:02:00.869> explain<00:02:00.899> more<00:02:01.439> about<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:02.509> after<00:02:03.509> the

of<00:03:19.910> redesigning<00:03:20.449> things<00:03:20.810> on<00:03:21.019> the<00:03:21.139> fly<00:03:21.379> and

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
of redesigning things on the fly and

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.259 
of redesigning things on the fly and
figuring<00:03:22.069> things<00:03:22.099> out<00:03:22.459> as<00:03:22.699> you<00:03:22.879> go<00:03:23.030> because

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
figuring things out as you go because

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.750 
figuring things out as you go because
there<00:03:23.510> are<00:03:23.599> no<00:03:23.720> plans<00:03:24.019> that<00:03:24.199> exists<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:25.639> it

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
there are no plans that exists and it

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.699 
there are no plans that exists and it
took<00:03:26.060> me<00:03:26.239> quite<00:03:26.269> a<00:03:26.540> while<00:03:26.660> to<00:03:26.840> to<00:03:27.349> figure<00:03:27.530> out

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
took me quite a while to to figure out

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.349 
took me quite a while to to figure out
especially<00:03:27.889> the<00:03:28.190> pulley<00:03:28.489> system<00:03:28.970> underneath

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
especially the pulley system underneath

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:32.199 
especially the pulley system underneath
maybe<00:03:29.660> I'll<00:03:29.870> flip<00:03:30.349> it<00:03:30.470> over<00:03:30.620> in<00:03:30.799> part<00:03:31.069> two<00:03:31.310> but

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
maybe I'll flip it over in part two but

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:33.789 
maybe I'll flip it over in part two but
it's<00:03:32.359> got<00:03:32.510> some<00:03:32.750> elaborate<00:03:33.079> pulleys<00:03:33.650> and

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
it's got some elaborate pulleys and

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:36.970 
it's got some elaborate pulleys and
Springs<00:03:34.190> to<00:03:34.400> keep<00:03:34.549> tensions<00:03:35.030> in<00:03:35.180> the<00:03:35.269> rope<00:03:35.980> it

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
Springs to keep tensions in the rope it

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.619 
Springs to keep tensions in the rope it
was<00:03:37.220> not<00:03:37.430> easy<00:03:37.579> to<00:03:37.790> figure<00:03:37.970> out<00:03:38.090> but<00:03:38.389> I<00:03:38.449> got

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:38.629 
was not easy to figure out but I got

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:40.270 
was not easy to figure out but I got
through<00:03:38.930> it<00:03:38.959> and<00:03:39.169> I'm<00:03:39.470> pretty<00:03:39.709> happy<00:03:39.829> with<00:03:40.220> the

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
through it and I'm pretty happy with the

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:47.740 
through it and I'm pretty happy with the
result<00:03:40.699> here<00:03:40.940> all<00:03:41.780> right<00:03:42.019> kayak<00:03:42.470> urgh<00:03:46.419> okay<00:03:47.419> in

result here all right kayak urgh okay in
the<00:03:48.019> first<00:03:48.260> segment<00:03:48.650> I<00:03:49.099> told<00:03:49.609> you<00:03:49.760> I<00:03:49.819> would<00:03:49.970> get
