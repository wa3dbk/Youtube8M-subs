 help from a spoon let's mix 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.620
 until it dissolves completely 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:07.040
 once dissolved, let's go 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.990
 adding the fresh yeast and then 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.950
 we will remove until it is completely 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.950
 integrated 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.770
 next we are going to take the egg and 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.070
 in a separate bowl let's beat it a 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.070
 little bit 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.290
 yes 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.610
 once we have the beaten egg we are going to 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.720
 add it to the previous mix and let's 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.850
 stir 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.880
 and when we have it ready, what 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:47.160
 we reserve on the other hand in a bowl 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.160
 big let's go hoisting the flour 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.470
 yes 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:00.390
 Once sieved we add the sugar and the 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.159
 teaspoon of salt and with the help of a 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.789
 spoon we mix a little 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.500
 and then we will add the 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:09.340
 tulip margarine and with the help of 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.640
 our hands 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.870
 let's go mixing the flour 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.910
 when the margarine has been mixed 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.879
 well with all the flour and that of lumps 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.769
 or we 'll have it ready now with help 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:22.959
 of a spatula let's make a hole 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:25.299
 in the center of the flour and let's go 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.019
 adding the liquid mixture that we just 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:28.019
 To prepare 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.140
 when we have added all the liquid 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.910
 we will also add the orange blossom water and 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.040
 the orange zest and let's go 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.520
 mixing until it becomes us 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.520
 a mass 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.650
 yes 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.160
 when you see that you can no longer work the 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.350
 mass the overturned on your bank of 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.350
 previously floured work and the dough 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.560
 You know that the dough is ready when and 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.959
 do not stick our work bench and 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.700
 there is a fine mass at that time the 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.560
 We fly a little and we're going to 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.590
 enter in a bowl previously 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.360
 smeared with oil we cover it and we go 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:25.130
 to let stand for one hour 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.130
 approximately in a warm place 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.800
 elapsed in now as you can see the 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.110
 mass has doubled or tripled its volume 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.640
 so we take some flour in the 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:43.070
 we spread over our bank of 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.070
 work and let's degas the mass 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.720
 once the mass is declassified with 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.670
 help of a sharp knife 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.410
 let's go cutting the so we're going to 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.090
 start cutting it into four parts 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.690
 same 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.690
 you 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.890
 once we have the dough cut in 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:11.930
 four equal pieces we are going to cut 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.930
 each piece in half 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.550
 now we have eight pieces so like 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.590
 what we want to achieve are sixteen 

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:23.520
 buns we will re-cut the 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.520
 mass in half 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.110
 so once we have them we all go 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.020
 to give them shape we take a piece of 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.300
 mass we goleamos and we will go giving it 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.710
 a smoothed shape as you see and I do 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.440
 from the center out 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.280
 hello we already have the shape of our 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.280
 first bagel 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:50.509
 and as we are going to have the 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.930
 let's go putting on a carpet 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:52.930
 cooking 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:08.210
 and once we have them we are all going to 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.210
 let stand half an hour 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.180
 let rest while the mass we 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.580
 to prepare the dough crosses and we're going to 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.190
 need 40 grams of tulip margarine 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.990
 120 grams of flour 100 milliliters of 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.630
 water and a teaspoon of 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.300
 to bake 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:32.540
 and here we have the margarine flour 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.700
 the baking powder and the water for 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:37.870
 prepare the pasta first thing we're going to 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.870
 to do is sift the flour 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:45.050
 and at the same time we will also add the 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.050
 teaspoon baking powder 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:53.520
 next we are going to add the 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.770
 tulip margarine and with the help of 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.110
 our hands we are going to mix it up 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:00.509
 that we are well integrated and lumps or 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.639
 once we have it we are going to add the 

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:09.660
 water and with the help of a spatula we are going to 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:12.300
 mix it well you should stay a mix 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:14.669
 spongy and without lumps 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.470
 after half an hour our buns 

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:18.840
 they will have doubled their volume so 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:20.400
 we put the pasta in a max deco and go 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.000
 to make some crosses on our 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.000
 rolls 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.360
 when we already have them all with help 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.900
 of a spatula let's eliminate the 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.900
 surplus 

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:55.389
 so once we have it clean 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:58.290
 we 're going to bake it for 10 minutes at 

00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:58.290
 190 degrees 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.650
 and once baked we're going to put them 

00:07:03.219 --> 00:07:07.569
 on a grate to cool and 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:09.189
 in this case I'm painting them with a 

00:07:07.569 --> 00:07:10.840
 light syrup but this step is 

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:14.490
 optional since you could also 

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:14.490
 sprinkle them with icing sugar 

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:21.950
