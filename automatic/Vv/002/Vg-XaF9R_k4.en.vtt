 a and g when great this edge has 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:47.539
 the original code is code 53 1889

 54,431 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:03.649
 means given 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:06.490
 rib comes in this form 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:10.009
 separately just a plastic edge and 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:13.270
 self-tapping screw for its fastening self-tapping screw 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:15.049
 we are twisted here in this hole 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:19.039
 directly the edge itself 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:21.830
 set on 6 snaps and how 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:23.810
 rule come out of order by the 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.820
 the reason that these latches break off 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.759
 break off they may for some 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.610
 most popular reasons for this 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:34.610
 either because you wash and some 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.440
 more or less hard heavy objects 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.300
 can be like shoes in most often 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.100
 example of sneakers that during 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:44.300
 washing beat therefore the edge 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.490
 and breaks these slits for the second by 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.500
 popularity is the reason why these latches 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.259
 break off is strangers 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.619
 items that fall into the typewriter and 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.899
 remain between the drum and the tank in 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.890
 time of rotation of the drum or spinning 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.560
 either in the wash 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.340
 This foreign object hits on 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.660
 latch and thus breaks them off 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.729
 therefore, I highly recommend you 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.310
 before installing the new edge find out 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.930
 the reason why the old ones were broken off 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.770
 edges well and eliminate accordingly 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.770
 this reason
