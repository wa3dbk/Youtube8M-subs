I<00:00:43.350> don't<00:00:43.590> think<00:00:43.649> miranda<00:00:44.430> is<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.640> kind<00:00:44.850> of

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
I don't think miranda is the kind of

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.910

know<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.890> I<00:00:49.980> think<00:00:50.250> Blake<00:00:50.520> Shelton<00:00:51.059> should

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
know it and I think Blake Shelton should

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.319 
know it and I think Blake Shelton should
be<00:00:51.420> very<00:00:51.690> afraid<00:00:52.079> because<00:00:52.860> now<00:00:53.430> we<00:00:53.879> have<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.239> on

making in that phone so many of the
stars<00:01:56.900> are<00:01:57.410> very<00:01:58.160> very<00:01:58.640> hesitant<00:01:59.060> to<00:02:00.010> even

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
stars are very very hesitant to even

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.780

accident 15 years ago and then it's kind

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.920 
accident 15 years ago and then it's kind
of<00:03:20.280> been<00:03:20.400> ironic<00:03:20.819> because<00:03:20.939> of<00:03:21.329> the<00:03:21.450> timing<00:03:21.840> is

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
of been ironic because of the timing is

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.539 
of been ironic because of the timing is
my<00:03:22.109> single<00:03:22.319> right<00:03:22.560> now<00:03:22.709> and<00:03:23.040> we<00:03:23.159> lost<00:03:23.370> his

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
my single right now and we lost his

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.490

father<00:03:23.760> in<00:03:23.939> January<00:03:24.450> and<00:03:24.810> also<00:03:25.230> one<00:03:25.379> of<00:03:25.409> my

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
father in January and also one of my

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.890 
father in January and also one of my
best<00:03:25.739> friends<00:03:26.040> from<00:03:26.129> childhood<00:03:26.340> and<00:03:26.760> a<00:03:27.629> dog

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
best friends from childhood and a dog

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.220 
best friends from childhood and a dog
and<00:03:28.230> so<00:03:28.680> it<00:03:29.010> was<00:03:29.129> just<00:03:29.250> kind<00:03:29.340> of<00:03:29.720> ironic<00:03:30.720> that

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
and so it was just kind of ironic that

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.929 
and so it was just kind of ironic that
this<00:03:31.500> song<00:03:31.709> was<00:03:31.739> happening<00:03:32.459> right<00:03:32.609> then<00:03:32.819> in

00:03:32.929 --> 00:03:32.939 
this song was happening right then in

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:35.659 
this song was happening right then in
our<00:03:33.060> lives<00:03:33.299> when<00:03:33.689> it's<00:03:34.530> exactly<00:03:35.129> the<00:03:35.280> emotion

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:35.669 
our lives when it's exactly the emotion

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:37.960 
our lives when it's exactly the emotion
we<00:03:35.790> were<00:03:35.909> feeling<00:03:36.090> so<00:03:36.599> it's<00:03:37.019> very<00:03:37.260> personal

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
we were feeling so it's very personal

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.129 
we were feeling so it's very personal
but<00:03:38.970> I<00:03:39.000> think<00:03:39.239> it's<00:03:39.359> not<00:03:39.689> so<00:03:39.810> personal<00:03:40.109> that

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139 
but I think it's not so personal that

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:41.629 
but I think it's not so personal that
people<00:03:40.439> can't<00:03:40.650> relate<00:03:40.799> because<00:03:41.220> everybody

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:41.639 
people can't relate because everybody

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:43.610 
people can't relate because everybody
comes<00:03:42.359> up<00:03:42.450> and<00:03:42.629> tells<00:03:42.750> me<00:03:42.900> their<00:03:43.079> story<00:03:43.379> that's

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
comes up and tells me their story that's

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.289 
comes up and tells me their story that's
a<00:03:43.709> classic<00:03:44.159> that's<00:03:44.639> something<00:03:45.030> that<00:03:45.150> people

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
a classic that's something that people

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.479 
a classic that's something that people
are<00:03:45.510> going<00:03:45.629> to<00:03:45.689> be<00:03:45.870> seeing<00:03:46.470> and<00:03:46.980> pointing<00:03:47.459> to

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
are going to be seeing and pointing to

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.759 
are going to be seeing and pointing to
is<00:03:47.730> a<00:03:47.760> great<00:03:48.299> country<00:03:48.659> song<00:03:48.840> 50<00:03:49.470> years<00:03:49.680> from

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
is a great country song 50 years from

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:58.570 
is a great country song 50 years from
now

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.760 

so<00:03:59.450> there<00:03:59.570> was<00:03:59.660> a<00:03:59.690> lot<00:03:59.870> of<00:04:00.020> high<00:04:00.110> expectations

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
so there was a lot of high expectations

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.170 
so there was a lot of high expectations
for<00:04:00.890> the<00:04:00.980> Pistol<00:04:01.280> Annies<00:04:01.310> second<00:04:01.880> album<00:04:02.120> a

for the Pistol Annies second album a

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.630 
for the Pistol Annies second album a
knee<00:04:02.240> up<00:04:02.450> they<00:04:03.110> really<00:04:03.740> didn't<00:04:04.130> let<00:04:04.250> anybody

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
knee up they really didn't let anybody

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.980 
knee up they really didn't let anybody
down<00:04:04.850> with<00:04:05.060> the<00:04:05.180> Allman<00:04:05.510> starting<00:04:05.810> with<00:04:05.900> the

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:05.990 
down with the Allman starting with the

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.930 
down with the Allman starting with the
first<00:04:06.230> single<00:04:06.410> hush<00:04:06.740> hush<00:04:07.010> it<00:04:07.550> was<00:04:07.700> just<00:04:07.850> a

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
first single hush hush it was just a

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.400 
first single hush hush it was just a
great<00:04:08.210> album<00:04:08.480> and<00:04:08.750> in<00:04:08.870> the<00:04:08.960> video<00:04:09.230> you<00:04:09.320> just

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
great album and in the video you just

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.200 
great album and in the video you just
see<00:04:09.650> them<00:04:09.800> having<00:04:10.010> a<00:04:10.070> blast<00:04:10.400> together<00:04:10.640> I<00:04:11.060> think

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:11.210 
see them having a blast together I think

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:12.760 
see them having a blast together I think
there<00:04:11.450> was<00:04:11.540> a<00:04:11.600> lot<00:04:11.810> of<00:04:11.960> expectation<00:04:12.620> on<00:04:12.740> the

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 
there was a lot of expectation on the

there was a lot of expectation on the
second<00:04:13.190> record<00:04:13.370> and<00:04:13.970> I<00:04:14.270> think<00:04:14.330> they<00:04:14.600> delivered

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
second record and I think they delivered

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.170 
second record and I think they delivered
I<00:04:15.560> think<00:04:15.800> there's<00:04:15.980> a<00:04:16.070> lot<00:04:16.220> of<00:04:16.340> great<00:04:16.519> songs<00:04:16.760> I

Miranda<00:07:11.370> Lambert<00:07:11.849> had<00:07:12.000> a<00:07:12.030> great<00:07:12.240> year<00:07:12.419> in<00:07:12.539> 2013

bigger<00:07:14.819> year<00:07:15.090> in<00:07:15.180> 2014

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:25.840
