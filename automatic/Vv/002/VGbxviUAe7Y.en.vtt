00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:10.920
 hello and welcome to sap in 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.009
 Let's take a look at this video 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.020
 the new ipad 2 is in tutow im 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.900
 geekbench 3 and then in the sunspider 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.070
 benchmark against the iphone 6 suggests 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.779
 Place the usual I had, of course 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.180
 both rebooted and we at 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.369
 both synonymous no running apps or 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.289
 we have a running app and 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.300
 Although the one tutu benchmark that you see 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.579
 now here because yes we want that directly 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.230
 let go through times and me yes 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.770
 not before the results 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.219
 betray 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.170
 we are at both version 5.0.1 the 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.739
 is the latest available for ios 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.510
 version 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.190
 both are also in the same wlan 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.960
 So network really identical 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.820
 conditions now look at me 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.620
 who in the end then the higher value 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.750
 spits out one or the other likes it 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.210
 Maybe I say I'm crazy 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.670
 because the one is a tablet that 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.960
 other a smartphone how can you do that 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.120
 compare with each other 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.920
 that has two reasons the first one is 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.229
 just once I currently unfortunately no 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.790
 another tablet since no ipad the first 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.040
 generation or any 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.380
 Android tablet and I thought so 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.840
 to me at my device so at 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.600
 iphone 6 the apple a8 one 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.680
 dual-core processor with 1 4 ghz four 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.710
 cores and a gigabyte 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.400
 memory and the ipad 2 den 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.680
 newer 8x processes this is a 3 core 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.420
 processor with 1 3 ghz can 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.369
 There are then 2 GB of RAM 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.840
 and I just thought that 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.340
 should be quite interesting 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.079
 the two processors like that 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.280
 Just compare with each other 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.409
 to look and what is to the 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.439
 difference between the apple a8 and 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.079
 the apple 8x wanted that as well 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.250
 I think some of you can see that 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.350
 this comparison actually quite 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.899
 fitting you can just look like 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.240
 many potent the processor in ipad 2 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.770
 then it really is and if you can do this too 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.520
 two gigabytes of RAM 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.409
 at least at the benchmarks 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.210
 benchmarks remain benchmarks but me 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.670
 think if you just the same 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.469
 platform also has so ios went aos 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.719
 that in any case, but reasonably 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.190
 representative what the pole hardware 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.830
 power then you can just 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.310
 look what the ipad 2 in principle 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.200
 be able to 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.840
 you know it in the tutu always needs something 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.140
 longer we are just 37 here 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.180
 That's why 34 percent say a few words 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.640
 my first impression of ipad 2 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.030
 I've been pretty much it for two now 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.800
 actually in use permanently 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.500
 What I noticed is that some have 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.300
 said this 30 grams difference to 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.190
 ipad resp 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.720
 this inner design that you notice yes 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.370
 I do not have to say that now after all 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.380
 I am the ipad of the first one year 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.569
 I've noticed it 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.790
 but quite clearly the ipad he 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.709
 two feels more times lighter in 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.880
 the hand might have been mine now 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.459
 also because of that I am at 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.920
 predecessor nor the lte model had that 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.420
 cellular model was something again 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.190
 weighs more so there then falls 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.049
 weight difference but more 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.330
 I think that's tight 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.280
 Ten or more different but what me 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.440
 With that we want to say personally it falls 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.830
 In any case, I think it's good that 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.360
 the ipad 2 is even lighter 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.519
 Of course you will say it someday 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.880
 then weigh the tablets only 20 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.410
 gram 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.940
 I think that will not be so fast 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.400
 we are still happening at the moment 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.260
 in areas where you have this where it is 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.420
 really the easier things are 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.430
 the better at least 10 inches 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.650
 areas make things easy 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.510
 makes much more portable what me too 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.760
 still noticed is the display is 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.500
 actually not much better though 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.359
 you realize that it is a little better 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.420
 in that it is now directly 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:39.160
 laminated with the glass but what me there 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.319
 at the same time noticed who 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.630
 me here such an anti reflex 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.639
 coating and i have in unboxing 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.590
 already mentioned you can see that too 

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:51.819
 may come is very good at video 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:53.620
 about in comparison to the iphone 6 yes but 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.450
 So what has been noticed? 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.579
 somehow the ipad 2 can be 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.829
 more difficult to clean than the still 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:01.569
 ipad the first generation of the case was 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:03.220
 So it is somehow clear 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:04.810
 more sensitive to fingerprints 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.970
 at least that's how I feel 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.690
 I still have to go after the first two days 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.940
 continue testing 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:13.030
 maybe this has something with this 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.430
 reflection layer to do that one just 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.139
 but also quite clear especially 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.239
 if it just does not stand then it has 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.440
 to a blue shimmer if it 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.070
 usually always quite 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.480
 So at least that's black 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.670
 at iphone 6 and so it was at 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.980
 ipad of the first generation 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:30.080
 Now we are 100 percent first 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.330
 impression of ipad 2 is on everyone 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.270
 case is pretty pretty good test 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.720
 completely so that's already one 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.970
 display 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:42.620
 who here 62 1996 points a very high 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.300
 worth i have not had any device in yet 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.430
 tutow benchmark is worth a higher value 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.530
 Of course, I did not have that either 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.360
 one to one with android devices 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.700
 Compare it would have already seen 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.290
 who runs the tutow benchmark at 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.110
 iphone 6 for example still not 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.520
 in the native resolution but me 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.270
 think you can do it quite well 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:04.550
 we now compare 48,600 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.470
 70 points so clearly again 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.090
 more at ipad 2 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.510
 that definitely speaks for 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:13.190
 the apple 8x and further it gets now in 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.660
 geekbench drivers corresponded to her 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.340
 here again the technical data and 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.480
 You also see that I fool before 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.550
 tells us we have of course 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.790
 actually a 3 core processor here 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:26.090
 on the apple ipad r 2, however, clocks 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:28.490
 with 1 5 ghz can and not with 1.3 ghz 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.870
 as I just said wrong but 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.190
 we also have two gigabytes 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.290
 memory as you can see here 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.700
 we can also let the opponents 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.380
 run through the driver 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.880
 he always goes away very quickly 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.920
 also a very good proof 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.360
 Comparison is possible with both 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.700
 super as one of apple actually 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.980
 Now we are just waiting for that 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.720
 whole here is very fast away 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.100
 I always find it interesting 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.530
 because we just have this single-core score 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.270
 have around this multi-core score there can 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.190
 you look good then what 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.810
 this one of these more cores so if we 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.760
 but again a little more here 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.640
 new ipad whether one difference 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:04.520
 yes and I think you can see that 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.540
 here quite impressive when we look 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:10.280
 Here we have the look in the 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:12.260
 single cosco 1814 to 1631 so there are 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:18.530
 There are hardly any differences in the multi 

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:20.300
 cores choir but then 4494 to 2927 so 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.700
 but quite a bit clearer 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.530
 difference shows how well 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:26.420
 potent this processor really here 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:28.880
 It is definitely a great one 

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:30.470
 worth and last but not least now 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.520
 nor the sunspider benchmark 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:34.379
 mainly a javascript 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.180
 benchmark the clouds is very very many 

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:38.490
 See you at the last benchmark 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.750
 video to the iphone 6 so far we do 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.970
 which now directly times there goes namely 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:44.639
 also very very fast once here 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:46.020
 there again is exactly what should 

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:47.250
 really in a few seconds now 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.710
 be done and then we'll see 

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:51.319
 who here is the lower economy so 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:54.030
 this is actually about it 

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:56.669
 which one of them just at the end one 

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:58.830
 lower score has the same browser 

00:06:56.669 --> 00:06:59.879
 in this respect also relative here again 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:03.870
 identical conditions 

00:06:59.879 --> 00:07:06.479
 the ipad 2 is finished has 296 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:10.110
 milliseconds done and the iphone 6 

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:11.849
 has done 346 2 milliseconds here 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:14.340
 So they are both relative again 

00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:17.430
 close to each other but also wins here 

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:18.690
 the ipad2 very light people that's it 

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:20.310
 again from these short ones 

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:22.560
 benchmark video that you can end up with 

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:24.840
 say I think you're pretty good 

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.370
 seen that the ipad 2 too 

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.289
 benchmark not technically 

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:30.090
 Above all, the competition must hide 

00:07:28.289 --> 00:07:32.129
 values ​​in geekbench benchmarks are already 

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:33.270
 pretty impressive even if you do that 

00:07:32.129 --> 00:07:34.740
 For example we have with the 

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.539
 android competition compares I am 

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:38.610
 Now then quite excited that to 

00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:41.669
 for example the nexus 9 with the nvidia 

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:43.199
 tegra k1 that's the name he says so creates 

00:07:41.669 --> 00:07:45.210
 that should also be pretty interesting 

00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:45.960
 that should be soon on the 

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:48.270
 market come 

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.560
 yes in that sense what I hope that 

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:51.900
 I liked you video, thank you 

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:54.680
 to watch and say 'see you' 

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:54.680
 next time
