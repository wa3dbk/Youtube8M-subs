no<00:00:57.870> doubt<00:00:58.280> again<00:00:59.280> it's<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.699> chance<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.539> have<00:01:00.629> a

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
no doubt again it's a chance to have a

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.569 
no doubt again it's a chance to have a
nice<00:01:00.809> look<00:01:01.079> at<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.350> car<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.800> 60<00:01:02.219> frames<00:01:02.460> per

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
nice look at that car that 60 frames per

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.910 
nice look at that car that 60 frames per
second<00:01:03.059> 1080p<00:01:03.660> car<00:01:03.960> as<00:01:04.199> we<00:01:04.350> now<00:01:04.500> see<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.800> from

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
second 1080p car as we now see it from

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.060 
second 1080p car as we now see it from
an<00:01:05.040> external<00:01:05.400> point<00:01:05.730> of<00:01:05.940> view<00:01:06.860> the<00:01:07.860> game

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
an external point of view the game

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.469 
an external point of view the game
running<00:01:08.369> at<00:01:08.549> this<00:01:08.640> frame<00:01:08.909> rate<00:01:09.090> does<00:01:09.270> seem

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
running at this frame rate does seem

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.510 
running at this frame rate does seem
much<00:01:09.720> slower<00:01:10.170> from<00:01:10.740> this<00:01:10.890> point<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.220> view<00:01:11.250> than

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
much slower from this point of view than

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.830 
much slower from this point of view than
it<00:01:11.610> does<00:01:11.759> from<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:12.030> car<00:01:12.270> but<00:01:12.479> then<00:01:12.600> games

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
it does from in car but then games

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.210 
it does from in car but then games
always<00:01:13.049> do<00:01:13.320> seem<00:01:13.530> much<00:01:13.710> slower<00:01:13.920> from<00:01:14.159> an

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
always do seem much slower from an

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.800 
always do seem much slower from an
external<00:01:14.490> view<00:01:14.820> point<00:01:15.060> but<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.299> does<00:01:15.450> give<00:01:15.659> you

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
external view point but it does give you

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.030 
external view point but it does give you
more<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.200> view<00:01:16.409> of<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.560> surrounding

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
more of a view of the surrounding

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.960 
more of a view of the surrounding
environment<00:01:19.340> I'm<00:01:20.340> going<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.610> go<00:01:20.700> through<00:01:20.880> all

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
environment I'm going to go through all

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.700 
environment I'm going to go through all
this<00:01:21.150> at<00:01:21.329> some<00:01:21.509> point<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.960> analyze<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.560> all<00:01:22.680> a

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
this at some point and analyze it all a

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.399 
this at some point and analyze it all a
bit<00:01:22.979> further<00:01:26.270> so<00:01:27.270> we<00:01:27.299> see<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.540> kind<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.960> hue

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
bit further so we see that kind of hue

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.580 
bit further so we see that kind of hue
from<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.829> lighting<00:01:32.930> that<00:01:33.930> we<00:01:34.110> just<00:01:34.290> need<00:01:34.470> to

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
from the lighting that we just need to

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.109 
from the lighting that we just need to
see<00:01:34.770> how<00:01:34.920> many<00:01:35.100> players<00:01:35.310> there<00:01:35.640> are<00:01:35.820> how<00:01:36.090> many

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
see how many players there are how many

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.670 
see how many players there are how many
players<00:01:36.509> online<00:01:38.329> and<00:01:39.380> again<00:01:40.380> whether<00:01:40.530> the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
players online and again whether the

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.520 
players online and again whether the
track<00:01:40.890> surface<00:01:41.100> has<00:01:41.460> any<00:01:41.610> dynamic<00:01:42.409> aspects<00:01:43.409> to

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
track surface has any dynamic aspects to

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.670 
track surface has any dynamic aspects to
it<00:01:43.560> as<00:01:43.740> well<00:01:44.630> probably<00:01:45.630> not<00:01:45.810> given<00:01:46.320> fact<00:01:46.530> it's

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
it as well probably not given fact it's

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.410 
it as well probably not given fact it's
a<00:01:46.770> launch<00:01:46.950> title<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:49.340> am<00:01:50.340> going<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.850> post<00:01:51.149> some

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
a launch title I am going to post some

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.179 
a launch title I am going to post some
of<00:01:51.509> these<00:01:51.600> questions<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.469> term<00:01:52.649> 10<00:01:52.950> guys

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
of these questions to the term 10 guys

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.510 
of these questions to the term 10 guys
when<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.060> comes<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.570> track<00:01:55.140> evolution<00:01:55.799> because

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
when it comes to track evolution because

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.160 
when it comes to track evolution because
it's<00:01:56.820> it's<00:01:57.060> it's<00:01:57.360> all<00:01:57.479> well<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.659> good<00:01:57.810> having

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
it's it's it's all well and good having

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.899 
it's it's it's all well and good having
all<00:01:58.290> this<00:01:58.409> evolution<00:01:59.009> in<00:01:59.130> terms<00:01:59.159> of<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.670> tires

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
all this evolution in terms of the tires

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.330 
all this evolution in terms of the tires
but<00:02:00.450> it's<00:02:01.020> nice<00:02:01.289> to<00:02:01.590> see<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.770> develop

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
but it's nice to see that develop

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.709 
but it's nice to see that develop

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
because he was a very individual man and

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.990 
because he was a very individual man and
it's<00:02:46.230> nice<00:02:46.350> to<00:02:46.560> see<00:02:46.709> now<00:02:46.920> that<00:02:47.130> suddenly<00:02:47.430> he's

it's nice to see now that suddenly he's
been<00:02:48.240> mentioned<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:48.990> it<00:02:49.110> will<00:02:49.200> create<00:02:49.320> a

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
been mentioned and it will create a

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.020 
been mentioned and it will create a
whole<00:02:49.620> new<00:02:49.650> bunch<00:02:49.980> of<00:02:50.250> fans<00:02:50.459> that<00:02:50.670> never<00:02:50.880> knew

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
whole new bunch of fans that never knew

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.410 
whole new bunch of fans that never knew
he<00:02:51.150> existed<00:02:51.630> for<00:02:52.170> a<00:02:52.200> long<00:02:52.260> time<00:02:53.000> so<00:02:54.000> that's

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
he existed for a long time so that's

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.090 
he existed for a long time so that's
that's<00:02:54.780> what<00:02:54.959> I<00:02:54.989> hope<00:02:55.200> from<00:02:55.440> it<00:02:55.560> anyway<00:02:55.860> that

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
that's what I hope from it anyway that

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.830 
that's what I hope from it anyway that
he'd<00:02:56.280> certainly<00:02:56.550> deserved<00:02:57.480> a<00:02:57.570> bit<00:02:57.690> more

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
he'd certainly deserved a bit more

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.040 
he'd certainly deserved a bit more
recognition<00:02:58.320> for<00:02:58.830> who<00:02:59.370> he<00:02:59.489> was<00:02:59.670> as<00:02:59.910> a<00:02:59.940> man<00:03:00.180> but

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
recognition for who he was as a man but

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.690 
recognition for who he was as a man but
I'm<00:03:01.200> rambling<00:03:02.040> on<00:03:02.160> while<00:03:02.370> watching<00:03:02.610> this
