00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.130
 good morning class getting help starting 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.849
 And there he watched yesterday, he gave a lot of laughter. 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.759
 it's right 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.280
 bunch of freaks in my opinion, right? 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.059
 can see a skirt tail that goes crazy 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.270
 huh 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:22.410
 I keep thinking this youth pulls 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.090
 Life is the youth of fla pi right that's right 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.170
 let's go and start losing the workshop 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.330
 today showing images in truth 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.170
 showing pictures that was good, right? 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.170
 showing images 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.840
 I'll show you here now I 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.489
 I will not even edit it, it's going to stay anyway 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.070
 I want to show you there is no doubt 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.260
 from a customer the owner of a car saw the 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.430
 his engine in another car 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.789
 only the other car is not the same 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:56.370
 brand because it happens very common is 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:59.879
 win come here for a Corsican 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.390
 equipped with vhc engine is 1.0 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:06.810
 in fact the chevrolet's 1.0 engine does not 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:10.979
 equipped in no time the fit line 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:14.070
 but engines derived from this same block 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.820
 in case the 1.8 engine has been equipped 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.220
 fiat fiat motors 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.630
 Look, one look at the engine looks the 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.659
 engine shape 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.619
 the cover looks only at the coil type candles 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:35.040
 event are gm 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:40.470
 now lets go on the fit look the same 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:47.750
 engine but 1.8 is on 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:53.750
 they understood very cool ne or citroen 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:56.450
 it is almost ready to arrive and 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.700
 the pieces were already to reach these 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.100
 but it has not arrived yet is a problem 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.050
 very common garage 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:07.250
 you lose a part at the dealership 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:09.380
 talking you have and do not send is a fight 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.380
 the car she'll be ready more 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.180
 earlier today I have not got a story 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.240
 of parts 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.260
 nothing nothing nothing complicated deliver on 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.910
 first time 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.620
 in this first one it's difficult, right let's go 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.290
 staff is that the sea is not exploding 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.950
 collector finally the whole diagnosis 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.080
 made all localized defects 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.790
 in fact he was working with the 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.340
 lower pressure but the defect was not 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.020
 pump was a pressure regulator already 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.280
 replace the lid regulator 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.989
 and is already working on 3,816 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.840
 of air mass pain, right? 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.250
 the bi subway was also reporting 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.040
 wrong mass for the unit of 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.870
 engine control and the lambda 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.380
 original yet original factory 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:00.110
 also caught in poor mix 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.310
 this all contributes to a bad 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.739
 the engine and 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.739
 consequently study of the collector 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:09.410
 So let's run the car with 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.690
 of the new mass meter from 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.790
 ideal fuel pressure and I doubt 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:20.480
 much that this collector sells made 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:22.180
 again and the caption 100% arrived aa good 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.650
 water and parts at the utility 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.470
 they are repairing that the water pump 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.510
 came from the metal dealer 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.730
 It has a metal casing let 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.019
 approach here folks see the staff in 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.170
 video center 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:40.040
 you will now see the water pump with the 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:42.950
 metal casing is the same is provided 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:46.489
 by the citroen itself at the pump 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:51.260
 with plastic housing not only looks this 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:52.760
 is the entire pump in plastic and 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.829
 it was replaced 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.770
 it was not for nothing that they did this 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:04:00.410
 the filter is not 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.520
 that a light metal will enter and the 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.280
 still bearing 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.710
 oriented are all unique as well as 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.230
 the belt that car to make the exchange 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.570
 of the tool belt needs to be 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.450
 that these pins that go here in the 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:19.130
 control valves and a 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:20.480
 another that will score below the pm 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.750
 let's take a look here how 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:27.170
 things ena 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:29.930
 so the line received brake pads 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:33.080
 new acquaintance with this type of engagement 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:37.190
 that the back is a type of spray 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:40.690
 people apply and onaell giving a touch 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:43.400
 here in the valve cover of the focus 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:46.730
 received help from the new valve cap 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.470
 and also spotting leakage in the 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:51.650
 tree up doing a vineyard review 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.090
 Nice even makes the act had not 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.650
 No one here in the elevator wants to speak. 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.030
 for you here a detail about the part 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.120
 of rear brakes 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:03.080
 you often do that review 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:06.920
 here is a shoe 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:09.790
 new neon shows there also the 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:13.370
 part of this beautiful everything ok but look at it 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:16.520
 here are the brake drums and the 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:19.160
 brake drums also wear out 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:22.100
 recreate accident here wear here 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.920
 today a minimum of wear and tear with the 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:28.280
 man creates a kind of frizzo inside 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:31.970
 What a nuisance it gets in the way of 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:33.050
 braking and also generating noise is still 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.760
 very good 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.140
 it is important to check at the time of 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.440
 replacement of brake components 

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:43.010
 if the drum needs to be 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.720
 replaced or not 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:49.460
 It is with basalt meditation seeing the 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:51.400
 Pressure in the system here puffer 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:55.790
 coating 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:06:01.910
 You're right, and you 're right. 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:03.710
 and then genuine cooking assembled in our 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:08.270
 Account Executive 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:10.910
 turns under the cool thing is that the two 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:13.520
 turns lowering the tone after the 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:14.990
 two laps it gets very tense in the 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.990
 Let me have a look, can you? 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.400
 the brand looks there to approach it 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.440
 asked her not to jump that now 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:24.350
 better just felt it there, guys 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:30.020
 perfect distribution ne 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:33.560
 That's right, it's good to get your brother. 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.910
 His name is Venezuelan now. 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.570
 16 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:41.900
 my proposal is absolutely right here in 

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:45.800
 down but the staff then 80 is 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:48.890
 leaking is the one here is not leaking there 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:52.010
 making this whole nonsense buzz and 

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:54.440
 tried new fitted and gasket cover 

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:58.790
 valves also mounted shift the following 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:07:00.410
 in the end being here not to 

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:04.010
 to finish much of the service 

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:05.570
 because some parts were delivered only 

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:08.690
 in the afternoon parts were bought 

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:11.000
 were bought yesterday promised to 

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:13.460
 today arrived early this afternoon is the lack 

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.790
 commitment there at the time of purchase until 

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:19.400
 even from a simple automotive part and is 

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:23.000
 This morning, who knows, there are more 

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:25.160
 friday is a quiet day 

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.990
 usually more delivery but their 

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.390
 carts even more power to review the 

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:31.520
 People show you beauty, hug to 

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:34.550
 you if you like the video do not leave 

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:35.420
 to give your basic little toy for a change 

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:40.450
 beauty 

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:40.450
 a hug for you and see you tomorrow
