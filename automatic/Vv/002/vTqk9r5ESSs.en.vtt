adjustment on my servo to like sixty
five<00:02:23.260> percent<00:02:23.740> because<00:02:24.100> any<00:02:24.400> more<00:02:24.640> than<00:02:24.820> that

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
five percent because any more than that

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.270 
five percent because any more than that
it<00:02:25.060> overthrows<00:02:25.600> the<00:02:25.660> servo<00:02:26.260> but<00:02:27.040> it<00:02:27.130> works

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
it overthrows the servo but it works

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.250 
it overthrows the servo but it works
good<00:02:27.520> a<00:02:27.760> coarseness<00:02:28.270> is<00:02:28.390> all<00:02:28.540> we'll<00:02:28.930> all<00:02:29.020> be<00:02:29.230> in

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
good a coarseness is all we'll all be in

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.440 
good a coarseness is all we'll all be in
the<00:02:29.440> body<00:02:29.650> also<00:02:30.430> have<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:30.790> trim<00:02:31.030> this<00:02:31.210> down<00:02:31.270> a

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
the body also have to trim this down a

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.300 
the body also have to trim this down a
little<00:02:31.600> bit<00:02:31.870> underneath<00:02:32.230> this<00:02:32.500> to<00:02:33.010> get<00:02:33.100> it<00:02:33.220> to

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
little bit underneath this to get it to

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.190 
little bit underneath this to get it to
fit<00:02:33.490> and<00:02:33.760> now<00:02:34.540> i'm<00:02:34.600> going<00:02:34.720> to<00:02:34.780> set<00:02:35.020> it<00:02:35.050> on<00:02:35.140> the

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
fit and now i'm going to set it on the

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.710 
fit and now i'm going to set it on the
ground<00:02:35.320> it<00:02:35.980> flies<00:02:36.370> with<00:02:36.640> this<00:02:36.760> 27<00:02:37.210> turn<00:02:37.480> murder

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
ground it flies with this 27 turn murder

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.949 
ground it flies with this 27 turn murder
so<00:02:38.320> later<00:02:38.530> on<00:02:38.620> a<00:02:38.950> math<00:02:39.250> to<00:02:39.400> get<00:02:39.550> like<00:02:39.670> a<00:02:39.700> 55<00:02:40.300> or

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
so later on a math to get like a 55 or

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.740 
so later on a math to get like a 55 or
maybe<00:02:41.320> even<00:02:41.440> a<00:02:41.620> 65<00:02:42.160> turn<00:02:42.370> motor<00:02:42.610> here<00:02:43.510> let<00:02:43.720> me

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
maybe even a 65 turn motor here let me

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:52.140 
maybe even a 65 turn motor here let me
set<00:02:43.959> it<00:02:43.990> on<00:02:44.140> the<00:02:44.170> ground<00:02:47.640> be<00:02:48.640> patient<00:02:51.150> the

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
set it on the ground be patient the

00:02:52.150 --> 00:03:02.730 
set it on the ground be patient the
circle<00:02:52.930> circle<00:02:53.920> works<00:02:54.160> really<00:02:54.370> good<00:02:54.640> strong

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:19.340 

we<00:03:03.370> have<00:03:03.520> a<00:03:03.550> novice<00:03:04.030> film<00:03:04.330> with<00:03:04.540> boomer

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
it's pretty quick one sec let me go down

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:30.650 
it's pretty quick one sec let me go down
here<00:03:23.830> turn<00:03:24.220> back<00:03:24.370> around<00:03:28.440> we<00:03:29.440> have<00:03:29.560> a<00:03:29.590> novice

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
here turn back around we have a novice

cleaner it's a pretty nice i really like
it<00:04:13.480> that<00:04:14.100> our<00:04:15.100> servo<00:04:15.580> again<00:04:15.970> is<00:04:16.239> really<00:04:16.570> nice

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:24.659 

look<00:04:23.020> it's<00:04:23.379> pretty<00:04:23.650> strong<00:04:23.889> with<00:04:24.400> the<00:04:24.520> high

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
look it's pretty strong with the high

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.830 
look it's pretty strong with the high
lift<00:04:24.969> the<00:04:25.319> 2075<00:04:26.319> could<00:04:26.680> not<00:04:26.830> turn<00:04:27.069> the<00:04:28.030> wheels

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
lift the 2075 could not turn the wheels

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.610 
lift the 2075 could not turn the wheels
while<00:04:29.770> on<00:04:29.979> the<00:04:30.099> ground<00:04:30.370> but<00:04:31.330> this<00:04:31.990> returns<00:04:32.439> it

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
while on the ground but this returns it

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.330 
while on the ground but this returns it
easily<00:04:33.779> when<00:04:34.779> it's<00:04:34.900> on<00:04:35.020> the<00:04:35.110> ground<00:04:35.139> so<00:04:36.129> yeah

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
easily when it's on the ground so yeah

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.339 
easily when it's on the ground so yeah
how<00:04:36.969> much<00:04:37.029> think<00:04:37.360> in<00:04:37.479> the<00:04:37.569> comment<00:04:38.020> just<00:04:38.169> is

00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:38.349 
how much think in the comment just is

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:41.610 
how much think in the comment just is
part<00:04:38.620> two<00:04:38.830> of<00:04:38.860> my<00:04:39.039> build<00:04:39.460> hopefully<00:04:40.620> tomorrow

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
part two of my build hopefully tomorrow

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.360 
part two of my build hopefully tomorrow
I<00:04:41.979> will<00:04:42.159> have<00:04:42.460> on<00:04:42.729> the<00:04:43.539> other<00:04:43.719> part<00:04:44.080> part<00:04:44.949> 3

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
I will have on the other part part 3

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.309 
I will have on the other part part 3
hopefully<00:04:46.240> it'll<00:04:46.360> be<00:04:46.419> all<00:04:46.569> ready<00:04:46.779> to<00:04:46.870> go<00:04:46.990> and

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:47.319 
hopefully it'll be all ready to go and

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:48.450 
hopefully it'll be all ready to go and
then<00:04:47.439> after<00:04:47.680> that<00:04:47.710> we'll<00:04:47.949> test<00:04:48.189> it<00:04:48.310> in<00:04:48.430> the

then after that we'll test it in the

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.969 
then after that we'll test it in the
backyard<00:04:48.699> and<00:04:49.180> then<00:04:49.810> maybe<00:04:50.050> like<00:04:50.229> wednesday
