been here for a good while now now
touching<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:35.160> main<00:00:35.460> bar<00:00:35.670> just<00:00:35.850> under<00:00:36.149> here

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
touching the main bar just under here

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.930 
touching the main bar just under here
there<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.050> some<00:00:37.260> heat<00:00:37.860> there<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.129> small<00:00:38.610> amount

there is some heat there a small amount
that<00:00:39.000> we<00:00:39.180> can<00:00:39.329> fail<00:00:39.629> so<00:00:40.530> there<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:40.770> something

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
that we can fail so there is something

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.549 
that we can fail so there is something
going<00:00:41.129> on<00:00:41.460> but<00:00:41.670> still<00:00:41.850> not<00:00:42.329> switching<00:00:42.600> on<00:00:42.870> so

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.459 
what I'm going to do is take a look at
the<00:00:46.230> main<00:00:46.800> rod<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.730> see<00:00:47.969> where<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:49.110> problems

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
the main rod to see where the problems

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.470 
the main rod to see where the problems
might<00:00:49.649> be<00:00:49.680> on<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.460> morrow<00:00:50.700> what<00:00:50.969> we<00:00:51.059> have<00:00:51.239> here

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
might be on the morrow what we have here

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.680 
might be on the morrow what we have here
we<00:00:52.140> are<00:00:52.170> inside<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:53.460> iPhone<00:00:54.149> now<00:00:54.390> should<00:00:54.660> I

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
we are inside the iPhone now should I

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.110 
we are inside the iPhone now should I
say<00:00:54.899> but<00:00:55.469> yeah<00:00:55.620> what<00:00:55.770> we've<00:00:55.920> got<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.280> the

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
say but yeah what we've got is the

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.110 
say but yeah what we've got is the
battery<00:00:57.750> connector<00:00:58.170> here<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.649> there<00:00:58.800> are<00:00:59.120> as

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
battery connector here and there are as

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.470 
battery connector here and there are as
I<00:01:00.300> can<00:01:00.480> show<00:01:00.719> them<00:01:01.850> clearly<00:01:02.850> enough<00:01:03.180> there<00:01:03.449> are

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
I can show them clearly enough there are

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.910 
I can show them clearly enough there are
components<00:01:04.610> behind<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:06.270> connector<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.439> one

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
components behind the connector and one

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.560 
components behind the connector and one
of<00:01:08.070> them<00:01:08.250> through<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.610> water<00:01:08.760> damage<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.479> think

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
of them through the water damage I think

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.020 
of them through the water damage I think
has<00:01:10.229> burnt<00:01:10.500> out<00:01:10.770> just<00:01:11.070> on<00:01:11.159> visibly<00:01:11.549> looking<00:01:11.729> at

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
has burnt out just on visibly looking at

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.000 
has burnt out just on visibly looking at
it<00:01:12.180> on<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.299> magnifying<00:01:12.840> glass<00:01:12.960> now<00:01:13.860> you've

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
it on the magnifying glass now you've

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.370 
it on the magnifying glass now you've
got<00:01:14.100> this<00:01:14.189> red<00:01:14.430> mark<00:01:14.729> here<00:01:14.880> there's<00:01:15.750> also<00:01:15.900> one

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
got this red mark here there's also one

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.890 
got this red mark here there's also one
up<00:01:16.950> at<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.250> top<00:01:17.460> there<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.790> water<00:01:18.090> indicators

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
up at the top there the water indicators

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.679 
up at the top there the water indicators
that<00:01:19.110> means<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.799> there<00:01:20.250> has<00:01:20.369> been<00:01:20.689> water

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
that means that there has been water

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.920 
that means that there has been water
inside<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.470> phone<00:01:23.090> but<00:01:24.090> yes<00:01:24.240> this<00:01:24.420> one<00:01:24.659> here

inside the phone but yes this one here

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.780 
inside the phone but yes this one here
and<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.500> problem<00:01:25.860> I've<00:01:26.159> seen<00:01:26.369> on<00:01:26.490> one<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.670> the

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
and the problem I've seen on one of the

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.749 
and the problem I've seen on one of the
components<00:01:27.479> but<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.500> test<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.920> continuity<00:01:29.430> to

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
components but a test of continuity to

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.010 
components but a test of continuity to
see<00:01:29.909> if<00:01:30.030> there's<00:01:30.210> anything<00:01:30.420> happening<00:01:30.780> with

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
see if there's anything happening with

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.370 
see if there's anything happening with
it<00:01:31.290> see<00:01:31.590> if<00:01:31.650> it's<00:01:31.829> faulty<00:01:32.460> or<00:01:32.729> not<00:01:32.970> if<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:34.020> is

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
it see if it's faulty or not if it is

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.969 
it see if it's faulty or not if it is
faulty<00:01:35.369> I'm<00:01:35.610> going<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.939> remove<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.560> and<00:01:37.560> fit<00:01:37.950> a

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
faulty I'm going to remove it and fit a

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.149 
faulty I'm going to remove it and fit a
new<00:01:38.280> one<00:01:38.780> and<00:01:39.780> then<00:01:40.350> we'll<00:01:40.590> move<00:01:40.710> on<00:01:40.860> alright

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
new one and then we'll move on alright

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.749 
new one and then we'll move on alright
as<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.750> suspected<00:01:42.750> there<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.799> component<00:01:44.399> this

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
as I suspected there is a component this

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.920 
as I suspected there is a component this
faulty<00:01:47.030> not<00:01:48.030> gonna<00:01:48.180> be<00:01:48.270> able<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.450> show<00:01:48.659> them

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
faulty not gonna be able to show them

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.530 
faulty not gonna be able to show them
very<00:01:49.860> clearly<00:01:50.159> unfortunately<00:01:51.060> because<00:01:51.360> they

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
very clearly unfortunately because they

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.200 
very clearly unfortunately because they
are<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:52.079> small<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.860> lot<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:53.579> components<00:01:53.880> out

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
are so small a lot of components out

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.080 
are so small a lot of components out

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.550 
bank three component one two three the
two<00:02:03.060> components<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:03.810> hope<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.049> can<00:02:04.200> see<00:02:04.409> it

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
two components I hope you can see it

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.039 
two components I hope you can see it
there<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.460> at<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.700> bottom<00:02:05.880> are<00:02:06.240> there<00:02:06.450> the

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
there and at the bottom are there the

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.859 
there and at the bottom are there the
one<00:02:07.200> in<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.380> middle<00:02:07.500> that<00:02:07.619> burns<00:02:07.950> away

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
one in the middle that burns away

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.419 
one in the middle that burns away
that's<00:02:09.289> where<00:02:09.440> you<00:02:09.530> can<00:02:09.679> sort<00:02:09.890> of<00:02:09.979> see<00:02:10.160> it<00:02:10.190> very

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
that's where you can sort of see it very

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.070 
that's where you can sort of see it very
well<00:02:10.880> what<00:02:11.180> I'm<00:02:11.270> going<00:02:11.390> to<00:02:11.450> do<00:02:11.540> is<00:02:11.660> dissolve

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
well what I'm going to do is dissolve

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.790 
well what I'm going to do is dissolve
that<00:02:12.319> the<00:02:12.470> remaining<00:02:12.890> pensively<00:02:14.380> solder<00:02:15.380> in<00:02:15.560> a

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
that the remaining pensively solder in a

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.280 
that the remaining pensively solder in a
new<00:02:16.370> component<00:02:16.880> to<00:02:17.270> get<00:02:17.420> continuity<00:02:18.050> going

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
new component to get continuity going

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.070 
new component to get continuity going
again<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:20.180> then<00:02:20.300> we'll<00:02:20.420> test<00:02:20.599> the<00:02:20.780> secret

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
again and then we'll test the secret

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.449 
again and then we'll test the secret
like<00:02:21.200> this<00:02:21.230> is<00:02:21.470> done<00:02:21.650> now<00:02:21.890> we've<00:02:22.099> got<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.340> new

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
like this is done now we've got the new

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.820 
like this is done now we've got the new
component<00:02:22.970> soldered<00:02:23.390> in<00:02:23.540> haven't<00:02:24.349> really

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
component soldered in haven't really

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.470 
component soldered in haven't really
been<00:02:24.950> able<00:02:25.040> to<00:02:25.160> show<00:02:25.430> much<00:02:25.700> because<00:02:26.060> of<00:02:26.239> how

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
been able to show much because of how

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.190 
been able to show much because of how
small<00:02:27.790> components<00:02:28.790> are<00:02:29.000> we've<00:02:29.599> got<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:29.989> the

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
small components are we've got the the

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.110 
small components are we've got the the
bank<00:02:30.410> of<00:02:30.620> three<00:02:31.010> now<00:02:31.310> no<00:02:31.580> have<00:02:31.849> you<00:02:31.940> can<00:02:32.090> see

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
bank of three now no have you can see
