00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:22.510
 underwear wards are crossed for two of all 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.190
 hi for mp3 arjuna patronus to video 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.380
 on the war country please if anyone 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.840
 later on the guys i dodged 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.690
 and this is the second release of the second season 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.460
 android with you as always i am black 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.070
 knight inquisition videoblogging on 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:41.410
 the service of the most obscene aaron channel 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:43.600
 This is my channel so they drove the first 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.210
 the game is my favorite tanker ler 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.060
 has a pile of coal cubes of iron 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.100
 gold but not minecraft ahead 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.920
 mayn't personally I fall in love with that game for 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.420
 interesting enough gameplay tom 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.030
 sense that there is a lot 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.190
 various buns like cards which 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.020
 you can either buy for 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.300
 real money either 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.130
 rubies you can buy either 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.530
 invite friends you can 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.870
 find here such a vicious circle package 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.850
 May we get the batch today 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.470
 games are such that you have to dig down like 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.240
 as far as possible and as much as possible 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.950
 more interesting rut you dig those 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.020
 more will give you a reward and the faster 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.049
 you can turn off your pickaxe either 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.830
 buy a new card is not only 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.990
 off pick pick 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.390
 cards are not sold in principle the game 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.430
 just yes not exhaustion of course here 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.110
 There are additional tasks of the type to collect 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.630
 all things from one thing low 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.030
 collections but this is bigger and not true 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.340
 strongly distracts from the game like the process itself 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.450
 bathing minecraft lovers should 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.450
 like drove on 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.560
 she teaches us waiting for the following not 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.080
 less interesting and more colorful game 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.570
 damn no sense judging by the name you're not 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.070
 they must wipe their adversary away 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.780
 here you need to arrange it in colors 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.600
 luminous followers of color flowers 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.790
 it sounds very confusing and so it is 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.980
 it is very confusing and sometimes logic 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.540
 applications can simply not understand though 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.070
 in fact initially played very 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.110
 just and it makes you want to play more 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.090
 it seems to me this game is great 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.250
 suitable for those who are going to become 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.070
 artistâ€™s designer because 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.770
 cute looks all around and level cute 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:24.140
 and sat in cute i generally love this game 5 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:27.540
 5 and then the next game is called 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.340
 complete destruction kidding wipe out 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.260
 if you translate the name into Russian she 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.570
 sounds much more epic than it really is 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.940
 it's just that the game is 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.280
 reminds me of big races or whatever 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.530
 it was called so here in the game we have to 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.270
 just jump running back obstacles while 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.340
 this pump your character or 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.500
 buying a new character passing new 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.390
 levels and enjoy life the game is not 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.459
 as interesting as it is simple 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.500
 fun to watch like another dude 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.660
 supposedly breaking his neck very much 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.760
 I wonder how they all fall have fun I 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.980
 know you love when people hurt so much 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.630
 here is a game very funny and can get off 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.910
 good timekiller although there are small 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.260
 podlagivaniya because Krivorukov 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.720
 optimization developers in general 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.120

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.590

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.920
