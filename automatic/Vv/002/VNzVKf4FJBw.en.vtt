dial<00:06:32.010> office<00:06:32.280> horas<00:06:32.580> from<00:06:32.850> the<00:06:33.000> front<00:06:33.330> as<00:06:33.870> if

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:34.410 
dial office horas from the front as if

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:38.060 
dial office horas from the front as if
she's<00:06:35.070> about<00:06:35.280> to<00:06:35.490> attack<00:06:35.880> us<00:06:36.890> it's<00:06:37.890> got<00:06:38.040> a

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:38.070 
she's about to attack us it's got a

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:41.720 
she's about to attack us it's got a
really<00:06:38.580> threatening<00:06:39.360> look<00:06:39.660> to<00:06:39.900> it<00:06:40.080> and<00:06:40.730> with

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:41.730 
really threatening look to it and with

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:44.660 
really threatening look to it and with
those<00:06:41.910> teeth<00:06:42.240> on<00:06:42.450> display<00:06:42.900> and<00:06:43.470> claws<00:06:43.920> you

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:44.670 
those teeth on display and claws you

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:46.250 
those teeth on display and claws you
certainly<00:06:45.090> wouldn't<00:06:45.660> want<00:06:45.780> to<00:06:45.930> meet<00:06:46.050> this

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:46.260 
certainly wouldn't want to meet this

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.070 
certainly wouldn't want to meet this
thing<00:06:46.590> in<00:06:47.220> a<00:06:47.340> dark<00:06:47.610> alley

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080 
thing in a dark alley

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.330 
thing in a dark alley
so<00:06:49.080> the<00:06:49.200> original<00:06:49.290> maquette<00:06:49.950> would<00:06:50.130> have<00:06:50.220> been

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:50.340 
so the original maquette would have been

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.120 
so the original maquette would have been
approved<00:06:50.610> by<00:06:50.820> Steven<00:06:51.240> Spielberg<00:06:52.040> for<00:06:53.040> the

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:53.130 
approved by Steven Spielberg for the

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:54.980 
approved by Steven Spielberg for the
design<00:06:53.460> of<00:06:53.490> the<00:06:53.760> Dilophosaurus<00:06:54.420> that<00:06:54.600> we<00:06:54.720> see

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:54.990 
design of the Dilophosaurus that we see

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:59.450 
design of the Dilophosaurus that we see
in<00:06:55.260> the<00:06:55.530> film<00:06:56.300> so<00:06:57.300> this<00:06:57.510> mold<00:06:58.160> would<00:06:59.160> have<00:06:59.310> had

00:06:59.450 --> 00:06:59.460 
in the film so this mold would have had

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.120 
in the film so this mold would have had
its<00:06:59.610> eyes<00:06:59.820> laid<00:07:00.480> on<00:07:00.690> by<00:07:00.990> Steven<00:07:01.380> Spielberg<00:07:01.890> and

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:02.130 
its eyes laid on by Steven Spielberg and

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.830 
its eyes laid on by Steven Spielberg and
that<00:07:02.370> makes<00:07:02.610> this<00:07:02.790> thing<00:07:02.850> a<00:07:03.150> real<00:07:03.360> pleasure<00:07:03.660> to

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:03.840

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:05.670
