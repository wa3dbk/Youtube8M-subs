00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
there that's gonna function as my

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.120 
there that's gonna function as my
scoreboard<00:01:42.150> ok<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.049> now<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.320> have<00:01:43.409> my<00:01:43.770> whole

scoreboard ok so now I have my whole

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.030 
scoreboard ok so now I have my whole
environment<00:01:44.780> setup<00:01:45.780> ok<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:46.560> we<00:01:46.710> now<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:46.950> we

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
environment setup ok so we now that we

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.980 
environment setup ok so we now that we
have<00:01:47.070> our<00:01:47.189> stadium<00:01:47.670> we<00:01:47.790> have<00:01:47.820> our<00:01:48.149> environment

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
have our stadium we have our environment

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.359 
have our stadium we have our environment
let's<00:01:49.110> go<00:01:49.229> ahead<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.470> start<00:01:49.860> playing<00:01:50.100> soccer

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
so you can actually play two player ad

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.370 
so you can actually play two player ad
hoc<00:01:53.430> or<00:01:53.640> through<00:01:54.149> infrastructure<00:01:54.299> as<00:01:54.720> well<00:01:54.750> so

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
hoc or through infrastructure as well so

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.649 
hoc or through infrastructure as well so
you<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.890> beat<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.219> one<00:01:56.430> set<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.729> cards<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.180> then

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
you to beat is one set of cards and then

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.990 
you to beat is one set of cards and then
the<00:01:58.020> experience<00:01:58.530> is<00:01:58.680> however<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:59.399> mean<00:01:59.640> you

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
the experience is however you mean you

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.670 
the experience is however you mean you
maneuver<00:02:00.360> around<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.719> playing<00:02:00.960> field<00:02:01.229> it

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
maneuver around the playing field it

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.859 
maneuver around the playing field it
remembers<00:02:02.009> where<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.549> cards<00:02:02.909> are<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:03.659> can

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
remembers where the cards are so you can

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.080 
remembers where the cards are so you can
go<00:02:03.990> ahead<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.170> zoom<00:02:04.350> in

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
go ahead and zoom in

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.730 
go ahead and zoom in
and<00:02:05.210> get<00:02:05.479> really<00:02:05.750> close<00:02:05.899> to<00:02:06.020> the<00:02:06.049> field<00:02:06.350> zoom

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
and get really close to the field zoom

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.219 
and get really close to the field zoom
back<00:02:06.950> out<00:02:07.189> and<00:02:07.520> then<00:02:08.030> it<00:02:08.599> keeps<00:02:08.899> everything

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
back out and then it keeps everything

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.110 
back out and then it keeps everything
within<00:02:09.590> context<00:02:10.280> within<00:02:10.489> the<00:02:10.729> context<00:02:11.060> of

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
within context within the context of

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.030 
within context within the context of
playing<00:02:11.420> field<00:02:11.629> so<00:02:11.989> as<00:02:12.170> you<00:02:12.319> can<00:02:12.440> see<00:02:12.650> it

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
playing field so as you can see it

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.940 
playing field so as you can see it
actually<00:02:13.160> does<00:02:13.519> it<00:02:14.090> does<00:02:14.360> factor<00:02:14.629> in<00:02:15.050> the<00:02:15.650> size

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
actually does it does factor in the size

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.220 
actually does it does factor in the size
of<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.340> playing<00:02:16.610> space<00:02:16.970> it<00:02:17.330> factors<00:02:17.599> in<00:02:17.989> the

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
of the playing space it factors in the

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.050 
of the playing space it factors in the
velocity<00:02:18.920> about<00:02:19.160> where<00:02:19.519> you<00:02:19.610> touch<00:02:19.790> it<00:02:19.910> how
