00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
that I think it's for attention honestly

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.420 
that I think it's for attention honestly
I<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.629> know<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:57.780> don't<00:00:57.930> see<00:00:58.260> why<00:00:58.440> somebody<00:00:58.890> you

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
I you know I don't see why somebody you

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.830 
I you know I don't see why somebody you
know<00:00:59.550> would<00:00:59.699> do<00:00:59.820> that<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.000> think<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.539> there's

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
know would do that I think that there's

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.599 
know would do that I think that there's
you<00:01:01.020> know<00:01:01.140> definitely<00:01:01.590> rumors<00:01:01.980> out<00:01:02.190> there<00:01:02.250> and

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
you know definitely rumors out there and

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:03.770 
you know definitely rumors out there and
there's<00:01:02.730> lots<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.000> things<00:01:03.059> going<00:01:03.329> on<00:01:03.570> but

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
there's lots of things going on but

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.509 
there's lots of things going on but
there's<00:01:03.960> nothing<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:05.040> know<00:01:05.159> at<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.400> point

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
there's nothing you know at this point

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.920 
there's nothing you know at this point
right<00:01:05.790> now<00:01:05.850> like<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.180> told<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.450> guy<00:01:06.659> we<00:01:06.810> have<00:01:06.900> a

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
right now like I told that guy we have a

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.330 
right now like I told that guy we have a
contract<00:01:07.260> with<00:01:07.380> James<00:01:07.619> Stewart<00:01:07.920> he<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.159> not

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
contract with James Stewart he is not

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.770 
contract with James Stewart he is not
showing<00:01:08.549> up<00:01:08.729> racing<00:01:08.970> their<00:01:09.210> bike<00:01:09.360> today<00:01:09.540> it's

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
showing up racing their bike today it's

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.899 
showing up racing their bike today it's
impossible<00:01:10.350> so<00:01:10.950> why<00:01:11.130> would<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.369> why<00:01:11.880> would

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
impossible so why would you why would

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.550 
impossible so why would you why would
you<00:01:12.180> do<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.330> that's<00:01:12.659> my<00:01:12.810> opinion<00:01:13.110> but<00:01:13.409> you

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
you do that that's my opinion but you

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.450 
you do that that's my opinion but you
know<00:01:13.650> he<00:01:13.770> can<00:01:13.890> do<00:01:13.950> what<00:01:14.040> he<00:01:14.070> wants<00:01:14.130> he's

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
know he can do what he wants he's

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.920 
know he can do what he wants he's
getting<00:01:14.670> attention<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.450> guess<00:01:15.750> that's

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
getting attention and I guess that's

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.060 
getting attention and I guess that's
what<00:01:16.020> he<00:01:16.110> wanted<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:16.380> that's<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.860> know<00:01:16.890> it's

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
what he wanted so that's you know it's

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.289 
what he wanted so that's you know it's
fine<00:01:17.189> for<00:01:17.369> him<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.610> his<00:01:17.670> sponsors<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.150> guess

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
fine for him and his sponsors I guess

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.719 
fine for him and his sponsors I guess
well<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.990> know<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.320> don't<00:01:19.650> really<00:01:19.830> don't<00:01:20.070> you

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.360 
own training program so you know it's
hard<00:03:53.990> at<00:03:54.170> that<00:03:54.290> point<00:03:54.560> we<00:03:54.620> want<00:03:54.890> to<00:03:55.010> step<00:03:55.190> up

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
hard at that point we want to step up

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.850 
hard at that point we want to step up
the<00:03:55.520> next<00:03:55.730> level<00:03:56.290> so<00:03:57.290> that<00:03:57.320> was<00:03:57.500> really<00:03:57.530> what

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
the next level so that was really what

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.980 
the next level so that was really what
we<00:03:57.950> had<00:03:58.070> to<00:03:58.160> give<00:03:58.310> up<00:03:58.490> and<00:03:58.700> you<00:03:59.450> know<00:03:59.570> for<00:03:59.780> Davey

00:03:59.980 --> 00:03:59.990 
we had to give up and you know for Davey

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.930 
we had to give up and you know for Davey
you<00:04:00.590> know<00:04:00.680> we<00:04:00.800> let<00:04:00.950> him<00:04:01.070> not<00:04:01.370> live<00:04:01.580> there<00:04:01.610> now

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.280 
you know we let him not live there now
