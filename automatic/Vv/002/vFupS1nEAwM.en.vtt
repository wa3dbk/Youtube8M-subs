00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:17.240 
it is a lot of little steps and

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
script and activate it in two ways one

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.490 
script and activate it in two ways one
is<00:00:33.960> just<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.410> drag<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.190> from<00:00:35.579> your<00:00:36.180> desktop<00:00:36.960> on

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
is just to drag it from your desktop on

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.229 
is just to drag it from your desktop on
to<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.860> viewport<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.610> that's<00:00:38.820> actually

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
to the viewport and that's actually

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.180 
to the viewport and that's actually
going<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.660> automatically<00:00:40.350> launch<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.890> script

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
going to automatically launch the script

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.340 
going to automatically launch the script
or<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:42.059> could<00:00:42.210> drop<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.570> script<00:00:42.840> in<00:00:42.989> a

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
or you could drop the script in a

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.470 
or you could drop the script in a
specific<00:00:43.680> directory<00:00:44.160> so<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.610> Maya<00:00:44.940> can<00:00:45.180> find

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
specific directory so that Maya can find

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.510 
specific directory so that Maya can find
it<00:00:45.629> every<00:00:45.899> time<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.200> launch<00:00:46.379> Maya<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:47.010> would

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
it every time you launch Maya it would

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.389 
it every time you launch Maya it would
be<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.850> users<00:00:48.239> directory<00:00:49.010> with<00:00:50.010> your<00:00:50.190> name

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
be the users directory with your name

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.420 
be the users directory with your name
and<00:00:50.730> then<00:00:51.180> within<00:00:51.539> documents<00:00:51.920> Maya<00:00:52.920> the

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
and then within documents Maya the

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.189 
and then within documents Maya the
version<00:00:53.789> number<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.300> then<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.960> script

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
version number and then the script

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.930 
version number and then the script
subdirectory<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.980> what<00:00:56.489> this<00:00:56.610> will<00:00:56.730> do<00:00:56.910> is

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
subdirectory and what this will do is

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.520 
subdirectory and what this will do is
source<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.570> script<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.109> it's<00:00:58.410> available

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
source the script so that it's available

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.979 
source the script so that it's available
for<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.579> access<00:01:00.030> whenever<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.480> want<00:01:00.690> if

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989

for you to access whenever you want if
you're<00:01:01.590> accessing<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.160> script<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.460> this<00:01:02.579> way

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
you're accessing the script in this way

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.549 
you're accessing the script in this way
and<00:01:03.539> this<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.809> same<00:01:04.049> with<00:01:04.170> most<00:01:04.379> other

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.740 
now these controls are set up just like
I've<00:01:39.659> done<00:01:39.720> in<00:01:40.229> my<00:01:40.560> FK<00:01:41.090> creation<00:01:42.090> tutorial

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
I've done in my FK creation tutorial

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.630 
I've done in my FK creation tutorial
except<00:01:43.350> for<00:01:43.500> rather<00:01:43.799> than<00:01:44.040> using<00:01:44.340> direct

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
except for rather than using direct

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.969 
except for rather than using direct
connections<00:01:45.119> I'm<00:01:45.420> tying<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.320> controls<00:01:46.770> to

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
connections I'm tying the controls to

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.740 
connections I'm tying the controls to
the<00:01:47.070> joints<00:01:47.369> using<00:01:47.670> constraints<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.630> I

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
the joints using constraints and I

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.940 
the joints using constraints and I
should<00:01:48.899> also<00:01:48.990> mention<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.560> if<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:49.829> have

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
should also mention that if you have

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.969 
should also mention that if you have
other<00:01:50.520> joints<00:01:50.970> in<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.479> character<00:01:52.200> rig<00:01:52.439> that

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
other joints in the character rig that

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.620 
other joints in the character rig that
are<00:01:53.130> not<00:01:53.310> receiving<00:01:53.610> these<00:01:53.850> FK<00:01:54.210> controls

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
are not receiving these FK controls

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.660 
are not receiving these FK controls
you'll<00:01:55.290> want<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.590> constrain<00:01:56.040> your<00:01:56.280> first

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
you'll want to constrain your first

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.840 
you'll want to constrain your first
offset<00:01:57.390> group<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.500> parent<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.250> whatever

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
offset group to the parent of whatever

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.190 
offset group to the parent of whatever
the<00:02:00.119> first<00:02:00.329> joint<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.840> that<00:02:01.079> you're

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
the first joint is that you're

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.980 
the first joint is that you're
controlling<00:02:01.619> so<00:02:02.189> in<00:02:02.280> this<00:02:02.399> case<00:02:02.670> I'm

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
controlling so in this case I'm

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.840 
controlling so in this case I'm
controlling<00:02:03.990> joint<00:02:04.350> three<00:02:04.710> so<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.460> parent

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
controlling joint three so the parent

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.999 
controlling joint three so the parent
object<00:02:06.030> is<00:02:06.420> joint<00:02:06.689> two<00:02:06.960> so<00:02:07.350> I'd<00:02:07.469> select<00:02:07.770> joint

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
object is joint two so I'd select joint

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.029 
object is joint two so I'd select joint
two<00:02:08.509> toggle<00:02:09.509> select<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.869> offset<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.560> do

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
two toggle select the offset and do

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.070 
two toggle select the offset and do
constrain<00:02:11.700> parent<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.360> that<00:02:12.599> would<00:02:12.840> ensure

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
constrain parent and that would ensure

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.670 
constrain parent and that would ensure
that<00:02:13.110> Mike

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
that Mike

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.800 
that Mike
all<00:02:13.769> rig<00:02:14.069> follows<00:02:14.849> the<00:02:15.030> movement<00:02:15.390> of<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.659> rest

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
all rig follows the movement of the rest

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.530 
all rig follows the movement of the rest
of<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:15.989> skeleton<00:02:16.439> so<00:02:16.909> I<00:02:17.909> hope<00:02:18.180> this<00:02:18.269> little

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
of the skeleton so I hope this little

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.149 
of the skeleton so I hope this little
tool<00:02:18.659> is<00:02:18.840> handy<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.349> if<00:02:19.829> you're<00:02:20.010> interested

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
tool is handy and if you're interested

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:22.220 
tool is handy and if you're interested
