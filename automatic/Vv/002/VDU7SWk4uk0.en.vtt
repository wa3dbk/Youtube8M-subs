00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:10.080
 I have a philosophy I always do 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.610
 easier or harder 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.929
 so we do that or if we do that so there 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.470
 i 'm going to check i'm going to look at the 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.470
 light table 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.939
 I define myself as a publisher a 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.539
 artist me I am unable to do 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.880
 a drawing 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.830
 I am totally unable to make a 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.899
 drawing so there is still a little point 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.239
 a small point that everywhere I sure 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.450
 I am disappointed and a kind of hybrid 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:43.020
 that is to say that I master the 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:46.100
 serigraphy and game I try to 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.100
 to understand our artist's soul 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:48.690
 I perceive I do not like it the most 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.969
 simple 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.739
 I was working on my pictures at the beginning 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.289
 one on my photographs that I traffic 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.530
 and in color like that with colors 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.780
 silkscreen and but very quickly I 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.969
 I'm told it's not my voice at 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.240
 staff and I wanted to go further 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.220
 and so suddenly I bought a 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.700
 little bit of material I've been seeing the 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.900
 galleries the artists and then small to 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.000
 I met some people 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.650
 some very good meetings and that's it 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.840
 then after that it's really a job at 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.820
 day to day meet this or that 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.299
 a job missed balls or start again 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.110
 to zero 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.549
 to do an experiment because the 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.729
 screen printing is a very simple process 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.020
 a priori we have a stencil a slow she 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.320
 goes where she does not go it seems very 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.509
 simple but at every step one has to be 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.100
 vigilant so as to make no 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.720
 fault 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.720
 to make a film a priori is enough 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.820
 simple black film that is called here 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.500
 this the artwork after me I'll do 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.299
 the screen from the movie is enough 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.670
 simple on what had stretched a fabric the 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.020
 cloth it's scrolling between the yarns 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.520
 have holes and his troops are going 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.429
 let pass the year 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.700
 there we have that I called the little bridge and 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:05.439
 the coupon i'm going to reach them 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.090
 photographically I'll soul and 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:11.230
 on a film it's a gelatin 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.480
 photographic that is to say sensitive to 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.530
 light precisely the light of these 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:21.760
 lamps I close 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:24.940
 it's going to make noise again I 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.269
 can evacuate for just damaged 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.269
 the lamps 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.990
 lmc transparent of the light passes acts 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.150
 on the film it does not harden 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.850
 after when I'm going to spend the halo film 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.660
 and if I forget something it's 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.140
 annoying when we see that it goes 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:52.210
 really there is going to dissolve that this 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:55.500
 which corresponds to black so it holds by 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.540
 capillarity there is no magic that's 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.540
 totally chemical 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.540
 c 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.510
 so there the support of the film goes away and 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:10.400
 so now 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:14.870
 the emulsion she went to stick in 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.159
 the screen so the beach and do all the 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.709
 tower 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:21.439
 that's how it's going to shut up when this 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.510
 will be everyone when the product will be dry 

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:30.739
 under all the entourage on the mouth and 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:32.720
 I 'll be quiet to print in 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.939
 it's a job where you do not have to be 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.799
 too stressed 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:45.170
 So here it is when it's dry 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:49.240
 these loans i'm dying machine there i'm going 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:51.190
 only that 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.860
 finally now I want to set up 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.390
 I set up the artwork on the 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.320
 leaf 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:01.980
 I adjust the visual that I have there I 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:05.970
 will put it in the starting position 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.970
 so I run inked there 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.470
 here I am going to make an empty passage of 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:19.239
 way to not repress a printed 100 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:23.109
 kg and white that's how 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.109
 the screen and nappe 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:32.370
 now I put in semi automatic 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:34.909
 so the magic prints so I'm doing it again 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.909
 one immediately 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:46.710
 we're going to see if that's okay 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.240
 I'm trying to do 2-2 to open the audience 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.670
 to create the widest audience 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.980
 possible and therefore working 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.480
 in the educational and academic field 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.540
 for me it is very important 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:00.450
 the day when there really will be one of 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:03.330
 parades of students in museums because 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.200
 that it's the future that's what fears 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.140
 public of the future 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.830
 and there I will consider that I have that I 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.830
 succeeded something
