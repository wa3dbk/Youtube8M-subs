planning on building one of these for a

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.750 
planning on building one of these for a
while<00:00:16.250> but<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.580> guy<00:00:18.180> on<00:00:18.390> YouTube<00:00:19.160> kind<00:00:20.160> of<00:00:20.310> used

while but a guy on YouTube kind of used

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.609 
while but a guy on YouTube kind of used
similar<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.449> my<00:00:21.570> design<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:21.869> haven't<00:00:22.230> posted<00:00:22.350> my

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
similar to my design I haven't posted my

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.290 
similar to my design I haven't posted my
design<00:00:22.920> so<00:00:23.100> he<00:00:23.220> thought<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.550> up

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
design so he thought it up

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.000 
design so he thought it up
it<00:00:24.630> was<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:26.119> he's<00:00:27.119> dry<00:00:27.630> ice<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.289> water<00:00:28.590> I

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
it was a he's dry ice and water I

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.110 
it was a he's dry ice and water I
believe<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.670> what<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:30.000> was<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:31.550> it<00:00:32.550> had<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.790> fan

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
believe is what it was and it had a fan

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.030 
believe is what it was and it had a fan
blowing<00:00:33.420> over<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.899> anyway<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.440> looked

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
blowing over it anyway and it looked

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.650 
blowing over it anyway and it looked
cool<00:00:35.250> then<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.610> cooled<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.030> down<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.540> was

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
cool then it cooled it down and it was

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.750 
cool then it cooled it down and it was
powerful<00:00:36.989> but<00:00:37.320> I'm<00:00:37.890> hoping<00:00:38.250> this<00:00:38.430> will<00:00:38.579> be<00:00:38.640> a

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
powerful but I'm hoping this will be a

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.170 
powerful but I'm hoping this will be a
little<00:00:39.000> more<00:00:39.379> mmm<00:00:40.440> not<00:00:41.129> even<00:00:41.370> sophisticated

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
little more mmm not even sophisticated

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.979 
little more mmm not even sophisticated
just<00:00:42.270> overly<00:00:42.840> complicated<00:00:43.379> there<00:00:43.739> we<00:00:43.860> go

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
just overly complicated there we go

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.209 
just overly complicated there we go
anyway<00:00:46.039> I<00:00:47.039> have<00:00:47.660> first<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.840> all<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.950> I'm

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
anyway I have first of all it is a I'm

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.709 
anyway I have first of all it is a I'm
calling<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.700> homemade<00:00:51.059> liquid<00:00:51.420> nitrogen

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
battery pack I'm thinking to 6 volt

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.450 
battery pack I'm thinking to 6 volt
Lantern<00:01:22.439> batteries<00:01:22.680> like

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:36.390 

like<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:33.600> two<00:01:34.600> of<00:01:34.780> them<00:01:34.990> did<00:01:35.800> give<00:01:35.920> me<00:01:36.010> the<00:01:36.040> 12

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
like this two of them did give me the 12

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.060 
like this two of them did give me the 12
volts<00:01:36.700> needed<00:01:37.270> to<00:01:37.600> power<00:01:37.780> a<00:01:37.960> supp<00:01:38.670> boats<00:01:39.670> up<00:01:39.940> a

radiator out of a motorcycle or a very
small<00:01:51.369> car<00:01:52.440> a<00:01:53.440> fan<00:01:54.479> I'll<00:01:55.479> probably<00:01:55.810> build<00:01:56.110> it

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
small car a fan I'll probably build it

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.960 
small car a fan I'll probably build it
in<00:01:56.380> the<00:01:56.500> box<00:01:56.710> and<00:01:56.950> I<00:01:57.010> think<00:01:57.280> I<00:01:57.369> have<00:01:57.550> the<00:01:57.670> blade

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
in the box and I think I have the blade

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.270 
in the box and I think I have the blade
picked<00:01:58.270> out<00:01:58.479> and<00:02:00.899> think<00:02:01.899> then<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:02.590> homemade

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
picked out and think then the homemade

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.310 
picked out and think then the homemade
liquid<00:02:03.670> nitrogen<00:02:04.060> and<00:02:04.509> then<00:02:04.630> anything<00:02:04.869> else<00:02:05.110> I

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
liquid nitrogen and then anything else I

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.660 
liquid nitrogen and then anything else I
found<00:02:05.500> that<00:02:05.710> I<00:02:05.740> just<00:02:05.950> need<00:02:06.190> probably<00:02:06.550> like

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
found that I just need probably like

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.639 
found that I just need probably like
silicon<00:02:07.210> and<00:02:07.450> that<00:02:07.570> sort<00:02:07.750> of<00:02:07.780> stuff

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
silicon and that sort of stuff

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.510 
silicon and that sort of stuff
anyway<00:02:09.160> the<00:02:09.340> plans<00:02:09.610> are<00:02:10.739> I'll<00:02:11.739> take<00:02:12.310> the

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
anyway the plans are I'll take the

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.340 
anyway the plans are I'll take the
cooler<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:13.150> this<00:02:13.540> is<00:02:13.690> just<00:02:13.840> a<00:02:13.930> cooler<00:02:14.110> part

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
cooler and this is just a cooler part

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.500 
cooler and this is just a cooler part
and<00:02:14.470> attach<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.920> legs<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:15.850> battery<00:02:16.209> pack

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
and attach the legs the battery pack

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.390 
and attach the legs the battery pack
will<00:02:16.780> be<00:02:16.870> slightly<00:02:19.560> shorter<00:02:20.560> than<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.070> legs

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
will be slightly shorter than the legs

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.040 
will be slightly shorter than the legs
I'll<00:02:21.700> probably<00:02:21.910> have<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.150> batteries<00:02:22.480> mounted

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
I'll probably have the batteries mounted

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.150 
I'll probably have the batteries mounted
like<00:02:23.200> this<00:02:23.440> on<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.709> bottom<00:02:23.920> of<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.040> cooler

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
like this on the bottom of the cooler

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.320 
like this on the bottom of the cooler
and<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.489> legs<00:02:24.700> will<00:02:24.880> be<00:02:24.970> just<00:02:25.209> slightly

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
and the legs will be just slightly

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.830 
and the legs will be just slightly
longer<00:02:25.810> so<00:02:26.140> they'll<00:02:26.290> hold<00:02:26.500> it<00:02:26.620> up<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:28.000> then

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
longer so they'll hold it up and then

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.330 
longer so they'll hold it up and then
that<00:02:29.020> will<00:02:29.200> key<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:29.500> battery<00:02:29.800> pack<00:02:30.040> all<00:02:30.220> right

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
that will key the battery pack all right

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.140 
that will key the battery pack all right
in<00:02:30.520> the<00:02:30.760> cooler

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
in the cooler

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.420 
in the cooler
I<00:02:31.330> will<00:02:31.930> have<00:02:32.140> my<00:02:32.410> homemade<00:02:32.830> liquid<00:02:33.130> nitrogen

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
I will have my homemade liquid nitrogen

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.930 
I will have my homemade liquid nitrogen
which<00:02:33.730> I<00:02:33.820> will<00:02:33.940> discuss<00:02:34.269> in<00:02:34.390> a<00:02:34.450> second<00:02:34.810> a<00:02:35.940> pop

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
which I will discuss in a second a pop

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.820 
which I will discuss in a second a pop
motor<00:02:37.330> I'm<00:02:37.600> worried<00:02:38.110> about<00:02:38.170> this<00:02:38.440> because<00:02:38.739> of

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
motor I'm worried about this because of

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.440 
motor I'm worried about this because of
how<00:02:38.950> cold<00:02:39.250> this<00:02:39.580> is<00:02:39.730> going<00:02:39.970> to<00:02:40.120> be<00:02:40.239> it's<00:02:40.420> not

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
how cold this is going to be it's not

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.590 
how cold this is going to be it's not
real<00:02:40.810> liquid<00:02:41.080> nitrogen<00:02:41.500> but<00:02:41.739> how<00:02:41.890> cold<00:02:42.190> it<00:02:42.310> is

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
real liquid nitrogen but how cold it is

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.240 
real liquid nitrogen but how cold it is
I've<00:02:43.600> never<00:02:43.870> used<00:02:44.230> an<00:02:44.440> electronic<00:02:44.890> motor

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
I've never used an electronic motor

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.140 
I've never used an electronic motor
under<00:02:46.860> -<00:02:47.860> I<00:02:48.280> don't<00:02:48.549> even<00:02:48.640> know<00:02:48.850> if<00:02:48.880> it's<00:02:49.090> a

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
under - I don't even know if it's a

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.900 
under - I don't even know if it's a
hundred<00:02:49.420> or<00:02:49.600> 200<00:02:49.780> degrees<00:02:50.380> but<00:02:50.560> it's<00:02:50.730> right<00:02:51.730> up

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
hundred or 200 degrees but it's right up

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.199 
hundred or 200 degrees but it's right up
there<00:02:52.950> then<00:02:53.950> I<00:02:53.980> also<00:02:54.280> have<00:02:54.670> some<00:02:54.700> sort<00:02:55.120> of

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
there then I also have some sort of

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:56.750 
there then I also have some sort of
small<00:02:55.510> plastic<00:02:56.019> or<00:02:56.170> metal<00:02:56.230> container

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
small plastic or metal container

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.479 
small plastic or metal container
circular<00:02:58.350> four<00:02:59.350> that's<00:02:59.650> for<00:02:59.890> the<00:02:59.950> process<00:03:00.400> of

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
circular four that's for the process of

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.039 
circular four that's for the process of
making<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:01.000> homemade<00:03:01.299> liquid<00:03:01.570> nitrogen<00:03:01.870> I'll

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
making the homemade liquid nitrogen I'll

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:03.330 
making the homemade liquid nitrogen I'll
explain<00:03:02.260> that<00:03:02.440> it<00:03:02.530> just<00:03:02.709> has<00:03:02.830> holes<00:03:03.070> drilled

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
explain that it just has holes drilled

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.470 
explain that it just has holes drilled
in<00:03:03.459> it<00:03:03.489> and<00:03:03.850> then<00:03:04.860> copper<00:03:05.860> pipe<00:03:06.100> this<00:03:07.090> can<00:03:07.330> be

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
in it and then copper pipe this can be

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.470 
in it and then copper pipe this can be
silicon<00:03:07.930> pipe<00:03:08.140> but<00:03:08.290> up<00:03:08.380> here<00:03:08.410> so<00:03:08.769> the<00:03:09.120> that<00:03:10.120> is

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
silicon pipe but up here so the that is

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.380 
silicon pipe but up here so the that is
a<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:13.540> hold<00:03:14.410> it<00:03:14.530> having<00:03:14.980> a<00:03:15.040> brain<00:03:15.190> fart<00:03:15.430> the

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
a the hold it having a brain fart the

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.569 
a the hold it having a brain fart the
radiator<00:03:16.870> there's<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:17.739> fan<00:03:17.980> and<00:03:18.220> there's<00:03:18.400> the

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
radiator there's the fan and there's the

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:20.100 
radiator there's the fan and there's the
copper<00:03:19.000> pipe<00:03:19.150> return<00:03:19.450> and<00:03:19.660> I<00:03:19.690> have<00:03:19.810> a<00:03:19.840> close-up

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
copper pipe return and I have a close-up

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.350 
copper pipe return and I have a close-up
I'll<00:03:20.380> discuss<00:03:20.709> here<00:03:20.950> so<00:03:21.489> that's<00:03:21.940> the<00:03:22.030> return

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
I'll discuss here so that's the return

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.590 
I'll discuss here so that's the return
just<00:03:22.630> comes<00:03:22.840> back<00:03:22.900> in<00:03:23.340> here's<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.760> looking<00:03:25.480> at

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
just comes back in here's the looking at

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.229 
just comes back in here's the looking at
the<00:03:25.810> back<00:03:26.079> of<00:03:26.350> it<00:03:26.590> and<00:03:26.980> you<00:03:27.130> have<00:03:27.310> the<00:03:27.549> it<00:03:28.000> has

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
the back of it and you have the it has

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.819 
the back of it and you have the it has
to<00:03:28.269> suck<00:03:28.720> the<00:03:28.930> air<00:03:29.079> through<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:31.829> burst

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
to suck the air through the burst

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:37.319 
to suck the air through the burst
through<00:03:33.280> and<00:03:33.459> around<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:35.500> radiator<00:03:35.950> and<00:03:36.329> then

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
through and around the radiator and then

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.090 
through and around the radiator and then
there's<00:03:37.540> a<00:03:37.600> fan<00:03:37.930> you<00:03:38.200> can<00:03:38.290> see<00:03:38.470> this<00:03:38.590> is<00:03:38.739> darker

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
there's a fan you can see this is darker

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.190 
there's a fan you can see this is darker
shade<00:03:39.340> on<00:03:39.370> the<00:03:39.609> outside<00:03:39.910> that's

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
shade on the outside that's

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.190 
shade on the outside that's
fam<00:03:40.410> and<00:03:40.890> then<00:03:41.849> here's<00:03:42.150> this<00:03:42.360> the<00:03:42.599> return<00:03:42.750> this

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
fam and then here's this the return this

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.650 
fam and then here's this the return this
is<00:03:43.379> the<00:03:43.560> take<00:03:44.250> in<00:03:44.519> and<00:03:44.849> this<00:03:44.940> is<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.150> return

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
is the take in and this is the return

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.309 
is the take in and this is the return
for<00:03:46.050> the<00:03:47.000> radiator<00:03:48.000> here's<00:03:48.480> a<00:03:48.540> fan<00:03:48.930> and<00:03:49.230> in

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
for the radiator here's a fan and in

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:50.750 
for the radiator here's a fan and in
front<00:03:49.500> of<00:03:49.590> it<00:03:49.680> others<00:03:49.890> have<00:03:50.069> a<00:03:50.190> copper<00:03:50.580> pipe

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
front of it others have a copper pipe

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.640 
front of it others have a copper pipe
which<00:03:51.030> will<00:03:51.180> also<00:03:51.480> kind<00:03:51.720> of<00:03:51.810> cool<00:03:51.989> it<00:03:52.230> but<00:03:52.379> not

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
which will also kind of cool it but not

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:53.390 
which will also kind of cool it but not
that<00:03:52.860> much

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
that much

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.360 
that much
you<00:03:53.819> stay<00:03:54.000> copper<00:03:54.330> pipe<00:03:54.510> for<00:03:54.720> the<00:03:54.750> return

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
you stay copper pipe for the return

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.130 
you stay copper pipe for the return
being<00:03:56.370> in<00:03:56.519> front<00:03:56.670> of<00:03:56.730> a<00:03:56.790> fan<00:03:56.970> so<00:03:57.630> it's<00:03:57.989> just

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
being in front of a fan so it's just

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.750 
being in front of a fan so it's just
gonna<00:03:58.319> have<00:03:58.560> it's<00:03:59.040> gonna<00:03:59.190> blow

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
gonna have it's gonna blow

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.300 
gonna have it's gonna blow
suck<00:04:00.090> in<00:04:00.300> through<00:04:00.630> the<00:04:00.780> radiator<00:04:01.200> and<00:04:01.530> that

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
suck in through the radiator and that

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.530 
suck in through the radiator and that
will<00:04:02.459> obviously<00:04:02.730> chill<00:04:03.239> the<00:04:03.360> air

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
will obviously chill the air

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.370 
will obviously chill the air
considerably<00:04:05.150> then<00:04:06.150> now<00:04:06.660> I'm<00:04:06.840> down<00:04:07.110> to<00:04:07.170> the

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
considerably then now I'm down to the

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.020 
considerably then now I'm down to the
process<00:04:07.739> of<00:04:07.890> the<00:04:08.010> liquid<00:04:08.310> nitrogen<00:04:08.430> because<00:04:08.940> I

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
process of the liquid nitrogen because I

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.930 
process of the liquid nitrogen because I
think<00:04:09.090> I've<00:04:09.299> explained<00:04:09.780> it<00:04:09.959> pretty<00:04:10.530> well<00:04:10.940> this

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
think I've explained it pretty well this

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.030 
think I've explained it pretty well this
was<00:04:12.120> not<00:04:12.299> my<00:04:12.480> idea<00:04:12.510> there<00:04:13.200> is<00:04:13.230> a<00:04:13.319> YouTube<00:04:13.739> video

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
was not my idea there is a YouTube video

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.520 
was not my idea there is a YouTube video
called<00:04:14.310> redneck<00:04:14.670> liquid<00:04:15.209> nitrogen<00:04:15.540> it<00:04:16.229> is<00:04:16.410> a

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
called redneck liquid nitrogen it is a

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.680 
called redneck liquid nitrogen it is a
school<00:04:17.010> teacher<00:04:17.310> or<00:04:17.489> chemist<00:04:18.090> or<00:04:18.269> something

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
school teacher or chemist or something

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.449 
school teacher or chemist or something
like<00:04:18.870> that<00:04:19.079> that<00:04:19.290> makes<00:04:19.530> it<00:04:19.739> he<00:04:19.859> tells<00:04:20.130> you<00:04:20.280> not

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
like that that makes it he tells you not

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.159 
like that that makes it he tells you not
to<00:04:20.519> do<00:04:20.820> it<00:04:20.970> if<00:04:21.090> you're<00:04:21.180> not<00:04:21.239> supervising<00:04:22.049> if

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
to do it if you're not supervising if

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.680 
to do it if you're not supervising if
you're<00:04:22.290> under<00:04:22.530> the<00:04:22.620> ages<00:04:22.950> of<00:04:22.979> 18<00:04:23.460> well<00:04:24.090> all<00:04:24.630> of

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
you're under the ages of 18 well all of

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.060 
you're under the ages of 18 well all of
that<00:04:25.050> will<00:04:25.260> be<00:04:25.290> done<00:04:27.169> but<00:04:28.169> basically<00:04:28.560> he<00:04:28.830> took

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
that will be done but basically he took

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.700 
that will be done but basically he took
a<00:04:29.340> container<00:04:30.240> and<00:04:30.540> placed<00:04:31.169> a<00:04:31.320> smaller

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
a container and placed a smaller

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.000 
a container and placed a smaller
container<00:04:31.979> in<00:04:32.370> it<00:04:32.490> and<00:04:32.700> as<00:04:33.479> for<00:04:33.900> the<00:04:34.139> conduct

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
container in it and as for the conduct

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.790 
container in it and as for the conduct
the<00:04:35.310> liquid<00:04:36.030> conductor<00:04:36.600> heat<00:04:36.810> conductor<00:04:37.320> he

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
the liquid conductor heat conductor he

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.040 
the liquid conductor heat conductor he
is<00:04:37.919> 99%<00:04:38.580> rubbing<00:04:38.940> alcohol<00:04:39.270> or<00:04:39.630> isopropyl

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
is 99% rubbing alcohol or isopropyl

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.650 
is 99% rubbing alcohol or isopropyl
alcohol<00:04:40.470> and<00:04:41.000> then<00:04:42.000> he<00:04:42.150> placed<00:04:42.419> in<00:04:42.570> the

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
alcohol and then he placed in the

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.210 
alcohol and then he placed in the
smaller<00:04:42.930> container<00:04:43.200> container<00:04:43.860> which<00:04:44.070> has

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
smaller container container which has

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.969 
smaller container container which has
holes<00:04:44.490> drilled<00:04:44.850> in<00:04:45.030> him<00:04:45.150> dry<00:04:45.870> ice<00:04:46.110> what<00:04:46.830> that

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
holes drilled in him dry ice what that

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:51.379 
holes drilled in him dry ice what that
does<00:04:47.160> is<00:04:47.340> when<00:04:47.490> the<00:04:47.669> dry<00:04:47.880> ice<00:04:48.090> um<00:04:50.389> evaporates

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
does is when the dry ice um evaporates

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:54.260 
does is when the dry ice um evaporates
into<00:04:51.930> the<00:04:52.110> carbon<00:04:52.950> dioxide<00:04:53.370> the<00:04:53.940> rubbing

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
into the carbon dioxide the rubbing

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.820 
into the carbon dioxide the rubbing
alcohol<00:04:54.389> becomes<00:04:54.930> super<00:04:55.260> chilled<00:04:55.500> and<00:04:55.680> it's

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
alcohol becomes super chilled and it's

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.310 
alcohol becomes super chilled and it's
not<00:04:55.979> going<00:04:56.310> to<00:04:56.550> ice<00:04:56.940> over<00:04:57.270> because<00:04:57.510> it's<00:04:57.660> 99%

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
not going to ice over because it's 99%

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.590 
not going to ice over because it's 99%
rubbing<00:04:58.410> alcohol<00:04:58.650> if<00:04:59.580> you<00:04:59.760> use<00:04:59.910> 70<00:05:00.389> it<00:05:00.510> will

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
rubbing alcohol if you use 70 it will

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.279 
rubbing alcohol if you use 70 it will
come<00:05:00.780> a<00:05:00.810> sludge<00:05:01.639> so<00:05:02.639> anyway<00:05:03.030> the<00:05:03.630> alcohol<00:05:04.110> will

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:04.289 
come a sludge so anyway the alcohol will

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:06.230 
come a sludge so anyway the alcohol will
then<00:05:04.440> become<00:05:04.560> super<00:05:05.190> chilled<00:05:05.430> this<00:05:05.970> will<00:05:06.150> be

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
then become super chilled this will be

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.520 
then become super chilled this will be
done<00:05:06.389> in<00:05:06.539> the<00:05:06.630> cooler<00:05:06.840> that's<00:05:07.110> what<00:05:07.289> my<00:05:07.380> little

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
done in the cooler that's what my little

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.590 
done in the cooler that's what my little
containers<00:05:08.070> for<00:05:08.280> this<00:05:08.970> is<00:05:09.120> just<00:05:09.300> kind<00:05:09.479> of<00:05:09.510> a

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
containers for this is just kind of a

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.830 
containers for this is just kind of a
close-up<00:05:09.810> so<00:05:10.500> after<00:05:11.010> that<00:05:11.160> I<00:05:11.820> can<00:05:12.479> turn<00:05:12.660> on<00:05:12.690> the

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
close-up so after that I can turn on the

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.600 
close-up so after that I can turn on the
pot<00:05:13.139> and<00:05:13.410> it<00:05:13.590> will<00:05:13.710> be<00:05:13.830> right<00:05:14.100> at<00:05:14.280> a<00:05:14.370> hundred

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
pot and it will be right at a hundred

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.540 
pot and it will be right at a hundred
minus<00:05:15.150> a<00:05:15.270> hundred<00:05:15.720> you<00:05:15.930> know<00:05:16.050> maybe<00:05:16.320> minus<00:05:16.979> 200

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
minus a hundred you know maybe minus 200

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.900 
minus a hundred you know maybe minus 200
I<00:05:17.610> have<00:05:17.729> to<00:05:17.850> review<00:05:18.120> the<00:05:18.270> video<00:05:18.539> and<00:05:19.669> it<00:05:20.669> should

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
I have to review the video and it should

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.300 
I have to review the video and it should
be<00:05:21.000> really<00:05:21.270> cold<00:05:21.650> now<00:05:22.650> you<00:05:22.710> could<00:05:22.979> use<00:05:23.130> this

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
be really cold now you could use this

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.839 
be really cold now you could use this
with<00:05:23.490> technically<00:05:24.180> any<00:05:24.419> of<00:05:24.599> the<00:05:24.750> designs<00:05:25.110> on

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:25.849 
with technically any of the designs on

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:28.550 
with technically any of the designs on
YouTube<00:05:26.849> this<00:05:27.060> with<00:05:27.240> liquid<00:05:27.690> nitrogen<00:05:28.050> stuff

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
YouTube this with liquid nitrogen stuff

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.409 
YouTube this with liquid nitrogen stuff
but<00:05:28.979> I<00:05:29.220> just<00:05:29.310> like<00:05:29.700> the<00:05:30.060> ones<00:05:30.240> with<00:05:30.389> the

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419 
but I just like the ones with the

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:32.150 
but I just like the ones with the
radiators<00:05:31.020> so<00:05:31.110> I<00:05:31.169> drew<00:05:31.349> this<00:05:31.500> up<00:05:31.680> real<00:05:31.889> quick

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
radiators so I drew this up real quick

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.379 
radiators so I drew this up real quick
and

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:33.389 
and

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:36.679 
and
yeah<00:05:34.139> so<00:05:34.590> any<00:05:34.860> questions<00:05:35.599> comments<00:05:36.599> or

00:05:36.679 --> 00:05:36.689 
yeah so any questions comments or

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:39.649 
yeah so any questions comments or
concerns<00:05:36.870> please<00:05:37.590> tell<00:05:38.219> me<00:05:38.400> I'm<00:05:39.180> taking<00:05:39.539> all

00:05:39.649 --> 00:05:39.659 
concerns please tell me I'm taking all

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:41.240 
concerns please tell me I'm taking all
the<00:05:39.750> ideas<00:05:40.080> and<00:05:40.110> probably<00:05:40.680> won't<00:05:40.830> finish<00:05:41.009> this

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
the ideas and probably won't finish this

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.399 
the ideas and probably won't finish this
I<00:05:41.400> have<00:05:41.550> to<00:05:41.669> do<00:05:41.789> this<00:05:41.909> project<00:05:42.270> entirely<00:05:42.900> free

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:43.409 
I have to do this project entirely free

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:46.159 
I have to do this project entirely free
so<00:05:44.280> I<00:05:44.580> got<00:05:44.729> to<00:05:44.819> go<00:05:44.909> find<00:05:45.120> some<00:05:45.330> copper<00:05:45.689> pipe<00:05:45.900> and

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:46.169 
so I got to go find some copper pipe and

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:47.929 
so I got to go find some copper pipe and
a<00:05:46.259> radiator<00:05:46.740> I<00:05:47.039> pretty<00:05:47.430> much<00:05:47.520> have<00:05:47.819> everything

00:05:47.929 --> 00:05:47.939 
a radiator I pretty much have everything

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:51.409 
a radiator I pretty much have everything
else<00:05:48.360> maybe<00:05:49.319> a<00:05:49.409> pump<00:05:49.710> if<00:05:50.069> anyone<00:05:50.340> knows<00:05:50.580> where

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:51.419 
else maybe a pump if anyone knows where

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:53.899 
else maybe a pump if anyone knows where
I<00:05:51.659> can<00:05:51.930> get<00:05:52.080> a<00:05:52.110> really<00:05:52.530> durable<00:05:52.830> or<00:05:53.400> what<00:05:53.610> kind

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:53.909 
I can get a really durable or what kind

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:56.300 
I can get a really durable or what kind
would<00:05:54.150> be<00:05:54.270> a<00:05:54.300> really<00:05:54.599> durable<00:05:54.930> pump<00:05:55.439> that<00:05:56.159> can

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
would be a really durable pump that can

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.839 
would be a really durable pump that can
deal<00:05:56.580> with<00:05:56.610> extreme<00:05:57.240> cold<00:05:58.370> just<00:05:59.370> tell<00:05:59.639> me<00:05:59.759> and

00:05:59.839 --> 00:05:59.849 
deal with extreme cold just tell me and

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:01.610 
deal with extreme cold just tell me and
it<00:05:59.939> needs<00:06:00.090> to<00:06:00.150> run<00:06:00.360> off<00:06:00.479> of<00:06:00.599> about<00:06:00.840> 12<00:06:01.199> volts

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
it needs to run off of about 12 volts

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:07.159 
it needs to run off of about 12 volts
and<00:06:03.379> so<00:06:04.379> yeah
