00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
fuel injected bike but I mean as soon as

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.719 
fuel injected bike but I mean as soon as
you<00:01:18.780> rev<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.080> up<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.440> just<00:01:19.729> instantaneously

comes on whatever you need it maybe
could<00:02:07.260> use<00:02:07.440> a<00:02:07.470> little<00:02:07.890> bit<00:02:08.010> more<00:02:08.300> on<00:02:09.300> the

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:09.540 
could use a little bit more on the

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.800 
could use a little bit more on the
over-rev<00:02:09.930> but<00:02:10.650> it's<00:02:11.250> got<00:02:11.810> monstered

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
over-rev but it's got monstered

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.160 
over-rev but it's got monstered
mid-range<00:02:13.790> for<00:02:14.790> how<00:02:14.850> smooth<00:02:15.180> it<00:02:15.330> is<00:02:15.360> plenty<00:02:16.140> of

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
mid-range for how smooth it is plenty of

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.330 
mid-range for how smooth it is plenty of
torque<00:02:16.500> for<00:02:16.910> how<00:02:17.910> hard<00:02:18.180> it<00:02:18.270> hits<00:02:19.340> more

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
torque for how hard it hits more

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.310 
torque for how hard it hits more
accurate<00:02:20.880> than<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.120> bike<00:02:21.270> turn<00:02:21.540> in<00:02:21.660> its<00:02:21.900> you

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
accurate than the bike turn in its you

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.480 
accurate than the bike turn in its you
really<00:02:22.620> know<00:02:22.740> where<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:22.950> front<00:02:23.100> end<00:02:23.310> it<00:02:23.400> is

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
really know where the front end it is

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.880 
really know where the front end it is
you<00:02:23.790> can<00:02:23.940> change<00:02:24.510> direction<00:02:24.750> real<00:02:25.080> nice<00:02:25.260> but

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
you can change direction real nice but

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.380 
you can change direction real nice but
the<00:02:26.010> biggest<00:02:26.220> thing<00:02:26.460> about<00:02:26.550> that<00:02:26.850> thing<00:02:27.060> when

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
the biggest thing about that thing when

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.550 
the biggest thing about that thing when
you're<00:02:27.540> in<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.780> air<00:02:28.130> or<00:02:29.130> just<00:02:29.850> in<00:02:30.390> between

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
you're in the air or just in between

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.440 
you're in the air or just in between
changing<00:02:31.560> lines<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:32.340> thing<00:02:32.580> is<00:02:32.730> real<00:02:32.940> neutral

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
changing lines the thing is real neutral

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.600 
changing lines the thing is real neutral
you're<00:02:34.320> able<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.530> select<00:02:34.740> it<00:02:35.010> limelight<00:02:35.430> huge

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
you're able to select it limelight huge

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:36.860 
you're able to select it limelight huge
then<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:35.850> have<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.030> bike<00:02:36.180> so<00:02:36.390> far<00:02:36.420> it<00:02:36.720> gives

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
then you have the bike so far it gives

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.420 
then you have the bike so far it gives
like<00:02:37.020> a<00:02:37.050> really<00:02:37.440> good<00:02:37.590> feedback<00:02:37.860> to<00:02:38.280> where

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
like a really good feedback to where

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.760 
like a really good feedback to where
you're<00:02:38.940> up<00:02:38.970> you<00:02:39.390> want<00:02:39.570> to<00:02:39.660> move<00:02:39.750> over<00:02:40.200> and<00:02:40.560> that

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
you're up you want to move over and that

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.610 
you're up you want to move over and that
thing<00:02:40.950> knows<00:02:41.190> where<00:02:41.460> it's<00:02:41.580> at<00:02:41.760> and<00:02:42.320> that<00:02:43.320> was<00:02:43.590> a

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
thing knows where it's at and that was a

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.910 
thing knows where it's at and that was a
lot<00:02:43.860> of<00:02:44.010> confidence<00:02:44.400> on<00:02:44.670> on<00:02:45.030> that<00:02:45.240> bike

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.550 

overall<00:02:50.920> it<00:02:51.130> was<00:02:51.250> a<00:02:51.280> great<00:02:51.550> machine<00:02:52.290> it's<00:02:53.290> it's

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
overall it was a great machine it's it's

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.830 
overall it was a great machine it's it's
a<00:02:53.650> little<00:02:53.770> lower<00:02:54.040> in<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:54.250> front<00:02:54.430> end<00:02:54.760> it<00:02:55.420> the

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
a little lower in the front end it the

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.180 
a little lower in the front end it the
cornering<00:02:56.230> stability<00:02:56.350> I<00:02:56.740> haven't<00:02:57.070> felt

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
cornering stability I haven't felt

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.920 
cornering stability I haven't felt
anything<00:02:57.280> like<00:02:57.670> this<00:02:57.850> is<00:02:58.060> it<00:02:58.300> this<00:02:58.480> is<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:58.690> new

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
anything like this is it this is the new

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.920 
anything like this is it this is the new
age<00:02:59.140> I<00:02:59.320> think<00:02:59.620> but<00:03:00.220> it's<00:03:01.180> really<00:03:01.480> good<00:03:01.720> the

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
age I think but it's really good the

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.510 
age I think but it's really good the
power<00:03:02.170> if<00:03:02.440> you<00:03:02.470> have<00:03:02.890> you<00:03:03.010> run<00:03:03.190> the<00:03:03.220> power

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
power if you have you run the power

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.970 
power if you have you run the power
right<00:03:03.850> it's<00:03:04.510> fine<00:03:04.900> one<00:03:05.110> of<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:05.290> fastest<00:03:05.770> bikes

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
right it's fine one of the fastest bikes

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.449 
right it's fine one of the fastest bikes
I<00:03:06.130> think<00:03:06.370> that's<00:03:06.520> out<00:03:06.700> there<00:03:06.910> and<00:03:08.310> suspicion<00:03:09.310> I

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
I think that's out there and suspicion I

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.220 
I think that's out there and suspicion I
couldn't<00:03:09.760> say<00:03:09.940> anything<00:03:09.970> bad<00:03:10.540> about<00:03:10.720> it<00:03:10.870> just

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
couldn't say anything bad about it just

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.350 
couldn't say anything bad about it just

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
so clutch is factly going into the

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.120 
so clutch is factly going into the

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
corners it doesn't dive and push out

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.080
