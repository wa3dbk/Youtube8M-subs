00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.220
 5 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.859
 hello second element engineering science 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:26.730
 we call maturity lucas 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.610
 we present to you a production of our tp having for subject of 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.360
 image acquisition 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.090
 can we capture an image 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.090
 we will study the operation of the ccd sensor 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.550
 it must be said that the ccd sensor replaces the photo film 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.170
 it is found in camera cameras and scanners 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.450
 to understand his role observing the passage of the cloud through a 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.000
 goal 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.460
 here is the sensor 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.820
 the ccd sensor was invented in 1962 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.150
 it's a sense photo component 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.590
 it requires small silicon cuvettes arranged in columns 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.030
 each letter is called a pixel 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.840
 this one consists of four music photos that allow electrons 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.840
 when they are hit by the ECB 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.520
 this signal retransmitted columns by cologne then transposed online 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.270
 he then goes to an analog-to-digital converter 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.920
 this one will know the analog signal in information which 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.410
 will be a digital image 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.250
 the color is held by a bayern filter 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.370
 composed of three colors 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.420
 this filter has twice more 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.390
 verplank gaymard is much more sensitive 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.990
 each photosite receives then only according to gordon of correspondents none 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.000
 three accounts 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.720
 the electric intensity proportional to the luminous intensity is then 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.690
 claude ford 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.740
 in Guinean nation 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.740
 the sharpness of an image proportionally 

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:13.379
 a minimum of 20 million pixels for 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:14.489
 and 300 minutes 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:15.769
 a video image 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.749
 the rest by serving to stabilize the image 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:20.869
 we also talk about resolution 

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:24.949
 that's the number of dots the pixel per inch an inch and was trying to gala the 

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:29.849
 guild 54 centimeters is yield here lies device at 38 years
