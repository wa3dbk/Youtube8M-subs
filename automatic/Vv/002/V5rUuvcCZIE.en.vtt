00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.140
 Orrei of friends Fabietti good morning to 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.500
 all 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.699
 company of sony vaio 2 11 display from 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.680
 11 inches 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.090
 we immediately see the keyboard 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.070
 backlit 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.619
 it is an ultrabook to all 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.660
 effects in the sense that we have a 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.510
 the possibility of having a touch display 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.239
 15-inch in high definition a lot 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.650
 convenient with windows 8 operating system 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.110
 hence all the classic applications 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.750
 lindows oct things indented maps e 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.449
 anything else front camera e 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.010
 camera also back and when then 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:50.600
 we need a physical keyboard more 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.370
 all we have to do is drag 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.140
 incorrect tabs 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.320
 positive becomes a real 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.030
 unfortunately we have the keys as a keyboard 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.769
 with slightly more island keys 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.230
 small compared to those of another 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.460
 classic mouse pointer with i 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.710
 buttons to better manage 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.299
 windows 8 interface 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.550
 inter part of one emphasizes 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.860
 easily recalled in this way 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.390
 then we have this Apennines a curtain 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.310
 sold directly in the package 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.500
 of the device that allows us to 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.300
 interact better with the system 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.820
 operational and with all applications 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.740
 which is sonia pre-installed on the device 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.740
 we said windows 8 full version 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.539
 so not that r the device then 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.320
 has a last intel processor 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:35.509
 i3 generation i5 author the 7 4 gb of 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.530
 ram memory and hard disk ranging from 128 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:41.240
 256 gb ssd therefore very fast 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.200
 in terms of connectivity we have everything 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.080
 what we have that we have 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.420
 need and input vga card reader 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.420
 of memory between and half agreements 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:54.320
 then on the other side we have two doors 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.270
 usb and hdmi connection from the array 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.310
 see attached to the display by a 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.470
 very durable mechanism enough 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.229
 I confess but really very solid and 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.119
 robust that does not move in any 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.789
 so the display when we ask for it 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.770
 the thickness is one inch 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:12.800
 we are practically confused with the 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.360
 our hand in hand the device that 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.340
 it is not even too heavy 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.739
 certainly comparable as we said a 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.300
 all respects to a classic which a 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.970
 device that will arrive soon on 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.500
 trade also in Italy 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.989
 really very interesting because 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.480
 allows you to have the convenience of a 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.610
 tablet with touchscreen display and so 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.739
 fast intuitive interface of 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.420
 windows windows phone 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.000
 if we want windows 8 anyway 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.000
 these are the tiles of windows 8 and then 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.890
 allows us to have the same time 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.510
 all the classic features of 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.489
 windows of three classic versions 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.100
 become really very interesting that 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:51.799
 I'm curious to try it in a way 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:55.989
 more in-depth calmly in the future a 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.989
 Greetings to all from riccardo biolife fir
