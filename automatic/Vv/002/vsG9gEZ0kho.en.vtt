to rien with bonus combo minus one gems

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.709 
to rien with bonus combo minus one gems
and<00:00:48.289> that's<00:00:48.679> meant<00:00:48.980> I<00:00:49.129> could<00:00:49.399> get<00:00:49.640> a<00:00:49.879> bonus

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
combo every hit and I also use Titan

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.430 
combo every hit and I also use Titan
break<00:00:54.440> potions<00:00:55.159> and<00:00:55.969> that<00:00:56.210> meant<00:00:56.480> my<00:00:56.809> attack

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
break potions and that meant my attack

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.860 
break potions and that meant my attack
window<00:00:57.949> lasted<00:00:58.550> the<00:00:58.670> whole<00:00:58.699> fight<00:00:59.239> and<00:00:59.659> I'll

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
window lasted the whole fight and I'll

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.889 
window lasted the whole fight and I'll
show<00:01:00.170> you<00:01:00.199> it<00:01:00.499> here<00:01:00.769> in<00:01:00.980> action<00:01:01.489> so<00:01:02.149> the<00:01:02.449> Titan

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
show you it here in action so the Titan

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.880 
show you it here in action so the Titan
is<00:01:03.460> level<00:01:04.460> 1000<00:01:05.239> and<00:01:05.480> it's<00:01:06.200> a<00:01:06.380> two<00:01:06.650> minute

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
is level 1000 and it's a two minute

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.610 
is level 1000 and it's a two minute
round<00:01:07.280> against<00:01:07.909> him<00:01:08.120> and<00:01:08.300> he<00:01:08.560> doesn't<00:01:09.560> have

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:09.620 
round against him and he doesn't have

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.730 
round against him and he doesn't have
any<00:01:10.100> spectrum<00:01:10.820> defense<00:01:11.300> so<00:01:12.080> you<00:01:12.170> don't<00:01:12.530> need

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
any spectrum defense so you don't need

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.400 
any spectrum defense so you don't need
to<00:01:12.800> use<00:01:13.100> nullify<00:01:13.760> magic<00:01:14.270> and<00:01:14.540> any<00:01:14.870> of<00:01:15.140> your

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 
to use nullify magic and any of your

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.340 
to use nullify magic and any of your
element<00:01:15.980> attack<00:01:16.100> gems<00:01:16.670> will<00:01:16.970> work<00:01:17.240> so<00:01:18.140> that's

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
element attack gems will work so that's

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.730 
element attack gems will work so that's
why<00:01:18.680> I<00:01:18.710> stacked<00:01:19.190> up<00:01:19.490> with<00:01:19.730> all<00:01:20.000> of<00:01:20.030> mine<00:01:20.450> and<00:01:20.810> I

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
why I stacked up with all of mine and I

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.850 
why I stacked up with all of mine and I
dodged<00:01:22.220> the<00:01:22.820> last<00:01:23.270> hit<00:01:23.690> for<00:01:24.020> the<00:01:24.470> longest

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
dodged the last hit for the longest

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.730 
dodged the last hit for the longest
attack<00:01:25.400> window<00:01:25.880> because<00:01:26.750> dodge<00:01:27.050> breaks<00:01:27.440> are

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
attack window because dodge breaks are

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.050 
attack window because dodge breaks are
longer<00:01:28.040> than<00:01:28.220> power

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
longer than power

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.889 
longer than power
and<00:01:29.570> then<00:01:30.500> basically<00:01:31.040> i<00:01:31.430> performed<00:01:32.299> bonus

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
and then basically i performed bonus

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:35.649 
and then basically i performed bonus
combos<00:01:33.409> over<00:01:33.710> yet<00:01:34.159> for<00:01:34.880> the<00:01:35.000> rest<00:01:35.240> of<00:01:35.479> the

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659

stage<00:01:35.960> and<00:01:36.409> that<00:01:37.100> was<00:01:37.340> because<00:01:37.549> of<00:01:37.789> the<00:01:38.060> tiny

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
stage and that was because of the tiny

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.289 
stage and that was because of the tiny
break<00:01:38.689> potions<00:01:39.289> and<00:01:39.560> you<00:01:40.430> can<00:01:40.610> make<00:01:40.789> them<00:01:41.060> with
