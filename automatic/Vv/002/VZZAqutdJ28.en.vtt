crossbow<00:01:36.630> just<00:01:37.110> in<00:01:37.290> crossbow<00:01:37.770> where<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.759> can

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
crossbow just in crossbow where you can

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.490 
crossbow just in crossbow where you can
light<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.090> up<00:01:39.329> like<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.689> get<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:39.990> lighter<00:01:40.229> and

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
light it up like you get a lighter and

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.499 
light it up like you get a lighter and
just<00:01:40.950> like<00:01:41.070> an<00:01:41.159> animation<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:42.030> light<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.240> up

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
just like an animation you light it up

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.539 
just like an animation you light it up
and<00:01:43.049> then<00:01:43.140> when<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.320> fire<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.590> just<00:01:44.040> explodes

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
and then when you fire it just explodes

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.210 
and then when you fire it just explodes
like<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.299> grenade<00:01:45.540> or<00:01:45.960> like<00:01:46.439> 10<00:01:46.649> times<00:01:46.950> stronger

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
like a grenade or like 10 times stronger

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.990 
like a grenade or like 10 times stronger
and<00:01:48.259> I<00:01:49.259> think<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.009> crossbow<00:01:50.460> should<00:01:50.820> be

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
and I think the crossbow should be

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.710 
and I think the crossbow should be
primary<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:52.200> can<00:01:52.350> be<00:01:52.470> like<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.649> sniper<00:01:52.950> i<00:01:53.540> mean<00:01:54.540> i

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
primary it can be like a sniper i mean i

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.660 
primary it can be like a sniper i mean i
don't<00:01:54.899> i<00:01:55.110> don't<00:01:55.350> know<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.799> damage<00:01:56.100> how<00:01:56.490> will

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
don't i don't know the damage how will

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.120 
don't i don't know the damage how will
we<00:01:56.700> be<00:01:56.759> but<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:58.140> guy<00:01:58.259> figured<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.740> out<00:01:58.770> with

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
we be but the guy figured that out with

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.039 
we be but the guy figured that out with
the<00:01:59.219> crossbow<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.909> think<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.600> crossbow<00:02:00.899> should

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
the crossbow I think the crossbow should

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.469 
the crossbow I think the crossbow should
be<00:02:01.110> primary<00:02:01.500> if<00:02:02.070> it's<00:02:02.219> if<00:02:02.670> it's<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:03.030> secondary

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
be primary if it's if it's a secondary

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.600 
be primary if it's if it's a secondary
as<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.049> side<00:02:04.350> on<00:02:04.500> like<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.680> pistol<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.310> won't<00:02:05.490> be

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
as a side on like a pistol it won't be

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.850 
as a side on like a pistol it won't be
used<00:02:05.909> as<00:02:06.030> much<00:02:06.240> i<00:02:06.540> really<00:02:07.469> don't<00:02:07.619> know<00:02:07.649> people

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
used as much i really don't know people

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.830

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
use it that much it's a sidearm it's the

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.229 
use it that much it's a sidearm it's the

used to its full potential that'd be
really<00:03:06.010> great<00:03:06.129> it's<00:03:06.849> a<00:03:07.060> new<00:03:07.239> scavenger<00:03:07.780> in

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
really great it's a new scavenger in

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.179 
really great it's a new scavenger in

only<00:03:11.829> with<00:03:12.129> a<00:03:12.220> pistol<00:03:12.549> must<00:03:12.760> search<00:03:12.970> the

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
only with a pistol must search the

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.089 
only with a pistol must search the
environment<00:03:13.780> to<00:03:14.200> find<00:03:14.439> more<00:03:14.709> powerful

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
environment to find more powerful

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:16.589 
environment to find more powerful
weapons<00:03:15.430> and<00:03:15.579> increasing<00:03:16.180> their<00:03:16.299> chance<00:03:16.540> for

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
weapons and increasing their chance for

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:18.869 
weapons and increasing their chance for
survival<00:03:16.870> so<00:03:17.739> you<00:03:17.829> start<00:03:18.069> with<00:03:18.099> the<00:03:18.250> pistol<00:03:18.430> a

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879 
survival so you start with the pistol a

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.240 
survival so you start with the pistol a
knife<00:03:19.329> and<00:03:19.840> I<00:03:20.260> think<00:03:20.470> there's<00:03:20.859> gonna<00:03:20.979> be<00:03:21.099> a<00:03:21.129> new

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
knife and I think there's gonna be a new

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.729 
knife and I think there's gonna be a new
knife<00:03:21.459> also<00:03:21.849> a<00:03:22.329> machete<00:03:22.989> will<00:03:23.199> probably<00:03:23.470> new

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
knife also a machete will probably new

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.849 
knife also a machete will probably new
knife<00:03:23.919> so<00:03:24.729> that<00:03:24.760> really<00:03:25.060> pretty<00:03:25.269> cool<00:03:25.569> man<00:03:26.109> let

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859
