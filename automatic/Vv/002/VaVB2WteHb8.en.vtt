I'm hanging on like a slurve this is
more<00:00:21.720> pace<00:00:21.990> but<00:00:22.350> I'm<00:00:22.470> losing<00:00:22.710> control<00:00:22.950> of<00:00:22.980> the

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
more pace but I'm losing control of the

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.670 
more pace but I'm losing control of the
ball<00:00:23.280> it<00:00:23.940> tends<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.300> go<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.630> forehand<00:00:24.990> but

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
ball it tends to go to the forehand but

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.710 
ball it tends to go to the forehand but
note<00:00:25.920> how<00:00:26.130> far<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.550> I<00:00:26.610> get<00:00:26.820> by<00:00:27.180> propelling

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
note how far and I get by propelling

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.240 
note how far and I get by propelling
myself<00:00:27.900> into<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.470> court<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:28.950> get<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.160> little

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
myself into the court I get a little

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.550 
myself into the court I get a little
more<00:00:29.400> action<00:00:29.700> on<00:00:30.120> the<00:00:30.330> ball<00:00:30.540> but<00:00:31.290> end<00:00:31.440> up

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
more action on the ball but end up

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
really far in scientific retreat before

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.940
