00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.730

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:11.150
 the enjoy the whole environment that 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.250
 one that everyday 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.650
 Surprises the choice in nature 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.960
 experienced if that is now in the summer or 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.940

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.930

 Ready for wind and nature 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.900
 and it is lived need and culture 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.170
 under the early morning when the morning sun 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.310
 Here I am with my two dogs 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.930

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:53.030
 enjoy the first birds chirping 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.030
 Listen and do something for me 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.409
 I could not hunt without a dog 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.409
 imagine 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.330
 I have the intensive form of the 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.120
 nature experience but it belongs to me 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:18.080
 Also add that as a hunter today 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:21.430
 I do animals as animals from the 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.430
 found naturally 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.019
 as in this regional product and that 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.069
 exciting product and that's why 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.069
 fascinated with her action 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.739
 Hunting is also nature conservation it is often 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.900
 doubted but it is relevant in 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.959
 what our cultural landscapes 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.700

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.519
 on the other side those species of animals too 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.349
 regulate 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.420
 to vote on the habitat is it 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:12.340
 the predatory or be it also deer 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:16.180

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.180
