musician of a few years now and today

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.060 
musician of a few years now and today
i'm<00:00:10.290> going<00:00:10.380> to<00:00:10.440> show<00:00:10.590> you<00:00:10.620> how<00:00:10.740> to<00:00:10.860> use<00:00:11.040> a

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
i'm going to show you how to use a

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.910 
i'm going to show you how to use a
low-pass<00:00:11.700> filter<00:00:12.269> on<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:12.570> bass<00:00:13.019> guitar<00:00:13.049> so

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
low-pass filter on a bass guitar so

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.029 
low-pass filter on a bass guitar so
let's<00:00:14.460> get<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:14.639> it<00:00:15.529> alright<00:00:16.529> so<00:00:16.740> let's<00:00:16.890> go

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
let's get to it alright so let's go

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.310 
let's get to it alright so let's go
ahead<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.279> use<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.820> low-pass<00:00:18.539> filter<00:00:19.080> on<00:00:19.289> a

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
ahead and use a low-pass filter on a

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.130 
ahead and use a low-pass filter on a
bass<00:00:19.680> guitar<00:00:19.939> now<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:20.970> low-pass<00:00:21.570> filter<00:00:21.990> is

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
bass guitar now a low-pass filter is

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.250 
bass guitar now a low-pass filter is
basically<00:00:22.710> an<00:00:22.920> eq<00:00:23.550> that<00:00:24.119> allows<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.869> lower

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
basically an eq that allows the lower

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.290 
basically an eq that allows the lower
frequencies<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.160> come<00:00:26.369> through<00:00:26.670> while

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
frequencies to come through while

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.410 
frequencies to come through while
attenuating<00:00:28.260> or<00:00:28.500> cutting<00:00:29.279> off<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:30.029> higher

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
attenuating or cutting off the higher

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.810 
attenuating or cutting off the higher
frequencies<00:00:31.199> so<00:00:32.070> let's<00:00:32.250> go<00:00:32.369> ahead<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.579> add

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
frequencies so let's go ahead and add

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.120 
frequencies so let's go ahead and add
that<00:00:33.059> in<00:00:33.270> but<00:00:33.960> well<00:00:34.320> you<00:00:34.530> know<00:00:34.559> what<00:00:34.739> actually

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
that in but well you know what actually

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.979 
that in but well you know what actually
before<00:00:35.280> we<00:00:35.730> add<00:00:35.910> that<00:00:36.120> end<00:00:36.300> let's<00:00:36.540> go<00:00:36.660> ahead

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
before we add that end let's go ahead

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.229 
before we add that end let's go ahead
and<00:00:37.230> take<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.500> quick<00:00:37.829> listen<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.969> space

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
and take a quick listen to the space

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.479 
and take a quick listen to the space
track<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.899> so<00:00:40.800> we<00:00:40.890> can<00:00:41.010> get<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.160> little<00:00:41.309> bit

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
track and so we can get a little bit

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:53.689 
track and so we can get a little bit
familiar<00:00:41.670> with<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:52.219> okay<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.460> should

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
familiar with it okay and that should

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.490 
familiar with it okay and that should
give<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.000> good<00:00:54.059> idea<00:00:54.239> now<00:00:55.140> let's<00:00:55.320> go<00:00:55.440> ahead

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
give you a good idea now let's go ahead

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.560 
give you a good idea now let's go ahead
and<00:00:55.590> switch<00:00:55.860> over<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.520> mix<00:00:56.760> window<00:00:56.969> here

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
and switch over to the mix window here

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.970 
and switch over to the mix window here
and<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:58.530> quick<00:00:59.070> FYI<00:00:59.280> I<00:01:00.379> you<00:01:01.379> can<00:01:01.530> basically<00:01:01.710> use

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
and a quick FYI I you can basically use

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.910 
and a quick FYI I you can basically use
any<00:01:02.670> digital<00:01:03.660> audio<00:01:03.930> workstation<00:01:04.589> doesn't

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
any digital audio workstation doesn't

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.440 
any digital audio workstation doesn't
matter<00:01:05.040> what<00:01:05.250> program<00:01:05.640> you're<00:01:05.790> using<00:01:05.850> as<00:01:06.270> long

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
matter what program you're using as long

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
matter what program you're using as long
as<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.840> has<00:01:07.409> an<00:01:07.770> EQ<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.549> as<00:01:09.420> long<00:01:09.630> as<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:09.990> eq

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
as it has an EQ and as long as that eq

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.950 
as it has an EQ and as long as that eq
has<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.979> low<00:01:11.580> pass<00:01:11.790> filter<00:01:12.210> on<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.330> alright

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
has a low pass filter on it alright

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.590 
has a low pass filter on it alright
alright<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:13.710> let's<00:01:13.890> jump<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.520> I'm<00:01:14.760> going<00:01:15.479> to

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
plugins and go to eq and I'm just going

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.330 
plugins and go to eq and I'm just going
to<00:01:23.340> use<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:24.000> r<00:01:24.420> eq<00:01:25.350> which<00:01:25.560> is<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.830> renaissance

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
to use the r eq which is the renaissance

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.020 
to use the r eq which is the renaissance
eq<00:01:27.020> alright<00:01:28.020> know<00:01:28.229> whichever<00:01:28.979> eq<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.909> are

using go ahead and locate the the

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.310 
using go ahead and locate the the
low-pass<00:01:33.210> filter<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.689> this<00:01:33.780> usually<00:01:33.990> on<00:01:34.229> the

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
low-pass filter and this usually on the

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.969 
low-pass filter and this usually on the
right<00:01:34.530> hand<00:01:34.740> side<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.610> renaissance<00:01:36.770> has<00:01:37.770> it

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
right hand side the renaissance has it

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.120 
right hand side the renaissance has it
in<00:01:38.070> this<00:01:38.220> drop-down<00:01:38.909> menu<00:01:39.540> right<00:01:39.720> here<00:01:40.009> but<00:01:41.009> by

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
in this drop-down menu right here but by

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.080 
in this drop-down menu right here but by
default<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:42.090> has<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.689> as<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:43.460> high<00:01:44.460> shelf<00:01:44.700> filter

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
default it has it as a high shelf filter

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.910 
default it has it as a high shelf filter
and<00:01:45.329> we<00:01:45.479> don't<00:01:45.630> want<00:01:45.750> that<00:01:46.020> so<00:01:46.530> we<00:01:46.680> want<00:01:46.860> to

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
and we don't want that so we want to

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.190 
and we don't want that so we want to
click<00:01:47.040> on<00:01:47.250> this<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.640> we<00:01:48.000> want<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.420> select<00:01:48.659> the

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
click on this and we want to select the

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.310 
click on this and we want to select the
low<00:01:49.590> pass<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.280> it's<00:01:50.850> going<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.149> be<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:51.810> icon

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
low pass and it's going to be this icon

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.870 
low pass and it's going to be this icon
so<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:53.040> icon<00:01:53.399> is<00:01:55.100> generally<00:01:56.100> on<00:01:56.280> on<00:01:56.579> most

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
so that icon is generally on on most

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.270 
so that icon is generally on on most
eq's<00:01:57.869> alright<00:01:58.619> so<00:01:58.829> let's<00:01:58.979> go<00:01:59.130> ahead<00:01:59.159> and

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
eq's alright so let's go ahead and

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.450 
eq's alright so let's go ahead and
select<00:01:59.460> that<00:01:59.729> and<00:01:59.939> now<00:02:00.659> on<00:02:00.990> this<00:02:01.710> box<00:02:02.250> right

select that and now on this box right

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.730 
select that and now on this box right
here<00:02:02.600> this<00:02:03.600> tells<00:02:03.869> us<00:02:03.990> where<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.259> frequency

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
here this tells us where the frequency

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.700 
here this tells us where the frequency
will<00:02:04.890> start<00:02:05.280> attenuating<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.090> cutting<00:02:06.479> off

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
will start attenuating and cutting off
