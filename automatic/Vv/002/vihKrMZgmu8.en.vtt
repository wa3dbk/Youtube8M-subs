00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.330 
I'll see you guys in a few alright guys
so<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.509> actually<00:01:21.720> didn't<00:01:22.080> have<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.290> search<00:01:22.530> far

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
so I actually didn't have to search far

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.830 
so I actually didn't have to search far
at<00:01:23.520> all<00:01:23.549> this<00:01:23.880> was<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.240> first<00:01:24.450> one<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.780> I

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
at all this was the first one that I

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.870 
at all this was the first one that I
searched<00:01:25.380> for<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.250> know<00:01:26.369> honestly<00:01:26.610> I

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
searched for and you know honestly I

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.450 
searched for and you know honestly I
think<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.299> we<00:01:27.390> might<00:01:27.509> can<00:01:27.750> take<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.500> we

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
think that we might can take this so we

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.999 
think that we might can take this so we
are<00:01:29.579> going<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:30.150> hopefully<00:01:30.990> our<00:01:31.350> heroes<00:01:31.829> will

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
are going to hopefully our heroes will

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.859 
are going to hopefully our heroes will

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.890 
still doing a good job of staying up and
it<00:02:50.980> would<00:02:51.130> be<00:02:51.250> absolutely<00:02:51.610> ridiculous<00:02:52.420> if<00:02:52.660> we

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
it would be absolutely ridiculous if we

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.319 
it would be absolutely ridiculous if we
got<00:02:53.110> fifty<00:02:53.829> percent<00:02:54.130> on<00:02:54.280> this<00:02:54.430> I<00:02:54.579> think<00:02:54.640> that

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
got fifty percent on this I think that

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:57.240 
got fifty percent on this I think that
will<00:02:56.019> run<00:02:56.200> out<00:02:56.230> of<00:02:56.349> time<00:02:56.560> before<00:02:56.799> we're<00:02:57.099> able

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
will run out of time before we're able

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.160 
will run out of time before we're able
to<00:02:57.400> do<00:02:57.549> that<00:02:57.700> but<00:02:58.450> as<00:02:58.599> you<00:02:58.750> can<00:02:58.810> see<00:02:58.989> the

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
to do that but as you can see the

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.080 
to do that but as you can see the
healers<00:02:59.530> are<00:02:59.680> still<00:03:00.010> out<00:03:00.190> of<00:03:00.340> range<00:03:00.519> of<00:03:00.879> all

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090

pretty much at full health which is

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:08.610 
pretty much at full health which is
ridiculous<00:03:05.620> that<00:03:06.099> she's<00:03:06.430> doing<00:03:06.610> that<00:03:07.620> so

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620
