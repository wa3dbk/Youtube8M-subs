 I will make a video response to the video the 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.510
 wolf is that he said in quotes the 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.120
 true reason for the withdrawal of the wak and 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.670
 I clarify that the video will be a video 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.410
 normal response nothing great and 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.960
 another thing is that I will also say things 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.060
 obvious but good and apart the video does not 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.130
 it's just for quiet wolves but that 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.260
 also to his fans who believed that 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.260
 video without more filling let's start 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.930
 Hello, good morning, evenings or evenings

 joaquin what really I also want 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.550

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.350
 do not lie by saying that they looted it what 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.360
 that something bad happened to him I've seen the 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.430
 trolls who dedicated criticism to him 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.500
 insulted in their channel and hate them only 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.420
 to see my little pony good I saw 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.519
 as they uploaded videos glad that 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.710
 have closed your channel first so that 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.869
 know the cat I do not look at any of those 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.700
 videos, so he did not give them the 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.460
 satisfaction to those poop trolls 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.580
 first users who hate ilhwa 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.190
 kilo do not hate them because I saw ml pe but 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.470
 that they hate you for how beautiful it is 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.899
 say they hate them because in the video 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.360
 plagiarism to pop it proved to be very fan 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:29.179

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.759
 video of tackles and kender value second 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:33.740
 the cat hurts you or not he saw those videos 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.929
 for example in the can videos or 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.119
 sadistic and the desired was auditors he the 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:40.940
 saw and even answered them with a 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.459
 evasive that was scratched disk so you 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.560
 argument goes to hell I talked to 

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:46.640
 he and joaquin what personally then 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.310
 that will close your channel 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.110
 he said what were his reasons good 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.120
 first before they say that actually 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.920
 I did not talk about it joaquin what after 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.320
 that closing his channel and I'm just 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.020
 inventing things because first I want that 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.409
 listen to this and as well as hobby it 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.409
 sick 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:09.119
 I preferred to close it 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.370
 before continuing to feed the mouth of 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.290
 crazy capitalists like those who are 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.240
 the bosses of youtube good with this 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.760
 they will know that actually if I talked to the 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.770
 uac and the good friends I recorded all the 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.480
 conversation I had on skype with thread 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.670
 wah kilos after I 'll close your 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.860
 channel but I will not show it for questions 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.870
 of respect but I will only upload this video 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.330
 because I want you to know the truth well 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.760
 because the joaquin lock allowed me to 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.530
 see if you recorded the whole conversation with 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.560
 he joaqui love why the fuck does not 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.510
 bone samples if we want to believe you 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.550
 you actually spoke with ilhwa kilo 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.250
 why do not you show us the conversation 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.860
 whole then you're hiding something from us 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.780
 really good first I want you to know 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.760
 that the joaquin lock left because he was 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.920
 bored with youtube he was already going to 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.140
 check out much earlier but decided 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.790
 stay a little more good he did not have 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.400
 problems in school or in your life 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.620
 the opposite happened to me he said that he 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.840
 I could handle school well and I had 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.090
 the same time it was doing very well 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.120
 his retirement was only because of boredom 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.370
 more ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha me 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.900
 this argument really laughs 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.629
 serious and joaqui log went to bore 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.629
 yes clear and mario is copy of gta san 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:21.400
 andreas hahahaha if I here what is 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:23.769
 It was out of boredom, why the fuck? 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.659
 he spoke as if he were crying not 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.870
 there is contradiction and that is very 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:30.849
 easy to notice so the assholes that 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.739
 they say he left because of the criticisms 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:34.540
 they did it or because they looted it 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.939
 They can fuck is not as it was by 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.409
 those reasons hahaha so those trolls 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:40.239
 of shit will not keep the 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:43.120
 satisfaction that he went for those 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:45.159
 good reasons on your facebook then I 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.019
 He said he would never use it again or he could 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:49.269
 that closes it seriously not if yes in 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:51.250
 reality will do that but hopefully not what 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.200
 do to keep it communicating 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.540
 with those who really wanted it and not 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.489
 for interest like the flip chapel and the 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.349
 which I see is not very sad after 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.939
 of the departure of the wak and what for 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:03.040
 I really want you to know something very 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:04.959
 important all the friends of fennel 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.909
 here the good thing I want you to know that the 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:09.069
 joaquin considers cupid flip and 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:11.109
 as a traitor since I told you there what 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:13.510
 joaquin or that entered the channel of dram 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:15.700
 flip and so you see something interesting and 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.799
 joaquin saw how happy she was 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.690
 then to lock his channel to the cat 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.950
 spanair or did not like that since it 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.050
 considers as betrayal 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.580
 besides that the calc upyd flip and said 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.440
 tree and joaqui what he said that 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.060
 kept secret and that was his 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.010
 first show of betrayal 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.500
 I return to my opinion that girl was only 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.270
 iwaki love friend for interest was only 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.910
 joaquÃ­n her friend for what he pleases 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.320
 fame and fanboys know that is my opinion and 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.030
 I will never change it 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.370
 good and joaquin told me that also 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.470
 it was because there were those treacherous people 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.420
 fucking scum they just wanted the 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.420
 friendship of him joaquin love for interest and 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:51.490
 nothing else about Cupid and 600 flip and those 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:53.710
 traitorous people I imagine that 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.900
 they said that to be good with those who 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.730
 he was criticized for example of the request q 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:01.180
 He said it to look good with cast 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:03.070
 a final red wine pegasus among others 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.930
 but that is already his decision the 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.790
 purpose of your retirement is not to give 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.100
 too bad to be asked 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.680
 come back as I said he just got bored and 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.720
 good point that's all I think 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.700
 say about his retirement and joaquin what 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.920
 He told me something else before leaving that 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:20.110
 sure many of your friends will forget 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.060
 from him I think that will depend on 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.740
 who were his true friends and 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.960
 who was not good too 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.370
 I want to say something more to the friends of 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.350
 iwaki the good 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.270
 is that they do not subscribe to my channel because 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.130
 this video I only did for those who do not 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.080
 they know nothing about your retirement from youtube and 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:37.180
 also so that they know that he is well 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.949
 and that they do not feel bad about their retirement on 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.570
 sure he wants to be remembered for the 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:42.850
 happiness and the support he gave them 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.680
 many the cauldrons good friends before 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.750
 to leave I want you to listen to a few 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.639
 words which I joaquin said 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.500
 in the conversation I had with him and 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:52.180
 also that at the end of the video he 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.460
 allowed the last question to go up 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:57.520
 of the week good bye and be happy 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:59.650
 See you soon I'll tell you and I'll give it back to you 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.539
 repeat if he joaqui what went by 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:04.300
 boredom why the fuck did he get 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:06.580
 cry as if it were something serious if I 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:09.220
 out of this page out of boredom 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.560
 least I would take it normal and another 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.690
 pretty interesting question of all 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.060
 the friends of iwaki love because he told you 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:17.979
 that only you smell me that wall fish 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.810
 can be the same in joaquin or in 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:22.840
 another account or even just one 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:24.710
 false conversation I do not know but only 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.290
 those are theories 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.690
 Another thing I forget to add is that the 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:31.190
 user vigilantes 15 mentioned that he 

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.860
 joaqui what was left because he no longer 

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:36.210
 I supported criticism more and that 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:39.900
 I think they were very good friends 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:42.000
 well I say goodbye to my 110 and 70 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:46.639
 tests and my little friends from my little box 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.639
 recommended a greeting and even another
