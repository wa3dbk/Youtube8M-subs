gonna pop on the lid and when the stock
has<00:01:25.650> evaporated<00:01:27.020> start<00:01:28.020> adding<00:01:28.259> all<00:01:28.409> stop<00:01:28.740> so

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
has evaporated start adding all stop so

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.069 
has evaporated start adding all stop so
you<00:01:29.579> can<00:01:29.909> see<00:01:30.119> it's<00:01:30.329> starting<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.659> evaporate

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
you can see it's starting to evaporate

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.469 
you can see it's starting to evaporate

this<00:01:49.290> game<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.890> got

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
this game I got

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:57.010 
this game I got
skin<00:01:51.470> on<00:01:55.030> so<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.119> way<00:01:56.240> I<00:01:56.270> usually<00:01:56.659> get<00:01:56.960> the

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
skin on so the way I usually get the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:03.190 
skin on so the way I usually get the
skin<00:01:57.320> off<00:01:58.420> is<00:02:01.360> basically<00:02:02.360> start<00:02:02.869> from<00:02:02.930> this

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
skin off is basically start from this

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.070 
skin off is basically start from this
end<00:02:03.439> the<00:02:03.920> fatter<00:02:04.250> end<00:02:04.399> so<00:02:05.210> the<00:02:05.659> first<00:02:05.899> thing

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
end the fatter end so the first thing

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.960 
end the fatter end so the first thing
you<00:02:06.170> need<00:02:06.320> to<00:02:06.380> do<00:02:06.619> really<00:02:06.830> is<00:02:07.130> just<00:02:07.159> start

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
you need to do really is just start

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.760

rice is nearly done it's still got a
tiny<00:03:17.459> bit<00:03:17.730> of<00:03:17.790> a<00:03:17.879> bite<00:03:17.909> to<00:03:18.330> it<00:03:18.390> but<00:03:18.629> before<00:03:18.750> it's

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
tiny bit of a bite to it but before it's

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.339

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
and I'm literally gonna let that sit on

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.360 
and I'm literally gonna let that sit on
the<00:03:46.049> top<00:03:46.260> like<00:03:46.440> that<00:03:46.470> and<00:03:46.680> I'm<00:03:46.950> gonna<00:03:47.069> place

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370
