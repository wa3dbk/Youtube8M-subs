starters if Naruto is trying to become
Pirate<00:00:27.330> King<00:00:27.449> I<00:00:27.599> think<00:00:27.630> he<00:00:28.050> would<00:00:28.170> have<00:00:28.320> such

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
Pirate King I think he would have such

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.389 
Pirate King I think he would have such
an<00:00:28.890> incredibly<00:00:29.880> crazy<00:00:30.779> time<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:31.740> think<00:00:32.009> naltar

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
an incredibly crazy time I think naltar

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.709 
an incredibly crazy time I think naltar
would<00:00:32.520> have<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.669> harder<00:00:33.000> time<00:00:33.030> than<00:00:33.210> Luffy

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
would have a harder time than Luffy

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.569 
would have a harder time than Luffy
having<00:00:34.079> his<00:00:34.200> people<00:00:34.620> under<00:00:35.010> him<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.460> know

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
having his people under him you know

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.459

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
fact that Luffy has this kind of thing

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.389 
fact that Luffy has this kind of thing
about<00:00:39.540> him<00:00:39.780> where<00:00:39.989> he<00:00:40.649> will<00:00:40.829> tell<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.219> off

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
and also he's never really had that like

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.100 
and also he's never really had that like
in<00:00:50.550> him<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.969> have<00:00:51.059> people<00:00:51.390> just<00:00:51.570> immediately

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
in him to have people just immediately

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.260

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
like that so in that aspect I think he'd

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.170 
like that so in that aspect I think he'd
have<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.129> little<00:00:56.280> bit<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.640> difficult<00:00:57.030> time

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
have a little bit of a difficult time

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.180 
have a little bit of a difficult time
having<00:00:57.750> his<00:00:57.899> crew<00:00:58.199> listen<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.649> him<00:00:58.800> not<00:00:58.980> that

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
having his crew listen to him not that

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.680 
having his crew listen to him not that
Lupe's<00:00:59.670> crew<00:00:59.879> always<00:00:59.969> listen<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.390> him<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.570> lot

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
Lupe's crew always listen to him a lot

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.029 
Lupe's crew always listen to him a lot
of<00:01:00.809> times<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.109> actually<00:01:01.199> even<00:01:01.469> make<00:01:01.649> fun<00:01:01.859> and

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
of times I actually even make fun and

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.039 
of times I actually even make fun and
stuff<00:01:02.309> but<00:01:02.699> they<00:01:02.789> do<00:01:02.850> have<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.210> lot<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.570> respect

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
stuff but they do have a lot of respect

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.230 
stuff but they do have a lot of respect
and<00:01:04.170> obey<00:01:04.979> Him<00:01:05.220> Naruto's<00:01:05.670> aventure<00:01:06.090> to

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
and obey Him Naruto's aventure to

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.820 
and obey Him Naruto's aventure to
becoming<00:01:06.540> Pirate<00:01:06.930> King<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.200> think<00:01:07.470> he<00:01:07.590> would<00:01:07.710> be

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
becoming Pirate King I think he would be

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.020 
becoming Pirate King I think he would be
actually<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.220> bit<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.670> different<00:01:08.939> character

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
actually a bit of a different character

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.210 
actually a bit of a different character
as<00:01:09.330> well<00:01:09.510> because<00:01:09.840> with<00:01:10.380> all<00:01:10.590> these<00:01:10.740> knock<00:01:11.040> him

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
as well because with all these knock him

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.429 
as well because with all these knock him
around<00:01:11.310> him<00:01:11.760> constantly<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.720> would<00:01:13.110> just<00:01:13.320> be<00:01:13.409> a

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
around him constantly it would just be a

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.080 
around him constantly it would just be a
very<00:01:13.710> different<00:01:14.130> atmosphere<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:14.790> feel<00:01:15.000> as

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
very different atmosphere I feel as

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.249 
very different atmosphere I feel as
though<00:01:15.119> he<00:01:15.360> would<00:01:15.479> lose<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.689> lot<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:16.020> his<00:01:16.110> knock

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
though he would lose a lot of his knock

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.840 
though he would lose a lot of his knock
them<00:01:16.470> on<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.770> way<00:01:16.890> as<00:01:17.040> well<00:01:17.189> because<00:01:17.520> when<00:01:17.729> it

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
them on the way as well because when it

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.730 
them on the way as well because when it
comes<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.240> like<00:01:18.390> his<00:01:18.780> friends<00:01:19.229> he<00:01:19.350> never<00:01:19.530> gives

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
comes to like his friends he never gives

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.499 
comes to like his friends he never gives
up<00:01:19.890> on<00:01:20.040> them<00:01:20.220> but<00:01:20.340> think<00:01:20.549> about<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:21.000> like

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
up on them but think about it is like

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.109 
up on them but think about it is like
for<00:01:21.689> example<00:01:21.750> when<00:01:22.140> Sasuke<00:01:22.439> left<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.520> village

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
for example when Sasuke left the village

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.880 
for example when Sasuke left the village
you<00:01:24.330> know<00:01:24.360> gnarled<00:01:24.840> open<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.439> know<00:01:25.530> trying<00:01:25.860> to

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
you know gnarled open you know trying to

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:26.870 
you know gnarled open you know trying to
get<00:01:25.979> him<00:01:26.130> back<00:01:26.280> ever<00:01:26.460> since

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
get him back ever since

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.240 
get him back ever since
remember<00:01:27.119> when<00:01:27.210> OSAP<00:01:27.630> left<00:01:27.869> one<00:01:28.200> piece<00:01:28.650> Luffy

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
remember when OSAP left one piece Luffy

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.550 
remember when OSAP left one piece Luffy
basically<00:01:29.700> listening<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.750> Zorro<00:01:31.049> didn't

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
basically listening to Zorro didn't

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.530 
basically listening to Zorro didn't
really<00:01:31.890> go<00:01:32.040> after<00:01:32.220> him<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.610> OSAP<00:01:33.150> was<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.420> one

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
really go after him and OSAP was the one

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.940 
really go after him and OSAP was the one
that<00:01:33.659> was<00:01:33.810> like<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:34.350> know<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:34.470> want<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.740> fight

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
that was like you know I want to fight

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.920 
that was like you know I want to fight
you<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.280> stuff<00:01:35.490> like<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:35.880> Naruto<00:01:36.390> probably

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
you and stuff like that Naruto probably

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.450 
you and stuff like that Naruto probably
would<00:01:37.110> have<00:01:37.200> been<00:01:37.409> like<00:01:37.470> no<00:01:37.650> one<00:01:38.009> wants<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.369> to

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
would have been like no one wants you to

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.950 
would have been like no one wants you to
leave<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.210> know<00:01:39.299> had<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.600> different

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
leave and you know had a different

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.960 
leave and you know had a different
approach<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.770> opposed<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.670> way

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
approach to it and opposed to the way

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.060 
approach to it and opposed to the way
Luffy<00:01:42.360> did<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.659> so<00:01:43.049> loose<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.530> probably<00:01:43.799> would

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
Luffy did it so loose I probably would

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.440 
Luffy did it so loose I probably would
have<00:01:44.100> ended<00:01:44.250> up<00:01:44.399> bleeding<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:45.000> he<00:01:45.210> would<00:01:45.360> have

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
have ended up bleeding and he would have

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.120 
have ended up bleeding and he would have
lost<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.780> lot<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:45.960> respect<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.560> probably<00:01:46.979> even

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
lost a lot of respect and probably even

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.649 
lost a lot of respect and probably even
Zorro<00:01:47.520> would<00:01:47.729> have<00:01:47.820> left<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.119> crew<00:01:48.360> because

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
Zorro would have left the crew because

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:49.999 
Zorro would have left the crew because
of<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.259> see<00:01:49.470> in<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:49.619> aspect

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
of that so you see in that aspect

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.830 
of that so you see in that aspect
Norrell<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.549> what<00:01:50.700> happened<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.000> like<00:01:51.180> adapt

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
Norrell to what happened to like adapt

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.080 
Norrell to what happened to like adapt
to<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.140> situation<00:01:52.290> immediately<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.490> almost

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
to the situation immediately and almost

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.340 
to the situation immediately and almost
act<00:01:54.329> like<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.509> different<00:01:54.869> person<00:01:55.200> than<00:01:55.290> the

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
act like a different person than the

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.380 
act like a different person than the
gnarled<00:01:55.710> so<00:01:55.829> we<00:01:55.979> know<00:01:56.159> unfortunately<00:01:57.090> going

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
gnarled so we know unfortunately going

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.940 
gnarled so we know unfortunately going
up<00:01:57.540> against<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.960> government<00:01:58.469> automatic

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
up against the government automatic

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.160 
up against the government automatic
would<00:01:59.159> be<00:01:59.310> an<00:01:59.460> incredibly<00:02:00.119> crazy<00:02:00.540> thing<00:02:00.960> for

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
would be an incredibly crazy thing for

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.139 
would be an incredibly crazy thing for
Naruto<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:02.070> would<00:02:02.159> be<00:02:02.250> just<00:02:02.520> so<00:02:02.579> different

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
Naruto and it would be just so different

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.030 
Naruto and it would be just so different
like<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:04.049> know<00:02:04.110> having<00:02:04.469> such<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.710> different

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
like you know having such a different

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.530 
like you know having such a different
atmosphere<00:02:05.189> it's<00:02:05.670> thrown<00:02:05.969> oral<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.390> win

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
atmosphere it's thrown oral to win

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.300 
atmosphere it's thrown oral to win
because<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:07.049> just<00:02:07.259> be<00:02:07.409> like<00:02:07.590> what<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.190> heck

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
because you just be like what the heck

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.469 
because you just be like what the heck
am<00:02:08.340> I<00:02:08.550> supposed<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.879> do<00:02:09.000> in<00:02:09.119> these<00:02:09.239> situations

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
am I supposed to do in these situations

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.270 
am I supposed to do in these situations
but<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:10.259> definitely<00:02:10.679> think<00:02:10.800> it<00:02:11.009> would<00:02:11.129> be<00:02:11.250> a

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
but I definitely think it would be a

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.020 
but I definitely think it would be a
very<00:02:11.670> very<00:02:12.060> hard<00:02:12.330> task

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
very very hard task

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.520 
very very hard task
but<00:02:13.150> now<00:02:13.270> also<00:02:13.540> try<00:02:13.750> to<00:02:13.780> become<00:02:14.110> Pirate<00:02:14.410> King

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
but now also try to become Pirate King

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.350 
but now also try to become Pirate King
because<00:02:14.830> there's<00:02:15.400> something<00:02:15.610> special<00:02:16.090> you

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
because there's something special you

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.699 
because there's something special you
kind<00:02:16.600> of<00:02:16.660> gotta<00:02:16.840> have<00:02:17.080> and<00:02:17.350> you<00:02:17.560> know<00:02:17.650> of

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
kind of gotta have and you know of

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.140 
kind of gotta have and you know of
course<00:02:17.860> is<00:02:18.069> the<00:02:18.190> will<00:02:18.370> of<00:02:18.490> D<00:02:18.640> and<00:02:18.910> you<00:02:19.060> know

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
course is the will of D and you know

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.059 
course is the will of D and you know
it's<00:02:19.450> just<00:02:19.630> a<00:02:19.690> whole<00:02:19.870> different<00:02:20.200> story<00:02:20.380> and<00:02:20.709> I

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
it's just a whole different story and I

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.680 
it's just a whole different story and I
don't<00:02:21.100> necessarily<00:02:21.370> know<00:02:22.000> if<00:02:22.030> not<00:02:22.240> also<00:02:22.480> could

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
don't necessarily know if not also could

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.390 
don't necessarily know if not also could
become<00:02:22.990> Pirate<00:02:23.290> King<00:02:23.410> but<00:02:23.620> I<00:02:23.800> do<00:02:23.920> think<00:02:24.220> that

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
become Pirate King but I do think that

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.710 
become Pirate King but I do think that
he'd<00:02:24.580> have<00:02:24.730> an<00:02:24.850> incredible<00:02:25.300> time<00:02:25.480> and

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
he'd have an incredible time and

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.230 
he'd have an incredible time and
possibly<00:02:26.100> enjoy<00:02:27.100> himself<00:02:27.340> a<00:02:27.640> lot<00:02:27.819> more<00:02:28.060> than

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
possibly enjoy himself a lot more than

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.729 
possibly enjoy himself a lot more than
in<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.540> world<00:02:28.750> that<00:02:28.930> he<00:02:29.080> lives<00:02:29.290> in<00:02:29.470> just

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
in the world that he lives in just

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.080 
in the world that he lives in just
because<00:02:29.980> of<00:02:30.069> the<00:02:30.130> fact<00:02:30.310> that<00:02:30.550> he's<00:02:30.700> just<00:02:30.730> with

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
because of the fact that he's just with

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.790 
because of the fact that he's just with
his<00:02:31.239> friends<00:02:31.690> on<00:02:31.810> a<00:02:31.840> boat<00:02:32.170> you<00:02:32.410> know<00:02:32.530> just

going on adventures and journeys that is

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.300 
going on adventures and journeys that is
something<00:02:34.989> completely<00:02:35.350> different<00:02:35.739> than<00:02:36.160> his

now<00:02:42.520> with<00:02:42.819> Luffy<00:02:43.360> trying<00:02:43.660> to<00:02:43.750> become<00:02:43.989> Hokage<00:02:44.200> I

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
now with Luffy trying to become Hokage I

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.110 
now with Luffy trying to become Hokage I
think<00:02:45.280> it<00:02:45.430> would<00:02:45.580> have<00:02:45.700> been<00:02:45.730> a<00:02:45.880> very

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
think it would have been a very

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.910 
think it would have been a very
interesting<00:02:46.510> journey<00:02:47.050> but<00:02:47.470> start<00:02:47.739> as<00:02:47.890> a

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
interesting journey but start as a

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.110 
interesting journey but start as a
bloopy<00:02:48.310> never<00:02:48.489> had<00:02:48.670> friends<00:02:49.000> in<00:02:49.060> the

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
bloopy never had friends in the

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.729 
bloopy never had friends in the
beginning<00:02:49.450> I<00:02:49.660> don't<00:02:49.720> even<00:02:49.870> think<00:02:49.989> Luffy<00:02:50.440> still

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
beginning I don't even think Luffy still

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.170 
beginning I don't even think Luffy still
would<00:02:50.950> have<00:02:50.980> been<00:02:51.070> like<00:02:51.340> all<00:02:51.580> that<00:02:51.790> depressed

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
would have been like all that depressed

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.520 
would have been like all that depressed
or<00:02:52.330> anything<00:02:52.480> or<00:02:52.690> down<00:02:52.840> like<00:02:53.019> gnarled<00:02:53.380> so

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
or anything or down like gnarled so

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:54.900 
or anything or down like gnarled so
first<00:02:53.890> thing<00:02:54.010> about<00:02:54.070> Luffy<00:02:54.519> is<00:02:54.550> he's<00:02:54.760> not<00:02:54.880> a

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
first thing about Luffy is he's not a

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.060 
first thing about Luffy is he's not a
man<00:02:55.120> that<00:02:55.150> really<00:02:55.390> thinks<00:02:55.870> he's<00:02:56.050> men<00:02:56.350> more<00:02:56.830> so

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
man that really thinks he's men more so

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.120 
man that really thinks he's men more so
that<00:02:57.280> reacts<00:02:57.819> to<00:02:58.090> stuff<00:02:58.330> and<00:02:58.680> with<00:02:59.680> people<00:02:59.980> not

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
that reacts to stuff and with people not

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.350 
that reacts to stuff and with people not
like<00:03:00.370> you<00:03:00.550> know<00:03:00.670> wanting<00:03:00.910> to<00:03:00.970> be<00:03:01.030> his<00:03:01.120> friends

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
like you know wanting to be his friends

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.699 
like you know wanting to be his friends
you<00:03:01.450> probably<00:03:01.750> just<00:03:01.900> like<00:03:02.019> slap<00:03:02.319> someone<00:03:02.560> in

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
you probably just like slap someone in

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.110 
you probably just like slap someone in
the<00:03:02.769> back<00:03:02.980> really<00:03:03.190> hard<00:03:03.400> to<00:03:03.550> say<00:03:03.640> hey<00:03:03.819> why<00:03:04.060> you

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
the back really hard to say hey why you

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.820 
the back really hard to say hey why you
don't<00:03:04.300> want<00:03:04.420> to<00:03:04.480> be<00:03:04.569> my<00:03:04.690> friend<00:03:04.989> and<00:03:05.380> as<00:03:05.560> far<00:03:05.769> as

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
don't want to be my friend and as far as

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:06.990 
don't want to be my friend and as far as
going<00:03:06.190> after<00:03:06.459> Sasuke

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
going after Sasuke

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.059 
going after Sasuke
I<00:03:07.150> highly<00:03:08.019> doubt<00:03:08.050> Luffy<00:03:08.680> would<00:03:08.830> have<00:03:08.920> done

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
I highly doubt Luffy would have done

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.729 
I highly doubt Luffy would have done
anything<00:03:09.550> that<00:03:10.000> Naruto<00:03:10.780> did<00:03:11.050> Luffy<00:03:11.590> would

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
anything that Naruto did Luffy would

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:12.720 
anything that Naruto did Luffy would
have<00:03:11.830> been<00:03:11.950> on<00:03:12.040> some<00:03:12.280> you<00:03:12.370> know<00:03:12.430> I'm<00:03:12.489> gonna<00:03:12.610> be

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
have been on some you know I'm gonna be

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.160 
have been on some you know I'm gonna be
Chazz<00:03:13.120> if<00:03:13.330> you<00:03:13.450> want<00:03:13.630> to<00:03:13.690> leave<00:03:13.810> this<00:03:13.959> village

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
Chazz if you want to leave this village

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.960 
Chazz if you want to leave this village
and<00:03:14.620> he<00:03:14.860> wouldn't<00:03:15.130> have<00:03:15.190> chased<00:03:15.489> him<00:03:15.670> at<00:03:15.790> all

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
and he wouldn't have chased him at all

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.160 
and he wouldn't have chased him at all
to<00:03:16.090> be<00:03:16.180> honest<00:03:16.390> with<00:03:16.450> you<00:03:16.600> Luffy<00:03:16.930> would<00:03:17.079> have

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
to be honest with you Luffy would have

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.810 
to be honest with you Luffy would have
left<00:03:17.320> him<00:03:17.500> go<00:03:17.769> he<00:03:18.130> probably<00:03:18.400> would<00:03:18.640> have<00:03:18.700> been

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
left him go he probably would have been

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.370 
left him go he probably would have been
sad<00:03:19.120> about<00:03:19.299> it<00:03:19.600> but<00:03:19.810> you<00:03:19.959> know<00:03:20.079> the<00:03:20.170> thing

very<00:03:35.380> interesting<00:03:35.680> about<00:03:35.950> Luffy<00:03:36.489> and<00:03:36.670> as<00:03:36.880> far

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
very interesting about Luffy and as far

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.640 
very interesting about Luffy and as far
as<00:03:37.120> becoming<00:03:37.450> Hokage<00:03:37.630> I<00:03:37.989> think<00:03:38.260> Luffy<00:03:38.530> would

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
as becoming Hokage I think Luffy would

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.199 
as becoming Hokage I think Luffy would
actually<00:03:38.980> make<00:03:39.100> a<00:03:39.130> pretty<00:03:39.340> awesome<00:03:39.700> Hokage

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
actually make a pretty awesome Hokage

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:41.670 
actually make a pretty awesome Hokage
but<00:03:40.450> he<00:03:40.510> probably<00:03:40.720> would<00:03:41.019> have<00:03:41.049> won<00:03:41.260> it<00:03:41.410> cuz<00:03:41.560> to

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
but he probably would have won it cuz to

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.560 
but he probably would have won it cuz to
be<00:03:41.769> honest<00:03:42.040> Luffy<00:03:42.340> Connor<00:03:42.579> and<00:03:42.850> some<00:03:43.269> weird

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
be honest Luffy Connor and some weird

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.930 
be honest Luffy Connor and some weird
way<00:03:43.870> reminds<00:03:44.320> me<00:03:44.470> a<00:03:44.500> little<00:03:44.859> bit<00:03:45.190> of<00:03:45.370> Jiraiya

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
way reminds me a little bit of Jiraiya

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.550 
way reminds me a little bit of Jiraiya
in<00:03:46.239> the<00:03:46.329> sense<00:03:46.510> that<00:03:46.570> he<00:03:46.780> loves<00:03:46.959> the<00:03:47.109> adventure

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
in the sense that he loves the adventure

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.690 
in the sense that he loves the adventure
he<00:03:47.709> doesn't<00:03:47.980> want<00:03:48.100> to<00:03:48.130> be<00:03:48.220> sitting<00:03:48.519> in<00:03:48.609> a<00:03:48.670> chair

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
he doesn't want to be sitting in a chair

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.360 
he doesn't want to be sitting in a chair
at<00:03:49.150> all<00:03:49.420> you<00:03:50.140> know<00:03:50.260> looking<00:03:50.530> at<00:03:50.680> papers<00:03:51.160> and

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
at all you know looking at papers and

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.160 
at all you know looking at papers and
planning<00:03:52.150> attacks<00:03:52.450> nothing<00:03:52.810> like<00:03:52.900> that<00:03:53.049> he

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
planning attacks nothing like that he

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.289 
planning attacks nothing like that he
wants<00:03:53.350> to<00:03:53.470> be<00:03:53.590> on<00:03:53.799> the<00:03:53.829> mission<00:03:54.250> so<00:03:54.790> I<00:03:54.820> doubt<00:03:55.120> he

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
wants to be on the mission so I doubt he

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.210 
wants to be on the mission so I doubt he
would<00:03:55.390> ever<00:03:55.540> even<00:03:55.690> accept<00:03:56.140> Hokage<00:03:56.650> even<00:03:57.100> if

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
would ever even accept Hokage even if

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.800

ever<00:04:04.810> become<00:04:04.989> Hokage<00:04:05.290> because<00:04:05.829> you<00:04:05.950> wouldn't

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
ever become Hokage because you wouldn't
