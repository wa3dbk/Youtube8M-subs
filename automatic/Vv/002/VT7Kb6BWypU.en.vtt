one<00:00:07.180> of<00:00:07.269> my<00:00:07.359> favorite<00:00:07.720> things<00:00:07.899> to<00:00:07.990> do<00:00:08.200> in<00:00:08.349> ride

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:08.530 
one of my favorite things to do in ride

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.680 
one of my favorite things to do in ride
building<00:00:08.980> is<00:00:09.129> to<00:00:09.490> build<00:00:09.639> custom<00:00:10.180> grips<00:00:10.420> with

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:10.690 
building is to build custom grips with

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.529 
building is to build custom grips with
car<00:00:10.959> careens<00:00:11.260> I<00:00:11.559> have<00:00:12.369> two<00:00:12.580> examples<00:00:13.119> here<00:00:13.299> of

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:13.539 
car careens I have two examples here of

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:15.480 
car careens I have two examples here of
what<00:00:14.020> we<00:00:14.109> call<00:00:14.289> a<00:00:14.320> split<00:00:14.529> grille<00:00:14.980> and<00:00:15.430> the

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:15.490 
what we call a split grille and the

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.640 
what we call a split grille and the
split<00:00:15.879> grip<00:00:16.150> is<00:00:16.420> where<00:00:16.869> the<00:00:16.990> rear<00:00:17.199> grip<00:00:17.410> of<00:00:17.590> the

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:17.650 
split grip is where the rear grip of the

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.490 
split grip is where the rear grip of the
ride<00:00:17.830> has<00:00:18.430> part<00:00:18.760> of<00:00:18.820> the<00:00:18.880> blank<00:00:19.150> exposed<00:00:19.689> I<00:00:20.080> can

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.500 
ride has part of the blank exposed I can

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.929 
ride has part of the blank exposed I can
think<00:00:20.680> of<00:00:20.830> three<00:00:21.070> reasons<00:00:21.099> to<00:00:21.580> be<00:00:21.730> able<00:00:21.880> to

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:21.939 
think of three reasons to be able to

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:24.900 
think of three reasons to be able to
split<00:00:22.119> grip<00:00:22.450> first<00:00:23.350> its<00:00:24.010> performance<00:00:24.700> and

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:24.910 
split grip first its performance and

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.270 
split grip first its performance and
this<00:00:25.660> really<00:00:25.990> does<00:00:26.350> work<00:00:26.650> for<00:00:26.860> me

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:27.280 
this really does work for me

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.070 
this really does work for me
second<00:00:28.030> it<00:00:28.150> saves<00:00:28.449> you<00:00:28.570> a<00:00:28.630> little<00:00:28.779> money

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080 
second it saves you a little money

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.870 
second it saves you a little money
because<00:00:29.500> car<00:00:30.039> curring<00:00:30.279> have<00:00:30.490> gotten

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
because car curring have gotten

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.630 
because car curring have gotten
expensive<00:00:31.480> third<00:00:32.020> it<00:00:32.739> just<00:00:32.949> looks<00:00:33.190> good<00:00:33.399> in

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
expensive third it just looks good in

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.090 
expensive third it just looks good in
this<00:00:34.420> video<00:00:34.809> I'd<00:00:35.289> like<00:00:35.530> to<00:00:35.590> show<00:00:35.829> you<00:00:35.890> the

this video I'd like to show you the
steps<00:00:36.370> of<00:00:36.579> how<00:00:36.730> we<00:00:36.789> build<00:00:37.180> a<00:00:37.329> spec<00:00:37.539> grip<00:00:37.890> I've

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
steps of how we build a spec grip I've

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.040 
steps of how we build a spec grip I've
got<00:00:39.159> a<00:00:39.190> drawing<00:00:39.519> here<00:00:39.789> representing<00:00:40.479> the<00:00:40.629> grip

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
got a drawing here representing the grip

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.770 
got a drawing here representing the grip
that<00:00:41.260> I'm<00:00:41.499> going<00:00:41.679> to<00:00:41.710> make<00:00:42.069> and<00:00:42.479> these<00:00:43.479> car

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
that I'm going to make and these car

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.829 
that I'm going to make and these car
currents<00:00:44.079> here<00:00:44.319> represent<00:00:44.920> this<00:00:45.069> rear<00:00:45.399> grip

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:45.839 
currents here represent this rear grip

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:48.989 
currents here represent this rear grip
these<00:00:46.839> car<00:00:47.079> creams<00:00:47.379> represent<00:00:48.249> that<00:00:48.399> front

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:48.999 
these car creams represent that front

00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:50.819 
these car creams represent that front
part<00:00:49.210> of<00:00:49.300> the<00:00:49.389> rear<00:00:49.690> grip<00:00:49.929> and<00:00:50.199> the<00:00:50.409> two<00:00:50.589> car

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
part of the rear grip and the two car

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:52.770 
part of the rear grip and the two car
creams<00:00:51.100> represent<00:00:51.670> that<00:00:51.879> little<00:00:52.210> fore<00:00:52.600> grip

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
creams represent that little fore grip

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.319 
creams represent that little fore grip
now<00:00:53.589> it's<00:00:53.739> time<00:00:53.949> to<00:00:53.979> remount<00:00:54.429> these<00:00:54.699> car<00:00:54.969> inks

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:55.329 
now it's time to remount these car inks

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.469 
now it's time to remount these car inks
for<00:00:55.420> this<00:00:55.569> grip<00:00:55.870> and<00:00:56.409> I<00:00:56.499> do<00:00:56.579> this<00:00:57.579> same<00:00:57.879> blank<00:00:58.239> a

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:58.479 
for this grip and I do this same blank a

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:01.889 
for this grip and I do this same blank a
lot<00:00:58.780> so<00:00:59.649> I<00:01:00.039> have<00:01:00.609> a<00:01:00.639> reamer<00:01:01.030> that<00:01:01.299> matches<00:01:01.690> the

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
lot so I have a reamer that matches the

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:04.979 
lot so I have a reamer that matches the
exact<00:01:02.620> taper<00:01:02.889> of<00:01:03.129> that<00:01:03.280> blank<00:01:03.609> and<00:01:03.940> I<00:01:03.989> know

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
exact taper of that blank and I know

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.719 
exact taper of that blank and I know
where<00:01:05.290> to<00:01:05.320> push<00:01:05.560> those<00:01:05.740> car<00:01:06.010> currents<00:01:06.310> up<00:01:06.520> on

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
where to push those car currents up on

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.719 
where to push those car currents up on
that<00:01:06.940> reamer<00:01:07.450> so<00:01:08.229> I<00:01:08.260> slide<00:01:08.979> them<00:01:09.159> on<00:01:09.310> there<00:01:09.549> I

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
that reamer so I slide them on there I

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.610 
that reamer so I slide them on there I
always<00:01:10.150> like<00:01:10.390> to<00:01:10.420> do<00:01:10.690> several<00:01:11.170> car<00:01:11.380> cranks

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.620 
always like to do several car cranks

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.110 
always like to do several car cranks
together<00:01:12.010> one<00:01:12.310> time<00:01:12.490> that<00:01:12.700> keeps<00:01:12.880> them

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
together one time that keeps them

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.230 
together one time that keeps them
straighter<00:01:13.450> and<00:01:14.430> I'll<00:01:15.430> slide<00:01:15.760> on<00:01:15.910> that<00:01:16.030> little

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
straighter and I'll slide on that little

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.880 
straighter and I'll slide on that little
fore<00:01:16.510> grip<00:01:16.720> and<00:01:17.910> you<00:01:18.910> know<00:01:19.030> I'll<00:01:19.270> leave<00:01:19.480> that

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
fore grip and you know I'll leave that

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.800 
fore grip and you know I'll leave that
I'll<00:01:20.890> leave<00:01:21.130> that<00:01:21.160> reamer<00:01:22.150> running<00:01:22.660> while

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
I'll leave that reamer running while

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.380 
I'll leave that reamer running while
I'll<00:01:22.900> take<00:01:23.110> those<00:01:23.290> car<00:01:23.560> careens<00:01:23.830> off<00:01:24.070> and<00:01:24.490> I'll

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
I'll take those car careens off and I'll

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.070 
I'll take those car careens off and I'll
stand<00:01:25.660> them<00:01:25.870> up<00:01:26.020> with<00:01:26.620> the<00:01:26.740> taper<00:01:26.980> down<00:01:28.080> try

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
stand them up with the taper down try

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.750 
stand them up with the taper down try
not<00:01:29.260> to<00:01:29.410> knock<00:01:29.590> them<00:01:29.800> over<00:01:29.890> and<00:01:30.220> get<00:01:30.550> them<00:01:30.610> out

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
not to knock them over and get them out

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
not to knock them over and get them out
of<00:01:30.790> line<00:01:31.830> slide<00:01:32.830> that<00:01:33.040> rear<00:01:33.250> grip<00:01:33.460> off<00:01:33.780> and

we're<00:01:34.960> ready<00:01:35.170> for<00:01:35.230> the<00:01:35.410> next<00:01:35.590> step<00:01:36.180> now

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
we're ready for the next step now

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.210 
we're ready for the next step now
without<00:01:37.540> gluing<00:01:37.870> the<00:01:38.230> car<00:01:38.470> currents<00:01:38.770> I<00:01:38.950> slew

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
without gluing the car currents I slew

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.430 
without gluing the car currents I slew
them<00:01:39.340> all<00:01:39.490> into<00:01:39.730> place<00:01:40.060> just<00:01:40.390> to<00:01:41.080> see<00:01:41.290> how

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
them all into place just to see how

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.560 
them all into place just to see how
everything<00:01:41.860> fits<00:01:42.100> and<00:01:42.250> it<00:01:42.400> fits<00:01:42.610> good<00:01:42.850> okay<00:01:43.540> I

about 20 minutes to work with instead of

five minutes with five minute epoxy I'll

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.559 
five minutes with five minute epoxy I'll
measure<00:02:44.310> out<00:02:44.519> equal<00:02:44.849> portions<00:02:45.299> on<00:02:45.540> a

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
through we have a video on mixing epoxy

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.420 
through we have a video on mixing epoxy
so<00:02:54.540> if<00:02:55.349> you<00:02:55.500> haven't<00:02:55.799> watched<00:02:55.980> that<00:02:56.190> may<00:02:56.370> be

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
so if you haven't watched that may be

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.430 
so if you haven't watched that may be
able<00:02:56.700> to<00:02:56.760> go<00:02:56.849> back<00:02:57.030> and<00:02:57.209> watch<00:02:57.359> that<00:02:57.440> I'll

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
able to go back and watch that I'll

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.170 
able to go back and watch that I'll
brush<00:02:58.739> you<00:02:58.889> a<00:02:58.950> little<00:02:59.159> bit<00:02:59.250> on<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.489> blank<00:02:59.819> and

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
brush you a little bit on the blank and

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.759 
brush you a little bit on the blank and
I'll<00:03:01.049> slide<00:03:01.349> that<00:03:01.620> car<00:03:01.889> crane<00:03:02.159> up<00:03:03.290> up<00:03:04.290> and<00:03:04.620> get

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
I'll slide that car crane up up and get

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.069 
I'll slide that car crane up up and get
that<00:03:04.920> glue<00:03:05.159> in<00:03:05.310> there<00:03:05.519> up<00:03:06.060> in<00:03:06.299> that<00:03:06.540> car<00:03:06.810> cream

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
that glue in there up in that car cream

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.229 
that glue in there up in that car cream
and<00:03:07.349> then<00:03:07.439> I'll<00:03:07.590> slide<00:03:07.920> it<00:03:07.950> right<00:03:08.250> back<00:03:08.430> down

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
and then I'll slide it right back down

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.270 
and then I'll slide it right back down
so<00:03:09.870> there's<00:03:10.019> no<00:03:10.139> glue<00:03:10.409> on<00:03:10.590> that<00:03:10.769> back<00:03:10.980> side

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
so there's no glue on that back side

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.940 
so there's no glue on that back side
over<00:03:11.609> there<00:03:11.760> and<00:03:12.260> but<00:03:13.260> there's<00:03:13.439> a<00:03:13.500> little<00:03:13.739> glue

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
over there and but there's a little glue

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.550 
over there and but there's a little glue
underneath<00:03:14.549> that<00:03:14.700> car<00:03:15.030> cream<00:03:15.329> I'll<00:03:16.319> go<00:03:16.500> ahead

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
underneath that car cream I'll go ahead

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.050 
underneath that car cream I'll go ahead
and<00:03:16.739> finish<00:03:16.859> gluing<00:03:17.189> up<00:03:17.400> all<00:03:17.579> those<00:03:17.790> car

about<00:03:32.459> it<00:03:32.669> I<00:03:32.819> think<00:03:33.120> about<00:03:33.239> 1/32<00:03:34.230> inch<00:03:34.319> gap<00:03:34.799> in

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
about it I think about 1/32 inch gap in
