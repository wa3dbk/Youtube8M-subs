00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:06.590
 hello and welcome back to this video 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.990
 I hope you find it useful 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:12.200
 in this exercise the tan will be used 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:15.080
 known loop for the exercise in 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:19.400
 issue says write a program in 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:24.190
 java that reads a number n greater than 0 and 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:26.930
 I calculated the following sum 12 masters 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:29.510
 up more n 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.419
 therefore we must write a program 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.640
 that asks the user for a whole number 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.190
 greater than zero 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.980
 if the entered number is greater than 0 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.140
 then the loop will start running 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.989
 for that will be responsible for adding all the 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:48.170
 numbers starting from number 1 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.180
 until you reach the number entered by 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.930
 example if the user enters the 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:57.170
 number 4 one should add one plus two 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:00.690
 plus 3 and 4 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:04.309
 knowing this we can begin 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.309
 we create our project 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.710
 and we also create our kind of 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.710
 principal 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.350
 we introduce the main 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:28.570
 and we can define the variable that 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:32.020
 we know we're going to need type 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:35.420
 whole the variable n that variable will be 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.159
 the number that the user must enter 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.890
 so the user can enter what 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:43.090
 you need an entry method for it 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.090
 use in the scanner class 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.829
 to use the cannes classes we must 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.829
 import that library 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:03.970
 I have done this we must ask him now 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.970
 to the user the number that he will enter 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.570
 once this is done we can check 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.930
 that will receive a value entered by the 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.049
 user 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:32.140
 but we do not know if it is greater or less than 0 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:35.579
 therefore we must check it before 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:41.609
 continue using the if elx statement 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:41.609
 so if the value of n is greater than 0 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.020
 then the loop will occur 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.720
 we want and the one that we are 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:54.490
 looking for that is the one that is going to add everything 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.490
 we will execute the loop four 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.960
 that would start from 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:05.430
 the value 1 this means that the 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:08.420
 variable and start with the value 1 the 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.650
 variable and it is a counter 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:16.430
 the forum loop will continue to run 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:18.660
 as long as iu is less than or equal to 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.440
 variable n 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.690
 at the moment in which y is the same as 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.940
 n 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.940
 that loop will stop running 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:39.370
 and every time the loop reaches the end 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:43.950
 the variable and add to a value 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.950
 that is if for example I put 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:55.190
 which is equal to 2 at the time when 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:58.340
 the loop reaches the end will return to 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:03.080
 run but instead of being worth 1 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:05.750
 will be worth 12 then you will lose 3 in 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:09.640
 our case we want it to rise from one in 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:13.240
 one so you can stay 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:16.730
 and is equal to 1 or what is the same and 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:19.910
 more more the result will be the same 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:23.510
 once the for loop is manufactured 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:26.180
 we must tell him that part of the code is 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:30.140
 must run every time it runs on 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.880
 said loop in this case we should by 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.990
 example I will create a new variable 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.990
 call end 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:41.330
 that from the beginning will be worth 0 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.740
 then said variable every time it 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:48.009
 execute add the current value that you have 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:50.050
 plus the value of i 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:54.210
 therefore the first time it is executed 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:57.639
 add to 0 what is to speak or act in order 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:01.350
 plus the value of y that is 1 therefore end 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:05.280
 you will lose 1 when you run again 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:07.560
 end is worth one plus the value of and that in 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:11.400
 this case will be worth then will end lose 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:13.670
 three and this will be added up to reach the 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.670
 final 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:21.380
 practically the exercise is solved 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:24.540
 because if n is greater than 0 will be executed 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:27.810
 but and if n is not greater than 0 then 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:30.630
 we must finish the sentence if elx it 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:33.170
 we incorporate the els and send a 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.170
 Error message 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:48.280
 therefore if the value of n is not greater than 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.280
 0 this loop would not be executed 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:55.069
 Finally 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:57.930
 when we finish doing everything 

00:05:55.069 --> 00:06:01.480
 we should print on the screen the 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:04.210
 value of the sum of the final value 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:07.950
 therefore outside the loop we must 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.950
 write the value 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:16.480
 you have to pay attention that this 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.530
 line the one entered inside the 

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:20.020
 judgment 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:23.370
 since if I write it out it will be printed 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:25.780
 equally whether n is greater or lesser 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:28.270
 but instead if I introduce it inside 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.790
 if it will be printed only if it is 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:33.880
 condition is met in the event that no 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:37.220
 it is fulfilled only it will be printed that the 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:38.960
 value entered is not greater than 0 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.790
 so we will execute it and 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.530
 we will check that I am right 

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:46.830
 for example I will try to introduce 

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:48.240
 minus 5 is a number less than zero by 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.140
 so much is telling me that the value 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.060
 inserted 

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:53.700
 is not greater than zero 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:56.130
 but let's go again this time I'm going to put 

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:58.320
 0 should also give me the same 

00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:00.740
 error because we are looking for a number 

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.740
 higher 

00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:06.089
 let's imagine that now I write number 5 

00:07:03.929 --> 00:07:10.499
 then it returns to me that the total value 

00:07:06.089 --> 00:07:17.500
 is 15 because he has made the sum of 12 

00:07:10.499 --> 00:07:19.930
 + 3 4 and 5 the total value is 15 

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:23.680
 in this exercise it has been used as 

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:24.670
 I already said the for loop and also also the 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.550
 judgment 

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:30.490
 els to check that the value is greater 

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:32.680
 to zero the code since exercise is 

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:34.840
 found in the description of the video if 

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.640
 have any questions or can you comment 

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:39.070
 in the video I will try to help everything 

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.430
 possible if you liked it and it has served you 

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:42.220
 of help

 give me a like or subscribe you will help me 

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:47.920
 enormously so you will not miss 

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:50.370
 none of my new videos a greeting and 

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.370
 until next time
