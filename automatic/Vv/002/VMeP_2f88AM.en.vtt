00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:16.360
 then the ingredients for ours 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:23.040
 chocolate and hazelnut cookies are 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:31.090
 125 g of flour 170 grams of sugar 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:35.559
 an egg 100 g of butter 2 tablespoons of 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:40.030
 baking powder a pinch of salt 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:43.120
 a sachet of vanillin and then a flight 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.750
 this here that I give you the doses but in 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:50.710
 actually here you can both add and 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:53.890
 remove and / or chopped 150 170 grams of 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.290
 milk chocolate will be preferred 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:02.520
 you can use that with white 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:07.149
 dark chocolate 50 g of peeled almonds e 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:10.690
 about 150 grams of hazelnuts I have 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:13.330
 roughly chopped then how 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.920
 you see ingredients are a little high 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.110
 because I didn't want to do the double dose 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:23.979
 but a thing and a half 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:30.430
 so I go to add the sugar and 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:32.619
 the butter that will go to work explains ho 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.950
 created a compound of the kind that 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:39.040
 continue to work it too, too 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.690
 if the butter has become soft and well o 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.210
 evil were amalgamated all 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.619
 ingredients then inside it 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.860
 given to add my sachet of 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.860
 vanillin 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.789
 and then I apologize if the light is 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.770
 changed however saw position changed 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:00.030
 that I realized there was too much 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.969
 little lynch 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.340
 so after mixing well the 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.679
 butter with sugar and added mine 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:16.920
 vanillina go to add mine 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:23.370
 new amalgami for good the mixture I go 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:26.390
 then to add my flour e 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.390
 half a bag of yeast 

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:59.439
 insulted is a very short pastry 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:07.889
 soft so let's add the 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:07.889
 chocolate almonds and hazelnuts 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:14.370
 as you see at the end one who has more 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:18.159
 more you put it 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:22.120
 it depends on the tastes here's what to do in 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:30.099
 lightly bend your hands a little 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:33.040
 of compound a life ball and the 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:35.939
 we lay on our baking tray 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.439
 let's continue with all the compound 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:40.329
 in this case I will not make balls 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:45.340
 so great because they are guests anyway 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:48.519
 they will be many so go and position them 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.930
 leaving some distance between them 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:56.439
 because they will rise and flatten out 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:58.989
 so I continue our cookies we'll go 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:01.509
 now to let them rest in the fridge already 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.959
 made cases for about twenty 

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:03.909
 minutes 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.790
 just remember to leave some 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:09.250
 distance between cookies then challenges 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.439
 I'll show you that a little bit anyway 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.109
 will limit but so will flatten and 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:17.199
 so everyone would stick 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:19.630
 so girls here are our cookies 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:22.750
 baked, of course, are only one 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:25.570
 part as you see they do not listen yet 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.840
 a little bit full they are full of hazelnuts 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.430
 of chocolate I away 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:35.159
 I invite you to do them because they really are 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.159
 exceptional and we turn to the next video
