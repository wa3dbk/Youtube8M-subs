00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
on strengths I've been working with

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.510 
on strengths I've been working with
young<00:00:14.940> people<00:00:15.299> for<00:00:15.630> many<00:00:15.809> years<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:17.279> lot<00:00:17.460> of

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
young people for many years and a lot of

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.279 
young people for many years and a lot of
people<00:00:17.910> that<00:00:18.060> work<00:00:18.270> with<00:00:18.449> young<00:00:18.630> people<00:00:18.690> get

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
people that work with young people get

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.290 
people that work with young people get
very<00:00:19.439> worried<00:00:19.920> about<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.580> problems<00:00:21.060> that

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
very worried about the problems that

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.810 
very worried about the problems that
they<00:00:21.689> see<00:00:21.720> young<00:00:22.080> people<00:00:22.109> facing<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.010> I<00:00:23.580> think

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
they see young people facing and I think

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.970 
they see young people facing and I think
sometimes<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.510> real<00:00:24.689> fear<00:00:24.960> rises<00:00:25.380> up<00:00:25.560> in<00:00:25.769> both

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
sometimes a real fear rises up in both

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.509 
sometimes a real fear rises up in both
parents<00:00:27.050> teachers<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.080> youth<00:00:28.560> workers<00:00:28.980> that

parents teachers and youth workers that

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.160 
parents teachers and youth workers that
we've<00:00:29.670> got<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.849> rush<00:00:30.119> in<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.599> fix<00:00:30.840> those

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
we've got a rush in and fix those

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.590 
we've got a rush in and fix those
problems<00:00:31.619> when<00:00:32.309> in<00:00:32.430> fact<00:00:32.610> what<00:00:32.850> we<00:00:32.969> do<00:00:33.149> then<00:00:33.390> is

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
problems when in fact what we do then is

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.750 
problems when in fact what we do then is
short-circuit<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.649> process<00:00:35.100> of<00:00:35.280> resilience

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
short-circuit the process of resilience

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.360 
short-circuit the process of resilience
developing<00:00:36.360> so<00:00:37.140> what<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.350> love<00:00:37.680> about<00:00:38.070> their

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
developing so what I love about their

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.280 
developing so what I love about their
resilience<00:00:38.730> donut<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.870> sets<00:00:40.079> up<00:00:40.260> a

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
resilience donut is that it sets up a

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.590 
resilience donut is that it sets up a
process<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:41.070> enable<00:00:41.309> young<00:00:41.670> people<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:42.090> face

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
process to enable young people to face

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
I've observed in the field of mental

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.450 
I've observed in the field of mental
health<00:01:09.960> whether<00:01:10.470> it's<00:01:10.590> talking<00:01:11.010> with<00:01:11.310> other

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
health whether it's talking with other

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.030 
health whether it's talking with other
psychologists<00:01:12.360> or<00:01:12.600> with<00:01:12.900> counselors<00:01:13.799> in<00:01:13.950> a

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
psychologists or with counselors in a

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.940 
psychologists or with counselors in a
school<00:01:14.400> context<00:01:15.060> is<00:01:15.390> that<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.290> training<00:01:16.680> that

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
school context is that the training that

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.499 
school context is that the training that
we've<00:01:17.070> received<00:01:17.250> in<00:01:17.759> mental<00:01:18.060> health<00:01:18.240> has

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
we've received in mental health has

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.870 
we've received in mental health has
focused<00:01:18.930> so<00:01:19.049> much<00:01:19.080> on<00:01:19.380> diagnosis<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.340> so

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
focused so much on diagnosis and so

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.010 
focused so much on diagnosis and so
often<00:01:21.210> when<00:01:21.299> we're<00:01:21.450> working<00:01:21.540> with<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.840> young

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
often when we're working with a young

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.109 
often when we're working with a young
person<00:01:22.530> we're<00:01:22.740> very<00:01:22.920> quick<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.430> jump<00:01:23.670> in<00:01:23.850> and

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
person we're very quick to jump in and

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.510 
person we're very quick to jump in and
see<00:01:24.450> what<00:01:24.659> diagnosis<00:01:25.590> might<00:01:25.799> be<00:01:25.920> there<00:01:26.159> but

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
see what diagnosis might be there but

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.980 
see what diagnosis might be there but
then<00:01:26.939> sometimes<00:01:27.210> we<00:01:27.540> actually<00:01:27.780> find

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
then sometimes we actually find

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.870 
then sometimes we actually find
ourselves<00:01:28.170> stumped<00:01:28.829> as<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:28.979> well<00:01:29.460> what<00:01:29.640> do<00:01:29.790> I

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
ourselves stumped as to well what do I

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.910 
ourselves stumped as to well what do I
do<00:01:29.939> now<00:01:30.270> what's<00:01:30.780> going<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.020> be<00:01:31.140> helpful<00:01:31.710> in

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
do now what's going to be helpful in

what I love about the resilience donor

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.679 
what I love about the resilience donor
is<00:02:02.040> instead<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:02.640> diagnosing<00:02:03.450> what<00:02:03.600> the

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
is instead of diagnosing what the

straight into looking for what's working
and<00:02:07.860> finding<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.819> strengths<00:02:09.390> that<00:02:09.599> we<00:02:10.110> can

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
and finding the strengths that we can

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.500 
and finding the strengths that we can
actually<00:02:10.739> utilize<00:02:11.039> to<00:02:11.849> make<00:02:12.060> effective

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
that is that young people actually

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.300 
that is that young people actually
really<00:02:17.690> enjoy<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:18.110> process<00:02:18.290> of<00:02:18.770> using<00:02:19.130> the

their life and how we can build on that

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.810 
their life and how we can build on that
and<00:02:30.170> use<00:02:30.350> that<00:02:30.530> more<00:02:30.740> so<00:02:31.340> I<00:02:31.370> would<00:02:31.670> really

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
and use that more so I would really

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.310 
and use that more so I would really
encourage<00:02:31.910> anyone<00:02:32.690> out<00:02:32.810> there<00:02:32.960> who's

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
finding that it's quite difficult to get

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.680

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
and use the resilience doughnut to

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.040 
and use the resilience doughnut to
engage<00:02:43.490> that<00:02:43.730> person<00:02:43.940> on<00:02:44.300> what's<00:02:44.510> working<00:02:44.750> in
