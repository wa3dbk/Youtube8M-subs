 tv sold 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.279
 time in front of the bandit 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.949
 hello everyone and very well handled this case 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.840
 john shrubs unavoidable regions 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.840
 mediterranean and men 8 oral 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.300
 the oleander is very suitable 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.920
 at all the areas with soils 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.690
 salty and dry regions 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.760
 it's a plant maybe a very small 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.930
 little chilly though and we'll see 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.600
 just now that it's not a 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.150
 true laurels and that he has a rapport 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.070
 a relationship with a plant that is well 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.110
 known and who is the dipladenia if we go 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.900
 see it in detail right now I you 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.510
 so say that the dipladenia is everything 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.309
 simply a cousin of the oleander they 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.339
 both belong to the family 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.309
 apps in enough and we'll see in 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:05.549
 cutting an inflorescence of this laurels 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.310
 roses 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.409
 the similarity between the two plants 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.060
 especially at the level of the buttons we see 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.670
 although it's exactly the same type 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.490
 of flowers and we also have this flower in 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.100
 trumpet shape with here this base 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.380
 lengthened in the same way that we have it with 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.390
 our ten denia dishes we will find 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.829
 also in the same family the most mejia 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.630
 that is the flower of the temples that 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:30.270
 we see very commonly in asia and 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.159
 then also a beautiful climbers to 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.810
 big yellow flowers at the manda 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.429
 cathartic ah but that's really 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.799
 for the most spoiled areas in 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:39.689
 sun and in heat because of his 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.850
 belonging to the family of apos inas and 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.969
 the oleander really has nothing to do 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.369
 with laurel laurel of Apollon and 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:49.170
 even called him besides to the léandre 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.630
 in the middle ages to leer because of 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.299
 the very long leaf that looks like a 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.609
 little bit to that of the olive tree so who 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.219
 looks like a calf has like an olive tree 

00:01:56.609 --> 00:02:01.079
 for the scenarion botanists would have 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.880
 by the way to legendary the same with a 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.950
 leaf that looks like olive nerio 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.909
 even who just given radius maybe so 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.399
 of wet 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.649
 although it is a shrub that appreciates 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.360
 pretty much the dry places but we 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.730
 think especially that it was the name that he 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.250
 gave dioscoride from the first century 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.230
 after jesus christ so a very very 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.850
 very very long story of origin 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.890
 Asian since we meet him since 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.720
 Middle East to China 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.030
 the oleander has made its appearance in 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.830
 europe in 1596 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.390
 it was certainly brought by 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.060
 Chinese merchants and it 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.870
 perfectly adapted to the whole basin 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.370
 Mediterranean 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.260
 since today it is a plant 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.330
 totally naturalized that is to say it 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.010
 multiply absolutely 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.450
 naturally then it's really 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.280
 something very interesting this 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.989
 pink laurels because it is first 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.880
 with evergreen he keeps his 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.620
 foliage all year round in the regions 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.959
 it does not freeze they can bloom 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.730
 practically 12 months out of 12 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.580
 in the other regions he will start 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.810
 its flowering around the month of May and the 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.360
 give constantly 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.550
 it will be reconstituted over the months 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.500
 until october 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.850
 so be careful though it's also 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.590
 a real poison 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.150
 all the organs of the oleander the 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.420
 mainly its leaves encloses 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.880
 two cardio toxic principles that are 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.470
 glycosides that act on the 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.970
 heart rate slows him down a bit 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.100
 as of alain digitalis and provoke 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.989
 death very quickly it would be enough 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.220
 for a man to swallow pretty much 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.110
 the equivalent of a bay leaf 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.730
 rose to pass the armed left 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.890
 but obviously nobody is going to see 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.410
 the crazy idea of ​​eating this thing 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.510
 who is very hard who is extremely 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.670
 bitter and practically there is practically 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.329
 never accident with laurels 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.519
 roses on the other hand 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:40.560
 beware of pets 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.570
 you never know about toxicity 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.040
 laurel rose hill runs a story 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.140
 really dramatic that would have 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.739
 unfolded in 1802 during the war 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.900
 spain 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.780
 eight French soldiers who was going to arrive 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.390
 in bivouac kills two or three birds 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.799
 to eat and he was surrounded by a 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.650
 grove of oleanders they make a 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.299
 fire and he starts to skewer their 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.130
 poultry on laurel branches 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:03.870
 pink they make skewers it falls 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.609
 all that they eat the next morning 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.950
 six of them had died at their 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:10.829
 morality of laurel yes but laurel 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.410
 laurel-rose sauce loves to push the 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:15.480
 head to the sun and strawberry feet 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.039
 not really in the moisture but when 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.780
 even with a certain freshness 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:21.060
 Once he is an adult he adapts himself 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.890
 very much of the drought but if he 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.990
 yellows like this for example it's 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.729
 often a sign that he ran out of water or 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.010
 also maybe he's hungry and in these 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:30.810
 case we have a special fertilizer paul 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.060
 would you bring that regularly 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.680
 dissolved in a little water and it's going 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.210
 really give a boost to the 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.669
 plant then on the other hand if you 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.260
 notice leaves a little bit 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:43.350
 like these, that is to say so had 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.180
 brown spots on the side it wants 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.030
 to say that the plant is in a system 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.400
 a little bit too wet it does not help 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.080
 not much atmospheric moisture and 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.070
 so it lacks drought in these 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.080
 case there and it's a disease 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.670
 cryptogamic that comes to settle and 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.900
 then if you flip the sheet and 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.300
 same time you will be able to 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.310
 maybe met some enemies 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.170
 pretty uncomfortable who are 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.090
 junk and who come so 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.070
 invade our oleanders then there in 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.620
 these cases it is absolutely necessary to intervene 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.150
 with a warm antique in the case 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.770
 an extreme infestation like that 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.810
 that we found on his 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.050
 with oleander aphids and 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.460
 mealybugs use a product 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.440
 systemic during vegetation a 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.170
 systemic there is not much about 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.090
 the garden trade the thiacloprid which has 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:29.100
 in this product is very very effective 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.950
 because he's going to be absorbed by the 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:34.050
 leaf and will convey inside of 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.990
 the plant and therefore these insects 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.580
 sucking suckers will poison themselves and 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.110
 the action of this product is up to 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.880
 four-week course is put 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.010
 always protective gloves based 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.440
 nitrites to make treatments 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.390
 in order to protect your hands you 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.920
 note that laurel bloom 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.220
 rose occurs on shoots of 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.440
 year 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:55.500
 ie end rods 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.360
 and if he is not as powerful as this 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.130
 wonderful specimen and that he took a 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.090
 little fired shot like this one is 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.010
 well at the end of the season 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.780
 around October do not hesitate to 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.880
 give him a pretty pruner 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.410
 vigorous in order to reduce the 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.390
 vegetation because otherwise it goes 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.400
 completely get rid of the base 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:14.370
 as he does here so we'll get 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.810
 the push here so look it's this 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.850
 who made the flower this year 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.250
 that was last year and I'm going 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:22.710
 look for the first sheet that I 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:24.060
 found lower and I cut and if he 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.010
 there is no leaf there are 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:29.610
 bulges here we will not hesitate we're going 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:32.250
 also cut to that place so that's it 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:34.350
 is called a severe folding and must 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:36.090
 not do it of course every year but 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:37.250
 only when the plant has 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:40.530
 really need 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:42.330
 it changes a little bit the phenomenon but 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:44.550
 in the spring you will have some 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.650
 reboots now has watering 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:48.180
 regular fertilization this is the 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.740
 secret of the oleander for better 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.570
 know the plants and we will succeed 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.130
 your garden nothing do you good holidays 

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:54.810
 professionals then go see you 

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:56.930
 next week a new secret already 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:56.930
 the 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.330
