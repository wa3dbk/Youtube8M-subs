00:00:00.369 --> 00:00:09.190
 No. 3 Everybody today, I came out of Dell's xps 13 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:10.630
 2015 model is simply a review, I feel the simplicity of covering up until the end 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:14.440
 Let's share it once. 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:19.000
 I do not know what the bottom tower is. 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.810
 Spain First of all , what I have yesterday is now 13.3 inches 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.220
 That's it. 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:28.330
 Resolution is Apple HD 1920 1080 resolution 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:31.480
 Come on cpu contains Intel Core i5 cpu and 4 gigabytes of RAM 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:36.429
 I bought ssd as a basic type of 128 chips. 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:39.699
 There is now writing the specifications on the battery going 15 hours 

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:43.659
 If you do not use everything , 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:45.010
 If you are still thinking whether there's actually a very old writing writing more 

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:49.539
 It's been a long time. 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:54.909
 The weight is once 1.2kg, sometimes light. 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:59.530
 Once you see the design or can be said neglecting terrific design nodes 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:01:02.019
 I think it's a real hilarious screen, the bezel is also incredibly real, 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:07.210
 I feel that floating on the screen 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:08.260
 Hey build door is pretty much what I have built this MacBook Rom 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:14.140
 this 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:18.550
 I think it's the first time I have a laptop . 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:23.470
 The feeling of this door itself is a four-chamber urethane feel like a little aunt 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:28.270
 The key to which this touch came out of the keyboard itself 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:32.860
 Feeling the air and a good sounding language very jjondeuk 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:37.810
 Of course, the backlight also comes in, and the backlight is very spring in the palm. 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:42.340
 If you like the trackpad is now touching gamjjok very good. One drawback is now 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.210
 When you click clack clack sounds a bit cheap value ah very little going a long sleeve 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.080
 I do it. 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:50.650
 Yes, if you do not touch the touch, 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:55.630
 I do not know what to say. 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:02:00.820
 Oh well, it's usually a bit slow for ssd for this laptop in general 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:04.120
 But hadeoraguyo've still doing what I'm doing, and general map browsing 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.260
 Simply live without writing riding very quickly as soon as the herd all the applications 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.590
 I went in. 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:13.510
 Well , once again, the battery performance is very good. 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:17.859
 And the other thing is that the adapter now likes a billion- dollar warrant. 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:21.189
 There is always a fire in the part, and it's easy to find anything at night . 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:26.000
 The adapter according to the length portions plugging the cord 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:30.409
 It is adjustable and very well made. 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:34.189
 One drawback is that the bezel is too thin , 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:39.379
 There was no room for this webcam, so I went to the bottom of the US 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:42.409
 Yes, because what has now dwaetgi hyeongguk the word shoot up from the bottom of the Web key 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:46.760
 It automatically has a slight angle and its importance. 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:50.569
 The importance of angle just comes out a little bit like that in the strange 4 webcams 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:55.849
 The location is less why only the cam tightens again next mwonjin initially keep the plan top 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:57.560
 It's like Mike. It's white . 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:00.650
 It would not have seemed create 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:04.790
 I do not know how to fix the baby window problem. 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:07.220
 When you look at how butter fingers do the scrolling for Internet Explorer is a great word 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:11.569
 Well, it's a smooth skull. 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:15.530
 Oh, that's not a problem with Windows, if anything, such as for example Google Chrome for 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:18.019
 Yes, without a great urban poor that some saints Croix that can be very frustrating 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:23.750
 I felt that way . 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:28.250
 And once the display is the same, 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.269
 Nowadays, Glory 's display is only a credit . 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.329
 I did not adapt. 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:36.859
 Requirements can vary depending on personal preference. 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:44.949
 I hope you'll see it. Yes. This is it for today . 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:44.949
 It's very simple. Thank you for taking a look.
