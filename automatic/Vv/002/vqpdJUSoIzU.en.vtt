00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.510
 hi, everyone is a robe zone, I 'm here 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.420
 in this video to do some 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:22.750
 clarifications on the history of move of the 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:25.210
 dead and on the role he has in all of these 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.910
 zombie maps that have come out that 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.369
 they will come out also in the future then i 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.880
 details I will tell you now are 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:36.370
 insights in short will deserve 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:41.500
 maybe to understand a little better how he is 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:43.720
 going and of course are things that you 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.090
 I say so take the as you like 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.560
 in short, it's not an official stuff 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.560
 from the thrier that I am that I am 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:54.070
 saying then let's go with order 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:56.410
 first of all the blaze of the dead is one 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.480
 story let's say apart from the 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.490
 classic first map black ops 2 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.260
 let's say with zombie mode he made from 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.750
 a story a bit strange compared to 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.720
 first maps of black ops one in this 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.359
 note for the first time we do not resent the 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.030
 our characters talk in you for 

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:15.429
 characters I mean rit open and max in 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.450
 how the other three are not yet 

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:21.490
 Heard we don't hear our characters 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.670
 talk but let's say we have clues 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.369
 that make us understand that maybe they are there 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.600
 still somewhere as there is 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.600
 I note to this particular 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.179
 look at this red light in the sky 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.399
 when we go to the bridge over the bridge where 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:38.229
 lies the pana belly looking at the 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:40.450
 heaven we will see this moving light 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.719
 what can this light remind you of 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.759
 that the trenk never puts never puts 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:47.319
 random stuff so that light is up to them 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.030
 mean something 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:51.189
 now stand to mean everything by offering 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.690
 maxis that are just in that 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:56.390
 point of respect than on 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.760
 transit we hear the customary voice until 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.890
 just says a sorry first bonus I have to 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.860
 still get used to letters letters 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.390
 let's say and the air then that red light 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.420
 could really be ris 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.280
 orange ric.tof sorry also 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.920
 another thing the zombie eyes 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.060
 they are red who is controlling them who 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.120
 he is checking his eyes then 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.480
 let's recap the few yellow samanthas 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.420
 ric.tof blue eyes and eyes and reds can 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.390
 be maxis a no because we are in 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.880
 historical epoch a bit too much for some 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.400
 a historical epoch before 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.170
 sure with all the travel teleporters 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.120
 over time it could also be maxis ma 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.990
 someone may be more likely to be there 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.920
 other in reality he is controlling 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.990
 in short, everything could be 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.840
 even one of our characters 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.400
 dempsey nicolai type could be 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.030
 nicolai because if you think of the 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.370
 character the new the dead in some 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.680
 contexts says nicolai because I hear 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.720
 still because I always feel this in the 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.260
 my head because it always feels at the moment 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.150
 the collage 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.300
 it could be he who is controlling 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.100
 These zombies are not hypotheses 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.590
 we can have the certainty remains done 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.330
 that this dot in the sky means 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.760
 something because the affair does not put 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.290
 never try this safely 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.360
 he pointed out that the crap did not occur 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:19.160
 see on the map you see only from 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:21.020
 bridge another detail well instead of 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.970
 I would like to point out that surely many 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.310
 of you will already know is the sum 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.730
 hidden where are we going activates 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:32.380
 as you know through the numerical base 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:36.410
 writing the number 9 35 the number 93 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:38.720
 5935 corresponds to the ix35 group and to 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.550
 who did not know the 935 group was group 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.880
 where reithofer worked with 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:46.550
 maxis this can be a detail 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.520
 also quite interesting since 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:53.600
 why 935 why start this 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:55.490
 song with the number 9 35 maybe not with 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.430
 the number 115 because if we write about it 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:01.430
 15 on the display display will just go crazy 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:06.500
 instead with the number 9 35 it will reproduce this 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:09.020
 hidden song certainly remains made 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.490
 trenk will prepare surprises for us 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.650
 coming of us concerns this story 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:15.020
 mob of the dead definitely remembers 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:18.200
 much call of the dead 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:20.959
 indeed certainly the crus of the map 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.100
 zombie black ops 1 where he didn't play 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.730
 but our four characters but 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:28.280
 personified as external characters of the 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.750
 however there were actors on that map 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.940
 always the inter is where we had to 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:35.210
 help our characters to go 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:38.900
 forward in time then on that map 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.940
 there was precisely the strikes with which 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.169
 vamo dialogues precisely with the characters 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.660
 lying behind a door 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:47.690
 steel here instead liszt reg 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:51.410
 it is something apart from respect to the 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:54.260
 our characters we are used to 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:56.240
 a myth adisu black ops 1 then lists 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:59.900
 randy this map has nothing to 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:04.760
 do with them but the fact remains 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:06.890
 that all these little ones small 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.080
 things that the trek is putting in starting 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:12.110
 from that red light from the character that 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.030
 nicolai says in short that he names the name 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.880
 of nikolai surely makes you think of the 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:20.000
 fact that will reveal us and very soon or 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.169
 with the next one with the last dlc really 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.169
 how things went maybe 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:26.150
 will conclude this story depends on what 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:29.980
 they will have in mind to do with the future 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:32.770
 black ops between as raw digos that 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:35.110
 aid that will come out of the wji fiji has not 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.640
 nothing to do I remember with the trenk 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.890
 so it has nothing to do with the 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.110
 zombie story well i hope so of 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:43.390
 not having clarified it maybe we have 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.100
 further messed up the ideas but 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:46.630
 I hope this video is there anyway 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.390
 found a little useful I did 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.780
 maybe a little bit of zombie best is 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.780
 all
