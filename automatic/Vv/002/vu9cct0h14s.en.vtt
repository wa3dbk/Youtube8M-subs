00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.740
 I told a person to welcome you more. 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:27.550
 a video this time I'm here at 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:31.480
 minecraft creative 1.6.1 4 to show 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:34.390
 for you a bug that I did that is not 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.250
 ben bang so a point 6.4 left his 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.460
 blog but before I think not because 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.040
 415 is a bug that allowed people to 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.830
 create a chance for a boss not 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.350
 bauneck is in Portuguese pane here a 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:50.110
 secret chest 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.899
 so you 're here in your normal home 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.970
 returned to the monsters' house and 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:57.160
 when these things take we make craft 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:03.250
 is that who has a little thing in the furnace 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:05.770
 and and put stuff from the chest and logic then 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.340
 This is a personal tip. 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.410
 trunk hidden in your wall and all that 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.220
 you need is these items are in the 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.130
 my hand 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.170
 just this one daycare has it here is 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.149
 logical professional is because I found 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.869
 very good to leave behind the furnace 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:26.200
 because it is well disguised here then the 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:29.500
 People need the case how to get out of here. 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:34.720
 of the items already furnish the item of your 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:39.039
 wall a reston rate a rail 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:41.770
 o'mine kart with a chest issue then 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:44.860
 vote in the senate that you how it works 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.720
 and have no knowledge edson 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.830
 It is only in practice that what is 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.140
 only that 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.090
 so you can see he stays here 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.209
 you can leave like this too 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.860
 but it does not get any better before it gets 

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:58.530
 hidden in the wall essence business 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.509
 black is not giving more then 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.000
 need not have a wall at least 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:07.989
 so three tall and sun put 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.810
 here the three blocks above the floor of the 

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:13.239
 middle bank will put the rail in 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.130
 up the manicardi rail with trunk 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:21.130
 now you want a block from below 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:24.430
 where to put down here 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.860
 under the piston who incidentally just option 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:31.780
 otherwise put the block to hide 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.440
 to the chest and have been active there I stayed 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.020
 a little while 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.810
 so without showing the black part but 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:42.850
 Then he returns to France, complete here. 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:46.750
 O political knack everyone likes the 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:49.270
 wall and it's about that coca touch 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:53.350
 furnace he hid 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:56.740
 Oh my God, my God, animals can 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:59.730
 see that in this corner it is necessary to leave 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:02.350
 Blackest here the furnace will have the 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.250
 chance of you 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:10.030
