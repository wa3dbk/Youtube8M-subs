market<00:00:30.210> now<00:00:30.359> is<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:31.019> fallible<00:00:31.500> yes<00:00:31.800> of<00:00:31.980> course

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
market now is it fallible yes of course

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.639 
market now is it fallible yes of course
all<00:00:32.399> tests<00:00:33.059> are<00:00:33.090> fallible<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.170> some<00:00:34.350> degree

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
all tests are fallible to some degree

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.889 
all tests are fallible to some degree
but<00:00:35.130> this<00:00:35.280> is<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.430> great<00:00:35.700> test<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.210> please<00:00:36.630> talk

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
but this is a great test and please talk

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.270 
but this is a great test and please talk
with<00:00:36.930> your<00:00:37.110> doctor<00:00:37.590> if<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:37.920> have<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:38.100> blood

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
with your doctor if you have a blood

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.490 
with your doctor if you have a blood
sugar<00:00:38.460> issue<00:00:38.730> before<00:00:39.210> doing<00:00:39.360> this<00:00:39.540> test<00:00:39.840> so

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
sugar issue before doing this test so

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.720 
sugar issue before doing this test so
this<00:00:40.649> is<00:00:40.829> called<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.129> glucose<00:00:41.460> tolerance

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
this is called the glucose tolerance

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.150 
this is called the glucose tolerance
test<00:00:43.789> and<00:00:45.320> here's<00:00:46.320> basically<00:00:46.530> how<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.100> works

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
test and here's basically how it works

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.750 
test and here's basically how it works
is<00:00:47.809> you<00:00:48.809> go<00:00:48.989> down<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.469> Walmart<00:00:49.649> or<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.460> local

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
is you go down to Walmart or the local

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.850 
is you go down to Walmart or the local
drugstore<00:00:51.000> pharmacy<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:51.960> pick<00:00:52.170> up<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.440> $20

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
drugstore pharmacy and you pick up a $20

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.830 
drugstore pharmacy and you pick up a $20
glucometer<00:00:53.430> glucometers<00:00:54.300> are<00:00:54.420> used<00:00:54.600> to

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
glucometer glucometers are used to

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.279 
glucometer glucometers are used to
basically<00:00:55.559> put<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.039> very<00:00:56.520> small<00:00:56.930> prick<00:00:57.930> into

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
basically put a very small prick into

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.740 
basically put a very small prick into
your<00:00:58.500> finger<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.910> can<00:01:00.090> extract<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.539> little

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
your finger and you can extract a little

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:01.849 
your finger and you can extract a little
bit<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:00.930> blood<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.379> can<00:01:01.469> measure<00:01:01.649> your

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
bit of blood and it can measure your

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.880 
bit of blood and it can measure your
blood<00:01:01.980> sugar<00:01:02.219> levels<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:03.059> here's<00:01:03.239> what<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.510> do

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
blood sugar levels so here's what you do

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.609 
blood sugar levels so here's what you do
on<00:01:05.060> a<00:01:06.060> day<00:01:06.270> when<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.659> don't<00:01:06.840> have<00:01:06.990> much<00:01:07.290> going

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
on a day when you don't have much going

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.020 
on a day when you don't have much going
on<00:01:07.740> first<00:01:08.130> thing<00:01:08.340> in<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.490> morning<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.000> a

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
on first thing in the morning so a

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.609 
on first thing in the morning so a
weekend<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.659> usually<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:09.990> good<00:01:10.080> day<00:01:10.229> for<00:01:10.290> people

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
weekend is usually a good day for people

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.090 
weekend is usually a good day for people
to<00:01:10.710> do<00:01:10.830> this<00:01:11.150> you<00:01:12.150> take<00:01:12.390> your<00:01:13.100> baseline

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
to do this you take your baseline

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.760 
to do this you take your baseline
glucose<00:01:14.490> level<00:01:15.140> so<00:01:16.140> first<00:01:16.439> thing<00:01:16.619> in<00:01:16.710> the

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
glucose level so first thing in the

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.499 
glucose level so first thing in the
morning<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.130> wake<00:01:17.280> up<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:18.060> don't<00:01:18.270> eat

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
morning you wake up you don't eat

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.359 
morning you wake up you don't eat
anything<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:19.560> can<00:01:19.710> maybe<00:01:19.830> have<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.100> little<00:01:20.310> of

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
anything you can maybe have a little of

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.920 
anything you can maybe have a little of
water<00:01:20.549> if<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:20.939> want<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.479> can<00:01:21.600> brush<00:01:21.780> your

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
water if you want you can brush your

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.050 
water if you want you can brush your
teeth<00:01:22.110> but<00:01:22.409> basically<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.950> wake<00:01:23.130> up<00:01:23.340> you

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
teeth but basically you wake up you

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.550 
teeth but basically you wake up you
don't<00:01:24.270> do<00:01:24.420> any<00:01:24.600> kind<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.900> exercise<00:01:25.020> or

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
don't do any kind of exercise or

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.960 
don't do any kind of exercise or
activity<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.189> don't<00:01:26.310> go<00:01:26.460> out<00:01:26.549> mow<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.759> lawn

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
activity you don't go out mow the lawn

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.700 
activity you don't go out mow the lawn
first<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.420> wake<00:01:27.600> up<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.380> take<00:01:28.530> your

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
first you wake up and you take your

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.620 
first you wake up and you take your
first<00:01:28.920> glucometer<00:01:29.729> test<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.180> find<00:01:30.360> out<00:01:30.509> what

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
first glucometer test to find out what

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.780 
first glucometer test to find out what
your<00:01:30.750> baseline<00:01:31.049> is<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:31.950> let's<00:01:32.130> say<00:01:32.310> somebody

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
your baseline is so let's say somebody

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.490 
your baseline is so let's say somebody
has<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.000> baseline<00:01:33.689> glucose<00:01:34.560> level<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:35.070> about<00:01:35.340> 90

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
has a baseline glucose level of about 90

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.810 
has a baseline glucose level of about 90
then<00:01:37.500> what<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.799> do<00:01:37.950> is<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.340> want<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.549> drink

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
then what you do is you want to drink

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.410 
then what you do is you want to drink
about<00:01:39.140> 75<00:01:40.140> grams<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.860> high<00:01:41.070> glycemic<00:01:41.420> drink

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
about 75 grams of a high glycemic drink

later again so when you add this up this

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.300 
later again so when you add this up this
is<00:02:30.900> an<00:02:31.019> hour<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:32.989> this<00:02:33.989> is<00:02:34.110> another<00:02:34.349> hour<00:02:34.590> so

is an hour and this is another hour so

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.640 
is an hour and this is another hour so
this<00:02:35.430> whole<00:02:35.670> thing<00:02:35.970> will<00:02:36.750> take<00:02:36.930> you<00:02:37.080> two<00:02:37.290> hours

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
this whole thing will take you two hours

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.130 
this whole thing will take you two hours

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
so here's some possibilities as to what

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.509 
so here's some possibilities as to what
you<00:03:09.510> might<00:03:09.690> see<00:03:09.900> again<00:03:10.530> you<00:03:11.010> take<00:03:11.190> your<00:03:11.370> first

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
you might see again you take your first

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:12.920 
you might see again you take your first
baseline<00:03:11.910> when<00:03:12.120> you<00:03:12.180> first<00:03:12.390> wake<00:03:12.599> up<00:03:12.780> you

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
baseline when you first wake up you

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.110 
baseline when you first wake up you
drink<00:03:13.170> a<00:03:13.230> solution<00:03:13.709> 20<00:03:14.489> minutes<00:03:14.730> after<00:03:15.030> that

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
drink a solution 20 minutes after that

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.610 
drink a solution 20 minutes after that
you<00:03:15.359> drink<00:03:15.569> that<00:03:15.720> solution<00:03:16.170> you<00:03:16.230> take<00:03:16.410> another

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
you drink that solution you take another

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.409 
you drink that solution you take another
blood<00:03:16.859> sugar<00:03:17.099> reading<00:03:17.340> 20<00:03:17.940> minutes<00:03:18.299> after

blood sugar reading 20 minutes after

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:20.690 
blood sugar reading 20 minutes after
this<00:03:18.750> you<00:03:18.930> take<00:03:19.049> another<00:03:19.319> 120<00:03:20.190> minutes<00:03:20.459> again

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
this you take another 120 minutes again

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.670 
this you take another 120 minutes again
30<00:03:21.150> minutes<00:03:21.450> later<00:03:21.630> in<00:03:21.870> 30<00:03:22.169> minutes<00:03:22.470> later

30 minutes later in 30 minutes later

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.390 
30 minutes later in 30 minutes later
then<00:03:23.430> you<00:03:23.970> can<00:03:24.690> plot<00:03:24.959> your<00:03:25.169> results<00:03:25.590> and<00:03:26.220> here

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
then you can plot your results and here

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.449 
then you can plot your results and here
are<00:03:26.489> some<00:03:26.609> things<00:03:26.819> that<00:03:26.970> you<00:03:27.060> might<00:03:27.209> see<00:03:27.269> now

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
are some things that you might see now

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.259 
are some things that you might see now
and<00:03:29.459> normal<00:03:29.940> healthy<00:03:30.209> glucose<00:03:30.620> let's<00:03:31.620> say

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
and normal healthy glucose let's say

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.390 
and normal healthy glucose let's say
healthy<00:03:33.269> upper<00:03:33.660> end<00:03:33.840> is<00:03:34.079> a<00:03:34.109> hundred<00:03:34.410> a<00:03:34.650> healthy

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
healthy upper end is a hundred a healthy

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.379 
healthy upper end is a hundred a healthy
lower<00:03:35.609> end<00:03:35.910> is<00:03:36.209> a<00:03:36.480> tea<00:03:36.599> and<00:03:37.700> of<00:03:38.700> course<00:03:38.940> too

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
lower end is a tea and of course too

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:41.330 
lower end is a tea and of course too
high<00:03:39.569> might<00:03:39.840> be<00:03:39.989> something<00:03:40.380> like<00:03:40.410> 200<00:03:41.010> and<00:03:41.160> too

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
high might be something like 200 and too

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.759 
high might be something like 200 and too
low<00:03:41.549> might<00:03:41.760> be<00:03:41.910> something<00:03:42.269> like<00:03:42.299> 60<00:03:42.900> okay<00:03:43.709> so

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
low might be something like 60 okay so

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.620 
low might be something like 60 okay so
we'll<00:03:44.099> talk<00:03:44.310> first<00:03:44.609> about<00:03:44.790> what<00:03:44.970> you<00:03:45.329> might

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
we'll talk first about what you might

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.890 
we'll talk first about what you might
see<00:03:46.109> in<00:03:46.290> a<00:03:46.410> normal<00:03:46.950> blood<00:03:47.519> sugar<00:03:47.760> response<00:03:47.970> so

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
see in a normal blood sugar response so

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.750 
see in a normal blood sugar response so
let's<00:03:49.109> say<00:03:49.290> your<00:03:49.500> initial<00:03:49.980> response<00:03:50.130> in<00:03:50.669> the

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
let's say your initial response in the

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.659 
let's say your initial response in the
first<00:03:51.260> glucose<00:03:52.260> level<00:03:52.829> so<00:03:53.010> will<00:03:53.160> by<00:03:53.459> the<00:03:53.519> way

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:53.669 
first glucose level so will by the way

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:56.089 
first glucose level so will by the way
to<00:03:53.730> 20<00:03:54.090> minutes<00:03:54.359> 40<00:03:54.720> minutes<00:03:54.750> 60<00:03:55.410> minutes<00:03:55.440> 90

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
to 20 minutes 40 minutes 60 minutes 90

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.699 
to 20 minutes 40 minutes 60 minutes 90
minutes<00:03:56.370> on<00:03:56.430> 120<00:03:57.180> minutes<00:03:57.419> so<00:03:58.079> your<00:03:58.260> first<00:03:58.500> one

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
minutes on 120 minutes so your first one

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.129 
minutes on 120 minutes so your first one
was<00:03:58.739> at<00:03:58.980> 90<00:03:59.310> let's<00:03:59.879> say<00:04:00.060> at<00:04:00.329> 20<00:04:00.750> minutes<00:04:00.900> you

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:01.139 
was at 90 let's say at 20 minutes you

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:03.860 
was at 90 let's say at 20 minutes you
were<00:04:01.230> around<00:04:01.440> 120<00:04:02.220> at<00:04:02.459> 40<00:04:03.299> minutes<00:04:03.599> you<00:04:03.720> might

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
were around 120 at 40 minutes you might

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.830 
were around 120 at 40 minutes you might
have<00:04:03.989> been<00:04:04.139> around<00:04:04.379> 110<00:04:05.310> at<00:04:05.579> 60<00:04:06.480> minutes<00:04:06.629> you

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
have been around 110 at 60 minutes you

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.180 
have been around 110 at 60 minutes you
might<00:04:07.049> have<00:04:07.169> been<00:04:07.290> down<00:04:07.470> around<00:04:07.769> a<00:04:07.829> hundred

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
might have been down around a hundred

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.550 
might have been down around a hundred
ninety<00:04:08.790> minutes<00:04:09.269> about<00:04:09.750> maybe<00:04:10.139> 95<00:04:10.829> and<00:04:11.540> after

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
ninety minutes about maybe 95 and after

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.020 
ninety minutes about maybe 95 and after
two<00:04:13.560> hours<00:04:13.739> you're<00:04:13.949> back<00:04:14.459> down<00:04:14.669> to<00:04:14.910> your

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
two hours you're back down to your

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.120 
two hours you're back down to your
original<00:04:15.150> starting<00:04:15.750> point<00:04:15.959> so<00:04:16.169> this<00:04:16.919> would<00:04:17.039> be

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
original starting point so this would be

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.460 
original starting point so this would be
a<00:04:17.160> fairly<00:04:17.729> normal<00:04:18.359> blood<00:04:18.690> sugar<00:04:18.750> curve<00:04:19.260> or

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
a fairly normal blood sugar curve or

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.649 
a fairly normal blood sugar curve or
blood<00:04:19.620> sugar<00:04:19.829> response<00:04:20.039> or<00:04:20.789> insulin<00:04:21.299> response

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:21.659 
blood sugar response or insulin response

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:24.920 
blood sugar response or insulin response
to<00:04:22.019> that<00:04:22.380> 75<00:04:22.979> gram<00:04:23.310> of<00:04:23.520> glucose<00:04:23.820> load<00:04:24.090> now<00:04:24.630> some

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
to that 75 gram of glucose load now some

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:25.820 
to that 75 gram of glucose load now some
people<00:04:25.050> might<00:04:25.289> suggest

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
people might suggest

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:26.990 
people might suggest
that<00:04:25.949> this<00:04:26.099> would<00:04:26.310> go<00:04:26.430> down<00:04:26.610> a<00:04:26.639> little<00:04:26.879> bit

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
that this would go down a little bit

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.089 
that this would go down a little bit
more<00:04:27.180> quickly<00:04:27.360> and<00:04:27.720> kind<00:04:28.289> of<00:04:28.349> level<00:04:28.620> out<00:04:28.770> but

00:04:29.089 --> 00:04:29.099 
more quickly and kind of level out but

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:30.679 
more quickly and kind of level out but
the<00:04:29.250> point<00:04:29.490> is<00:04:29.610> is<00:04:29.819> it<00:04:29.939> doesn't<00:04:30.330> go<00:04:30.419> up<00:04:30.449> too

00:04:30.679 --> 00:04:30.689 
the point is is it doesn't go up too

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:32.990 
the point is is it doesn't go up too
high<00:04:30.870> it<00:04:31.530> doesn't<00:04:31.949> drop<00:04:32.069> down<00:04:32.280> too<00:04:32.490> low<00:04:32.699> and

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
high it doesn't drop down too low and

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.409 
high it doesn't drop down too low and
that<00:04:33.030> you<00:04:33.870> end<00:04:34.139> where<00:04:34.500> you<00:04:34.650> started<00:04:35.039> from

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
that you end where you started from

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:37.879 
that you end where you started from
now<00:04:36.419> here's<00:04:36.750> another<00:04:36.810> response<00:04:37.439> if<00:04:37.620> you<00:04:37.710> have

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
now here's another response if you have

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:40.249 
now here's another response if you have
hypoglycemic<00:04:38.819> tendencies<00:04:39.330> and<00:04:39.539> this<00:04:40.050> is

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:40.259 
hypoglycemic tendencies and this is

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:42.170 
hypoglycemic tendencies and this is
early<00:04:40.500> insulin<00:04:41.159> resistance<00:04:41.610> very<00:04:41.819> often<00:04:42.120> to

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
early insulin resistance very often to

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.939 
early insulin resistance very often to
be<00:04:42.300> honest<00:04:42.539> with<00:04:42.629> you<00:04:42.750> let's<00:04:43.379> say<00:04:43.560> this

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:43.949 
be honest with you let's say this

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:45.890 
be honest with you let's say this
individual<00:04:44.550> also<00:04:44.759> had<00:04:45.150> an<00:04:45.360> initial<00:04:45.750> blood

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
individual also had an initial blood

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.070 
individual also had an initial blood
sugar<00:04:46.110> of<00:04:46.289> 90<00:04:46.590> but<00:04:47.400> after<00:04:47.939> 20<00:04:48.300> minutes<00:04:48.599> they

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
sugar of 90 but after 20 minutes they

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.770 
sugar of 90 but after 20 minutes they
spiked<00:04:49.439> up<00:04:49.650> to<00:04:49.860> let's<00:04:50.340> say<00:04:50.490> around<00:04:50.610> 180<00:04:51.509> and

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
spiked up to let's say around 180 and

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.490 
spiked up to let's say around 180 and
then<00:04:52.560> after<00:04:53.009> 20<00:04:53.879> minutes<00:04:54.180> around<00:04:54.479> 40<00:04:55.199> minutes

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
then after 20 minutes around 40 minutes

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.050 
then after 20 minutes around 40 minutes
maybe<00:04:55.680> they<00:04:55.830> drop<00:04:56.069> down<00:04:56.250> back<00:04:56.550> to<00:04:56.580> around

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
maybe they drop down back to around

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.300 
maybe they drop down back to around
let's<00:04:57.330> say<00:04:57.419> a<00:04:57.449> hundred<00:04:57.840> and<00:04:57.990> then<00:04:58.020> after<00:04:58.889> sixty

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
let's say a hundred and then after sixty

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.369 
let's say a hundred and then after sixty
minutes<00:04:59.610> they<00:04:59.729> are<00:04:59.759> down<00:04:59.940> to<00:05:00.090> 80<00:05:00.300> 90<00:05:01.110> minutes

00:05:01.369 --> 00:05:01.379 
minutes they are down to 80 90 minutes

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:03.800 
minutes they are down to 80 90 minutes
maybe<00:05:01.590> down<00:05:01.770> to<00:05:01.800> 60<00:05:02.340> and<00:05:02.550> then<00:05:02.879> 120<00:05:03.539> minutes

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
maybe down to 60 and then 120 minutes

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.209 
maybe down to 60 and then 120 minutes
maybe<00:05:04.020> they<00:05:04.199> rose<00:05:04.379> up<00:05:04.409> and<00:05:04.830> they're<00:05:04.949> a<00:05:04.979> little

00:05:05.209 --> 00:05:05.219 
maybe they rose up and they're a little

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:09.189 
maybe they rose up and they're a little
bit<00:05:05.310> high<00:05:05.460> so<00:05:06.270> this<00:05:07.229> would<00:05:07.469> be<00:05:07.590> a<00:05:07.639> typical

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:09.199 
bit high so this would be a typical

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:11.480 
bit high so this would be a typical
response<00:05:10.199> in<00:05:10.379> somebody<00:05:10.650> that<00:05:10.680> hypoglycemic

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
response in somebody that hypoglycemic

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.550 
response in somebody that hypoglycemic
tendencies<00:05:11.909> now<00:05:12.389> hypoglycemic<00:05:13.169> tendencies

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
tendencies now hypoglycemic tendencies

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.770 
tendencies now hypoglycemic tendencies
what<00:05:13.770> this<00:05:13.919> is<00:05:14.069> really<00:05:14.190> saying<00:05:14.310> is<00:05:14.789> you<00:05:15.000> have

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
what this is really saying is you have

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.230 
what this is really saying is you have
normal<00:05:15.990> fasting<00:05:16.530> blood<00:05:16.650> sugar<00:05:16.949> but<00:05:17.610> then<00:05:17.849> your

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
normal fasting blood sugar but then your

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.089 
normal fasting blood sugar but then your
body<00:05:18.539> responds<00:05:19.020> and<00:05:19.199> you<00:05:19.289> get<00:05:19.409> too<00:05:19.590> much<00:05:19.770> blood

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:20.099 
body responds and you get too much blood

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:21.920 
body responds and you get too much blood
sugar<00:05:20.279> into<00:05:20.520> your<00:05:20.550> bloodstream<00:05:20.819> your<00:05:21.690> body

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
sugar into your bloodstream your body

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.100 
sugar into your bloodstream your body
responds<00:05:22.650> really<00:05:23.039> well<00:05:23.490> in<00:05:23.789> fact<00:05:24.389> it<00:05:24.599> produces

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
responds really well in fact it produces

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.260 
responds really well in fact it produces
too<00:05:25.379> much<00:05:25.409> insulin<00:05:26.279> and<00:05:26.550> that<00:05:26.759> that's<00:05:27.000> why

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
too much insulin and that that's why

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.029 
too much insulin and that that's why
this<00:05:27.330> is<00:05:27.629> referred<00:05:27.960> to<00:05:27.990> as<00:05:28.110> early<00:05:28.439> insulin

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 
this is referred to as early insulin

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:31.159 
this is referred to as early insulin
resistance<00:05:29.520> if<00:05:29.789> you<00:05:30.150> get<00:05:30.300> too<00:05:30.539> much<00:05:30.719> insulin

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
resistance if you get too much insulin

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:32.659 
resistance if you get too much insulin
it<00:05:31.379> will<00:05:31.469> drive<00:05:31.710> your<00:05:31.860> blood<00:05:32.039> sugar<00:05:32.279> down<00:05:32.400> too

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
it will drive your blood sugar down too

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:34.790 
it will drive your blood sugar down too
low<00:05:32.879> which<00:05:33.419> becomes<00:05:33.779> an<00:05:33.930> emergency<00:05:34.139> for<00:05:34.620> your

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
low which becomes an emergency for your

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.379 
low which becomes an emergency for your
brain<00:05:35.009> and<00:05:35.250> then<00:05:35.729> your<00:05:35.849> body<00:05:36.029> will<00:05:36.120> release

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:36.389 
brain and then your body will release

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:38.269 
brain and then your body will release
other<00:05:36.659> hormones<00:05:37.229> to<00:05:37.349> try<00:05:37.529> to<00:05:37.590> get<00:05:37.770> blood<00:05:38.069> sugar

00:05:38.269 --> 00:05:38.279 
other hormones to try to get blood sugar

back<00:05:38.490> up<00:05:38.520> this<00:05:39.389> tendency<00:05:39.930> is<00:05:40.159> like<00:05:41.159> I<00:05:41.279> said

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
back up this tendency is like I said

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.040 
back up this tendency is like I said
mostly<00:05:41.819> hypoglycemic<00:05:42.509> tendency<00:05:42.839> and

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
mostly hypoglycemic tendency and

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.329 
mostly hypoglycemic tendency and
considered<00:05:43.409> be<00:05:43.529> considered<00:05:43.889> to<00:05:43.949> be<00:05:44.039> early

00:05:44.329 --> 00:05:44.339

considered be considered to be early
insulin<00:05:44.759> resistance<00:05:45.180> let's<00:05:45.839> talk<00:05:46.020> about<00:05:46.139> a

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:46.259 
insulin resistance let's talk about a

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:48.740 
insulin resistance let's talk about a
last<00:05:46.500> possibility<00:05:47.089> somebody<00:05:48.089> again<00:05:48.360> starts

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
last possibility somebody again starts

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.809 
last possibility somebody again starts
with<00:05:48.900> a<00:05:48.930> baseline<00:05:49.289> of<00:05:49.529> 90<00:05:49.830> but<00:05:50.339> let's<00:05:50.520> say<00:05:50.639> they

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:50.819 
with a baseline of 90 but let's say they

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:52.879 
with a baseline of 90 but let's say they
jump<00:05:51.089> up<00:05:51.210> to<00:05:51.360> maybe<00:05:51.479> 200<00:05:52.050> at<00:05:52.139> 20<00:05:52.440> minutes<00:05:52.710> and

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:52.889 
jump up to maybe 200 at 20 minutes and

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:56.510 
jump up to maybe 200 at 20 minutes and
at<00:05:53.669> 40<00:05:54.000> minutes<00:05:54.270> they're<00:05:54.419> about<00:05:54.629> 180<00:05:55.110> and<00:05:55.520> 160

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 
at 40 minutes they're about 180 and 160

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.610 
at 40 minutes they're about 180 and 160
or<00:05:56.550> 60<00:05:57.300> minutes<00:05:57.569> they're<00:05:57.750> sort<00:05:58.229> of<00:05:58.319> dropping

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
or 60 minutes they're sort of dropping

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.649 
or 60 minutes they're sort of dropping
down<00:05:58.949> and<00:05:59.279> they<00:05:59.610> never<00:05:59.729> really<00:06:00.150> even<00:06:00.300> return

00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:00.659 
down and they never really even return

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:03.320 
down and they never really even return
to<00:06:00.779> baseline<00:06:01.139> at<00:06:01.529> the<00:06:01.979> end<00:06:02.129> this<00:06:02.789> would<00:06:02.849> be<00:06:03.300> a

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
to baseline at the end this would be a

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.420 
to baseline at the end this would be a
classic<00:06:03.659> insulin<00:06:04.289> resistant<00:06:04.800> type<00:06:05.009> patient

blood<00:06:07.770> sugar<00:06:08.009> goes<00:06:08.190> up<00:06:08.400> too<00:06:08.580> high<00:06:08.789> based<00:06:09.089> on

blood sugar goes up too high based on
that<00:06:09.419> load<00:06:09.629> and<00:06:09.810> insulin<00:06:10.650> is<00:06:10.830> not<00:06:11.159> adequate

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:11.669 
that load and insulin is not adequate

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:12.980 
that load and insulin is not adequate
enough<00:06:11.729> to<00:06:11.940> actually<00:06:12.180> get<00:06:12.539> it<00:06:12.659> into<00:06:12.779> the

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:12.990 
enough to actually get it into the

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.519 
enough to actually get it into the

00:06:13.519 --> 00:06:13.529 
system

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:15.439

maybe<00:06:14.069> they<00:06:14.279> lack<00:06:14.490> insulin<00:06:15.000> maybe<00:06:15.270> the

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:15.449 
maybe they lack insulin maybe the

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:17.059 
maybe they lack insulin maybe the
insulin<00:06:15.779> receptors<00:06:16.229> aren't<00:06:16.469> working<00:06:16.740> but<00:06:16.770> for

insulin receptors aren't working but for

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:18.499 
insulin receptors aren't working but for
some<00:06:17.219> reason<00:06:17.550> they're<00:06:17.669> not<00:06:17.699> getting<00:06:18.150> glucose

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:18.509 
some reason they're not getting glucose

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:20.689 
some reason they're not getting glucose
out<00:06:18.990> of<00:06:19.259> their<00:06:19.349> bloodstream<00:06:19.740> and<00:06:19.979> into<00:06:20.580> the

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:20.699 
out of their bloodstream and into the
