 install a rom that I love is 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:29.340
 a weak action reaction but this 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:31.290
 442 time is an android the last android 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.930
 what is there and is for the versions of 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.239
 samsung galaxy s 1 and osasuna the 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.670
 initiated like this and for that is a 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.730
 galaxy s3 I was in that nothing is going to 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.530
 bring these a galaxy s2 and as always 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.750
 is the description you will have the downloads 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.170
 to download the files you have to 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.950
 download it google apps the rom and the club 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.490
 we have advanced 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:57.550
 I have come a rom 412 you will need 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:01.630
 install the advanced globule but if you already 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:03.670
 come from 14 22 14 42 decisions in mos 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.909
 no need to install this clockwork 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.469
 mod 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.119
 Well , first of all, we're going to 

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:09.950
 start the lower moon recovery that is 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.479
 pressing up 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.479
 home and power for a few seconds 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.820
 I will be able to release and the finish starts 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.190
 the recovery mix 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.380
 I'm not going to teach to install what is 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.440
 the voice the first thing you have to do is 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.050
 make a wave datafactory button set 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.350
 power and go down with the volume key 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.800
 up or down the alcor be data and 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.810
 start him 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:49.140
 now the data from the previous 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:53.850
 and this this is going to give wayne cache 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:57.290
 partition let's go again cache 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.290
 I 'm going there, advance 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:05.540
 wilde as now we will go back 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.899
 once the admin white cache is done 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.729
 it's an option and it's the zip and here is 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.350
 where we have to have our file 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.840
 hosted 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.880
 on the external sd card very in the 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.370
 internal I always recommend that the 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.680
 metal on the outside to have it always 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.900
 more on hand in case you erase them but the 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.600
 web cache let's give it here in the 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.720
 first option 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:32.070
 and I have that it has android kitkat already 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.720
 I said before that if I came for a romantic 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.920
 4228442 you do not need this step there 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.250
 to install the club or the mode 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.370
 compatible that you have at all but if 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.430
 you come from 1412 and you'll have to do it 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:48.430
 how am I going to install in the lower 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.200
 recovery and once installed we will 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:55.200
 go and go back 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.200
 and advanced network recovery 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.630
 it's a copper decision in advanced 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.030
 to be able to install the 442 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.730
 who want a club one of the most 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:10.370
 advanced 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.370
 a new record is the same 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.889
 and we look where it says according to the dea 

00:03:12.999 --> 00:03:18.270
 wet in the internal or external 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:20.700
 Extenda is that carbon 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.370
 when they take him 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.750
 and we installed what rice first is 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.819
 an action game 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:32.170
 version 5 we give it and we will give 10 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.170
 stations a remix 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.280
 you have finished installing what now 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.140
 we're going to be in the google apps is the 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.630
 same android procedure you are looking for 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.010
 a folder where it's hosted and we're going 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.489
 here in the google apps option 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.849
 and it's being google apps late nothing for the 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.849
 same 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.269
 google apps 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.020
 well once finished on this side of 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.530
 what is gluttony we also love a 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.690
 long back 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.870
 and finally that the first option that 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.720
 says the external rebound or 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:15.550
 that did not start anything in the terminal 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:19.420
 and is the 44 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:22.120
 in the stock version are slight 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:25.840
 as it will always take the beginning of the 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:28.420
 four- minute round for four 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.210
 minutes late to start pain of not 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:33.520
 change here the logo the imation button a 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.280
 reflection of him 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.789
 Well then I decide what to give it here 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.229
 see how the interface based on the 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:43.390
 keel juste let's see what is a 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:47.180
 version of 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:49.630
 442 Android phone function 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:54.120
 also that is 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.120
 and how you must android 442 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.080
 there are also many options for 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.050
 personalization like for example here in 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:04.320
 the selection tool 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:09.580
 that brings a lot 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:11.080
 the interface we're going to hit the button 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.240
 active navigation in the bar 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.639
 navigation as a problem here you can 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.340
 choose the buttons you want and here the 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:19.680
 if you 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.040
 we can activate in what is the bar 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.940
 navigation 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:28.960
 or deactivated according to you too 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.960
 It has enough 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:35.010
 with functions like milestone what can 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.010
 Activate 

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:42.179
 the good thing about everything that you can go looking 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:44.399
 to you is against the proceedings is 

00:05:42.179 --> 00:05:46.639
 via ota the pressure that pressure here 

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:46.639
 above 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:52.150
 nothing is going very well say that the 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.380
 superfluity works quite well 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.380
 all in one camera 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:58.389
 test 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:02.599
 very big 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:09.490
 and well nothing more to tell you that has 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:11.560
 liked the tutorial that I had light 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.479
 description of the video as always all 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:17.229

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:19.620
 comment and below and nothing more than up 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:19.620
