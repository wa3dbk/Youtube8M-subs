snapchat 14 w 18 a and I made a design
yesterday<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.510> can<00:00:27.900> see<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.320> here<00:00:28.830> we<00:00:29.070> can

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
here press either of the buttons for

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.970 
here press either of the buttons for
example<00:00:34.770> this<00:00:35.010> one<00:00:35.600> we<00:00:36.600> are<00:00:36.660> going<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:37.200> go<00:00:37.710> up

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
example this one we are going to go up

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.479 
example this one we are going to go up
and<00:00:38.360> here<00:00:39.360> we<00:00:39.390> are<00:00:39.540> at<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.020> top<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:41.340> go

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
and here we are at the top and to go

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.180 
and here we are at the top and to go
down<00:00:41.760> we<00:00:42.090> just<00:00:42.450> jump<00:00:43.200> down<00:00:43.440> we<00:00:43.770> can<00:00:43.920> hold

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
down we just jump down we can hold

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.220 
down we just jump down we can hold
spacebar<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.300> prevent<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.989> player<00:00:46.170> from

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
spacebar to prevent the player from

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.690 
spacebar to prevent the player from
bouncing<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.390> here<00:00:48.390> we<00:00:48.510> are<00:00:49.129> so<00:00:50.129> there's<00:00:50.430> an

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
bouncing and here we are so there's an

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.880 
bouncing and here we are so there's an
issue<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:51.090> this<00:00:51.300> elevator<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.840> it's<00:00:52.469> not<00:00:52.649> very

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
issue of this elevator and it's not very

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.639 
issue of this elevator and it's not very
reliable<00:00:53.129> so<00:00:54.120> yeah<00:00:54.270> it's<00:00:54.390> fast<00:00:54.719> but<00:00:55.410> not

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
reliable so yeah it's fast but not

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.590 
reliable so yeah it's fast but not
reliable<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.430> yeah<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.239> might<00:00:57.420> be<00:00:57.570> a

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
reliable and yeah that might be a

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.930 
reliable and yeah that might be a
problem<00:00:57.899> for<00:00:58.289> example<00:00:59.219> if<00:00:59.370> you're<00:00:59.550> wagging

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
problem for example if you're wagging

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.119 
problem for example if you're wagging
then<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.510> elevator<00:01:00.780> might<00:01:01.109> not<00:01:01.289> work<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.829> if

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
then the elevator might not work and if

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.009 
then the elevator might not work and if
the<00:01:02.280> server's<00:01:02.609> wagging<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.480> might<00:01:03.809> not<00:01:03.989> work

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
the server's wagging it might not work

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.859 
the server's wagging it might not work
either<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:04.890> keep<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.610> in<00:01:05.760> mind<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.299> nice

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
either so keep that in mind and nice

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.460 
either so keep that in mind and nice
move<00:01:07.140> on<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.560> tutorial<00:01:08.780> so<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:10.049> elevator

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
move on to the tutorial so the elevator

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.130 
move on to the tutorial so the elevator
has<00:01:10.860> three<00:01:11.340> parts<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.659> first<00:01:12.900> part

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
has three parts to it so the first part

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.130 
has three parts to it so the first part
is<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.470> launcher<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:15.000> second<00:01:15.390> part<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:15.840> the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
is the launcher the second part is the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.859 
is the launcher the second part is the
elevator<00:01:16.650> itself<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:18.030> third<00:01:18.299> part<00:01:18.630> is

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
elevator itself and the third part is

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.679 
elevator itself and the third part is
the<00:01:18.960> catcher<00:01:19.850> so<00:01:20.850> let's<00:01:21.150> start<00:01:21.420> with<00:01:21.570> the

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
the catcher so let's start with the

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.649 
the catcher so let's start with the
launcher<00:01:22.170> first<00:01:23.119> so<00:01:24.119> what<00:01:24.270> you're<00:01:24.360> going<00:01:24.540> to

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
launcher first so what you're going to

alright<00:02:15.930> so<00:02:16.320> for<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.680> next<00:02:16.770> part<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:17.340> want<00:02:17.490> to

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
alright so for the next part you want to

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.830 
alright so for the next part you want to
count<00:02:18.030> three<00:02:18.480> blocks<00:02:18.780> so<00:02:19.320> 1<00:02:19.560> 2<00:02:19.950> 3<00:02:20.570> place<00:02:21.570> a

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
count three blocks so 1 2 3 place a

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.770 
count three blocks so 1 2 3 place a
sticky<00:02:22.200> piston<00:02:22.500> here<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.130> walk<00:02:23.580> here<00:02:24.090> sticky

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
sticky piston here and walk here sticky

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.200 
sticky piston here and walk here sticky
piston<00:02:25.170> remove<00:02:25.560> this<00:02:25.710> block<00:02:25.920> placed<00:02:26.820> a<00:02:26.940> swim

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
piston remove this block placed a swim

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.900 
piston remove this block placed a swim
walk<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.810> now<00:02:28.410> place<00:02:28.770> two<00:02:29.070> blocks<00:02:29.370> like<00:02:29.700> this

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
walk and now place two blocks like this

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.080 
walk and now place two blocks like this
repeater<00:02:30.630> on<00:02:30.750> two<00:02:31.200> chicks<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:31.950> now<00:02:32.400> go<00:02:32.700> under

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
repeater on two chicks and now go under

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.850 
repeater on two chicks and now go under
the<00:02:33.240> piston<00:02:33.540> here<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.080> what<00:02:34.380> you<00:02:34.470> want<00:02:34.590> to<00:02:34.620> do

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
the piston here and what you want to do

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.700 
the piston here and what you want to do
is<00:02:35.040> place<00:02:35.310> a<00:02:35.340> tripwire<00:02:35.730> hook<00:02:36.150> here<00:02:36.630> place<00:02:37.410> to

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
is place a tripwire hook here place to

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.680 
is place a tripwire hook here place to
string<00:02:38.010> like<00:02:38.220> this<00:02:38.360> walk<00:02:39.360> here<00:02:39.980> tripwire<00:02:40.980> hook

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
string like this walk here tripwire hook

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.710 
string like this walk here tripwire hook
now<00:02:42.690> here<00:02:43.080> you<00:02:43.260> want<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.530> place<00:02:43.980> my<00:02:44.400> own<00:02:45.120> box<00:02:45.450> or

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
now here you want to place my own box or

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.990 
now here you want to place my own box or
furnaces<00:02:46.410> or<00:02:46.620> obsidian<00:02:47.160> basically<00:02:47.760> books

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
furnaces or obsidian basically books

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.870 
furnaces or obsidian basically books
that<00:02:48.209> aren't<00:02:48.390> possible<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:49.320> our<00:02:49.560> full<00:02:50.370> solid

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
that aren't possible and our full solid

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.840 
that aren't possible and our full solid
box<00:02:51.920> so<00:02:52.920> they're<00:02:53.160> going<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.430> make<00:02:53.670> the

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
box so they're going to make the

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.990 
box so they're going to make the
elevator<00:02:54.030> more<00:02:54.450> reliable<00:02:55.340> alright<00:02:56.370> and<00:02:56.610> next

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
elevator more reliable alright and next

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.380 
elevator more reliable alright and next
step<00:02:57.240> you<00:02:57.360> wants<00:02:57.540> to<00:02:57.600> just<00:02:58.050> connect<00:02:58.560> this<00:02:58.800> here

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
step you wants to just connect this here

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:07.160 
step you wants to just connect this here
like<00:03:00.390> this<00:03:00.600> and<00:03:03.200> you<00:03:04.790> might<00:03:05.790> want<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.180> place<00:03:06.480> my

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
like this and you might want to place my

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.050 
like this and you might want to place my
own<00:03:07.200> box<00:03:07.440> here<00:03:07.830> as<00:03:07.920> well<00:03:08.220> to<00:03:08.580> make<00:03:08.670> it<00:03:08.880> more

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
own box here as well to make it more

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.720 
own box here as well to make it more
reliable<00:03:09.510> as<00:03:09.959> a<00:03:09.990> set<00:03:10.320> earlier<00:03:10.740> or<00:03:10.980> actually

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
reliable as a set earlier or actually

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.890 
reliable as a set earlier or actually
just<00:03:11.940> now<00:03:12.150> and<00:03:12.590> here<00:03:13.590> you<00:03:13.650> have<00:03:13.830> it<00:03:13.860> so<00:03:14.519> yet<00:03:15.060> now

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
just now and here you have it so yet now

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.350 
just now and here you have it so yet now
you<00:03:15.959> can<00:03:16.230> actually<00:03:16.440> just<00:03:17.160> count<00:03:17.640> four<00:03:18.060> blocks

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
you can actually just count four blocks

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.490 
you can actually just count four blocks
so<00:03:18.840> take<00:03:19.140> it<00:03:19.260> a<00:03:19.350> little<00:03:19.440> bit<00:03:19.650> higher<00:03:20.519> and<00:03:21.500> let's

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
so take it a little bit higher and let's

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.530 
so take it a little bit higher and let's
do<00:03:22.680> that<00:03:22.830> so<00:03:23.340> we're<00:03:23.519> going<00:03:23.670> to<00:03:23.820> count<00:03:24.209> four

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
do that so we're going to count four

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.540 
do that so we're going to count four
blocks<00:03:24.780> so<00:03:25.200> 1<00:03:25.440> 2<00:03:25.950> 3<00:03:25.980> 4<00:03:27.170> 6<00:03:28.170> piston<00:03:28.440> get<00:03:29.310> rid<00:03:29.430> of

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
blocks so 1 2 3 4 6 piston get rid of

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.680 
blocks so 1 2 3 4 6 piston get rid of
this<00:03:31.190> again<00:03:32.190> an<00:03:32.340> hour<00:03:32.430> sticky<00:03:32.790> piston<00:03:33.209> so<00:03:33.600> I'm

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
this again an hour sticky piston so I'm

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.490 
this again an hour sticky piston so I'm
walk<00:03:34.040> to<00:03:35.040> box<00:03:35.280> like<00:03:35.519> this<00:03:36.140> repeater<00:03:37.140> on<00:03:37.230> two

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
walk to box like this repeater on two

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:46.040 
walk to box like this repeater on two
chicks<00:03:40.580> now<00:03:41.600> go<00:03:42.600> here<00:03:43.670> which<00:03:44.670> by<00:03:44.970> hook<00:03:45.269> string

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
chicks now go here which by hook string

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:52.759 
chicks now go here which by hook string
one<00:03:46.739> to<00:03:47.450> walk<00:03:48.450> here<00:03:49.010> tripwire<00:03:50.010> hook<00:03:51.530> rest<00:03:52.530> on

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
one to walk here tripwire hook rest on

00:03:52.769 --> 00:04:01.420 
one to walk here tripwire hook rest on
this<00:03:52.920> here<00:03:54.920> and<00:03:57.050> mount<00:03:58.050> box<00:03:58.350> here<00:03:58.800> like<00:03:59.580> this

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
this here and mount box here like this

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.770

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.159 
this design and as I said earlier it is
not<00:05:10.460> very<00:05:11.360> reliable

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
not very reliable

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:16.060 
not very reliable
like<00:05:12.919> you<00:05:13.190> can<00:05:13.340> use<00:05:13.520> it<00:05:13.550> but<00:05:14.240> I<00:05:14.830> don't<00:05:15.830> really

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
like you can use it but I don't really

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.920 
like you can use it but I don't really
recommend<00:05:16.280> using<00:05:16.700> it<00:05:16.910> if<00:05:17.090> you<00:05:17.210> have<00:05:17.450> a<00:05:17.630> bad

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
recommend using it if you have a bad

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.110 
recommend using it if you have a bad
computer<00:05:18.320> or<00:05:18.800> if<00:05:19.190> the<00:05:19.310> server<00:05:19.520> you're<00:05:19.820> prank

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
computer or if the server you're prank

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.890 
computer or if the server you're prank
on<00:05:20.330> is<00:05:20.480> faggy

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
on is faggy

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.250 
on is faggy
but<00:05:21.770> if<00:05:21.979> once<00:05:22.160> make<00:05:22.400> it<00:05:22.490> more<00:05:22.610> reliable<00:05:23.260> just

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260 
but if once make it more reliable just

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.830 
but if once make it more reliable just
place<00:05:24.560> more<00:05:24.919> box<00:05:25.340> around<00:05:25.580> it<00:05:25.820> and<00:05:26.000> just<00:05:26.419> encase

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
place more box around it and just encase

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.460 
place more box around it and just encase
it<00:05:26.870> like<00:05:27.860> this<00:05:28.070> and<00:05:29.050> that<00:05:30.050> should<00:05:30.229> make<00:05:30.290> it

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
it like this and that should make it

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.600 
it like this and that should make it
work<00:05:30.979> most<00:05:31.460> of<00:05:31.610> the<00:05:31.700> time<00:05:32.020> and<00:05:33.020> yes<00:05:33.919> so<00:05:34.280> that's
