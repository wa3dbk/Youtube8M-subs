00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.020 
well I don't know I haven't opened it
yet<00:02:34.960> but<00:02:35.500> I<00:02:35.710> got<00:02:35.950> feeling<00:02:36.610> it<00:02:36.850> is<00:02:37.570> to<00:02:38.760> take<00:02:39.760> out

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
yet but I got feeling it is to take out

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:46.380 
yet but I got feeling it is to take out
debris<00:02:40.650> let<00:02:41.650> me<00:02:41.740> show<00:02:42.130> you<00:02:42.300> like<00:02:43.300> so<00:02:45.180> take<00:02:46.180> out

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
debris let me show you like so take out

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.170 
debris let me show you like so take out
this<00:02:46.540> leg<00:02:46.900> or<00:02:47.140> something<00:02:47.170> I<00:02:47.800> don't<00:02:47.890> know<00:02:48.340> over

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
this leg or something I don't know over

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.350 
this leg or something I don't know over
I<00:02:49.360> mean<00:02:49.660> it's<00:02:49.870> reported<00:02:50.440> joint<00:02:50.710> and<00:02:51.220> you<00:02:52.210> know

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
I mean it's reported joint and you know

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:58.040 
I mean it's reported joint and you know
why<00:02:53.010> because<00:02:54.010> this<00:02:54.490> figure<00:02:54.880> comes<00:02:55.180> with<00:02:56.880> white

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
why because this figure comes with white

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.770 
why because this figure comes with white
revoltech<00:02:59.050> joints<00:02:59.530> that's<00:03:00.400> right<00:03:00.780> white

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
revoltech joints that's right white

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.800 
revoltech joints that's right white
revoltech<00:03:02.530> joints<00:03:02.920> so<00:03:03.460> you<00:03:03.520> can<00:03:03.820> replace<00:03:04.270> the

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
revoltech joints so you can replace the

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.990 
revoltech joints so you can replace the
black<00:03:05.050> ones<00:03:06.690> for<00:03:07.690> white<00:03:08.530> ones<00:03:08.830> if<00:03:09.100> you<00:03:09.430> like<00:03:09.670> of

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
black ones for white ones if you like of

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.850 
black ones for white ones if you like of
course<00:03:10.800> and<00:03:12.150> well<00:03:13.150> it's<00:03:14.050> the<00:03:14.140> same<00:03:14.170> box<00:03:14.620> but

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
course and well it's the same box but

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.949 
course and well it's the same box but
then<00:03:15.400> it<00:03:15.700> says<00:03:16.000> this<00:03:16.330> thesis<00:03:17.040> around<00:03:18.040> the<00:03:18.220> box

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
then it says this thesis around the box

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.180 
then it says this thesis around the box
something<00:03:19.959> about<00:03:20.080> ultra<00:03:20.530> makers<00:03:20.860> I<00:03:20.980> don't
