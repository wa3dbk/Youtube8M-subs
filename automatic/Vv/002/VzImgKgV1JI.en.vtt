00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.050
 Hail people are here in the master store. 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:23.100
 What is ecoville? 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.680
 curitiba and a beer that is causing 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:30.359
 very controversial and in social networks 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:35.190
 between brewers is worthy of a 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:38.250
 valley series that the 128 that is a line 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.129
 that made beer only the action has 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.079
 two 12 and has a support but style 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.660
 I enjoy that everyone has people who 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.610
 Proof hate you say it's very weird 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.070
 people taste and adore me particularly 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.629
 I really liked this type of beer already 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.629
 had approved other opportunities 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.280
 is a rescue of a very old style 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.070
 german a city style gossler it 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.500
 has by characteristic a beer 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.659
 many say that the origin of this 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.240
 style came because the water in the area was 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.729
 very rich in cereals and probably 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.979
 This brought the salty profile to the square. 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.680
 beer for this style only this year 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.920
 A pencil has been well known and is in the 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.130
 near the center of the 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.290
 germany and only that was the style ended 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.990
 practically being extinct 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.750
 I think that in 1140 another second war 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.380
 80 more breweries in pencils and 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.610
 brewing only ended up being extinguished 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.720
 and now with the American breweries 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.030
 mainly trying to rescue 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.920
 this beer and this style the first 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.200
 brewery you made in Brazil was 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.439
 abadessa side of rio grande do sul from 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:56.329
 Brewer Schumacker the first time 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:59.180
 I see who brought during the contest the 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:03.390
 juries 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:06.420
 some videos of them on the channel in 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.770
 of the tale with him brought a dose made 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.979
 with brewery california that 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.440
 Anac was very good and again I 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.150
 tasted was at the festival of the year 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.410
 prefer to closed some breweries 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.100
 beer making in england 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.200
 12 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:27.480
 Let's see how it is it's made 50 50 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.750
 50% wheat 50 per traditionally 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.330
 revenue is observed in the 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.190
 implementation of this here in the case 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.570
 do anderson edge 4.2 more historically 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.160
 she's out there 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:43.850
 actually four to five percent 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:48.270
 high fermentation alcoholic latika 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:51.170
 golden color and bright good 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:59.850
 formation of foams with a fine 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:03:03.690
 remains in the cup on the nose would not be a 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:06.690
 fruity and fruity aroma with a beer 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:12.410
 Belgian is not citric like that question 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.410
 of hops but by a mild psychiatric 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:22.709
 see if has the different purpose of 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.600
 belina one will take that has neither 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.820
 addition of salt and neither addition of cement 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:45.930
 but it has high power and 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:49.340
 different latika implementation in the 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.340
 nose and mouth 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:59.010
 very tasty profile 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.980
 only that much salted brewers do not 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:05.040
 Enjoyed this experience, I loved it. 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:09.570
 this experience profile salty 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.980
 dry polar fleece I slightly hopped 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.860
 I consider it a refreshing beer 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:16.230
 would put a beer in and to 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.750
 harmonize would be perfect and with fruits 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.940
 of the sea a place where you lay 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.160
 also one mÃ£ozinho already met this 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.620
 Acidity present as in the belina and will 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.090
 there also has that salty profile then 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.680
 to accompany dishes mainly 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:33.360
 seafood would look great episode 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.760
 already approved style 12 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.790
 What do you think of this question of having a 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.100
 beer the drink is salty talking 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:44.510
 next she makes you thirsty 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.510
