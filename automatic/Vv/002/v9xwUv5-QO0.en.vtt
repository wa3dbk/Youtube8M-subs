instruments I'm going to take it in the
key<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.360> cuz<00:01:09.990> but<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.710> applies<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.340> any<00:01:11.490> key

key of a cuz but it applies to any key
it's<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.830> 145<00:01:14.729> in<00:01:14.970> octave<00:01:15.710> first<00:01:16.710> thing<00:01:16.920> you

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
it's a 145 in octave first thing you

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.020 
it's a 145 in octave first thing you
learn<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.430> octave<00:01:18.470> that's<00:01:19.470> always<00:01:20.030> you

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
learn is the octave that's always you

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.999 
learn is the octave that's always you
know<00:01:21.150> two<00:01:21.450> strings<00:01:21.780> over<00:01:21.990> like<00:01:22.439> don't<00:01:22.770> count

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
know two strings over like don't count

over<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.670> two<00:01:26.670> frets<00:01:26.970> higher<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:28.380> we've<00:01:28.619> got

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
over and two frets higher so we've got

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.510 
over and two frets higher so we've got
for<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.549> octave<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.770> the<00:01:31.770> pattern<00:01:32.400> we're

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
for the octave and a the pattern we're

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.109 
for the octave and a the pattern we're
going<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.700> work<00:01:32.820> with<00:01:33.470> is<00:01:34.470> fifth<00:01:35.400> fret<00:01:35.700> sixth

string and 7th fret fourth string that's
my<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.509> octave<00:01:43.140> okay<00:01:43.640> now<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.700> other<00:01:44.880> two<00:01:45.149> notes

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
my a octave okay now the other two notes

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.240 
my a octave okay now the other two notes
that<00:01:45.810> work<00:01:45.990> really<00:01:46.170> well<00:01:46.320> with<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.710> are<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.040> 4

notes<00:01:56.060> so<00:01:57.060> C<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:57.869> D<00:01:58.070> ABC<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.369> D<00:01:59.610> are<00:01:59.880> four<00:02:00.479> and

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
notes so C and D ABC and D are four and

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.330 
notes so C and D ABC and D are four and
five<00:02:01.229> so<00:02:02.159> ace<00:02:02.610> octave<00:02:03.390> which<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:03.719> one<00:02:04.020> C<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.159> E

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
five so ace octave which is one C and E

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.690 
five so ace octave which is one C and E
is<00:02:05.460> four<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:05.880> five<00:02:06.439> together<00:02:07.439> they<00:02:08.310> make<00:02:08.550> up

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
is four and five together they make up

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.390 
is four and five together they make up
what<00:02:08.910> i<00:02:08.940> call<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.239> perfect<00:02:10.229> harmony<00:02:10.679> box<00:02:10.920> right

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
what i call a perfect harmony box right

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.530 
what i call a perfect harmony box right
which<00:02:12.239> you<00:02:12.390> can<00:02:12.540> find<00:02:12.569> anywhere<00:02:13.200> on<00:02:13.349> the

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
which you can find anywhere on the

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.069 
which you can find anywhere on the
fretboard<00:02:14.159> with<00:02:15.159> that<00:02:15.370> same<00:02:15.700> distance<00:02:16.209> except

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:17.079 
fretboard with that same distance except

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:18.660 
fretboard with that same distance except
when<00:02:17.260> you're<00:02:17.379> crossing<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.799> B<00:02:18.010> string<00:02:18.340> that's

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
when you're crossing the B string that's

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.539 
when you're crossing the B string that's
another<00:02:18.969> complication<00:02:19.769> but<00:02:20.769> for<00:02:21.040> example

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:21.549 
another complication but for example

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:24.000 
another complication but for example
here's<00:02:22.510> one<00:02:22.810> years<00:02:23.140> four<00:02:23.439> years<00:02:23.469> five<00:02:23.799> years

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
here's one years four years five years

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.709 
here's one years four years five years
octave<00:02:25.019> that's<00:02:26.019> an<00:02:26.230> a<00:02:27.390> now<00:02:28.390> if<00:02:28.450> you<00:02:28.599> know

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:28.719 
octave that's an a now if you know

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:30.960 
octave that's an a now if you know
you're<00:02:28.900> 14<00:02:29.349> and<00:02:29.409> five<00:02:29.739> it's<00:02:30.280> really<00:02:30.549> easy<00:02:30.819> to

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
you're 14 and five it's really easy to

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.809 
you're 14 and five it's really easy to
figure<00:02:31.239> out<00:02:31.920> it's<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.099> fourth<00:02:33.370> letter<00:02:33.579> name

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
figure out it's the fourth letter name

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.270 
figure out it's the fourth letter name
in<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.060> fifth<00:02:34.269> letter<00:02:34.480> name<00:02:34.720> see<00:02:35.500> if<00:02:35.650> dey<00:02:35.859> DNT

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
in the fifth letter name see if dey DNT

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.629 
in the fifth letter name see if dey DNT
so<00:02:36.970> if<00:02:37.750> you<00:02:37.900> want<00:02:38.109> to<00:02:38.170> know<00:02:38.290> here's<00:02:39.250> your<00:02:39.310> Chi

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:39.639 
so if you want to know here's your Chi

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:41.819 
so if you want to know here's your Chi
room<00:02:39.879> use<00:02:40.480> your<00:02:40.659> low<00:02:40.840> string<00:02:41.200> as<00:02:41.290> root<00:02:41.530> here's

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
room use your low string as root here's

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:45.059 
room use your low string as root here's
my<00:02:42.010> G<00:02:42.250> root<00:02:42.519> my<00:02:43.120> 14<00:02:43.569> and<00:02:43.719> five<00:02:43.900> is<00:02:44.109> C<00:02:44.319> and<00:02:44.469> E's<00:02:44.620> G

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
my G root my 14 and five is C and E's G

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.420 
my G root my 14 and five is C and E's G
C<00:02:45.400> and<00:02:45.549> D<00:02:45.730> octaves<00:02:46.720> here<00:02:47.079> there's<00:02:47.739> my<00:02:47.950> jesus<00:02:48.340> oh

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
C and D octaves here there's my jesus oh

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.149 
C and D octaves here there's my jesus oh
I<00:02:48.489> see<00:02:48.730> this<00:02:48.849> my<00:02:49.030> ideas<00:02:49.450> my<00:02:49.480> octave<00:02:50.230> that<00:02:50.920> works

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:51.159 
I see this my ideas my octave that works

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:53.550 
I see this my ideas my octave that works
on<00:02:51.340> every<00:02:52.090> string<00:02:52.569> like<00:02:52.750> you<00:02:52.959> can<00:02:53.139> move<00:02:53.260> over

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
on every string like you can move over

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.789 
on every string like you can move over
like<00:02:53.739> if<00:02:53.919> this<00:02:54.069> is<00:02:54.250> d<00:02:55.260> that's<00:02:56.260> on<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:56.560> fifth

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
like if this is d that's on the fifth

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.809 
like if this is d that's on the fifth
fret<00:02:56.980> and<00:02:57.870> that's<00:02:58.870> fifth<00:02:59.739> string<00:02:59.980> fifth<00:03:00.310> fifth

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
fret and that's fifth string fifth fifth

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.490 
fret and that's fifth string fifth fifth
fret<00:03:01.180> and<00:03:01.620> if<00:03:02.620> my<00:03:02.799> if<00:03:03.569> there's<00:03:04.569> my<00:03:04.810> octave<00:03:05.290> this

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
fret and if my if there's my octave this

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.120 
fret and if my if there's my octave this
daj<00:03:06.220> or<00:03:06.730> DNA<00:03:07.239> and<00:03:07.930> my<00:03:08.079> octave

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
daj or DNA and my octave

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:18.640 
daj or DNA and my octave
and<00:03:11.560> you're<00:03:12.560> four<00:03:12.800> and<00:03:12.920> five<00:03:13.160> is<00:03:13.490> GNA<00:03:17.650> so

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
and you're four and five is GNA so

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.340 
and you're four and five is GNA so
there's<00:03:18.860> me<00:03:19.190> there's<00:03:19.520> some<00:03:20.510> high<00:03:20.780> octave<00:03:21.140> D

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
there's me there's some high octave D

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:27.670 
there's me there's some high octave D
there's<00:03:22.160> G<00:03:22.640> and<00:03:22.820> their<00:03:22.970> say<00:03:23.240> e<00:03:24.430> G<00:03:25.430> and<00:03:25.670> a<00:03:26.680> and

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
there's G and their say e G and a and

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.920 
there's G and their say e G and a and
that<00:03:27.800> works<00:03:28.040> again<00:03:28.660> when<00:03:29.660> you're<00:03:29.720> crossing

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
that works again when you're crossing

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.660 
that works again when you're crossing
the<00:03:30.230> B<00:03:30.410> string<00:03:30.710> you<00:03:30.830> got<00:03:30.980> to<00:03:31.070> make<00:03:31.190> up<00:03:31.340> for<00:03:31.400> it

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
the B string you got to make up for it

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.720 
the B string you got to make up for it
by<00:03:31.700> one<00:03:32.000> fret<00:03:33.100> normally<00:03:34.100> your<00:03:34.220> octave<00:03:34.580> would

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
by one fret normally your octave would

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.770 
by one fret normally your octave would
be<00:03:34.850> here<00:03:35.180> two<00:03:36.020> strings<00:03:36.650> across<00:03:37.370> two<00:03:38.270> frets<00:03:38.540> up

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
be here two strings across two frets up

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.140 
be here two strings across two frets up
but<00:03:39.560> now<00:03:39.770> when<00:03:40.070> we're<00:03:40.220> crossing<00:03:40.460> the<00:03:40.640> B<00:03:40.850> string

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
but now when we're crossing the B string

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.030 
but now when we're crossing the B string
because<00:03:41.480> the<00:03:41.630> way<00:03:41.720> is<00:03:41.780> tuned<00:03:42.170> we're<00:03:42.560> out<00:03:42.770> by

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
because the way is tuned we're out by

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.620 
because the way is tuned we're out by
one<00:03:43.250> semitone<00:03:43.640> the<00:03:43.910> pattern<00:03:44.240> has<00:03:44.330> to<00:03:44.540> be

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
one semitone the pattern has to be

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.050 
one semitone the pattern has to be
modified<00:03:44.780> and<00:03:45.320> changed<00:03:45.430> this<00:03:46.430> is<00:03:46.610> how<00:03:46.760> we<00:03:46.820> do

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
modified and changed this is how we do

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.460 
modified and changed this is how we do
it<00:03:47.680> make<00:03:48.680> up<00:03:48.890> for<00:03:49.100> it<00:03:49.160> by<00:03:49.250> one<00:03:49.430> fret<00:03:49.670> normally

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
it make up for it by one fret normally

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.720 
it make up for it by one fret normally
an<00:03:51.470> octave<00:03:52.040> is<00:03:53.650> two<00:03:54.650> strings<00:03:55.070> and<00:03:55.340> two<00:03:55.460> frets

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
an octave is two strings and two frets

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.520 
an octave is two strings and two frets
up<00:03:55.970> but<00:03:56.360> not<00:03:56.540> here<00:03:56.840> when<00:03:56.960> we're<00:03:57.080> crossing<00:03:57.320> the

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
up but not here when we're crossing the

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.850 
up but not here when we're crossing the
B<00:03:57.710> string<00:03:58.750> every<00:03:59.750> else<00:03:59.930> everywhere<00:04:00.530> else<00:04:00.560> it

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
B string every else everywhere else it

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:12.790 
B string every else everywhere else it
worse<00:04:10.090> wherever<00:04:11.090> we<00:04:11.300> move<00:04:11.480> it's<00:04:11.810> one<00:04:12.320> morph

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
worse wherever we move it's one morph

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.700 
worse wherever we move it's one morph
live<00:04:13.130> in<00:04:13.280> octave<00:04:13.750> when<00:04:14.750> we<00:04:14.870> cross<00:04:15.110> strings<00:04:15.500> is

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:15.710 
live in octave when we cross strings is

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:19.060 
live in octave when we cross strings is
one<00:04:15.950> an<00:04:16.070> octave<00:04:16.540> and<00:04:17.540> so<00:04:18.170> you<00:04:18.260> could<00:04:18.560> have<00:04:18.590> one

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
one an octave and so you could have one

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.490 
one an octave and so you could have one
normally<00:04:20.030> for<00:04:20.299> us<00:04:20.450> here<00:04:20.660> in<00:04:20.750> five<00:04:20.960> is<00:04:21.140> here<00:04:21.350> but

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
normally for us here in five is here but

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:29.530 
normally for us here in five is here but
now<00:04:21.620> is<00:04:21.680> 14<00:04:22.520> and<00:04:22.550> 5<00:04:24.940> 14<00:04:25.940> and<00:04:26.120> five<00:04:27.280> octave<00:04:28.540> right

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
now is 14 and 5 14 and five octave right

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.890 
now is 14 and 5 14 and five octave right
out<00:04:29.690> of<00:04:29.720> the<00:04:29.870> scale<00:04:30.140> okay<00:04:31.420> hey<00:04:32.420> back<00:04:32.600> to<00:04:32.780> this

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
out of the scale okay hey back to this

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.980 
out of the scale okay hey back to this
again<00:04:33.080> so<00:04:33.380> wherever<00:04:33.560> you<00:04:33.800> are<00:04:34.010> this<00:04:34.760> is<00:04:34.940> 145<00:04:35.810> an

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
again so wherever you are this is 145 an

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:50.670 
again so wherever you are this is 145 an
octave<00:04:36.760> 145<00:04:37.760> an<00:04:38.000> octave<00:04:39.070> 145<00:04:40.070> ought<00:04:40.430> to<00:04:41.890> SD

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:56.070 

and<00:04:51.680> all<00:04:51.830> your<00:04:52.040> scales<00:04:52.400> major<00:04:54.250> or<00:04:55.250> minor

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
and all your scales major or minor

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.850 
and all your scales major or minor
diatonic<00:04:57.250> or<00:04:58.250> pentatonic<00:04:58.970> all<00:04:59.540> have<00:04:59.990> 14<00:05:00.530> and<00:05:00.650> 5

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
diatonic or pentatonic all have 14 and 5

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.820 
diatonic or pentatonic all have 14 and 5
and<00:05:00.890> up<00:05:01.190> 2<00:05:01.220> minutes<00:05:01.700> so<00:05:02.000> that<00:05:02.210> gives<00:05:03.140> you<00:05:03.350> four

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
and up 2 minutes so that gives you four

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.580 
and up 2 minutes so that gives you four
notes<00:05:04.130> right<00:05:04.730> there<00:05:05.030> out<00:05:05.330> of<00:05:05.600> the<00:05:05.810> seven<00:05:06.200> in<00:05:06.350> a

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
notes right there out of the seven in a

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.740 
notes right there out of the seven in a
scale<00:05:06.890> what<00:05:07.490> do<00:05:07.550> you<00:05:07.580> know<00:05:07.730> you're<00:05:08.570> a<00:05:08.600> lot

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
scale what do you know you're a lot

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.180 
scale what do you know you're a lot
closer<00:05:09.050> and<00:05:09.380> like<00:05:09.650> I<00:05:09.740> said<00:05:09.800> that<00:05:10.040> works

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
closer and like I said that works

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.370
