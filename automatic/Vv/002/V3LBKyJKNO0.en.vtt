00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.320
 and 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:24.570
 and well we are all in minecraft in 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:28.000
 a review of a way called iron chest 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.000
 this mode what it does is add 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.619
 good chests new chests to minecraft 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.460
 vanilla 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:40.210
 in version 1.7 points 2 this is 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:44.440
 done nothing ago, they are already 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:46.480
 starting to get memos for 1.7 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:51.280
 at good times because we're going to move on 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:53.829
 1.8 but good we go with the mod and good 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.320
 good as had been said before this 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.870
 what it does is add what it offers 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.660
 so it adds eight different chests 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.519
 ok let's start with the first 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.700
 this is the normal minecraft chest that 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:09.990
 it's three by nine holes and it's craft and 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:13.540
 as you all know and has 27 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.509
 holes is the iron is created from this 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.060
 shape with vanilla chest minecraft 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.600
 with ingots d 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:26.520
 of iron 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:30.730
 around and we do this and have 54 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.280
 hollows the gold is used the iron 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:35.770
 It's worth it with all the wrong ones are going to be used 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.620
 of the above it is worth the iron 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.500
 chest and then surrounds himself with gold and gives us 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:46.110
 the gold 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:48.120
 chest has 81 holes and good diamond 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.500
 this change a little bit worth is used 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:54.840
 the crystal gold chest up and down and 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.550
 two diamonds on the sides and we do the 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.800
 diamond chest that has 108 holes 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.619
 obsidian that is made with diamond and 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.700
 around obsidian worth is this new 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.229
 change anything 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.630
 both these do not change any of the 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.850
 crystal obsidian does not change 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.520
 we have capacity will only change as 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.070
 this is worth as you see the texture is more 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.040
 it's much better than glass 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.780
 the same is done with diamonds and 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.150
 around glass and we make crystal 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.580
 chest to an extreme not much because 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.820
 as you can see there are the items that are 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.820
 inside 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.120
 well these three are the part worth not 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.950
 they have crafter if you do not install some 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.870
 so that you 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.390
 For example, this is the chest of 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.990
 copper this chef 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:49.620
 has 45 holes this is the one of silver that 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:52.440
 It gives you that there are 73 holes and you need a 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.060
 additional mod that gives you copper or silver 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.100
 to make these two are worth because they shrink 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.000
 I think normal you can not get them 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:02.670
 except in the creative, as you see here 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.860
 this copper in silver but yes with is 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:10.500
 copper vale can not be worth and then at 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:14.470
 tell you what is done with a chest and 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.720
 around earth is worth it and I'll leave it there 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.800
 so you can see what happens when the 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.020
 breaks 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.630
 and that would be all thanks for watching the 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.760
 video I hope you liked it as it has 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.470
 explained everything since it has been very 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.410
 short but obviously this mod 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.380
 port is worth it if you liked as 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:35.050
 believes that the modes and nothing to comment that 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:39.480
 they liked it so that it does more and nothing 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.480
 more I hope you liked it and goodbye
