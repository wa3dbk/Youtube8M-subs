00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
your overall stats so basically here my

your overall stats so basically here my
speed<00:01:03.809> multiplied<00:01:04.290> as<00:01:04.350> one<00:01:04.559> point<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.949> which

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
speed multiplied as one point to which

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.990

means<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.360> in<00:01:06.810> game<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.320> will<00:01:07.770> run<00:01:08.130> 1.2<00:01:08.700> times

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
means that in game I will run 1.2 times

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.510 
means that in game I will run 1.2 times
faster<00:01:09.570> than<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.900> would<00:01:09.960> normally<00:01:10.400> on<00:01:11.400> the

faster than I would normally on the
other<00:01:11.640> hand<00:01:11.820> my<00:01:12.090> reload<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.630> slower<00:01:12.960> which

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
other hand my reload is slower which

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.730 
other hand my reload is slower which
means<00:01:13.470> I'll<00:01:13.590> reload<00:01:13.920> nor<00:01:14.670> point<00:01:14.880> seven<00:01:15.270> times

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
means I'll reload nor point seven times

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.070 
means I'll reload nor point seven times
as<00:01:16.740> fast<00:01:16.920> as<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.250> would<00:01:17.460> so<00:01:18.060> they<00:01:18.750> have<00:01:18.900> gone

things<00:01:44.490> at<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.939> moment<00:01:45.180> there<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.329> also<00:01:45.509> only

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
one a secondary weapon available which

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.990 
one a secondary weapon available which
is<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:48.000> m1911<00:01:48.689> pistol<00:01:49.590> which<00:01:50.220> is<00:01:50.490> pretty<00:01:50.880> good

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
is the m1911 pistol which is pretty good

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.539 
is the m1911 pistol which is pretty good
pistol<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:52.619> wall<00:01:52.799> well<00:01:53.070> there<00:01:53.189> also<00:01:53.430> is

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
pistol and the wall well there also is

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.399 
pistol and the wall well there also is
ISM<00:01:53.970> I'll<00:01:54.240> just<00:01:54.360> go<00:01:54.450> into<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.689> tree<00:01:54.899> thing<00:01:55.140> so

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
ISM I'll just go into the tree thing so

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.630 
ISM I'll just go into the tree thing so
what<00:01:55.560> we've<00:01:55.649> got<00:01:55.680> here<00:01:55.829> is<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.189> table<00:01:56.520> and

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
what we've got here is the table and

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.429 
what we've got here is the table and
we've<00:01:57.479> got<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.659> load<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.930> different<00:01:58.229> traits

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
we've got a load of different traits

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.480 
we've got a load of different traits
here<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:58.920> all<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.130> these<00:01:59.219> have<00:01:59.430> different

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
here and all of these have different

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.149 
here and all of these have different
effects<00:02:00.060> in<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.299> stats<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.869> each<00:02:01.829> come<00:02:02.040> as<00:02:02.130> a

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
effects in the stats and each come as a

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.920 
effects in the stats and each come as a
different<00:02:02.520> system<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:03.119> average<00:02:03.420> Joe<00:02:03.689> is

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
different system so average Joe is

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.639 
different system so average Joe is
basically<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.439> default<00:02:05.750> trait<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:06.990> what

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
basically the default trait and what

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.979 
basically the default trait and what
this<00:02:07.829> is<00:02:07.890> is<00:02:08.069> just<00:02:08.459> x<00:02:09.149> 1<00:02:09.390> of<00:02:09.509> every<00:02:09.599> stat

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
this is is just x 1 of every stat

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.800 
this is is just x 1 of every stat
everything<00:02:10.590> is<00:02:10.709> identical<00:02:11.420> you<00:02:12.420> don't<00:02:12.599> have

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
everything is identical you don't have

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.309 
everything is identical you don't have
any

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
any

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.170 
any
advantages<00:02:13.829> or<00:02:13.950> any<00:02:14.069> disadvantages<00:02:14.760> in<00:02:14.879> areas

advantages or any disadvantages in areas

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.149

oh<00:02:15.299> I<00:02:15.840> mean<00:02:16.230> you<00:02:16.349> can<00:02:16.499> go<00:02:16.620> on<00:02:16.709> to<00:02:16.739> ones<00:02:16.980> like

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
oh I mean you can go on to ones like

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:20.059 
oh I mean you can go on to ones like
hunter<00:02:17.549> now<00:02:17.760> what<00:02:17.999> hunter<00:02:18.359> is<00:02:18.510> is<00:02:18.719> a<00:02:18.799> sort<00:02:19.799> of<00:02:19.889> a

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
hunter now what hunter is is a sort of a

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.839

that we've got in the Alpha is the war

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:02.990 
that we've got in the Alpha is the war
machine<00:02:58.739> and<00:02:59.419> this<00:03:00.419> one<00:03:01.250> has<00:03:02.250> a<00:03:02.280> very<00:03:02.790> low

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
speed where the damage and accuracy

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.649 
speed where the damage and accuracy
considerably<00:03:05.909> higher<00:03:06.120> than<00:03:06.150> any<00:03:06.419> of<00:03:06.569> the

considerably higher than any of the
other<00:03:06.780> trades<00:03:07.139> now<00:03:07.859> I'm<00:03:08.129> we<00:03:08.819> thought<00:03:09.359> the

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
other trades now I'm we thought the

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.240 
other trades now I'm we thought the
system<00:03:09.900> because<00:03:10.139> it's<00:03:10.319> kind<00:03:10.590> of<00:03:10.650> unique<00:03:10.859> is

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
system because it's kind of unique is

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.610 
system because it's kind of unique is
similar<00:03:11.849> to<00:03:12.000> what<00:03:12.659> people<00:03:12.959> have<00:03:13.049> seen<00:03:13.199> in<00:03:13.379> cod

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
similar to what people have seen in cod

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.559 
similar to what people have seen in cod
whereas<00:03:14.219> they<00:03:14.430> get<00:03:14.609> benefits<00:03:15.090> but<00:03:15.329> at<00:03:15.510> the

whereas they get benefits but at the
