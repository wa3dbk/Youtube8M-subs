00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
but it's it's gonna be really really

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.990 
but it's it's gonna be really really
tricky<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.500> even<00:00:58.829> if<00:00:58.920> we<00:00:58.949> did<00:00:59.100> do<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.489> I'm<00:00:59.820> not

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
tricky and even if we did do it I'm not

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.610 
tricky and even if we did do it I'm not
even<00:01:00.059> sure<00:01:00.239> if<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.600> would<00:01:00.750> be<00:01:00.870> part<00:01:01.140> but<00:01:01.260> x-men

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
even sure if it would be part but x-men

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.470 
even sure if it would be part but x-men
seasons<00:01:02.129> almost<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.579> timing<00:01:03.030> would<00:01:03.120> even<00:01:03.359> be

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
seasons almost the timing would even be

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.759 
seasons almost the timing would even be
right<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:04.049> would<00:01:04.199> probably<00:01:04.350> have<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.559> bit<00:01:04.739> of

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
right it would probably have a bit of

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.670 
right it would probably have a bit of
one-off<00:01:05.129> or<00:01:05.939> like<00:01:06.450> yeah<00:01:06.720> order<00:01:07.200> 15<00:01:07.439> going<00:01:07.619> to

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
one-off or like yeah order 15 going to

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.050 
one-off or like yeah order 15 going to
be<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.770> direct<00:01:08.070> continuation<00:01:08.189> if<00:01:08.790> it's<00:01:08.939> going

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
be a direct continuation if it's going

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.179 
be a direct continuation if it's going
to<00:01:09.150> be<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.810> know<00:01:09.900> based<00:01:10.229> on<00:01:10.380> what<00:01:10.619> Keth<00:01:10.799> on<00:01:10.979> was

come back for Season 5 with a different

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.780 
come back for Season 5 with a different
plot<00:02:03.840> line<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.500> now<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.160> the<00:02:05.250> plot<00:02:05.400> the<00:02:05.610> time

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
plot line and now that the plot the time

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.340 
plot line and now that the plot the time
has<00:02:05.970> been<00:02:06.120> reset<00:02:06.420> there's<00:02:06.780> probably<00:02:06.960> really

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
has been reset there's probably really

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.430 
has been reset there's probably really
no<00:02:07.500> real<00:02:07.710> reason<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.100> revisit<00:02:08.280> them<00:02:08.670> but<00:02:09.440> he

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
no real reason to revisit them but he

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.110 
no real reason to revisit them but he
never<00:02:10.830> knew<00:02:11.010> it<00:02:11.130> existed<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.940> fun

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
never knew it existed and the fun

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.790 
never knew it existed and the fun
doesn't<00:02:12.600> probably<00:02:13.020> doesn't<00:02:13.230> even<00:02:13.260> play<00:02:13.470> into

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
doesn't probably doesn't even play into

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.380 
doesn't probably doesn't even play into
this<00:02:13.920> new<00:02:14.130> storyline<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:14.790> I<00:02:14.880> think<00:02:15.090> Eric's

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
this new storyline and I think Eric's

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.490 
this new storyline and I think Eric's
the<00:02:15.450> only<00:02:15.630> one<00:02:15.750> that<00:02:15.900> actually<00:02:15.930> even<00:02:16.320> knows

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
the only one that actually even knows

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.770 
the only one that actually even knows
