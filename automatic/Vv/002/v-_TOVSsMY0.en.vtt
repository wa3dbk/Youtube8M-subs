collecting money and stomping on enemies
but<00:00:27.869> that's<00:00:28.080> where<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.470> game<00:00:28.680> really<00:00:29.010> ends

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
but that's where the game really ends

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.849 
but that's where the game really ends
all<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.150> levels<00:00:30.510> are<00:00:30.660> very<00:00:30.689> very<00:00:31.230> very

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
all the levels are very very very

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
similar and they try to extend them

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.190 
similar and they try to extend them
sometimes<00:00:35.790> by<00:00:36.000> making<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.540> either<00:00:36.719> kill<00:00:37.050> all

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
sometimes by making you either kill all

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
although although one thing really

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.190 
although although one thing really
messes<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.369> up<00:01:17.549> it's<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.210> voice<00:01:18.390> acting<00:01:19.049> and

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200
