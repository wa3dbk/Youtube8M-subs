00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.040 
some scary moments about 23 of them I
counted<00:00:53.340> but<00:00:53.940> we<00:00:54.120> managed<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.420> see<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.780> over

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050

and you have to pay credit to this group
of<00:00:57.180> players<00:00:57.420> because<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.710> know<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:59.160> was<00:00:59.309> and

of players because you know that was and

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:07.130 
of players because you know that was and
that<00:00:59.730> was<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.879> real<00:01:05.479> sustained<00:01:06.479> attacks<00:01:06.960> from

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
that was a real sustained attacks from

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.899 
that was a real sustained attacks from
NC<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.560> thought<00:01:07.860> they<00:01:07.979> showed<00:01:08.189> tremendous

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
NC I thought they showed tremendous

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.940 
NC I thought they showed tremendous
character<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.810> keep<00:01:09.960> coming<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.409> keep<00:01:10.560> coming

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
character to keep coming to keep coming

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.130 
character to keep coming to keep coming
keep<00:01:11.130> their<00:01:11.640> heads<00:01:11.790> up<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.299> kneel<00:01:12.510> down<00:01:12.720> so

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
keep their heads up a to kneel down so

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.039 
keep their heads up a to kneel down so
they've<00:01:16.140> got<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.350> great<00:01:16.530> goal<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.540> I<00:01:18.540> feared

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
they've got a great goal and I feared

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.070 
they've got a great goal and I feared
that<00:01:19.200> perhaps<00:01:19.549> it<00:01:20.549> was<00:01:20.670> going<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.880> be<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.049> take<00:01:22.049> a

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
that perhaps it was going to be a take a

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.420 
that perhaps it was going to be a take a
draw<00:01:22.350> from<00:01:22.560> us<00:01:22.740> but<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.040> was<00:01:23.159> our<00:01:23.280> night

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
draw from us but it was our night

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.340 
draw from us but it was our night
tonight<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.970> sometimes<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.049> your<00:01:25.200> night

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
tonight and sometimes it is your night

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.780 
tonight and sometimes it is your night
we<00:01:25.470> got<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.650> break<00:01:25.830> on<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.070> first<00:01:26.159> goal<00:01:26.580> it

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
we got a break on the first goal it

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.940 
we got a break on the first goal it
looks<00:01:26.970> offside<00:01:27.360> we<00:01:28.259> had<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.380> couple<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:28.740> breaks

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
looks offside we had a couple of breaks

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.460 
looks offside we had a couple of breaks
here<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.250> there<00:01:29.369> but<00:01:29.900> you<00:01:30.900> deserve<00:01:31.259> them

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
here and there but you deserve them

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.080 
here and there but you deserve them
sometimes<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.340> thought<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.850> group

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
sometimes and I thought the group

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.649 
sometimes and I thought the group
deserved<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:34.229> breaks<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.619> they<00:01:34.740> got<00:01:35.509> we<00:01:36.509> had

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
deserved the breaks that they got we had

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.179 
deserved the breaks that they got we had
to<00:01:36.840> change<00:01:37.079> quickly<00:01:37.530> because<00:01:37.979> they<00:01:38.100> were

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
to change quickly because they were

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.520 
to change quickly because they were
causing<00:01:38.430> us<00:01:38.670> some<00:01:38.820> troubles<00:01:39.299> in<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.380> midfield

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
causing us some troubles in the midfield

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.530 
causing us some troubles in the midfield
we<00:01:41.189> had<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.490> just<00:01:41.670> have<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.880> little<00:01:42.090> adjustment

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
we had to just have a little adjustment

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.480 
we had to just have a little adjustment
after<00:01:42.780> about<00:01:43.079> 12<00:01:43.590> minutes<00:01:44.720> and<00:01:46.250> that<00:01:47.250> worked

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
after about 12 minutes and that worked

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.880 
after about 12 minutes and that worked
better<00:01:47.700> for<00:01:47.850> us<00:01:48.119> but<00:01:48.960> we<00:01:49.110> was<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.409> bit<00:01:49.680> loose

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
better for us but we was a bit loose

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.260 
better for us but we was a bit loose
with<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.130> ball<00:01:50.310> tonight<00:01:50.610> punching<00:01:51.149> in

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
with a ball tonight punching in

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.969 
with a ball tonight punching in
particular<00:01:51.540> in<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.869> first<00:01:52.079> half<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.590> he's

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
particular in the first half and he's

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.149 
particular in the first half and he's
been<00:01:53.250> our<00:01:53.579> main<00:01:54.479> source<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.799> retention<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:58.159> it

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
been our main source of retention and it

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.609 
been our main source of retention and it
was<00:01:59.280> ironic<00:01:59.399> that<00:01:59.850> his<00:02:00.000> goal<00:02:00.210> was<00:02:00.270> so<00:02:01.140> good<00:02:01.439> and

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
was ironic that his goal was so good and

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
it's a long haul but I think

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.900 
it's a long haul but I think
psychologically<00:03:33.870> for<00:03:34.350> Chelsea<00:03:34.769> with<00:03:35.549> all<00:03:35.730> the

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
psychologically for Chelsea with all the

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.729 
psychologically for Chelsea with all the
pack<00:03:36.150> kind<00:03:36.480> of<00:03:36.630> closing<00:03:37.049> in<00:03:37.109> on<00:03:37.260> them<00:03:39.530> the<00:03:40.530> next

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
pack kind of closing in on them the next

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.650 
pack kind of closing in on them the next
defeat<00:03:41.130> for<00:03:41.310> Chelsea<00:03:41.790> or<00:03:41.880> draw<00:03:42.239> is<00:03:42.450> going<00:03:42.600> to

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
defeat for Chelsea or draw is going to

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.990 
defeat for Chelsea or draw is going to
be<00:03:42.750> a<00:03:42.780> big<00:03:43.049> big<00:03:43.260> test<00:03:43.620> because<00:03:44.459> you<00:03:44.880> wouldn't

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
be a big big test because you wouldn't

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.059 
be a big big test because you wouldn't
want<00:03:45.269> to<00:03:45.299> lose<00:03:45.480> that<00:03:45.540> kind<00:03:46.019> of<00:03:46.170> lead<00:03:46.380> and<00:03:46.620> I

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
want to lose that kind of lead and I

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:48.319 
want to lose that kind of lead and I
think<00:03:47.280> that<00:03:47.400> can<00:03:47.549> play<00:03:47.760> on<00:03:47.819> the<00:03:47.970> mind<00:03:48.180> of

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
think that can play on the mind of

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.240 
think that can play on the mind of
pliers<00:03:48.630> and<00:03:49.019> I<00:03:49.440> think<00:03:49.650> man<00:03:49.769> so<00:03:50.010> you're<00:03:50.130> going

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
pliers and I think man so you're going
