okay in this video I'm going showing you

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:10.180 
okay in this video I'm going showing you
how<00:00:03.120> to<00:00:03.149> use<00:00:03.720> para<00:00:04.110> direct<00:00:04.589> gummed<00:00:05.190> paper<00:00:05.339> tape

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:10.190 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.499 

now<00:00:11.190> this<00:00:11.370> is<00:00:11.519> what<00:00:11.700> it<00:00:11.790> looks<00:00:12.000> like<00:00:12.090> when<00:00:12.420> it

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
now this is what it looks like when it

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.140 
now this is what it looks like when it
comes<00:00:12.540> and<00:00:13.370> of<00:00:14.370> course<00:00:14.580> you'll<00:00:14.730> have<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:14.940> lot

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
comes and of course you'll have a lot

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.519 
comes and of course you'll have a lot
more<00:00:15.179> because<00:00:15.570> I've<00:00:15.690> had<00:00:15.870> this<00:00:16.080> one<00:00:16.260> for<00:00:16.470> a

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
more because I've had this one for a

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.730 
more because I've had this one for a
while<00:00:16.770> but<00:00:17.750> comes<00:00:18.750> in<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.960> large<00:00:19.140> roll<00:00:19.439> there's

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
while but comes in a large roll there's

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.529 
while but comes in a large roll there's
actually<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.160> lot<00:00:20.580> of<00:00:22.130> tape<00:00:23.130> here<00:00:23.430> I'm<00:00:23.970> not<00:00:24.269> sure

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
actually a lot of tape here I'm not sure

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.570 
actually a lot of tape here I'm not sure
I<00:00:24.900> think<00:00:24.960> this<00:00:25.289> one<00:00:25.470> was<00:00:25.650> about<00:00:25.830> ten<00:00:26.220> dollars

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
I think this one was about ten dollars

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.279 
I think this one was about ten dollars
or<00:00:26.789> so<00:00:26.939> I'm<00:00:27.090> not<00:00:27.269> quite<00:00:27.449> sure<00:00:27.570> but<00:00:27.960> it's<00:00:28.080> very

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
or so I'm not quite sure but it's very

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.169 
or so I'm not quite sure but it's very
cheap<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:29.310> gives<00:00:29.490> you<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.609> lot<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:29.939> paper

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
cheap and it gives you a lot of paper

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.650 
cheap and it gives you a lot of paper
tape<00:00:31.279> so<00:00:32.279> let's<00:00:32.579> do<00:00:32.790> in<00:00:32.969> here<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.329> we'll<00:00:33.510> get<00:00:33.600> a

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
tape so let's do in here and we'll get a

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.530 
tape so let's do in here and we'll get a
closer<00:00:33.899> look<00:00:34.110> at<00:00:34.260> this<00:00:34.380> thing<00:00:35.149> so<00:00:36.149> when<00:00:36.420> you

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
closer look at this thing so when you

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.619 
closer look at this thing so when you
look<00:00:36.690> at<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.140> just<00:00:37.170> looks<00:00:37.440> like<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.710> strip<00:00:38.100> of

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
look at it it just looks like a strip of

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.729 
look at it it just looks like a strip of
maybe<00:00:39.629> 20<00:00:40.260> 20<00:00:41.129> or<00:00:41.300> how<00:00:42.300> maybe<00:00:42.540> ten<00:00:42.840> pound<00:00:43.350> craft

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
maybe 20 20 or how maybe ten pound craft

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.180 
maybe 20 20 or how maybe ten pound craft
paper<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:45.260> only<00:00:46.260> thing<00:00:46.410> different<00:00:46.829> about<00:00:46.890> it

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
paper and only thing different about it

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.540 
paper and only thing different about it
is<00:00:47.450> on<00:00:48.450> one<00:00:48.899> side<00:00:49.200> it's<00:00:49.440> regular<00:00:49.860> craft<00:00:50.160> on<00:00:50.460> the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
is on one side it's regular craft on the

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.389 
is on one side it's regular craft on the
other<00:00:50.640> side<00:00:50.879> there's<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.350> adhesive<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.559> you

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
other side there's a adhesive and you

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.250 
other side there's a adhesive and you
can<00:00:53.579> feel<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:53.850> because<00:00:54.390> it's<00:00:54.629> it's<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.140> little

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
can feel it because it's it's a little

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.250 
can feel it because it's it's a little
bit<00:00:55.530> sticky<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:57.030> shines<00:00:57.420> as<00:00:57.719> well<00:00:57.960> neither

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
bit sticky and it shines as well neither

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.139 
bit sticky and it shines as well neither
sides<00:00:58.620> just<00:00:59.010> craft<00:01:00.000> paper<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:01.879> how<00:01:02.879> this

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
sides just craft paper and how this

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.399 
sides just craft paper and how this
works<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:04.519> you<00:01:05.519> get<00:01:05.700> this<00:01:05.970> adhesive<00:01:06.689> side<00:01:06.960> wet

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
works is you get this adhesive side wet

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.490 
works is you get this adhesive side wet
and<00:01:07.830> then<00:01:08.700> it'll<00:01:08.880> stick<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.479> lot<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.780> times<00:01:10.080> for

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
and then it'll stick a lot of times for

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.380 
and then it'll stick a lot of times for
ball<00:01:10.890> shells<00:01:11.250> I've<00:01:11.549> never<00:01:11.790> used<00:01:12.030> this<00:01:12.180> on<00:01:12.360> a

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
ball shells I've never used this on a

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.120 
ball shells I've never used this on a
cylinder<00:01:12.750> show<00:01:13.049> but<00:01:13.290> for<00:01:13.439> ball<00:01:13.650> shell<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:13.950> very

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
cylinder show but for ball shell is very

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.190 
cylinder show but for ball shell is very
useful<00:01:14.520> because<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:15.119> lot<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.869> times<00:01:16.049> people

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
useful because a lot of the times people

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.469 
useful because a lot of the times people
have<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.740> cut<00:01:16.950> up<00:01:16.979> strips<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.729> craft<00:01:18.060> paper<00:01:18.330> and

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
have to cut up strips of craft paper and

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.359 
have to cut up strips of craft paper and
then<00:01:18.689> soak<00:01:18.930> them<00:01:19.110> in<00:01:19.200> wheat<00:01:19.439> paste<00:01:19.740> or<00:01:20.130> water

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
then soak them in wheat paste or water

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.929 
then soak them in wheat paste or water
and<00:01:20.549> then<00:01:20.790> kind<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:21.689> like<00:01:21.780> paper<00:01:22.080> mache<00:01:22.939> but

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
and then kind of like paper mache but

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.510 
and then kind of like paper mache but
this<00:01:24.119> makes<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.570> pasting<00:01:24.960> process<00:01:25.470> very<00:01:26.369> very

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
this makes the pasting process very very

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.840 
this makes the pasting process very very
easy<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.299> affordable<00:01:28.159> so<00:01:29.159> I'm<00:01:29.460> going<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.670> show

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
easy and affordable so I'm going to show

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.140 
easy and affordable so I'm going to show
you<00:01:29.880> how<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:30.540> thing<00:01:30.810> works

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150

I'm gonna cut it and about say 12 inch

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:44.500 
I'm gonna cut it and about say 12 inch
long<00:02:38.330> strands<00:02:39.940> about<00:02:41.440> and<00:02:42.700> I<00:02:43.700> usually<00:02:44.239> use

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
long strands about and I usually use

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.250 
long strands about and I usually use
about<00:02:45.190> 10<00:02:46.330> just<00:02:47.330> because<00:02:47.420> I<00:02:47.720> like<00:02:47.959> to<00:02:48.110> get

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
about 10 just because I like to get

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.690 
about 10 just because I like to get
quite<00:02:49.220> a<00:02:49.250> few<00:02:50.290> full<00:02:51.400> rotations<00:02:52.400> or

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
quite a few full rotations or

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.470 
quite a few full rotations or
revolutions<00:02:53.270> what<00:02:53.480> everyone<00:02:53.810> called<00:02:54.050> on<00:02:54.200> here

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
revolutions what everyone called on here

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.300 
revolutions what everyone called on here
and<00:02:56.709> I<00:02:57.709> like<00:02:58.130> to<00:02:58.160> make<00:02:58.489> mine<00:02:58.820> fit<00:02:59.800> if<00:03:00.800> it<00:03:01.100> fits

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
and I like to make mine fit if it fits

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.729 
and I like to make mine fit if it fits
too<00:03:01.520> loose<00:03:01.790> in<00:03:02.000> the<00:03:02.090> mortar<00:03:02.420> it's<00:03:02.630> going<00:03:03.500> to

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
too loose in the mortar it's going to

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.640 
too loose in the mortar it's going to
glow<00:03:04.400> break<00:03:04.700> or<00:03:05.030> flowerpot<00:03:05.900> if<00:03:06.140> it's<00:03:06.440> too

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
glow break or flowerpot if it's too

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.920 
glow break or flowerpot if it's too
tightly<00:03:06.920> at<00:03:07.190> my<00:03:07.310> flowerpot<00:03:07.640> also<00:03:08.060> so<00:03:08.330> what

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
tightly at my flowerpot also so what

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.870 
tightly at my flowerpot also so what
I've<00:03:09.050> discovered<00:03:09.470> is<00:03:09.770> I<00:03:09.800> like<00:03:10.130> to<00:03:10.160> paste<00:03:10.519> mine

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
I've discovered is I like to paste mine

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.500 
I've discovered is I like to paste mine
until<00:03:11.810> there's<00:03:11.989> about<00:03:12.350> a<00:03:12.880> millimeter<00:03:13.880> on<00:03:14.120> each

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
until there's about a millimeter on each

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.509 
until there's about a millimeter on each
side<00:03:14.780> so<00:03:15.260> that<00:03:15.500> when<00:03:15.709> you<00:03:15.799> shake<00:03:16.040> it<00:03:16.070> back<00:03:16.340> if

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
side so that when you shake it back if

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.580 
side so that when you shake it back if
you<00:03:16.549> hold<00:03:16.850> them<00:03:16.940> the<00:03:17.060> quick<00:03:17.269> match<00:03:17.480> and<00:03:17.840> you're

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
you hold them the quick match and you're

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.020 
you hold them the quick match and you're
shaking<00:03:18.950> it<00:03:19.070> back<00:03:19.220> and<00:03:19.400> forth<00:03:19.670> it<00:03:19.820> doesn't

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
shaking it back and forth it doesn't

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.560 
shaking it back and forth it doesn't
rattle<00:03:20.269> but<00:03:20.630> it<00:03:20.750> moves<00:03:21.019> a<00:03:21.140> little<00:03:21.170> bit<00:03:21.560> but<00:03:22.570> so

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
rattle but it moves a little bit but so

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:24.910 
rattle but it moves a little bit but so
how<00:03:23.690> you<00:03:23.750> do<00:03:23.930> this<00:03:24.110> is<00:03:24.290> you<00:03:24.410> take<00:03:24.440> the<00:03:24.799> adhesive

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
how you do this is you take the adhesive

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.880 
how you do this is you take the adhesive
side<00:03:25.549> and<00:03:25.880> you<00:03:26.660> just<00:03:26.840> run<00:03:27.140> it<00:03:27.170> on<00:03:27.380> the<00:03:27.620> sponge

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
side and you just run it on the sponge

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
side and you just run it on the sponge
here<00:03:28.570> and<00:03:29.570> I<00:03:29.690> run<00:03:29.930> it<00:03:30.019> about<00:03:30.580> three<00:03:31.580> times

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
here and I run it about three times

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.930 
here and I run it about three times
until<00:03:32.620> you<00:03:33.620> can<00:03:33.769> see<00:03:33.950> some<00:03:34.190> moisture<00:03:34.370> on<00:03:34.820> the

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
until you can see some moisture on the

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.810 
until you can see some moisture on the
back<00:03:35.180> and<00:03:35.480> the<00:03:36.380> front<00:03:36.560> is<00:03:36.799> very<00:03:37.100> shiny<00:03:37.489> and

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
back and the front is very shiny and

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.590 
back and the front is very shiny and
almost<00:03:38.120> slimy<00:03:38.510> to<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:38.930> touch<00:03:40.000> and<00:03:41.000> I'm<00:03:41.330> going

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
almost slimy to the touch and I'm going

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.100 
almost slimy to the touch and I'm going
to<00:03:41.780> run<00:03:41.989> this<00:03:42.140> on<00:03:42.350> the<00:03:42.440> equator<00:03:43.090> here<00:03:44.090> or<00:03:45.080> I

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
to run this on the equator here or I

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.960 
to run this on the equator here or I
like<00:03:45.320> about<00:03:45.470> this<00:03:45.739> is<00:03:45.980> in<00:03:46.100> the<00:03:46.190> past<00:03:46.430> I've<00:03:46.730> made

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
like about this is in the past I've made

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.190 
like about this is in the past I've made
four<00:03:47.810> I've<00:03:48.230> used<00:03:48.470> paper<00:03:48.739> mache<00:03:49.250> and<00:03:49.900> I<00:03:50.900> found

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
four I've used paper mache and I found

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.550 
four I've used paper mache and I found
that<00:03:51.260> the<00:03:51.350> paper<00:03:51.590> mache<00:03:52.070> method<00:03:52.670> wets<00:03:53.360> the

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
that the paper mache method wets the

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.120 
that the paper mache method wets the
contents<00:03:54.560> of<00:03:54.709> the<00:03:55.580> shell<00:03:55.820> it'll<00:03:56.890> make<00:03:57.890> the

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
contents of the shell it'll make the

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.060 
contents of the shell it'll make the
paper<00:03:58.970> hemisphere<00:03:59.630> really<00:03:59.900> soggy<00:04:00.140> and<00:04:00.590> it'll

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
paper hemisphere really soggy and it'll

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.449 
paper hemisphere really soggy and it'll
get<00:04:01.220> the<00:04:01.370> interior<00:04:01.640> of<00:04:01.970> your<00:04:02.030> shell<00:04:02.860> wet<00:04:03.860> and

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
get the interior of your shell wet and

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.850 
get the interior of your shell wet and
so<00:04:04.760> and<00:04:05.090> you<00:04:05.140> can't<00:04:06.140> really<00:04:06.260> just<00:04:06.440> crack<00:04:06.709> it

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
so and you can't really just crack it

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.160 
so and you can't really just crack it
open<00:04:06.980> to<00:04:07.250> see<00:04:07.400> if<00:04:07.489> the<00:04:07.640> stars<00:04:07.970> are<00:04:08.209> you<00:04:09.079> know

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
open to see if the stars are you know

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:15.190 
open to see if the stars are you know
dry<00:04:09.560> yet<00:04:09.829> because<00:04:10.310> it's<00:04:11.500> you<00:04:12.500> know<00:04:12.730> so<00:04:14.200> I'm

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
dry yet because it's you know so I'm

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.640 
dry yet because it's you know so I'm
getting<00:04:15.440> about<00:04:15.770> one<00:04:15.980> and<00:04:16.099> a<00:04:16.190> half<00:04:16.370> turns

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
getting about one and a half turns

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.129 
getting about one and a half turns
from<00:04:19.370> these<00:04:19.549> 12<00:04:20.030> inch<00:04:20.180> strips<00:04:20.570> and<00:04:20.870> you<00:04:20.989> can

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
from these 12 inch strips and you can

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.230 
from these 12 inch strips and you can
calculate<00:04:21.560> it<00:04:21.709> out<00:04:21.799> to<00:04:22.130> do<00:04:22.280> like<00:04:22.460> one<00:04:22.730> or<00:04:23.060> a

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
calculate it out to do like one or a

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.570 
calculate it out to do like one or a
little<00:04:24.020> bit<00:04:24.169> but<00:04:24.410> basically<00:04:24.980> I'm<00:04:25.520> just

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
little bit but basically I'm just

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.659 
little bit but basically I'm just
turning<00:04:26.120> it<00:04:26.480> and<00:04:26.960> then<00:04:27.680> after<00:04:27.949> I<00:04:27.979> paste<00:04:28.310> it<00:04:28.460> on

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669 
turning it and then after I paste it on

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:31.030 
turning it and then after I paste it on
there<00:04:28.940> it's<00:04:29.150> super<00:04:29.750> sticky<00:04:30.020> almost<00:04:30.590> like<00:04:30.770> glue

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
there it's super sticky almost like glue

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.890 
there it's super sticky almost like glue
and<00:04:31.370> then<00:04:31.910> I'm<00:04:32.060> just<00:04:32.180> working<00:04:32.600> it<00:04:32.720> tight

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
and then I'm just working it tight

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.320 
and then I'm just working it tight
working<00:04:33.139> out<00:04:33.410> in<00:04:33.530> the<00:04:33.620> air<00:04:33.770> bubbles<00:04:34.240> trying<00:04:35.240> to

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
working out in the air bubbles trying to

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.960 
working out in the air bubbles trying to
get<00:04:35.449> the<00:04:35.570> creases<00:04:36.080> as<00:04:36.550> flat<00:04:37.550> as<00:04:37.729> possible<00:04:39.970> like

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
get the creases as flat as possible like

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.689 
get the creases as flat as possible like
so<00:04:41.240> and<00:04:41.449> then<00:04:41.660> just<00:04:41.690> keep<00:04:42.110> working<00:04:42.560> this<00:04:42.710> along

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:50.100 

until<00:04:47.290> your<00:04:48.290> shells<00:04:48.530> that<00:04:48.710> is<00:04:49.130> the<00:04:49.400> desired

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
until your shells that is the desired

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.450 
until your shells that is the desired
width<00:04:51.970> so<00:04:52.970> just<00:04:53.150> keep<00:04:53.330> pasting<00:04:53.780> this<00:04:53.930> um<00:04:54.460> you

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
width so just keep pasting this um you

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.430 
width so just keep pasting this um you
don't<00:04:55.550> have<00:04:55.669> to<00:04:56.030> do<00:04:56.210> one<00:04:56.630> covering<00:04:57.169> and<00:04:57.350> then

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
don't have to do one covering and then

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.659 
don't have to do one covering and then
let<00:04:57.560> it<00:04:57.590> dry<00:04:57.680> you<00:04:57.950> can<00:04:58.130> just<00:04:58.430> do<00:04:58.520> the<00:04:58.639> whole

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
let it dry you can just do the whole

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:02.379 
let it dry you can just do the whole
thing<00:04:59.060> then<00:04:59.210> let<00:04:59.330> it<00:04:59.360> dry<00:04:59.889> so<00:05:01.210> yeah<00:05:02.210> it's

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:02.389 
thing then let it dry so yeah it's

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:04.780 
thing then let it dry so yeah it's
pretty<00:05:02.540> much<00:05:02.750> it<00:05:02.990> um<00:05:03.229> think<00:05:04.160> about<00:05:04.370> this<00:05:04.550> those

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
pretty much it um think about this those

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.750 
pretty much it um think about this those
at<00:05:04.970> the<00:05:05.060> edges<00:05:05.479> see<00:05:06.200> that<00:05:06.440> a<00:05:06.680> little<00:05:07.520> bit

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
at the edges see that a little bit

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.909 
at the edges see that a little bit
crease<00:05:08.570> and<00:05:08.870> you<00:05:08.900> can<00:05:09.080> just<00:05:09.260> work<00:05:09.440> those<00:05:09.710> out

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
crease and you can just work those out

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.540 
crease and you can just work those out
really<00:05:10.190> easily<00:05:10.610> and<00:05:10.880> make<00:05:11.510> it<00:05:11.630> nice<00:05:11.810> and<00:05:11.840> flat

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
really easily and make it nice and flat

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.570 
really easily and make it nice and flat
so<00:05:13.550> or<00:05:14.030> just<00:05:14.300> roll<00:05:14.539> on<00:05:14.750> a<00:05:14.780> hard<00:05:15.050> surface<00:05:15.580> but

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
so or just roll on a hard surface but

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.700 
so or just roll on a hard surface but
I've<00:05:16.699> never<00:05:16.850> had<00:05:17.030> a<00:05:17.090> problem<00:05:17.389> before<00:05:17.690> so<00:05:18.260> now

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710
