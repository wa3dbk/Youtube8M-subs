00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
see how far the transformation gimmicks

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.020 
see how far the transformation gimmicks
have<00:02:17.680> come<00:02:17.860> with<00:02:18.040> something<00:02:18.340> that<00:02:18.459> could<00:02:18.880> be

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
have come with something that could be

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.120 
have come with something that could be
this<00:02:19.150> complex<00:02:19.660> I<00:02:19.989> mean<00:02:20.590> we've<00:02:20.739> got<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:20.950> master

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
this complex I mean we've got the master

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.830 
this complex I mean we've got the master
grade<00:02:21.400> Zeta<00:02:21.640> 2<00:02:21.880> point<00:02:22.150> 0<00:02:22.239> not<00:02:22.450> too<00:02:22.599> long<00:02:22.780> ago

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840

the<00:02:23.590> Delta<00:02:23.920> plus<00:02:24.069> we<00:02:24.280> had<00:02:24.400> wing<00:02:24.610> in<00:02:24.760> between

the Delta plus we had wing in between

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.160 
the Delta plus we had wing in between
but<00:02:25.270> that's<00:02:25.420> a<00:02:25.540> little<00:02:25.750> bit<00:02:25.840> easier<00:02:25.959> to

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
but that's a little bit easier to

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.900 
but that's a little bit easier to
transform<00:02:26.739> it's<00:02:27.250> going<00:02:27.400> to<00:02:27.430> be<00:02:27.580> neat<00:02:27.760> to<00:02:27.790> see

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
transform it's going to be neat to see

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.000

getting<00:02:47.950> green<00:02:48.370> that<00:02:48.640> shining<00:02:49.000> fingers<00:02:49.390> maybe

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
getting green that shining fingers maybe

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.660 
getting green that shining fingers maybe
two<00:02:49.900> of<00:02:50.049> them<00:02:50.230> even<00:02:50.530> but<00:02:51.160> one<00:02:51.310> thing<00:02:51.459> that<00:02:51.489> I've

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
two of them even but one thing that I've

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.370 
two of them even but one thing that I've
noticed<00:02:51.700> is<00:02:52.150> so<00:02:52.330> far<00:02:52.569> in<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.750> promo<00:02:53.080> shots

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
noticed is so far in the promo shots

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.009 
noticed is so far in the promo shots
that<00:02:54.130> it<00:02:54.580> doesn't<00:02:54.940> show<00:02:55.090> gold<00:02:55.390> in<00:02:55.540> a<00:02:55.600> frame<00:02:55.870> on

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
that it doesn't show gold in a frame on

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:57.090 
that it doesn't show gold in a frame on
the<00:02:56.110> shoulders<00:02:56.500> so<00:02:56.680> that's<00:02:56.830> something<00:02:56.980> that

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
the shoulders so that's something that

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.530 
the shoulders so that's something that
you're<00:02:57.310> gonna<00:02:57.400> either<00:02:57.760> have<00:02:57.970> to<00:02:58.269> paint

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
you're gonna either have to paint

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.930 
you're gonna either have to paint
yourself<00:02:59.290> but<00:03:00.069> I<00:03:00.099> guess<00:03:00.160> to<00:03:00.459> keep<00:03:00.610> the<00:03:00.760> cost

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
yourself but I guess to keep the cost

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.059 
yourself but I guess to keep the cost
down<00:03:01.120> but<00:03:01.269> then<00:03:01.630> again<00:03:01.750> we'll<00:03:02.530> be<00:03:02.709> waiting<00:03:02.860> a

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
down but then again we'll be waiting a

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:04.500 
down but then again we'll be waiting a
little<00:03:03.190> bit<00:03:03.310> longer<00:03:03.580> and<00:03:03.790> that's<00:03:04.030> going<00:03:04.269> to<00:03:04.420> go

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
little bit longer and that's going to go

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.280 
little bit longer and that's going to go
on<00:03:04.540> sale<00:03:04.959> in<00:03:05.260> august<00:03:06.220> of<00:03:06.400> this<00:03:06.730> year<00:03:07.110> so<00:03:08.110> that's

to seeing clearer pictures of these but

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.249 
to seeing clearer pictures of these but
that's<00:05:28.509> something<00:05:28.870> that<00:05:28.900> could<00:05:29.110> really

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:29.259 
that's something that could really

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:30.959

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:30.969 
revolutionize the way that you collect

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:32.820 
revolutionize the way that you collect
and<00:05:31.120> build<00:05:31.300> them<00:05:31.449> previously<00:05:32.199> you<00:05:32.530> had<00:05:32.590> to

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
and build them previously you had to

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.230 
and build them previously you had to
order<00:05:32.949> a<00:05:33.039> lot<00:05:33.250> of<00:05:33.370> extra<00:05:33.669> manipulators

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
order a lot of extra manipulators

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.059 
order a lot of extra manipulators
through<00:05:34.509> be<00:05:34.719> club<00:05:35.020> and<00:05:35.289> even<00:05:35.860> though<00:05:35.949> they're

00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:36.069 
through be club and even though they're

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:37.499 
through be club and even though they're
high<00:05:36.190> quality<00:05:36.669> they<00:05:36.819> could<00:05:37.120> be<00:05:37.270> quite

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:37.509 
high quality they could be quite

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:39.629 
high quality they could be quite
expensive<00:05:37.659> so<00:05:38.319> this<00:05:38.860> may<00:05:39.009> be<00:05:39.069> a<00:05:39.190> relatively

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:39.639 
expensive so this may be a relatively

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:41.939 
expensive so this may be a relatively
inexpensive<00:05:40.300> way<00:05:40.509> to<00:05:40.780> really<00:05:41.380> increase<00:05:41.710> the

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:41.949 
inexpensive way to really increase the
