 Libya port cache in a time not 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.839
 official 4 hours 03 minutes and 41 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.119
 seconds 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.980
 tavo vildósola enters the history of 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.080
 score international as the only driver 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.180
 in getting a triple championship in this 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.019
 race gave a very difficult tour the 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.269
 true that start 14 and finish 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.730
 second physicist back here from the lord 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.920
 lopez who started first had difficulty 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.380
 We do not get tired much at first had 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.560
 but a lot of dust because we are here 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:44.060
 that's what it's about 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:45.410
 well without any problem we did not have no 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.960
 we have setbacks we did not have 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.780
 ponchadas we got lost in a stream a 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.380
 little but we lost like a couple of 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.380
 minutes maybe 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.559
 the wind that the wind looks at 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.530
 many parts and it goes against us 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.850
 it was like coming from the north everything 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.560
 that we were going upwards we 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.659
 the wind was coming on us 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.640
 but obviously there were parts where but 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.890
 those who were and could attack a 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.820
 little bit better but without the wind, no no 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.440
 I think we would have been here in 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.119
 second place first for that 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.450
 seriousness that is not does not seem to be the 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.450
 first place 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.330
 Well, obviously very proud of everything 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.330
 the team because like you know this is not 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.890
 is done with a person is done with everything 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.140
 the workshop with a lot of people and we're 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.820
 very proud of everyone 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.320
 to all the fans and everyone that 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.409
 has always followed us 3 to the thread in san 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.030
 Felipe the Mexican team was already 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.070
 in the record as two-time champions with 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.409
 tim girls brain collins and roma karen 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.850
 but now it's the only one in the history of 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:50.250
 this serial against this simple neighborhood 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:53.280
 javi all the rest of the team acted 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.070
 as one today and it shows that yes 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.259
 here we are again three races at 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.479
 thread 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:04.470
 because the truth has to be to all the 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:08.580
 team is a very nice group very 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:12.870
 coherent and they really work from a 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:19.340
 extraordinary form 50 I think not 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:23.250
 had happened until today because 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.440
 much much much pride the truth 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.330
 We have worked hard to reach 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.680
 do what we did today and 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.620
 worth it 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.930
 Well, as I tell the whole team 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.530
 vildósola racing really that they have 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.840
 worked in an arduous way and 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.000
 very coordinated so it was 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.030
 perfect today 0 rims 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.849
 strike out zero problems so is that 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.129
 says all of 2002 alone they ripped the 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.989
 position number 14 reaching in the 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.849
 second place overall but for 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.889
 issues of times of departure was 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:59.200
 declared unofficial winner not 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:01.510
 endorsed was a relatively 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.549
 easy for me not because I did not have to 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.889
 get off the car we did not have any 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.599
 problem and well no no always has a 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:09.129
 day of those is that soon we are 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:12.989
 in the goal and then apparently everything indicates 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:12.989
 that in first and very happy 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:23.890
 the weather definitely for us 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.739
 it was very good the wind helped us 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.719
 quite and obviously with the wind 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:35.159
 less dust and very good for us the 

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:35.159
 subject the vision and the team 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.970

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.080

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.690
