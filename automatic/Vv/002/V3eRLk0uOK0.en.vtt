well hi everyone here's my review of the
Oscar<00:00:02.700> a<00:00:02.730> six<00:00:03.240> clipper<00:00:03.720> I'd<00:00:04.049> like<00:00:04.259> to<00:00:04.380> compare

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
Oscar a six clipper I'd like to compare

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.039 
Oscar a six clipper I'd like to compare
it<00:00:04.830> against<00:00:05.160> the<00:00:05.190> classic<00:00:05.879> 76<00:00:06.450> which<00:00:06.720> is<00:00:06.839> a<00:00:06.870> lot

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
it against the classic 76 which is a lot

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.280 
it against the classic 76 which is a lot
like<00:00:07.200> the<00:00:07.410> a5<00:00:08.069> version<00:00:08.639> for<00:00:09.090> pecker<00:00:09.269> me<00:00:09.540> so

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
like the a5 version for pecker me so

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.259 
like the a5 version for pecker me so
first<00:00:10.559> let's<00:00:10.830> take<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:11.010> look<00:00:11.070> at<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.400> size<00:00:11.610> the

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
first let's take a look at the size the

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.030 
first let's take a look at the size the
a6<00:00:12.750> is<00:00:12.900> supposed<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:13.230> be<00:00:13.320> a<00:00:13.349> smaller<00:00:13.740> lighter

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
a6 is supposed to be a smaller lighter

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.820 
a6 is supposed to be a smaller lighter
white<00:00:14.309> version<00:00:14.790> it<00:00:15.719> is<00:00:15.900> smaller<00:00:16.320> but<00:00:16.619> you<00:00:16.710> can

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
white version it is smaller but you can

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.730 
white version it is smaller but you can
see<00:00:16.980> side-by-side<00:00:17.250> they're<00:00:17.850> pretty<00:00:18.150> close<00:00:18.740> in

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
see side-by-side they're pretty close in

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.130 
see side-by-side they're pretty close in
size<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.189> each<00:00:20.279> other<00:00:20.630> looking<00:00:21.630> at<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.930> side

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
size to each other looking at the side

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.800 
size to each other looking at the side
to<00:00:22.350> you<00:00:22.529> that's<00:00:23.430> plastic<00:00:23.820> 76<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.449> more<00:00:24.630> of<00:00:24.720> a

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
to you that's plastic 76 is more of a

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.960 
to you that's plastic 76 is more of a
cylinder<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.680> a6<00:00:26.130> is<00:00:26.310> has<00:00:26.609> more<00:00:26.789> of<00:00:26.910> a

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
cylinder the a6 is has more of a

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:27.950 
cylinder the a6 is has more of a
contoured<00:00:27.420> shape

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
contoured shape

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.410 
contoured shape
they<00:00:28.830> aren't<00:00:29.039> significantly<00:00:29.849> different<00:00:30.359> in

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
they aren't significantly different in

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.780 
they aren't significantly different in
size<00:00:30.689> though<00:00:31.140> although<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.890> e6<00:00:32.250> is<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.460> little

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
size though although the e6 is a little

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.810 
size though although the e6 is a little
bit<00:00:32.940> easier<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.570> grip<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.380> hold<00:00:34.800> on<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.160> but

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
bit easier to grip and hold on to but

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.600 
bit easier to grip and hold on to but
they<00:00:35.969> are<00:00:36.059> pretty<00:00:36.270> close<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.600> each<00:00:36.660> other

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
they are pretty close to each other

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.130 
they are pretty close to each other
looking<00:00:38.610> at<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.940> size<00:00:39.450> of<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.600> power<00:00:39.719> cords

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
looking at the size of the power cords

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.360 
looking at the size of the power cords
are<00:00:40.320> very<00:00:40.469> similar<00:00:40.770> they<00:00:40.890> both<00:00:41.010> have<00:00:41.190> nice

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
are very similar they both have nice

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.580 
are very similar they both have nice
long<00:00:41.670> power<00:00:42.000> cords<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.510> a6<00:00:42.930> adds<00:00:43.170> this

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
long power cords the a6 adds this

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.680 
long power cords the a6 adds this
transformer<00:00:44.309> box<00:00:44.550> here<00:00:44.820> at<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.030> end<00:00:45.180> it's

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
transformer box here at the end it's

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.270 
transformer box here at the end it's
going<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.899> hang<00:00:46.110> about<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.379> foot<00:00:46.770> away<00:00:46.860> from<00:00:46.980> the

this switch here and now for noise Oster

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.520 
this switch here and now for noise Oster
claims<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.700> a6<00:01:06.030> is<00:01:06.150> quieter<00:01:06.630> i'll<00:01:06.840> play<00:01:07.350> both

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
claims the a6 is quieter i'll play both

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:34.020 
claims the a6 is quieter i'll play both
for<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:07.979> so<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.189> can<00:01:08.280> get<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.400> feel<00:01:08.640> for<00:01:08.820> it

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.149 

now<00:01:35.030> for<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:35.330> blades<00:01:35.620> the<00:01:36.620> way<00:01:36.740> they<00:01:36.890> come<00:01:37.040> off

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
now for the blades the way they come off

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:38.710 
now for the blades the way they come off
the<00:01:37.190> machines<00:01:37.640> is<00:01:37.850> a<00:01:37.880> little<00:01:38.240> bit<00:01:38.360> different

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
the machines is a little bit different

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.890 
the machines is a little bit different
the<00:01:39.140> classic<00:01:39.560> 76<00:01:40.130> and<00:01:40.280> the<00:01:40.369> a5<00:01:40.600> they<00:01:41.600> just

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
the classic 76 and the a5 they just

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.990 
the classic 76 and the a5 they just
swivel<00:01:42.470> up<00:01:42.619> pop<00:01:43.220> right<00:01:43.400> off

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.910 

now<00:01:47.000> that<00:01:47.180> 86<00:01:47.600> they<00:01:47.900> added<00:01:48.440> a<00:01:48.530> new<00:01:48.650> feature

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
now that 86 they added a new feature

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.400 
now that 86 they added a new feature
which<00:01:49.340> is<00:01:49.520> a<00:01:49.600> button<00:01:50.600> on<00:01:50.720> the<00:01:50.869> back<00:01:51.080> that<00:01:51.350> you

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
which is a button on the back that you

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.930 
which is a button on the back that you
have<00:01:51.470> to<00:01:51.619> depress<00:01:51.979> in<00:01:52.130> order<00:01:52.340> to<00:01:52.460> swivel<00:01:52.610> it<00:01:52.850> up

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
have to depress in order to swivel it up

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.270 
have to depress in order to swivel it up
so<00:01:53.720> it's<00:01:53.960> a<00:01:54.409> little<00:01:54.530> added<00:01:54.890> safety<00:01:55.130> feature

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
so it's a little added safety feature

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.999 
so it's a little added safety feature
which<00:01:55.880> i<00:01:56.000> think<00:01:56.060> is<00:01:56.270> a<00:01:56.300> nice<00:01:56.509> touch<00:01:56.780> the<00:01:57.740> blades

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
which i think is a nice touch the blades

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.040 
which i think is a nice touch the blades
are<00:01:58.190> interchangeable<00:01:58.940> with<00:01:59.060> each<00:01:59.270> other<00:01:59.450> you

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
are interchangeable with each other you

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.300 
are interchangeable with each other you
can<00:02:00.170> swap<00:02:00.470> them<00:02:00.590> back<00:02:00.740> and<00:02:00.920> forth<00:02:00.979> so<00:02:01.280> you

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
can swap them back and forth so you

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.310 
can swap them back and forth so you
don't<00:02:01.520> have<00:02:01.580> to<00:02:01.729> replace<00:02:02.450> your<00:02:02.600> blades<00:02:02.840> I<00:02:03.080> did

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
don't have to replace your blades I did

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.499 
don't have to replace your blades I did
fumble<00:02:03.680> with<00:02:03.800> it<00:02:03.920> get<00:02:04.039> it<00:02:04.160> on<00:02:04.250> but<00:02:05.149> here<00:02:05.390> it'll

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
fumble with it get it on but here it'll

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.260 
fumble with it get it on but here it'll
snap<00:02:05.899> right<00:02:06.080> into<00:02:06.259> place<00:02:06.410> and<00:02:06.830> then<00:02:07.820> run<00:02:08.090> just

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
snap right into place and then run just

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:17.440 
snap right into place and then run just
fine<00:02:14.950> so<00:02:15.950> that<00:02:16.190> completes<00:02:16.640> my<00:02:16.790> comparison<00:02:17.239> of
