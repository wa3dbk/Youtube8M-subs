00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.479 

internal<00:00:43.150> mini<00:00:43.329> protein<00:00:43.839> skimmer<00:00:44.230> 115<00:00:45.220> and

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
internal mini protein skimmer 115 and

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.020 
internal mini protein skimmer 115 and
compare<00:00:46.360> that<00:00:46.390> to<00:00:46.600> the<00:00:46.960> aqua<00:00:47.440> yellow<00:00:47.589> skimmer

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
opinion and I personally find that the

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.300 
opinion and I personally find that the
aquatic<00:01:48.460> life<00:01:49.500> insert<00:01:50.500> a<00:01:50.530> mini<00:01:50.829> protein

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
aquatic life insert a mini protein

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.310 
aquatic life insert a mini protein
skimmer<00:01:51.990> 115<00:01:52.990> a<00:01:53.229> little<00:01:53.920> easier<00:01:54.219> to<00:01:54.369> use<00:01:54.579> I

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
skimmer 115 a little easier to use I

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.620 
skimmer 115 a little easier to use I
think<00:01:56.320> it's<00:01:56.649> made<00:01:57.280> a<00:01:57.640> little<00:01:58.210> better<00:01:58.420> with<00:01:58.570> a

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
think it's made a little better with a

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.940 
think it's made a little better with a
harder<00:01:58.990> plastic<00:01:59.200> than<00:01:59.740> the<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:02.500> Aqua<00:02:02.649> euro

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
harder plastic than the the Aqua euro

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.819 
harder plastic than the the Aqua euro
skimmer<00:02:03.990> but<00:02:04.990> I<00:02:05.170> just<00:02:05.320> wanted<00:02:05.530> to<00:02:05.619> show<00:02:05.799> you

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:10.729 
skimmer but I just wanted to show you
just<00:02:06.250> a<00:02:06.579> quick<00:02:06.789> comparison<00:02:07.030> in<00:02:07.810> the<00:02:08.679> color<00:02:09.340> and

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739
