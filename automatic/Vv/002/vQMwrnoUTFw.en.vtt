 It will be brightening the store tab 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.520
 raising the party by brightening up our 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.939
 city, it's good to have you here in 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.630
 cachoeiro connected for receiving denied 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.760
 so warm that good we are to 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.890
 magazine read the magazine you want to know a 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.290
 lots of things that are going on 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:37.380
 put the gossip we will not tell 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:47.789
 not the foquinha foquinha then look there 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:50.789
 Who is a student letter only stays and are several 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:01:05.519
 therapy sessions for the extensive exchange 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:01:06.510
 I think it's a person there, we know. 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.299
 that blog bomb 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.270
 nelson blog is one thing that is in 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:19.400
 another level as the idea of the 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.400
 blog how long has a blog from 2007 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.310
 nothing is thought nothing programmed was a 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.610
 joke even in fact I always 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.100
 I had a blog since I was little, let me 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.970
 I have a computer but this blog that 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.590
 there is today 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:40.600
 in this format and is since 2007 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.710
 with no specific purpose 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.049
 created 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.570
 I think the coolest blog too 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:48.399
 The idea is that you come out looking for you. 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.280
 you can travel as you would like 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:53.490
 know the stores also with you 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.530
 quite so I travel 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.319
 pretty and for Brazil outside the 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.080
 Brazil always looking and I think it's cool 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:03.850
 this thing of meeting people gets into 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.850
 contact with different people you 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:10.119
 perceive the individualities of each 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.130
 place to its peculiarities 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:16.750
 I really like a curiosity 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:21.519
 how many events per week does it depend 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:23.709
 so macho that male april february 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:29.230
 that this is a judgment usually has 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:31.030
 three a day for a week but it's a 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.090
 Average yes because because I have this time 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.870
 of each period the works vary greatly 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:41.410
 and has these times launch in stores 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:45.489
 other times on the show he will he will 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:47.560
 seasonal work such as fashion and how 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:51.130
 that thing works because the look of 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.200
 day is that everyone awaits your blog 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.299
 so famous how does the 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.299
 look of the day as you prepare you have 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:03.630
 that team that prepares how it is 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:07.570
 nor the sea alone in this way indeed 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:10.380
 it depends on your little one but I what 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.690
 in general I have a photographer 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.710
 You for the looks I used, what I 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.330
 I'm going to use it, I left it separate sometimes 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.400
 The photographer went to my house and 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.340
 Photographs out there the quality is better 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.000
 act so you can reproduce from a 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.830
 way a bit more professional more 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.410
 detailed or sometimes not your boyfriend 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.590
 even if it takes my mother to take the 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:37.550
 my stepmother also helps and frustration 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.230
 so it 's not a real thing even then 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.570
 depends on the situation if I could take 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.680
 with someone I shot cell phone and a 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.980
 mirror 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.710
 The important thing to register is not 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.550
 and how long have you been blogging? 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.920
 per day 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.470
 how much time are you online seeing the 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.960
 things to post by editing the photos as 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.330
 and you do not have this account that is the day 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.340
 all the best when you work in the 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.350
 Thinking blog academy because I 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.930
 I want to film it, I want to photograph it. 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:10.800
 something to post on the blog when 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:13.620
 I'm not waiting for anything 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.140
 I'm on instagram is when someone is 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:20.310
 match with mine or write some 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:22.440
 text to send me later find the blog 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.330
 It's so I would love you my life that I 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.920
 I can not say how many hours of 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.990
 work per day 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:32.160
 It's because you have to have dedication without 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:34.560
 I do not know what to do. 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.360
 What do you leave for the girls to us? 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.830
 You know there's a girl with everyone. 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.780
 both never make a blog everyone 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.120
 likes fashion to the advantage if she wore a 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:47.190
 thing is run and say you leave 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:50.280
 for those who want to create a blog today I think 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:53.910
 that originality is always I think the 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:56.280
 personality is what differentiates a blog 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.940
 on the other you have your identity and it is 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:02.280
 very difficult for you to create 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.410
 her identity so I think it 's 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:09.840
 this is the most important of the entity and 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:12.600
 know how to write in a clear manner to 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:17.370
 My style tip raises more than 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:19.170
 330 thousand followers I also want one 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.070
