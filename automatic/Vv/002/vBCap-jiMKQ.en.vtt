00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 this country in me just need to rest 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.609
 somehow and what could be better than 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.880
 kontra for holidays 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:12.000
 In general, I play court sometimes this is one of 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.400
 most frequent issues and labor citizens in 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.830
 surs play more precisely before played and a half 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.960
 years I did not stand this game and I 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.359
 I did not stand for this game, but then I decided it 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.080
 set to remember youth to 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.140
 rest that is literally 10 minutes she 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.570
 put downloaded all my updates for 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.360
 an hour and then I went to the server again 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.100
 forgave 20 minutes some sounds why 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.200
 always everyone put these infinite 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.879
 number of music sounds per server 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.219
 which is impossible to download 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.050
 damn I just wanted to go play and 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.820
 shoot this video but no need damn 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.770
 put that for sure u that dude 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.989
 which is now my mq will not weak 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.420
 didn't take for sure that he wanted music 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.660
 put a bastard mediocre so I 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.570
 more and all settings are standard I 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.260
 I do not like when the mouse runs fast so 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.750
 fine 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.149
 our our bomb set so now 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.640
 makes sense abyss somewhere on there 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.560
 already two are sitting so I will graze here 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.290
 this exit suddenly graduating from smart ass 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.250
 mutant will run out and then tactically 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.990
 casing from there 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.780
 but hardly surely most likely not by 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.790
 center will run here it is equal to sit 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.140
 don't laugh at me like that 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:24.210
 stupid tactics because he's great 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:28.230
 so hit this first frag got later 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.990
 year and a half we have and 2 will now be more 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.120
 volos blaming deceiving you like this 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.130
 don't laugh no maya tactics because 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.530
 that from a servant some kind of deaf dumb nobody 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.390
 who does not speak with the team plays from noodle 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.010
 Well, in any case, the first is 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.950
 you can make such a conclusion and what will I 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:46.080
 do in the second perhaps about rush zigu 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.060
 because everyone ran away in different ways 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.910
 the corners half got up again 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.500
 idiotic with their idiotic imperial lp 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.260
 I can not throw grenades 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.000
 will have to throw one more we can now 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.940
 you are running for sure some idiot 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.580
 now here stands and looks right 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.040
 for example, there is no running down below, but I braid and 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.900
 good that we are good that my snapper me 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.300
 helped who left ran otherwise everything 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.400
 ended very sad down to 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.070
 death could I give it still from the bomb 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.470
 Well, in general, a handsome man avoids which one 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.990
 a cunning dude ran out became n like me 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.810
 point blank probably shoot without sights 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.560
 it's there one more around the corner will come out now 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.340
 right now come out 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.230
 yes how I guessed I went for I think not 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.510
 he saw and I unfortunately with my scythe 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.120
 shoot me he was shields 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.420
 for sure because it seems believed 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.500
 cook the bill cook the dog is terrible 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.420
 went now too to clear mine 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.630
 the application will not give our more stayed 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.100
 he and even stupidly went more beautiful with two 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.920
 parties . 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.500
 fine here or live box for them 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.970
 with threads outside of me it was free to kill 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.340
 money left because the same team 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.620
 I won the purchase too 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.480
 I can now well, changing the bomb pancake 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.820
 See there is no hemorrhoids need but here I not 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.310
 I love those sukhanov which is public 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.980
 servers spawns bombs throw her out 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.840
 Someone like, well, dude, I run like this 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.510
 never will i be her up 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.880
 the last and will ass if I'm not her 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.790
 lay down 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.769
 So 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.109
 what 's another their virgil for that i dont 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:19.260
 I can quickly do everything have to stand 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:21.060
 Well, damn still going to the light ran 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.280
 okay now it's not terrible 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.959
 happened I do not know why is it blindly 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.170
 Thrown if they were going to attack 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:31.230
 here is my blind I immediately go because 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:35.640
 account give way dibil stuck ry ryo like me 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:37.560
 guessed handsome minute the round is already underway 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.659
 over was you still standing up normal 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.120
 in a minute came too would kill you 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:45.000
 there are no brains at all other kids 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.310
 so now the bomb as promised is necessary 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.230
 I have even put grenades lazy 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.090
 I already throw about Darvish 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.209
 there is nobody in the dark anywhere and the bomb 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.639
 put and now what a damn well 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.500
 fool again nagged I do with that 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:00.659
 countries always pass the bomb though of course 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.840
 correctly setting there for the boxes for my 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:05.970
 back but I'm used to sitting here damn it all 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.819
 even a bomb will not have time to burst out and sorry I 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.340
 I really wanted to control struggled 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:13.139
 and I would kill them all or the bomb exploded 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.090
 extra points were given to the family but to 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:17.989
 Sorry, bratyuni from my team think 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.989
 differently and killed all 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:26.139
 draw graphics because all ports 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:29.199
 draws graffiti and here's a lucky rep 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:31.690
 porashit but to have some of the mutants 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:33.370
 mutants what that sounds and he 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.820
 knows the microphone my husband would say that to me 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.800
 I do not know myself though 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.210
 usually all sorts of fools here would run on with 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.190
 that position sales history 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.260
 but you have to do it like that, of course 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.010
 not so dazzle i grenade it's just 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.380
 hands are crooked 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.570
 you need to throw and run well 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.820
 the sniper is fine here look again 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.789
 life doesn't teach a beggar I don't know what that 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.860
 same or new but what's the point guys 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:58.389
 stand on the spawn which is shot through 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.780
 on both sides if you know then write 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:04.780
 me a letter so b now see what 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.550
 there we take them comfortable weapons but not me 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.500
 did not even have time our team immediately 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.289
 put them start when I went for it 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.600
 was already 6 and now 76 in favor of our 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:15.850
 teams and again excellent respa for this 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.130
 same maneuver but if right now will remain under 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.720
 a bridge for the memory of a woodpecker 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.060
 laugh very much even possible 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.010
 I describe my pants because how many 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:27.110
 you can for this time I even flash drive 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:29.510
 probably to a normal movie 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.910
 and so go out slowly but somewhere toucan 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:35.320
 no, look no, no, but 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:37.730
 surely left means some 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.640
 look at my expansion went well 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:43.400
 that everything ended up beautifully still 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:46.810
 free so what can there 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:50.180
 be someone on both of them see nobody 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:52.160
 so what will go probably not there before 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.140
 shootout in the dark I already see on 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.600
 control radar now I will see fat 

00:05:54.140 --> 00:06:01.390
 Ass in sight means so look we look 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:03.770
 and here it is. he was planted by his brothers and 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:05.480
 again our team won I don't know 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:08.990
 country some sluggish gathered on 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:11.000
 naming is very easy very easy all 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.770
 right in the middle of the foxes see through 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.290
 hole so never 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.540
 Do not aim directly in the gap with ru Of course not 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.550
 women 

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:20.410
 aim the door on unfortunately through 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:23.590
 the door should be fed into the head but I could not 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:26.470
 with him half the body in some goat 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:28.840
 on our even shoot does not make sense 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:30.580
 the bad thing is that I'm stuck in this about in 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.800
 our weakest weapons do not know 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:35.500
 absolutely shoot so also the whole team 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.810
 my fools will make and in idiotic way 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.610
 okay I'll go myself to attack with her not care 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:43.120
 still problems that I forgot grenade 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:45.700
 buy blind leave this fuck with him even 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.920
 even us one i'll have a damn thing on her but 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:50.230
 better ran out and in what did not give because 

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:52.300
 what to count alone still plays well 

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:55.590
 okay ok played for the first time in 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.590
 a year and a half of the next game
