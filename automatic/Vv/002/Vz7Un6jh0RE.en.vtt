you think that Valley near had some
problems<00:03:49.579> because<00:03:49.940> you<00:03:50.510> and<00:03:50.780> few<00:03:51.019> other<00:03:51.139> guys

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:51.349 
problems because you and few other guys

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:53.920 
problems because you and few other guys
are<00:03:51.620> little<00:03:52.010> taller<00:03:52.280> than<00:03:52.519> him<00:03:52.700> I<00:03:52.910> don't<00:03:53.750> think

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
are little taller than him I don't think

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
the knockout on like I said he'd been

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.360 
the knockout on like I said he'd been
working<00:04:28.430> very<00:04:28.580> hard<00:04:28.820> even<00:04:29.770> since<00:04:30.770> Maggie<00:04:31.130> was

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370
