00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
today let's take a look at the bicolor

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.600 
today let's take a look at the bicolor
filters<00:00:08.700> available<00:00:09.000> in<00:00:09.690> color<00:00:09.900> FX<00:00:10.230> Pro<00:00:10.530> 4<00:00:10.889> this

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
filters available in color FX Pro 4 this

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.060 
filters available in color FX Pro 4 this
is<00:00:11.670> really<00:00:12.240> a<00:00:12.269> great<00:00:12.780> filter<00:00:13.110> set<00:00:13.469> it<00:00:13.679> replaces

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
is really a great filter set it replaces

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.799 
is really a great filter set it replaces
the<00:00:14.370> glass<00:00:14.610> filters<00:00:15.120> that<00:00:15.299> we<00:00:15.420> used<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:15.719> have

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
the glass filters that we used to have

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.499 
the glass filters that we used to have
to<00:00:15.929> take<00:00:15.960> out<00:00:16.320> into<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.619> field<00:00:17.119> which<00:00:18.119> had<00:00:18.300> one

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:18.509 
to take out into the field which had one

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:20.120 
to take out into the field which had one
color<00:00:18.750> at<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.020> top<00:00:19.050> another<00:00:19.590> color<00:00:19.860> at<00:00:20.009> the

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
color at the top another color at the

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.740 
color at the top another color at the
bottom<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.579> then<00:00:20.700> blended<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.180> two<00:00:21.210> colors

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
bottom and then blended the two colors

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.139 
bottom and then blended the two colors
in<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.079> middle<00:00:22.349> a<00:00:22.759> really<00:00:23.759> great<00:00:23.970> way<00:00:24.119> to

00:00:24.139 --> 00:00:24.149 
in the middle a really great way to

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:25.880 
in the middle a really great way to
enhance<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:25.380> scene

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
enhance a scene

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.819 
enhance a scene
however<00:00:26.550> this<00:00:26.970> digital<00:00:27.540> filter<00:00:27.899> set<00:00:28.169> is<00:00:28.439> so

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:28.829 
however this digital filter set is so

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:31.010 
however this digital filter set is so
much<00:00:29.130> better<00:00:29.340> we<00:00:29.669> have<00:00:29.869> absolute<00:00:30.869> control

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.020 
much better we have absolute control

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.490 
much better we have absolute control
over<00:00:31.649> every<00:00:31.980> one<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.279> parameters<00:00:32.850> the

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
over every one of the parameters the

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.600 
over every one of the parameters the
original<00:00:34.500> image<00:00:34.739> we'll<00:00:34.890> take<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.070> look<00:00:35.280> at<00:00:35.430> now

the Sun has set or is setting way off to
camera<00:00:40.949> left<00:00:41.329> we've<00:00:42.329> got<00:00:42.359> a<00:00:42.570> great<00:00:42.870> exposure

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
camera left we've got a great exposure

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.700 
camera left we've got a great exposure
really<00:00:45.149> nice<00:00:45.329> composition<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:46.379> let's<00:00:46.589> get

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
really nice composition so let's get

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.610 
really nice composition so let's get
started<00:00:47.390> the<00:00:48.390> color<00:00:48.719> filter<00:00:48.989> set<00:00:49.350> or<00:00:49.499> the

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
started the color filter set or the

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.619 
started the color filter set or the
color<00:00:49.829> set<00:00:50.129> over<00:00:50.940> on<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.149> right<00:00:51.300> side<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.570> the

color set over on the right side of the

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.500 
color set over on the right side of the
screen<00:00:51.719> you'll<00:00:52.050> see<00:00:52.109> the<00:00:52.289> color<00:00:52.859> set<00:00:53.510> and

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
screen you'll see the color set and

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.180 
screen you'll see the color set and
let's<00:00:54.690> take<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.870> look<00:00:55.109> we<00:00:55.260> have<00:00:55.409> five<00:00:55.679> different

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
let's take a look we have five different

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.200 
let's take a look we have five different
color<00:00:56.399> sets<00:00:56.730> available<00:00:56.879> they<00:00:57.870> have<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.019> brown

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
color sets available they have a brown

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.969 
color sets available they have a brown
cool<00:01:00.210> warm<00:01:01.219> green<00:01:02.219> brown<00:01:02.600> moss<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.979> violet

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
cool warm green brown moss and violet

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.850 
cool warm green brown moss and violet
pink<00:01:05.540> let's<00:01:06.540> take<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.780> look<00:01:07.020> at<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.229> cool<00:01:07.470> warm

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
pink let's take a look at the cool warm

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.960 
pink let's take a look at the cool warm
so<00:01:08.760> there's<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.510> option<00:01:09.840> number<00:01:09.960> one<00:01:10.970> option

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
so there's the option number one option

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.380 
so there's the option number one option
number<00:01:12.090> two<00:01:12.570> number<00:01:13.470> three<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:14.310> number<00:01:15.240> four

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
number two number three and number four

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.780 
number two number three and number four
I<00:01:15.960> really<00:01:16.320> like<00:01:16.500> number<00:01:16.890> four<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.400> let's<00:01:17.430> start

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
I really like number four so let's start

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.330 
I really like number four so let's start
with<00:01:17.940> that<00:01:18.000> one<00:01:18.650> the<00:01:19.650> opacity<00:01:19.950> slider

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
with that one the opacity slider

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.300 
with that one the opacity slider
defaults<00:01:21.270> at<00:01:21.420> 50%<00:01:21.960> if<00:01:22.320> we<00:01:22.440> slide<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.920> all<00:01:23.160> the

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
defaults at 50% if we slide that all the

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.560 
defaults at 50% if we slide that all the
way<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.670> right<00:01:23.910> to<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.120> hundred<00:01:24.480> percent

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
way to the right to a hundred percent

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.490 
way to the right to a hundred percent
we'll<00:01:24.990> see<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.290> full<00:01:25.590> effect<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.160> filter

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
we'll see the full effect of the filter

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.690 
we'll see the full effect of the filter
which<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.650> kind<00:01:28.830> of<00:01:28.920> interesting<00:01:29.340> but<00:01:29.490> it's<00:01:29.640> a

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
which is kind of interesting but it's a

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.580 
which is kind of interesting but it's a
little<00:01:29.850> too<00:01:30.000> much<00:01:30.150> if<00:01:30.690> we<00:01:30.840> slide<00:01:31.080> it<00:01:31.200> all<00:01:31.410> the

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
little too much if we slide it all the

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.100 
little too much if we slide it all the
way<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.980> left<00:01:32.160> we<00:01:33.000> completely<00:01:33.420> remove<00:01:33.720> the

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
way to the left we completely remove the

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.230 
way to the left we completely remove the
effect<00:01:34.440> of<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.650> filter<00:01:35.010> so<00:01:35.190> let's<00:01:35.880> bring<00:01:36.060> that

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
effect of the filter so let's bring that

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.770 
effect of the filter so let's bring that
back<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.630> about<00:01:36.810> 50%<00:01:38.120> that's<00:01:39.120> a<00:01:39.270> good<00:01:39.420> starting

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
back to about 50% that's a good starting

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.850 
back to about 50% that's a good starting
point<00:01:40.160> now<00:01:41.160> blend<00:01:41.450> blend<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.720> where<00:01:43.560> we're

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
point now blend blend is where we're

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.100 
point now blend blend is where we're
blending<00:01:44.100> from<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.580> top<00:01:44.880> color<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.930> the

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
blending from the top color to the

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.410 
blending from the top color to the
bottom<00:01:46.260> color<00:01:46.680> if<00:01:47.520> we<00:01:47.670> move<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:47.910> to<00:01:48.120> the

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
bottom color if we move that to the

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.560 
bottom color if we move that to the
right<00:01:48.770> we're<00:01:49.770> making<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.400> very<00:01:50.610> subtle<00:01:51.090> blend

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
right we're making a very subtle blend

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.660 
right we're making a very subtle blend
it's<00:01:51.840> over<00:01:52.110> almost<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.560> entire<00:01:53.010> image<00:01:53.310> from

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
it's over almost the entire image from

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.090 
it's over almost the entire image from
the<00:01:53.820> blue<00:01:54.060> at<00:01:54.330> the<00:01:54.810> top<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.410> the<00:01:55.530> orange<00:01:55.860> at<00:01:55.980> the

the blue at the top to the orange at the

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.250 
the blue at the top to the orange at the
bottom<00:01:56.400> if<00:01:56.910> we<00:01:57.060> slide<00:01:57.330> that<00:01:57.450> all<00:01:57.690> the<00:01:58.080> way<00:01:58.200> to

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
bottom if we slide that all the way to

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.290 
bottom if we slide that all the way to
the<00:01:58.560> left<00:01:58.950> we're<00:01:59.790> gonna<00:01:59.880> make<00:02:00.150> that

the left we're gonna make that

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.660 
the left we're gonna make that
transition<00:02:00.840> from<00:02:01.050> the<00:02:01.230> blue<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:02.190> the<00:02:02.220> orange

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
transition from the blue to the orange

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.990 
transition from the blue to the orange
very<00:02:02.940> very<00:02:03.210> quickly<00:02:04.250> and<00:02:05.250> if<00:02:05.370> we<00:02:05.520> take<00:02:05.700> this

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
very very quickly and if we take this

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.210 
very very quickly and if we take this
vertical<00:02:06.630> shift<00:02:07.050> slider<00:02:07.380> let's<00:02:07.770> slide<00:02:07.980> that<00:02:08.190> a

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
vertical shift slider let's slide that a

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.839 
vertical shift slider let's slide that a
little<00:02:08.550> bit<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.910> right<00:02:09.649> and<00:02:10.649> you<00:02:11.550> can<00:02:11.670> see

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
little bit to the right and you can see

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.880 
little bit to the right and you can see
how<00:02:11.969> quickly<00:02:12.269> that<00:02:12.599> blue<00:02:13.049> is<00:02:13.230> transitioning

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
how quickly that blue is transitioning

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.949 
how quickly that blue is transitioning
now<00:02:14.040> to<00:02:14.099> the<00:02:14.430> orange<00:02:14.760> let's<00:02:15.540> put<00:02:15.749> that<00:02:15.900> right

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
now to the orange let's put that right

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.300 
now to the orange let's put that right
back<00:02:16.230> up<00:02:16.620> on<00:02:16.769> the<00:02:16.920> right

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
back up on the right

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.770 
back up on the right
because<00:02:17.640> I<00:02:17.730> think<00:02:17.970> that's<00:02:18.120> where<00:02:18.330> it<00:02:18.450> belongs

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
because I think that's where it belongs

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.370 
because I think that's where it belongs
right<00:02:20.599> about<00:02:21.599> there

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
right about there

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.640 
right about there
so<00:02:23.160> we're<00:02:23.310> maintaining<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:24.120> whites<00:02:24.420> in<00:02:24.840> the

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
so we're maintaining the whites in the

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.710 
so we're maintaining the whites in the
seafoam<00:02:26.069> next<00:02:27.000> we'll<00:02:27.120> move<00:02:27.239> on<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:27.599> the

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
seafoam next we'll move on to the

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.750 
seafoam next we'll move on to the
rotation<00:02:28.230> slider<00:02:28.530> so<00:02:29.220> if<00:02:29.280> we<00:02:29.370> wanted<00:02:29.640> that

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
rotation slider so if we wanted that

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.309 
rotation slider so if we wanted that
blue<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.420> be<00:02:30.540> on<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:30.750> right<00:02:30.930> side<00:02:31.140> of<00:02:31.230> the

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
blue to be on the right side of the

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.140 
blue to be on the right side of the
screen<00:02:31.410> we<00:02:32.280> just<00:02:32.489> rotate<00:02:32.819> it<00:02:32.849> to<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.060> right

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
screen we just rotate it to the right

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.820 
screen we just rotate it to the right
and<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.720> blue<00:02:33.900> is<00:02:33.959> now<00:02:34.140> on<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.349> right<00:02:34.530> keep

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
and the blue is now on the right keep

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.820 
and the blue is now on the right keep
going<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:35.340> it<00:02:35.459> will<00:02:35.580> be<00:02:35.730> on<00:02:35.849> the<00:02:35.940> bottom

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
going and it will be on the bottom

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.199 
going and it will be on the bottom
rotate<00:02:37.830> it<00:02:37.950> back<00:02:38.099> around<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:38.519> the<00:02:38.610> left<00:02:38.940> and<00:02:39.120> we

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
rotate it back around to the left and we

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.720 
rotate it back around to the left and we
can<00:02:39.239> have<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.599> blue<00:02:39.750> come<00:02:39.959> from<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.260> left<00:02:40.730> or

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
can have the blue come from the left or

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.520 
can have the blue come from the left or
from<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.940> bottom<00:02:42.300> and<00:02:42.870> we'll<00:02:43.110> put<00:02:43.319> that<00:02:43.349> back

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
from the bottom and we'll put that back

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.839 
from the bottom and we'll put that back
in<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:43.920> middle<00:02:44.190> I<00:02:44.250> think<00:02:44.280> that's<00:02:44.610> where<00:02:44.760> that

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
in the middle I think that's where that

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:51.500 
in the middle I think that's where that
belongs<00:02:49.010> so<00:02:50.010> overall<00:02:50.489> not<00:02:50.790> bad<00:02:50.819> but<00:02:51.239> I<00:02:51.299> think

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
belongs so overall not bad but I think

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.330 
belongs so overall not bad but I think
we're<00:02:51.690> a<00:02:51.720> little<00:02:52.200> too<00:02:52.560> much<00:02:52.769> so<00:02:52.950> let's<00:02:53.130> reduce

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
we're a little too much so let's reduce

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.000 
we're a little too much so let's reduce
the<00:02:53.640> opacity<00:02:53.730> just<00:02:54.299> a<00:02:54.569> bit<00:02:54.780> see<00:02:55.530> if<00:02:55.590> we<00:02:55.709> can<00:02:55.830> get

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
the opacity just a bit see if we can get

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.920 
the opacity just a bit see if we can get
that<00:02:56.220> sand<00:02:57.060> looking<00:02:57.360> a<00:02:57.450> little<00:02:57.569> more<00:02:57.780> like

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
that sand looking a little more like

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.000 
that sand looking a little more like
sand<00:02:59.480> and<00:03:00.480> I<00:03:00.870> think<00:03:01.170> we're<00:03:01.350> probably<00:03:01.680> pretty

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
sand and I think we're probably pretty

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.430 
sand and I think we're probably pretty
good<00:03:02.430> right<00:03:02.730> there<00:03:02.760> so<00:03:03.690> let's<00:03:03.720> take<00:03:04.110> a<00:03:04.140> look<00:03:04.349> at

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
good right there so let's take a look at

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.370 
good right there so let's take a look at

the original and the after so that's by
