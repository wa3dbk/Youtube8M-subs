 you knew that the name of the mirror of the s upside down means desire a man 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.240
 suitable for the object since it shows the deepest third of the heart of 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.900
 who sees it equally in the book in English the name of the mirror is erice 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.640
 that the other way 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.870
 In the first editions in Spanish the translator did not realize that the 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.250
 name and the words on the mirror were written in English upside down like that and that 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.610
 at the beginning this kept calling was cleared from erice 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.930
 Did you know that in the United Kingdom the title is teipo? 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:18.930
 rest

 sorcerer's this josé to harry potter in the stone of the sorcerer 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.870
 therefore in the film in its original version every time he spoke 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.149
 of the stones had to shoot the scene twice with the two names 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.740
 you knew that in the editorial the the books of harry potter in the united kingdom 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.550
 mansuri asked jk rowling to change the title to harry potter and the 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.820
 philosopher stone imposed harry potter in the school of magic as happened in 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.760
 the case of the French version 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.890
 however, she did not agree 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:53.740
 did you know 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.399
 the author jk rowling wrote the first paragraphs and drawings in 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.399
 napkins on a trip to Scotland by the express of king's cross 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:01.740
 later 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.000
 they would subscribe to it typewriter 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.780
 many editorials up to 1 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.079
 they rejected the network 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:12.809
 at the beginning of the jk rowling saga he was so poor that he had to type two 

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:15.379
 times the manuscript of the philosopher's stone 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:16.599
 I could not pay 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.329
 so that you type unclear anthologist 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:23.719
 that was it with the philosopher's stone now we arrived with the secret camera 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:26.199
 starting with your curiosities 

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:32.439
 harry potter and the secret chamber was written in 1998 by the author jk rowling 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:35.809
 the Spanish version has a total of 280 

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:41.400
 you knew that the clock that has its own and at home is different in the second 

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:42.769
 book that in the room 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.550
 you knew that the book was about to be titled harry potter 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.060
 and the mestizo prince 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.069
 like the sixth book but ended up being Harry Potter 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:52.919
 in the chamber of secrets 

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:57.579
 JK Rowling wanted to include in this chapter book he finally left for the 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:59.129
 sixth member of the saha 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:03.029
 you knew that this is the only book that gives the year where the 

00:03:03.029 --> 00:03:03.829
 history 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:07.500
 Forestry says it's a 500th death anniversary 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.540
 of his death is nothing like October 31, 1492 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:16.719
 this means that harry potter in the chamber of secrets develops in 

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:18.340
 1992 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.859
 quique garrido was born in 1980 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:23.759
 as the author jk rowling confirmed after 

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:27.809
 Did you know that this is Harry Potter's first book, which was changed to 

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:30.319
 title to be translated into English 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:32.920
 is Harry Potter in the Chamber of Secrets 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.980
 while the Spanish is harry potter and the secret chamber 

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:40.139
 in history however it is still called chamber of secrets 

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:43.289
 now let's continue with the mistakes 

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:47.099
 round lolo miguel says that when he was three years his brother network 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.609
 he turned his teddy bear 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:51.739
 and disgusting 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:52.849
 three and a half years 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:54.799
 5 fortunes of these six years 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:57.799
 he was not old enough to change 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:01.329
 because these are one of the most difficult branches of the year 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:05.709
 On December 1, in the fourth round, he lives in the first floor bathroom 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.459
 however when caribe the inscription on the wall outside the bathroom 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.639
 they are on the second floor 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:15.969
 since the beginning of the potion guti played a hundred 

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:17.289
 twenty one days 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:20.989
 however rum made the three dead eyes on top of the leeches 

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:23.910
 They still could not fix all three eyes 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.770
 it was only the first day 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.699
 for spite and mischief those attacked by the basilisk 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:33.349
 these should take a position however sir nicholas is a ghost and 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:37.069
 As he stated in the first book he can not eat or drink 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:41.520
 the wands leave the power has the feathers of the phoenix tail 'taps 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.319
 who only gave two pens 

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:44.280
 but nevertheless 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.220
 to get out of the chamber of secrets ari grabbed the tail feathers 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.700
 of unemployment that is a possible correction could be that when reborn in the second 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:53.260
 book 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.699
 touches could have obtained new pens 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:00.050
 in flowers and blogs for river give a complete set of gender books and 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.849
 local 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:04.580
 he puts us in the cauldron of gigli muttering that he will buy his 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:05.360
 own 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.210
 before doing so the fight takes place and they leave the bookstore traveling home 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.330
 with Moscow 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.190
 how did he then get his own books gary finds the lady moore 

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:18.430
 specified on the second floor 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.690
 when your hair or asks you to follow it lockhart asks you to use your office 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.720
 indicating that it is located only when climbing the stairs which means 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.120
 that the oscar office tests on the third floor 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.370
 however later it is mentioned that jaric went to the corridor of 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.889
 second floor to go to punishment in the locarno office 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:39.500
 on the philosopher's stone 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.740
 it is affirmed that human and magic mobiles can not enter the alley 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:44.389
 diagon 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:45.360
 but nevertheless 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.030
 jeremy hunt is with his parents in said alley 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:52.940
 as it ended up changing women money and as everyone knows the parents of jeremy 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.289
 jones are women 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:56.069
