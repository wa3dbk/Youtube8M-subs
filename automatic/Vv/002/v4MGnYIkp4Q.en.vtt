00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.110 

you<00:05:18.680> can't<00:05:18.919> see<00:05:19.220> because<00:05:19.400> i<00:05:19.520> don't<00:05:19.850> have<00:05:19.910> the

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
you can't see because i don't have the

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.580 
you can't see because i don't have the
screen<00:05:20.360> to<00:05:20.840> the<00:05:20.870> bottom<00:05:21.200> but<00:05:21.320> you<00:05:21.380> can<00:05:21.500> see

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
screen to the bottom but you can see

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.790 
screen to the bottom but you can see
that<00:05:21.710> this<00:05:21.830> is<00:05:21.979> on<00:05:22.130> 100<00:05:22.630> frames<00:05:23.680> what<00:05:24.680> I've

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
that this is on 100 frames what I've

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.940 
that this is on 100 frames what I've
done<00:05:25.040> and<00:05:25.340> what<00:05:25.669> you<00:05:25.850> will<00:05:26.000> have<00:05:26.210> to<00:05:26.360> do<00:05:26.540> is

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:26.950 
done and what you will have to do is

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.800 
done and what you will have to do is
this<00:05:27.950> all<00:05:28.220> three<00:05:28.880> of<00:05:28.910> these<00:05:29.060> files<00:05:29.300> the<00:05:29.540> test

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
this all three of these files the test

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.540 
this all three of these files the test
test2<00:05:30.350> and<00:05:30.380> test3<00:05:30.650> are<00:05:30.950> actually<00:05:31.370> the<00:05:31.520> same

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
test2 and test3 are actually the same

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.480 
test2 and test3 are actually the same
file<00:05:32.060> just<00:05:32.750> with<00:05:32.960> different<00:05:33.080> names<00:05:33.410> and<00:05:33.680> the

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
file just with different names and the

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.350 
file just with different names and the
reason<00:05:34.820> why<00:05:34.910> I<00:05:34.970> did<00:05:35.210> that<00:05:35.240> is<00:05:35.570> because<00:05:37.360> batch

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
reason why I did that is because batch

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.330 
reason why I did that is because batch
pro<00:05:38.720> is<00:05:38.960> going<00:05:39.290> to<00:05:39.380> use<00:05:39.530> the<00:05:39.680> name<00:05:39.830> of<00:05:39.890> the<00:05:40.070> file

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
pro is going to use the name of the file

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.790 
pro is going to use the name of the file
to<00:05:40.729> render<00:05:41.030> out<00:05:41.150> the<00:05:41.270> images<00:05:41.410> so<00:05:42.410> if<00:05:42.650> you're

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
to render out the images so if you're

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.980 
to render out the images so if you're
rendering<00:05:43.300> multiple<00:05:44.300> times<00:05:44.510> from<00:05:44.660> the<00:05:44.810> same

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
rendering multiple times from the same

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.250 
rendering multiple times from the same
file<00:05:45.320> you're<00:05:46.160> going<00:05:46.280> to<00:05:46.370> render<00:05:46.550> out<00:05:46.930> say<00:05:47.930> and

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 
file you're going to render out say and

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.560 
file you're going to render out say and
your<00:05:49.190> file<00:05:49.430> format<00:05:49.850> is<00:05:49.970> the<00:05:50.000> same<00:05:50.270> let's<00:05:50.479> say

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:50.570 
your file format is the same let's say

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.030 
your file format is the same let's say
you<00:05:50.630> decided<00:05:51.080> you<00:05:51.169> wanted<00:05:51.200> multiple<00:05:51.830> rent

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:52.040 
you decided you wanted multiple rent

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.190 
you decided you wanted multiple rent
multiple<00:05:52.520> PNG<00:05:52.910> renders<00:05:53.270> of<00:05:53.479> the<00:05:53.690> same<00:05:53.900> file

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:54.200 
multiple PNG renders of the same file

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.570 
multiple PNG renders of the same file
but<00:05:54.680> you're<00:05:54.830> just<00:05:54.979> using<00:05:55.130> different

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
but you're just using different

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.610 
but you're just using different
different<00:05:55.910> frame<00:05:56.600> ranges<00:05:57.050> you<00:05:57.169> know<00:05:57.290> first

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620 
different frame ranges you know first

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.440 
different frame ranges you know first
one<00:05:57.830> is<00:05:57.919> 12<00:05:58.430> 30<00:05:58.610> just<00:05:58.820> like<00:05:58.940> we<00:05:59.060> did<00:05:59.180> here

00:05:59.440 --> 00:05:59.450 
one is 12 30 just like we did here

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:01.630 
one is 12 30 just like we did here
second<00:06:00.169> one<00:06:00.260> is<00:06:00.350> 31<00:06:00.710> to<00:06:00.800> 60<00:06:01.040> and<00:06:01.280> so<00:06:01.370> on<00:06:01.490> and<00:06:01.580> so

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:01.640 
second one is 31 to 60 and so on and so

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.510 
second one is 31 to 60 and so on and so
forth<00:06:02.470> you're<00:06:03.470> going<00:06:03.620> to<00:06:03.680> end<00:06:03.800> up<00:06:03.950> over

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 
forth you're going to end up over

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.120 
forth you're going to end up over
writing<00:06:05.590> you've<00:06:06.590> run<00:06:06.740> the<00:06:06.860> risk<00:06:07.039> of

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:07.130 
writing you've run the risk of

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:09.820 
writing you've run the risk of
overriding<00:06:07.729> your<00:06:07.910> of<00:06:08.210> files<00:06:08.630> which<00:06:09.560> is<00:06:09.590> why

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:09.830 
overriding your of files which is why

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.439 
overriding your of files which is why
even<00:06:10.400> if<00:06:10.490> you're<00:06:10.640> using<00:06:10.880> this<00:06:11.120> same

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:11.449 
even if you're using this same

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:14.350 
even if you're using this same
main<00:06:11.569> pz3<00:06:12.289> the<00:06:12.919> same<00:06:13.099> polls<00:06:13.370> are<00:06:13.490> seen<00:06:13.699> you're

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360 
main pz3 the same polls are seen you're

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.239 
main pz3 the same polls are seen you're
going<00:06:14.659> to<00:06:14.749> save<00:06:15.020> it<00:06:15.050> multiple<00:06:15.710> times<00:06:15.770> if

00:06:16.239 --> 00:06:16.249 
going to save it multiple times if

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:18.489 
going to save it multiple times if

00:06:51.979 --> 00:07:00.189 
files and as you can see that this is a
JPEG<00:06:52.699> file<00:06:53.029> at<00:06:53.569> a<00:06:53.629> hundred<00:06:53.990> percent<00:06:54.379> and<00:06:59.199> here

is the this is the PNG file and at the
bottom<00:07:08.749> we<00:07:09.139> should<00:07:09.770> see<00:07:09.919> the<00:07:10.039> flash<00:07:10.309> file<00:07:11.830> that

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:12.830 
bottom we should see the flash file that

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:16.510 
bottom we should see the flash file that
has<00:07:13.009> the<00:07:13.039> remaining<00:07:13.610> 30<00:07:13.849> frames<00:07:15.310> so<00:07:16.310> as<00:07:16.430> you

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:16.520 
has the remaining 30 frames so as you

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.429 
has the remaining 30 frames so as you
can<00:07:16.610> see<00:07:16.729> batch<00:07:16.969> Pro<00:07:17.300> proposed<00:07:17.930> is<00:07:18.139> a<00:07:18.169> very

00:07:18.429 --> 00:07:18.439 
can see batch Pro proposed is a very

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:20.860 
can see batch Pro proposed is a very
easy<00:07:18.649> tool<00:07:18.919> once<00:07:19.189> again<00:07:19.490> the<00:07:20.060> image<00:07:20.330> files<00:07:20.569> or

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:20.870 
easy tool once again the image files or

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.439 
easy tool once again the image files or
the<00:07:20.990> SWF<00:07:21.439> file<00:07:21.620> will<00:07:21.889> be<00:07:21.919> rendered<00:07:22.430> and<00:07:22.610> saved

00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:23.449 
the SWF file will be rendered and saved

00:07:23.449 --> 00:07:26.860 
the SWF file will be rendered and saved
it<00:07:23.659> within<00:07:23.990> the<00:07:24.229> same<00:07:24.589> folder<00:07:25.539> that<00:07:26.539> your
