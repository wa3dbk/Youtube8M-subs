00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.439
 the water system as a rule 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.330
 two straight lines that are perpendicular do not 

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:11.330
 they present perpendiculars in their 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:14.570
 projections the perpendicularity not 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:17.000
 is projected or not represented 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.340
 in the projection planes except for cases 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.950
 particular as they can be straight 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.020
 parallel to the projection planes in 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.570
 this case as you see we have a straight s 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.750
 which is parallel to the horizontal plane of 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:33.050
 projection and the r line is clear that 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.760
 is perpendicular because we see that it is 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.760
 the particular in the projection 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.850
 horizontal in this particular case what 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:44.270
 we see we see that it is perpendicular thanks 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:47.420
 to which the line s is parallel to the plane 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:50.090
 horizontal projection but no 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.440
 we could see it clearly nor can we 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.320
 conclude that those two lines are 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.050
 perpendicular but in the case of 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.750
 planes perpendicular to a straight 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.790
 it will be easier to define if that plan is 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.820
 perpendicular or not to the line since 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.440
 its traces and must be perpendicular 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.680
 to the respective projections of the 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:15.250
 straight in this case we are drawing a 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.250
 possible plane perpendicular to the line r 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.860
 and we know that the particular is because 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.670
 its traces are going to be perpendicular to 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.730
 the straight 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.590
 and like the mountain 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.000
 between two lines and one of them is 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.930
 parallel to one of the planes of 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.260
 projection the perpendicularity will be 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.850
 or it will be represented in that plane 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.060
 of projection to which the line is 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.160
 parallel the traces are not straight 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.250
 but they are straight contained in the 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.560
 projection plane with which that 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.420
 condition also remains in them 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.670
 well this is very important that what 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.580
 let's take into account both what we have 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.040
 seen previously the one that remains 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.350
 parallel to the precision planes if 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:04.040
 they appear perpendicular to the straight 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.380
 r since it will be a very procedure 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.880
 common that when they give us a point to 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.920
 determine either a straight line or a 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.680
 plane perpendicular to a line by 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.720
 example r we have to draw first 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.930
 a line parallel to one of the planes 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.120
 of projection and from there draw 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.820
 a plane that is 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.800
 perpendicular to the line will be a 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.290
 most usual procedure and it will be almost 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.300
 the principle as a rule of all 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.040
 the problems of perpendicularity that 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.920
 let's go see anyway 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.680
 depends on what is 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.250
 between this plane we will see it in a 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.750
 next video but if I wanted these 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.569
 forbidden knowledge you had very 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.819
 clear because they are going to be a procedure 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.370
 very common to draw parallel lines to 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.290
 projection plans and subsequently 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.720
 contain said line straight 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.160
 perpendicular to the straight well is the 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.310
 moment we go see others 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.940
 cases so this is all we see each other in 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.940
 the next video
