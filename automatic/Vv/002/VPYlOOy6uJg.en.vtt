throughout his whole song there are

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.140 
throughout his whole song there are
basic<00:01:03.570> subjects<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.710> concepts<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.640> should

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
basic subjects and concepts that should

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.550 
basic subjects and concepts that should
be<00:01:06.270> taught<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.689> all<00:01:06.810> children<00:01:07.049> because<00:01:07.439> we

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
be taught to all children because we

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.800 
be taught to all children because we
don't<00:01:07.890> know<00:01:08.130> what<00:01:08.369> all<00:01:08.549> children<00:01:09.420> are<00:01:09.540> going

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
don't know what all children are going

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.870

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
to do with the rest of their lives and

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.250 
to do with the rest of their lives and
whether<00:01:12.299> or<00:01:12.390> not<00:01:12.450> they're<00:01:12.659> going<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.990> choose

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
whether or not they're going to choose

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.320 
whether or not they're going to choose
to<00:01:13.500> for<00:01:13.680> instance<00:01:13.890> be<00:01:14.220> coders<00:01:14.729> in<00:01:14.939> which<00:01:15.090> case

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
to for instance be coders in which case

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.960 
to for instance be coders in which case
they<00:01:15.720> do<00:01:15.780> need<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.350> learn<00:01:16.500> advanced<00:01:17.430> maths<00:01:17.670> and

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
they do need to learn advanced maths and

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.969 
they do need to learn advanced maths and
they<00:01:18.119> can't<00:01:18.420> just<00:01:18.509> depend<00:01:18.810> upon<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.650> smart

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
they can't just depend upon the smart

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.280 
they can't just depend upon the smart
phone<00:01:20.280> in<00:01:20.580> their<00:01:21.030> pocket<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.630> also<00:01:21.869> think<00:01:22.110> it's

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
phone in their pocket I also think it's

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.840 
phone in their pocket I also think it's
important<00:01:22.680> sometimes<00:01:22.890> for<00:01:23.340> children<00:01:23.700> to

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
important sometimes for children to

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.490 
important sometimes for children to
learn<00:01:23.880> things<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.570> aren't<00:01:24.900> practically

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
learn things that aren't practically

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.679 
learn things that aren't practically
useful<00:01:25.860> because<00:01:26.670> children<00:01:27.150> don't<00:01:27.390> know<00:01:27.540> what

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
useful because children don't know what

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.980 
useful because children don't know what
they<00:01:27.810> want<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.290> children<00:01:29.329> sometimes<00:01:30.329> want

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
they want and children sometimes want

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.780 
they want and children sometimes want
things<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.409> are<00:01:31.530> only<00:01:31.770> pleasurable<00:01:32.400> instead

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
things that are only pleasurable instead

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.640 
things that are only pleasurable instead
of<00:01:32.880> things<00:01:33.090> they<00:01:33.540> need<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.960> work<00:01:34.170> for<00:01:34.470> that

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
of things they need to work for that

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.910 
of things they need to work for that
will<00:01:34.770> benefit<00:01:35.280> them<00:01:35.460> lay<00:01:35.670> later<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.920> very

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
will benefit them lay later and very

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.520 
will benefit them lay later and very
standardized<00:01:38.490> education<00:01:39.079> teaches<00:01:40.079> that<00:01:40.259> and

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
standardized education teaches that and

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.069 
standardized education teaches that and
it<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.770> part<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:42.240> other<00:01:42.840> than<00:01:43.020> that

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
it is a part of that so other than that

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.520 
it is a part of that so other than that
