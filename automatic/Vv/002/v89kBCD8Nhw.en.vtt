00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.250
 Hello dear viewers with you 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.860
 gringo 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.139
 and in this episode of the mouthpieces game we 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.470
 let's see the fight that took place within 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:23.390
 2 companies at the tenth level and on the map 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:28.430
 ruinberg as you can see the main 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:31.830
 mass of our tanks in the form and fifths and 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:34.410
 Objects 268 goes straight to 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.160
 Zelenka and podeshki moves on 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.530
 back line and we go straight directly 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:45.000
 E100 occupies our central street but 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.400
 until it comes to the center and this is due to 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.070
 so that they can easily bite tv with 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.920
 the same brilliant green therefore batchat by 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.110
 the primary behind the light shows that our 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.350
 Opponents also play through Zelenka 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.530
 by the way coupons first if you're up there 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.880
 This they say that 5 this not the first this 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:08.430
 The first and so the batchat lit up showed and 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.530
 still left safely well done what else 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.119
 can say 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.159
 e100 until they advance they have something 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.829
 occupied so we need to move 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.439
 faster across the road on pain 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:20.200
 get a putter but so can we sheer 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.770
 occasion 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:27.759
 therefore we run across and take a position 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:30.219
 About here I took e100 from us also 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.460
 on the main street and in 2 waffles with 

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:34.810
 batchatom we controlled proud and 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.000
 Naturally periodically they will 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.340
 hang them out to the maximum 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.340
 shoot down enemy forces 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:45.189
 match the same does this waffle while 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.610
 still pick up the right moment here we are 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:50.619
 continue to slowly shoot 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.189
 Now the main task is to keep 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:56.619
 position as possible to throw enemies 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:59.409
 and do not receive damage that is 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:02.950
 the main thing even the third is probably higher 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:05.770
 all the rest is important not to lose 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.200
 whose health is not so much 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.530
 if you take into account that ten 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:15.310
 trunks you will shoot and look for pro 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.500
 on the left we look and the object 268 is already 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.860
 quietly catching up to us but all 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.380
 is equal to the modulo if 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.060
 they took from the second line were able to 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.829
 to accept 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:32.650
 E100 quietly pulls up under the center 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:35.620
 and now it's time for our waffles 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.510
 10 levels to defuse the drum because 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.120
 what is e 100 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.659
 It turned out that they go out and need 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.659
 to use it 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.569
 The main thing is to discharge the drum with a maximum 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:56.450
 penetration therefore it is better several times 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:03:00.040
 aim than just shoot 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:05.959
 wasted the drum so targeting 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:08.569
 occupies an important part of the player's life on 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.370
 this fri and so a bunch of just one 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.349
 shot you shoot the whole drum with 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.379
 breaking a mile with one not penetrating me 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:18.109
 known going to recharge in 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:20.659
 this time on little greens is nothing 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:23.359
 happens quietly fired 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:25.340
 while we accept our own, but superiority 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:28.370
 the tank is already on our side and this 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:31.250
 Naturally happy, I became already a little bit 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.379
 they didnâ€™t get out of it 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.900
 further and they already roll back a little bit 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:38.540
 away in a pocket in the site in their 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.519
 queue we continue to occupy the position 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.639
 Maybe someone will say that this 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:45.950
 just standing in one it's waiting for ours 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:48.169
 the wafer is more precisely one in one taken to 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.840
 sorry she took a hit and all on 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:51.040
 myself 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.349
 I understand that I have someone there 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.660
 Highlight in this bushes and shoot 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:58.750
 there already without light so that at least 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:02.830
 I didn't get any damage 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.780
 queue in itself is basically a situation if 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.730
 look at the map then we have 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.870
 the city advanced to their base and 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:13.360
 shines through this line this street which 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.299
 it leads to the base of the enemy we 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:20.260
 We continue to hold the position and wait when 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.919
 same opponent last attempts something 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.550
 to fix 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:27.970
 will throw all the forces in the attack on us on our 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:30.010
 forces on the green of course we will to this 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.520
 ready and in principle expected because 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:35.620
 what if the opponent goes also stand something 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.020
 from the city center which they already 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.540
 completely by the way they gave us e100 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.300
 there will no longer be quietly and not 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.550
 deal with light all of us 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.210
 I also want to supply, so we are looking for 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.850
 some lumbago 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.100
 opportunities to punch and get into it 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.050
 waffle time is getting closer with 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.479
 Batched to shoot off just those 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.849
 tanks that are on the central 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:01.410
 lines on zelenka 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:05.330
 they can be seen there clearly 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:07.979
 the main time to get up and take a position 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:11.849
 further on the green already begins 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:14.340
 preparation for the attack that is, they already 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:16.259
 begin to crush our enemies here like 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.810
 would i keep thunder so back i 'm not leaving 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:20.610
 but the break through went so quickly 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:24.000
 quickly roll back quickly and 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.620
 hiding behind the house to keep the floor 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.240
 necessary even if the technique is not 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:33.690
 freezing is just not an experience and naturally 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.250
 how would skill and training for the future 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.310
 when will the global map 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:42.659
 freeze tanks so better not 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:45.180
 always lose but if the team requires 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:47.729
 the commander asked to be picked up by someone 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:51.180
 there you can sacrifice yourself 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:53.280
 in addition to the teams commander should be more 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.360
 some kind of individual savvy which 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.469
 naturally 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:00.900
 helps when used correctly 

00:05:57.469 --> 00:06:03.000
 there will no longer be a wolf remains 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:06.930
 just get the remaining strength 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.919
 opponent to shoot everyone and in principle 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:13.349
 what we cope with 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:15.990
 so my if you like this 

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:19.379
 tactic by the way than she is good that if 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:22.289
 opponent show in the city 

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:24.689
 Zelenka to shoot the enemy forces and 

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:26.969
 further part of shaaban capture enemy 

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:30.029
 base part would return our development 

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:32.189
 the press if the opponent is rashid city 90 

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:33.180
 percent of the case the game is through capture then 

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:35.490
 there is nothing more 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.770
 if on zelenka then you yourself saw that 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.490
 going on here on this i'm with you 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.159
 say goodbye 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:45.500
 after you can see the results 

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:45.500
 thank you all for watching
