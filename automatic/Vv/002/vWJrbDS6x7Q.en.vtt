00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
specific thing one could do which would

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.990 
specific thing one could do which would

which would be to cut off Airlines from
South<00:01:11.850> Africa<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.360> could<00:01:12.510> do<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:12.840> but<00:01:13.560> it's

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
South Africa you could do that but it's

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.010

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
Japanese would not a country which

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.039 
Japanese would not a country which
depend<00:01:34.950> so<00:01:35.310> much<00:01:35.340> as<00:01:35.700> Japan<00:01:36.000> does<00:01:36.329> upon<00:01:36.900> its

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
depend so much as Japan does upon its

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
not by any means least in black Africa

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.389 
not by any means least in black Africa
which<00:01:42.390> certainly<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:42.810> don't<00:01:43.020> think<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.500> men

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
which certainly I don't think the men

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.980 
which certainly I don't think the men
will<00:01:44.549> not<00:01:44.700> be<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:44.970> any<00:01:45.090> way<00:01:45.210> anxious<00:01:45.780> to

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
will not be in any way anxious to

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.679 
will not be in any way anxious to
imperil<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.460> last<00:01:47.640> point<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.450> make

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
imperil that and the last point I make

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.929 
imperil that and the last point I make
is<00:01:48.720> in<00:01:49.259> response<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.740> market<00:01:49.890> Portillo<00:01:50.460> says

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
is in response to market Portillo says

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.050 
is in response to market Portillo says
how<00:01:51.659> can<00:01:51.720> we<00:01:52.049> be<00:01:52.229> sure<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:53.340> any<00:01:53.520> measures<00:01:53.909> we

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
how can we be sure that any measures we

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.969 
how can we be sure that any measures we
might<00:01:54.240> take<00:01:54.479> would<00:01:54.750> produce<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.590> desired

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
might take would produce a desired

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.609 
might take would produce a desired
result<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.670> of<00:01:57.299> course<00:01:57.540> unfortunately<00:01:57.780> the

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
result and of course unfortunately the

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.209 
result and of course unfortunately the
answer<00:01:58.740> is<00:01:58.920> we<00:01:59.189> cannot<00:01:59.780> but<00:02:00.780> we<00:02:01.380> must<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.950> think

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
answer is we cannot but we must I think

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.700 
answer is we cannot but we must I think
put<00:02:02.490> pressure<00:02:02.880> on<00:02:03.180> on<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.750> assumption<00:02:04.439> that

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
put pressure on on the assumption that

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.280 
put pressure on on the assumption that
if<00:02:05.189> external<00:02:05.729> pressure<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.119> sufficient<00:02:06.360> it

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
if external pressure is sufficient it

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.550 
if external pressure is sufficient it
