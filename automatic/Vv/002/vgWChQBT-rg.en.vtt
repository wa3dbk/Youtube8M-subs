00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.420
 so hello youtube love a little video 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.210
 here for our beekeepers and ours 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.280
 Beekeeper and she is simple 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:16.619
 a little trick as a small genre 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:19.980
 small box if you are saving foxes subotic 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.449
 money collection as I do and not 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.670
 a lot of money for the agrarian caskets 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.920
 this is a practicable one 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.630
 trick how to do that 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.740
 it is relatively easy to set up 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.630
 have a slightly larger one below 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.969
 flowerpot and one slightly smaller 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.719
 flower pot a lid in the middle and 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.920
 a lid as a roof this whole 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.629
 thought that shows from the top to 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:47.010
 below 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:50.550
 so start under the roof hides 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:54.710
 a small flower pot is only one whole 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.390
 small flowerpot this is considered 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.219
 Food container thought here you can 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.059
 about 1 title kilo feed particle 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.500
 enter and through the hole is the 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.680
 Father's day to do something through the air 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.880
 we did in the second cover 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.070
 sink down and the bees can 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.090
 to get the food 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.350
 right I'm still relatively small 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.330
 made for just a bee 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.650
 that prevents the 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.430
 Bees later start the whole thing 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.450
 expand above and wax with them 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.580
 otherwise learn that make the bigger 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.670
 to be raised by bees and that 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.409
 he is not ideal 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.799
 she'll never make enough stupid things in 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.960
 such a dwelling including a second 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.520
 lid with a small hole where we 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.740
 that will leak through it 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.720
 the growth is due to dough dough 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.649
 ought to leak 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:48.270
 and among these is the dwelling where 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:50.189
 we will keep our bees everything 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.049
 They will win relatively easily 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.649
 will also do wild building here 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.990
 Do not make us illusions but around the 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.240
 wiener direction so far to travel 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.439
 we just have a few here at the beginning 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.159
 stripe similar to what a tv wanted 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:12.819
 on 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:14.140
 made wood ducks and have the bees 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.269
 a certain direction where she goes 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.500
 can build little trick cuts that 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.440
 change the initial stripes designed 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:24.069
 she oddly has the advantage that how 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.640
 in the tbh the bees almost wanted 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:30.180
 Not all of us at all 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.049
 stripes are growing and thereby 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.269
 the easier it will be later 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.500
 see they are already around the 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.500
 Simply, we create a lot of 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.599
 Feldbau make the launch of this 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.049
 It is important that the method is simple 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:45.819
 we can check later if the 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.190
 Queen of the situation according to the young 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.310
 Unfortunately, the queen has gone and for that 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.150
 is it necessary for us to do this 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:57.370
 have removable initial strips 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:59.319
 hoppala because we can do it that way 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.840
 take out and if the bees here 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:06.750
 we could have expanded the 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:08.890
 altogether 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.599
 make several videos of this is 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.880
 only once the boarding as 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.380
 the system does explain how the flight hole is explained 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.359
 on your own and in each youth meeting 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.120
 is a small hole as a loophole 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:21.730
 ideal one puts on two of these wood 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.980
 flakes and ready to take the bees 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.060
 very good now 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:29.049
 the whole thing will be filled later 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.310
 about 150 grams bees female worker the 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:33.700
 are quite enough like this little one 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.959
 system and it is not permanent 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.200
 outside really should only be considered as 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:41.049
 advice kesting thought or as a camp 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.060
 for beekeepers who are some queen for 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.620
 autumn want to outsource 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.560
 you can see the bees through the whole 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.970
 summer into maintain the queen bee 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.090
 she will accept it very well there 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.470
 There is no question 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.769
 yes that's all there is to it 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.069
 the days will be how far my services 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.569
 are 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:04.720
 If I 'm looking for the queen already 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:05.889
 get started and then I'll show how 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.720
 the whole thing looks like when I do that 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:09.910
 Settled and I will come later 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.079
 make another video where you can see how 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.030
 I check if the cancellation 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:14.620
 already it was about queen 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.840
 and make a few videos you 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.100
 this given that I can see exactly 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.930
 I just started early because yes, too 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.150
 even if you are in the emergency time 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.430
 and you have no skipchens 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.590
 for about 250 such can 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.759
 consulting costs city to finish off 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:32.470
 the panel just a few market 

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:34.389
 get flower pots whatever you do 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.860
 can you can here to purchased 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:38.800
 orphan girl hanging in 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.539
 that is not a problem I personally from 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.880
 several of my bees are 80 percent over 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:44.110
 was black all I kill so the 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.509
 black does not cut off but cuts 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.169
 Out and hang in here 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:48.669
 Of course, now for some 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:50.350
 Discussions worry why note times 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:51.539
 I have very good experiences 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:56.080
 one terminates the ones from black 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:58.150
 and the old beekeeping opinion that out 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.550
 I can not handle black sea heavy 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.620
 share my bees are 80 percent 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:06.509
 black tail tailed my 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:09.699
 Queen and do not rave about that 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:11.199
 Queen of other beekeepers colleagues 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:12.490
 You do not have to go black everywhere immediately 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:14.320
 you can also destroy yourself easily 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.639
 let so intense kettle hatch 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.320
 let them accompany you 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:21.070
 and if the queen is in a position 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:22.660
 to start a new people with it 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.580
 All children beekeeper interesting for all 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:29.080
 who do not try to rotate the 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:33.599
 yes, this is how the system works 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.599
 it looks that together again 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:40.590
 up in this case simply the 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.590
 replace the lid 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:49.980
 under good conditions still on the hole 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:51.420
 roof put on and easy later a 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.280
 Place the stone to complain since it 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.690
 does not fall over 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.670
 the way it looks in action I will 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:59.700
 show you in the next few weeks if 

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:03.680
 I start to breed a queen 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.680
 Goodbye
