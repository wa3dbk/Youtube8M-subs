that<00:02:29.219> they<00:02:29.459> include<00:02:29.879> this<00:02:31.159> even<00:02:32.159> though

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
that they include this even though

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.330 
that they include this even though
Laserbeak<00:02:32.939> hasn't<00:02:33.359> made<00:02:33.510> an<00:02:33.719> appearance<00:02:34.049> yet

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
Laserbeak hasn't made an appearance yet

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.059 
Laserbeak hasn't made an appearance yet
is<00:02:35.340> phenomenal<00:02:35.939> it<00:02:36.750> does<00:02:37.019> clip<00:02:37.290> on<00:02:37.469> so<00:02:37.859> he

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
is phenomenal it does clip on so he

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.979 
is phenomenal it does clip on so he
could<00:02:38.370> laser<00:02:38.939> be<00:02:39.180> could<00:02:39.420> right<00:02:39.629> around<00:02:39.840> like

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
could laser be could right around like

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.470 
could laser be could right around like
this<00:02:40.200> and<00:02:42.170> so<00:02:43.250> that's<00:02:44.250> it<00:02:44.459> for<00:02:44.639> that<00:02:44.819> as<00:02:45.180> you

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
this and so that's it for that as you

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.170 
this and so that's it for that as you
can<00:02:45.659> see<00:02:45.810> like<00:02:45.959> I<00:02:46.079> said<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.560> Scion<00:02:47.180> something

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
can see like I said the Scion something

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.360 
can see like I said the Scion something
or<00:02:48.269> other<00:02:48.450> whatever<00:02:49.349> it<00:02:49.560> is<00:02:49.650> I<00:02:49.950> don't<00:02:50.010> know<00:02:50.159> but

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
or other whatever it is I don't know but

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.619 
or other whatever it is I don't know but
I'm<00:02:50.489> sure<00:02:50.639> somebody<00:02:50.909> is<00:02:51.120> going<00:02:51.299> to<00:02:51.420> tell<00:02:51.599> me

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
I'm sure somebody is going to tell me

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.479 
I'm sure somebody is going to tell me
making<00:02:52.620> me<00:02:52.709> feel<00:02:52.829> like<00:02:53.010> a<00:02:53.040> moron

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
making me feel like a moron

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:58.599 
making me feel like a moron
I<00:02:53.700> really<00:02:54.569> like<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:56.010> coloring<00:02:56.549> like<00:02:56.939> this

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:58.609 
I really like the the coloring like this

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:04.129 
I really like the the coloring like this
it'll<00:02:59.609> be<00:02:59.669> hard<00:03:00.030> to<00:03:00.180> see<00:03:00.389> but<00:03:00.680> it<00:03:01.680> close<00:03:03.049> yes<00:03:04.049> I

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:04.139 
it'll be hard to see but it close yes I

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:07.390 
it'll be hard to see but it close yes I
think<00:03:04.260> you're<00:03:04.379> close<00:03:04.560> if<00:03:05.069> it<00:03:05.250> does<00:03:05.459> not<00:03:05.639> grow

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
think you're close if it does not grow

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.339 
think you're close if it does not grow
it's<00:03:08.400> at<00:03:08.489> least<00:03:08.579> extremely<00:03:08.879> reflective<00:03:09.480> I'm

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
it's at least extremely reflective I'm

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.229 
it's at least extremely reflective I'm
trying<00:03:10.590> to<00:03:10.680> see<00:03:10.889> if<00:03:11.280> I<00:03:11.400> can<00:03:11.549> pick<00:03:11.730> it<00:03:11.879> up<00:03:11.969> but

take this section and separate that and
I<00:04:00.060> just<00:04:00.120> nice<00:04:00.650> Laserbeak<00:04:01.650> down<00:04:01.949> so<00:04:02.849> when<00:04:03.030> you

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
I just nice Laserbeak down so when you

I just nice Laserbeak down so when you
have<00:04:03.299> it<00:04:03.329> separated<00:04:03.989> like<00:04:04.169> that<00:04:04.379> then<00:04:04.680> you<00:04:04.799> can

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:04.949 
have it separated like that then you can

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:07.009 
have it separated like that then you can
really<00:04:05.310> get<00:04:05.459> in<00:04:05.579> there<00:04:05.729> get<00:04:06.299> the<00:04:06.449> arms<00:04:06.810> just

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
really get in there get the arms just

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.170 
really get in there get the arms just
kind<00:04:07.470> of<00:04:07.530> extend<00:04:07.919> those<00:04:08.040> out<00:04:08.250> go<00:04:08.849> ahead<00:04:08.909> and<00:04:09.090> do

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
kind of extend those out go ahead and do

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.670 
kind of extend those out go ahead and do
that<00:04:09.209> on<00:04:09.359> both<00:04:09.750> sides

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.190 

come<00:04:13.680> around<00:04:13.800> here<00:04:14.040> to<00:04:14.070> the<00:04:14.160> bottom<00:04:14.990> you<00:04:15.990> want

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
come around here to the bottom you want

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.220 
come around here to the bottom you want
to<00:04:16.440> then<00:04:17.130> spread<00:04:17.700> these<00:04:17.880> out<00:04:18.180> and<00:04:18.480> they<00:04:19.109> will

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
to then spread these out and they will

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:25.490 
to then spread these out and they will
fold<00:04:19.470> down<00:04:21.800> just<00:04:22.800> like<00:04:22.980> so<00:04:23.220> and<00:04:24.200> now<00:04:25.200> you<00:04:25.260> have
