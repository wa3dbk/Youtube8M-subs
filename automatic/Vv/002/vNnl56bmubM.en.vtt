actually the unique part about it is of
course<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.549> keeps<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.240> weight<00:01:45.390> low<00:01:45.659> and

distributes it evenly across the frame
that's<00:01:47.909> what<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.149> want<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.420> do<00:01:48.600> if<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.320> if

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
that's what you want to do if you if

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.050 
that's what you want to do if you if
you've<00:01:49.680> got<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.860> purpose-built<00:01:50.250> electric<00:01:50.880> bike

like this the downside to it though is

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.840 
like this the downside to it though is
that<00:01:53.909> you'll<00:01:54.420> notice<00:01:54.570> here<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.500> key<00:01:55.860> has<00:01:56.820> to

want<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.430> kick<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:02.909> could<00:02:03.060> damage<00:02:03.240> it

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
want to kick it you could damage it

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.440 
want to kick it you could damage it
that's<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.829> charging<00:02:05.280> port<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.790> on<00:02:06.329> the

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
that's the charging port and on the

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.309 
that's the charging port and on the
underside<00:02:07.110> there's<00:02:07.920> another<00:02:08.369> keyhole

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
underside there's another keyhole

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.319 
underside there's another keyhole
and<00:02:09.439> and<00:02:09.829> you<00:02:10.099> have<00:02:10.249> to<00:02:10.340> unlock<00:02:10.700> it<00:02:10.939> to<00:02:11.120> pull

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:11.329 
and and you have to unlock it to pull

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:13.750 
and and you have to unlock it to pull
the<00:02:11.420> battery<00:02:11.689> out<00:02:11.780> so<00:02:12.109> technically<00:02:13.010> this<00:02:13.519> has

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
the battery out so technically this has

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.280 
the battery out so technically this has
a<00:02:13.790> removable<00:02:14.060> battery<00:02:14.659> so<00:02:14.900> you<00:02:14.989> could<00:02:15.109> charge

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
a removable battery so you could charge

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.709 
a removable battery so you could charge
at<00:02:15.469> work<00:02:15.650> but<00:02:15.859> I<00:02:16.129> think<00:02:16.549> in<00:02:16.670> practice<00:02:17.180> it's

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:17.719 
at work but I think in practice it's

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:18.940 
at work but I think in practice it's
really<00:02:17.930> not<00:02:18.079> going<00:02:18.230> to<00:02:18.290> work<00:02:18.499> that<00:02:18.530> well

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
really not going to work that well

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.000 
really not going to work that well
because<00:02:19.609> it's<00:02:19.819> just<00:02:19.879> not<00:02:20.060> very<00:02:20.299> convenient<00:02:21.010> so

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
because it's just not very convenient so

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.899 
because it's just not very convenient so
that's<00:02:22.219> a<00:02:22.459> little<00:02:22.790> bit<00:02:22.939> of<00:02:23.030> a<00:02:23.150> bummer<00:02:23.769> also

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:24.909 
that's a little bit of a bummer also

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.369 
that's a little bit of a bummer also
controlling<00:02:25.909> that<00:02:26.150> is<00:02:26.299> this<00:02:26.450> you<00:02:27.049> know<00:02:27.139> you've

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
controlling that is this you know you've

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:29.589 
controlling that is this you know you've
got<00:02:27.469> a<00:02:27.530> nice<00:02:27.709> computer<00:02:28.129> LCD<00:02:28.519> screen<00:02:29.180> set<00:02:29.450> up

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
got a nice computer LCD screen set up

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.559 
got a nice computer LCD screen set up
three<00:02:30.290> levels<00:02:30.620> of<00:02:30.739> assist<00:02:31.189> shows<00:02:32.030> your<00:02:32.209> speed

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
three levels of assist shows your speed

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.429 
three levels of assist shows your speed
your<00:02:32.989> distance<00:02:34.719> more<00:02:35.719> precise<00:02:36.079> battery

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:36.439 
your distance more precise battery

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:38.409 
your distance more precise battery
capacity<00:02:37.010> than<00:02:37.219> if<00:02:37.310> it<00:02:37.370> were<00:02:37.489> just<00:02:37.669> LEDs<00:02:38.150> which

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:38.419 
capacity than if it were just LEDs which

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:40.239 
capacity than if it were just LEDs which
is<00:02:38.569> nice<00:02:38.749> and<00:02:39.019> they've<00:02:39.590> got<00:02:39.620> a<00:02:39.739> break<00:02:40.010> outs

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:40.249 
is nice and they've got a break outs

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:42.909 
is nice and they've got a break outs
which<00:02:40.579> console<00:02:41.359> here<00:02:41.540> where<00:02:41.689> you<00:02:41.810> can<00:02:41.989> kind<00:02:42.650> of

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:42.919 
which console here where you can kind of

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:44.110 
which console here where you can kind of
reach<00:02:43.159> it<00:02:43.430> you<00:02:43.459> know<00:02:43.700> when<00:02:43.819> you're<00:02:43.939> pedaling

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
reach it you know when you're pedaling

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.050 
reach it you know when you're pedaling
turn<00:02:44.959> it<00:02:45.109> on<00:02:45.200> change<00:02:45.799> the<00:02:46.040> pedal<00:02:46.340> assist<00:02:46.609> level

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
turn it on change the pedal assist level

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.439 
turn it on change the pedal assist level
that's<00:02:48.049> that's<00:02:48.439> great<00:02:48.919> but<00:02:49.639> because<00:02:50.150> of<00:02:50.299> these

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:50.449 
that's that's great but because of these

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:52.300 
that's that's great but because of these
shifters<00:02:50.959> that<00:02:51.169> they're<00:02:51.379> they're<00:02:51.680> using<00:02:52.129> here

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
shifters that they're they're using here

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.369 
shifters that they're they're using here
the<00:02:52.459> trigger<00:02:52.639> shifters<00:02:53.060> it<00:02:53.209> just<00:02:53.719> its<00:02:53.900> paces

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:54.379 
the trigger shifters it just its paces

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:56.470 
the trigger shifters it just its paces
it<00:02:54.530> out<00:02:54.680> so<00:02:54.980> like<00:02:55.340> you<00:02:55.849> know<00:02:55.879> it's<00:02:56.180> hard<00:02:56.329> to

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
it out so like you know it's hard to

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.059 
it out so like you know it's hard to
reach<00:02:56.659> and<00:02:56.930> that's<00:02:57.260> the<00:02:57.469> same<00:02:57.709> with<00:02:57.919> the

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
reach and that's the same with the

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.759 
reach and that's the same with the
throttle<00:02:58.310> here<00:02:58.730> so<00:02:59.150> if<00:02:59.480> you<00:03:00.230> want<00:03:00.439> to<00:03:00.560> use<00:03:00.650> the

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
throttle here so if you want to use the

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.640 
throttle here so if you want to use the
throttle<00:03:01.159> first<00:03:01.489> of<00:03:01.669> all<00:03:01.760> you<00:03:02.030> just<00:03:02.810> you<00:03:03.620> know

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
throttle first of all you just you know

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.439 
throttle first of all you just you know
try<00:03:04.219> to<00:03:04.250> demonstrate<00:03:04.459> this<00:03:04.879> again<00:03:05.150> and<00:03:05.269> kind

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:05.449 
try to demonstrate this again and kind

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:08.470 
try to demonstrate this again and kind
of<00:03:05.510> got<00:03:05.629> a<00:03:05.689> ride<00:03:06.500> in<00:03:06.980> this<00:03:07.189> awkward<00:03:07.849> position

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
of got a ride in this awkward position

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.319 
of got a ride in this awkward position
to<00:03:08.719> reach<00:03:08.930> it<00:03:09.169> and<00:03:09.370> I<00:03:10.370> guess<00:03:10.730> I'm<00:03:10.879> hoping<00:03:11.180> that

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
to reach it and I guess I'm hoping that

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.089 
to reach it and I guess I'm hoping that
they<00:03:11.480> can<00:03:11.510> address<00:03:11.840> that<00:03:11.989> somehow<00:03:12.409> maybe<00:03:12.829> with

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 
they can address that somehow maybe with

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:15.729 
they can address that somehow maybe with
better<00:03:13.909> trigger<00:03:14.479> shifters<00:03:14.930> or<00:03:15.079> something<00:03:15.439> but

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
better trigger shifters or something but

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.379 
better trigger shifters or something but
it<00:03:15.829> does<00:03:15.979> work<00:03:16.280> and<00:03:16.519> it's<00:03:16.879> nice<00:03:17.060> that<00:03:17.090> they've

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389 
it does work and it's nice that they've

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:22.030 
it does work and it's nice that they've
got<00:03:17.569> both<00:03:17.949> pedal<00:03:18.949> assist<00:03:19.189> and<00:03:19.430> a<00:03:20.109> throttle<00:03:21.109> and

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
got both pedal assist and a throttle and

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.920 
got both pedal assist and a throttle and
on<00:03:22.159> the<00:03:22.220> pedal<00:03:22.489> assist<00:03:22.729> on<00:03:22.909> this<00:03:23.030> bike<00:03:23.269> unlike

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
on the pedal assist on this bike unlike

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.170 
on the pedal assist on this bike unlike
the<00:03:24.139> folding<00:03:24.979> epic<00:03:25.400> bikes<00:03:25.609> and<00:03:25.879> some<00:03:25.970> of<00:03:26.060> their

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
the folding epic bikes and some of their

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.999 
the folding epic bikes and some of their
their<00:03:26.449> other<00:03:26.599> bikes<00:03:26.810> it<00:03:27.109> uses<00:03:27.620> a<00:03:27.650> torque

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:28.009 
their other bikes it uses a torque

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:30.699 
their other bikes it uses a torque
sensor<00:03:28.430> back<00:03:28.790> here<00:03:29.090> so<00:03:29.329> however<00:03:30.019> hard<00:03:30.500> you're

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
sensor back here so however hard you're

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.170 
sensor back here so however hard you're
pedaling<00:03:31.220> that's<00:03:31.430> going<00:03:31.639> to<00:03:31.699> send<00:03:31.909> a<00:03:32.000> signal

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
pedaling that's going to send a signal

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.439 
pedaling that's going to send a signal
to<00:03:32.359> the<00:03:32.540> motor<00:03:32.750> to<00:03:33.290> activate<00:03:33.859> more<00:03:34.819> or<00:03:35.060> less

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:35.449 
to the motor to activate more or less

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:36.580 
to the motor to activate more or less
right<00:03:35.750> and<00:03:35.959> so<00:03:36.049> it<00:03:36.139> creates<00:03:36.379> this<00:03:36.500> really

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
right and so it creates this really

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.809 
right and so it creates this really
smooth<00:03:37.220> ride<00:03:37.519> that's<00:03:38.919> just<00:03:39.919> noticeably<00:03:40.639> more

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
smooth ride that's just noticeably more

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:43.599 
smooth ride that's just noticeably more
fluid<00:03:41.389> than<00:03:41.419> the<00:03:42.019> basic<00:03:42.259> pedal<00:03:43.009> X<00:03:43.189> sensor

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609 
fluid than the basic pedal X sensor

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:45.879 
fluid than the basic pedal X sensor
design<00:03:44.239> so<00:03:44.720> that's<00:03:45.169> kind<00:03:45.379> of<00:03:45.439> it<00:03:45.620> you<00:03:45.859> know

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:45.889 
design so that's kind of it you know

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:47.559 
design so that's kind of it you know
there's<00:03:46.189> there's<00:03:46.400> the<00:03:46.579> bike<00:03:46.759> it's<00:03:47.060> got<00:03:47.239> quick

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
there's there's the bike it's got quick

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:49.599 
there's there's the bike it's got quick
release<00:03:47.900> on<00:03:48.109> the<00:03:48.199> front<00:03:48.470> wheel<00:03:48.620> we've<00:03:49.370> got<00:03:49.579> a

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609
