the<00:00:47.300> jungle<00:00:47.750> because<00:00:47.930> his<00:00:48.410> columns<00:00:48.800> are<00:00:48.950> like

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
the jungle because his columns are like

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.940 
the jungle because his columns are like
to<00:00:49.280> hide<00:00:49.489> alion<00:00:50.149> so<00:00:50.420> his<00:00:50.750> time<00:00:51.230> here<00:00:51.680> it's<00:00:51.860> just

about<00:00:52.370> but<00:00:52.789> overall<00:00:53.180> I<00:00:53.239> think<00:00:53.420> this<00:00:53.719> room<00:00:53.899> is

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
about but overall I think this room is

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:02.229 
about but overall I think this room is
so<00:00:54.140> broken<00:00:54.910> any<00:00:55.910> other<00:00:56.090> opinions<00:00:57.640> yeah<00:01:00.489> I<00:01:01.489> see

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
so broken any other opinions yeah I see

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.060 
so broken any other opinions yeah I see
anything<00:01:02.600> a<00:01:02.750> new<00:01:03.020> plug-in<00:01:03.289> you've<00:01:03.739> talked
