 immediately to the roar of the engine that with the 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.120
 time becomes a pleasant 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:39.620
 background sound that accompanies us during 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.620
 all our tour 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.519
 optically he is more angular and the 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.690

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.259
 that really matters and is spectacular 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:19.570
 is what happens under the hood the new 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:22.420
