then the eighth doctors head fits snugly
in<00:05:24.930> place<00:05:26.449> so<00:05:27.449> this<00:05:27.660> is<00:05:27.810> an<00:05:27.900> interesting

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
in place so this is an interesting

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.180 
in place so this is an interesting
variant<00:05:28.979> based<00:05:29.370> on<00:05:29.610> well<00:05:30.330> nothing<00:05:31.169> at<00:05:31.260> all<00:05:31.410> but

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
variant based on well nothing at all but

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:33.409 
variant based on well nothing at all but
like<00:05:32.400> I<00:05:32.550> said<00:05:32.610> it's<00:05:32.940> nice<00:05:33.060> to<00:05:33.240> have<00:05:33.389> a

different<00:05:33.840> head<00:05:34.020> for<00:05:34.200> the<00:05:34.260> eighth<00:05:34.350> doctor

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:34.919 
different head for the eighth doctor

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:37.370 
different head for the eighth doctor
it's<00:05:35.729> a<00:05:35.820> pretty<00:05:36.000> good<00:05:36.210> likeness<00:05:36.360> for<00:05:36.960> an<00:05:37.020> older

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
it's a pretty good likeness for an older

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:15.570 
larger plug of this body I tried the TV

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.360 
larger plug of this body I tried the TV
movie<00:06:15.750> version<00:06:16.320> I<00:06:16.440> even<00:06:16.680> tried<00:06:16.889> the<00:06:17.070> comic

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:17.370 
movie version I even tried the comic

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.850 
movie version I even tried the comic
book<00:06:17.520> version<00:06:17.550> and<00:06:18.090> sadly<00:06:18.900> the<00:06:19.349> pegs<00:06:19.620> are<00:06:19.770> the

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 
book version and sadly the pegs are the

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.490 
book version and sadly the pegs are the
same<00:06:20.070> so<00:06:20.610> you<00:06:20.700> will<00:06:20.820> not<00:06:21.000> be<00:06:21.150> able<00:06:21.270> to<00:06:21.450> fit<00:06:21.810> this

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:22.500 
same so you will not be able to fit this

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.589 
same so you will not be able to fit this
head<00:06:22.800> on<00:06:23.010> to<00:06:23.099> that<00:06:23.250> body<00:06:23.490> without<00:06:24.240> a<00:06:24.450> bit<00:06:24.570> of

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:24.599 
head on to that body without a bit of

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:27.020 
head on to that body without a bit of
customizing<00:06:25.320> so<00:06:26.220> there's<00:06:26.370> probably<00:06:26.550> a<00:06:26.789> bit

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:27.030 
customizing so there's probably a bit

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:28.670 
customizing so there's probably a bit
annoying<00:06:27.360> for<00:06:27.720> anyone<00:06:28.020> who<00:06:28.139> is<00:06:28.289> planning<00:06:28.620> a
