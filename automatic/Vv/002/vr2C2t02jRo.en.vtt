00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.830 

before<00:00:59.850> we<00:00:59.940> thinking<00:01:00.240> what<00:01:00.480> do<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.600> mean<00:01:00.780> you

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
before we thinking what do you mean you

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.010 
before we thinking what do you mean you
don't<00:01:00.960> know<00:01:02.210> all<00:01:03.210> right<00:01:03.360> you<00:01:03.570> can<00:01:03.600> figure<00:01:03.900> that

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:04.020 
don't know all right you can figure that

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:08.720 
don't know all right you can figure that
out<00:01:04.970> um<00:01:06.410> basically<00:01:07.410> if<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:08.040> miss<00:01:08.310> something

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:08.730 
out um basically if I miss something

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:16.450 
out um basically if I miss something
that<00:01:08.880> ups<00:01:09.030> intentional<00:01:09.630> otherwise<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.470> wasn't

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:26.770 

probably<00:01:17.460> wasn't<00:01:17.820> unclear<00:01:18.180> brother

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.020 

um

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.440 

you<00:01:30.570> can<00:01:30.720> notice<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:31.020> sound<00:01:31.799> problem<00:01:32.369> where<00:01:33.330> I

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
you can notice a sound problem where I

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:40.010 
you can notice a sound problem where I
fix<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.710> in<00:01:35.040> future<00:01:35.820> part<00:01:36.240> ah<00:01:36.540> mr.<00:01:38.780> we<00:01:39.780> can

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
fix that in future part ah mr. we can

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:50.730 
fix that in future part ah mr. we can
reduce<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.530> level<00:01:40.890> that<00:01:41.610> way<00:01:41.880> yeah

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.970 

um

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.580 

so<00:01:55.760> let's<00:01:56.060> collect<00:01:56.300> all<00:01:56.480> the<00:01:56.600> gears<00:01:56.840> now<00:01:57.410> in

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
so let's collect all the gears now in

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.920 
so let's collect all the gears now in
this<00:01:57.740> room<00:01:57.950> the<00:01:58.130> camera<00:01:58.550> angle<00:01:58.930> completely

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
this room the camera angle completely

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.130 
this room the camera angle completely
messes<00:02:00.260> up<00:02:01.150> just<00:02:02.150> kind<00:02:02.330> of<00:02:02.420> really<00:02:02.720> control<00:02:03.110> it

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
messes up just kind of really control it

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.410 
messes up just kind of really control it
as<00:02:03.470> soon<00:02:03.650> as<00:02:03.770> you<00:02:03.860> start<00:02:04.070> walking<00:02:04.310> it<00:02:04.730> it<00:02:05.060> moves

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
as soon as you start walking it it moves

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.290 
as soon as you start walking it it moves
the<00:02:05.600> self<00:02:05.960> back<00:02:06.230> into<00:02:06.260> the<00:02:06.710> bad<00:02:06.920> position<00:02:07.490> so

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
the self back into the bad position so

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.180 
the self back into the bad position so
you<00:02:08.390> can't<00:02:08.600> see<00:02:08.780> anything<00:02:09.020> ah<00:02:11.020> well<00:02:12.020> the<00:02:13.010> drug

levels will lose a lot more in this than
any<00:03:14.040> other<00:03:14.250> level<00:03:14.550> because<00:03:14.910> as<00:03:15.630> soon<00:03:15.840> as<00:03:16.019> one

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
any other level because as soon as one

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.180 
any other level because as soon as one

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:54.890 

and<00:03:36.650> how<00:03:37.650> awkward<00:03:37.950> is<00:03:38.250> that

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:09.320 

are<00:03:55.900> these<00:03:56.050> games<00:03:56.350> very<00:03:56.710> underrated

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.260 

and<00:04:09.450> there<00:04:10.290> are<00:04:10.440> no<00:04:10.620> people<00:04:11.070> who<00:04:11.760> are<00:04:11.970> in<00:04:12.150> the

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
wrong world and it's level because if

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.560 
wrong world and it's level because if
there<00:04:14.280> was<00:04:14.520> then<00:04:15.420> every<00:04:15.780> very<00:04:15.990> weird<00:04:17.570> because
