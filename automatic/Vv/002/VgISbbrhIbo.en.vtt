00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:05.720
 I saw people bringing that to you 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:51.440
 you can see that he had done it 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:55.129
 here it will take a lot will have a read 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:59.239
 here the executive 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:16.159
 enjoy is very simple to use 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:37.079
 so the df waits for 5 seconds of 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:42.810
 I'm not recording with opel 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:47.850
 this rock monitoring happens when 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:50.310
 I am recording with this mode to monitor the 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.189
 that you can see that it has an even bigger 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.920
 that I have when I'm recording with 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.439
 he I open combat arms is or any 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.299
 another game he buga buga and I have to 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.420
 initial realize why he gives a sword 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:06.750
 wolf and it kept blinking that it had screen 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:10.200
 so it's trustworthy so I 've read it 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.690
 look here no threats have been 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.530
 detected and without saying that bad good too 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.720
 and so it's the one here you did not have 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.810
 red sign or charge for the game 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:25.890
 here at oscar it's very bad professional 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:41.510
 well we 've always used them to sack them and 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:41.510
 It's just that 's a lot and that's it.
