 that were enough to create each one 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.700
 of these 94 designs because we focus 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.860
 a lot in the tastes of women 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.650
 Mexicans clearly the brand is global 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.240

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.710
 mother the same campaign but here in 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.230
 Mexico, we wanted to tropicalize then 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.510
 we focus on local tastes by 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.820
 example for a younger woman more 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.160
 hipster we are having our glasses 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:31.140

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.140
 shot different videos 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.480
 a different way of being for a 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.720
 more woman 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.540
 more adult or more as we would have to 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.790
 be more classic darker models 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.610
 for a woman who wants a style of 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.400
 lifetime we have our icons as 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.379
 the aviators uruguay put the 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.900
 elephants revisited with our 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:56.959
 new of our new micas the 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.450
 novelty that we have now is to play with 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:02.239
 the materials then they can find 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.180
 the mosaic of dolce gabbana the stones 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.590
 of prada and this is an anticipation of 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.310
 what we are going to have also in the 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.310
 next sales 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.340
 if you had to choose a style for 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.080
 you something that stays with your personality and 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:22.220
 with your way of being 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:23.770
 this is like the 94 of this campaign 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.740
 all why 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.610
 really every day you wake up with a 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.650
 crown 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.870
 with a different energy if I explain myself 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.820
 then as your bag I'm going I want to put 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.580
 mind and it 's the same with lenses today 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:41.050
 I want to put on is definitely my way 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:45.240
 favorite is more like qatar 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.240

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.760
 here 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:56.410
 I think this event is full of 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.379
 true that a lot of good vibes we see from 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.000

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:02.830
 tell us what they were based on to create 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.989
 all this concept because if the event that 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.090
 we are having today reflects the campaign 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:10.230
