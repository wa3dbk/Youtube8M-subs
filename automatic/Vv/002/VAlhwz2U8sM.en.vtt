green so I opened up the cage to have a
look<00:02:03.520> at<00:02:03.610> him<00:02:03.759> and<00:02:04.060> he<00:02:04.600> wasn't<00:02:04.780> breathing<00:02:04.990> very

scratchy<00:02:08.560> and<00:02:09.509> as<00:02:10.509> I<00:02:10.630> looked<00:02:10.810> around<00:02:10.899> his<00:02:11.140> head

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319

I<00:02:11.560> saw<00:02:11.709> these<00:02:11.860> little<00:02:12.160> white<00:02:12.340> dots

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.050 

when<00:02:25.440> I<00:02:25.470> got<00:02:25.620> a<00:02:25.650> magnifying<00:02:26.190> glass<00:02:26.280> out<00:02:26.700> I<00:02:26.880> saw

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
that these doubts were moving that there

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.450 
that these doubts were moving that there
were<00:02:29.580> parasites<00:02:30.150> invading<00:02:30.600> his<00:02:30.690> fur<00:02:30.990> and<00:02:31.860> in

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
just a couple of minutes as I was

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.810 
just a couple of minutes as I was
holding<00:02:34.260> him<00:02:34.440> in<00:02:34.530> my<00:02:34.560> hand<00:02:34.920> he<00:02:35.550> started

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
holding him in my hand he started

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.700 
holding him in my hand he started
thrashing<00:02:36.150> vigorously<00:02:36.930> at<00:02:37.050> his<00:02:37.140> ear<00:02:37.410> and<00:02:39.710> he

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
thrashing vigorously at his ear and he

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
was squeaking and he was thrashing and

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.810 
was squeaking and he was thrashing and
he<00:02:42.480> was<00:02:42.600> squeaking<00:02:43.130> until<00:02:44.130> finally<00:02:44.310> he<00:02:44.700> went

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820

was<00:02:50.040> devastated<00:02:50.220> I<00:02:50.850> was<00:02:51.540> especially<00:02:51.930> upset

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
was devastated I was especially upset

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.630 
was devastated I was especially upset
because<00:02:52.710> I<00:02:52.920> knew<00:02:53.040> that<00:02:53.220> this<00:02:53.310> could<00:02:53.520> have<00:02:53.610> been

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
because I knew that this could have been

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.220 
because I knew that this could have been
avoided<00:02:53.820> had<00:02:54.150> I<00:02:54.300> changed<00:02:54.660> his<00:02:54.780> cage<00:02:54.990> more

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
avoided had I changed his cage more

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:04.440 
avoided had I changed his cage more
often

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.899

mammary<00:03:57.420> tumors<00:03:57.840> they<00:03:59.390> got<00:04:00.390> them<00:04:00.600> about<00:04:00.840> the

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
mammary tumors they got them about the

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.350 
mammary tumors they got them about the
same<00:04:01.200> time<00:04:01.530> but<00:04:01.890> Mildred's<00:04:02.550> grew<00:04:02.730> much<00:04:02.910> larger

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
same time but Mildred's grew much larger

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.860 
same time but Mildred's grew much larger
and<00:04:03.480> much<00:04:03.569> quicker<00:04:03.870> than<00:04:04.170> Gertrude's<00:04:04.830> I

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
and much quicker than Gertrude's I

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.910 
and much quicker than Gertrude's I
started<00:04:06.870> feeling<00:04:06.990> very<00:04:07.319> bad<00:04:07.560> for<00:04:07.800> them

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
started feeling very bad for them

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.199 
started feeling very bad for them
because<00:04:07.950> these<00:04:08.340> tumors<00:04:08.730> were<00:04:08.850> getting<00:04:09.060> rather

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
because these tumors were getting rather

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.570 
because these tumors were getting rather
large<00:04:09.600> and<00:04:09.810> impeding<00:04:10.230> their<00:04:10.319> motion<00:04:10.800> it<00:04:11.459> was

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
large and impeding their motion it was

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:17.479 
large and impeding their motion it was
hard<00:04:11.790> for<00:04:11.819> them<00:04:12.030> to<00:04:12.060> walk<00:04:12.300> around<00:04:12.720> I<00:04:16.489> couldn't

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
hard for them to walk around I couldn't

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.960 
hard for them to walk around I couldn't
afford<00:04:17.579> to<00:04:17.880> euthanize<00:04:18.570> them<00:04:18.780> at<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.019> vet<00:04:19.230> and
