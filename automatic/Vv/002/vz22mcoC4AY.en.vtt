00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.700
 I had to go through a huge forest in 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.030
 the one that lived a ferocious wolf 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:49.230

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.350
 confident 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:24.130
 the wolf said goodbye and ran 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.159
 I wanted to get to Grandma's house before 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.219

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.009

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:35.270
 he entertained playing with a butterfly and 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.270
 picking flowers 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.300

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.690
 luckily the evil wolf stumbled upon 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.710
 a wooden stool and fell off 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:14.440

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.440

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.190
 hide in a very large closet that 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.190
 There was in the bedroom 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:28.010

 while jumping out of bed ready to 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.100

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.370

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.370
 run 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:54.209

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.599
 ready to shoot 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:12.700

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:15.790
 wolf on a buttock 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.630

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:26.780
