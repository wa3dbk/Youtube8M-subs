a really nice job putting chefs in the
industry<00:02:08.280> sort<00:02:09.180> of<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.330> difference<00:02:09.630> that<00:02:09.750> I

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
industry sort of the difference that I

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.390 
industry sort of the difference that I
see<00:02:10.080> here<00:02:10.350> is<00:02:10.470> that<00:02:10.500> we're<00:02:10.770> really<00:02:11.040> having

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
see here is that we're really having

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.420 
see here is that we're really having
students<00:02:12.060> get<00:02:12.300> in<00:02:12.480> there<00:02:12.750> and<00:02:13.020> be<00:02:13.860> hands-on

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
students get in there and be hands-on

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.200 
students get in there and be hands-on
like<00:02:15.240> with<00:02:15.480> my<00:02:15.630> purchasing<00:02:16.230> class<00:02:17.210> the

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
like with my purchasing class the

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.850 
like with my purchasing class the
students<00:02:18.630> are<00:02:18.720> actually<00:02:18.900> bringing<00:02:19.530> in<00:02:19.740> the

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
students are actually bringing in the

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.260 
students are actually bringing in the
purchases<00:02:20.370> they're<00:02:20.550> checking<00:02:20.910> them<00:02:21.090> in

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
purchases they're checking them in

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.420 
purchases they're checking them in
they're<00:02:21.810> learning<00:02:22.020> about<00:02:22.260> how<00:02:22.470> to<00:02:22.830> store<00:02:23.400> them

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
they're learning about how to store them

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.400 
they're learning about how to store them
hands-on<00:02:24.240> instead<00:02:24.780> of<00:02:24.870> just<00:02:25.020> talking<00:02:25.170> about

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
hands-on instead of just talking about

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.380 
hands-on instead of just talking about
it<00:02:25.590> in<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.710> classroom<00:02:25.920> I<00:02:26.160> think<00:02:26.310> that's<00:02:26.670> so

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
it in the classroom I think that's so

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.750 
it in the classroom I think that's so
important<00:02:28.020> that<00:02:28.740> they're<00:02:28.950> ready<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.460> they

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
important that they're ready and they

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.310 
important that they're ready and they
have<00:02:29.940> those<00:02:30.150> skills<00:02:30.510> when<00:02:30.690> they<00:02:30.780> go<00:02:30.930> out<00:02:31.080> in

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
have those skills when they go out in

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.130 
have those skills when they go out in
the<00:02:31.560> in<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.460> real<00:02:32.640> world<00:02:32.880> with<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.780> way<00:02:33.900> we're

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
the in the real world with the way we're

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.470 
the in the real world with the way we're
composting<00:02:34.860> we're<00:02:35.070> being<00:02:35.310> green<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:35.700> and

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
composting we're being green and and

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.880 
composting we're being green and and
eventually<00:02:37.140> we<00:02:37.320> want<00:02:37.440> to<00:02:37.560> have<00:02:37.650> our<00:02:37.770> own

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
eventually we want to have our own

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.600 
eventually we want to have our own
garden<00:02:38.130> out<00:02:38.580> on<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:38.910> top<00:02:39.120> roof<00:02:39.510> it<00:02:40.020> I<00:02:40.680> can<00:02:41.430> see
