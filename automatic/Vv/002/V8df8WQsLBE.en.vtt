and your phone is placed on a table you
can<00:03:56.329> obviously<00:03:56.989> shout<00:03:57.440> out<00:03:57.650> the<00:03:57.859> commands

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
can obviously shout out the commands

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.120 
can obviously shout out the commands
which<00:03:58.819> is<00:03:58.970> actually<00:03:59.329> pretty<00:03:59.510> cool<00:03:59.840> or<00:04:00.139> if<00:04:00.859> you

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
which is actually pretty cool or if you

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.009 
which is actually pretty cool or if you
can't<00:04:01.430> hold<00:04:01.579> the<00:04:01.670> phone<00:04:01.940> for<00:04:02.150> whatever<00:04:02.389> reason

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
you can still talk to the phone and you

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.910 
you can still talk to the phone and you
can<00:04:05.269> do<00:04:05.450> whatever<00:04:05.600> you<00:04:05.870> want<00:04:06.139> it<00:04:06.260> to<00:04:06.290> do<00:04:06.560> which

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
can do whatever you want it to do which

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.520 
can do whatever you want it to do which
is<00:04:07.069> actually<00:04:07.220> a<00:04:07.430> really<00:04:07.549> cool<00:04:07.790> feature<00:04:08.530> okay

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
is actually a really cool feature okay

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.150 
is actually a really cool feature okay
so<00:04:09.799> the<00:04:10.190> next<00:04:10.840> command<00:04:11.840> is<00:04:12.109> for<00:04:12.380> messages<00:04:12.950> now

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
so the next command is for messages now

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.140 
so the next command is for messages now
you<00:04:13.220> probably<00:04:13.579> get<00:04:13.910> the<00:04:14.030> gist<00:04:14.329> all<00:04:15.200> you<00:04:15.350> do<00:04:15.500> is

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
you probably get the gist all you do is

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.699 
you probably get the gist all you do is
so<00:04:17.150> for<00:04:17.450> instance<00:04:17.720> I<00:04:17.840> will<00:04:17.989> just<00:04:18.139> say<00:04:18.260> message

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
so for instance I will just say message

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.440 
so for instance I will just say message
four<00:04:19.039> times<00:04:19.340> and<00:04:19.700> then<00:04:19.789> when<00:04:19.940> I<00:04:19.970> go<00:04:20.180> to<00:04:20.239> the

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
four times and then when I go to the

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.029 
four times and then when I go to the
home<00:04:20.599> screen<00:04:20.840> I<00:04:21.080> would<00:04:21.140> just<00:04:21.349> say<00:04:21.470> message<00:04:21.859> and

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:22.039 
home screen I would just say message and

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:24.300 
home screen I would just say message and
it<00:04:22.099> would<00:04:22.190> go<00:04:22.400> straight<00:04:22.460> to<00:04:22.729> my<00:04:23.030> message<00:04:23.450> or

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
it would go straight to my message or

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.290 
it would go straight to my message or
the<00:04:25.310> next<00:04:25.520> one<00:04:25.700> would<00:04:25.789> be

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
the next one would be

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.409 
the next one would be
and<00:04:26.720> then<00:04:27.199> missed<00:04:27.500> calls<00:04:27.889> if<00:04:28.250> you<00:04:28.819> click<00:04:29.090> on<00:04:29.210> it

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
and then missed calls if you click on it

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:31.659 
and then missed calls if you click on it
you<00:04:29.629> can<00:04:29.840> change<00:04:30.169> the<00:04:30.560> function<00:04:30.770> which<00:04:31.400> goes

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
you can change the function which goes

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:33.700 
you can change the function which goes
to<00:04:32.000> either<00:04:32.240> you<00:04:32.690> can<00:04:32.840> unlock<00:04:33.229> it
