00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.020
 here I am going to open the tg of every two of 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.290
 sticks 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.570
 you see that my income my king 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:32.090
 of hands is very broad 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.960
 especially with these techos I am 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.440
 with 35 36 thousand chips more than 250 that is 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.890
 very 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.920
 lots of fish and this gives me to play 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:46.580
 teach you wide open in king two tg 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.010
 of clubs is a situation that you will not 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.269
 sure tech chats here then 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.610
 you see that I was already in the lap of 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:54.170
 opposition in a face with more or less 10 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.129
 thousand tokens communicated with more or less 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.170
 40 thousand and blaise that the reasonable stec it 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.269
 paying in position 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.560
 It's an uncomfortable situation for me. 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:08.659
 because surely I will not accept a 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.729
 Good flop, this mother is hardly you. 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:13.670
 a good flop is to throw a hand that will give me 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:16.820
 value for me to continue placing 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.049
 the inflation in that pot then this 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.790
 situation is already a situation 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:23.149
 uncomfortable a situation that people 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.850
 You have to be totally smart, but to 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.590
 people are doing in this hei-de cadoiço 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.259
 had tg is because we are 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.840
 prepared and can understand that the 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:35.289
 It's going to be good, we'll continue. 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.750
 in your hand and that the situation will not be 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:43.159
 then just like the awful flop button 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:45.829
 Of course it's 337 that I do this situation myself. 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.780
 I'm going to take it and take it back. 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:50.090
 reading is paying this 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.100
 situation with these technicians understood 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.859
 I have to define a rendition of it, I'm 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.750
 giving him here a reading in this 

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:59.539
 particular play for this guy 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.490
 understood I know I'm coming from 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:03.590
 every two of clubs 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.570
 tj because I'm playing enough hand 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.770
 ie I was playing pretty hand 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.539
 I'm passing on an image of not 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.610
 I'm always playing strong and 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:14.390
 consequently I will end up acting 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.190
 more call of marginal hands not hands 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.430
 also not very strong and not because 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:22.310
 just the villains my opponents 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.640
 You know I do not need a hand. 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.050
 too strong to be able to increase 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.570
 power 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:33.020
 the game then this is a very situation 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:39.610
 bad for me and I prefer Czech flop 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:41.960
 because for me ok I pull this pot is 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:46.610
 having a read of the car he has 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:49.100
 11 for on hand or has up to ice and some 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.050
 thing 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.000
 I do not think he has a very strong 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.120
 here but he has a hand of value 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.340
 Median that he does not pay taxes 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.550
 preflop because he just respected 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.040
 the strength in the hand in front of the position I 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:07.030
 I did not understand, so I understood that. 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:10.580
 that he did not want to not take a 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.590
 rocket on the flop because his hand did not 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.960
 was a hand of this value to pay this 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.560
 So I'm putting in a 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.150
 marginal here that I want to get him 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.240
 I can hardly take my hand. 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.990
 he flops on the flop he will abandon 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.600
 hand 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.430
 then in this situation surely already 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.620
 I'm thinking I'm going to have to give two 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.590
 Tiles is not to be a situation ever 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.690
 I'll have to put a lot of plug in because 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.360
 just a very dry fat and 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.760
 difficult to leave this average father who 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.320
 he chartered me even until one ended 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.989
 understood he pays the first payment to 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:48.800
 second knowing that they do not take the value and 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:50.480
 he knows that I'm putting the flop and tata 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.250
 understood is a situation that does not 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.050
 proving very valuable because I have 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.940
 to give insured on twitter because 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.640
 I have to respect my opponent. 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.010
 because it may have connected game then 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.980
 does not make sense this line of 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.200
 reasoning at the beginning of the hand I go 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.330
 leave the check because I said it is already 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.970
 an uncomfortable situation the guy already 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.690
 will put 820 in the position that I go 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.890
 I'll give you a check here. 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:19.220
 waiting for him to take a ford 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:21.590
 I'm going to pay just wait for his reaction alone 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.560
 what kind of my floating here I'm without 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.750
 position, I'm going to change which 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:30.470
 He understood and is he going to veto 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:32.210
 He'll pick you up but you understand how much 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.240
 I'll have to veto level to pull this 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.400
 pot than those situations where the 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.500
 people put themselves that are many questions 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.520
 we do we have little 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.280
 assurance 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.259
 So the best situation here now I 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.479
 I think it 's hand off 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:49.759
 I did not want to play with kaká the imposition 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:53.090
 even open in tj understood 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:55.940
 but is it enough you play up 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:58.069
 enough hands is important in the sense of 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.479
 that you confuse your opponent you 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:02.030
 and he ends up not having a read 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:04.940
 need what you really have in hand 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:07.789
 so in that situation I just you 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.949
 by playing very passively I felt badly 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:11.449
 uncomfortable situation simply 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:15.500
 I put it in my head I'm going to lose 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:16.990
 only two of something and serious 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.849
 game understood without much concern 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:22.159
 It turned out that there was a bad situation and I 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:25.190
 I quickly unplugged my hand 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:27.349
 by the reading I have of the play by the 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:30.169
 mend of the catar one paying there despite 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:35.240
 power can not be the river is so strong understood 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:37.759
 I did not even want to try to leave anymore 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:40.789
 his information still in hand 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:42.620
 because just the guy he is 71 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:44.659
 somewhat reduced and this is a situation 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.669
 what a draw is fact and what 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:49.639
 he is probably communicating 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:51.979
 with his hand in front of his stec and sometimes 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:54.259
 becomes more difficult to confuse and I 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:57.830
 Many of us go with a very light image. 

00:05:54.259 --> 00:06:00.529
 more playing 1 vacancy with very yields 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.870
 It's too late for him not to believe. 

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:04.550
 You have to understand this and I have to 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.139
 which know off in hand easily 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:10.669
 something that is extremely important 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:13.009
 we know that I see a lot of people is 

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:14.930
 having this thought is that 

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:17.719
 necessarily we have to win 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.460
 all the ports understood not have not 

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:21.740
 How do we win every day? 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:24.139
 This does not exist, do you understand? 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.240
 understand the situation favorable to 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:28.099
 an unfavorable situation a situation 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.139
 comfortable and a situation 

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:31.479
 uncomfortable for me in my 

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:34.279
 reading is a totally 

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:36.790
 comfortable in front of the positions and 

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:39.000
 villain stec 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.000
