00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
time to get the team set up and I wanted

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.520 
time to get the team set up and I wanted
to<00:00:37.890> make<00:00:38.070> this<00:00:38.190> video<00:00:38.370> quick<00:00:38.820> but<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:40.050> made<00:00:40.379> it

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
to make this video quick but I made it

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.170 
to make this video quick but I made it
on<00:00:40.649> superstar<00:00:41.250> which<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.670> hardest<00:00:41.940> mode

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
on superstar which is the hardest mode

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.810 
on superstar which is the hardest mode
and<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.540> made<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.899> game<00:00:43.079> play<00:00:43.410> hardcore<00:00:43.980> which

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
and I made the game play hardcore which

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.160 
and I made the game play hardcore which
I've<00:00:44.969> never<00:00:45.000> done<00:00:45.270> before<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.899> it's<00:00:46.050> actually

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
I've never done before and it's actually

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.560

way<00:00:46.559> better<00:00:46.590> there's<00:00:47.489> more<00:00:47.730> hits<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.450> it's

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
way better there's more hits and it's

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.569 
way better there's more hits and it's
harder<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.870> fight<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.289> computer<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.129> also<00:00:50.460> I

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
harder to fight the computer and also I

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.130 
harder to fight the computer and also I
actually<00:00:50.850> was<00:00:51.210> not<00:00:51.420> expecting<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:51.989> the

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
actually was not expecting that the

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.650 
actually was not expecting that the
computer<00:00:52.710> actually<00:00:52.860> BB<00:00:53.399> because<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:54.090> wasn't

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050
