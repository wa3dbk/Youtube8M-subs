00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
very easily you'll see how that works in

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.920 
very easily you'll see how that works in
a<00:02:10.020> moment<00:02:10.170> or<00:02:10.410> two<00:02:10.580> now<00:02:11.580> I<00:02:12.860> tend<00:02:13.860> to<00:02:13.950> play

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
a moment or two now I tend to play

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.350 
a moment or two now I tend to play
musical<00:02:15.930> pieces<00:02:16.140> different<00:02:16.830> ways<00:02:17.790> every<00:02:18.150> time

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
musical pieces different ways every time

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.990 
musical pieces different ways every time
I<00:02:18.390> play<00:02:18.660> them<00:02:18.870> so<00:02:19.550> never<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:20.640> same<00:02:20.790> way<00:02:20.940> twice

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
I play them so never the same way twice

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.210 
I play them so never the same way twice
but<00:02:21.510> I<00:02:21.720> always<00:02:22.110> throw<00:02:22.470> different<00:02:22.800> things<00:02:23.010> in

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
but I always throw different things in

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.770 
but I always throw different things in
and<00:02:23.430> one<00:02:23.910> thing<00:02:24.060> I've<00:02:24.150> realized<00:02:24.330> looking<00:02:24.690> at

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
and one thing I've realized looking at

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.699 
and one thing I've realized looking at
these<00:02:24.870> chords<00:02:25.320> is<00:02:25.410> that<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:26.100> very

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
these chords is that the very

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.710 
these chords is that the very
predominant<00:02:28.709> throw<00:02:29.100> a<00:02:29.160> lot<00:02:29.459> of<00:02:29.519> other<00:02:30.239> things

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
predominant throw a lot of other things

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.210 
predominant throw a lot of other things
I've<00:02:31.050> learned<00:02:31.320> so<00:02:31.500> many<00:02:31.560> years<00:02:31.890> if<00:02:31.980> you<00:02:32.070> think

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
I've learned so many years if you think

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.910 
I've learned so many years if you think
about<00:02:32.400> those<00:02:32.519> chords<00:02:33.000> a<00:02:33.150> flat<00:02:33.680> B<00:02:34.680> flat<00:02:35.480> C<00:02:36.480> my

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
about those chords a flat B flat C my

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.030 
about those chords a flat B flat C my
you<00:02:37.920> realize<00:02:38.340> that<00:02:38.549> they<00:02:38.700> are<00:02:38.880> very<00:02:39.390> common<00:02:39.810> to

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
you realize that they are very common to

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.949 
you realize that they are very common to
all<00:02:41.040> such<00:02:41.250> things<00:02:41.489> but<00:02:41.940> Patti<00:02:42.239> Smith<00:02:42.630> because

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
all such things but Patti Smith because

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:50.559 
all such things but Patti Smith because
tonight<00:02:43.290> like<00:02:43.890> this

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.539 

so<00:02:51.170> there<00:02:51.319> might<00:02:51.469> be<00:02:51.499> opportunity<00:02:52.069> to<00:02:52.189> throw

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
so there might be opportunity to throw

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.520 
so there might be opportunity to throw
that<00:02:52.700> into<00:02:52.879> the<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.629> piece<00:02:53.840> as<00:02:54.079> you're

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
that into the the piece as you're

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.449 
that into the the piece as you're
playing<00:02:54.769> that<00:02:55.040> the<00:02:55.219> the<00:02:55.519> placebo<00:02:55.939> chew<00:02:56.359> or

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
playing that the the placebo chew or

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.399 
playing that the the placebo chew or
even<00:02:58.569> don't<00:02:59.569> fear<00:02:59.810> the<00:02:59.900> reaper<00:03:00.049> if<00:03:00.319> you

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:00.409 
even don't fear the reaper if you

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:01.420 
even don't fear the reaper if you
remember<00:03:00.650> that<00:03:00.769> one

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430
