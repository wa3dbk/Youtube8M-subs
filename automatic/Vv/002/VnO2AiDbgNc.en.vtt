00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 hello yourself let's say you already 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.400
 decided you want to buy iphone 6 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.620
 and let's say we did it after my 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.809
 hour review remains unresolved 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.340
 question what color to prefer as in 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.710
 last year iphone and available in three 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.230
 color options are silver gold and 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.090
 cosmic gray but it seems to me in 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.980
 this time it will be much more determined 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.600
 harder our more so this time I 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.150
 I think that space gray wash ulte but it 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.130
 decision and why now tell you go 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.680
 Apple discounts to all subscribers from 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.480
 partner and store apple just.ru honestly 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.369
 I confess to you this video silver I 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.170
 atmel not immediately because I'm a ghoul 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.210
 some dumb seems to me the most 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.010
 uninteresting color available for 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.690
 iphone on the other hand in out every 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.149
 wait, what if I want to decide 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.100
 between black and white faceplate a 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.170
 gold is too gypsy for me 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.730
 option then i will say the following all 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.440
 pros and cons which I will call 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.539
 for the golden version in this video 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.010
 Absolutely suitable for silver so 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.930
 that in this sense we are these two colors 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.270
 combine specifically for this video i 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.070
 filmed iphone and in very bright light and not 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.079
 cleaned them before recording in order to 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.699
 you could watch all the villus mote 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.650
 and fingerprints and here we can 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.600
 note that any trash prints 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.520
 fingers on gold or silver version 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.830
 visible not so obvious but by virtue 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.900
 design solutions on light versions 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.210
 ring tachadi and shouts about his 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.650
 presence while on space gray 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.720
 it can be seen only under 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.130
 certain angle but this is of course a question 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.470
 purely aesthetic perception 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.479
 like the unfortunate stripes on the back cover 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.939
 it is a pity that in the space gray version they are not 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.590
 pretty dark well for my taste but here 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.390
 why not get away in the light version of this 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.430
 recoil to distance which is 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.710
 over the ear speaker he's here more 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.390
 what is visible while in the dark version 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.159
 here we have a full order 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.570
 although of course no crime in this 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.610
 No, and at one time I enjoyed and 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.590
 white and black and iPhones and 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.509
 it was always like that just to have this fact 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.189
 mind when choosing but that's what I separately 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.810
 would like to talk and for what i'm 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.329
 recording this video this 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.700
 screen rather its perception in whites and 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.560
 black versions generally have a feeling that 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.899
 the color of the rear cover, taking into account the availability of 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.180
 Covers for most do not really 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.520
 important while the faceplate is 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.320
 what are you looking at 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.939
 time on iphone 6 version black 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.860
 front panel you see no boundaries 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.840
 screen which creates very nice and 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.929
 whole feeling while on white 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.879
 these black ones 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.099
 and from them nowhere to go even more 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:17.650
 the picture on the screen is perceived as 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.870
 picture on the screen you see the display 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.909
 safety glass and this whole sandwich he 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.099
 always nothing new 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:25.750
 interesting on the black version you just 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.700
 this does not see the picture as if 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.650
 pasted on the screen design with just 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.299
 only enhances this effect and by the way 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.239
 pay attention to all promo 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.859
 materials iphone 6 is depicted in black when 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.450
 that don't want me wrong 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:39.159
 Understood I do not say that in the white version 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.989
 the screen is somehow not the same with him 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:43.510
 Excellent just in black due to the design 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.760
 This effect gives additional if 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.760
 not even the advantage is very pleasant 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.439
 feeling from the screen so if you people 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.269
 no matter what color iphone 6 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:54.310
 prefer i would recommend reversing 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:56.439
 attention to the black version because of this 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.359
 interesting fact you see a speck of dust in the corner 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:03:00.159
 iphone she beat there enough 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:01.689
 tight fuck you will get such will 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:03.700
 appear over time more and 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:05.950
 more and of course they are not visible on 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.689
 black version well, rather they are not so 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.849
 actively striking in contrast to 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:11.980
 prints and other villi in the end we 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:14.230
 we have a brand and a dark version on which 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.720
 Tachachidi is not visible and very cool effect 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.269
 on the screen and at the same time color version 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.549
 which is not so quickly poured on her 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.799
 seen tachadi and not so wonderful 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.629
 visible sensory screen 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:27.579
 bright faceplate i so for bloom 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:29.409
 added something no critical role 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:31.419
 plays at all I would choose a device 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:33.669
 based on light or dark facial 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:35.709
 panels and gold or silver is already 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:37.349
 will follow but as always I would like 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.000
 add so you are not hostage 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:42.220
 stereotype golden is it rich or 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.780
 girlish absolutely idiotic point 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.790
 view choose what you like 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.769
 only you this is your device you 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.689
 pay him money you walk with him 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.729
