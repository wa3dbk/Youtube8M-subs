least 10 plus hours another thing I
really<00:03:35.519> did<00:03:35.730> not<00:03:35.760> like<00:03:35.940> was<00:03:36.390> a<00:03:36.420> widescreen

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
really did not like was a widescreen

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.319 
really did not like was a widescreen
angle<00:03:37.680> I<00:03:37.890> understand<00:03:38.700> they're<00:03:38.879> going<00:03:39.180> for

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
angle I understand they're going for

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.750 
angle I understand they're going for
that<00:03:39.420> cinematic<00:03:40.019> look<00:03:40.290> but<00:03:40.980> for<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.250> cutscene

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
that cinematic look but for the cutscene

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.729 
that cinematic look but for the cutscene
that<00:03:42.000> translates<00:03:42.480> perfectly<00:03:42.720> but<00:03:43.500> for<00:03:43.650> the

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
that translates perfectly but for the

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.699 
that translates perfectly but for the
gameplay<00:03:44.280> it's<00:03:44.579> a<00:03:44.819> horrible<00:03:45.329> idea<00:03:45.680> because<00:03:46.680> of

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
gameplay it's a horrible idea because of

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.680 
gameplay it's a horrible idea because of
the<00:03:46.829> widescreen<00:03:47.280> angle<00:03:47.790> sometimes<00:03:48.390> it's<00:03:48.540> hard

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
the widescreen angle sometimes it's hard

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.240 
the widescreen angle sometimes it's hard
to<00:03:48.780> tell<00:03:48.959> when<00:03:49.139> a<00:03:49.170> cutscene<00:03:49.650> ends<00:03:50.069> and<00:03:50.190> the

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
to tell when a cutscene ends and the

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.309 
to tell when a cutscene ends and the
game<00:03:50.400> play<00:03:50.579> begins<00:03:50.910> the<00:03:51.420> whole<00:03:51.660> game<00:03:51.930> to<00:03:52.139> me

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
game play begins the whole game to me

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.349 
game play begins the whole game to me
just<00:03:52.590> felt<00:03:52.769> like<00:03:52.859> a<00:03:52.920> interactive<00:03:53.519> cutscene<00:03:54.090> it

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
just felt like a interactive cutscene it

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.090 
just felt like a interactive cutscene it
just<00:03:54.750> completely<00:03:55.350> took<00:03:55.590> me<00:03:55.739> out<00:03:55.920> of<00:03:55.950> the

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
just completely took me out of the

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.789 
just completely took me out of the
experience<00:03:56.750> another<00:03:57.750> major<00:03:58.109> thing<00:03:58.350> I<00:03:58.440> did<00:03:58.590> not

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
experience another major thing I did not
