00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.339
 bmw has more than 600,000 x3 in the 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.080
 sold last seven years and so 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.570
 the car is an absolute trendsetter 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.429
 and bestsellers at the beginning were still there 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.960
 pretty much alone on further corridor before 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.690
 The other manufacturers have noticed hey 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.279
 in the segment of compact suvs yes some 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.590
 this is the strongest 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.090
 growing segment of all sides there 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.600
 There is a lot of competition for example 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.490
 here the audi q5 modern and elegant and 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.039
 definitely in a league with the x3 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.750
 but bmw takes advantage of the grace of the early days 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.759
 born and now has first 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.250
 Manufacturer and the second generation at 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.750
 begin 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.670
 he is very fresh in the world and 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.120
 Nevertheless, he has grown significantly 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.160
 bmw x3 and indeed in all directions 8 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.980
 cm longer almost three centimeters wider 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.170
 and the wheelbase grows by 2 cm 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.760
 in other words he is pretty much accurate 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.460
 as big as the audi q5 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.440
 From the outside, the x3 has only very 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.330
 discreetly evolves better on everyone 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.710
 fall the tail that seems clearer now 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.200
 not as rugged as when 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.000
 predecessor in comparison to roundish 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.190
 renault audi does the bmw something 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.840
 more dynamic impression striking the 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.790
 striking lateral line which is scarce 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.670
 below the window almost over the 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.540
 entire vehicle length runs through 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.320
 clearly the differences in the 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.509
 inner space 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.850
 that was one of the points the x3 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.130
 were always accused of material 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.570
 Quality and selection would be a premium 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.880
 cars with the corresponding prices 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.070
 not really worthy of bmw here 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.680
 the criticism responds and the new x3 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.170
 significantly upgraded many elements 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.570
 the x5 and the new 5er bmw can be found 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.520
 the x3 looks nobler and more valuable again 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.940
 interior not least because of 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.800
 of competitive pressure by the audi q5 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.209
 its interior is audi typical 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.399
 beyond doubt 

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:47.360
 the material mix right is stylish 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.740
 And the quality is indeed premium 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.149
 surprisingly place champion audi has 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.459
 get serious competition 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.350
 in the back there is something in the bmw 

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:58.080
 airier than already in short supply 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.910
 cut audi around 550 liters 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.190
 luggage compartment volume means ten liters 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.050
 more than in the audi but there are still 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.649
 more criteria about the purchase 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.690
 decide 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.920
 the driving characteristics for example there 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.030
 we can not do it yet 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.130
 judge finally 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.720
 but one is already clear the bmw 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.060
 software has become softer 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.670
 more comfortable the merciless hardness of the 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.569
 predecessor is one clear 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.819
 given to everyday use vote 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.470
 and is thus on a par with the 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.340
 q5 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.770
 both are not much priced 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.350
 give less than 40,000 euros is hardly 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.840
 an x3 or q5 on the street 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:34.980
 advantage audi the q5 comes with one 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:38.310
 143 hp diesel engine from 36.800 euro 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:42.270
 bmw's entry-level model has 184 hp 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.280
 but also costs 39.100 euros for 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.530
 a comparable audi the two-liter 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.310
 diesel with 170 ps but then synonymous 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.680
 already 39 1400 euro due points 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.260
 the bmw consumes the smallest 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.290
 diesel are enough to eu-standard 5 6 liters 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.440
 on 100 kilometers audis 170 ps model 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.180
 needs 6 2 liters and therefore 0.6 liters 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.340
 more we summarize 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.540
 the new bmw x3 got out of the mistakes of the 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.970
 learned past 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.190
 he has grown more comfortable and 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.780
 consumes significantly less and is in the 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.810
 competitor circles now that 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.060
 most advanced car of the Audi Q5 is like 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.760
 up to date and has everything a thing 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.920
 premium compact and needs but the 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.200
 bmw x3 has just a shovel 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.320
 upped the ante, making it difficult to 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.320
 beat
