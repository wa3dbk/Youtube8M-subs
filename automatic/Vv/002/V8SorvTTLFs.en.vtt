strategies you are each faction has been

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.430 
strategies you are each faction has been
designed<00:02:05.760> in<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.450> different<00:02:06.810> way<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.260> know

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
designed in a different way you know

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.320 
designed in a different way you know
that<00:02:07.620> you<00:02:07.830> are<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:08.369> would<00:02:08.580> say<00:02:08.700> cover<00:02:09.060> the

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
that you are I would say cover the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.960 
that you are I would say cover the
spectrum<00:02:09.540> of<00:02:09.959> all<00:02:10.350> the<00:02:10.640> the<00:02:11.640> different

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
spectrum of all the the different

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.050 
spectrum of all the the different
strategist<00:02:12.840> that<00:02:13.080> exists<00:02:13.620> for<00:02:13.860> example<00:02:14.060> the

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
strategist that exists for example the

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.080 
strategist that exists for example the
US<00:02:15.360> Army<00:02:15.720> is<00:02:15.900> a<00:02:16.500> very<00:02:16.890> well-balanced<00:02:17.640> army

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
meaning that you get a lot of very good

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:30.540 
meaning that you get a lot of very good
units<00:02:21.600> and<00:02:21.810> cheap<00:02:22.410> units

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.330 

at<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.330> contrary<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:32.230> German<00:02:32.800> army<00:02:33.070> has<00:02:33.310> a

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
at the contrary the German army has a

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.700 
at the contrary the German army has a
different<00:02:33.730> approach<00:02:34.000> you<00:02:34.690> have<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:35.350> best<00:02:35.560> you

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
different approach you have the best you

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.440 
different approach you have the best you
need<00:02:35.890> the<00:02:36.010> most<00:02:36.190> powerful<00:02:36.760> but<00:02:37.090> there<00:02:37.300> will<00:02:37.420> be

need the most powerful but there will be
the<00:02:37.780> most<00:02:37.960> expensive<00:02:38.170> units<00:02:38.830> so<00:02:39.520> one<00:02:40.150> you<00:02:40.300> will

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
the most expensive units so one you will

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.690

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
superiority and all the aircraft so this

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.110

is<00:03:03.580> something<00:03:04.060> when<00:03:04.660> you<00:03:04.780> will<00:03:04.960> play<00:03:05.200> these

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
is something when you will play these

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.510 
is something when you will play these

strong assets and also some weaknesses

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.810 
strong assets and also some weaknesses
well<00:03:17.290> this<00:03:17.500> is<00:03:17.680> a<00:03:17.710> better<00:03:18.220> view<00:03:18.460> of<00:03:18.520> what<00:03:18.700> the
