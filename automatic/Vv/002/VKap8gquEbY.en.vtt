00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
cold out of the refrigerator and they

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.740 
cold out of the refrigerator and they
hit<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.250> hot<00:01:41.549> pan<00:01:41.909> they<00:01:42.420> are<00:01:42.509> going<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.689> bring

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.080 
hit a hot pan they are going to bring
the<00:01:43.290> temperature<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.829> our<00:01:43.950> pan<00:01:44.159> down<00:01:44.430> we're

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
the temperature of our pan down we're

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.340 
the temperature of our pan down we're
not<00:01:45.210> going<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.420> get<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.659> crust<00:01:46.049> in<00:01:46.320> the

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
not going to get the crust in the

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.889 
not going to get the crust in the
searing<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.070> we<00:01:47.189> want<00:01:47.490> on<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:47.970> also<00:01:48.479> we

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
searing that we want on it and also we

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.020 
searing that we want on it and also we
can<00:01:49.049> get<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.350> crust<00:01:49.740> eventually<00:01:50.490> but<00:01:50.909> it

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
can get that crust eventually but it

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.179 
can get that crust eventually but it
might<00:01:51.270> lead<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:52.110> very<00:01:52.320> middle<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.890> rare

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
might lead the very middle of it rare

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.069 
might lead the very middle of it rare
and<00:01:53.490> cold<00:01:53.880> so<00:01:54.360> we<00:01:54.450> definitely<00:01:54.600> don't<00:01:54.869> want

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
and cold so we definitely don't want

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.480 
and cold so we definitely don't want
that<00:01:55.140> when<00:01:55.740> he<00:01:55.829> gets<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.070> room<00:01:56.189> temperature

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
that when he gets to room temperature

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.219 
that when he gets to room temperature
it'll<00:01:56.969> hit<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.210> pan<00:01:57.420> it'll<00:01:57.899> immediately

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
it'll hit the pan it'll immediately

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.289 
it'll hit the pan it'll immediately
start<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:58.950> see<00:01:59.159> her<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.430> that's<00:01:59.909> how<00:02:00.119> we're

start to see her and that's how we're

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:00.990 
start to see her and that's how we're
going<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.450> get<00:02:00.630> a
