00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
with the top layer and this is what's

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.740 
with the top layer and this is what's
good<00:02:27.459> for<00:02:27.820> the<00:02:27.910> rat<00:02:28.030> tail<00:02:30.300> section<00:02:31.300> off<00:02:31.540> like

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
good for the rat tail section off like

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.190 
good for the rat tail section off like
that<00:02:32.250> we<00:02:33.250> need<00:02:33.400> backcomb<00:02:33.880> it<00:02:34.030> just<00:02:34.810> like<00:02:34.989> this

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
that we need backcomb it just like this

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.620 
that we need backcomb it just like this
and<00:02:35.709> do<00:02:35.860> it<00:02:35.890> quick<00:02:36.220> because<00:02:36.459> if<00:02:36.730> you<00:02:36.850> do<00:02:37.030> that

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
and do it quick because if you do that

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.290 
and do it quick because if you do that
you're<00:02:38.200> not<00:02:38.320> going<00:02:38.470> to<00:02:38.530> get<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:38.739> same<00:02:38.920> effect

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
you're not going to get the same effect

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.890 
you're not going to get the same effect
that's<00:02:40.300> just<00:02:40.570> claimed<00:02:42.540> it's<00:02:43.540> going<00:02:43.600> to<00:02:43.780> look

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
that's just claimed it's going to look

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.720 
that's just claimed it's going to look
really<00:02:43.930> ridiculous<00:02:44.709> at<00:02:45.610> first<00:02:45.640> obviously

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.240 

and<00:02:49.730> just<00:02:49.880> do<00:02:50.030> this<00:02:50.180> everywhere<00:02:51.010> some<00:02:52.010> people

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
and just do this everywhere some people

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.770 
and just do this everywhere some people
do<00:02:52.370> their<00:02:52.520> bangs<00:02:52.730> but<00:02:53.060> my<00:02:53.210> bangs<00:02:53.420> are<00:02:53.570> too

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.570 
do their bangs but my bangs are too
short<00:02:54.050> so<00:02:54.200> I<00:02:54.530> just<00:02:54.830> like<00:02:54.950> to<00:02:55.100> leave<00:02:55.280> them<00:02:55.430> in<00:02:55.550> my

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
short so I just like to leave them in my

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:01.000 
short so I just like to leave them in my
face

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.949 

but<00:03:01.580> I<00:03:01.670> don't<00:03:01.819> really<00:03:01.939> do<00:03:02.180> the<00:03:02.299> back<00:03:02.510> that<00:03:02.780> much

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
but I don't really do the back that much

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.920 
but I don't really do the back that much
either<00:03:03.200> I<00:03:03.700> should<00:03:04.700> because<00:03:05.239> it<00:03:05.510> would<00:03:05.810> look

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
either I should because it would look

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.350 
either I should because it would look
kind<00:03:06.170> of<00:03:06.230> stupid<00:03:06.590> from<00:03:06.829> back<00:03:07.340> it's<00:03:07.939> flat<00:03:08.329> and

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
the sides are crazy so I'll just do that

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:19.680
