00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.279
 you guys that's bad I hope you 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.730
 go good new video on fifa 15 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.650
 today 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.710
 why because there was the 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.850
 xbox conference and they balanced the 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.489
 15 new legends 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.949
 so she's showing right now at 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.750
 the screen is also having a little bit if we 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:42.780
 whether or not our predictions 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.290
 g I have my side well there the five 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.519
 episodes 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.650
 so that's good we did three deputies 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:47.460
 from close story episode to 15 legend we're going 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.150
 see on the 15 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.920
 how much did just right in life 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.040
 on the photo denis and who behind the 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.190
 hedge that 14 legend one the 15th in fact 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.820
 it's beckenbauer and is not but we have 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.090
 seen in the trailer 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.070
 so that's the first one we 've got 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.020
 effect when we left idan bale has 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.560
 everything wrong there none that's a pity what 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.320
 is not said dan 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.899
 after we do not know all but maybe 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.880
 picture rights story I'm not too 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:16.830
 what in any case first episode of 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.060
 legends predictions we have zero out of three 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.680
 which starts well second episode on 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.250
 had put or ronaldo 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.140
 to 9 platini and oliver kahn none of 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.560
 three no more pique stung by ronaldo 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.030
 honestly 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.220
 because 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.740
 there too we do not know all and our 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.290
 picture story ok but but still 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.440
 this is it's one of the best of 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:44.640
 football is good that it is built no 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:47.009
 more oliver kahn no more high it is 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.460
 receives 3 the third 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:53.430
 roberto carlos maradona eusebio 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.600
 we have a fair on roberto carlos 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.460
 so it's good 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.250
 it's okay it's going to be a big map 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.290
 I think but these two matches and no 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.399
 maradona no more and you and left 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.320
 think and honestly to and diot 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.970
 I was confident because with his 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.140
 death everything is a small tribute on 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.660
 May 2 in the legs but it's not 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.720
 so the case roberto carlos if there is 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:16.410
 it's good guys finally 1 of 9 we are 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.810
 good so here's the fourth episode on 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.150
 had said beckham cruijff and panes 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.040
 good for beckham was a little daring but 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.030
 cruijff and beats there would have been 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:29.610
 medium but again 0 out of 3 so 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.010
 it's a pity but also really 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.049
 pity they do not aggravate the 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.620
 youtube fans videos because it 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:40.019
 there were ideas coming out so that's it 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:43.070
 we are for the moment we did when 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:45.989
 even four episodes we are at 1 of 12 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.720
 and the last good last episode of my 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.799
 does people from late career or 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.760
 freshly retired so that's for sure 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.950
 that there was no legend 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.110
 this term also refers to golden and juninho 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.560
 so here there are none of the three in the 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.989
 legends 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.760
 but here are ideas and legends 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.859
 nice to the coach who will be 5 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.630
 stars because in the trailer we 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:05.519
 sees who makes a naive gesture that this 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.320
 focus which here is five floors and 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.459
 technical and then good it's a nice dish 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.299
 technical so there's a way 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:15.120
 after this ultra white bream Barresi 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:19.290
 gouÃ©no keane and brothers laudrup aps 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:22.110
 moore to coach roberto carlos this match 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.560
 michael his guardians of an alan right 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.870
 shearer stojkov and valderrama well that's 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.299
 now to see the cards 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.830
 see the stats but here's winning 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.440
 carlos flows to the coach pretty cool 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.590
 white is cool after that line 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.420
 shearer who did not stop beautiful cards from 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.280
 so here listen listen was waiting jeans 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:45.090
 do not forget so when lady 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.129
 beckenbauer weekend bauer that's it I 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.629
 want a girl it was good but what 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:50.099
 player 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:52.379
 so here are fifteen new legends the 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:54.569
 here and we did 1 of 15 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:56.579
 it's good guys we 're heavy go 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:00.530
 it was all a judge for that as long as a 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.530
 little video like that was going
