00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello everyone with you hookahs and in 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.440
 today's video is about 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.150
 sky screw modifications however before themes 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.150
 I wanted to consider the modification myself 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.590
 would tell a couple of common words in general 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.389
 Calvin's last review was made 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.310
 autumn of 2013 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.230
 This is due to the fact that then came out 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.330
 public version 0.9 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.770
 a long time has passed since 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.590
 developers changed their style 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.180
 development modification access to the worker 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.650
 build only those who accept 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.690
 direct participation in the work on 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.039
 modification itself strangers do not 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.750
 have the ability to download itself 

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:35.699
 modification for precisely this reason 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.920
 for a long time there were no reviews 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:39.839
 that I am lazy or not, there is simply no desire 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.640
 access to the current version of the worker 

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:43.409
 build but since lately 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.749
 I am very often asked what to 

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:47.940
 sky windom i decided to do this 

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:49.800
 video the entire media content is taken from 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.140
 official sources that is from the forum 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.329
 with the channel on y tube it is just cutting and 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.199
 installation sincerely hope that closer to 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.120
 Autumn I will have the opportunity 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.010
 independently try to create proteins 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.929
 some kind of opinion directly by 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.760
 the game itself is a modification but now 

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:04.559
 let's go directly to sky 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.780
 Windows and what was done for 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.910
 last year and a half did 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.630
 There was a lot lately and I even 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.570
 find it difficult 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.420
 what would start perhaps begin with the build 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.640
 there is no modification and this is due to 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.680
 that the developers have removed all the textures 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.770
 which are related to objects which 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.200
 have been ported from oblivion and besides 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.810
 this hour the texture is repainted 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.730
 Specially selected for work segments 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.280
 by region you need to do that already 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.320
 ready therefore there is simply no full 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.880
 worker games therefore nothing all these 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.620
 display lines only demonstrates 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.420
 separate frame and somewhere screenshot or 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.600
 best practices current version for 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.730
 developers goes under the number 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.320
 096 and this is the last working build and number 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.150
 version does not mean that the team 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.170
 close to the release of the modification and that in 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.340
 coming soon 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.440
 sky screw version 100 is only internal 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.620
 version designation when the project is only 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.440
 began in the plans was to move the third 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.210
 part on the engine of the fifth part and all however 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.460
 over time, the team revised their 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.140
 goals and tasks and now do not develop 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.239
 full modification in which not 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.280
 there would be no object no 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:14.050
 patterns and textures are from past 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.630
 parts so the staff and designers nim 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.340
 dealers rely on their internal 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.490
 concept art they create their models 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.990
 your texture is nothing here 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.030
 borrowed ie everything is done by forces 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.180
 and the team itself and here is such 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.820
 fine important facet sky screw is not 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.950
 morrowind i.e. this is not what it was 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.080
 The third part of Skyline is a modification of 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.000
 motives can already be seen 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.590
 some innovations added 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.750
 directly to developers from 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.240
 canyons and the appearance of some 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.640
 animals of some armor weapons 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.980
 the appearance of the cities themselves all this 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.560
 slightly different from what it was in 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.110
 the third part therefore know that sky 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.960
 the screw is a modification based on and not the one 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.270
 very level well or sky screw is a set 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.010
 patterns and textures to 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.840
 bring the game to the next more 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.970
 high-quality and improved engine 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.430
 if we talk about models and textures 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.710
 done a great job on the current 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.710
 moment made various armor such 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:15.820
 like glass bonita you and the armor of 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:18.010
 skin necha iron armor guild moraga 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.950
 tong and many many others appeared 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.380
 new building models for such cities 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.080
 like baldera caldera hang this 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.660
 fishing huts architecture however 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.300
 a new better made very 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.520
 great work account rests in many ways 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.770
 nero all lots and lots on different 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.959
 concerts to their too huge amount 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.630
 there are some talented people in the team 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:43.270
 guys who paint very unique 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.910
 very beautiful very unusual and based 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.050
 different models are created 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.480
 surrounding is always the same 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:52.470
 forgotten models are created for stones and 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.360
 trees of some kind of rocks for the ticket 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.820
 stone figures columns that is there 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.410
 tremendous diversity and landscape 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.090
 will now look at unique and 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.310
 unusual places dramatically 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.980
 different from what could have been 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.720
 go to the third part and of course having 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.640
 such a number of models and textures 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.470
 work directly in the editor is not 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.360
 standing still ie work is underway 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.700
 over the landscape above the cities above 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.919
 the interiors of some major cities 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.590
 were completed such as caldera bal 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:23.440
 the moro was partially completed in my 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.030
 the region of the bitter coast of themselves but when 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.160
 say that the percentage of what's 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.020
 here the team finished work i can't 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.760
 since someone can correspond 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.310
 come back and start redoing something 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.950
 correct because with people what is done 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.260
 it was poor however to say about 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.720
 mechanics and gameplay modifications I'm not 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.610
 can i have no clue on 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.450
 what stage of development are the data 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.240
 systems 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:48.880
 I know what is on very early 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.870
 stage concept new interface for 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.240
 modifications 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.850
 completed whether he or loved ones have completed 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.310
 I do not know about quests, then they 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.919
 most part will be completed 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.410
 crack for modification not known 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:05.020
 originally planned whether he will be in 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.479
 the result is not yet clear and obvious 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.760
 the most important is the release date she 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:12.039
 unknown since the amount of work 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.380
 still big when the team will 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:16.630
 ready to imagine anything though 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.300
 would be the original public version 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.020
 incomprehensible and I repeat that I am waiting 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.250
 the fall 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.680
 I hope then there will be an opportunity 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:26.110
 independently try modification and 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.580
 look inside what has been done there 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.530
 that case if you want promptly 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.820
 receive all the news on the sky Windows and 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.729
 follow directly the development 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.860
 modifications I recommend periodically 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:38.050
 enter or subscribe to public 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.300
 VKontakte is the official page 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.340
 communities and there you can very quickly 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.280
 get yourself all the information regarding 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.360
 rock on or else oblivion and also 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.760
 VKontakte group 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.430
 elder council and on the website tulp.ru 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.830
 news is periodically published 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.570
 official translations 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.940
 All useful links are in the description. 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.590
 Under the video clip I hope that this 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.510
 With a video I answered some of yours. 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.850
 questions about sky Windows and process 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:06.130
 development so don't worry could not 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:07.479
 abandoned it is being actively developed on 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.550
 I have this thank you very much for 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:13.080
 attention with you was hookah all the best 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.080
 and see you soon bye
