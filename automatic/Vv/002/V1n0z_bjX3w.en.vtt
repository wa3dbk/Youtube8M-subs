00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:31.890
 3rd series of channel every two weeks 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:33.739
 before the price of pigs crude Libyan 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.579
 on the championship 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.980
 thomas Ulysses is what today's 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.780
 win are well known yeah really 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.850
 today is his greatest race 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.530
 he showed he had the level 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.489
 so 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.829
 I think we are better 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.210
 before the race when you can come back 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.079
 on events had come to take 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.760
 the head in the first turn and 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.710
 then you managed and ran tenors 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.050
 well yes I had a good point that's 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.750
 leaving he was with the fake 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.760
 departures this departure I lost 15 meters 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.339
 he put himself in between the legs and he 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.449
 stalled for five 5 10 m 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:06.479
 and suddenly I part of the fifteen 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.070
 medals and after I had to make a big 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.620
 effort to come and 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.479
 nice is a funny tale according to him if 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.430
 you had the choice will mount caribe or 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.710
 ulysses who would take the game without 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:22.619
 to speak of the case without speaking of the heart by 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:25.290
 caribe much more hardened after the 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.460
 link we do not know its limits chose 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.369
 meet because we do not know his 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.490
 limits that happens again a super 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.640
 beautiful damian dress we decided to 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.020
 start with a lottery 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.430
 that's what he did last turning 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.750
 had a little trouble we know started well 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.920
 it's still a horse that gives 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.350
 always the best of him but well 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.060
 it's a love of short hair and I 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.619
 think sometimes and give themselves more 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:55.450
 of time to 110% but do not care in his 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:59.540
 super hot following her passport 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.340
 another race at most three 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.740
 weeks I think it's the moon in the 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.479
 days but if he wants to build him 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.340
 franck hutteau who he is at once 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.899
 reassuring and a little bit disappointing 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.209
 because at fifteen days the body of the 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.170
 lion expected less the only short 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:14.850
 Well, it's much better 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.950
 they 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.270
 the races before yes 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.819
 I think he is not far from his 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.340
 value has always been defeated by uys 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.280
 but still beaten by a note between them 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.840
 two here and it's not a first 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.910
 communal roads but good here the five 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.590
 sixth games very happy already on 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.730
 confirm you will be sure of riding 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.980
 the rate that is today the place at 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:52.349
 game I have no others so 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:54.750
 I'm tinto mens working at 3 but 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:57.299
 it is there that you can normally 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:01.470
 you can stick everything on everything and 3 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:02.730
 August with because you stay two 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.560
 high places so that they do this 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:13.860
 tournament uk the cold under finish 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:20.160
 we will be good for a good we will be 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:23.670
 well for the privileged open because 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.720
 it's even if I'm not down it's rare 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.720
 we were not bad 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:34.120
 but I want on the contrary mathieu 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.780
 what did you think of the delivery of 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.040
 wanderers of the mag 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.150
 good I am very happy a very short 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.810
 well at that level it was not easy 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.850
 to do a lot better 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.930
 he was a little cold he was missing 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.090
 a little job as he did at the 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.470
 beginning of is in Hen 1 but for the 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.030
 next move it 'll be okay 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.200
 worried going up bah yeah you're great 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.150
 cold even downhill he was struggling 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.410
 to put himself in the collar but he 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.130
 was a bit like that already so much foal 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.130
 and it was worth the next
