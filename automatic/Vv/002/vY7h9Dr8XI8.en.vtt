that's really I was surprised because we

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.340 
that's really I was surprised because we

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
experience and I think was gonna be a
little<00:01:02.789> bit<00:01:02.910> complicated<00:01:03.210> like<00:01:03.539> the

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
little bit complicated like the

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.760 
little bit complicated like the
certified<00:01:04.110> but<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.739> think<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:06.000> could<00:01:06.390> we<00:01:06.750> we<00:01:07.500> got

happen right now I think just leave the
cut<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:09.600> think<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.960> could<00:02:10.080> be<00:02:10.170> my<00:02:10.290> next

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
cut and I think it could be my next

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.950 
cut and I think it could be my next
fight<00:02:10.710> or<00:02:10.950> maybe<00:02:11.130> one<00:02:11.640> more<00:02:11.820> and<00:02:12.150> then<00:02:12.600> I<00:02:12.810> get

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960
