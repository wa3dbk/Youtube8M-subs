unusual<00:00:47.340> arrangement<00:00:48.340> here<00:00:48.790> that's<00:00:49.390> for<00:00:49.570> two

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720 
unusual arrangement here that's for two

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.570 
unusual arrangement here that's for two
reasons<00:00:49.750> one<00:00:50.230> is<00:00:50.770> it<00:00:50.890> allows<00:00:51.040> more<00:00:51.280> space

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:51.580 
reasons one is it allows more space

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.830 
reasons one is it allows more space
around<00:00:51.820> the<00:00:51.940> control<00:00:52.270> knobs<00:00:52.450> but<00:00:52.690> also

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
around the control knobs but also

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.420 
around the control knobs but also
because<00:00:53.260> we<00:00:53.350> can<00:00:53.470> run<00:00:53.620> the<00:00:53.740> EQ<00:00:54.010> in<00:00:54.100> a<00:00:54.160> different

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
because we can run the EQ in a different

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.730 
because we can run the EQ in a different
mode<00:00:54.660> this<00:00:55.660> is<00:00:55.690> currently<00:00:56.020> running<00:00:56.230> in<00:00:56.350> filter

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:56.740 
mode this is currently running in filter

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.800 
mode this is currently running in filter
mode<00:00:56.920> so<00:00:57.910> that<00:00:57.940> gives<00:00:58.210> me<00:00:58.330> a<00:00:58.360> low-pass<00:00:58.780> filter

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:58.810 
mode so that gives me a low-pass filter

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.560 
mode so that gives me a low-pass filter
with<00:00:59.260> a<00:00:59.320> sweep<00:00:59.670> and<00:01:00.670> a<00:01:00.760> high-pass<00:01:01.090> filter<00:01:01.450> with

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
with a sweep and a high-pass filter with

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.230 
with a sweep and a high-pass filter with
a<00:01:01.630> sweep<00:01:01.840> that<00:01:02.170> is<00:01:02.320> adjustable<00:01:02.710> breslin's
