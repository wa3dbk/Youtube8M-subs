00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
accurate track on this camera move I set

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.460 
accurate track on this camera move I set
up<00:02:37.400> this<00:02:37.970> board<00:02:38.300> on<00:02:38.420> top<00:02:38.450> of<00:02:38.690> a<00:02:38.780> tripod<00:02:39.200> so<00:02:39.380> that

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
up this board on top of a tripod so that

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.590 
up this board on top of a tripod so that
I<00:02:39.530> could<00:02:39.680> get<00:02:39.769> a<00:02:39.830> really<00:02:40.250> solid<00:02:40.700> track<00:02:41.209> using

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
I could get a really solid track using

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.479 
I could get a really solid track using
mocha<00:02:41.780> we<00:02:42.380> see<00:02:42.500> we<00:02:42.590> have<00:02:42.680> a<00:02:42.739> planar<00:02:42.980> surface<00:02:43.220> on

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
mocha we see we have a planar surface on

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.310 
mocha we see we have a planar surface on
top<00:02:43.519> which<00:02:44.269> is<00:02:44.299> basically<00:02:44.750> just<00:02:44.840> a<00:02:45.019> flat

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
top which is basically just a flat

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.740 
top which is basically just a flat
surface<00:02:45.709> that<00:02:46.160> we<00:02:46.250> can<00:02:46.459> track<00:02:47.030> using<00:02:47.570> mocha

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
surface that we can track using mocha

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.920 
surface that we can track using mocha
and<00:02:48.049> then<00:02:48.230> add<00:02:48.440> in<00:02:48.769> our<00:02:49.040> drummer<00:02:49.630> using<00:02:50.630> mocha

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
and then add in our drummer using mocha

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.410 
and then add in our drummer using mocha
and<00:02:51.230> After<00:02:51.620> Effects<00:02:52.120> again<00:02:53.120> here<00:02:53.269> we<00:02:53.390> have

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
and After Effects again here we have

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.270 
and After Effects again here we have
another<00:02:53.570> shot<00:02:53.870> that<00:02:53.900> just<00:02:54.260> involves<00:02:54.560> tracking

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
another shot that just involves tracking

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.009 
another shot that just involves tracking
and<00:02:55.430> then<00:02:55.489> adding<00:02:55.970> in<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.330> tuned<00:02:56.630> effects

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
and then adding in the tuned effects

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:58.630 
and then adding in the tuned effects
characters<00:02:57.500> which<00:02:57.680> are<00:02:57.799> already<00:02:58.190> pre<00:02:58.340> keyed

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
characters which are already pre keyed

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.400 
characters which are already pre keyed
so<00:02:58.820> I'm<00:02:59.360> really<00:02:59.540> just<00:02:59.660> dragging<00:03:00.140> them<00:03:00.290> in

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
so I'm really just dragging them in

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:01.600 
so I'm really just dragging them in
there<00:03:00.590> using<00:03:00.980> the<00:03:01.160> tuned<00:03:01.310> effects

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
there using the tuned effects

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.539 
there using the tuned effects
compositing<00:03:02.239> preset<00:03:02.720> to<00:03:03.230> match<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.310> lighting

for<00:03:42.349> these<00:03:42.440> drummer<00:03:42.739> shots<00:03:43.040> we<00:03:43.400> tracked<00:03:43.700> them

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
for these drummer shots we tracked them

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.509 
for these drummer shots we tracked them
in<00:03:43.970> using<00:03:44.300> mocha<00:03:44.540> but<00:03:45.200> we<00:03:45.319> also<00:03:45.470> did<00:03:45.680> was<00:03:45.890> i<00:03:46.160> sat

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
in using mocha but we also did was i sat

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:48.940 
in using mocha but we also did was i sat
behind<00:03:47.360> the<00:03:47.450> drum<00:03:47.660> and<00:03:47.900> kick<00:03:48.110> the<00:03:48.319> bass<00:03:48.500> drum

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
behind the drum and kick the bass drum

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.559 
behind the drum and kick the bass drum
so<00:03:49.190> that<00:03:49.400> it<00:03:49.580> looked<00:03:49.730> like<00:03:49.819> it<00:03:49.940> was<00:03:50.030> moving<00:03:50.269> and

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569 
so that it looked like it was moving and

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:52.809 
so that it looked like it was moving and
then<00:03:50.690> I<00:03:50.780> mask<00:03:51.019> myself<00:03:51.470> out<00:03:51.650> and<00:03:51.860> then<00:03:52.459> added

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
then I mask myself out and then added

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:54.250 
then I mask myself out and then added
that<00:03:52.910> in<00:03:53.090> to<00:03:53.239> add<00:03:53.390> to<00:03:53.540> the<00:03:53.629> realism<00:03:53.780> of<00:03:54.170> the

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
that in to add to the realism of the

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.280 
that in to add to the realism of the
shot<00:03:54.470> and<00:03:55.090> then<00:03:56.090> for<00:03:56.239> the<00:03:56.299> bass<00:03:56.480> part<00:03:57.080> I

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
shot and then for the bass part I

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.199 
shot and then for the bass part I
actually<00:03:57.709> stood<00:03:58.010> in<00:03:58.160> put<00:03:58.430> trackers<00:03:58.790> on<00:03:58.940> my<00:03:59.030> arm

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
actually stood in put trackers on my arm

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:00.880 
actually stood in put trackers on my arm
so<00:03:59.299> that<00:03:59.569> I<00:03:59.599> could<00:03:59.780> match<00:03:59.989> that<00:04:00.319> movement<00:04:00.739> to

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
so that I could match that movement to

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.940 
so that I could match that movement to
the<00:04:01.160> bassist<00:04:02.379> this<00:04:03.379> was<00:04:03.500> probably<00:04:03.769> of<00:04:03.890> the

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
the bassist this was probably of the

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.430 
the bassist this was probably of the
most<00:04:04.129> complicated<00:04:04.489> shots<00:04:04.970> and<00:04:05.299> it<00:04:05.569> we<00:04:05.690> used<00:04:05.930> 3d

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
most complicated shots and it we used 3d

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.280 
most complicated shots and it we used 3d

motion tracking npf track to gather 3d
camera<00:04:09.650> data<00:04:09.830> we<00:04:10.160> then<00:04:10.370> brought<00:04:10.700> that<00:04:10.910> into

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
camera data we then brought that into

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.550 
camera data we then brought that into
cinema<00:04:12.290> 4d<00:04:12.500> and<00:04:12.860> modeled<00:04:13.519> and<00:04:13.730> build<00:04:14.360> these<00:04:14.599> 3d

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
cinema 4d and modeled and build these 3d

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.979 
cinema 4d and modeled and build these 3d
characters<00:04:16.489> we<00:04:17.120> also<00:04:17.269> teach<00:04:17.540> you<00:04:17.690> how<00:04:17.780> to<00:04:17.840> do

that in the tune effects package but we

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.719 
that in the tune effects package but we
build<00:04:21.470> those<00:04:21.680> and<00:04:22.100> then<00:04:22.220> we<00:04:22.310> brought<00:04:22.520> them<00:04:22.669> in
