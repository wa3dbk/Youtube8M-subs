00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.630 
to keep pausing and unpause in your game
until<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.570> items<00:00:37.140> slightly<00:00:37.950> go<00:00:38.129> into<00:00:38.520> your

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
until the items slightly go into your

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.090 
until the items slightly go into your
inventory<00:00:38.820> as<00:00:39.600> well<00:00:39.899> as<00:00:40.050> being<00:00:40.469> on<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.829> ground

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
inventory as well as being on the ground

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.060 
inventory as well as being on the ground
at<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.730> same<00:00:42.000> time<00:00:42.480> so<00:00:43.110> just<00:00:43.320> keep<00:00:43.559> pausing

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
at the same time so just keep pausing

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.880 
at the same time so just keep pausing
and<00:00:44.219> unpause<00:00:44.940> in<00:00:45.120> your<00:00:45.270> game<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:46.559> didn't

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
and unpause in your game and I didn't

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.619 
and unpause in your game and I didn't
get<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.160> timing<00:00:47.430> too<00:00:47.670> great<00:00:48.000> just<00:00:48.239> then<00:00:48.420> so

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
get the timing too great just then so

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.660 
get the timing too great just then so
I'm<00:00:48.750> gonna<00:00:48.930> throw<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.770> items<00:00:50.129> back<00:00:50.370> on<00:00:50.430> the

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
I'm gonna throw the items back on the

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.610 
I'm gonna throw the items back on the
ground<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.149> redo<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.780> because<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.410> wouldn't

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
ground and redo it because it wouldn't

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.990 
ground and redo it because it wouldn't
have<00:00:52.770> worked<00:00:52.980> them<00:00:53.250> because<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.670> didn't<00:00:53.879> get

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
have worked them because I didn't get

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.819 
have worked them because I didn't get
the<00:00:54.090> timing<00:00:54.329> correct<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:55.230> just<00:00:55.440> keep<00:00:55.590> pausing

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
the timing correct so just keep pausing

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.700 
the timing correct so just keep pausing
and<00:00:56.250> unpause<00:00:56.699> in<00:00:56.910> your<00:00:57.059> game<00:00:57.270> until<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.260> items

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
and unpause in your game until the items

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.560 
and unpause in your game until the items
go<00:00:58.980> into<00:00:59.370> your<00:00:59.489> inventory<00:00:59.789> so<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.300> just<00:01:00.449> have

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
go into your inventory so you just have

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.810 
go into your inventory so you just have
to<00:01:00.629> do<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.840> really<00:01:01.230> really<00:01:01.350> quickly<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.280> just

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
to do it really really quickly and just
