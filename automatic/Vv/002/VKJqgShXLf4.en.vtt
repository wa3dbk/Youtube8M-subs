a little bit dark for me I don't know
why<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:46.770> keep<00:01:46.920> doing<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.549> myself<00:01:47.670> this<00:01:48.090> one

whatever reason comparing them next to
each<00:01:52.140> other<00:01:52.290> is<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.560> little<00:01:52.890> bit<00:01:52.979> difficult<00:01:53.189> to

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
each other is a little bit difficult to

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.550 
each other is a little bit difficult to
pick<00:01:53.729> out<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.880> shade<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.420> lot<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:55.020> times<00:01:55.259> I<00:01:55.409> can

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
pick out a shade a lot of times I can

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.499 
pick out a shade a lot of times I can
see<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:56.070> undertones<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.939> see<00:01:57.180> which<00:01:57.329> ones

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
see the undertones and see which ones

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.300 
see the undertones and see which ones
lighter<00:01:57.719> or<00:01:57.990> darker<00:01:58.020> but<00:01:58.829> this<00:01:58.979> one<00:01:59.130> was<00:01:59.280> a

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
lighter or darker but this one was a

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.069 
lighter or darker but this one was a
little<00:01:59.399> bit<00:01:59.790> tricky<00:02:00.180> i<00:02:00.210> could<00:02:00.420> probably<00:02:00.659> go

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
little bit tricky i could probably go

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.139 
little bit tricky i could probably go
one<00:02:01.680> shade<00:02:01.710> lighter<00:02:02.040> than<00:02:02.399> this<00:02:02.729> i've<00:02:03.030> only

this one more of a shot first and then
from<00:02:26.190> Milani<00:02:26.580> I<00:02:26.970> saw<00:02:27.240> these<00:02:27.420> lipsticks<00:02:28.140> I

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
from Milani I saw these lipsticks I

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.160 
from Milani I saw these lipsticks I
think<00:02:28.800> they're<00:02:28.980> fairly<00:02:29.250> new<00:02:29.580> I<00:02:29.910> had<00:02:30.420> one<00:02:30.720> that

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
think they're fairly new I had one that

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.450 
think they're fairly new I had one that
I<00:02:31.230> really<00:02:31.320> like<00:02:31.830> which<00:02:32.670> is<00:02:32.910> nude<00:02:33.240> clean<00:02:33.660> and

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
I really like which is nude clean and

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.610 
I really like which is nude clean and
this<00:02:35.460> one<00:02:35.700> is<00:02:36.000> actually<00:02:36.180> very<00:02:36.480> pigmented<00:02:37.110> but

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
this one is actually very pigmented but

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.590 
this one is actually very pigmented but
still<00:02:38.370> gives<00:02:38.640> it<00:02:38.790> really<00:02:39.030> nude<00:02:39.240> effect

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
still gives it really nude effect

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.450 
still gives it really nude effect
especially<00:02:39.930> for<00:02:40.410> me<00:02:40.500> who<00:02:40.680> doesn't<00:02:41.010> do<00:02:41.100> really

the<00:05:04.270> baby<00:05:04.480> lips<00:05:04.780> I<00:05:05.050> just<00:05:05.650> think<00:05:05.860> the<00:05:06.130> formula

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
the baby lips I just think the formula

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.790 
the baby lips I just think the formula
is<00:05:06.550> so<00:05:06.850> nice<00:05:07.060> and<00:05:07.300> easy<00:05:07.480> to<00:05:07.660> throw<00:05:07.810> on<00:05:07.930> I<00:05:08.350> like

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
is so nice and easy to throw on I like

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.530 
is so nice and easy to throw on I like
that<00:05:08.950> they<00:05:09.070> have<00:05:09.190> a<00:05:09.220> tenth<00:05:09.490> of<00:05:09.670> color<00:05:09.940> I<00:05:10.210> saw<00:05:10.510> a

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
that they have a tenth of color I saw a

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:11.790 
that they have a tenth of color I saw a
couple<00:05:10.960> that<00:05:11.230> would<00:05:11.320> come<00:05:11.500> with<00:05:11.530> a<00:05:11.650> limited

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
couple that would come with a limited

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.040 
couple that would come with a limited
edition<00:05:12.160> shade<00:05:12.670> and<00:05:12.940> then<00:05:13.030> an<00:05:13.360> older<00:05:13.720> shade

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
edition shade and then an older shade

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.720 
edition shade and then an older shade
and<00:05:14.350> I<00:05:14.560> wanted<00:05:14.860> to<00:05:14.920> find<00:05:15.070> the<00:05:15.250> ones<00:05:15.430> that<00:05:15.640> were

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:15.730 
and I wanted to find the ones that were

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:17.670 
and I wanted to find the ones that were
just<00:05:15.880> separate<00:05:16.450> the<00:05:16.630> limited<00:05:17.020> edition<00:05:17.140> so<00:05:17.650> I

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
just separate the limited edition so I

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.590 
just separate the limited edition so I
didn't<00:05:18.040> end<00:05:18.190> up<00:05:18.370> with<00:05:18.550> too<00:05:18.700> many<00:05:18.820> products<00:05:19.330> but

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 
didn't end up with too many products but

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.140 
didn't end up with too many products but
I<00:05:19.870> found<00:05:20.560> these<00:05:20.770> two<00:05:21.100> this<00:05:21.280> is<00:05:21.340> yummy<00:05:21.760> plummy

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
crush has barely anything actually so

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.010 
crush has barely anything actually so
this<00:05:30.400> if<00:05:30.610> you're<00:05:30.760> afraid<00:05:31.000> of<00:05:31.120> color<00:05:31.390> a<00:05:31.570> hundred

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
this if you're afraid of color a hundred

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.870 
this if you're afraid of color a hundred
percent<00:05:32.170> this<00:05:32.650> is<00:05:32.770> probably<00:05:33.160> more<00:05:33.430> for<00:05:33.670> you

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
percent this is probably more for you

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.970 
percent this is probably more for you
but<00:05:34.120> again<00:05:34.420> I<00:05:34.450> love<00:05:34.840> the<00:05:35.020> texture<00:05:35.500> so<00:05:35.740> I<00:05:35.770> don't

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:35.980 
but again I love the texture so I don't

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.200 
but again I love the texture so I don't
mind<00:05:36.160> having<00:05:36.340> something<00:05:36.670> that<00:05:36.880> doesn't<00:05:37.120> have

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
mind having something that doesn't have
