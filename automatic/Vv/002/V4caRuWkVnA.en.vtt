first<00:00:14.040> album<00:00:16.250> front<00:00:17.250> side<00:00:17.520> it's<00:00:17.789> pretty<00:00:18.000> nice

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
first album front side it's pretty nice

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.560 
first album front side it's pretty nice
the<00:00:19.650> box<00:00:19.949> is<00:00:20.160> pretty<00:00:20.189> nice<00:00:20.520> design<00:00:20.939> so<00:00:21.330> let's

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
the box is pretty nice design so let's

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:31.790 
the box is pretty nice design so let's
open<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:21.990> up<00:00:22.080> real<00:00:22.350> quick<00:00:30.289> hope<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.439> comes<00:00:31.560> with
