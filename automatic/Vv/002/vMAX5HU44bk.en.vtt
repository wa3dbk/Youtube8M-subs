with the intent to convince them to

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.230 
with the intent to convince them to
build<00:00:23.050> a<00:00:23.140> 15<00:00:23.470> by<00:00:23.590> 56<00:00:24.160> at<00:00:24.669> the<00:00:24.790> time<00:00:25.000> they<00:00:25.180> were

making an eight fifty six and really we

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.650 
making an eight fifty six and really we
felt<00:00:27.099> if<00:00:27.279> they<00:00:27.400> built<00:00:27.669> a<00:00:27.820> 15<00:00:28.210> on<00:00:28.360> that<00:00:28.480> same

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.660 
felt if they built a 15 on that same

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.909 
felt if they built a 15 on that same
frame<00:00:28.960> that<00:00:29.110> we<00:00:29.230> could<00:00:29.380> sell<00:00:29.560> a<00:00:29.590> bunch<00:00:29.739> of

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
these binoculars the sales pitch worked

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.960 
these binoculars the sales pitch worked
they<00:00:32.290> built<00:00:32.529> them<00:00:32.649> for<00:00:32.860> us<00:00:32.980> and<00:00:33.130> over<00:00:33.880> the

they built them for us and over the

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.040

years<00:00:34.149> we've<00:00:34.329> sold<00:00:34.540> a<00:00:34.660> bunch<00:00:34.750> of<00:00:34.930> these

years we've sold a bunch of these

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.900 
years we've sold a bunch of these
binoculars<00:00:35.350> now<00:00:36.220> this<00:00:36.430> is<00:00:36.579> the<00:00:36.730> third

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
binoculars now this is the third

rendition<00:00:37.420> the<00:00:37.480> latest<00:00:37.809> version<00:00:38.170> of<00:00:38.260> this

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
rendition the latest version of this

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.979 
rendition the latest version of this
1556<00:00:39.399> and<00:00:40.120> in<00:00:40.210> my<00:00:40.300> opinion<00:00:40.420> one<00:00:40.840> of<00:00:40.870> the

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
1556 and in my opinion one of the

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:42.900 
1556 and in my opinion one of the
greatest<00:00:41.260> improvements<00:00:41.950> was<00:00:42.610> the

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
greatest improvements was the

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.759 
greatest improvements was the
incorporation<00:00:43.420> of<00:00:43.629> an<00:00:43.750> avid<00:00:44.109> Koenig<00:00:44.410> prism

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:44.769 
incorporation of an avid Koenig prism

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:47.729 
incorporation of an avid Koenig prism
with<00:00:45.399> this<00:00:45.550> prism<00:00:45.940> system<00:00:46.089> does<00:00:46.510> it<00:00:47.469> allows

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
with this prism system does it allows

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:50.069 
with this prism system does it allows
two<00:00:48.309> fewer<00:00:48.760> air<00:00:49.059> to<00:00:49.239> land<00:00:49.420> surfaces<00:00:49.899> which

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
two fewer air to land surfaces which

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.799 
two fewer air to land surfaces which
improves<00:00:50.739> the<00:00:50.920> light<00:00:51.100> transmission<00:00:51.609> so<00:00:52.359> this

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
improves the light transmission so this

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:54.479 
improves the light transmission so this
binocular<00:00:53.140> the<00:00:53.589> new<00:00:53.710> version<00:00:54.039> actually<00:00:54.160> has

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
binocular the new version actually has

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:56.250 
binocular the new version actually has
six<00:00:54.789> percent<00:00:55.210> greater<00:00:55.449> light<00:00:55.719> transmission

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
six percent greater light transmission

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.220 
six percent greater light transmission
than<00:00:56.859> the<00:00:57.100> previous<00:00:57.550> model<00:00:57.909> did<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:59.079> other

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
than the previous model did the other

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.410 
than the previous model did the other
thing<00:00:59.469> it<00:00:59.559> does<00:00:59.589> allow<00:01:00.219> is<00:01:00.519> shorten<00:01:01.359> the

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
thing it does allow is shorten the

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.840 
thing it does allow is shorten the
system<00:01:01.749> up<00:01:01.929> so<00:01:02.589> it's<00:01:02.980> obviously<00:01:03.399> a<00:01:03.460> much<00:01:03.609> more

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
system up so it's obviously a much more

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.800 
system up so it's obviously a much more
compact<00:01:04.360> shorter<00:01:05.350> design<00:01:05.710> and<00:01:06.010> 7%<00:01:06.670> lighter<00:01:07.120> so

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
compact shorter design and 7% lighter so

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.170 
compact shorter design and 7% lighter so
it's<00:01:07.990> brighter<00:01:08.260> and<00:01:08.500> lighter<00:01:08.770> a<00:01:09.580> couple<00:01:10.060> of

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
it's brighter and lighter a couple of

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.260 
it's brighter and lighter a couple of
other<00:01:10.380> improvements<00:01:11.380> was<00:01:11.560> the<00:01:12.000> diameter<00:01:13.000> they

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
other improvements was the diameter they

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.420 
other improvements was the diameter they
put<00:01:13.450> a<00:01:13.479> larger<00:01:13.870> diameter<00:01:14.050> ocular<00:01:14.920> lens<00:01:15.159> in

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
put a larger diameter ocular lens in

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.150 
put a larger diameter ocular lens in
this<00:01:16.030> larger<00:01:16.600> diameter<00:01:17.110> just<00:01:17.290> allows<00:01:17.920> you

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
this larger diameter just allows you

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.260 
this larger diameter just allows you
especially<00:01:18.490> when<00:01:18.760> you're<00:01:18.850> on<00:01:18.880> the<00:01:19.030> tripod

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
especially when you're on the tripod

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.810 
especially when you're on the tripod
which<00:01:19.660> is<00:01:19.780> mandatory<00:01:20.140> with<00:01:20.500> a<00:01:20.560> pair<00:01:20.710> of<00:01:20.740> 15s<00:01:21.280> it

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
which is mandatory with a pair of 15s it

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.700 
which is mandatory with a pair of 15s it
just<00:01:22.000> allows<00:01:22.240> your<00:01:22.420> eye<00:01:22.480> a<00:01:22.930> little<00:01:23.560> more

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
just allows your eye a little more

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.560 
just allows your eye a little more
freedom<00:01:23.950> of<00:01:24.190> movement<00:01:24.370> you<00:01:25.030> don't<00:01:25.210> have<00:01:25.360> to<00:01:25.450> be

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
freedom of movement you don't have to be

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.420 
freedom of movement you don't have to be
stuck<00:01:25.900> right<00:01:26.050> in<00:01:26.170> the<00:01:26.320> same<00:01:26.500> spot<00:01:26.830> so<00:01:27.070> it's

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
stuck right in the same spot so it's

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.670 
stuck right in the same spot so it's
more<00:01:27.610> comfortable<00:01:27.880> glass<00:01:28.390> to<00:01:28.660> use<00:01:29.170> now<00:01:29.410> than

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
more comfortable glass to use now than

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.980 
more comfortable glass to use now than
the<00:01:29.770> previous<00:01:30.130> model<00:01:30.490> the<00:01:31.420> other<00:01:31.540> improvement

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
the previous model the other improvement

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.040 
the previous model the other improvement
is<00:01:32.080> this<00:01:32.230> four<00:01:32.440> position<00:01:32.920> I<00:01:33.100> cup<00:01:33.340> this<00:01:34.330> four

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
is this four position I cup this four

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.140 
is this four position I cup this four
position<00:01:35.440> I<00:01:35.530> cup<00:01:35.740> just<00:01:35.950> allows<00:01:36.250> you<00:01:36.520> to

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
position I cup just allows you to

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.810 
position I cup just allows you to
fine-tune<00:01:37.770> exactly<00:01:38.770> how<00:01:38.890> far<00:01:39.160> away<00:01:39.370> you<00:01:39.430> want

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
fine-tune exactly how far away you want

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.060 
fine-tune exactly how far away you want
your<00:01:40.000> eye<00:01:40.030> from<00:01:40.450> the<00:01:40.570> binocular<00:01:41.080> it<00:01:41.590> also<00:01:41.740> has

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
your eye from the binocular it also has

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.610 
your eye from the binocular it also has
more<00:01:42.850> eye<00:01:43.090> relief<00:01:43.630> than<00:01:43.840> the<00:01:43.930> previous<00:01:44.260> model

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 
more eye relief than the previous model

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.380 
more eye relief than the previous model
so<00:01:45.070> any<00:01:45.250> of<00:01:45.340> you<00:01:45.460> eyeglass<00:01:45.850> wearers<00:01:46.270> that

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
so any of you eyeglass wearers that

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:47.370 
so any of you eyeglass wearers that
we're<00:01:46.480> having<00:01:46.570> trouble<00:01:46.990> getting<00:01:47.080> a<00:01:47.230> full

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
we're having trouble getting a full

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.260 
we're having trouble getting a full
field<00:01:47.590> of<00:01:47.680> view<00:01:47.830> they<00:01:48.160> most<00:01:48.670> likely<00:01:48.910> solved

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
field of view they most likely solved

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.450 
field of view they most likely solved
that<00:01:49.390> problem<00:01:49.540> for<00:01:49.870> you<00:01:50.010> another<00:01:51.010> improvement

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
that problem for you another improvement

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.790 
that problem for you another improvement
was<00:01:51.850> they<00:01:52.570> actually<00:01:52.900> were<00:01:52.990> able<00:01:53.200> to<00:01:53.230> decrease

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
was they actually were able to decrease

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.470 
was they actually were able to decrease
the<00:01:53.980> interpupillary<00:01:54.430> distance<00:01:54.460> so<00:01:55.360> the

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.480 
the interpupillary distance so the

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.820 
the interpupillary distance so the
barrels<00:01:55.870> actually<00:01:56.230> get<00:01:56.350> closer<00:01:56.590> together

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
barrels actually get closer together

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.030 
barrels actually get closer together
there<00:01:57.580> were<00:01:57.700> quite<00:01:57.970> a<00:01:58.030> few<00:01:58.120> people<00:01:58.590> about<00:01:59.590> 15%

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
there were quite a few people about 15%

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.380 
there were quite a few people about 15%
of<00:02:00.340> the<00:02:00.430> people<00:02:00.520> the<00:02:00.790> previous<00:02:01.120> model

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
of the people the previous model

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.330 
of the people the previous model
couldn't<00:02:01.690> get<00:02:01.780> them<00:02:01.870> close<00:02:02.050> enough<00:02:02.350> now<00:02:02.560> it'd

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
couldn't get them close enough now it'd

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.920 
couldn't get them close enough now it'd
be<00:02:03.490> my<00:02:03.670> guess<00:02:03.940> that<00:02:03.970> they've<00:02:04.360> reduced<00:02:04.720> that<00:02:04.870> to

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
be my guess that they've reduced that to

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.260 
be my guess that they've reduced that to
probably<00:02:05.350> to<00:02:05.440> only<00:02:05.560> 2%<00:02:05.800> of<00:02:06.220> you<00:02:06.340> so<00:02:07.030> if<00:02:07.150> you

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
probably to only 2% of you so if you

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.550 
probably to only 2% of you so if you
couldn't<00:02:07.540> get<00:02:07.630> them<00:02:07.720> close<00:02:07.870> enough<00:02:08.140> I<00:02:08.319> bet

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
couldn't get them close enough I bet

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.660 
couldn't get them close enough I bet
you'll<00:02:08.769> be<00:02:08.890> able<00:02:08.950> to<00:02:09.160> with<00:02:09.310> this<00:02:09.429> binocular

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
you'll be able to with this binocular

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.540 
you'll be able to with this binocular
next<00:02:10.629> they<00:02:10.720> improved<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.280> field<00:02:12.280> of<00:02:12.400> view

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
next they improved the field of view

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.570 
next they improved the field of view
it's<00:02:13.360> up<00:02:13.480> to<00:02:13.599> 234<00:02:14.440> feet<00:02:14.680> at<00:02:14.890> a<00:02:15.010> thousand<00:02:15.430> feet

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
it's up to 234 feet at a thousand feet

it's up to 234 feet at a thousand feet
now

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
now

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
the new model Swarovski 1556 if you've

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.050 
the new model Swarovski 1556 if you've

it's<00:02:31.299> probably<00:02:31.689> time<00:02:31.810> to<00:02:31.870> upgrade<00:02:32.079> take<00:02:32.650> a

it's probably time to upgrade take a
