00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.969
 hello how am I come back if in this 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.730
 Minecraft tutorial I will teach you to 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.660
 make this mini game worth is very 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.110
 simple is to go through a 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.470
 side by side without the wagons 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.470
 your 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.809
 it's very easy I'm going to make you a little 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:36.840
 what would this be so as not to have 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:39.830
 do it very mainly 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:44.040
 as I had here done before it is done 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:46.829
 a square a rectangle the form that 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.159
 you want to be worth 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.530
 you do it now you have to have a 

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:54.440
 entry and an exit is worth to be able 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.280
 Go in and go out 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.720
 ok then you can put them 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.640
 facing it 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:07.320
 from one place to another that you say 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:10.380
 worth it now we say we do with two 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:14.240
 deep eggs 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.240
 here I already have it was for man 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:26.000
 then once you have it with the 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:28.760
 two depth games you put 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.940
 one row like that another us and another has not 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:35.330
 been all the land that you are going to put 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:38.060
 with torches of these evils once not 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.940
 You can put them together because it would be 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:44.150
 It would be worth nothing once you 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.840
 they are willing you take them and what 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.840
 have everything 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:05.410
 it is already had if we take to see here 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:09.280
 a propeller raid that what you do 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:12.220
 It will work on the basis of other like everything 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.670
 that works with the rest so to a certain 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.780
 distance needs 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:23.280
 Well, I'm going to put something against these evils 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:25.620
 we place it and what I have said no 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.900
 you have to put it here below because if 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.500
 you put if you want to put it together for 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.500
 go out to this 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.740
 for diaz that would come together 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.170
 you can not put all the spinners 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.450
 or we would leave them with the most 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.420
 same 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.250
 and all this chain would be released were 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.709
 problems of the environment so if they leave 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.550
 Well, because I'm going to take the extreme 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.550
 would meet 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:01.790
 so 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:05.349
 and once we have it so 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.349
 it only remains to put the wagons 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:11.010
 but if they can not be put that way 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.310
 how you can make a curve can be 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:18.650
 very easy, it does not have to be with the 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.650
 it's worth it, you put one like that 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.620
 and another here and to put it together, take a 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.620
 normal rail 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.620
 and they come together and from the impulse that 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.160
 So it is safe to turn, it is already there 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.310
 very easy 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.290
 and produced this game is to cross in 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.860
 exits a bit shabby because being in 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.870
 creative because it does not do anything, it's worth 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.150
 true that in creative it does not serve to 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.590
 a lot of man is fine if you do it very 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.590
 big so very complicated 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.920
 in your rival or for a being it 's fine 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.550
 entertaining because it takes away your life 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:01.350
 then the challenge of to see if it gets 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:04.940
 spend the biggest and things like that 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:08.390
 today it is very easy to see 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:11.380
 good, well, this, everything, up to another one of the 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.380
