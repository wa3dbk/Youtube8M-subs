00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:09.450
 hi dear viewers of my channel with 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:11.460
 by you I am mana and today I will show you often 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.269
 asked such a question is by 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:18.570
 contact network in trend and now me 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.060
 repeatedly asked questions like 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.550
 the contact network is arranged for such 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:32.430
 net now I apologize and so on an example 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:36.390
 such suspension we will see how 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.079
 they are set to become look always by 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.930
 the grid 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.320
 we have here such a cube circle 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.610
 there must be cubes always but he of course 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:54.289
 doesnâ€™t fit here completely but anyway 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:57.110
 Imagine that we have an arrow like this 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:59.330
 example 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:03.190
 purely on the cubes everything should be 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:06.650
 cubes they specifically so done so 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:10.490
 let's get those contact network mean here 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:17.150
 it hangs with us then the air that means 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:21.229
 just here it goes with us as im dc hl 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:25.010
 l under air force z right to have now 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:29.869
 worth it we take the elevator here it is put here 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:34.040
 so she goes to this side more precisely 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:38.660
 on the contrary, someone comes out of here although no 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:43.310
 and so everything is right here and here 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:46.210
 we move and here somewhere markup on 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.520
 arrow see it is like this 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.820
 all and look carefully what the wire hangs 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.830
 over pin fight apologizing over 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.280
 by rails they are like this somewhere or like that 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:02.600
 should hang clean like thats even 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:09.729
 like that is ruled by love and that's all, and on top 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:09.729
 then we put this type of arched suspension 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:13.299
 So 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:20.439
 there is a little bit of a sure thing but it turns out 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.439
 this is the easiest way some can 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:25.530
 say that this method is not correct i 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:29.290
 you can not disagree a little 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.569
 because for beginners this is the most 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.310
 useful way and if he try 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.590
 now he made me a quick hand 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.489
 see everything is askew 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:42.250
 if we put it here now 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:47.620
 the connection should be aligned 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:51.180
 all here then let's discuss such here 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:54.180
 type of arrows that there concrete 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.180
 means 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:03:00.659
 forgot how crossed both but now me 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:05.949
 never in names 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:14.370
 that means we put like this still 

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:18.900
 consider setting the example for them then out and 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:27.090
 it may either end out 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:27.090
 for on in eu can join like this 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:35.440
 quietly to hold 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:40.940
 all three types of double wire and and well and 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:43.520
 Of course there is such a concrete 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:47.810
 now show you ends 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:58.459
 contact network here successfully put it here 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:04:01.790
 so we connect getting here and all on 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:04.580
 arrows for example like here we have 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.130
 wires must go here between themselves 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:12.830
 intersect I mean watch somehow 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:18.109
 show so for example criss-cross she 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:22.880
 should stand here crosswise 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:24.680
 so so on this perhaps you can 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.260
 finish the video lesson as you see here 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:31.729
 crosswise and also she must everywhere 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:38.030
 be here and no longer criss-cross 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:41.240
 move a little bit more beautiful 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:43.210
 will be if it is of course so will be yes 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.160
 so that's right she should always like that 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.979
 I did this now a quick lesson 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.660
 I apologize if dressed repeated 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:52.310
 what am i doing in haste because 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:55.010
 that I was repeatedly asked to show 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:58.700
 make arrows and arrows on contact 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.360
 network put therefore all thanks for 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.700
 viewing 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.130
 so much so don't comment on that 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.570
 much was repeated just i will do that 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.150
 here fast 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.630
 Thank you all for watching good luck with the trend. 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.630
 bye everyone
