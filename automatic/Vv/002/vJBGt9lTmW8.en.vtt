00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
up on the bus go to wash and we've

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.349 
up on the bus go to wash and we've
sanded<00:00:14.549> that<00:00:16.490> that's<00:00:17.490> where<00:00:17.820> all<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:17.970> water's

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
sanded that that's where all the water's

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.450 
sanded that that's where all the water's
going<00:00:18.570> into<00:00:18.990> so<00:00:19.440> the<00:00:19.740> water<00:00:19.920> actually<00:00:20.100> runs

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
going into so the water actually runs

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.570 
going into so the water actually runs
all<00:00:20.760> throughout<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.210> case<00:00:22.070> all<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.130> way<00:00:23.370> down

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
all throughout the case all the way down

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.320 
all throughout the case all the way down
to<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.760> bottom<00:00:24.380> from<00:00:25.380> your<00:00:25.530> sides<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.330> pretty

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
to the bottom from your sides and pretty

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.390 
to the bottom from your sides and pretty
much<00:00:27.390> flows<00:00:27.990> everywhere<00:00:28.530> around<00:00:28.890> the

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
much flows everywhere around the

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:40.010 
much flows everywhere around the
motherboard<00:00:38.120> alright<00:00:39.120> guys<00:00:39.270> welcome<00:00:39.600> back<00:00:39.780> to

motherboard alright guys welcome back to

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.910 
motherboard alright guys welcome back to
every<00:00:40.200> PC<00:00:40.730> this<00:00:41.730> cut<00:00:42.120> took<00:00:42.450> all<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:43.110> about<00:00:43.440> six

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
every PC this cut took all of about six

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.010 
every PC this cut took all of about six
and<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.070> half<00:00:44.100> hours<00:00:44.600> so<00:00:45.600> what<00:00:45.720> we've<00:00:45.810> done<00:00:45.840> now

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
and a half hours so what we've done now

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.389 
and a half hours so what we've done now
is<00:00:46.230> I've<00:00:46.649> put<00:00:46.860> together<00:00:46.980> this<00:00:47.250> little

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
is I've put together this little

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.090 
is I've put together this little
contraption<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:48.570> make<00:00:48.750> sure<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.200> it's

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
contraption to make sure that it's

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.740 
contraption to make sure that it's
absolutely<00:00:50.550> nine<00:00:50.730> degrees<00:00:51.120> before<00:00:51.329> we<00:00:51.510> start

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
absolutely nine degrees before we start

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.049 
absolutely nine degrees before we start
gluing<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.489> this<00:00:53.489> should<00:00:53.670> give<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:53.910> an

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
gluing it and this should give you an

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:11.120 
gluing it and this should give you an
idea<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.450> the<00:00:56.059> area<00:00:57.059> inside<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.750> case

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.370 

what's<00:01:11.759> happening<00:01:12.060> guys<00:01:12.149> this<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.600> epic<00:01:12.960> pc

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
the legs I've put on project qu and at

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.810 
the legs I've put on project qu and at
the<00:01:24.179> moment<00:01:25.880> it's<00:01:26.880> just<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.479> I'm<00:01:28.579> pretty<00:01:29.579> happy

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
I've got the legs and then down here

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.929 
I've got the legs and then down here
you'll<00:01:36.659> notice<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:37.549> this<00:01:38.549> is<00:01:38.759> for<00:01:38.909> the

you'll notice that this is for the
there's<00:01:39.630> be<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.869> hole<00:01:40.140> here<00:01:40.409> but<00:01:41.189> what's

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
there's be a hole here but what's

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.410 
there's be a hole here but what's
actually<00:01:41.520> gonna<00:01:41.700> happen<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.210> white

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
actually gonna happen is the white

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.880 
actually gonna happen is the white
another<00:01:42.869> white<00:01:43.079> panel<00:01:43.409> is<00:01:43.470> going<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.649> come

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
another white panel is going to come

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.730 
another white panel is going to come
over<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:45.170> all<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.200> way<00:01:46.380> up<00:01:46.500> there

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
over that and all the way up there

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.929 
over that and all the way up there
you'll<00:01:47.729> actually<00:01:47.909> notice<00:01:48.209> the<00:01:48.720> design<00:01:49.939> from

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
you'll actually notice the design from

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.289 
you'll actually notice the design from
the<00:01:51.000> center<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.599> design<00:01:52.159> has<00:01:53.299> actually

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
the center of the design has actually

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.740 
the center of the design has actually
become<00:01:54.740> the<00:01:55.740> legs<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:56.069> the<00:01:56.159> case<00:01:56.340> so<00:01:56.970> the

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
become the legs of the case so the

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.570 
become the legs of the case so the
design<00:01:57.959> for<00:01:58.289> the<00:01:58.380> case<00:01:58.560> has<00:01:58.770> been<00:01:58.950> completely

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
design for the case has been completely

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.440 
design for the case has been completely
integrated<00:02:00.649> same<00:02:01.649> with<00:02:01.799> this<00:02:01.920> as<00:02:02.130> well<00:02:02.450> from

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
integrated same with this as well from

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.910 
integrated same with this as well from
the<00:02:03.539> center<00:02:03.720> point<00:02:03.959> is<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.289> motherboard<00:02:04.740> and

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
the center point is the motherboard and

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.589 
the center point is the motherboard and
the<00:02:05.250> motherboard<00:02:05.640> tray<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.119> same<00:02:06.329> shape

00:02:06.589 --> 00:02:06.599 
the motherboard tray is the same shape

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:08.979 
the motherboard tray is the same shape
and<00:02:06.869> then<00:02:07.560> throughout<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.250> entire<00:02:08.610> case

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
and then throughout the entire case

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:14.420 
and then throughout the entire case
symmetry<00:02:10.310> completely<00:02:11.599> the<00:02:12.599> same<00:02:13.220> design<00:02:14.220> all

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
symmetry completely the same design all

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.199 
symmetry completely the same design all
the<00:02:14.489> way<00:02:14.579> through<00:02:14.910> I<00:02:16.400> don't<00:02:17.400> know<00:02:17.760> where<00:02:18.060> these

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
the way through I don't know where these

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.680 
the way through I don't know where these
pieces<00:02:18.480> have<00:02:18.630> gone<00:02:18.870> actually<00:02:20.299> we<00:02:21.299> have<00:02:21.569> to

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
pieces have gone actually we have to

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:22.640 
pieces have gone actually we have to
recut<00:02:21.989> them<00:02:22.140> because<00:02:22.290> I've<00:02:22.380> looked

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
recut them because I've looked

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.009 
recut them because I've looked
absolutely<00:02:23.250> everywhere<00:02:23.910> from<00:02:24.209> and<00:02:24.540> I<00:02:24.810> just

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
absolutely everywhere from and I just

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.449 
absolutely everywhere from and I just
can't<00:02:25.230> find<00:02:25.440> them<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:25.799> then<00:02:26.190> I'm<00:02:26.280> going<00:02:26.430> to

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
can't find them and then I'm going to

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.259 
can't find them and then I'm going to
put<00:02:26.910> them<00:02:26.970> in<00:02:27.060> place<00:02:27.290> sand<00:02:28.290> it<00:02:28.440> down<00:02:29.269> vacuum

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
put them in place sand it down vacuum

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.569 
put them in place sand it down vacuum
wash<00:02:30.510> it<00:02:30.690> out<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:31.079> then<00:02:31.109> we<00:02:31.709> can<00:02:31.859> steal<00:02:32.100> the

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
wash it out and then we can steal the

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:39.650 
wash it out and then we can steal the
mid<00:02:32.730> plate<00:02:33.739> the<00:02:34.739> bottom<00:02:34.920> plate<00:02:36.109> is<00:02:38.660> installed

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
mid plate the bottom plate is installed

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.050 
mid plate the bottom plate is installed
and<00:02:39.900> you<00:02:40.410> can<00:02:40.530> see<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.739> drain<00:02:41.069> port<00:02:41.340> just<00:02:41.910> in

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
and you can see the drain port just in

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.120 
and you can see the drain port just in
the<00:02:42.120> middle<00:02:42.239> of<00:02:42.389> your<00:02:42.510> screen<00:02:42.660> there<00:02:43.130> so

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
the middle of your screen there so

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.729 
the middle of your screen there so
that's<00:02:44.340> all<00:02:44.519> fine<00:02:44.819> the<00:02:45.540> motherboard<00:02:46.319> I<00:02:46.590> mean

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
that's all fine the motherboard I mean

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.780 
that's all fine the motherboard I mean
the<00:02:46.920> hard<00:02:47.730> drive<00:02:48.000> trays<00:02:48.600> are<00:02:48.840> going<00:02:49.049> there<00:02:49.230> and

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
the hard drive trays are going there and

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.090 
the hard drive trays are going there and
the<00:02:51.109> power<00:02:52.109> supply<00:02:52.290> is<00:02:52.790> going<00:02:53.790> to<00:02:53.880> go<00:02:53.940> there

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
the power supply is going to go there

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.020 
the power supply is going to go there
now<00:02:56.100> this<00:02:56.250> thing<00:02:56.310> is<00:02:56.489> actually<00:02:56.700> getting<00:02:56.940> quite

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
now this thing is actually getting quite

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.160 
now this thing is actually getting quite
heavy<00:02:57.450> as<00:02:57.630> well<00:02:57.840> as<00:02:57.959> I've<00:02:58.109> moved<00:02:58.620> it<00:02:58.739> around<00:02:59.120> I

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
heavy as well as I've moved it around I

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.330 
heavy as well as I've moved it around I
haven't<00:03:01.170> weighed<00:03:01.380> it<00:03:01.530> yet<00:03:01.709> but<00:03:01.889> i'm<00:03:02.040> pretty

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
haven't weighed it yet but i'm pretty

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.940 
haven't weighed it yet but i'm pretty
sure<00:03:02.700> it's<00:03:02.880> in<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.239> 20<00:03:03.810> to<00:03:03.930> 30<00:03:04.139> kilogram<00:03:04.680> range

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
sure it's in the 20 to 30 kilogram range

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.339 
sure it's in the 20 to 30 kilogram range
at<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.220> moment<00:03:05.540> because<00:03:06.540> all<00:03:06.959> of<00:03:07.019> those

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
at the moment because all of those

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.870 
at the moment because all of those
panels<00:03:07.739> are<00:03:08.310> 10<00:03:08.760> mil<00:03:09.000> and<00:03:09.209> then<00:03:09.630> the<00:03:09.780> legs<00:03:10.880> four

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
panels are 10 mil and then the legs four

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.199 
panels are 10 mil and then the legs four
panels<00:03:12.630> each<00:03:13.160> four<00:03:14.160> panels<00:03:14.519> of<00:03:14.670> three<00:03:14.700> mils<00:03:15.120> of

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
panels each four panels of three mils of

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.559 
panels each four panels of three mils of
their<00:03:15.359> 12<00:03:15.630> mil<00:03:15.840> thick<00:03:16.109> all<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.739> way<00:03:16.859> across

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569 
their 12 mil thick all the way across

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:20.629 
their 12 mil thick all the way across
they<00:03:18.569> take<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:18.810> way<00:03:18.989> of<00:03:19.109> the<00:03:19.199> case<00:03:19.440> quite<00:03:20.370> well

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:20.639 
they take the way of the case quite well

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:24.140 
they take the way of the case quite well
I've<00:03:21.150> got<00:03:21.180> no<00:03:21.600> problems<00:03:22.049> about<00:03:22.259> that<00:03:22.440> and<00:03:22.680> then

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
I've got no problems about that and then

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.000 
I've got no problems about that and then
yeah<00:03:24.420> i<00:03:24.689> mean<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:24.989> back<00:03:25.140> support<00:03:25.319> is<00:03:25.620> 10<00:03:25.829> mil

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
yeah i mean the back support is 10 mil

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.339 
yeah i mean the back support is 10 mil
thick<00:03:26.220> so<00:03:26.459> you<00:03:26.700> don't<00:03:27.180> really<00:03:27.360> need<00:03:27.659> any<00:03:27.959> more

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
thick so you don't really need any more

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.440 
thick so you don't really need any more
on<00:03:28.470> that<00:03:28.680> this<00:03:29.310> isn't<00:03:29.640> the<00:03:29.730> final<00:03:29.909> grill<00:03:30.299> this

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
on that this isn't the final grill this

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.630 
on that this isn't the final grill this
is<00:03:30.599> a<00:03:30.629> gorilla<00:03:31.019> these<00:03:31.769> are<00:03:31.890> the<00:03:32.010> grills<00:03:32.250> I<00:03:32.430> will

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
is a gorilla these are the grills I will

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.449 
is a gorilla these are the grills I will
be<00:03:32.819> selling<00:03:33.209> on<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.890> website<00:03:34.890> and<00:03:35.159> I'll<00:03:35.310> be

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
be selling on the website and I'll be

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.300 
be selling on the website and I'll be
designing<00:03:35.879> a<00:03:36.030> few<00:03:36.239> more<00:03:36.420> but<00:03:36.989> um<00:03:37.170> that's<00:03:38.040> one

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
designing a few more but um that's one

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.240 
designing a few more but um that's one
of<00:03:38.430> them<00:03:38.579> and<00:03:39.260> all<00:03:40.260> that<00:03:40.409> does<00:03:40.590> is<00:03:40.620> it<00:03:40.859> just

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
of them and all that does is it just

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.069 
of them and all that does is it just
simply<00:03:41.430> goes<00:03:41.700> in<00:03:41.879> there<00:03:42.230> like<00:03:43.230> so<00:03:43.560> so

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
simply goes in there like so so

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:47.750 
simply goes in there like so so
basically<00:03:46.079> that<00:03:46.140> fan<00:03:46.530> blows<00:03:46.829> air<00:03:47.159> straight

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
basically that fan blows air straight

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.399 
basically that fan blows air straight
onto<00:03:47.909> the<00:03:48.120> two<00:03:48.329> hard<00:03:48.569> drives<00:03:48.689> right<00:03:49.019> there<00:03:49.230> and

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:49.409 
onto the two hard drives right there and

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:52.819 
onto the two hard drives right there and
then<00:03:49.980> it<00:03:50.099> goes<00:03:50.629> in<00:03:51.629> behind<00:03:52.200> the<00:03:52.379> back<00:03:52.560> plate

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
then it goes in behind the back plate

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:56.259 
then it goes in behind the back plate
and<00:03:53.329> travels<00:03:54.329> up<00:03:54.540> behind<00:03:55.109> them<00:03:55.379> back<00:03:55.620> plate

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
and travels up behind them back plate

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.839 
and travels up behind them back plate
until<00:03:57.269> it<00:03:57.510> reaches<00:03:57.930> the<00:03:58.139> top<00:03:58.680> there<00:03:58.920> where

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
until it reaches the top there where

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:03.949 
until it reaches the top there where
it's<00:04:00.000> exhausted<00:04:00.769> now<00:04:02.510> because<00:04:03.510> the<00:04:03.690> water<00:04:03.870> is

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
it's exhausted now because the water is

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.500 
it's exhausted now because the water is
being<00:04:04.139> routed<00:04:04.349> through<00:04:04.709> here<00:04:05.209> all<00:04:06.209> of<00:04:06.480> that

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
being routed through here all of that

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.740 
being routed through here all of that
becomes<00:04:07.200> one<00:04:08.040> big<00:04:08.069> heat<00:04:08.459> sink<00:04:08.489> and<00:04:08.909> plastic<00:04:09.659> is

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
becomes one big heat sink and plastic is

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.379 
becomes one big heat sink and plastic is
a<00:04:09.780> terrible<00:04:10.349> heat<00:04:11.159> sink<00:04:11.459> but<00:04:11.760> it's<00:04:12.090> better

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389 
a terrible heat sink but it's better

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:15.379 
a terrible heat sink but it's better
than<00:04:12.540> nothing<00:04:12.900> so<00:04:13.680> having<00:04:14.639> the<00:04:14.760> airflow<00:04:15.150> back

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:15.389 
than nothing so having the airflow back

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:18.379 
than nothing so having the airflow back
there<00:04:15.720> will<00:04:16.260> definitely<00:04:16.709> help<00:04:16.889> with<00:04:17.389> with

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
there will definitely help with with

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.089 
there will definitely help with with
reducing<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.019> temperature<00:04:19.199> especially

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:20.099 
reducing the temperature especially

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:21.920 
reducing the temperature especially
since<00:04:20.250> I'm<00:04:20.459> cooling<00:04:20.820> pretty<00:04:21.449> much<00:04:21.570> everything

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
since I'm cooling pretty much everything

somewhere<00:04:37.440> I<00:04:37.620> mean<00:04:38.010> this<00:04:38.099> is<00:04:38.220> all<00:04:38.370> pretty<00:04:38.580> much

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
somewhere I mean this is all pretty much

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.469 
somewhere I mean this is all pretty much
done<00:04:39.169> this<00:04:40.169> week<00:04:40.440> this<00:04:40.860> was<00:04:41.039> done<00:04:41.220> a<00:04:41.250> week<00:04:41.520> so

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 
done this week this was done a week so

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:45.430 
done this week this was done a week so
we're<00:04:43.229> not<00:04:43.320> doing<00:04:43.530> too<00:04:43.680> bad<00:04:43.860> at<00:04:43.949> the<00:04:44.039> time<00:04:44.389> I

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
we're not doing too bad at the time I

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.310 
we're not doing too bad at the time I
actually<00:04:46.440> slated<00:04:47.130> that<00:04:47.280> the<00:04:47.810> this<00:04:48.810> project
