let's<00:01:48.670> let's<00:01:49.030> get<00:01:49.150> out<00:01:49.270> of<00:01:49.300> there<00:01:49.540> I<00:01:49.750> wonder<00:01:50.380> if

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
let's let's get out of there I wonder if

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.770 
let's let's get out of there I wonder if
they<00:01:50.740> will<00:01:50.890> actually<00:01:51.310> walk<00:01:51.730> like<00:01:52.570> the

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
they will actually walk like the

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.870 
they will actually walk like the
intended<00:01:53.290> model<00:01:53.710> is<00:01:53.860> supposed<00:01:54.190> to<00:01:54.250> walk<00:01:54.520> so

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
intended model is supposed to walk so

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.720 
intended model is supposed to walk so
let's<00:01:55.060> give<00:01:55.300> that<00:01:55.330> a<00:01:55.510> look<00:01:55.810> yes<00:01:56.800> they<00:01:57.160> do<00:01:57.220> well

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
let's give that a look yes they do well

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.150 
let's give that a look yes they do well
that's<00:01:57.940> really<00:01:58.210> cool<00:01:58.420> then<00:01:58.600> I<00:01:59.500> mean<00:01:59.920> I<00:02:00.010> don't

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
that's really cool then I mean I don't

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.620 
that's really cool then I mean I don't
know<00:02:00.250> what<00:02:00.400> else<00:02:00.520> I'd<00:02:00.640> look<00:02:00.820> like<00:02:00.850> maybe<00:02:01.300> maybe

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
know what else I'd look like maybe maybe

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.000 
know what else I'd look like maybe maybe
the<00:02:01.780> animation<00:02:02.170> wouldn't<00:02:02.440> work<00:02:02.590> who<00:02:02.800> knows

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
the animation wouldn't work who knows

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.520 
the animation wouldn't work who knows
but<00:02:03.670> yeah<00:02:04.210> you<00:02:04.270> can<00:02:04.570> pretty<00:02:04.720> much<00:02:04.810> transform

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
but yeah you can pretty much transform

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.950 
but yeah you can pretty much transform
it<00:02:05.650> and<00:02:05.800> do<00:02:05.890> anything<00:02:06.190> I<00:02:06.610> really<00:02:07.300> like<00:02:07.600> just

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
trying to use pretty funny to see

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.800 
trying to use pretty funny to see
yourself<00:02:09.610> walking<00:02:09.759> around<00:02:10.060> you<00:02:10.209> can't<00:02:10.450> really

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
yourself walking around you can't really

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.360

with<00:03:14.650> like<00:03:14.770> a<00:03:14.860> stake<00:03:15.130> in<00:03:15.280> the<00:03:15.340> GUI<00:03:15.820> you<00:03:15.880> could

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
with like a stake in the GUI you could

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.120 
with like a stake in the GUI you could
actually<00:03:16.239> change<00:03:16.570> them<00:03:16.690> with<00:03:16.780> say<00:03:16.959> a<00:03:16.989> block<00:03:17.350> so

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
actually change them with say a block so

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.060 
actually change them with say a block so
see<00:03:18.670> if<00:03:18.820> we<00:03:19.000> just<00:03:19.270> grab<00:03:19.450> like<00:03:19.930> I<00:03:20.200> don't<00:03:20.320> know<00:03:20.709> a

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
see if we just grab like I don't know a

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.890 
see if we just grab like I don't know a
mushroom<00:03:21.730> and<00:03:22.000> I<00:03:22.090> right-click<00:03:22.360> him

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
mushroom and I right-click him

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.120 
mushroom and I right-click him
with<00:03:23.049> it<00:03:23.200> he<00:03:23.350> would<00:03:23.530> turn<00:03:23.709> into<00:03:23.860> like<00:03:24.100> a

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
with it he would turn into like a

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.280 
with it he would turn into like a
mushroom<00:03:24.489> something<00:03:25.480> like<00:03:25.600> that<00:03:25.780> instead<00:03:26.200> of

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
mushroom something like that instead of

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.780 
mushroom something like that instead of
just<00:03:26.440> doing<00:03:26.620> it<00:03:26.799> like<00:03:26.950> this<00:03:27.160> that<00:03:27.220> was<00:03:27.549> kind<00:03:27.730> of

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
just doing it like this that was kind of

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.750 
just doing it like this that was kind of
costly<00:03:28.239> other<00:03:29.200> things<00:03:29.680> are<00:03:29.980> like<00:03:30.160> you<00:03:30.459> can<00:03:30.580> put

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
costly other things are like you can put

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.400 
costly other things are like you can put
them<00:03:30.850> in<00:03:30.910> a<00:03:31.030> book<00:03:31.390> that<00:03:31.420> you<00:03:31.660> can<00:03:31.780> store<00:03:32.260> away

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
them in a book that you can store away

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.160 
them in a book that you can store away
