00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.720
 afternoons guys and girls this time 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.270
 let's talk about what we breathe 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:14.270
 divers there will be people who do not even 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:16.880
 like it and that you do not know what really 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.740
 breathe there is not much balloon negotiators 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.900
 we breathe oxygen when in fact what 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.210
 that you breathe is good compressed air 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.000
 in this section the only thing that we are not going to 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.590
 pay is how we put the air 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.090
 in the bottles in this case then 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.580
 we use an air compressor 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.340
 compressed that does not get the air to 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.489
 Pressure between 200-300 several depending 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.010
 of the type of bottle that we use 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:42.440
 right here on the table 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:46.010
 we have disassembled what are the parts 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.420
 air filters not in this in this 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.129
 occasion with this side I do not have my 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.530
 hand is the intake filter of the 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.019
 compressor which good then in this 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.329
 case every 25 hours we must turn 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:57.559
 that we have a black part that was 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.109
 obscured that is the part that was 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.309
 working to date and another part 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:03.769
 that is white that is the one in this 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.840
 chance we will have to use to 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.220
 filter this would be the first part 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.420
 filter that is the air that enters the 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.310
 compressor 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.360
 the air leaving the compressor goes to 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.920
 through some filters that are 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.659
 compounds in this case we have here the 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.869
 Dismantled filter is an aluminum tube 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:20.840
 which inside will accommodate the 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:23.049
 material that I will explain in this 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.869
 given in my hand and on my left side 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:29.869
 we have little balls called albumin 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:33.110
 which are drying particles that are treated 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:35.539
 simply to retain moisture and 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.610
 liquids that air can contain here 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:39.740
 we have a part of the albumin that 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.229
 is used in state we have a small 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.300
 little bit of what a woman would be 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.040
 clean albumin no 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.430
 you see there is a difference in hue 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:52.070
 which it is much darker than that used to 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.040
 The index of what he was holding 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.750
 liquid then we have a little more 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.580
 ahead what would be the last part 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.890
 filter that would be active carbon 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.470
 in this coal is very similar to that which 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.580
 used for aquariums and others but 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.050
 with the only difference that good 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.540
 is a little more filtered so that 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.760
 contain dust or anything like that and 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:14.430
 is let's say the one that takes away the let's say 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.200
 the harmful particles of the air and others 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.620
 and other elements that are not 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.500
 breathable 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.930
 and well, the air would go to 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.879
 Perfectly clean bottle is very 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.730
 important that maintenance be 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:31.540
 regular machine so it does not 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:34.360
 generate odors or damage to those who breathe 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.709
 in this case good every 50 hours then 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.200
 we have to change all this that you are 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.380
 watching here for people to breathe 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.380
 cleansed 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.720
 there is no indication that the air is not 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.490
 it's fine is the smell itself that you can 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.710
 find through breathing or 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.319
 if you guys are in the air through 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.260
 of the regulator 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:55.239
 is that something something is not right if it smells 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.109
 some and the air smells bad really not 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.680
 has color to nothing 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:01.989
 the air is tasteless then good if 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.849
 you have some problem of that type 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.409
 you have to first check with the 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.329
 person with whom you do the loads 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.920
 where do the charges just in case 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.180
 it was from the compressor but not 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.519
 it necessarily has to be from 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.379
 compressor can also be generated by 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:18.540
 liquids that we have inside it 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:21.669
 bottle water oils and others and 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.010
 just that the helmet is dirty 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:25.840
 It has some rust or whatever all 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.370
 that always generates odor in the air is not 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.490
 an index that can give us a bit of 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.160
 alarm 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:33.380
 and nothing else in this case what we're going to 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.750
 to pass is to teach what the machine is 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:39.110
 itself the one that loads the bottles 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:42.430
 the idea of what it is that puts us 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.430
 the air in the cylinders 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.650
 very good guys look like 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.720
 we said before we have approached now 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.819
 to the machine in which it contained the 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.620
 filters those that we have shown to 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:57.110
 that you see what the device really is 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.240
 that puts the air in our bottles of 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.490
 diving in this case you see that it is a 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.560
 apparatus of blue color full of little clock 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.360
 and buttons that good I'll try 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.140
 explain a bit what each one consists of 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.760
 one of them 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.209
 in this case we have a compressor 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.920
 what is double takes half that a 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.380
 normal compressor and load a bottle 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.440
 usually a normal charger takes 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.780
 about 20 minutes in this case we talked 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.580
 of what is the bottle that we have there 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.400
 hooked for example 15 liters 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.480
 it took us about five minutes in 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.220
 load it 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.350
 it is important to emphasize that but good 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.380
 many times we despair waiting 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.640
 for the load on the other hand, you see a 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.419
 lots of little watches that I will go 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:40.669
 pointing to this manometer that you see here 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:43.160
 it marks the pressure of the third stage 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:45.830
 of the compressor is to say the pressure in the 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.480
 which is at that moment of loading the 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.630
 that we have just below 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:53.720
 It is also a manometer only 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.760
 what is the action of a prisoner this 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.010
 means that automatically the 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.620
 compressor when you reach the pressure that 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.330
 we manually dial you 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.800
 the little buttons have a little less 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.919
 of importance because the only thing that 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.050
 is about the start of the stop and 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:10.729
 the flea we can play it 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.500
 automatically that is the case that this 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:14.199
 compressor purges automatically but 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.610
 we can also do it manually 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:18.350
 well we have some rolls that we 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.120
 mark work hours through 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.710
 which we are governed for the time of 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.500
 change the filters as before 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.630
 we saw another important part 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.340
 is this level that we see here that we 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.900
 marks the level of oil that the 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.910
 compressor in every moment is very 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.320
 important that the oil is preserved 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.970
 between the first and the second mark 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.970
 recent the minimum the maximum with 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:40.070
 any engine no longer just for no longer 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:43.370
 only for the life of the compressor itself 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:45.170
 but that the excess consumption of 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.910
 oil tells us that something is wrong in the 

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:48.920
 compressor and that we can be getting 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:52.220
 oil in the air not in this case you see 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:56.290
 which is at the proper levels these 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:58.669
 tubes here that you see gray are 

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:00.260
 let's say the filter housing that we have 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:02.840
 seen before here are introduced the 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:05.720
 filters through which we send 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:08.000
 to the bottle and down here 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:11.000
 we have manual fleas too 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.770
 to empty the water of what is the 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.930
 filter in case we see that there 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:17.870
 too much humidity in the environment 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:20.440
 and for the rest, nothing more in this 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:22.970
 consists of the compressor that you are seeing 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:25.280
 I would say that it must be one of the 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:28.880
 most powerful compressors we have in 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:31.310
 the area would even say that commercially 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:34.190
 they are the fastest 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.540
 and for my part this time I think that 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:38.280
 nothing else I hope you liked the 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:40.850
 program see you later 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.850
 for me
