00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:06.840
Hey everyone! I am making this video, because
I want to talk about my experience with yoga.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:13.829
And I will try to make it as brief as possible,
because YouTube keeps cutting me off anyway.

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:19.869
So I want to just basically say that it is
not what it seems. It is extremely dangerous!

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:26.720
I have a lot of experience in this, I was
involved in high level occult yoga for a few

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.619
years. And I was doing it for 15 hours a day
of yoga. And I was just about ready to completely

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:39.619
give my life to this organization and I was
about ready to move to India. And I was in

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.989
India and was hit with spiritual warfare while
doing this yoga, because it opens you up to

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.989
a different dimension. And I thought I was
becoming enlightened, because I was feeling

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:58.460
good. Before I got hit with spiritual warfare,
I was feeling good and that is the deception!

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.949
Just because something feels good, it does
not mean it is coming from a good place. Satan

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.450
can do healings and has done healings and
I have seen that as well. And so, the deception

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.280
is just so deep - it is unimaginable - that
it can be anything bad. I mean, it seems harmless

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.020
right? You are just doing some stretches - what
is wrong with that? We would seem totally

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:26.020
wacko to even suggest otherwise but it truly
is not what it seems. And I was doing this

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:34.259
high level yoga, and I got hit with spiritual
warfare, I got hit with physical illness and

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:43.180
very serious morgellons disease. And I came
back devastated from it, and I will get into

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:49.689
my journey in a second but I just want to
say again and reiterate the fact that - everything

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:54.610
is a trade off. Just because it feels good
does not mean that it is coming from a good

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.990
place, as I mentioned. And there might be
something else that it is affected, because

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.759
if you look at the origins and the roots of
yoga and you really look at where it is coming

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:10.080
from, it truly is witchcraft! And as crazy
as that sounds, it sounds like something you

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:17.640
would here some so-called ignorant person
as I am stereotyping, from the South (from

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.840
Southern States of the U.S.). Saying, “Oh
you know those yoga people there, just doing

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.830
that voodoo over there! And I never left this
town my whole life and I know that voodoo

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.550
stuff is just not for me! You know, whatever!”
And I love Southern people, please do not

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.330
get me wrong, but I am saying that you may
think that it is just something that is so

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.470
far-fetched or out there (crazy). That only
some ignorant person would say, but I am speaking

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.570
from experience - high level experience in
this. For many years, I was involved and I

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.430
was a poster child for this (was an advocate
for yoga). And I tell you that this is not

00:02:52.430 --> 00:03:00.460
what it seems and I came back (to the U.S.)
and I was seeing images of Satan as a dragon

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.300
with wings and did not even know what it meant.
I did not like Christians, I did not like

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.720
anything to do with Christianity because I
associated Christianity with mainstream Christianity

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:16.720
- which is heresy and with the Catholic Church
and with the Crusades and what we see manifesting

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.200
as Christian Zionism and Dominionism (Dominion
Theology) which I discussed in the reference

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.410
document (see description below). But that
is what I had associated with Christianity,

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:31.930
so it took some time for me to come to the
place of trying to call upon Jesus through

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:41.130
this experience. And I did! I came to call
upon Jesus Christ, through this experience

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:47.480
for health and healing and hope, during the
spiritual warfare. And He came! He came, and

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:56.320
He came strong! And through His name, He showed
me that there is just no other name that could

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.590
have done what He did for me. And these spirits
inside me just got ‘rattled up’ (nervous)

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.430
and did not like it. And at the same time,
the Lord was showing me biblical prophecy

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:15.350
coming true and led me to write that reference
document. And I got saved and my whole life

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:20.180
changed! All the anger and the weird stuff
that was happening that was getting out of

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:29.940
control! I just felt an amazing amount of
peace and even my parents see a tangible difference.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:36.120
And so, what I would like to just say is that
Jesus Christ is the Way! He has shown me out

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.480
of the deception of yoga and what it is and
the occult and there is something happening

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.720
now where it is entering into the Church.
Apostasy is entering the Church and I would

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:52.580
like to just quickly mention there is a documentary
by Andrew Strom and it is called, “Shocking

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.860
Documentary 1.” You can just search YouTube
for “Shocking Documentary 1” about false spirits

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:02.400
invading the Church. And what you are seeing
there is the twitching and the grunting and

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.470
the moaning and the groaning and the rolling
and all the stuff that I was involved in,

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.810
that type of stuff manifested when I thought
that I was getting enlightened. That those

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:14.600
spirits which are actually doing it, are entering
into the Church now, and it is not coming

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.060
from a good place. So, check out that documentary
as well (see description)! And I would just

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:23.320
like to say, even if you think that I am totally,
whacked out, crazy, or that yoga can not be

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:29.270
that bad. I ask you to look further and you
can contact me and I can tell you more details

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:37.400
because truly, even if you are feeling good
- it has consequences and I would just stay

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:44.400
away from it! It is actual witchcraft taking
place, which as crazy as it sounds - is true!

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:50.070
And I only know from very personal experience
and I am not the only one! So do research

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.950
on it. I love you all, God bless!

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:53.850
End
