00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
those who use low sensitivity for more

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.529 
those who use low sensitivity for more
accuracy<00:00:58.440> which<00:00:59.190> requires<00:00:59.579> more<00:00:59.940> movement<00:01:00.390> on

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
accuracy which requires more movement on

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.799
