00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
with so much ice bucket challenging

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.490 
with so much ice bucket challenging
happening<00:00:03.210> we<00:00:03.540> thought<00:00:03.750> we'd<00:00:03.929> get<00:00:04.110> in<00:00:04.170> on<00:00:04.380> the

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
happening we thought we'd get in on the

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.230 
happening we thought we'd get in on the
action<00:00:04.620> and<00:00:04.920> to<00:00:04.980> those<00:00:05.549> people<00:00:05.910> who<00:00:06.029> think

action and to those people who think

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.730 
action and to those people who think
they're<00:00:06.359> too<00:00:06.569> good<00:00:06.810> to<00:00:06.960> do<00:00:07.080> the<00:00:07.200> challenge<00:00:07.440> I

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
they're too good to do the challenge I

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.110 
they're too good to do the challenge I
say<00:00:08.069> shame<00:00:08.429> on<00:00:08.670> you

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
say shame on you

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.450 
say shame on you
I'm<00:00:09.450> looking<00:00:09.870> at<00:00:09.960> you<00:00:10.139> Stephen<00:00:10.559> Hawking<00:00:10.860> but

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
I'm looking at you Stephen Hawking but

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.950 
I'm looking at you Stephen Hawking but
anyways<00:00:11.790> we<00:00:12.059> are<00:00:12.179> here<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.450> shed<00:00:12.719> some<00:00:12.900> light

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
anyways we are here to shed some light

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.250 
anyways we are here to shed some light
on<00:00:13.259> that<00:00:13.380> mysterious<00:00:14.070> substance<00:00:14.549> ice<00:00:15.020> so<00:00:16.020> here

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
on that mysterious substance ice so here

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.040 
on that mysterious substance ice so here
it<00:00:16.350> is<00:00:16.529> bet<00:00:17.130> you<00:00:17.340> didn't<00:00:17.609> know<00:00:17.640> ice<00:00:18.270> edition<00:00:18.810> I

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
it is bet you didn't know ice edition I

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.870 
it is bet you didn't know ice edition I
bet<00:00:19.830> you<00:00:19.980> didn't<00:00:20.189> know<00:00:20.310> that<00:00:20.340> before<00:00:20.520> the

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
bet you didn't know that before the

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.269 
bet you didn't know that before the
advent<00:00:21.060> of<00:00:21.390> freon<00:00:21.840> based<00:00:22.109> refrigeration<00:00:22.890> ice

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
advent of freon based refrigeration ice

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.220 
advent of freon based refrigeration ice
was<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.699> only<00:00:23.850> way<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.269> keep<00:00:24.510> things<00:00:24.689> cool<00:00:25.019> and

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
was the only way to keep things cool and

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.259 
was the only way to keep things cool and
ice<00:00:25.769> harvesting<00:00:26.010> was<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.460> huge<00:00:26.789> business

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
ice harvesting was a huge business

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.419 
ice harvesting was a huge business
around<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.960> turn<00:00:28.109> of<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.320> century<00:00:28.470> basically

around the turn of the century basically

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.130 
around the turn of the century basically
it<00:00:29.519> was<00:00:29.640> those<00:00:29.789> dudes<00:00:30.029> from<00:00:30.150> frozen<00:00:30.390> without

you know what I think I've said too much

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.970 
you know what I think I've said too much
I<00:00:54.360> bet<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.140> didn't<00:00:55.350> know<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.500> commercial

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
structure of the ice crystals that give

them<00:01:21.990> different<00:01:22.200> properties<00:01:22.830> for<00:01:23.610> example

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
them different properties for example

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.359 
them different properties for example
ice<00:01:24.270> 11<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:24.990> ferroelectric<00:01:25.740> exhibiting

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
ice 11 is ferroelectric exhibiting

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.700 
ice 11 is ferroelectric exhibiting
electric<00:01:26.790> polarization<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.689> ice<00:01:28.140> 3<00:01:28.470> has<00:01:28.680> a

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
electric polarization and ice 3 has a

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.469 
electric polarization and ice 3 has a
crystal<00:01:29.100> structure<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.909> makes<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.240> more

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
crystal structure that makes it more

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.539 
crystal structure that makes it more
dense<00:01:30.720> than<00:01:30.960> water<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.530> it'll<00:01:31.979> sink<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:32.460> a

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
dense than water so it'll sink in a

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.789 
dense than water so it'll sink in a
glass<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.850> water<00:01:33.060> so<00:01:33.689> this<00:01:33.869> means<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.320> ice<00:01:34.530> 9

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
glass of water so this means that ice 9

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.520 
glass of water so this means that ice 9
