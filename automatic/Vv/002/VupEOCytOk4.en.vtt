00:00:01.519 --> 00:00:04.519
 one 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:11.059
 the Argentine team debuted in the Copa America 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.489
 introduced a great disappointment an essence of what was expected to see a 

00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:15.959
 rival like bolivia 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:18.960
 in the debut in a local tournament 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.199
 start to show your might 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.770
 to include abbot part is batista who did not want it originally tevez arrived 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:28.679
 by popular pressure 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:30.979
 first you have to be annoying 

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:35.120
 heartbreak team because he put Mascherano as the last man as if 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.220
 was a book in front of balance and burdisso and sent lateral muds to 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.609
 middle of the court threw are already here because to try to be able 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:46.640
 get an overflow that 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.580
 percent 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.830
 denounced the absence of di maría 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.380
 tevez played in that awkward position on the left the reality the team 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.460
 was left to what he could create 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.630
 lionel messi 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.550
 and this is another point this is another point if lionel messi plays in the middle of the 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.350
 court and starts to pull from the middle of the court men 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.050
 once it may happen that reaching the goal in another may give a pass to another in another 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.200
 wheel do not pass the visit 7 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.130
 the river from the serve line and win it 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.650
 it does not serve as misia and 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.360
 and also produces a state of vertigo please so chaos that your team could 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.870
 who accompany him do not have the speed and precision of him 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.430
 then everyone says and shares 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.190
 that messi is the best of all is the best player in the world now that is the 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.890
 The best player in the world the one with the greatest skill possible 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.380
 imbalance greater goalscorer capacity and greater speed 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.870
 but this does not mean that conceptually you can manage a team 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.750
 and then the confusion arises because it has long been believed that 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.869
 puts Messi as the axis of the team Messi is an extraordinary striker 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:58.730
 but it's not enough 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.499
 the team messenger because he swears vertically at full speed 

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:03.910
 the midnight 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:09.140
 then n the leprosy selection needs to have someone who thinks that someone who 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.350
 because you can spend in the making of the ball something short actors is not 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.390
 Once again team that would be the indicated but good is not very clear 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.329
 in the injury 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:18.880
 maybe when I grazed 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.880
 instead of cambiasso you can get a partnership with messi 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:25.760
 to the contribution that may be banega that did not play well 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.250
 you can build game circuit the game circuits as they say here 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.959
 streets 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.099
 have possession of the ball 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.870
 we have to play touch and this and have patience none of the three 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.009
 things and his team in front of bolivia 

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:42.639
 that all the coach's speech did not work 

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:46.489
 you have to rethink and you have to understand that messi is an extraordinary player 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:52.150
 who arrived instead of leaving the court may also need a 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.030
 nine reference in the area 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.589
 and messi when the poorest place 

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:58.779
 coming out from the right 

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:03.099
 heller this area of ​​batista found the functioning of your team because the 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:07.539
 party with colombia in santa fe on Wednesday or the day after tomorrow can 

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:09.769
 bring difficulties if it will not be
