 We're being six like you are. 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.650
 set up your printer which is via wifi 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.540
 good 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.340
 the first thing you need to set up 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.770
 wifi né 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.289
 If you want to configure it will have a 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.840
 tutorial on a channel only you go there on 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.010
 channel video tutorial configure the 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.019
 wifi 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.010
 Then you'll buy a printer. 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:33.450
 or if you have you will call there right 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.730
 and then you'll have to create a drive 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.390
 for her you do you come here to 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.800
 start the device on a good printer 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.170
 will appear all the devices 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:52.199
 printer was everything now and there 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:57.629
 you are going to create or understand or is to do 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:01:01.820
 device by treasure is good and I 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:06.119
 I have two here as you can see and 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:08.549
 cable is the same as the cable 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.220
 another is via wifi 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.400
 Good, I 'm calling the printer now. 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:18.030
 she will recognize the wifi is and when 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:24.180
 to recognize it will not stay this way but 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:30.840
 will get colored and hurt you maybe not 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:32.909
 I know but I hoped I would show you again 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.650
 this video as you set it up 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:41.130
 so first thing you need 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:45.570
 do is turn the printer on 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:48.270
 wi fi device 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:53.159
 good you go in our strength in your 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:57.360
 router and then the following your router 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:02:00.869
 he's going to have it he'll have to have the wps 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:04.079
 that she will speak and protect said tap 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:07.140
 what is the purpose of setting up another 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:10.920
 router or configure a device 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.480
 like another router a printer is 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.590
 what 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.190
 but it's notebooks too 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:21.860
 are on mobile 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:31.250
 ok then you go on the wps part and it goes 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:34.099
 here has been added since 2001 or for three 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:39.470
 seconds ten minutes how many company 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:41.900
 is asking the wifi button will there have the 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.280
 button f5 will press and will 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:48.230
 here o 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:50.329
 if the nipple is two minutes in the case 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.090
 will spend two minutes you 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:55.340
 pressing there and will connect as soon as 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:59.450
 You press connect, you press there. 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:02.299
 teacher dream is 2 thousand euros on the button 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:10.040
 the wifi and it will connect 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:15.829
 let 's her is connected connected is 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:21.200
 or you print the information that goes 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:23.510
 show being the address mac is the id of 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.450
 printer to see if you do not have 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.660
 another person to your network 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.829
 Good thing is you checked your network with 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.340
 password 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:37.160
 because if anyone has another notebook 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.019
 got name of your network group 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.079
 he will be able to print something on your 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:44.419
 printer or if you have nothing 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:46.730
 no a group of redd it goes 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:49.609
 able to print directly then 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.400
 example can take a picture will be high 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:56.780
 print quality on printers 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.590
 If you have is paper and then only ink 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.989
 go away 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:05.419
 This is it so for you, this is having a 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:09.049
 most recommended security and 

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:14.150
 router after being here 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:18.590
 in the year to start devices and printer 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:21.859
 and here ó this is where the key but can 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:24.240
 here is to add a printer that will 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.669
 have windows 7 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:30.810
 and you go here and add a 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:32.849
 wireless or bluetooth network printer 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:37.800
 and there will appear all the devices 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:40.470
 Have via bluetooth or via wifi 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:44.310
 your computer or your router if you 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:48.330
 case your computer has a 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:50.789
 wimax wifi network is internal or external 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:57.270
 inside him in case 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:05:02.270
 I do not know but you're going to 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:05.400
 address you use through the browser 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.650
 or you can be used by 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:11.340
 computer on your computer network 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:15.960
 right here 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:19.610
 I use what is this the use of entering the 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.610
 browser and I will move forward 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:28.550
 he will look at this really right and 

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:33.180
 then he will show you several manufacturers 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:36.180
 and several models for you chose me 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:42.300
 I recommend that you really 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:44.280
 model in the case of model x in the case 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:47.340
 back to this message for me 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:51.449
 because I already created here 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:57.360
 recreating the same then I'll use the 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:06:00.860
 that is already installed and I'm going to put 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:06.060
 practically the same name here 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:08.099
 He tries to recognize the same thing you 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.870
 can delete the devices do not have 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:13.349
 problem if it does not work 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:18.690
 then he will say that it already exists it is logical 

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:21.919
 So why do you two and he's going? 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.919
 install normally 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:29.280
 good comes the part that it is that you will have 

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:33.660
 define whether you want to share or 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:36.510
 not in case it depends a lot if you have 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:41.070
 a good security on your router in the 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:44.420
 if you do not share this printer 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:47.940
 or share and you have a local 

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:50.700
 comment and local t7 you define location 

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:54.840
 that she is and comment you comment on the 

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:59.420
 that is wanted, for example, to divide or 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:59.420
 same person with your neighbor for example 

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:08.130
 advances and you have set a default 

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:11.100
 the test is not 

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:14.910
 so it's here she's going to stay 

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:17.370
 colored is when it's gray so it's 

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:19.350
 because she is off and when she 

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:21.540
 It's so colorful because it's 

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:24.810
 not connected 

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:36.540
 so folks this is basically you already 

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:37.470
 If you can get to print world, it 's just 

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:43.490
 you 

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:48.120
 the device you want in this case here 

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:53.580
 and I'll ask you to print it right here 

00:07:48.120 --> 00:08:00.150
 will inform the device you have 

00:07:53.580 --> 00:08:03.680
 standard that fixes the case of q2 ee already 

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:03.680
 start printing 

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:11.250
 so this is what I hope you liked 

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:14.700
 of another video reminding any 

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:17.220
 Doubt that they're sending it to me. 

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:19.490
 so that's it folks said and even 

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.490
 more
