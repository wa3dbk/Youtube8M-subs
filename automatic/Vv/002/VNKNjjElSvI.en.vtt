00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:09.990
 yes from grafenstein good day I have 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:15.240
 the question i was i was recently at 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.619
 you in the cash register and I would have now 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.090
 a question in the back to 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.539
 I am under insurance 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.400
 I had a soup given and 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.470
 then the soup ladle is back in the 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.269
 Soup bowl in the pot so to speak 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.550
 dessau stylus fallen into it 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.869
 It is then a droplet on mine 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.280
 So a droplet of soup on my 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.390
 Armani Sako sprayed 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:46.770
 It would be the question how we do that best 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:48.750
 so the municipalities could handle the 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.230
 Cleaning would be costly 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.230
 been 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:01:09.590
 I probably have not eaten 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.590
 not not dealt 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.100
 these were georgi amano sakko 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:29.729
 but we can really do it again 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:36.030
 wanted to inquire in the morning with there 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:37.560
 use a lot of data on Monday 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.360
 when it now only Germany gabbana 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.280
 I will have said oh come but 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:47.990
 that was nothing for it 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.990
 ok anyway 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.280
 yes, what am I doing people that 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.410
 was just a small brenk 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.790
 in between, nothing special we are 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.890
 just did not come my size 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.670
 recording sessions and there will be 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.430
 come back more 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.490
 otherwise a or b with rum that works 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.630
 any case further and jack explains too 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.880
 that the example is still waiting 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.110
 So there is a lot of stuff and that is 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.460
 Also good as there are lots of new ones 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.390
 Subscribers welcome to the 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.740
