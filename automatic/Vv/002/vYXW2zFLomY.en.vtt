very good-looking tag at that says

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.370 
very good-looking tag at that says
this<00:06:22.060> is<00:06:22.180> what<00:06:22.360> it's<00:06:22.509> made<00:06:22.660> out<00:06:22.720> of<00:06:22.960> basically

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:23.380 
this is what it's made out of basically

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.700 
this is what it's made out of basically
the<00:06:23.500> percentages<00:06:25.199> I'm<00:06:26.199> not<00:06:26.350> going<00:06:26.500> to<00:06:26.560> be<00:06:26.650> able

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710 
the percentages I'm not going to be able

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:32.749 
the percentages I'm not going to be able
to<00:06:26.830> focus<00:06:27.310> on<00:06:27.490> it<00:06:30.120> yeah

00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:32.759 
to focus on it yeah

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:35.999 
to focus on it yeah
so<00:06:33.759> it's<00:06:33.910> adjustable<00:06:34.389> I<00:06:34.960> believe<00:06:35.560> this<00:06:35.710> is<00:06:35.770> the

00:06:35.999 --> 00:06:36.009 
so it's adjustable I believe this is the

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:40.320 
so it's adjustable I believe this is the
sizing<00:06:36.370> medium<00:06:37.770> I<00:06:38.770> think<00:06:39.759> there's<00:06:39.970> a<00:06:40.120> size

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.330 
sizing medium I think there's a size

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.330 
sizing medium I think there's a size
large<00:06:40.690> medium<00:06:41.229> I<00:06:41.500> don't<00:06:41.919> think<00:06:42.070> there's<00:06:42.250> a

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:42.340 
large medium I don't think there's a

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.770 
large medium I don't think there's a
small<00:06:42.490> I<00:06:43.620> have<00:06:44.620> a<00:06:44.680> pretty<00:06:44.919> small<00:06:45.190> head<00:06:45.400> and<00:06:45.780> the

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:46.780 
small I have a pretty small head and the

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:52.590 
small I have a pretty small head and the
medium<00:06:47.080> fits<00:06:47.289> me<00:06:47.470> well<00:06:49.320> so<00:06:50.320> I<00:06:51.120> mean<00:06:52.120> most<00:06:52.360> hats

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:52.600 
medium fits me well so I mean most hats

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.219 
medium fits me well so I mean most hats
don't<00:06:52.840> fit<00:06:53.139> me<00:06:53.259> well<00:06:53.410> but<00:06:53.949> this<00:06:54.100> one<00:06:54.280> does<00:06:54.520> and

00:06:55.219 --> 00:06:55.229 
don't fit me well but this one does and

00:06:55.229 --> 00:07:01.980 
don't fit me well but this one does and
the<00:06:56.229> back<00:06:57.030> adjustable<00:06:58.030> strap<00:06:58.810> helps<00:07:00.870> so<00:07:01.870> if

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:01.990 
the back adjustable strap helps so if

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:03.029 
the back adjustable strap helps so if
you<00:07:02.080> guys<00:07:02.169> have<00:07:02.350> a<00:07:02.410> big<00:07:02.560> head<00:07:02.770> you<00:07:02.949> should

you guys have a big head you should

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:06.500 
you guys have a big head you should
probably<00:07:03.250> go<00:07:03.430> for<00:07:03.580> a<00:07:03.669> large<00:07:04.830> feel<00:07:05.830> like<00:07:05.979> me

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:06.510
