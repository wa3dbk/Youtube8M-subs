00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.280 

we're<00:01:35.150> going<00:01:35.330> to<00:01:35.450> use<00:01:35.570> our<00:01:35.870> attack<00:01:36.260> spell<00:01:38.290> now

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
we're going to use our attack spell now

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:40.840 
we're going to use our attack spell now
we're<00:01:39.500> going<00:01:39.620> to<00:01:39.680> be<00:01:39.770> upgrading<00:01:40.310> these<00:01:40.430> dark

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
we're going to be upgrading these dark

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.100 
we're going to be upgrading these dark
towers<00:01:41.260> into<00:01:42.260> the<00:01:42.620> pink<00:01:42.980> ones<00:01:43.220> here<00:01:44.110> that's

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
towers into the pink ones here that's

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.840 
towers into the pink ones here that's
because<00:01:45.440> the<00:01:45.770> skeletons<00:01:46.340> that<00:01:46.490> will<00:01:46.730> be

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
because the skeletons that will be

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.300 
because the skeletons that will be
appearing<00:01:47.180> in<00:01:47.570> later<00:01:47.840> waves<00:01:48.200> are<00:01:48.530> immune<00:01:49.040> to

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
appearing in later waves are immune to

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.700 
appearing in later waves are immune to
the<00:01:49.670> green<00:01:50.060> dark<00:01:50.390> towers<00:01:50.780> they<00:01:51.230> take<00:01:51.500> no

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
the green dark towers they take no

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.500 
the green dark towers they take no
damage<00:01:51.980> from<00:01:52.310> them<00:01:52.550> so<00:01:52.760> we<00:01:52.880> need<00:01:53.000> the<00:01:53.180> pink

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
damage from them so we need the pink

00:01:53.510 --> 00:02:05.700 
damage from them so we need the pink
towers<00:01:55.900> now<00:01:56.900> you<00:01:57.230> need<00:01:57.380> to<00:01:57.500> be<00:01:57.620> targeting<00:01:58.100> them

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.350 

you<00:02:06.710> may<00:02:07.040> need<00:02:07.340> to<00:02:07.580> use<00:02:07.610> your<00:02:07.820> ice<00:02:08.270> spell<00:02:08.630> here

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
you may need to use your ice spell here

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:21.150 
you may need to use your ice spell here
if<00:02:11.360> you're<00:02:11.990> lucky<00:02:12.230> you<00:02:12.560> won't<00:02:12.709> need<00:02:12.920> to<00:02:13.070> use<00:02:13.100> it

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.940 

so<00:02:22.160> just<00:02:22.370> keep<00:02:22.610> targeting<00:02:22.850> them<00:02:23.240> individually

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.410 

now<00:02:27.950> we<00:02:28.070> upgrade<00:02:28.370> this<00:02:28.580> into<00:02:28.910> the<00:02:29.090> sniper

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
now we upgrade this into the sniper

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.600 
now we upgrade this into the sniper
tower<00:02:29.740> now<00:02:30.740> we're<00:02:30.920> going<00:02:31.040> to<00:02:31.130> be<00:02:31.190> getting<00:02:31.370> the

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.960 
tower now we're going to be getting the
skeleton<00:02:32.270> wave

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.220 

we're<00:02:38.420> going<00:02:38.540> to<00:02:38.600> settle<00:02:38.840> this<00:02:38.870> we're<00:02:39.110> gonna

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.009 

now<00:02:49.670> we're<00:02:49.819> gonna<00:02:49.909> be<00:02:50.090> using<00:02:50.390> our<00:02:50.510> I<00:02:50.659> spell

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019
