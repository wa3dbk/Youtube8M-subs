 the task is to erect the following 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:19.080
 plasterboard partition with two 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:22.080

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.880
 plaster partition wall for this 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.320
 use a special saw with 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.320
 carbide teeth 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.910

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.309
 glued on all rack and 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.180
 guide profiles adjacent to 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.710
 walls and ceilings in order to avoid 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.739
 cracks at the junction of sheets 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.739
 drywall 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:58.579
 using a laser level we produce 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.579
 marking the position of future partitions 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.490
 to give the design more

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.070
 insert the timber section 45 45 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.910
 millimeters which to avoid 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.000
 deformations 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:24.510

 on the lower end of the door the task is to be 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:04.250
 following erect a partition from 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.250

 [music] 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:19.040
 we cut a plaster partition for 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.480
 of this we use a special saw with 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.480
 carbide teeth 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.080
 dm black ribbon 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.480
 glued on all rack and 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.650
 guide profiles adjacent to 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.920
 walls and ceiling 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.910
 in order to avoid cracks in places 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.910
 drywall sheet joint 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.920
 to give the design more

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:12.610
 rack profile insert timber section 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.080
 45 to 45 millimeters which 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.170
 avoidance of deformation 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.650
 cut into pieces about 50
