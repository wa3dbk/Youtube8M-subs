00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.060
 Well, let's see a bit about 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.769
 what is the concept of land and mass 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.020
 just what we talked about in the 

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:12.600
 previous article let's explain what 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.860
 what is the concept of mass right now 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.800
 we are in what is the back 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.600
 of the vehicle in the trunk and we're going to 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.810
 check a circuit which with it is 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.400
 connected to mass like being here we're going to 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.520
 move the carpet a little to see the 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.770
 circuit this circuit belongs to what 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.950
 which is the taillights or top lights 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:35.070
 of the vehicle and how can you see 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.760
 and it is connected to ground by 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.879
 middle of this cable 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.519
 remember that massa is always the 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.829
 driver back to the side 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:47.559
 negative battery and that driver 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.479
 of return is the chassis of the vehicle and 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.979
 as here as you can see this is 

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:54.640
 connected to the chassis by this means 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:56.170
 screw and this connection goes towards 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.799
 negative the battery by means of all the 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.780
 chassis then this is what it uses 

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:04.269
 the car to get ahead 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.700
 to the negative of the battery also here 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.670
 we'll see 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.289
 in this part of above here we have 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.250
 also another circuit that is connected 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:16.560
 to ground through this cable this 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.880
 circuit belongs to the stop light but 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.350
 It is the third stop light 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.350
 here we have alonso 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.409
 that would be extra 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.010
 and it's also connected to ground by 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.750
 middle of this this cable 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.600
 good and now I 'll explain what 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.150
 is the concept of earth with what is 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.300
 an electrical circuit here as we can 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.100
 see we have the battery part and 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.220
 we have what is the negative of the 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.890
 Earth battery would be in a circuit 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.560
 electric the lowest potential 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.410
 existing in the same as in this case 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.320
 would be the negative of the battery and it's what 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.300
 that we have here the correct way in the 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.960
 that you could use this term as 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:04.020
 land would only be this part what 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.190
 is the negative of the battery 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.530
 just likewise you will find in 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:13.170
 the different diagrams or even 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.810
 people who are also dedicated to what 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.629
 it is the automotive that comes this part and 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.400
 they also call it earth what is a 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:22.330
 circuit connected mass as we had 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.090
 viewed 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.830
 so you do not get confused it 's more common 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.960
 who can call this part of the earth 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.880
 call him more to everything that is with 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.100
 this goes chassis commonly also it 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.160
 called earth but you charge it and that 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.540
 right part or the right place that 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.700
 it should be called earth in what is the 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.099
 car is only him 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.980
 the negative of the battery all that is 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:50.000
 the chassis goes up to this part 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:52.459
 by means of the return driver that 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.440
 it's the same chassis that's why it's called 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.810
 chassis landed all this will get 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.940
 up to the circuit land that 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.099
 we saw back there that arrives until here 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.599
 forward through the chassis runs 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.580
 all the chassis everything is the part 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:06.730
 of tressis and reaches this part by 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.040
 do not see the cables 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.920
 here you can see another circuit which 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.700
 Are you connected 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.230
 also to by means of this screw 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.530
 remember that all circuits 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:22.080
 connected to ground go directly to 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.590
 land which is what the cost would be 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.400
 negative battery that would be this 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.319
 regardless of where 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.080
 find either back in the trunk or 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:34.440
 inside in the car or here ahead in what 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.870
 which is the hood the part of the engine all 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.600
 they are connected by means of the chassis 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.880
 that's why it's called a landed chassis 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.340
 are connected to earth by means of 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.900
 chassis this part of here as you 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:52.680
 commented what would be right to call it 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:54.799
 connection to ground however as 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.480
 equally said everyone 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:04:00.450
 commonly calls it that is updated 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.400
 or is connected to ground is this 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.730
 it is commonly called a connection to 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.250
 land for when you mention about 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.930
 of that term because you're going to know that what 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.140
 most likely it is a connection to 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.270
 dough 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.970
 it would be practically the difference between 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:19.040
 earth and mass remember that mass always 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.890
 is going to be the return driver towards 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.620
 negative side of the battery and ground going 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:26.570
 to be the lowest potential existing in 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.940
 this circuit that would be the pole 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.860
 negative battery would be all for 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.780
 today we see the next video and 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.970
 remember to visit mechanical book puntocom 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.330
 I'm an angel stack and see you in the 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.330
 next
