00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 A trip to another city had to 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.100
 so far the car or the railway 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.200
 serve 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.599
 A ride on the bus was on the 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.179
 limited area around the place of residence 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.460
 that has changed now for some 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.949
 months drive you to her 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.770
 desired goal and that goes also from 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.660
 hannover from vincent rheinkamp reports 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.400
 They start in Hanover 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.770
 different long-distance buses from all over 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.500
 Germany including the two providers 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.690
 vlexplus and my remote bus you have at 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.010
 a test of the automobile club mobile in 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.500
 germany the first two places 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.080
 occupied since november there is only 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.210
 still the adac postbus the motto of the 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.900
 new competitor quality has its 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.870
 price 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.940
 we set up with the adac postbus 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.140
 comfort and safety that means the 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.800
 Buses have a very high 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.489
 Quality standard drivers are special 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.440
 Educated for being a good one 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.110
 feel with this concept the 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.850
 competition is skeptical she hopes that 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.130
 the partisan post group in 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.110
 merger with the adac remaining 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.420
 it is feared that the financial strength 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.310
 adac postbus cooperations the 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.860
 television by excesses from the 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.700
 Subsidiary monopoly indirectly subsidized 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.530
 this has not happened yet 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.210
 confirmed by that remain the 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.830
 previous provider left 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.180
 I do not want to have that as a competition 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.700
 I see the more than 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.440
 Competitors and we welcome a new one 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.600
 Competitors in the market and are 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.560
 curious how the general market itself 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.470
 is further developed 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.149
 unlike the adac postbus, flix provide 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.039
 until and my Fernbus already numerous 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.020
 connections to and from hanover 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:34.450
 with vlexplus reach from hanover 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.240
 Over 20 destinations throughout Germany 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.550
 There are even 37 places on a long-distance bus 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.709
 Fernbusmarkt book man several times with the 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.080
 Fernbus instead of the railway the largest 

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:46.330
 argument for the Fernbus is the 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.420
 much cheaper price my lottery 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.910
 up to 70 percent cheaper than the train 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.679
 In addition, we offer many goals 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.479
 as a direct connection to that is without 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:58.000
 changed the estimate above all older 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.190
 passengers free wifi one 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.860
 seat guarantee close contact to 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.450
 riders the busses offer some who 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.920
 But I want to go by bus 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.660
 also plan more time 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.970
 The buses are not as fast as one 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.200
 pc and delays who are jams 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.450
 nothing unusual 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.940
 maybe even strong ten 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.680
 minutes late to here if the 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.239
 Dust is call we need to flex 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.280
 Immediately sign up for anything over 15 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.680
 minutes is but thank God is have 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.330
 we also in the buses gps tracking like that 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.950
 that you can see exactly from vlexplus 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.360
 can just where the boss is or us 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.370
 are also already called by flix 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.020
 People father and that already forms itself 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.190
 a big star prefers to go over 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.230
 roads so you do not have that much time 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.580
 have ours and if possible ours 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.950
 schedule 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.740
 There are more for the Fernbus 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.270
 Challenges from 2016 must the 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.700
 buses are handicapped accessible 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.950
 In many places there are no modern ones 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.050
 Bus stops in Hanover also became 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.280
 Therefore, recently with a new construction of the 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.280
 started zob
