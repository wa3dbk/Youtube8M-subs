00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.270 
over how Knox is defense great
anti-malware<00:02:28.540> service<00:02:29.540> obviously<00:02:30.200> we<00:02:31.040> call

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
anti-malware service obviously we call

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.170 
anti-malware service obviously we call
the<00:02:31.600> Samsung<00:02:32.600> yes<00:02:32.810> correct<00:02:33.680> about<00:02:33.980> that<00:02:34.220> but

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
the Samsung yes correct about that but

as you can see you can activate Knox
active<00:02:37.609> protection<00:02:38.030> we're<00:02:38.810> not<00:02:38.930> going<00:02:39.139> to<00:02:39.230> do

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
active protection we're not going to do

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.979 
active protection we're not going to do
that<00:02:39.530> we<00:02:39.680> do<00:02:40.190> that<00:02:40.370> because<00:02:40.549> it<00:02:41.090> takes<00:02:41.480> a<00:02:41.810> while

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
that we do that because it takes a while

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.319 
that we do that because it takes a while
but<00:02:42.829> right<00:02:43.040> now<00:02:43.190> the<00:02:43.250> good<00:02:43.790> thing<00:02:43.970> here<00:02:44.000> is

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
but right now the good thing here is

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:45.220 
but right now the good thing here is
that<00:02:44.359> right<00:02:44.750> now

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
that right now

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.860 
that right now
not<00:02:45.829> detecting<00:02:46.459> no<00:02:46.670> malware<00:02:46.970> and<00:02:47.389> all<00:02:47.540> threads

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
not detecting no malware and all threads

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.170 
not detecting no malware and all threads
so<00:02:48.530> at<00:02:49.250> least<00:02:49.400> that's<00:02:49.609> good

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
so at least that's good

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:57.720 
so at least that's good
here's<00:02:50.660> how<00:02:50.810> a<00:02:50.840> quick<00:02:51.109> scan<00:02:51.380> works

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.550 

because<00:02:58.239> you<00:02:58.330> can<00:02:58.510> see<00:02:58.750> it<00:02:59.020> takes<00:02:59.200> a<00:02:59.410> little

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
because you can see it takes a little

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.270 
because you can see it takes a little
bit<00:02:59.830> obviously

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.550 

and<00:03:04.610> scans<00:03:05.060> complete<00:03:05.450> it<00:03:05.600> and<00:03:05.810> again<00:03:06.140> we<00:03:06.380> have

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
and scans complete it and again we have

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.130 
and scans complete it and again we have
no<00:03:06.590> treads<00:03:07.190> detected<00:03:07.700> so<00:03:08.450> this<00:03:08.660> was<00:03:08.840> Marc

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
no treads detected so this was Marc

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.440 
no treads detected so this was Marc
