the dealer 15 dealer breaks
doesn't<00:01:55.969> this<00:01:56.030> card<00:01:56.240> look<00:01:56.390> better<00:01:56.539> here<00:01:56.780> and

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
doesn't this card look better here and

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.289 
doesn't this card look better here and
here<00:01:58.479> let's<00:01:59.479> look<00:01:59.689> at<00:01:59.780> another<00:01:59.990> situation<00:02:01.299> and

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
here let's look at another situation and

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.740 
here let's look at another situation and
this<00:02:02.450> one<00:02:02.659> the<00:02:02.750> player<00:02:02.959> has<00:02:03.229> an<00:02:03.409> ace

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
this one the player has an ace

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.669 
this one the player has an ace
as<00:02:05.750> you<00:02:05.840> recall<00:02:05.929> aces<00:02:06.590> can<00:02:06.709> be<00:02:06.860> either<00:02:07.009> 1<00:02:07.280> or<00:02:07.549> 11

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
as you recall aces can be either 1 or 11

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.779 
as you recall aces can be either 1 or 11
so<00:02:09.679> this<00:02:09.799> player<00:02:10.009> that<00:02:10.190> has<00:02:10.340> a<00:02:10.369> hand<00:02:10.670> that

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
so this player that has a hand that

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.479 
so this player that has a hand that
could<00:02:10.880> be<00:02:10.970> scored<00:02:11.209> is<00:02:11.299> 8<00:02:11.510> or<00:02:12.160> 18

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
could be scored is 8 or 18

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.789 
could be scored is 8 or 18
so<00:02:14.030> if<00:02:14.090> players<00:02:14.329> playing<00:02:14.599> 18<00:02:15.140> versus<00:02:15.620> this

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:15.799 
so if players playing 18 versus this

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:18.670 
so if players playing 18 versus this
dealers<00:02:16.250> 8<00:02:16.810> learning<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:17.870> basic<00:02:18.200> strategy

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
dealers 8 learning the basic strategy
