ripping your carseat
you're<00:02:35.970> not<00:02:36.209> and<00:02:36.600> it<00:02:37.080> will<00:02:37.260> take<00:02:37.470> a<00:02:37.500> little<00:02:37.739> bit

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
you're not and it will take a little bit

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.500 
you're not and it will take a little bit
of<00:02:37.950> force<00:02:38.250> for<00:02:38.610> some<00:02:38.850> of<00:02:39.030> them<00:02:39.150> some<00:02:39.390> of<00:02:39.420> them

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
of force for some of them some of them

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.960 
of force for some of them some of them
are<00:02:39.690> very<00:02:39.720> easy<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.319> get<00:02:40.620> out<00:02:40.739> but<00:02:41.400> you<00:02:41.459> want<00:02:41.819> to

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
are very easy to get out but you want to

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.900 
are very easy to get out but you want to
make<00:02:42.150> sure<00:02:42.180> you<00:02:42.950> put<00:02:43.950> it<00:02:44.040> in<00:02:44.220> that<00:02:44.400> hole<00:02:44.459> and

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
make sure you put it in that hole and

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.530 
make sure you put it in that hole and
take<00:02:45.299> it<00:02:45.480> out<00:02:45.630> and<00:02:45.959> so<00:02:46.950> that<00:02:47.220> is<00:02:47.549> how<00:02:47.940> you<00:02:48.269> would

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
take it out and so that is how you would

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:55.160 
take it out and so that is how you would
get<00:02:48.660> that<00:02:48.720> out<00:02:49.070> it's<00:02:50.070> still<00:02:50.459> attached<00:02:53.269> so<00:02:54.269> we

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
get that out it's still attached so we

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.470 
get that out it's still attached so we
are<00:02:55.440> going<00:02:55.769> to<00:02:56.480> turn<00:02:57.480> it<00:02:57.630> around<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:59.329> take<00:03:00.329> the

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
are going to turn it around to take the

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.140 
are going to turn it around to take the

rest of this Karstens off but for the

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.030 
rest of this Karstens off but for the
most<00:03:03.329> part<00:03:03.480> we<00:03:03.959> are<00:03:03.989> almost<00:03:04.320> done<00:03:06.739> okay

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
most part we are almost done okay

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.849 
most part we are almost done okay
I<00:03:08.220> have<00:03:08.579> flipped<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.120> car<00:03:09.420> seat<00:03:09.720> around<00:03:10.019> and<00:03:10.380> I

just want to show you there's going to

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.009 
just want to show you there's going to
be<00:03:13.019> similar<00:03:13.650> like<00:03:13.829> a<00:03:14.100> clip<00:03:14.459> like<00:03:14.700> this<00:03:14.760> if<00:03:15.390> it

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
be similar like a clip like this if it

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.670 
be similar like a clip like this if it
might<00:03:16.380> be<00:03:16.560> metal<00:03:16.920> or<00:03:17.040> plastic<00:03:17.450> it<00:03:18.450> is<00:03:18.680> holding

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
might be metal or plastic it is holding

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.150 
might be metal or plastic it is holding
these<00:03:20.220> two<00:03:20.519> straps<00:03:21.120> that<00:03:21.660> will<00:03:21.870> go<00:03:22.049> down<00:03:22.350> there

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
these two straps that will go down there

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.509 
these two straps that will go down there
holding<00:03:23.579> them<00:03:23.790> and<00:03:24.350> it's<00:03:25.350> almost<00:03:25.890> it<00:03:26.280> is

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
holding them and it's almost it is

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.539 
holding them and it's almost it is
actually<00:03:27.269> is<00:03:27.420> like<00:03:27.660> this<00:03:27.959> is<00:03:28.410> like<00:03:28.799> this<00:03:29.310> but

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
actually is like this is like this but

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.400 
actually is like this is like this but
you<00:03:29.700> only<00:03:29.850> see<00:03:30.060> this<00:03:30.239> part<00:03:30.510> it<00:03:30.690> is<00:03:30.930> holding

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
you only see this part it is holding

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.200 
you only see this part it is holding
this<00:03:32.310> in<00:03:32.609> to<00:03:33.480> this

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.210 
this in to this

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.740 
this in to this
and<00:03:34.390> then<00:03:34.600> back<00:03:34.870> in<00:03:35.430> to<00:03:36.430> the<00:03:36.550> other<00:03:36.790> end<00:03:37.120> so

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
and then back in to the other end so

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:45.060 
and then back in to the other end so
it's<00:03:37.960> coding<00:03:38.710> it<00:03:40.350> kind<00:03:41.350> of<00:03:42.090> like<00:03:43.090> this<00:03:43.920> so<00:03:44.920> what

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070
