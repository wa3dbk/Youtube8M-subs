motorsport is it's very difficult to get
into<00:02:13.340> this<00:02:13.970> could<00:02:14.209> not<00:02:14.390> be<00:02:14.540> simpler<00:02:14.900> but

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
into this could not be simpler but

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.020 
into this could not be simpler but
basically<00:02:15.830> fill<00:02:16.010> a<00:02:16.040> form<00:02:16.250> and<00:02:16.550> get<00:02:16.760> in<00:02:16.849> touch

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
basically fill a form and get in touch

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.990 
basically fill a form and get in touch
with<00:02:17.090> us<00:02:17.269> you<00:02:18.170> pay<00:02:18.319> an<00:02:18.440> initial<00:02:18.620> entry<00:02:19.069> fee<00:02:19.280> and

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
if there's enough talent there you'll be

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.020 
if there's enough talent there you'll be
in<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.769> final<00:02:22.129> it's<00:02:22.400> as<00:02:22.519> simple<00:02:22.640> as<00:02:22.879> that<00:02:22.910> and

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
in the final it's as simple as that and

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:38.740 
in the final it's as simple as that and
you<00:02:23.180> could<00:02:23.300> win<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:23.540> drive
