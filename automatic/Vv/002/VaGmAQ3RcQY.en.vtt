all know fish cooks incredibly fast it's
only<00:01:49.689> going<00:01:49.869> to<00:01:49.929> need<00:01:50.020> a<00:01:50.079> couple<00:01:50.439> minutes<00:01:50.740> on

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
each side so I suggest getting

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.969

everything<00:01:52.569> else<00:01:52.750> prepped<00:01:53.170> but<00:01:53.619> then<00:01:53.740> you<00:01:53.829> can

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
everything else prepped but then you can

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.289 
everything else prepped but then you can
pretty<00:01:54.130> much<00:01:54.219> toss<00:01:54.579> your<00:01:54.819> little<00:01:55.000> salsa

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
pretty much toss your little salsa

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.010 
pretty much toss your little salsa
together<00:01:55.479> as<00:01:55.929> the<00:01:56.799> fish<00:01:57.009> cooks<00:01:57.399> so<00:01:58.030> a<00:01:58.270> little

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
together as the fish cooks so a little

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.199 
together as the fish cooks so a little
