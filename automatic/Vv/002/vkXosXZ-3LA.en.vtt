00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 and that for the good guy because 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:05.400
 we are in a new online gta build 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.890
 and it's a pretty easy to do 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.510
 pretty quick to do too and 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.190
 pretty funny to do it with 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.840
 your friends since it is a clichÃ© 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.269
 well then to go out to fly 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.690
 no but to vote too high to jump 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.340
 very high and good now in a row 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.470
 Show the location as you can see here 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.060
 the location of the place where we have 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.769
 to go as you see is here on top of the 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.380
 city pretty easy to recognize a 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.500
 site and good is that simple I leave 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.600
 here in the video the images of the map and 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.210
 well as you see, we will not go up 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.350
 stairs that are on the side of a 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.860
 building by one of them there are several 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.590
 stairs 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.750
 well once here we will have to 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.240
 jump here to this little and good 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.190
 here metro and this now you are going to see how 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.640
 I stumble I'm stuck here and 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:54.220
 I can not go out and now he throws me inside 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.510
 of the building this can not be seen from 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.400
 another way you can simply enter 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.600
 well and quiet big mistakes 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.910
 commit suicide if a mean that is 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.220
 you can simply get out living the 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.440
 stairs these are here as you see 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.790
 I go towards the stairs and I climb 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.560
 automatically goes through the wall 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.550
 because I'm like this going through walls 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.020
 pressure and good here what is in 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.000
 good reality as you see here well then 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.860
 I stand and as a weapon we have to have 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.119
 the fist put and hit the wall this 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.130
 I'm hitting him as you are 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.840
 seeing like this I go up a little bit up 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.660
 sometimes it jumps much sometimes jumps is 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.130
 little bit and that sometimes it 's random 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.200
 as you see here and now I hit a 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.850
 host against the ground minus the 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.070
 head but good I'm fine the 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.710
 character is immortal almost 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.229
 and again I was stuck here and I 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.420
 again throw in there sometimes 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.910
 throw in here and sometimes it's not like that 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.030
 times that luck more than anything according to how 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.830
 you fall even kids reduce this is 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.210
 leave like this to do it with your 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.210
 Risks have to be pretty fun 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.920
 here everyone falls and you do not have 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.960
 that being a little funny 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.880
 to this city until the next video 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.880
 now it 's reported goodbye
