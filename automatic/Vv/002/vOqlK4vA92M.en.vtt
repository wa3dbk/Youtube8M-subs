00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.540
 indiscriminately wow blog is presented to you 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.540
 from belgium point eu 

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:15.490
 looking for aid i want you first 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.830
 a short introduction to the 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.810
 give basic needs of wow players 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.110
 which is important for understanding the following 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.720
 are 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:29.349
 secondly, please be many 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.970
 Of these, there have always been the most fx 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.850
 in raid content and that was 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.740
 demanding and it followed 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.140
 dilemma because who like me now 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:40.450
 more comments under youtube videos 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.330
 the forums read that quickly becomes clear 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.980
 that claim in any form not 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.570
 necessarily with all passionate ones 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.970
 Wow players are high on the top 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.700
 Shopping list is quite the opposite 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.620
 to the already mentioned epics stupidly 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.240
 the nasty developers of 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.220
 Blizzard, however, a heinous 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.470
 and inhumane game designer 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.780
 thought that obtaining epics 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:05.590
 should prevent 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:10.049
 the so-called raiders had to move in 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:14.140
 learn groups of tactics together 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:16.780
 communicate hours in instances 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.390
 could spend and even under 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.820
 many guantanamo conditions 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.060
 bosses even in the second or even third 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.460
 try not to lay 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.249
 in turn, the community angry about 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.310
 after all, epics were the last 

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:36.490
 integral part of the game and 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.710
 you pay for this game 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.990
 Insight from Blizzard followed late 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.090
 and rumored only due 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.569
 massive intervention by amnesty 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:49.389
 internationally the lfl was born 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:52.329
 you sign up via a button and 

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:54.399
 will then be in with 24 random players 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:55.649
 a lighter version of a current one 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:59.049
 thrown right 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:02.740
 in my head I tried that now 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:06.310
 probability to calculate that 25 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.649
 Random players do it in finite time 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.300
 even create a single one 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.709
 current red bite grow and came after 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.370
 repeated in-depth examination to the 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:20.310
 result closed 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.010
 And even if you can do it mathematically 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.340
 I did not think one was right 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.040
 that is to say that you are boss mechanics 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.000
 jahn's assumed player level adjust 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.239
 could 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.730
 to make you more figurative 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.209
 the lfr level as a football goal 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.000
 in front 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.519
 and now that makes so little bit 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.200
 You can screw the meadows with the ball 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.280
 So encounter mechanics so far 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.620
 not that much anymore 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.560
 he can go wrong second I have to 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.540
 different methods that not much anymore 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.510
 can go wrong 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:58.290
 short gamer arithmetic barlows first 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.510
 Law says if we have one way 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.870
 small probability of entering 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.760
 a negative event with a 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.470
 ability of all involved 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.340
 multiply that by infinity 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.549
 then seeks this event 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.940
 enter 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.739
 but later more in the lfa prevails 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.829
 first of all a very similar problem 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:22.799
 as in the mfg tool you need two 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:26.609
 tanks and six healers and before now 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.840
 some reta the nimsoft android 32 kg 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:31.019
 ps in german spelling 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:34.260
 goes to note that you also 17 dds 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:37.410
 I need god damn it 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.030
 that you also need 17 dds but in 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.280
 world of warcraft autumn usually 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.959
 as much lack of details as in 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.829
 American households lack 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.569
 firearms 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:49.049
 back to the topic just like in the elephant 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.980
 Tanks are still more than healers 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:52.620
 mangelware 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.889
 but there are many dds in their on bacon 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.900
 could think 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:59.310
 You can also report it as a tank and that 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.129
 you realize quite fast I have there 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:07.829
 this image in mind as the tank at 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:12.329
 Invited reacted quickly looked 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:16.169
 so this shield hit that loosely 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:21.440
 the bar there you need well 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:21.440
 Shield for now well 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.840
 what have beautiful thing that 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:35.909
 devastate bush no cola and bad 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.620
 Armor and me only after all 

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:39.409
 back to encounter mechanics times the 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.840
 not much can go wrong and 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:46.740
 Exhibit a1 the lfm tanks 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.870
 stone guard motion vault dangerous 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.389
 Semi-knowledge can best be applied to the 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.400
 tanks illustrate the times heard 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:56.220
 have that three kitties 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:59.300
 fueled up and somehow 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:02.789
 have to be killed and that too 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:05.460
 that's right, that would normally be the case 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:09.030
 it is counterproductive in the nfl 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:11.490
 because so in the 11th way this 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:14.599
 unnecessary tactics would have to work 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:18.300
 Both tanks know the strategy both 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:22.110
 and b both tanks have a rough idea 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:24.750
 when or and what they could 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:28.979
 Let's make it short I was in the lfa 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:34.319
 alone with a priest 95 times 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:36.870
 this boss every time when tanks this 

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:40.710
 tactics have been tried the raid 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:42.690
 petrified one of my favorite bosses 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.740
 are also the ghosts kings where I am 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.169
 always a bit back and forth 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:49.110
 Torn in the tank to ask if 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:50.120
 he knows the boss or prefers happy 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.889
 to found 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:55.860
 who does not know the first of the four 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:58.050
 Ghost Kings has an attack on the 13th 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.300
 makes millions of physical damage 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.279
 this we harm between all 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.669
 players split them in one 

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:07.909
 small area in front of him 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:11.099
 Now let's divide the 1.3 million 

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:14.039
 hurt by the amount of players the 

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:18.259
 Immediately before standing out if only 

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:20.580
 The tank will be good for him at the beginning 

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:23.370
 we multiply that value by the 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:28.589
 Physical damage reduction of the lsr 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:30.509
 tanks the result battle rest of the fans 

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:31.539
 Half it should be mentioned that it is not in fr 

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:34.160
 only the tanks 

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:35.870
 I have a small poem 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.789
 written around this potentially 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.460
 deadly mechanics of the encounters 

00:06:37.789 --> 00:06:42.949
 easier to remember 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:46.729
 the elegant then sports the balls at home 

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:49.699
 Dead in place and if one 

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:52.699
 the edge reaches the sun rises and 

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:54.410
 lightly shining then you are still in 

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:57.050
 the middle then move your 

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:59.810
 goddamn 8000 quite difficult 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:01.340
 means the suitcase packs its contents 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:04.490
 conclusion but still briefly to one 

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:06.680
 brazen law as a wow player and 

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:08.050
 you probably have it like me on the 

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.880
 learned hard tour 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:12.830
 you had that weird sign over 

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.949
 the head and did not know what it does 

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:17.630
 so you did not react oh yes 

00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:20.360
 That was the sign of a friendly fire 

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:21.650
 Effect that kills everyone and you are standing 

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.900
 stayed away instead of running away 

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:25.909
 and they painted you because of it 

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:29.720
 always the sign for a valve v 

00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:32.270
 effect is and everyone yvio knows that except 

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:34.130
 you and it never happened here again 

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:35.750
 and there are only two things that 

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:38.300
 one you have to know yourself nothing else 

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:40.009
 over the encounter white stand in the fire 

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:43.039
 and if you have a sign over your head 

00:07:40.009 --> 00:07:47.360
 almost then run away from the wheel and indeed 

00:07:43.039 --> 00:07:49.759
 far and fast except when sounding for 

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:54.520
 star jack to the death if it does 

00:07:49.759 --> 00:07:54.520
 Now you can know big old ones
