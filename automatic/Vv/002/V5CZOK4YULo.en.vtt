00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:07.570
 11 04 in the cold but also that holds and not from him some tips too 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:08.060
 give 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.060
 the books come with their skills coming 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:16.800
 Hamburg apn 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.439
 Frick free in the coming winter 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.739
 but before the air "One should risk that from one again 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:24.689
 Check dealer for winter suitability 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.839
 the topic and today's episode is right approach 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:30.069
 and brake properly 

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:33.190
 but Merkel's décolleté will still fall away 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.190
 the MINT intact a kind 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.970
 and maybe soon in the Free State in the ticket hall of a flank not planned 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.760
 Ulm 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.469
 so that something like this did not happen to us we gave some hints 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.969
 not even the mistakes when approaching 

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:22.719
 Male the sample has been put 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:25.719
 This causes the drive wheels to rotate 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:31.379
 it can still all but a few 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.759
 we always work straight 

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:35.579
 because of the violence 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:38.579
 then have a cheaper translation 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:42.719
 but we do not want to 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.019
 Child play they mean 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.019
 okay then let's try driving on the mountain 

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:54.729
 our tip could be the gas now 

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:01.279
 and another child 

00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:04.919
 if we do not come right away they'll roll the cart back PC 

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:07.919
 get back just below the drive wheels 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.769
 next topic brakes also in winter goes first 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.769
 so hard on the brakes b 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.959
 But how do you react when you are fully on the brakes? 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.959
 and notice we do not make it to a halt before the obstacle 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:23.629
 come 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:26.710
 he is a very important reason that is from Koblenz 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:27.829
 and second 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:31.339
 Away from the brake because a blocking bike can not sleep 

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:34.469
 Leaders survive 

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:37.429
 only a rolling council is capable of doing so 

00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:41.969
 if they were enough, they would first have to solve three evenings from Brooklyn Brake 

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:44.969
 Father Gundelfinger did not turn around and brake again 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.749
 And please do not forget about Brawn in time for Delhi shortly 

00:03:49.749 --> 00:03:54.680
 Sadly enough, many motorists came into practice to show up completely 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.809
 banned and defined 

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:58.549
 Computing in this stressful situation 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:00.280
 to get over Stephen Warnock 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.280
 Meanwhile, the chances to avoid case remained 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:09.049
 Having a vehicle with it can brake and steer at the same time 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:12.650
 an advantage when it comes to using a fallback opportunity 

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:16.899
 in the book again in the situation aligned 

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:22.219
 Thanks to the braking point, the veins in front of them deserve sufficient hum 

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:25.219
 Obstacle over to taxes 

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:31.650
 served Emsdetten are quite parallels when comparing skiing and 

00:04:31.649 --> 00:04:34.949
 autographs 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:38.569
 When skiing, just have to drive a sample to run the edges 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:44.550
 its author must transfer the tire pages executives 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.510
 while speed and the clear-cutting to complain
