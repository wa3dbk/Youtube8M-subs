okay<00:00:05.730> our<00:00:05.910> group<00:00:06.150> two<00:00:06.390> of<00:00:06.600> macromolecules<00:00:07.350> are

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
okay our group two of macromolecules are

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.520 
okay our group two of macromolecules are
lipids<00:00:07.980> and<00:00:08.130> fats<00:00:09.019> we're<00:00:10.019> just<00:00:10.230> going<00:00:10.349> to<00:00:10.410> do

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
lipids and fats we're just going to do

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.830 
lipids and fats we're just going to do
lipids<00:00:10.860> and<00:00:10.950> fats<00:00:11.010> for<00:00:11.370> this<00:00:11.490> lecture<00:00:11.880> as

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
lipids and fats for this lecture as

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.539 
lipids and fats for this lecture as
before<00:00:13.320> you<00:00:13.650> could<00:00:13.799> stop<00:00:14.040> this<00:00:14.160> at<00:00:14.340> any<00:00:14.370> time

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
before you could stop this at any time

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.480 
before you could stop this at any time
to<00:00:14.820> copy<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.179> notes<00:00:15.440> will<00:00:16.440> do<00:00:16.560> proteins<00:00:17.100> and

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
to copy the notes will do proteins and

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.429 
to copy the notes will do proteins and
nucleic<00:00:18.029> acids<00:00:18.539> at<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.779> end

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.220 

so<00:00:22.439> basically<00:00:23.430> fats<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.269> oils<00:00:24.750> are<00:00:24.930> rich

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
so basically fats and oils are rich

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.330 
so basically fats and oils are rich
energy<00:00:25.740> storage<00:00:26.160> molecules<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:27.090> as<00:00:27.869> we've

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
energy storage molecules and as we've

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.349 
energy storage molecules and as we've
discussed<00:00:29.340> when<00:00:29.670> we<00:00:29.699> did<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.000> how<00:00:30.119> matter

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
discussed when we did the how matter

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.920 
discussed when we did the how matter
behaves<00:00:30.510> lab<00:00:31.019> when<00:00:31.890> we're<00:00:32.040> using<00:00:32.219> oils<00:00:32.930> you

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
behaves lab when we're using oils you

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.170 
behaves lab when we're using oils you
saw<00:00:34.200> how<00:00:34.500> they<00:00:34.739> have<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:34.980> very<00:00:35.370> hydrophobic

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
saw how they have a very hydrophobic

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.040 
saw how they have a very hydrophobic
nature<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.660> them

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
nature to them

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.380 
nature to them
so<00:00:37.710> in<00:00:38.040> general<00:00:38.250> fats<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.820> oils<00:00:39.120> are

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
so in general fats and oils are

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.600 
so in general fats and oils are
hydrophobic<00:00:40.170> biomolecules<00:00:41.129> made<00:00:41.399> up<00:00:41.520> of

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
hydrophobic biomolecules made up of

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.819 
hydrophobic biomolecules made up of
these<00:00:41.760> hydrocarbon<00:00:42.450> chains<00:00:42.750> if<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.530> go<00:00:43.620> back

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
these hydrocarbon chains if you go back

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.490 
these hydrocarbon chains if you go back
to<00:00:44.010> our<00:00:44.160> basic<00:00:44.520> discussion<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.350> hydrocarbons

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
to our basic discussion of hydrocarbons

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.470 
to our basic discussion of hydrocarbons
we<00:00:47.100> know<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.610> bond<00:00:47.850> between<00:00:48.120> hydrogen

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
we know that the bond between hydrogen

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.319 
we know that the bond between hydrogen
and<00:00:48.899> carbon<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.530> nonpolar<00:00:50.250> covalent<00:00:50.520> bond

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
and carbon is a nonpolar covalent bond

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.060 
and carbon is a nonpolar covalent bond
the<00:00:51.989> electrons<00:00:52.379> are<00:00:52.469> shared<00:00:52.620> evenly

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
the electrons are shared evenly

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.520 
the electrons are shared evenly
therefore<00:00:53.699> those<00:00:53.850> molecules<00:00:54.480> would<00:00:54.629> be<00:00:54.750> very

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
therefore those molecules would be very

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.630 
therefore those molecules would be very
hydrophobic<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.660> insoluble<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.960> water

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
hydrophobic and insoluble and water

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.639 
hydrophobic and insoluble and water
fats<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.910> oils<00:01:00.270> in<00:01:00.539> general<00:01:01.050> provide<00:01:01.230> energy

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
fats and oils in general provide energy

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.860 
fats and oils in general provide energy
storage<00:01:02.280> protection<00:01:02.940> as<00:01:03.090> well<00:01:03.570> as<00:01:03.719> other

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
cell membrane over here is what

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.890 
cell membrane over here is what
cholesterol<00:05:59.980> would<00:06:00.130> look<00:06:00.370> like<00:06:00.580> and<00:06:00.900> down

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
cholesterol would look like and down

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.200 
cholesterol would look like and down
here<00:06:02.230> we<00:06:02.350> have<00:06:02.380> that<00:06:02.740> waxy<00:06:03.280> coating<00:06:03.460> found<00:06:04.030> on

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 
here we have that waxy coating found on

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.780 
here we have that waxy coating found on
the<00:06:04.570> berries<00:06:04.960> here<00:06:05.260> and<00:06:05.470> that<00:06:06.220> would<00:06:06.310> serve<00:06:06.550> as

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:06.790 
the berries here and that would serve as

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:08.730 
the berries here and that would serve as
a<00:06:06.820> water<00:06:07.540> repellent<00:06:07.750> so<00:06:08.260> there<00:06:08.410> you<00:06:08.470> can<00:06:08.620> see

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740 
a water repellent so there you can see

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.590 
a water repellent so there you can see
