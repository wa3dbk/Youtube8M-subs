text from the previous slide here are
two<00:00:23.789> bullets<00:00:23.970> this<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.630> default<00:00:24.810> line

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
two bullets this is the default line

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.890 
two bullets this is the default line

spacing option for bullets now if it

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.570 
spacing option for bullets now if it
weren't<00:00:28.230> for<00:00:28.349> these<00:00:28.590> two<00:00:28.800> bullets<00:00:29.160> right<00:00:29.310> here

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
weren't for these two bullets right here

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.730 
weren't for these two bullets right here
it<00:00:30.150> would<00:00:30.330> be<00:00:30.420> difficult<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:31.019> really<00:00:31.289> see<00:00:31.500> if

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
it would be difficult to really see if

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.430 
it would be difficult to really see if
this<00:00:32.219> is<00:00:32.430> one<00:00:32.700> two<00:00:32.880> three<00:00:32.910> four<00:00:33.210> lines<00:00:34.200> of<00:00:34.380> text

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
this is one two three four lines of text

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.610 
this is one two three four lines of text
or<00:00:34.890> two<00:00:35.399> lines<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.910> if<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.090> resize<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:37.140> right

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
or two lines and if I resize it right

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.590 
or two lines and if I resize it right
does<00:00:37.860> this<00:00:37.950> look<00:00:38.160> like<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.700> six<00:00:39.090> lines<00:00:39.360> of

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
does this look like it is six lines of

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.319 
does this look like it is six lines of
text<00:00:40.140> or<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.950> individual<00:00:41.640> bullets<00:00:41.910> it's<00:00:42.030> very

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
text or to individual bullets it's very

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.080 
text or to individual bullets it's very
difficult<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:43.260> discern<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:44.250> with<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.910> line

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
difficult to discern that with the line

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.270 
difficult to discern that with the line
spacing<00:00:45.390> as<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.899> really<00:00:46.530> how<00:00:46.739> this<00:00:46.950> text

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
spacing as it is really how this text

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.279 
spacing as it is really how this text
should<00:00:47.730> be<00:00:47.879> grouped<00:00:48.300> but<00:00:48.840> if<00:00:48.930> we<00:00:49.020> look<00:00:49.200> at

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
should be grouped but if we look at

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.799 
should be grouped but if we look at
something<00:00:49.590> like<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:50.300> and<00:00:51.300> here's<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.629> same

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
something like this and here's the same

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.660 
something like this and here's the same
text<00:00:52.199> just<00:00:52.379> spaced<00:00:52.649> differently<00:00:52.829> what<00:00:53.640> a

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
text just spaced differently what a

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.490 
text just spaced differently what a
difference<00:00:54.120> right<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.539> see<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.960> line

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
difference right you see that the line

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.470 
difference right you see that the line
spacing<00:00:55.800> within<00:00:56.160> each<00:00:56.399> bullet<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.910> actually<00:00:57.449> a

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
spacing within each bullet is actually a

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.000 
spacing within each bullet is actually a
little<00:00:57.690> tighter<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.289> then<00:00:58.710> there's<00:00:58.859> some

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
little tighter and then there's some

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.360 
little tighter and then there's some
significant<00:00:59.550> spacing<00:01:00.059> between<00:01:00.930> each<00:01:01.500> bullet

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
significant spacing between each bullet

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.369 
significant spacing between each bullet
creates<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.390> grouping<00:01:03.870> effect<00:01:04.199> that

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
creates that grouping effect that

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.020 
creates that grouping effect that
chunking<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.860> really<00:01:05.129> just<00:01:05.339> what<00:01:05.580> bullets<00:01:05.939> are

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
chunking is really just what bullets are

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.609 
chunking is really just what bullets are
supposed<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.360> be<00:01:06.510> for<00:01:06.750> right<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.350> help

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
supposed to be for right to help

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.620 
supposed to be for right to help
readability<00:01:08.340> but<00:01:08.970> when<00:01:09.090> you're<00:01:09.210> looking<00:01:09.510> at

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
readability but when you're looking at

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.179 
readability but when you're looking at
something<00:01:09.840> like<00:01:10.080> this<00:01:10.409> it's<00:01:10.979> almost

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
something like this it's almost

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.510 
something like this it's almost
impossible<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:12.119> know<00:01:12.299> if<00:01:12.479> this<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.310> again<00:01:14.310> two

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
impossible to know if this is again two

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.460 
impossible to know if this is again two
bullets<00:01:14.850> or<00:01:14.970> multiple<00:01:15.540> bullets<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.320> want

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
bullets or multiple bullets and I want

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.570 
bullets or multiple bullets and I want
to<00:01:16.530> show<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.680> how<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.830> make<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:17.130> change<00:01:17.340> it's

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
to show you how to make that change it's

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.160 
to show you how to make that change it's
really<00:01:17.880> simple<00:01:18.180> but<00:01:18.420> it's<00:01:18.570> got<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.990> be<00:01:19.049> one<00:01:19.140> of

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
really simple but it's got to be one of

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.950 
really simple but it's got to be one of
the<00:01:19.290> most<00:01:19.409> overlooked<00:01:20.009> areas<00:01:20.460> in<00:01:20.960> PowerPoint

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
the most overlooked areas in PowerPoint

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.260 
the most overlooked areas in PowerPoint
and<00:01:22.140> elearning<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:22.860> just<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.189> lot<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.580> visual

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
and elearning and just a lot of visual

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.450 
and elearning and just a lot of visual
communication<00:01:24.650> so<00:01:25.650> in<00:01:25.770> PowerPoint<00:01:26.280> it's

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
communication so in PowerPoint it's

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.700 
communication so in PowerPoint it's
actually<00:01:26.759> just<00:01:27.150> as<00:01:27.299> simple<00:01:27.659> we'll<00:01:28.439> work<00:01:28.560> with

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
actually just as simple we'll work with

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.319 
actually just as simple we'll work with
the<00:01:28.829> same<00:01:28.979> example<00:01:29.340> we<00:01:29.579> worked<00:01:29.790> with<00:01:29.970> before

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
the same example we worked with before

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.270 
the same example we worked with before
right<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:30.840> this<00:01:30.960> was<00:01:31.140> our<00:01:31.290> content<00:01:31.860> slide<00:01:32.100> or

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
right so this was our content slide or

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.950 
right so this was our content slide or
content<00:01:32.640> placeholder<00:01:33.090> with<00:01:33.240> just<00:01:33.420> body<00:01:33.659> text

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
content placeholder with just body text

the previous lesson select text and I'm

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.580 
the previous lesson select text and I'm
going<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:47.909> drag<00:01:48.060> out<00:01:48.299> another<00:01:48.899> text

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
going to drag out another text

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.740 
going to drag out another text
placeholder<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:50.759> here's<00:01:51.000> our<00:01:51.090> default<00:01:51.450> text

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
placeholder so here's our default text

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.149 
placeholder so here's our default text
I'm<00:01:51.840> just<00:01:51.869> gonna<00:01:52.020> select<00:01:52.290> all<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.740> this<00:01:52.890> and

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
I'm just gonna select all of this and

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.160 
I'm just gonna select all of this and
I'll<00:01:53.220> call<00:01:53.399> this<00:01:55.399> an<00:01:56.399> ordered<00:01:57.060> list<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.600> for

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
I'll call this an ordered list and for

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.670 
I'll call this an ordered list and for
the<00:01:58.259> sake<00:01:58.439> of<00:01:58.469> this<00:01:58.680> example<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.369> will<00:02:00.530> type<00:02:01.530> a

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
the sake of this example I will type a

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.210 
the sake of this example I will type a
couple<00:02:01.950> lists<00:02:02.250> out

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.800 

so<00:02:08.220> we<00:02:08.310> can<00:02:08.460> see<00:02:08.610> what<00:02:08.730> we're<00:02:08.850> doing<00:02:08.880> alright

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
so we can see what we're doing alright

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.360 
so we can see what we're doing alright
so<00:02:09.930> this<00:02:10.020> is<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.230> default<00:02:10.560> spacing<00:02:10.740> exactly

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
so this is the default spacing exactly

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.070 
so this is the default spacing exactly
the<00:02:11.460> same<00:02:11.640> thing<00:02:11.820> we<00:02:11.940> just<00:02:12.150> looked<00:02:12.390> at<00:02:12.510> to

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
the same thing we just looked at to

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.420 
the same thing we just looked at to
select<00:02:13.380> all<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.620> text<00:02:13.650> or<00:02:14.100> I<00:02:14.130> could<00:02:14.340> select

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
select all the text or I could select

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.670 
select all the text or I could select
the<00:02:14.640> text<00:02:14.910> box<00:02:15.060> I<00:02:15.390> want<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:15.780> come<00:02:15.900> up<00:02:15.930> here<00:02:16.320> to

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
the text box I want to come up here to

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.250 
the text box I want to come up here to
home<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:17.460> then<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.030> line<00:02:18.300> spacing<00:02:18.630> options

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
home and then the line spacing options

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.020 
home and then the line spacing options
right<00:02:19.440> here<00:02:19.470> so<00:02:19.800> my<00:02:19.920> default<00:02:20.130> is<00:02:20.460> just<00:02:20.490> set<00:02:20.880> to

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
right here so my default is just set to

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.210 
right here so my default is just set to
one<00:02:21.210> well<00:02:21.450> moving<00:02:21.600> it<00:02:21.750> to<00:02:21.840> 1.5<00:02:22.440> isn't<00:02:22.830> any<00:02:23.010> help

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
one well moving it to 1.5 isn't any help

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.190 
one well moving it to 1.5 isn't any help
it<00:02:23.370> actually<00:02:23.610> makes<00:02:23.760> it<00:02:23.880> worse<00:02:23.910> 2.0<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:24.840> so<00:02:25.020> on

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
it actually makes it worse 2.0 and so on

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.830 
it actually makes it worse 2.0 and so on
line<00:02:26.010> spacing<00:02:26.370> options<00:02:26.970> this<00:02:27.450> is<00:02:27.600> what<00:02:27.750> we

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
line spacing options this is what we

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.960 
line spacing options this is what we
want<00:02:28.080> so<00:02:28.740> the<00:02:28.920> couple<00:02:29.190> things<00:02:29.400> couple<00:02:29.610> changes

look<00:03:26.970> how<00:03:27.090> much<00:03:27.239> tighter<00:03:27.570> these<00:03:27.840> are<00:03:28.110> and<00:03:28.470> if<00:03:29.130> I

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
look how much tighter these are and if I

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.610 
look how much tighter these are and if I
highlight<00:03:29.580> this<00:03:29.730> you<00:03:29.880> can<00:03:30.030> see<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:31.260> the

highlight this you can see the the the

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.770 
highlight this you can see the the the

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
twelve point spacing before up here

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.240 
twelve point spacing before up here
right<00:03:33.989> it's<00:03:34.230> still<00:03:34.410> selected<00:03:34.650> there's<00:03:35.100> that

right it's still selected there's that

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.100 
right it's still selected there's that
extra<00:03:35.520> space<00:03:35.700> that<00:03:35.940> was<00:03:36.060> created<00:03:36.360> by<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:36.510> the

extra space that was created by the the
spacing<00:03:37.500> options<00:03:37.890> but<00:03:38.340> what<00:03:38.459> a<00:03:38.489> difference<00:03:38.910> it

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
spacing options but what a difference it

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.580 
spacing options but what a difference it
makes<00:03:39.239> significant<00:03:39.959> difference<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:40.290> bullets

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
makes significant difference the bullets

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.740 
makes significant difference the bullets
a<00:03:40.650> little<00:03:40.830> bit<00:03:40.950> closer<00:03:41.190> over<00:03:41.700> to<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.330> actual

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
a little bit closer over to the actual

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.570 
a little bit closer over to the actual
text<00:03:43.080> we<00:03:43.470> have<00:03:43.620> a<00:03:43.650> significant<00:03:44.190> spacing

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
text we have a significant spacing

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.630 
text we have a significant spacing
between<00:03:44.700> each<00:03:44.910> line<00:03:45.390> again<00:03:46.200> I<00:03:46.500> might<00:03:47.310> rank<00:03:47.520> a

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
between each line again I might rank a

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.850 
between each line again I might rank a
little<00:03:47.670> high<00:03:47.970> on<00:03:48.239> the<00:03:48.540> nerd<00:03:48.750> ometer<00:03:49.140> but<00:03:49.709> it's

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
little high on the nerd ometer but it's

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.050 
little high on the nerd ometer but it's
going<00:03:50.010> to<00:03:50.070> make<00:03:50.220> a<00:03:50.250> significant<00:03:50.820> difference

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
going to make a significant difference

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.330 
going to make a significant difference
to<00:03:51.180> how<00:03:51.330> your<00:03:51.540> bullets<00:03:52.050> are<00:03:52.170> read<00:03:52.380> so<00:03:52.890> all<00:03:53.190> I

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
to how your bullets are read so all I

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.770 
to how your bullets are read so all I
need<00:03:53.400> to<00:03:53.550> do<00:03:53.610> now<00:03:53.760> is<00:03:53.910> just<00:03:54.030> duplicate<00:03:54.480> this

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
need to do now is just duplicate this

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.590 
need to do now is just duplicate this
and<00:03:55.020> make<00:03:55.860> a<00:03:56.040> do<00:03:56.580> the<00:03:56.670> same<00:03:56.850> thing<00:03:57.060> for<00:03:57.330> an

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
and make a do the same thing for an

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.420 
and make a do the same thing for an
ordered<00:03:57.989> list<00:03:58.020> right<00:03:58.470> but<00:03:59.100> on<00:03:59.280> that

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
ordered list right but on that

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.100 
ordered list right but on that
essentially<00:03:59.700> that's<00:03:59.850> the<00:04:00.000> tip<00:04:00.180> it<00:04:00.750> makes<00:04:00.959> a

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
essentially that's the tip it makes a

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.530 
essentially that's the tip it makes a
big<00:04:01.260> difference<00:04:01.290> and<00:04:01.770> I<00:04:02.160> hope<00:04:02.430> you'll<00:04:02.610> look<00:04:03.360> at

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
big difference and I hope you'll look at

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.479 
big difference and I hope you'll look at
using<00:04:03.720> that<00:04:03.989> for<00:04:04.320> your<00:04:04.530> future<00:04:04.890> courses<00:04:05.100> it

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
using that for your future courses it

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.970 
using that for your future courses it
makes<00:04:05.640> a<00:04:05.760> big<00:04:05.940> difference
