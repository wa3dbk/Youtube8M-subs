00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
phone in terms of design it definitely

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.090 
phone in terms of design it definitely
looks<00:01:39.450> rugged<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.170> looks<00:01:40.409> like<00:01:40.500> it's<00:01:40.950> a

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
looks rugged and it looks like it's a

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.010 
looks rugged and it looks like it's a
case<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:41.579> can<00:01:41.729> take<00:01:41.880> abuse<00:01:42.240> which<00:01:42.570> may<00:01:42.840> be<00:01:42.899> a

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
case that can take abuse which may be a

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.810 
case that can take abuse which may be a
good<00:01:43.350> or<00:01:43.439> bad<00:01:43.470> thing<00:01:43.860> depending<00:01:44.009> on<00:01:44.430> what<00:01:44.610> kind

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
good or bad thing depending on what kind

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.730 
good or bad thing depending on what kind
of<00:01:44.909> style<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.509> like<00:01:45.689> but<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.380> comes<00:01:46.560> in

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
of style you like but it comes in

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.530 
of style you like but it comes in
multiple<00:01:46.890> colors<00:01:47.159> so<00:01:47.670> hopefully<00:01:48.119> you'll<00:01:48.390> be

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
multiple colors so hopefully you'll be

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.630 
multiple colors so hopefully you'll be
able<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.780> find<00:01:49.020> something<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.500> like<00:01:49.710> now<00:01:50.340> one

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
able to find something you like now one

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.490 
able to find something you like now one
thing<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:51.000> don't<00:01:51.060> like<00:01:51.420> about<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.869> case<00:01:52.049> is<00:01:52.259> the

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
thing I don't like about the case is the

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.350 
thing I don't like about the case is the
built-in<00:01:52.829> screen<00:01:53.009> protector<00:01:53.189> makes<00:01:54.180> the

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
built-in screen protector makes the

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.420 
built-in screen protector makes the
phone<00:01:54.570> seem<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:54.990> little<00:01:55.380> bit<00:01:55.470> less<00:01:55.710> responsive

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
phone seem a little bit less responsive

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.580 
phone seem a little bit less responsive
and<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:57.030> also<00:01:57.270> degrades<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.780> quality<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.409> the

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
and it also degrades the quality of the

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.679 
and it also degrades the quality of the
screen<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.890> little<00:01:59.040> bit<00:01:59.189> so<00:01:59.549> what<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.119> did<00:02:00.420> on<00:02:00.659> my

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
screen a little bit so what I did on my

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.020 
screen a little bit so what I did on my
iPhone<00:02:01.170> 5s<00:02:01.590> case<00:02:01.619> was<00:02:02.159> just<00:02:02.430> pulled<00:02:02.759> out<00:02:02.909> the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
iPhone 5s case was just pulled out the

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.090 
iPhone 5s case was just pulled out the
screen<00:02:03.270> protector<00:02:03.390> because<00:02:04.229> it's<00:02:04.560> just<00:02:04.829> glued

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
screen protector because it's just glued

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.590 
screen protector because it's just glued
in<00:02:05.280> so<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.610> is<00:02:05.759> definitely<00:02:06.210> something<00:02:06.450> you

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
in so that is definitely something you

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.630 
in so that is definitely something you
can<00:02:06.719> do<00:02:07.020> on<00:02:07.259> this<00:02:07.409> case<00:02:07.680> if<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.069> don't<00:02:08.250> like<00:02:08.459> it

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
can do on this case if you don't like it

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.309 
can do on this case if you don't like it
that's<00:02:08.970> all<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.390> have<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.780> say<00:02:09.810> about<00:02:10.110> the

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
that's all I have to say about the

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.900 
that's all I have to say about the
OtterBox<00:02:10.709> Defender<00:02:10.800> I've<00:02:11.430> reviewed<00:02:11.730> this

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
OtterBox Defender I've reviewed this

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.360 
OtterBox Defender I've reviewed this
case<00:02:11.970> before<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:12.900> much

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
case before and much

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.039 
case before and much
hasn't<00:02:13.610> changed<00:02:13.670> but<00:02:14.180> I<00:02:14.269> just<00:02:14.420> want<00:02:14.599> to<00:02:14.659> see<00:02:14.840> if

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049 
hasn't changed but I just want to see if

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:17.050 
hasn't changed but I just want to see if
it<00:02:15.200> can<00:02:15.349> protect<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:15.799> iPhone<00:02:16.129> 6<00:02:16.459> the<00:02:16.580> same<00:02:16.909> way

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
it can protect the iPhone 6 the same way

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.210 
it can protect the iPhone 6 the same way
it<00:02:17.120> used<00:02:17.330> to<00:02:17.510> protect<00:02:17.959> the<00:02:18.409> older<00:02:18.709> iPhones<00:02:19.040> as

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
it used to protect the older iPhones as

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.759 
it used to protect the older iPhones as

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
driveway I'm going to do the same test

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.690 
driveway I'm going to do the same test
with<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.430> case<00:02:38.269> for<00:02:38.629> the<00:02:38.780> iPhone<00:02:39.200> 6<00:02:39.590> so<00:02:39.829> here's

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
with the case for the iPhone 6 so here's

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.100 
with the case for the iPhone 6 so here's
the<00:02:40.879> iPhone<00:02:41.299> 6

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
the iPhone 6

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.979 
the iPhone 6
inside<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:42.680> OtterBox<00:02:43.129> Defender<00:02:43.280> and<00:02:43.989> we're

inside the OtterBox Defender and we're

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.119 
inside the OtterBox Defender and we're
going<00:02:45.110> to<00:02:45.140> go<00:02:45.290> ahead<00:02:45.349> and<00:02:45.590> toss<00:02:45.769> this<00:02:45.890> out<00:02:45.980> the

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
going to go ahead and toss this out the

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:48.520 
going to go ahead and toss this out the
window<00:02:46.220> here<00:02:46.640> hopefully<00:02:47.239> it<00:02:47.540> holds<00:02:48.049> up<00:02:48.290> to<00:02:48.410> the

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
window here hopefully it holds up to the
