00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:05.050
 good kids how are you doing today we are going to 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.460
 have a very interesting video and as I already 

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.620
 you know I do not usually make that statement in 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.480
 particular at the beginning of my videos or 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.670
 I usually say before I usually say if it's a 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.900
 guide or something but interesting said 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.129
 that statement has to be made with 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.750
 careful but I think I 'm 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:18.850
 trained rather than the user of 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.130
 redit did not suffer by the way very good 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.019
 name is quite capable for 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.180
 do it since I leave a post with how it 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:27.010
 imagine the assault mode in battlefield 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.500
 5 that as you know is planned for 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.240
 leave in 2016 as I really tell you the 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.619
 message is yours but I want it 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.200
 transmit since I think an idea 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.180
 excellent and very worthy to comment on 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.070
 post titled that's how I visualize the 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.020
 jump in battlefield 5 starts going to the 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.490
 grain describing this situation the 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.960
 attacking team starts on a plane of 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.670
 transport is a minute of 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.980
 minute discharge area during which 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.540
 We could choose our equipment is 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.370
 at night but in the dark they follow 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.350
 watching and hearing the explosions the plane 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.790
 it wobbles a red light comes on and 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.890
 among other colleagues you put the 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.510
 parachute lights up sets a light 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.270
 Green is the time to jump your 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.310
 squad of 36 people jump while 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.470
 the sky is filled with explosions and bullets 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.210
 tracer on the ground alone and without knowing 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.650
 where is the rest of your team you join 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.280
 to the first mate who finds 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.750
 the assault has begun please start 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.550
 to describe a little how would they be in 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.260
 yes under the conditions of the base but it is 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.060
 that this last paragraph has been 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.650
 too epic you read it getting into the 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.600
 paper or you do not read it but in addition to 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.610
 write superbly epic stories 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.350
 this user also knows how to write modes 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.880
 of play rather translate them to true 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.280
 historical frame in their head the in 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.200
 khoms would be howitt sets of 88 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.700
 millimeters that you have on screen and you 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.320
 they should destroy two to move to the 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.760
 next base also describes between 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.950
 quotes the shape of the base of each 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.420
 hobbit be would have a good trench and 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.979
 a nest of machine guns for the 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.470
 defenders every time you spend a 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.060
 base you get two sherman tanks that 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.860
 new you have on screen and so we add 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.270
 a little more to the great message of this 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.520
 phenomenon as a last condition the 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.530
 defenders would have panzers in the third 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.600
 and howitt's fourth location would be 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.800
 the best some already sounds this to you and 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.090
 especially those that you have seen the 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.590
 principle of blood brothers since 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.390
 as he says this is basically the 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.340
 start of band of brothers series of the 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.510
 which proceeds the sheet stay now and 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.340
 since we refer to the image 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.140
 thank you very much to Quique for helping me 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.179
 to choose the truth is that he has done 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.100
 a good job as you can see and how 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.720
 not taking into account the tonic of everything 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.980
 the post the explanation ends with a 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.180
 epic affirmation 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.550
 and ready for another game of the second 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.200
 world war the time has come and 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.370
 it is at this precise moment that he 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.840
 the soundtrack comes to mind 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.280
 debate the film I imagine all the 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.709
 possibilities that could also bring 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.030
 I like this message a lot because here 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.590
 about the potential that demonstrates 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.660
 community discusses the film makes you think 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.040
 that if we could collaborate a little 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.900
 more on how the game is going to be 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.970
 play for nothing more and nothing less than 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.799
 two years we could do much more 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.750
 let's hope they hear us in the future 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:42.190
 of course the post did not take long to receive 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.319
 voting at the time when 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.840
 write this video has 426 plus mine 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.519
 what am I going to give him now that they do 427 and 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.379
 all the comments you have are from 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.790
 I support a support that of course I 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:52.840
 I share as I tell you the truth is 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.700
 that this message has given me the 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.230
 opportunity to tell you about something 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.609
 who had wanted to talk for a long time 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.500
 of how I would like them to be 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:01.299
 shooters that will come out soon as the 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.849
 Futuristic games start to tire me 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.980
 a little bit or a little bit really like 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.090
 says nose I think it's time to 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.920
 get back to having a game of the second 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.540
 world war or at least one set 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.489
 in an older time and this 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.540
 it really would not only benefit the 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.250
 multiplayer but that would give 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.870
 unlimited possibilities to the campaign 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.670
 imagine the stories for the way one 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.290
 player who could ride with a 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.470
 scenario like this especially if you dedicate in 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.630
 all the effort what 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.370
 to imagine futuristic toys 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.840
 imagine a better story with the 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.810
 fair equipment that in my opinion 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.220
 it would be a thousand times better unfortunately 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.440
 moment it is not possible for us to see the 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.360
 supposed game until 2016 at least in the 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.770
 plane battlefield since rumors that 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.240
 the next call of duty could be 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.890
 set in the Second World War 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.420
 and what do you want me to tell you I do not feel 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.860
 that great rivalry of code versus 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.050
 battlefield I gave for the quality 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.850
 real game so they take out an elbow 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.680
 set in the past and it's good for 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.870
 course it is very likely that it brings you 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.370
 content to the channel I do not see why not and 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.720
 good kids that would be all for the 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.800
 today's video if you liked it I did not 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.270
 you have to thank me 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.100
 really what I would like most is that 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.300
 If you have a reddit account, you will give it to them 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.620
 a little hand up to the post of this 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.630
 user that I will leave in the description 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.130
 and with a little luck even a 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.200
 battlefield developer could 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.730
 see how it has happened on other occasions 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.440
 obviously it is not a result 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.810
 direct or tangible but equal it in 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.870
 Many times they consider leaving the future 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.980
 in the past so nothing said that I 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.730
 dismissal 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.730
 goodbye kids 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.550
 Hello
