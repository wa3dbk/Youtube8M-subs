that came with it what you see here are
seven<00:00:34.070> of<00:00:34.190> our<00:00:34.790> seventeen<00:00:35.329> point<00:00:35.660> twenty

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
seven of our seventeen point twenty

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.229 
seven of our seventeen point twenty
seven<00:00:36.170> five<00:00:36.379> grades<00:00:36.680> with<00:00:37.399> a<00:00:37.430> nice<00:00:37.730> little<00:00:38.030> two

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
seven five grades with a nice little two

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.779 
seven five grades with a nice little two
inch<00:00:38.270> gap<00:00:38.750> on<00:00:38.989> either<00:00:39.050> side<00:00:39.739> that's<00:00:40.370> a<00:00:40.610> good

00:00:40.779 --> 00:00:40.789 
inch gap on either side that's a good

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:42.400 
inch gap on either side that's a good
thing<00:00:41.030> because<00:00:41.420> these<00:00:41.750> grades<00:00:42.079> are<00:00:42.230> going<00:00:42.320> to

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
thing because these grades are going to

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.190 
thing because these grades are going to
capture<00:00:42.680> a<00:00:42.980> ton<00:00:43.430> more<00:00:43.789> heat<00:00:44.210> and<00:00:44.420> keep<00:00:45.020> it

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
capture a ton more heat and keep it

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.139 
capture a ton more heat and keep it
trapped<00:00:45.530> under<00:00:45.980> the<00:00:46.100> grates<00:00:46.370> themselves<00:00:47.000> so

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
trapped under the grates themselves so

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:49.569 
trapped under the grates themselves so
these<00:00:47.300> will<00:00:47.539> radiate<00:00:47.960> and<00:00:48.230> run<00:00:48.410> very<00:00:48.710> high<00:00:48.949> but

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
these will radiate and run very high but

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:50.770 
these will radiate and run very high but
what<00:00:49.730> you're<00:00:49.910> not<00:00:50.000> going<00:00:50.239> to<00:00:50.329> be<00:00:50.420> doing<00:00:50.570> is

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
what you're not going to be doing is

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.479 
what you're not going to be doing is
heating<00:00:51.110> the<00:00:51.230> air<00:00:51.260> as<00:00:51.620> much<00:00:51.829> as<00:00:52.010> you<00:00:52.129> do<00:00:52.250> with

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
heating the air as much as you do with

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:53.950 
heating the air as much as you do with
these<00:00:52.670> grates<00:00:52.969> there's<00:00:53.359> another<00:00:53.570> way<00:00:53.750> this

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
these grates there's another way this

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.529 
these grates there's another way this
gap<00:00:54.199> comes<00:00:54.649> your<00:00:54.920> friend<00:00:55.219> instead<00:00:56.090> of<00:00:56.300> the<00:00:56.390> gap

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
gap comes your friend instead of the gap

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:58.660 
gap comes your friend instead of the gap
being<00:00:56.780> on<00:00:56.930> either<00:00:57.050> side<00:00:57.440> here<00:00:57.770> I've<00:00:58.219> got<00:00:58.399> it<00:00:58.550> in

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
being on either side here I've got it in

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.279 
being on either side here I've got it in
the<00:00:58.730> center<00:00:59.120> so<00:00:59.780> I've<00:00:59.870> got<00:01:00.050> these<00:01:00.230> three

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 
the center so I've got these three

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:02.590 
the center so I've got these three
grates<00:01:00.829> perched<00:01:01.340> over<00:01:01.699> these<00:01:01.879> three<00:01:02.120> burners

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
grates perched over these three burners

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.890 
grates perched over these three burners
so<00:01:02.840> we<00:01:03.469> can<00:01:03.620> run<00:01:03.859> super<00:01:04.250> hot<00:01:04.489> here<00:01:04.940> and<00:01:05.120> not<00:01:05.630> so

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
so we can run super hot here and not so

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.380 
so we can run super hot here and not so
here<00:01:06.260> you<00:01:06.740> can<00:01:06.860> do<00:01:06.980> some<00:01:07.160> really<00:01:07.400> nice<00:01:07.730> extreme

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
here you can do some really nice extreme

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.690 
here you can do some really nice extreme
zoning<00:01:09.380> if<00:01:09.500> you<00:01:09.650> will<00:01:09.860> when<00:01:10.430> you're<00:01:10.520> not

connecting<00:01:11.270> the<00:01:11.360> grates<00:01:11.600> you're<00:01:11.810> not

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
connecting the grates you're not

aggressively vegetable so this looks to

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.540 
aggressively vegetable so this looks to
be<00:01:35.210> a<00:01:35.240> nice<00:01:35.450> little<00:01:35.780> handy<00:01:36.170> device<00:01:36.320> to<00:01:37.280> allow

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
be a nice little handy device to allow

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.120 
be a nice little handy device to allow
us<00:01:37.760> to<00:01:37.880> create<00:01:38.600> a<00:01:38.660> lid<00:01:39.200> of<00:01:39.320> fact<00:01:39.530> because<00:01:39.680> a<00:01:39.860> lot

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
us to create a lid of fact because a lot

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.320 
us to create a lid of fact because a lot
of<00:01:40.160> the<00:01:40.400> event<00:01:40.700> girls<00:01:40.970> have<00:01:41.180> you've<00:01:41.300> seen

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
of the event girls have you've seen

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.440 
of the event girls have you've seen
don't<00:01:42.260> come<00:01:42.830> with<00:01:43.100> lids<00:01:43.310> and<00:01:43.610> there<00:01:44.240> are<00:01:44.300> times

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
don't come with lids and there are times

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.970 
don't come with lids and there are times
of<00:01:44.660> you<00:01:44.780> need<00:01:44.930> water<00:01:45.110> first<00:01:45.650> thing<00:01:45.860> I'm

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:45.980 
of you need water first thing I'm

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.490 
of you need water first thing I'm
noticing<00:01:46.010> is<00:01:46.550> I've<00:01:46.820> down<00:01:47.120> below<00:01:47.600> most<00:01:47.810> to<00:01:48.260> run

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
noticing is I've down below most to run

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.860 
noticing is I've down below most to run
off<00:01:48.800> and<00:01:49.790> I'm<00:01:50.150> almost<00:01:50.720> on<00:01:51.140> for<00:01:52.600> 6500<00:01:53.600> it'd<00:01:53.780> be

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:53.870 
off and I'm almost on for 6500 it'd be

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.260 
off and I'm almost on for 6500 it'd be
great<00:01:54.020> so<00:01:54.470> with<00:01:55.400> the<00:01:55.610> one<00:01:55.760> of<00:01:55.820> the<00:01:55.910> lowest

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
great so with the one of the lowest

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.510 
great so with the one of the lowest
settings<00:01:56.600> possible<00:01:56.810> we're<00:01:57.770> creating<00:01:58.070> really

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
settings possible we're creating really

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.270 
settings possible we're creating really
nice<00:01:58.760> heat<00:01:59.560> one<00:02:00.560> of<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:00.650> first<00:02:00.890> things<00:02:01.130> I'm

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
nice heat one of the first things I'm

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.740 
nice heat one of the first things I'm
noticing<00:02:01.370> is<00:02:01.760> look<00:02:01.910> how<00:02:02.030> much<00:02:02.180> we're<00:02:02.510> trapping

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
noticing is look how much we're trapping

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.360 
noticing is look how much we're trapping
under<00:02:03.110> this<00:02:03.200> lid<00:02:03.440> in<00:02:03.530> terms<00:02:03.740> of<00:02:03.890> smoke<00:02:04.190> and

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370 
under this lid in terms of smoke and

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.900 
under this lid in terms of smoke and
stuff

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
stuff

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.780 
stuff
so<00:02:05.270> and<00:02:05.930> what's<00:02:06.650> also<00:02:06.890> happening<00:02:07.400> is<00:02:07.580> there's

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
so and what's also happening is there's

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.670 
so and what's also happening is there's
no<00:02:07.910> question<00:02:08.390> it's<00:02:08.569> aiding<00:02:08.929> in<00:02:09.020> the<00:02:09.170> faster

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:09.680 
no question it's aiding in the faster

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.010 
no question it's aiding in the faster
cook<00:02:09.920> by<00:02:10.100> trapping<00:02:10.369> so<00:02:10.700> much<00:02:10.850> more<00:02:11.060> heat<00:02:11.390> these

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
cook by trapping so much more heat these

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.680 
cook by trapping so much more heat these
are<00:02:12.170> grilling<00:02:12.530> at<00:02:12.650> a<00:02:12.680> much<00:02:12.980> slower<00:02:13.340> rate

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
are grilling at a much slower rate

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.360 
are grilling at a much slower rate
without<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:14.990> lid<00:02:15.170> back<00:02:15.500> these<00:02:15.710> guys<00:02:15.740> are

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
without the lid back these guys are

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.950 
without the lid back these guys are
close<00:02:16.640> to<00:02:16.820> done<00:02:17.000> we're<00:02:17.240> almost<00:02:17.360> ready<00:02:17.690> to<00:02:17.810> make

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
close to done we're almost ready to make

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:26.410 
close to done we're almost ready to make
you<00:02:22.390> my<00:02:23.390> favorite<00:02:23.750> sounds<00:02:24.050> in<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.230> world
