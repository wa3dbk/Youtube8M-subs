that it's totally acceptable that you

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.979 
that it's totally acceptable that you
lose<00:02:23.400> those<00:02:23.700> couple<00:02:24.120> of<00:02:24.150> pages<00:02:24.630> because<00:02:24.870> you

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
lose those couple of pages because you

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.410 
lose those couple of pages because you
do<00:02:25.140> get<00:02:25.290> them<00:02:25.470> back<00:02:25.650> here<00:02:25.980> anyway<00:02:26.730> I<00:02:26.850> hope<00:02:27.209> you
