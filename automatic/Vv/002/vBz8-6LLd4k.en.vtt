00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:05.569 
all right here here's a video showing

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:08.530 
all right here here's a video showing
these<00:00:06.569> add<00:00:06.750> eh<00:00:07.049> one<00:00:07.290> two<00:00:07.440> three

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:08.540 
these add eh one two three

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.940 
these add eh one two three
so<00:00:09.540> I<00:00:09.570> like<00:00:09.780> 15<00:00:10.170> I'm<00:00:10.320> not<00:00:10.500> actually<00:00:10.620> better

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
so I like 15 I'm not actually better

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.419 
so I like 15 I'm not actually better
than<00:00:12.200> them<00:00:13.200> RC<00:00:13.559> decoder<00:00:13.889> that<00:00:13.980> you<00:00:14.160> would<00:00:14.250> get

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
than them RC decoder that you would get

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.650 
than them RC decoder that you would get
I<00:00:14.670> think<00:00:16.520> so<00:00:17.520> just<00:00:17.550> pull<00:00:17.910> this<00:00:18.029> off<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.600> do

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
I think so just pull this off and do

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:27.650 
I think so just pull this off and do
that<00:00:25.670> yeah<00:00:26.670> this<00:00:26.880> this<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.359> this<00:00:27.480> little

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
that yeah this this is this little

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.020 
that yeah this this is this little
decoder<00:00:28.109> here<00:00:28.460> this<00:00:29.460> blue<00:00:30.449> part<00:00:30.689> here<00:00:32.030> and

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
decoder here this blue part here and

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.380 
decoder here this blue part here and
then<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:33.420> just<00:00:33.570> comes<00:00:33.840> off<00:00:34.079> like<00:00:35.180> it<00:00:36.180> comes

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
then it just comes off like it comes

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.510 
then it just comes off like it comes
with<00:00:36.570> wires<00:00:36.780> connected<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.649> it<00:00:37.770> like<00:00:37.980> this<00:00:38.219> and

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
with wires connected to it like this and

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.500 
with wires connected to it like this and
they're<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.360> lot<00:00:39.570> longer<00:00:41.120> but<00:00:42.120> that's<00:00:42.270> for

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
they're a lot longer but that's for

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.779 
they're a lot longer but that's for
hardwiring<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.200> know<00:00:43.320> stuff<00:00:43.590> but<00:00:44.550> all<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.760> I

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
hardwiring you know stuff but all you I

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:53.090 
hardwiring you know stuff but all you I
do<00:00:44.989> is<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:48.469> pull<00:00:49.469> this<00:00:49.649> off<00:00:51.739> pull<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:52.829> off<00:00:52.920> the

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
do is I pull this off pull it off the

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.770 
do is I pull this off pull it off the
wire<00:00:53.250> mount<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:53.820> it's<00:00:53.969> on<00:00:54.120> when<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.539> comes

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
wire mount that it's on when it comes

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.569 
wire mount that it's on when it comes
and<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:55.530> might<00:00:55.710> type<00:00:55.890> forget<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.340> might<00:00:56.460> not

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
and I might type forget it might not

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.639 
and I might type forget it might not
even<00:00:56.699> come<00:00:56.940> with<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.120> wire<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:58.320> wire<00:00:58.530> is

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
even come with a wire the wire is

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.900 
even come with a wire the wire is
connected<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.539> but<00:01:00.539> if<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.719> does<00:01:01.820> pull<00:01:02.820> it

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
connected to it but if it does pull it

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.500 
connected to it but if it does pull it
off<00:01:06.290> look<00:01:07.290> at<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:08.180> that's<00:01:09.180> what<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.390> comes

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
off look at that that's what it comes

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.260 
off look at that that's what it comes
out<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.720> be<00:01:09.869> like<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.380> then<00:01:10.500> just<00:01:10.790> has<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.820> 9<00:01:12.090> pin

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
out to be like and then just has a 9 pin

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.660 
out to be like and then just has a 9 pin
plug<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.659> then<00:01:12.750> if<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.439> take<00:01:13.590> her<00:01:13.799> dummy<00:01:14.369> plug

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
plug and then if you take her dummy plug

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.920 
plug and then if you take her dummy plug
off<00:01:15.509> that's<00:01:16.320> what<00:01:16.530> Guildford<00:01:16.920> 681<00:01:17.430> told<00:01:18.060> me<00:01:18.180> it

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
off that's what Guildford 681 told me it

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.260 
off that's what Guildford 681 told me it
was<00:01:19.080> called<00:01:19.340> you<00:01:20.340> got<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.520> take<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:20.790> off

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
was called you got to take that off

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.420 
was called you got to take that off
you<00:01:22.049> just<00:01:22.259> look<00:01:22.380> at<00:01:22.500> Guilford's<00:01:22.890> video<00:01:23.159> but

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
you just look at Guilford's video but

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.060 
you just look at Guilford's video but
you<00:01:24.030> got<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.240> take<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:25.200> part<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.799> like<00:01:25.979> a

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
you got to take that that part is like a

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.010 
you got to take that that part is like a
thin<00:01:26.400> thing<00:01:26.729> at<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.909> top<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.330> saw<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.750> on<00:01:27.840> your

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
thin thing at the top I saw it on your

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.069 
thin thing at the top I saw it on your
dash<00:01:28.439> 9<00:01:28.740> but<00:01:29.640> this<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:30.329> part<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.780> then<00:01:30.900> you

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
dash 9 but this this part and then you

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.940 
dash 9 but this this part and then you
just<00:01:31.350> plug<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.590> into<00:01:31.829> there<00:01:32.299> do<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.509> and

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
just plug it into there do that and

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.810 
just plug it into there do that and
that's<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.040> decoder<00:01:35.990> show<00:01:36.990> no<00:01:37.799> it's<00:01:38.700> really

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
that's the decoder show no it's really

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.310 
that's the decoder show no it's really
not<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.060> hard<00:01:39.329> it's<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.750> lot<00:01:39.930> cheaper<00:01:39.960> than

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
not that hard it's a lot cheaper than

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.950 
not that hard it's a lot cheaper than
the<00:01:40.500> MRC<00:01:40.890> one<00:01:41.070> you're<00:01:41.189> getting<00:01:41.600> and<00:01:42.600> it's<00:01:42.869> a

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
the MRC one you're getting and it's a

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.830 
the MRC one you're getting and it's a
good<00:01:43.110> decoder<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.680> mean<00:01:43.950> nothing<00:01:44.630> it's<00:01:45.630> for

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
good decoder I mean nothing it's for

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.310 
good decoder I mean nothing it's for
light<00:01:45.990> functions<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.680> on<00:01:48.140> everything<00:01:49.140> in<00:01:49.229> an

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
light functions and on everything in an

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.350 
light functions and on everything in an
RT<00:01:50.100> R<00:01:50.250> Dash<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.640> on<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.909> works<00:01:51.090> fine<00:01:52.399> so<00:01:53.399> that's

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
RT R Dash and on it works fine so that's

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.719 
RT R Dash and on it works fine so that's
it<00:01:54.540> it<00:01:54.840> just<00:01:54.990> sits<00:01:55.200> there<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.340> just<00:01:56.520> pull

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
it it just sits there and you just pull

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.280 
it it just sits there and you just pull
it<00:01:56.759> off<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.119> then<00:01:58.460> you<00:01:59.460> know<00:02:00.020> put<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.079> back

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
it off and then you know put it back

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.520 
it off and then you know put it back
thanks<00:02:02.189> oh<00:02:02.630> yeah<00:02:03.630> I'm<00:02:03.960> going<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.229> check<00:02:04.290> if

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
thanks oh yeah I'm going to check if

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:30.840 
thanks oh yeah I'm going to check if
this<00:02:04.649> works

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.450 

yeah<00:02:31.850> it<00:02:31.940> works<00:02:32.770> right<00:02:33.770> now<00:02:33.980> there's<00:02:34.220> just<00:02:34.280> a

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
yeah it works right now there's just a

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.020 
yeah it works right now there's just a
wire<00:02:34.640> hitting<00:02:35.060> inside<00:02:35.660> the<00:02:35.840> ends<00:02:36.020> and<00:02:37.030> you

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
wire hitting inside the ends and you

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.160 
wire hitting inside the ends and you
don't<00:02:38.180> want<00:02:38.330> to<00:02:38.360> make<00:02:38.480> sure<00:02:38.510> there's<00:02:38.840> a<00:02:38.930> large

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
don't want to make sure there's a large

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:46.810 
don't want to make sure there's a large
need<00:02:41.320> yeah<00:02:42.790> yeah<00:02:43.790> our<00:02:43.910> drives<00:02:45.670> doesn't<00:02:46.670> want

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
need yeah yeah our drives doesn't want

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.540 
need yeah yeah our drives doesn't want
to<00:02:46.880> tuck<00:02:47.060> them<00:02:47.270> wires<00:02:47.540> up<00:02:47.780> in<00:02:47.930> there<00:02:48.550> for

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
to tuck them wires up in there for

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.660 
to tuck them wires up in there for
finding<00:02:49.970> any<00:02:50.090> drives<00:02:51.250> what<00:02:52.250> to<00:02:52.340> make<00:02:52.490> sure

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
finding any drives what to make sure

00:02:52.670 --> 00:03:05.790 
finding any drives what to make sure
that
