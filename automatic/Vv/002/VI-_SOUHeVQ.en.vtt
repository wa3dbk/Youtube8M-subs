we<00:03:24.780> think<00:03:24.990> both<00:03:25.140> of<00:03:25.350> these<00:03:25.470> dresses<00:03:25.680> are

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
we think both of these dresses are

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.170 
we think both of these dresses are
really<00:03:26.130> beautiful<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:26.520> was<00:03:26.700> actually<00:03:26.820> quite

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
really beautiful and was actually quite

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.880 
really beautiful and was actually quite
hard<00:03:27.450> to<00:03:27.720> choose<00:03:28.110> from<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:28.470> collection

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
hard to choose from the collection

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.350 
hard to choose from the collection
because<00:03:29.190> as<00:03:29.340> a<00:03:29.370> whole<00:03:29.640> it's<00:03:29.850> really<00:03:30.180> really

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
because as a whole it's really really

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.770 
because as a whole it's really really
pretty

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
pretty

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.060 
pretty
because<00:03:31.260> they're<00:03:31.440> Debenhams<00:03:31.800> they're<00:03:31.950> not

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
because they're Debenhams they're not

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.710 
because they're Debenhams they're not
actually<00:03:32.370> that<00:03:32.460> expensive<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.210> blue<00:03:33.360> one<00:03:33.570> was

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
actually that expensive the blue one was

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.340 
actually that expensive the blue one was
104<00:03:34.530> and<00:03:34.770> the<00:03:35.520> gold<00:03:35.820> one<00:03:36.090> was<00:03:36.270> 72<00:03:36.900> we<00:03:37.080> actually

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
104 and the gold one was 72 we actually

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.840 
104 and the gold one was 72 we actually
got<00:03:37.440> them<00:03:37.620> for<00:03:37.680> 20%<00:03:38.010> off<00:03:38.220> in<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.430> sale<00:03:38.640> though

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
got them for 20% off in the sale though

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.220 
got them for 20% off in the sale though
they<00:03:39.150> were<00:03:39.210> a<00:03:39.330> little<00:03:39.510> bit<00:03:39.690> cheaper<00:03:39.990> than<00:03:40.020> they

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
they were a little bit cheaper than they

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.500 
they were a little bit cheaper than they
normally<00:03:40.380> would<00:03:40.710> be<00:03:40.740> now<00:03:41.700> this<00:03:41.880> final<00:03:42.150> dress

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
normally would be now this final dress

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.450 
normally would be now this final dress
is<00:03:42.750> actually<00:03:43.110> one<00:03:43.290> for<00:03:43.500> a<00:03:43.530> monsoon<00:03:44.070> and<00:03:44.340> one

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:44.460 
is actually one for a monsoon and one

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.670 
is actually one for a monsoon and one
that<00:03:44.580> we<00:03:44.670> both<00:03:44.880> think<00:03:45.120> is<00:03:45.300> really<00:03:45.720> pretty<00:03:45.870> it's

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
that we both think is really pretty it's

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.680 
that we both think is really pretty it's
got<00:03:46.830> a<00:03:46.860> slight<00:03:47.190> Vera<00:03:47.580> Wang<00:03:47.850> edge<00:03:48.090> to<00:03:48.360> it

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
got a slight Vera Wang edge to it

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.870 
got a slight Vera Wang edge to it
it's<00:03:48.930> really<00:03:49.410> beautiful<00:03:49.860> great<00:03:50.130> fabric<00:03:50.640> a

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
it's really beautiful great fabric a

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.180 
it's really beautiful great fabric a
long<00:03:51.450> full-bodied<00:03:52.140> skirt<00:03:52.500> and<00:03:52.830> a<00:03:52.860> really

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
long full-bodied skirt and a really

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.490 
long full-bodied skirt and a really
pretty<00:03:53.430> neckline<00:03:53.940> there's<00:03:54.780> a<00:03:54.840> jeweled<00:03:55.170> belt

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
pretty neckline there's a jeweled belt

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.140 
pretty neckline there's a jeweled belt
which<00:03:55.740> is<00:03:55.920> great<00:03:56.160> as<00:03:56.340> it<00:03:56.460> pulls<00:03:56.700> it<00:03:56.850> in<00:03:56.940> round

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
which is great as it pulls it in round

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.670 
which is great as it pulls it in round
the<00:03:57.240> waistline<00:03:57.720> but<00:03:57.990> we<00:03:58.080> thought<00:03:58.290> this<00:03:58.500> could

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
the waistline but we thought this could

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.380 
the waistline but we thought this could
be<00:03:58.710> made<00:03:58.980> prettier<00:03:59.400> perhaps<00:03:59.730> with<00:03:59.910> a<00:03:59.970> vintage

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
be made prettier perhaps with a vintage

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.880 
be made prettier perhaps with a vintage
belt<00:04:00.690> to<00:04:00.900> make<00:04:01.050> it<00:04:01.200> even<00:04:01.320> nicer

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
belt to make it even nicer

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.520 
belt to make it even nicer
it's<00:04:02.250> 169<00:04:03.240> pounds<00:04:03.510> so<00:04:03.840> puts<00:04:04.050> it<00:04:04.200> at<00:04:04.290> the<00:04:04.320> most

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
it's 169 pounds so puts it at the most

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.710 
it's 169 pounds so puts it at the most
expensive<00:04:04.950> of<00:04:05.280> all<00:04:05.460> our<00:04:05.610> dresses<00:04:05.790> but<00:04:06.420> perhaps

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
expensive of all our dresses but perhaps

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.270 
expensive of all our dresses but perhaps
if<00:04:06.900> you<00:04:06.990> only<00:04:07.140> had<00:04:07.350> one<00:04:07.530> or<00:04:07.680> two<00:04:07.710> bridesmaids

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
if you only had one or two bridesmaids

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.820 
if you only had one or two bridesmaids
it<00:04:08.520> would<00:04:08.610> make<00:04:08.730> a<00:04:08.760> beautiful<00:04:09.150> choice<00:04:09.830> okay

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
format of this video I know it's a

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.360 
format of this video I know it's a
little<00:04:16.080> bit<00:04:16.230> ad-hoc<00:04:16.650> because<00:04:16.950> obviously<00:04:17.100> it's

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
little bit ad-hoc because obviously it's

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.460 
little bit ad-hoc because obviously it's
not<00:04:17.549> kind<00:04:18.150> of<00:04:18.239> this<00:04:18.690> is<00:04:18.870> the<00:04:19.020> brightness<00:04:19.440> just

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
not kind of this is the brightness just

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:20.810 
not kind of this is the brightness just
you<00:04:19.709> want<00:04:19.859> to<00:04:19.920> buy<00:04:20.010> but<00:04:20.280> we<00:04:20.400> just<00:04:20.580> thought<00:04:20.700> we

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
you want to buy but we just thought we

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.159 
you want to buy but we just thought we
would<00:04:20.910> do<00:04:21.030> a<00:04:21.060> video<00:04:21.510> showing<00:04:21.810> you<00:04:21.900> what<00:04:22.080> you

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
can get on high street because you can

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.920 
can get on high street because you can
get<00:04:23.460> some<00:04:23.669> really<00:04:24.210> great<00:04:24.419> stuff<00:04:24.720> and<00:04:24.870> you
