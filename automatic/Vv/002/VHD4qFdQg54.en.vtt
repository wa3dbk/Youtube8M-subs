00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.150

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.740
 campaign go for in the cinema tone the 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.929
 located on the roman hill 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.790
 tonight we're going to see who got that 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.710
 we would find the best looks I 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.710
 accompany this is three tacos 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:39.100
 white sox those of the cb and the blouse 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.230
 because nothing like that is and with the weather when 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:52.410
 it gets rainy and fur jackets me 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.410
 love and bags that I would never wear 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.550
 The truth is that I ran out on 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:28.290
 you bring a brand of pants zara 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:32.400
 and even from h &amp; m and balise shoes 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.350
 vintage clock designer rings 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.210
 I always bring many rings and my 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.610
 tattoos that are also part of what 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.940
 there is always my necklace will also be the 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.940
 neon 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.320
 I'm dark and suddenly I look like the 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.660
 if you're attracted to the blogger look 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.010
 very proud as an actionist his hands are not 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.350
 like all the detail the speakers 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.190
 rings and wrists dominated with 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.190
 tattoos that have 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:15.570
 very fast black and white 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.650
 I decided to cover myself a little because of the cold 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.660
 then I took the opportunity to put on a 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.470
 sweater as well as half ones 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.750
 thick 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.580
 and then you can not miss the bag 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.580
 for inside 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.620
 I always always have black jeans 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:50.490
 leggins like your kini is rather a 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.490
 particular brand 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.910
 does not get better 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.959
 well I think a couple of skinny 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.849
 jeans is thus indispensable and also a 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.620
 good black jacket saves you from any 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:08.920
 Trouble well that good since many 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.920
 Thank you 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.050
 very well 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.940
 and paula I love the physical court very 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.010
 Few girls read this cut very well 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:32.150
 children and what was very simple to 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:35.090
 perfect for coming here today and 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.520
 It started to rain but it's summer but 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.660
 they are with a little complicated the climate 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:44.080
 then apply some good colors 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.270
 bardem and so casual with a good flow 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.980
 recent on my feet 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.010
 and you have to lift the look a little bit and 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.720
 nothing else 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.810
 it is so you have to come a little casual 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.090
 we could not come very well either 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.770
 the place is very accessible for clothes and 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.420
 then you already care about an item 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.420
 little bit more wave to the shoe 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.600
 all right 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.040
 the gabardine very good stops the time 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.830
 rainy 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.220
 maybe I was a bit outstanding for the 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.220
 autumn 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.530
 well, they gave me 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.980
 a handkerchief 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:51.490
 in my life but I do not like them I do not put 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:51.490
 many colors almost do not use tennis months 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.450
 thank you thank you for the TV 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:06.110
 and I think it's pretty good 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.110
 it is very little very elegant 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:12.800
 How did you think about the parents? 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.569

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.910
