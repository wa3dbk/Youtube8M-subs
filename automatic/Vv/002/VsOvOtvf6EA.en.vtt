00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.949
 can we say that on the scale 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.109
 videogame one game is worth another no 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.109
 not aesthetically but culturally 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.689
 what value or representation 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.189
 can have a game what you seem 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.439
 to mean is that not all games 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.410
 are not worth it's true and it's a 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.809
 problem because if nothing looks like less 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.190
 a video game that another video game 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.079
 there are not many words for 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.120
 differentiate complex video games and 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.140
 ambitious your basic video games and without 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.180
 depth 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.860
 from a semantic point of view we place 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.420
 same level the game that required 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.680
 four years of work and the last 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.090
 mobile bump 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.890
 yet the world of video has 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.260
 taken care to differentiate what was a 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.800
 movie a short film a video about 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.170
 Internet 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.239
 a report or a television show as well 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.010
 the cinema does not pay the drifts of the 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.879
 TV and we never hear that the 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.920
 cinema is bad 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.629
 there are only hat videos so 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.489
 we would have to invent several words for 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.290
 define the video game it's the only one 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.030
 way to give certain titles 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.159
 greater recognition and 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.930
 especially that would motivate publishers to 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.210
 increase the depth of their title 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.400
 because he would have the promise of seeing their 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.170
 named products differently so say 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.939
 that video game is an art has no 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.229
 meaning a language standpoint because 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.430
 video game is everything and nothing at all 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.710
 time it's a technology 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:30.150
 we have to find a new word for 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.530
 games that deserves to be dollar why 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.329
 some productions forsake the 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.220
 gameplay for the screenwriting side of the 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.340
 game and thus increase the similarities 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.170
 with cinema it's a very question 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.420
 interesting about a phenomenon that seems 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.040
 touch more and more from triple to in 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.630
 wanting to include stories in their 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.909
 game the game designers have 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.740
 naturally inspired by cinema by having 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.840
 mainly two methods 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.850
 what are cinematics and 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.560
 scripted sequences the problematic of 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.210
 game designer is therefore good dosing 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.369
 cinematics and sequences 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.170
 scripted to deepen the story and 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.880
 the background of the central characters 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.649
 hindered the gameplay on this 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.369
 use of scenes played two 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.369
 schools compete against each other 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:12.810
 the world is divided into two categories 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:14.550
 we have on one side the sts mythologies that 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.440
 think the same gameplay 8 has to 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.879
 create a story for them he does not have to 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.830
 there is no swan to play in 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:21.650
 video game because it implements a 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.519
 certain linearity that break 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.440
 interactivity and so him to 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.750
 immersion the narratology sts them 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.470
 forbid narrative techniques 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.760
 as a vector of 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.379
 the story in the video game 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.030
 he thinks these techniques need to be 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:35.370
 used to convey emotions 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.720
 for them, video games are first and foremost 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.610
 an interactive story and 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.150
 the player's involvement will be by 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.739
 the story 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.360
 so it's important to guide the 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.890
 player in this story leaves to 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.780
 to restrain some of his freedom 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.000
 in fact it's a point difference of 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.489
 view of what is or must be a game 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.230
 video for narratology sts the game 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.450
 it's all about telling a story 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.459
 while for the elected representative these are 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.120
 the rules of the game that are at the heart of 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.980
 experience 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.660
 if you feel that today 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.700
 games is getting closer and closer to the 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.860
 cinema is that the school of narratology 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.430
 is on represented in productions 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.430
 triple to 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.890
