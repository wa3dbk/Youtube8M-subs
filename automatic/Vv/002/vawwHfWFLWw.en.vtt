00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
fun lately and that's partly because of

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.179 
fun lately and that's partly because of
infected<00:02:00.270> i<00:02:00.329> play<00:02:00.570> maybe<00:02:01.229> four<00:02:01.710> or<00:02:01.740> five<00:02:01.920> games

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189

place<00:02:06.720> of<00:02:06.869> infected<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:07.500> i'd<00:02:08.280> probably<00:02:08.489> get

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
place of infected and i'd probably get

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.309 
place of infected and i'd probably get
some<00:02:08.879> gameplays<00:02:09.269> in<00:02:09.479> ground<00:02:09.720> war<00:02:09.899> so<00:02:10.110> i'd<00:02:10.200> be

description I might forget
ever<00:02:17.790> know<00:02:17.970> but<00:02:18.450> there's<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.780> first<00:02:18.990> Moab<00:02:19.200> I

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
ever know but there's the first Moab I

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.160 
ever know but there's the first Moab I
guess<00:02:20.130> I<00:02:20.310> wanted<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:20.849> get<00:02:20.970> two<00:02:21.180> more<00:02:21.720> abs<00:02:21.900> but<00:02:22.140> I

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
guess I wanted to get two more abs but I

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.740 
guess I wanted to get two more abs but I
got<00:02:22.709> a<00:02:22.739> 48<00:02:23.130> gunstreak<00:02:23.700> so<00:02:23.970> I<00:02:24.000> guess<00:02:24.300> I<00:02:24.480> should

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
got a 48 gunstreak so I guess I should

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.780 
got a 48 gunstreak so I guess I should
have<00:02:24.870> gotten<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.200> second<00:02:26.040> Moab<00:02:26.130> but<00:02:26.670> now<00:02:26.760> I

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
have gotten the second Moab but now I

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.640 
have gotten the second Moab but now I
think<00:02:27.150> about<00:02:27.239> it<00:02:27.450> I<00:02:27.540> wouldn't<00:02:27.720> got<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:27.870> 46<00:02:28.380> and

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
think about it I wouldn't got a 46 and

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.570 
think about it I wouldn't got a 46 and
there's<00:02:29.280> another<00:02:29.489> gameplay<00:02:29.760> I<00:02:30.030> got<00:02:30.300> a<00:02:30.330> 48

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
there's another gameplay I got a 48

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.760 
there's another gameplay I got a 48
maybe<00:02:32.580> more<00:02:32.849> I<00:02:32.880> I'm<00:02:33.480> not<00:02:33.690> sure<00:02:33.930> this<00:02:34.560> might<00:02:34.739> be

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
maybe more I I'm not sure this might be

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.890 
maybe more I I'm not sure this might be
48<00:02:35.280> but<00:02:35.760> there<00:02:35.880> was<00:02:35.970> one<00:02:36.000> game<00:02:36.270> i<00:02:36.420> got<00:02:36.569> fifty

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
48 but there was one game i got fifty

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.740 
48 but there was one game i got fifty
eight<00:02:37.290> kills<00:02:37.620> before<00:02:38.400> dying<00:02:38.640> but<00:02:38.940> maybe<00:02:39.569> i'll

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
eight kills before dying but maybe i'll

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.510 
eight kills before dying but maybe i'll
