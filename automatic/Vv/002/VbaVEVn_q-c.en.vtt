00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.910 
now you don't really need to do anything
I<00:01:48.990> recommend<00:01:49.470> putting<00:01:49.590> your<00:01:49.829> CPU<00:01:50.399> up<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:51.920> 333

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
I recommend putting your CPU up to 333

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.359 
I recommend putting your CPU up to 333
by<00:01:53.340> 166<00:01:54.180> for<00:01:54.450> game<00:01:54.770> just<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:55.890> this<00:01:56.009> runs<00:01:56.280> a

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
by 166 for game just so this runs a

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.069 
by 166 for game just so this runs a
little<00:01:56.460> bit<00:01:56.700> more<00:01:56.850> smoothly<00:01:57.210> but<00:01:57.689> this<00:01:57.899> is

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
little bit more smoothly but this is

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.020 
little bit more smoothly but this is
just<00:01:58.290> gonna<00:01:58.579> access<00:01:59.579> your<00:02:00.439> HDD<00:02:01.439> well<00:02:02.130> your<00:02:02.640> HDD

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030
