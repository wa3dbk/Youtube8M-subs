luckily<00:05:26.050> he<00:05:26.230> didn't<00:05:26.500> get<00:05:26.620> the<00:05:26.740> stats<00:05:26.980> race<00:05:27.340> and

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
luckily he didn't get the stats race and

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:33.530 
luckily he didn't get the stats race and
rockslide<00:05:28.780> does<00:05:28.960> not<00:05:29.140> KO<00:05:30.690> sao<00:05:31.690> lai<00:05:31.840> the<00:05:31.900> salon

rockslide does not KO sao lai the salon

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.270 
rockslide does not KO sao lai the salon
so<00:05:34.540> he's<00:05:35.230> probably<00:05:35.410> going<00:05:35.710> to<00:05:35.800> fully<00:05:36.130> restore

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280
