00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.580
 we started then with the first 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.769
 semicircular and jessie vargas 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.879
 they fought for the title that will leave 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.689
 vacant 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:20.750
 one of the 147 pounds always something happens 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:22.610
 in the target center what I was looking for 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.820
 happen is that fran after changing 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:28.910
 your diet after working more on 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.239
 general power then boot missions 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.250
 to 110 images that left a lot to be desired 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.500
 beyond they already come walking in 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.510
 retracements then in braille which led 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.100
 the singing voice in this combat the 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.559
 first four rounds were something 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.620
 closed but then it always started to 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:48.920
 take control as a country this hand that 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.410
 exposes to stumble momentarily to 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.469
 a 10 and several who never got hurt 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:57.800
 it must be said if in this combat the 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:00.350
 duel was a battle that in the 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.940
 12th round with 21 seconds 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.270
 still on the clock 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.340
 this blow put in serious problems 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:11.420
 until the rally of the fourth 6 seconds still 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.730
 the referee case intervenes says that the 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.980
 combat is over 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:19.790
 He mistook warning 10 seconds 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:22.700
 by the final bell and it's there where 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:26.450
 the controversy arrives, my way of thinking is 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.730
 I think that in the end he won 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.250
 deservedly temporary on the cards 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.590
 because he dominated fully but also 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.740
 It must be said that he deserved the 36 minutes 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.180
 complete and I'm going to win if 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.400
 eric now be angry they should 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.350
 be angry because that did not show up 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.810
 jessie vargas up to the twelfth 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.480
 until two months reminds me of what 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.910
 that happened precisely he concentrated on 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.250
 contradiction by now they are locked 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.950
 what he did very little and now with only one 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.090
 blow was not going to solve the king of the 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.590
 vallenato 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.980
 it seems to me that when we think that its 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.050
 race had run out on Thursday 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:05.300
 he works is a spectacular boxer in 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.510
 television even and for the public 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.340
 and they would also ask and with respect 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.270
 to that arnaldo polemic I think there's 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.920
 what to change 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.320
 the seasonal ones have to look for the 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.100
 way in which it can be clearer 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:24.720
 the sound so it can not be confused 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:30.770
 actually being immoral and I do not know 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.770
 full was not a complete fight two 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.070
 Korea 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:46.800
 that had a sound and I had no other 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:49.140
 bell for a total mess the 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.000
 boxers have to know and just 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.740
 also know when in the fight 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.990
 they are but the clearest and most precise way 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.970
 completely agree and he told you that 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.340
 the commission of cali with is studying 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.770
 use a buzzer of those that you 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.290
 they listen to the spray sound so that 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.750
 already know and there is no confusion and 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:10.350
 besides I was there in the sand and hill 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.790
 the noise was as big as when it happened 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.170
 when chÃ¡vez 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.900
 martÃ­nez wonder 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:20.080
 are these moments that the public 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.120
 raise and understand fernando but 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.030
 also in the end it's no excuse 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.800
 there is a mistake you do not have to 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.569
 I miss what I believe is that the referee 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.980
 true if we're better at this from 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:31.510
 traction has to be worried about 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.520
 the type of things the referee is man 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.140
 closest to boxers for me 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.090
 Pendex is concerned about the health of 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.100
 the boxers because they had 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.510
 come back again so to see if they are 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.739
 well the two pugilists the beings 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:46.780
 human and below the ring there is enough 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:49.660
 people who make money without doing anything that 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.860
 could help the referee carry the 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.290
 Boxers 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:56.040
 but take the famous count you walk 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.040
 account is difficult 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:12.959
 that also starts in the teeth there 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.959
 many 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:27.310
 in 2015 and we will see that by 2015 a 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:29.770
 year will finally win again 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.259
 in bali after a 2014 and without 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.220
 victory and ultimately wants the 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:35.320
 rematch 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.080
 vargas I do not think it will change much in 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.780
 them but the future is money for 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:44.320
 sow and for your promoter wine that 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:53.620
 follow is a good question I think that 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:55.570
 a weight fight all the candidates 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.630
 because it also does not have a clear rival 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:01.750
 for September 12 for the number 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.800
 what is going to be now is really happy I 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.930
 I do not think so 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.240
 do you think that style of you say that 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.860
 fran yeste but revolutionized that style 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.900
 that can be spectacular suddenly 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.599
 dramatic that is just like the blows 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.440
 who receives blows can hurt him 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:18.940
 It's very good, I do not think it's because 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.100
 when it's worth you here 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.290
 doing what you do not give him that 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.970
 naturally he is a counterpuncher a 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.470
 excellent technical boxer and when 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.330
 you have the technical boxers in the 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.790
 Quadrilateral is not given for a large 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.470
 combat and understood that getting out of their 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.820
 boxes to look for it is spoken of 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.070
 generate and position that although it is 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.230
 too big and would expose to be 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.990
 punished and severely injured the 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:43.200
 central and rivers against the rally this 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.820
 it would be a war although it is more 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.830
 he has also had many wars and he 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.960
 speak also of brut scouts is this way i 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.850
 would like because then he would give us a 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.650
 exact measurement of where he was reading and 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:57.040
 also where is the British fighter 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:58.810
 as for real conditions boxes and 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.000
 the truth is that with controversy or without 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:03.850
 controversy what managed to sow the end of 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.740
 week was to get a little closer to 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:07.720
 level ever reached him boast 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.670
 I was for the big boxing leagues 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.650
 after the fight duel commitment 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.970
 that he had with Juan de Marquez but his 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:15.370
 career figures and low 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:17.350
 unfortunately I hope you can stay 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:20.350
 at this level because it is not a fight not 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:21.129
 and besides you have to say this won with 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:23.259
 Justice 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:25.509
 the error was not yours and should not 

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:27.729
 carry the problem of others but 

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:29.979
 there always seems to be some controversy and 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:32.259
 Vargas has to sit down and talk with 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:35.139
 him and morals because he can not have the 

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:36.519
 stance between a fight is not going to 

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:39.929
 take anywhere does not have to 

00:06:36.519 --> 00:06:39.929
 throw punches and point
