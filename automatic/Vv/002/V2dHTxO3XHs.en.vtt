00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
so I just installed a bully dog GT on

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.709 
so I just installed a bully dog GT on
our<00:00:04.980> Ford<00:00:05.850> f250<00:00:06.750> and<00:00:06.990> to<00:00:07.259> know<00:00:07.410> five<00:00:07.680> six<00:00:07.710> liter

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:08.719 
our Ford f250 and to know five six liter

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:12.999 
our Ford f250 and to know five six liter
really<00:00:09.719> easy<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:10.110> install<00:00:10.670> this<00:00:11.670> little<00:00:11.880> gauge

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:13.009 
really easy to install this little gauge

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.910 
really easy to install this little gauge
pod<00:00:14.009> here<00:00:14.519> is<00:00:14.670> just<00:00:15.599> connected<00:00:16.470> up<00:00:16.590> to<00:00:16.800> the

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
pod here is just connected up to the

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.939 
pod here is just connected up to the
windshield<00:00:17.630> the<00:00:18.630> suction<00:00:19.289> cup<00:00:19.529> thing<00:00:19.770> on

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
windshield the suction cup thing on

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.310 
windshield the suction cup thing on
there<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.220> it<00:00:20.580> holds<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:21.359> well<00:00:21.570> you<00:00:21.840> can't<00:00:22.109> get

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
there and it holds so well you can't get

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.790 
there and it holds so well you can't get
it<00:00:22.410> loose<00:00:22.590> hardly<00:00:23.580> at<00:00:23.670> all<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:24.090> then<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:25.080> this

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
it loose hardly at all and then the this

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.880 
it loose hardly at all and then the this
tuner<00:00:26.990> just<00:00:27.990> plugs<00:00:28.260> into<00:00:28.529> your<00:00:28.710> obd2<00:00:29.670> port<00:00:30.890> so

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
tuner just plugs into your obd2 port so

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.760 
tuner just plugs into your obd2 port so
it's<00:00:32.040> really<00:00:32.279> easy<00:00:32.460> install<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:34.079> just<00:00:34.559> needed

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
it's really easy install I just needed

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.260 
it's really easy install I just needed
to<00:00:34.950> find<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.430> 12<00:00:36.030> volt<00:00:36.360> fuse<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.350> hook<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.620> into

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
to find a 12 volt fuse to hook it into

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.479 
to find a 12 volt fuse to hook it into
one<00:00:39.270> cable<00:00:39.510> goes<00:00:39.840> up<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.350> gauge<00:00:40.890> up<00:00:41.280> top

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
one cable goes up to the gauge up top

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.250 
one cable goes up to the gauge up top
and<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.000> other<00:00:42.030> cable<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:42.719> see<00:00:42.899> coming<00:00:43.110> off

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
and the other cable you see coming off

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.049 
and the other cable you see coming off
the<00:00:43.410> right<00:00:43.620> hand<00:00:43.649> side<00:00:44.070> goes<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.370> an<00:00:44.640> optional

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
the right hand side goes to an optional

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.380 
the right hand side goes to an optional
parameter<00:00:45.239> I<00:00:46.309> went<00:00:47.309> ahead<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.579> added<00:00:48.059> that

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
parameter I went ahead and added that

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.299 
parameter I went ahead and added that
pyrometer<00:00:49.050> on<00:00:49.200> this<00:00:49.410> thing<00:00:49.620> cuz<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:49.860> wanted<00:00:50.160> to

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
pyrometer on this thing cuz I wanted to

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.910 
pyrometer on this thing cuz I wanted to
make<00:00:50.579> sure<00:00:50.610> when<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.539> bump<00:00:51.899> up<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.260> performance

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
make sure when I bump up the performance

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.910 
make sure when I bump up the performance
that<00:00:53.219> I<00:00:53.250> wasn't<00:00:53.820> over<00:00:54.510> fueling<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.289> getting

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
that I wasn't over fueling and getting

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.170 
that I wasn't over fueling and getting
too<00:00:56.039> hot<00:00:56.510> so<00:00:57.949> really<00:00:58.949> easy<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.430> adjust<00:00:59.670> this

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
too hot so really easy to adjust this

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.080 
too hot so really easy to adjust this
thing<00:01:00.239> on<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:01.109> right<00:01:01.289> hand<00:01:01.620> side<00:01:01.739> I'm<00:01:02.579> set<00:01:02.969> at

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
thing on the right hand side I'm set at

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.179 
thing on the right hand side I'm set at
stock<00:01:03.480> performance<00:01:03.870> level<00:01:04.439> right<00:01:04.589> now<00:01:04.619> if<00:01:05.100> I

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
stock performance level right now if I

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.840 
stock performance level right now if I
hit<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.400> once<00:01:05.700> I'll<00:01:05.909> go<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.150> tow<00:01:06.479> economy<00:01:07.380> mode

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
hit it once I'll go to tow economy mode

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.030 
hit it once I'll go to tow economy mode
second<00:01:08.850> one<00:01:09.000> up<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.360> performance<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.170> then

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
second one up is performance and then

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.260 
second one up is performance and then
extreme<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.869> then<00:01:12.869> from<00:01:13.080> there<00:01:14.090> really<00:01:15.090> neat

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
extreme and then from there really neat

ahead<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.380> set<00:01:22.860> what<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:24.210> want<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:26.360> defueling

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
ahead and set what I want the defueling

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.560 
ahead and set what I want the defueling
I<00:01:27.780> can<00:01:28.590> set<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.950> defueling<00:01:30.950> so<00:01:31.950> if<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:33.210> hits<00:01:33.450> a

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
I can set the defueling so if it hits a

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.450 
I can set the defueling so if it hits a
certain<00:01:33.900> temperature<00:01:34.259> it'll<00:01:35.189> start

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
certain temperature it'll start

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.700 
certain temperature it'll start
defueling<00:01:35.909> automatically<00:01:36.900> without<00:01:37.530> you

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
defueling automatically without you

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.319 
defueling automatically without you
intervening<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.640> don't<00:01:38.790> have<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.090> sit<00:01:39.299> there

and watch it it'll defueling levels mine
set<00:01:45.990> at<00:01:46.020> 1250<00:01:46.829> right<00:01:47.040> now<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.549> it's<00:01:48.210> on<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:49.259> need

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
set at 1250 right now and it's on I need

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.670 
set at 1250 right now and it's on I need
to<00:01:49.979> actually<00:01:50.700> go<00:01:50.909> out<00:01:50.939> put<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.869> in<00:01:51.960> stock<00:01:52.290> mode

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
to actually go out put it in stock mode

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.980 
to actually go out put it in stock mode
and<00:01:53.040> put<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.520> hundred<00:01:53.909> percent<00:01:54.000> load<00:01:54.390> on<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.810> and

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
and put a hundred percent load on it and

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.700 
and put a hundred percent load on it and
see<00:01:55.710> what<00:01:56.490> my<00:01:56.670> maximum<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:57.899> then<00:01:58.290> adjust

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
see what my maximum is and then adjust

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.350 
see what my maximum is and then adjust
it<00:01:58.890> here<00:01:59.880> to<00:02:00.030> be<00:02:00.149> safe<00:02:00.799> but<00:02:01.799> super<00:02:02.520> super

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
it here to be safe but super super

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.810 
it here to be safe but super super
simple<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:04.619> really<00:02:05.159> cool<00:02:05.399> feature<00:02:05.640> that

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
simple and a really cool feature that

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.499 
simple and a really cool feature that
allows<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.840> defueling

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
allows you to defueling

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.860 
allows you to defueling
the<00:02:09.509> other<00:02:09.660> thing<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:10.050> can<00:02:10.550> do<00:02:11.550> on<00:02:11.580> this<00:02:12.000> is

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
the other thing you can do on this is

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.699 
the other thing you can do on this is
is<00:02:12.930> come<00:02:13.470> in<00:02:13.620> here<00:02:13.890> on<00:02:14.040> your<00:02:14.220> gauges<00:02:14.519> and

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
is come in here on your gauges and

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.530 
is come in here on your gauges and
determine<00:02:16.709> which<00:02:16.980> gauge<00:02:17.549> you<00:02:17.879> want<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.209> put

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
determine which gauge you want to put

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.610 
determine which gauge you want to put
there<00:02:18.750> so<00:02:19.080> I've<00:02:19.230> got<00:02:20.629> coolant<00:02:21.629> on<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:22.200> second

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
there so I've got coolant on the second

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.479 
there so I've got coolant on the second
one<00:02:22.799> maybe<00:02:23.640> I<00:02:23.760> want<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.209> see<00:02:24.709> RPM<00:02:25.709> instead<00:02:25.980> or

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
one maybe I want to see RPM instead or

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.860
