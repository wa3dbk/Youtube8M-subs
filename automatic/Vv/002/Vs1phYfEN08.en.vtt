the clock when I was at work and I was

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.090 
the clock when I was at work and I was
like<00:01:51.149> oh<00:01:51.329> yeah<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:51.750> should<00:01:52.140> probably<00:01:52.530> take<00:01:52.950> my

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
doing say that's the best sensitivity

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.370 
doing say that's the best sensitivity
you've<00:03:30.790> probably<00:03:31.209> heard<00:03:31.389> that<00:03:31.569> before<00:03:31.720> but<00:03:31.959> it

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
you've probably heard that before but it

you know it bears repeating so see

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.580 
you know it bears repeating so see
control<00:03:37.329> setup<00:03:37.540> I<00:03:37.720> think<00:03:38.049> that's<00:03:38.200> about<00:03:38.290> it<00:03:38.440> I

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
control setup I think that's about it I

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.140 
control setup I think that's about it I
doubt<00:03:39.040> any<00:03:39.220> of<00:03:39.250> you<00:03:39.340> guys<00:03:39.459> care<00:03:39.700> about<00:03:39.760> what<00:03:40.060> my
