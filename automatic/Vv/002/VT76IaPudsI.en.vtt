hi this is pressure Locker in this video
I'll<00:00:02.580> teach<00:00:02.730> you<00:00:02.909> a<00:00:02.939> math<00:00:03.179> trick<00:00:03.510> so<00:00:03.959> that<00:00:04.110> you

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
I'll teach you a math trick so that you

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.140 
I'll teach you a math trick so that you
can<00:00:04.350> multiply<00:00:04.770> any<00:00:04.920> number<00:00:05.130> by<00:00:05.430> eleven<00:00:06.000> in

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
can multiply any number by eleven in

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.169 
can multiply any number by eleven in
your<00:00:06.480> head<00:00:07.160> you<00:00:08.160> probably<00:00:08.519> already<00:00:08.730> know<00:00:08.970> how

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
your head you probably already know how

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.940 
your head you probably already know how
to<00:00:09.240> multiply<00:00:09.570> a<00:00:09.750> single<00:00:10.349> digit<00:00:10.650> number<00:00:10.920> by

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
to multiply a single digit number by

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.549 
to multiply a single digit number by
eleven<00:00:11.580> you<00:00:12.240> simply<00:00:12.599> write<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:13.019> number<00:00:13.320> two

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
eleven you simply write the number two

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.530 
eleven you simply write the number two
times<00:00:13.860> and<00:00:14.190> that's<00:00:14.700> how<00:00:14.910> you<00:00:14.969> multiply<00:00:15.179> the

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
times and that's how you multiply the

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.380 
times and that's how you multiply the
number<00:00:15.929> by<00:00:15.960> eleven<00:00:16.760> but<00:00:17.760> what<00:00:17.880> if<00:00:18.000> you<00:00:18.119> want<00:00:18.300> to

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
number by eleven but what if you want to

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.740 
number by eleven but what if you want to
multiply<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.869> two-digit<00:00:19.680> number<00:00:19.710> by<00:00:20.130> eleven

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750 
multiply a two-digit number by eleven

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.099 
multiply a two-digit number by eleven
the<00:00:21.750> trick<00:00:22.020> involves<00:00:22.590> three<00:00:22.949> steps<00:00:23.840> first<00:00:24.840> you

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
the trick involves three steps first you

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.670 
the trick involves three steps first you
copy<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.800> first<00:00:26.039> digit<00:00:26.430> of<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.609> number<00:00:26.730> the

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
copy the first digit of the number the

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.800 
copy the first digit of the number the
second<00:00:28.680> step<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.490> add<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:30.119> two<00:00:30.150> digits<00:00:30.720> of

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
second step is to add the two digits of

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.479 
second step is to add the two digits of
the<00:00:30.869> number<00:00:33.200> then<00:00:34.200> you<00:00:34.410> copy<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.800> last<00:00:35.130> digit

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
the number then you copy the last digit

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.270 
the number then you copy the last digit
of<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.670> number<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.180> that's<00:00:36.960> your<00:00:37.140> answer

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
of the number and that's your answer

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.020 
of the number and that's your answer
seventeen<00:00:38.280> times<00:00:38.550> eleven<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.110> 187<00:00:40.910> to<00:00:41.910> do

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
seventeen times eleven is 187 to do

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.420 
seventeen times eleven is 187 to do
twenty-six<00:00:42.629> times<00:00:42.809> eleven<00:00:43.320> we<00:00:43.829> first<00:00:44.160> copy

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
twenty-six times eleven we first copy

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.450 
twenty-six times eleven we first copy
over<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.850> first<00:00:45.180> digit<00:00:45.570> then<00:00:46.559> we<00:00:46.770> take<00:00:46.980> 2<00:00:47.190> plus

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
over the first digit then we take 2 plus

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.479 
over the first digit then we take 2 plus
6<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:47.940> 8<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.539> then<00:00:49.230> we<00:00:49.289> copy<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.950> last<00:00:50.070> digit

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
6 is 8 and then we copy the last digit

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.119 
6 is 8 and then we copy the last digit
of<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.610> number<00:00:53.090> to<00:00:54.090> do<00:00:54.210> 52<00:00:54.780> by<00:00:54.960> eleven<00:00:55.410> we<00:00:55.860> copy

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
of the number to do 52 by eleven we copy

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.760 
of the number to do 52 by eleven we copy
the<00:00:56.370> first<00:00:56.550> digit<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.120> number<00:00:57.210> five<00:00:57.770> then

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
the first digit of the number five then

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.830 
the first digit of the number five then
we<00:00:58.949> take<00:00:59.129> five<00:00:59.399> plus<00:00:59.699> two<00:00:59.969> as<00:01:00.239> our<00:01:00.390> next<00:01:00.600> number

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
we take five plus two as our next number

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.060 
we take five plus two as our next number
and<00:01:01.170> then<00:01:01.829> we<00:01:01.980> copy<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.489> last<00:01:02.699> digit<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.629> get

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
and then we copy the last digit to get

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.890 
and then we copy the last digit to get
572<00:01:07.369> 478<00:01:08.369> times<00:01:08.670> eleven<00:01:09.090> we<00:01:09.210> copy<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.720> first

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
572 478 times eleven we copy the first

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.530 
572 478 times eleven we copy the first
digit<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.350> number<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.860> get<00:01:10.979> seven<00:01:11.400> then<00:01:12.360> we

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
digit of the number to get seven then we

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.740 
digit of the number to get seven then we
need<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.840> do<00:01:12.960> seven<00:01:13.409> plus<00:01:13.650> eight<00:01:14.210> this<00:01:15.210> number

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
need to do seven plus eight this number

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.399 
need to do seven plus eight this number
is<00:01:15.930> 15<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:17.640> we<00:01:17.759> need<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.060> write<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.330> as<00:01:18.659> one<00:01:18.689> and

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
is 15 so we need to write it as one and

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.929 
is 15 so we need to write it as one and
five<00:01:21.350> we<00:01:22.350> then<00:01:22.560> copy<00:01:22.799> over<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.220> last<00:01:23.490> digit<00:01:23.880> of

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
five we then copy over the last digit of

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.480 
five we then copy over the last digit of
the<00:01:24.000> number<00:01:24.060> eight<00:01:24.799> now<00:01:25.799> we<00:01:25.860> need<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.310> take

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
the number eight now we need to take

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.840 
the number eight now we need to take
care<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.390> 1<00:01:27.829> by<00:01:28.829> carrying<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.369> over<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.759> the

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
care of the 1 by carrying it over to the

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.870 
care of the 1 by carrying it over to the
7<00:01:30.350> so<00:01:31.350> we're<00:01:31.470> going<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.710> delete<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.280> 7<00:01:32.670> and

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
7 so we're going to delete the 7 and

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.370 
7 so we're going to delete the 7 and
make<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.479> eight<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.759> that's<00:01:35.759> our<00:01:36.000> answer

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
make it eight and that's our answer

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.760 
make it eight and that's our answer
858<00:01:38.509> let's<00:01:39.509> do<00:01:39.689> another<00:01:39.780> example<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.409> carrying

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
858 let's do another example of carrying

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.090 
858 let's do another example of carrying
over<00:01:40.970> 49<00:01:41.970> times<00:01:42.390> eleven<00:01:42.840> we<00:01:43.470> copy<00:01:43.740> over<00:01:43.890> the

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
over 49 times eleven we copy over the

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.330 
over 49 times eleven we copy over the
four<00:01:44.810> then<00:01:45.810> we<00:01:45.990> do<00:01:46.140> four<00:01:46.470> plus<00:01:46.740> nine<00:01:46.950> is<00:01:47.220> 13<00:01:47.790> and

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
four then we do four plus nine is 13 and

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.149 
four then we do four plus nine is 13 and
finally<00:01:50.340> we<00:01:50.460> copy<00:01:50.700> over<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.060> nine<00:01:51.829> to<00:01:52.829> account

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
finally we copy over the nine to account

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.490 
finally we copy over the nine to account
for<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.490> carry<00:01:53.729> over<00:01:53.820> one<00:01:54.210> we<00:01:54.810> turn<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.229> 4

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
for the carry over one we turn the 4

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.899 
for the carry over one we turn the 4
into<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.920> five<00:01:58.310> let's<00:01:59.310> say<00:01:59.490> we<00:01:59.610> want<00:01:59.850> to

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
into a five let's say we want to

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.330 
into a five let's say we want to
multiply<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.659> three<00:02:01.049> digit<00:02:01.350> number<00:02:01.649> or<00:02:01.799> larger

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
multiply a three digit number or larger

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.030 
multiply a three digit number or larger
number<00:02:02.640> it's<00:02:03.329> exactly<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.930> same<00:02:04.170> steps<00:02:04.469> we're

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
number it's exactly the same steps we're

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.560 
number it's exactly the same steps we're
going<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.310> copy<00:02:05.520> over<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.909> first<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.420> last

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
going to copy over the first and last

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.809 
going to copy over the first and last
digit<00:02:07.020> numbers<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.590> we're<00:02:08.160> going<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.459> add<00:02:08.610> the

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
digit numbers and we're going to add the

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.589 
digit numbers and we're going to add the
numbers<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:09.360> are<00:02:09.420> in<00:02:09.509> between<00:02:10.580> so<00:02:11.580> for<00:02:11.790> 123

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
numbers that are in between so for 123

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.880 
numbers that are in between so for 123
times<00:02:12.900> 11<00:02:13.319> we

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
times 11 we

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.210 
times 11 we
copy<00:02:14.069> over<00:02:14.460> the<00:02:14.490> 1<00:02:15.020> then<00:02:16.020> we<00:02:16.230> take<00:02:16.470> one<00:02:16.920> plus

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
copy over the 1 then we take one plus

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.600 
copy over the 1 then we take one plus
two<00:02:17.520> as<00:02:17.760> our<00:02:18.000> next<00:02:18.300> digit<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:18.990> get<00:02:19.140> three<00:02:19.610> then

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
two as our next digit to get three then

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.440 
two as our next digit to get three then
we<00:02:20.790> take<00:02:21.000> 2<00:02:21.270> plus<00:02:21.569> 3<00:02:21.959> which<00:02:22.860> is<00:02:22.890> 5<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.580> finally

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
we take 2 plus 3 which is 5 and finally

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.150 
we take 2 plus 3 which is 5 and finally
we<00:02:24.810> copy<00:02:25.020> over<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.470> last<00:02:25.680> digit<00:02:27.860> we<00:02:28.860> could<00:02:29.040> do

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
we copy over the last digit we could do

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.110 
we copy over the last digit we could do
this<00:02:29.310> for<00:02:29.370> any<00:02:29.880> size<00:02:30.360> number<00:02:30.690> we<00:02:30.840> want<00:02:32.120> we

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
this for any size number we want we

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.880 
this for any size number we want we
first<00:02:33.420> copy<00:02:33.690> over<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.110> first<00:02:34.410> stage<00:02:34.620> of<00:02:34.770> the

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
first copy over the first stage of the

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.390 
first copy over the first stage of the
number<00:02:35.190> then<00:02:36.150> we<00:02:36.390> add<00:02:36.570> up<00:02:36.860> the<00:02:37.860> digits<00:02:37.890> that

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
number then we add up the digits that

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.880 
number then we add up the digits that
are<00:02:38.490> in<00:02:38.580> between<00:02:38.700> so<00:02:39.660> we<00:02:39.780> take<00:02:39.989> 1<00:02:40.200> plus<00:02:40.470> 5<00:02:40.680> to

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
are in between so we take 1 plus 5 to

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:47.390 
are in between so we take 1 plus 5 to
get<00:02:41.040> 6<00:02:41.480> 5<00:02:42.480> plus<00:02:42.810> 3<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:43.560> get<00:02:43.680> 8<00:02:44.150> 3<00:02:45.150> plus<00:02:45.390> 4<00:02:45.660> is<00:02:45.690> 7<00:02:46.400> 4

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
get 6 5 plus 3 to get 8 3 plus 4 is 7 4

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.330 
get 6 5 plus 3 to get 8 3 plus 4 is 7 4
plus<00:02:47.700> 2<00:02:47.940> is<00:02:47.970> 6<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:48.600> finally<00:02:49.320> we<00:02:49.709> copy<00:02:49.950> over<00:02:50.310> the

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
plus 2 is 6 and finally we copy over the

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.290 
plus 2 is 6 and finally we copy over the
last<00:02:50.580> digit

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.610 

here's<00:02:54.300> a<00:02:54.390> short<00:02:54.600> proof<00:02:54.900> of<00:02:55.080> why<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.290> trick

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
here's a short proof of why the trick

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.190 
here's a short proof of why the trick
works<00:02:55.860> when<00:02:56.580> we<00:02:56.790> multiply<00:02:57.209> a<00:02:57.239> number<00:02:57.420> by<00:02:57.600> 11

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
works when we multiply a number by 11

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.410 
works when we multiply a number by 11
that's<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.860> same<00:02:59.070> thing<00:02:59.340> as<00:02:59.489> multiplying<00:03:00.239> it

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
that's the same thing as multiplying it

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.699 
that's the same thing as multiplying it
by<00:03:00.450> 10<00:03:00.810> plus<00:03:01.709> 1<00:03:02.959> we<00:03:03.959> can<00:03:04.110> write<00:03:04.170> this<00:03:04.500> in

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
by 10 plus 1 we can write this in

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:12.710 
by 10 plus 1 we can write this in
another<00:03:05.010> way<00:03:05.280> as<00:03:07.070> ABCD<00:03:08.070> 0<00:03:08.580> plus<00:03:09.330> ABCD<00:03:11.510> now<00:03:12.510> it's

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
another way as ABCD 0 plus ABCD now it's

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.900 
another way as ABCD 0 plus ABCD now it's
very<00:03:12.959> easy<00:03:13.019> to<00:03:13.470> see<00:03:13.650> if<00:03:13.860> we<00:03:14.100> add<00:03:14.220> up<00:03:14.250> column<00:03:14.790> by

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
very easy to see if we add up column by

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.039 
very easy to see if we add up column by
column<00:03:15.120> that<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.930> result<00:03:16.260> is<00:03:16.440> a<00:03:16.800> a<00:03:17.180> plus<00:03:18.180> b<00:03:18.420> b

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
column that the result is a a plus b b

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.640 
column that the result is a a plus b b
plus<00:03:19.350> c<00:03:19.380> c<00:03:20.040> plus<00:03:20.310> d<00:03:20.519> and<00:03:20.670> d<00:03:21.049> which<00:03:22.049> is<00:03:22.260> exactly

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
plus c c plus d and d which is exactly

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.539 
plus c c plus d and d which is exactly
the<00:03:22.860> trick<00:03:23.100> we've<00:03:23.280> been<00:03:23.489> using<00:03:23.730> i<00:03:25.430> hope<00:03:26.430> you
