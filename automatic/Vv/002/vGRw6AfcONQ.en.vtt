tip and that's used for cleaning out the

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.190 
tip and that's used for cleaning out the
hole<00:00:37.880> and<00:00:38.120> applying<00:00:39.110> some<00:00:39.170> sealant<00:00:40.870> the<00:00:41.870> next

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 
hole and applying some sealant the next

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.430 
hole and applying some sealant the next
tool<00:00:42.410> has<00:00:43.340> got<00:00:43.579> a<00:00:43.610> little<00:00:43.880> eyelet<00:00:44.240> in<00:00:44.390> it<00:00:44.540> and

tool has got a little eyelet in it and

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.320 
tool has got a little eyelet in it and
that's<00:00:45.650> what<00:00:45.830> you<00:00:45.920> use<00:00:45.950> to<00:00:46.370> hold<00:00:46.670> the<00:00:46.820> plug<00:00:47.060> as

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:47.330 
that's what you use to hold the plug as

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:52.300 
that's what you use to hold the plug as
you<00:00:47.690> shove<00:00:47.930> it<00:00:47.960> into<00:00:48.320> the<00:00:48.470> tire<00:00:50.890> then<00:00:51.890> the<00:00:52.100> kits

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:52.310 
you shove it into the tire then the kits

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.990 
you shove it into the tire then the kits
come<00:00:52.550> with<00:00:52.610> plugs<00:00:53.330> and<00:00:54.340> some<00:00:55.340> lubricating

come with plugs and some lubricating

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.270 
come with plugs and some lubricating
sealant<00:00:56.450> so<00:00:56.690> that<00:00:57.320> way<00:00:57.410> it<00:00:57.560> helps<00:00:57.680> live<00:00:58.040> it<00:00:58.160> in

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
sealant so that way it helps live it in

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.940 
sealant so that way it helps live it in
and<00:00:58.550> seal<00:00:58.820> it<00:00:58.970> once<00:00:59.120> you're<00:00:59.270> done<00:00:59.420> and<00:00:59.950> now

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:00.950 
and seal it once you're done and now

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.040 
and seal it once you're done and now

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
this point we're now going to move to

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.760 
this point we're now going to move to
the<00:01:19.100> tire<00:01:19.310> and<00:01:19.580> show<00:01:20.240> you<00:01:20.300> how<00:01:20.630> to<00:01:20.690> repair<00:01:21.500> the

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
then shove it in the hole kind of has a

00:01:52.619 --> 00:02:16.350 
then shove it in the hole kind of has a
twisting<00:01:53.159> motion<00:01:53.189> as<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.700> go<00:01:53.819> down

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.450 

and<00:02:17.350> then<00:02:17.470> pull<00:02:17.710> it<00:02:17.800> back<00:02:17.830> out<00:02:20.340> I'm<00:02:21.340> gonna

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
and then pull it back out I'm gonna

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:27.090 
and then pull it back out I'm gonna
stick<00:02:21.730> a<00:02:21.760> little<00:02:22.000> bit<00:02:22.180> more<00:02:22.390> Lube<00:02:22.630> on<00:02:22.780> it<00:02:26.100> shove

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
stick a little bit more Lube on it shove

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.610 
stick a little bit more Lube on it shove
it<00:02:27.220> back<00:02:27.250> in<00:02:27.810> you're<00:02:28.810> gonna<00:02:28.900> do<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.260> twisting

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
it back in you're gonna do the twisting

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.360 
it back in you're gonna do the twisting
motion<00:02:29.770> back<00:02:30.130> down<00:02:30.310> again<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:32.220> then<00:02:33.220> I'm

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
motion back down again and then I'm

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:40.860 
motion back down again and then I'm
gonna<00:02:33.600> kind<00:02:34.600> of<00:02:34.630> work<00:02:34.780> it<00:02:34.930> like<00:02:35.020> a<00:02:35.080> saw<00:02:39.870> and

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
gonna kind of work it like a saw and

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.540 
gonna kind of work it like a saw and
what<00:02:41.050> this<00:02:41.170> does<00:02:41.440> is<00:02:41.650> it<00:02:41.770> cleans<00:02:41.980> out<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.280> hole

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
what this does is it cleans out the hole

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.130 
what this does is it cleans out the hole
so<00:02:43.510> you<00:02:43.540> get<00:02:43.720> a<00:02:43.750> better<00:02:43.990> seal<00:02:45.900> and<00:02:46.900> then<00:02:47.020> I'm

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
so you get a better seal and then I'm

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.520 
so you get a better seal and then I'm
just<00:02:47.290> going<00:02:47.440> to<00:02:47.500> leave<00:02:47.710> the<00:02:47.890> reamer<00:02:48.070> in<00:02:48.340> it

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
just going to leave the reamer in it

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.550 
just going to leave the reamer in it
while<00:02:50.530> we<00:02:50.740> put<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.490> plug<00:02:51.790> and<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:53.140> insulation

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
while we put the plug and the insulation

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.790 
while we put the plug and the insulation
plug<00:02:53.950> tool<00:02:57.209> and<00:02:58.209> now<00:02:58.450> a<00:02:58.480> tip<00:02:58.900> and<00:02:59.410> if<00:02:59.500> you<00:02:59.650> have

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
plug tool and now a tip and if you have

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
we have cut our plug in half just so we

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.320 
we have cut our plug in half just so we
get<00:03:30.220> more<00:03:30.340> use<00:03:30.550> out<00:03:30.730> of<00:03:30.790> them<00:03:33.060> but<00:03:34.060> you<00:03:34.150> want<00:03:34.300> to

the tread if not a little bit below the
treads<00:04:41.180> you<00:04:41.330> can<00:04:41.509> possibly<00:04:41.960> get

little bit more okay and then the next

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.100 
little bit more okay and then the next
step<00:05:04.940> is<00:05:05.940> you<00:05:06.150> want<00:05:06.360> to<00:05:06.419> going<00:05:06.599> to<00:05:06.660> check<00:05:06.990> your

tire pressure to make sure it's up to

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.350 
tire pressure to make sure it's up to
proper<00:05:10.410> pressure<00:05:10.620> and<00:05:11.030> then<00:05:12.030> you<00:05:12.120> want<00:05:12.300> to

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
proper pressure and then you want to

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.309 
proper pressure and then you want to
