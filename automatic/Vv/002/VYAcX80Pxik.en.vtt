00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.750 
and all these guys came here consciously
knowing<00:03:59.410> that<00:03:59.919> they<00:04:00.040> wanted<00:04:00.250> to<00:04:00.340> be<00:04:00.459> a<00:04:00.489> part<00:04:00.639> of

makes it easy you know for them to come

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.449 
makes it easy you know for them to come
in<00:04:04.540> and<00:04:04.870> just<00:04:05.560> do<00:04:05.709> whatever<00:04:05.889> it<00:04:06.129> takes<00:04:06.310> for<00:04:06.370> us

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
the energy and the building starts to

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.600 
the energy and the building starts to
build<00:04:50.120> the<00:04:50.780> defense<00:04:51.169> picks<00:04:51.409> up<00:04:51.650> and<00:04:51.919> all<00:04:52.460> these
