00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
take it underneath but we're also going

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.470 
take it underneath but we're also going
to<00:02:14.650> get<00:02:14.830> the<00:02:14.890> lower<00:02:15.220> lids<00:02:15.489> in<00:02:15.730> just<00:02:16.060> a<00:02:16.150> second

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
to get the lower lids in just a second

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.470 
to get the lower lids in just a second
so<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.380> last<00:02:17.590> step<00:02:17.799> for<00:02:18.010> shadows<00:02:18.610> is<00:02:18.910> to<00:02:19.150> go<00:02:19.330> in

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
so the last step for shadows is to go in

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.860 
so the last step for shadows is to go in
with<00:02:19.750> this<00:02:19.959> golden<00:02:20.620> bronze<00:02:20.950> by<00:02:21.370> Milani<00:02:21.870> if
