00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
with Justin Houston I don't know either

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.569 
with Justin Houston I don't know either
way<00:01:41.549> um<00:01:42.140> propex<00:01:43.140> aren't<00:01:43.439> doing<00:01:44.189> us<00:01:44.369> much<00:01:44.399> good

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
way um propex aren't doing us much good

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.730 
way um propex aren't doing us much good
right<00:01:44.909> now<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.600> figured<00:01:46.110> if<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.320> pro<00:01:46.500> bags

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
right now so I figured if the pro bags

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.499 
right now so I figured if the pro bags
are<00:01:46.890> really<00:01:47.100> bad<00:01:47.340> we<00:01:47.820> will<00:01:47.939> go<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.270> large

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
are really bad we will go to the large

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.850 
are really bad we will go to the large
quick<00:01:48.840> styles<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.290> see<00:01:49.439> that's<00:01:49.649> where<00:01:49.829> our

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
quick styles and see that's where our

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.130 
quick styles and see that's where our
lock<00:01:50.130> is<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:51.420> think<00:01:51.450> that's<00:01:51.840> what<00:01:51.930> we<00:01:52.020> have

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
lock is and I think that's what we have

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.899 
lock is and I think that's what we have
to<00:01:52.259> go<00:01:52.350> because<00:01:52.590> this<00:01:53.130> has<00:01:53.250> been<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.850> absolute

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
to go because this has been the absolute

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.520 
to go because this has been the absolute
crap<00:01:54.570> so<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:54.810> think<00:01:54.960> we're<00:01:55.049> gonna<00:01:55.140> open<00:01:55.290> up<00:01:55.380> like

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
crap so I think we're gonna open up like

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.200 
crap so I think we're gonna open up like
what<00:01:55.680> three<00:01:55.890> more<00:01:56.070> propex<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.670> then<00:01:56.759> go<00:01:57.149> to

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
what three more propex and then go to

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.209 
what three more propex and then go to
the<00:01:57.329> large<00:01:57.570> quick<00:01:57.869> cells<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.469> see<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:59.070> could

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
the large quick cells and see that could

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.190 
the large quick cells and see that could
be<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.399> saving<00:01:59.640> grace<00:01:59.820> for<00:02:00.180> this<00:02:00.600> video<00:02:00.869> here

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
be the saving grace for this video here

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.679 
be the saving grace for this video here
because<00:02:01.350> I'm<00:02:01.579> Jesus<00:02:02.579> propex<00:02:02.939> was<00:02:03.090> not<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.479> as

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
because I'm Jesus propex was not it as

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.600 
because I'm Jesus propex was not it as

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
the Brewers bats about it so large quick

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.089 
the Brewers bats about it so large quick
cells<00:02:47.450> maybe<00:02:47.629> he<00:02:47.840> had<00:02:47.930> at<00:02:48.019> least<00:02:48.109> one<00:02:48.349> 100k<00:02:49.040> to

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
cells maybe he had at least one 100k to

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.220 
cells maybe he had at least one 100k to
make<00:02:49.340> up<00:02:49.489> for<00:02:49.700> that<00:02:49.790> maybe<00:02:50.299> a<00:02:50.420> 1<00:02:50.660> mil<00:02:50.900> we<00:02:51.109> could

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
make up for that maybe a 1 mil we could

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.979 
make up for that maybe a 1 mil we could
buy<00:02:51.349> JJ<00:02:51.769> Watt<00:02:51.980> with<00:02:52.099> that<00:02:52.220> one<00:02:52.370> milli<00:02:52.640> you<00:02:52.790> know

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
buy JJ Watt with that one milli you know

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.199 
buy JJ Watt with that one milli you know
maybe<00:02:53.989> I'm<00:02:54.349> just<00:02:54.560> dreaming<00:02:54.799> 50k<00:02:55.640> on<00:02:55.819> the<00:02:55.970> first

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
maybe I'm just dreaming 50k on the first

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.809 
maybe I'm just dreaming 50k on the first
one<00:02:56.450> s<00:02:56.599> that's<00:02:56.959> good<00:02:57.290> we'll<00:02:57.769> take<00:02:57.950> that<00:02:58.159> I<00:02:58.430> mean

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
one s that's good we'll take that I mean

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.809 
one s that's good we'll take that I mean
normally<00:02:59.000> you<00:02:59.239> get<00:02:59.359> like<00:02:59.540> 2.5<00:03:00.200> k<00:03:00.500> so<00:03:00.829> um<00:03:01.099> which

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
normally you get like 2.5 k so um which

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:03.339 
normally you get like 2.5 k so um which
is<00:03:01.940> probably<00:03:02.150> gonna<00:03:02.359> get<00:03:02.510> the<00:03:02.599> next<00:03:02.810> two<00:03:02.959> so

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
is probably gonna get the next two so

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.170 
is probably gonna get the next two so
50k<00:03:03.799> out<00:03:03.950> the<00:03:04.099> first<00:03:04.310> one<00:03:04.519> will<00:03:04.700> definitely

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
50k out the first one will definitely

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.589 
50k out the first one will definitely
take<00:03:05.420> that's<00:03:05.720> good<00:03:06.079> the<00:03:06.560> second<00:03:07.040> one<00:03:07.190> 25k<00:03:08.180> all

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 
take that's good the second one 25k all

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.619 
take that's good the second one 25k all
right<00:03:08.959> I<00:03:09.230> can<00:03:09.890> rock<00:03:10.010> these<00:03:10.280> men<00:03:10.549> it's<00:03:10.790> not<00:03:10.909> 2.5

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
anything can happen we'll see maybe

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.349 
anything can happen we'll see maybe
250,000<00:03:18.980> 15k<00:03:19.970> I<00:03:20.560> like<00:03:21.560> the<00:03:21.889> set<00:03:22.190> I'm<00:03:22.940> pretty

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
250,000 15k I like the set I'm pretty

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:25.120 
250,000 15k I like the set I'm pretty
sure<00:03:23.480> definitely<00:03:23.780> I<00:03:24.019> just<00:03:24.260> think<00:03:24.380> about<00:03:24.440> 50k

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
sure definitely I just think about 50k

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.400 
sure definitely I just think about 50k
to<00:03:25.190> do<00:03:25.459> so<00:03:25.819> I<00:03:26.060> mean<00:03:26.540> we<00:03:26.660> didn't<00:03:27.139> make<00:03:27.230> it<00:03:27.260> out

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
to do so I mean we didn't make it out

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:28.869 
to do so I mean we didn't make it out
too<00:03:27.560> bad<00:03:27.739> there's<00:03:28.160> definitely<00:03:28.400> worse<00:03:28.579> things

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 
too bad there's definitely worse things

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:30.909 
too bad there's definitely worse things
yeah<00:03:29.120> those<00:03:29.450> large<00:03:29.629> quick<00:03:29.870> cells<00:03:30.109> so<00:03:30.440> I'm
