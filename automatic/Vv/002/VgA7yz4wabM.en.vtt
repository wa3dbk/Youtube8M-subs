00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
problems now whether or not they were

problems now whether or not they were
extorted<00:04:34.350> they<00:04:34.770> say<00:04:35.010> they<00:04:35.220> were<00:04:35.280> trying<00:04:35.669> to

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
extorted they say they were trying to

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.050 
extorted they say they were trying to
protect<00:04:35.970> their<00:04:36.330> workers<00:04:37.520> but<00:04:38.520> Chiquita<00:04:38.940> has

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
protect their workers but Chiquita has

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.600 
protect their workers but Chiquita has
not<00:04:39.240> been<00:04:39.510> known<00:04:39.750> for<00:04:40.380> really<00:04:40.650> carrying<00:04:41.400> all

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
not been known for really carrying all

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.010 
not been known for really carrying all
that<00:04:41.880> much<00:04:42.030> about<00:04:42.240> their<00:04:42.479> workers<00:04:42.840> they're

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
that much about their workers they're

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.409 
that much about their workers they're
famous<00:04:43.260> for<00:04:43.410> exploiting<00:04:43.979> workers<00:04:44.639> in<00:04:44.910> these

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
famous for exploiting workers in these

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.090 
famous for exploiting workers in these
fields<00:04:45.780> and<00:04:45.870> paying<00:04:46.169> them<00:04:46.380> low<00:04:46.650> wages<00:04:46.889> and

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
fields and paying them low wages and

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.590 
fields and paying them low wages and
giving<00:04:47.490> them<00:04:47.639> very<00:04:47.850> poor<00:04:48.120> working<00:04:48.479> conditions

giving them very poor working conditions

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.180 
giving them very poor working conditions
so<00:04:49.110> they<00:04:49.470> can't<00:04:49.650> really<00:04:49.860> say<00:04:50.010> they're

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
so they can't really say they're

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.770 
so they can't really say they're
carrying<00:04:50.520> all<00:04:50.729> that<00:04:50.760> much<00:04:51.150> about<00:04:51.510> their

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
carrying all that much about their

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.939 
carrying all that much about their
