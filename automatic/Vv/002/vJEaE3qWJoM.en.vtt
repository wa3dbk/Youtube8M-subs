Schumacher he was the guy that was set

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.040 
Schumacher he was the guy that was set
the<00:00:50.449> benchmark<00:00:50.900> and<00:00:51.050> really<00:00:51.760> was<00:00:53.050> difficult

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
the benchmark and really was difficult

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.689 
the benchmark and really was difficult
to<00:00:54.079> be<00:00:55.870> without<00:00:56.870> any<00:00:57.109> question<00:00:57.770> for<00:00:58.280> me<00:00:58.489> the

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
to be without any question for me the

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:00.160

because he is he attacks everything with
all<00:01:06.080> he's<00:01:06.229> got<00:01:06.259> and<00:01:06.770> I<00:01:07.700> don't<00:01:08.030> think<00:01:08.390> there's

00:01:08.529 --> 00:01:08.539 
all he's got and I don't think there's

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:10.419 
all he's got and I don't think there's
anyone<00:01:08.810> out<00:01:08.990> there<00:01:09.020> who's<00:01:09.560> quite<00:01:09.890> out<00:01:10.160> there

00:01:10.419 --> 00:01:10.429 
anyone out there who's quite out there

anyone out there who's quite out there
on<00:01:11.330> the<00:01:11.570> edge<00:01:11.720> quite<00:01:12.050> as<00:01:12.200> much<00:01:12.320> as<00:01:12.500> he<00:01:12.679> is<00:01:15.670> the

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
on the edge quite as much as he is the

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.580 
on the edge quite as much as he is the
most<00:01:16.850> exciting<00:01:17.420> car<00:01:17.630> I<00:01:17.660> think<00:01:17.899> I<00:01:17.990> drove<00:01:18.259> here

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
most exciting car I think I drove here

most exciting car I think I drove here
at<00:01:18.740> the<00:01:18.800> festival<00:01:19.130> of<00:01:19.190> speed<00:01:19.340> I<00:01:19.580> think<00:01:19.640> was<00:01:19.940> my

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
at the festival of speed I think was my

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.330 
at the festival of speed I think was my
active<00:01:20.450> Renault<00:01:20.899> Williams<00:01:21.350> which<00:01:21.710> I<00:01:21.740> hadn't

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
active Renault Williams which I hadn't

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.870 
active Renault Williams which I hadn't
driven<00:01:22.490> since<00:01:22.850> I<00:01:23.140> erased<00:01:24.140> it<00:01:24.320> and<00:01:24.610> it<00:01:25.610> still

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
driven since I erased it and it still

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:26.350 
driven since I erased it and it still
works

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
works

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.260 
works
they-they-they<00:01:27.770> but<00:01:28.520> it<00:01:28.610> had<00:01:28.700> a<00:01:28.729> very<00:01:29.030> very

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
they-they-they but it had a very very

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.090 
they-they-they but it had a very very
low<00:01:29.420> ground<00:01:29.750> clearance<00:01:30.020> so<00:01:30.380> it's<00:01:30.680> a<00:01:30.770> bit<00:01:30.920> bumpy

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
low ground clearance so it's a bit bumpy

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.469 
low ground clearance so it's a bit bumpy
up<00:01:31.400> here<00:01:31.579> and<00:01:31.700> it<00:01:31.759> was<00:01:31.850> a<00:01:31.880> bit<00:01:32.000> hairy<00:01:32.210> I<00:01:34.390> had<00:01:35.390> the

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
up here and it was a bit hairy I had the

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.330 
up here and it was a bit hairy I had the
choice<00:01:35.689> of<00:01:35.900> driving<00:01:36.320> any<00:01:36.530> car<00:01:36.860> up<00:01:37.100> the

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
choice of driving any car up the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.950 
choice of driving any car up the
Goodwood<00:01:37.790> Hill<00:01:38.030> Climb<00:01:38.210> it<00:01:38.420> probably<00:01:38.720> have<00:01:38.840> to

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
Goodwood Hill Climb it probably have to

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.480 
Goodwood Hill Climb it probably have to
be<00:01:39.079> my<00:01:39.110> williams-renault<00:01:40.570> 96<00:01:41.570> car<00:01:41.869> the<00:01:42.770> FW<00:01:43.189> 18

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
be my williams-renault 96 car the FW 18

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.550 
be my williams-renault 96 car the FW 18
and<00:01:43.840> because<00:01:44.840> I<00:01:45.079> won<00:01:45.229> the<00:01:45.350> world<00:01:45.470> championship

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
and because I won the world championship

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.310 
and because I won the world championship
in<00:01:46.189> it<00:01:46.340> and<00:01:46.490> it's<00:01:47.270> a<00:01:47.420> lovely<00:01:47.689> car

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320

but<00:02:21.640> I<00:02:21.670> think<00:02:22.420> in<00:02:22.510> all-in-all<00:02:22.900> it's<00:02:23.110> quite

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
but I think in all-in-all it's quite

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.470 
but I think in all-in-all it's quite
good<00:02:23.350> that<00:02:23.560> he<00:02:23.740> didn't<00:02:24.040> actually<00:02:24.270> take<00:02:25.270> up

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
good that he didn't actually take up

good that he didn't actually take up
formal<00:02:25.900> one<00:02:26.020> because<00:02:26.920> we<00:02:27.130> would<00:02:27.340> have<00:02:27.370> missed

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
formal one because we would have missed

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.040 
formal one because we would have missed
