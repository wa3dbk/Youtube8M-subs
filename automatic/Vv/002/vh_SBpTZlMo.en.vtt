I've never experimented with anything

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.600 
I've never experimented with anything

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
other than the corn syrup so I don't

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.750 
other than the corn syrup so I don't
know<00:01:32.700> how<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:33.060> would<00:01:33.210> turn<00:01:33.270> out<00:01:33.510> and<00:01:34.760> finally

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:35.760 
know how it would turn out and finally

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.970

I'm going to add some salt so we're just

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.880 
I'm going to add some salt so we're just
going<00:01:38.160> to<00:01:38.250> stir<00:01:38.460> this<00:01:38.490> in<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.530> bring<00:01:40.530> this<00:01:40.680> to

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890

a<00:01:40.920> boil

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.710

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
for it to come to a boil I was

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.620 
for it to come to a boil I was
constantly<00:01:53.470> stirring<00:01:53.980> now<00:01:54.850> that<00:01:55.450> it's

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
constantly stirring now that it's

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
looking so I'm drizzling this into my

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.580 
looking so I'm drizzling this into my
popcorn<00:02:58.750> that<00:02:59.380> I<00:02:59.410> pre-made<00:03:01.080> now<00:03:02.080> I<00:03:02.110> don't<00:03:02.410> have

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
popcorn that I pre-made now I don't have

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.009 
popcorn that I pre-made now I don't have
a<00:03:02.769> bowl<00:03:03.010> that<00:03:03.040> is<00:03:03.310> big<00:03:03.670> enough<00:03:03.700> to<00:03:04.239> house<00:03:04.540> all

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
a bowl that is big enough to house all

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.199 
a bowl that is big enough to house all
this<00:03:05.350> popcorn<00:03:05.980> so<00:03:06.190> I<00:03:06.220> split<00:03:06.670> it<00:03:06.790> up<00:03:06.880> into<00:03:07.030> two

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
this popcorn so I split it up into two

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.360 
this popcorn so I split it up into two
bowls<00:03:09.630> so<00:03:10.630> I'm<00:03:10.720> trying<00:03:11.590> to<00:03:11.709> be<00:03:11.800> as<00:03:11.920> even<00:03:12.250> as

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370

possible<00:03:12.940> here<00:03:13.090> but<00:03:13.239> I<00:03:13.269> think<00:03:13.510> there's<00:03:13.690> more

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
possible here but I think there's more

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.590 
possible here but I think there's more
in<00:03:14.320> this<00:03:14.650> bowl<00:03:14.920> than<00:03:15.160> any<00:03:15.340> other<00:03:15.550> so<00:03:15.940> I'm

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
in this bowl than any other so I'm

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.840 
in this bowl than any other so I'm
giving<00:03:16.810> it<00:03:16.959> a<00:03:17.050> little<00:03:17.170> bit<00:03:17.350> more<00:03:17.530> of<00:03:17.709> the<00:03:17.830> sauce

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.350 

now<00:03:21.850> I'm<00:03:21.970> just<00:03:22.090> going<00:03:22.180> to<00:03:22.300> stir<00:03:22.900> this<00:03:22.930> in<00:03:23.440> here

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
now I'm just going to stir this in here

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.850 
now I'm just going to stir this in here
if<00:03:25.360> you<00:03:25.480> want<00:03:25.720> to<00:03:25.840> leave<00:03:25.989> yourself<00:03:26.140> some<00:03:26.590> room

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
in the bowl to be able to stern that's

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.790 
in the bowl to be able to stern that's
exactly<00:03:30.280> why<00:03:30.760> I<00:03:30.790> didn't<00:03:31.269> try<00:03:32.140> and<00:03:32.320> jam

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800

that one's done I'm just going to
quickly<00:03:49.739> do<00:03:50.099> this<00:03:50.310> one<00:03:50.599> try<00:03:51.599> and<00:03:51.780> work<00:03:51.930> as<00:03:52.110> fast

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
quickly do this one try and work as fast

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:53.930
