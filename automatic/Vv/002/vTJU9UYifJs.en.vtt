00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
afternoon I knew I had an opponent to

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.570 
afternoon I knew I had an opponent to
play<00:03:47.200> against<00:03:47.680> and<00:03:47.860> I<00:03:47.980> think<00:03:48.190> this<00:03:48.250> is<00:03:48.310> with

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
play against and I think this is with

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.910 
play against and I think this is with
the<00:03:48.730> age<00:03:48.819> where<00:03:49.209> you<00:03:49.720> learn<00:03:49.989> and<00:03:50.470> obviously

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
the age where you learn and obviously

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.710 
the age where you learn and obviously
the<00:03:51.340> technique<00:03:51.849> and<00:03:52.030> the<00:03:52.120> stroke<00:03:52.420> is<00:03:52.599> so

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
the technique and the stroke is so

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.390 
the technique and the stroke is so
important<00:03:53.200> but<00:03:53.319> this<00:03:53.500> is<00:03:53.739> the<00:03:53.860> time<00:03:54.069> i<00:03:54.099> think

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
important but this is the time i think

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.100 
important but this is the time i think
when<00:03:54.519> you<00:03:54.640> really<00:03:54.940> develop<00:03:55.120> the<00:03:55.510> points<00:03:55.959> and

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
when you really develop the points and

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.150 
when you really develop the points and
learn<00:03:56.230> how<00:03:56.319> you're<00:03:56.560> going<00:03:56.680> to<00:03:56.769> play<00:03:56.980> as<00:03:57.130> a
