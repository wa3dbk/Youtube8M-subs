00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.940
 what happened 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:58.980
 I don't know if I'm there the light is that 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.230
 that on the teapot here from lamp of 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.940
 aladino this and this is the spy 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.330
 oil and therefore and must be changed 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.110
 the oil 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:13.039
 that's all it takes and then we go 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.039
 change this year from 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.170
 then let's see how it is 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.380
 check the good oil level 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.520
 I can do it by myself yes yes ok 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.600
 attention that the motor is not too much 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.120
 hot 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.170
 we can touched and just garden of 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.990
 temperature 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.930
 we invite the rod we clean it immediately 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.090
 see must remain between the minimum 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.020
 and the maximum 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:45.510
 rehn fine cleans re strili levi maximum 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.910
 may so mica are here is fine 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.280
 perfect so obviously I have to go to 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.740
 replace it but what little is inside 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.100
 we remove it we leave dentona we raise it 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.780
 all because the engine oil is for 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.600
 lubricate the mechanical parts e 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.580
 so you need new oil a little like the 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.380
 the lifeblood of the blood I make this 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:13.020
 what we go by the exact exact yes it is 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:15.000
 perfectly we are going to replace 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.360
 the oil and but first we don't take that off 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.490
 old 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.430
 absolutely yes ok we have to 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.860
 remember to put on gloves 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.500
 you're underestimating me and we 're doing this 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.290
 what here or the hot engine not hot 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.760
 but not even cold otherwise it does not flow 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.760
 good to keep 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.880
 but excuse me I almost stopped dripping 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.459
 we can change it meter and also new no 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.810
 no wait we have to change the first 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.730
 oil filter 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.530
 Oh God, what is the use of the filter? 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.020
 hold back impurities and let's go to 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.769
 change it every time we change 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:04.230
 the oil i use this type flow filter 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.640
 standard but it is the only filter that was there 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.120
 the motor was not even type of 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.100
 engine no of the petrol area of ​​the 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.560
 variator if there was one for mine 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.250
 brain we would be horse by change the 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.250
 we go we go 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.260
 we have replaced the oil filter 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:37.569
 just remembering to remove the 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.370
 gasket must remain in the engine 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.120
 dangerous and let's go and put the oil 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.159
 new 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.200
 no it's stopped i don't have a thing i don't know 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:46.510
 every time I change I am 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.720
 blessed oil look there is written on 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.340
 manual provided smart ok how much 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.180
 I want to put what's there instead 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.709
 written 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.530
 then there is also wrote the discussed ta 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:59.530
 let's choose this here at a castrol 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.030
 specific for scooters and it's perfect though 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.790
 is not that then thrown on the scale no 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.159
 no well we have the whole scale here ok 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.109
 perfect lawns I see so often 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:10.180
 so successful that I would go 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:13.530
 forward no baretto is so easy that it 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.530
 you can also do it there 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.930
 when it's done closing we do 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.699
 start engine for a minute 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.650
 are then we turn it off we leave it there a 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:31.430
 rest still minute and then we go to 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.430
 see level 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.750
 then we put the oil in the engine 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.240
 checking that the level is on the fore-end 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:51.539
 he was at the maximum attack but and I can 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.490
 abound in case not at most 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:55.110
 nevertheless no more then ok 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.699
 day is over I would say yes 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.889
 was a treasure 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:00.330
 thanks, however, we understand that they are not 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:02.310
 money if I do it in exchange for 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.900
 thank you I do this pious work 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.330
 I'm going to throw this in the beating that me 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:09.270
 I have no jokes but those who are poisonous 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.500
 I dispose of this cloth I ok because 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.080
 I think of you and if you had taken it 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.919
 supermarket anyone who sells it is kept 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.979
 dispose 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:18.780
 you are too far ahead so far 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:21.139
