it's kind of hard to watch him and tell
what<00:02:56.030> he's<00:02:56.120> doing<00:02:56.510> because<00:02:56.870> it<00:02:57.739> looks<00:02:58.099> like<00:02:58.340> my

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
what he's doing because it looks like my

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.759 
what he's doing because it looks like my

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:57.710 
intro and that's also kind of the base

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.100 
intro and that's also kind of the base
of<00:03:58.040> the<00:03:58.160> chorus<00:03:58.520> so<00:03:59.150> there's<00:03:59.330> not<00:03:59.450> much<00:03:59.510> to<00:03:59.720> the

this

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.330 

it's<00:04:33.419> what<00:04:33.599> that<00:04:33.810> is<00:04:34.050> that's<00:04:34.439> a<00:04:34.620> seaport<00:04:35.009> there

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
and you use that in other parts of the

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.110 
and you use that in other parts of the
song<00:04:37.139> but<00:04:37.620> I've<00:04:37.800> still<00:04:38.099> got<00:04:38.280> my<00:04:38.460> deal<00:04:38.729> going

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
song but I've still got my deal going

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.959

here<00:04:39.150> with<00:04:39.629> my<00:04:39.810> pinkie<00:04:40.259> and<00:04:40.439> meringue<00:04:41.250> on<00:04:41.639> the

00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:41.969 
here with my pinkie and meringue on the

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:43.429 
here with my pinkie and meringue on the
first<00:04:42.389> and<00:04:42.569> second<00:04:42.840> string<00:04:43.050> on<00:04:43.139> the<00:04:43.259> third

00:04:43.429 --> 00:04:43.439 
first and second string on the third

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:51.800 
first and second string on the third
fret<00:04:43.789> on<00:04:49.400> that<00:04:50.400> D<00:04:50.669> I'm<00:04:51.030> really<00:04:51.330> kind<00:04:51.599> of<00:04:51.689> just

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
fret on that D I'm really kind of just

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:58.070 
fret on that D I'm really kind of just
hitting<00:04:52.080> the<00:04:53.150> D<00:04:54.150> string<00:04:54.740> the<00:04:56.150> b<00:04:57.150> and<00:04:57.599> g<00:04:57.629> string

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
hitting the D string the b and g string

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.170 
hitting the D string the b and g string
so<00:04:58.439> it's<00:04:58.530> like<00:04:58.650> kind<00:04:58.830> of<00:04:58.889> act<00:04:59.310> like<00:04:59.490> a<00:05:02.060> and<00:05:03.060> on
