00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
the middle that's obviously gonna be

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:34.030 
the middle that's obviously gonna be
both<00:03:33.079> humbuckers<00:03:33.409> I'm<00:03:33.739> gonna<00:03:33.889> leave

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.740 
both humbuckers I'm gonna leave
everything<00:03:34.280> pretty<00:03:34.579> much<00:03:34.760> open<00:03:35.150> my<00:03:35.389> volumes

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
everything pretty much open my volumes

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.689 
everything pretty much open my volumes
all<00:03:35.959> the<00:03:36.049> way<00:03:36.169> up<00:03:36.290> and<00:03:36.500> my<00:03:37.129> tone<00:03:37.340> is<00:03:37.489> all<00:03:37.609> the

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:37.699 
all the way up and my tone is all the

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:39.849 
all the way up and my tone is all the
way<00:03:37.790> open<00:03:38.060> so<00:03:39.019> that<00:03:39.049> we<00:03:39.169> can<00:03:39.319> just<00:03:39.440> get<00:03:39.560> a<00:03:39.620> good

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:39.859 
way open so that we can just get a good

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:42.009 
way open so that we can just get a good
basic<00:03:40.730> feeling<00:03:41.449> how<00:03:41.540> it<00:03:41.659> is<00:03:41.750> when<00:03:41.900> you're

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
basic feeling how it is when you're

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:50.580 
basic feeling how it is when you're
playing<00:03:42.199> one<00:03:42.409> so<00:03:43.069> here's<00:03:43.639> the<00:03:43.760> middle

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.080 

just<00:03:51.590> real<00:03:51.769> straightforward<00:03:52.069> got<00:03:52.819> a<00:03:52.849> lot<00:03:53.060> of

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
just real straightforward got a lot of

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.229 
just real straightforward got a lot of
you<00:03:53.959> know<00:03:54.110> gonna<00:03:54.440> rebound<00:03:54.920> to<00:03:55.129> it<00:03:55.280> on<00:03:56.150> the

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
you know gonna rebound to it on the

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.140 
you know gonna rebound to it on the
strings<00:03:56.569> and<00:03:57.040> I<00:03:58.040> like<00:03:58.519> it<00:03:58.700> it's<00:03:58.790> just<00:03:58.879> a<00:03:59.000> good

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
strings and I like it it's just a good

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.059 
strings and I like it it's just a good
simple<00:03:59.480> rhythm<00:03:59.720> tone<00:03:59.900> and<00:04:00.709> now<00:04:00.799> we<00:04:00.860> can<00:04:01.010> go

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 
simple rhythm tone and now we can go

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:02.800 
simple rhythm tone and now we can go
into<00:04:01.250> the<00:04:01.370> bridge<00:04:01.580> play<00:04:02.090> the<00:04:02.209> same<00:04:02.330> thing

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
into the bridge play the same thing

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:10.210 
into the bridge play the same thing
everything's<00:04:03.290> pretty<00:04:03.379> much<00:04:03.530> open<00:04:03.890> right<00:04:04.040> here

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.470 

now<00:04:11.220> you<00:04:11.280> can<00:04:11.460> hear<00:04:11.640> when<00:04:11.790> the<00:04:11.940> in<00:04:12.330> this

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
now you can hear when the in this

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.120 
now you can hear when the in this
position<00:04:12.870> you<00:04:12.960> can<00:04:13.080> hear<00:04:13.230> when<00:04:13.380> the<00:04:13.470> SH<00:04:13.740> 50

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
position you can hear when the SH 50

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.300 
position you can hear when the SH 50
really<00:04:15.470> really<00:04:16.470> warms<00:04:16.709> up<00:04:16.920> you<00:04:17.010> can<00:04:17.100> hear<00:04:17.250> it

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
really really warms up you can hear it

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:27.930 
really really warms up you can hear it
right<00:04:17.340> now

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.800 

now<00:04:28.940> going<00:04:29.120> back<00:04:29.210> to<00:04:29.389> the<00:04:29.480> middle<00:04:29.720> position

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
now going back to the middle position

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.050 
now going back to the middle position
which<00:04:30.200> is<00:04:30.320> our<00:04:30.440> basic<00:04:30.620> you<00:04:31.490> know<00:04:31.610> position<00:04:32.000> we

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
which is our basic you know position we

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.120 
which is our basic you know position we
want<00:04:32.180> to<00:04:32.300> be<00:04:32.420> in<00:04:32.650> you<00:04:33.650> can<00:04:33.770> kind<00:04:33.950> of<00:04:33.980> hear<00:04:34.070> the

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
want to be in you can kind of hear the

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.410 
want to be in you can kind of hear the
difference<00:04:34.490> too<00:04:34.700> right<00:04:34.910> now<00:04:35.060> when<00:04:35.300> I'll

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:35.420 
difference too right now when I'll

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.150 
difference too right now when I'll
adjust<00:04:36.169> the<00:04:36.260> tone<00:04:36.470> control<00:04:36.830> it's<00:04:36.919> a<00:04:36.950> really

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
adjust the tone control it's a really

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.710 
adjust the tone control it's a really
sensitive<00:04:37.490> tone<00:04:37.760> control<00:04:38.090> which<00:04:38.240> is<00:04:38.270> nice<00:04:38.540> so

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
sensitive tone control which is nice so

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.230 
sensitive tone control which is nice so
you<00:04:38.810> don't<00:04:38.960> really<00:04:39.110> need<00:04:39.320> a<00:04:39.380> need<00:04:40.160> for<00:04:40.430> three

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
you don't really need a need for three

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.330 
you don't really need a need for three
or<00:04:41.360> four<00:04:41.570> switches<00:04:42.020> all<00:04:42.169> the<00:04:42.200> time<00:04:42.440> so<00:04:42.740> you'll

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
or four switches all the time so you'll

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.940 
or four switches all the time so you'll
hear<00:04:43.490> a<00:04:43.520> difference<00:04:43.910> as<00:04:44.090> I<00:04:44.150> play<00:04:44.630> through

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:54.269 

bullet<00:04:48.700> on<00:04:48.880> back

00:04:54.269 --> 00:04:54.279 

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:56.249 

so<00:04:54.849> it's<00:04:54.969> almost<00:04:55.089> like<00:04:55.269> a<00:04:55.359> cleaner<00:04:55.689> version

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:56.259 
so it's almost like a cleaner version

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:57.809 
so it's almost like a cleaner version
and<00:04:56.499> a<00:04:56.769> little<00:04:56.979> bit<00:04:57.069> softer<00:04:57.399> version<00:04:57.519> that

00:04:57.809 --> 00:04:57.819 
and a little bit softer version that

00:04:57.819 --> 00:04:59.279 
and a little bit softer version that
one's<00:04:57.969> that<00:04:58.059> what<00:04:58.389> we<00:04:58.509> did<00:04:58.629> in<00:04:58.779> just<00:04:58.989> the<00:04:59.109> neck

00:04:59.279 --> 00:04:59.289 
one's that what we did in just the neck

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:04.590 
one's that what we did in just the neck
position

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:10.840 

now<00:05:05.530> we'll<00:05:05.650> open<00:05:05.740> her<00:05:05.920> back<00:05:06.100> up<00:05:06.280> again

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.450 

the<00:05:11.750> versatility<00:05:12.320> of<00:05:12.650> the<00:05:12.770> guitar<00:05:13.070> is<00:05:13.100> pretty

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
the versatility of the guitar is pretty

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.030 
the versatility of the guitar is pretty
much<00:05:13.640> endless<00:05:13.940> between<00:05:14.450> your<00:05:14.690> your<00:05:15.590> pickups

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.040 
much endless between your your pickups

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:17.540 
switching and all the different controls

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.330 
switching and all the different controls
you<00:05:17.690> can<00:05:17.720> do<00:05:17.930> the<00:05:18.050> way<00:05:18.170> the<00:05:18.350> sensitivity<00:05:19.010> is<00:05:19.160> of

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
you can do the way the sensitivity is of

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.580 
you can do the way the sensitivity is of
this<00:05:19.400> guitar<00:05:19.790> so<00:05:20.030> it's<00:05:20.150> great<00:05:20.360> for<00:05:20.560> jazz<00:05:21.560> rock

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:39.910 
gonna split the pickup so that way it
sounds<00:05:38.180> like<00:05:38.420> a<00:05:38.450> single<00:05:38.720> coil<00:05:39.050> you<00:05:39.590> can<00:05:39.740> hear

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:39.920 
sounds like a single coil you can hear

00:05:39.920 --> 00:06:00.760 
sounds like a single coil you can hear
how<00:05:40.010> clean<00:05:40.280> that<00:05:40.310> sounds

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.050 

so<00:06:01.770> you<00:06:01.860> can<00:06:01.950> hear<00:06:02.130> it<00:06:02.190> kind<00:06:02.370> of<00:06:02.460> cleans<00:06:02.700> up<00:06:02.940> I

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
so you can hear it kind of cleans up I

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.460 
so you can hear it kind of cleans up I
mean<00:06:03.180> you<00:06:03.210> don't<00:06:03.330> have<00:06:03.510> that<00:06:03.720> big<00:06:03.960> like<00:06:04.170> Basie

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.470
