00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.190
 this contribution should now be the subject 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.960
 devote to stability 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.540
 especially what knees and knees 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.360
 HÃ¼ftgelenke concerns when we walk 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.910
 You also say that you are balancing 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.500
 on a wine the multiple of ours 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.510
 Body weight always on a wine 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.420
 speed it is very important that 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.430
 a certain stability is present in the 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.170
 Nails or hip joint if 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.269
 you want to avoid injury 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.769
 since we are in solid all day 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.590
 maybe even put footwear in 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.440
 high-heeled shoes is that 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.140
 counterproductive to the requirements 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.030
 the runner sideline our joints 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.270
 therefore I have a small one 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.480
 stability zirbel assembled this one 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.640
 consists of 1 both jumps from one 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.820
 static exercise on shaky 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.510
 underground and some squats 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.670
 with one forward and one side after 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.710
 behind back stretched leg and there itself 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.230
 a bit in terms of the balance 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.329
 challenge 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.519
 It is important that in the knee joint 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.250
 and the ankle is always trying the 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.680
 maximum movement to exploit some death 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.189
 I'll demonstrate that in a minute 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.330
 let's start I'm very happy 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:21.060
 three passes from these three exercises 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:24.570
 each ten of the apartment of the 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.229
 object then 30 to 40 seconds the 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:31.330
 keep practicing and three each 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:35.320
 squat to be three forward 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.190
 with the toy leg and just there 3 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.470
 by 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.240
 the demonstration I make less 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.070
 Repetition otherwise takes the whole 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.930
 easy to do that means here once 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.090
 jumps there it is important I do that 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.830
 also like barefoot around the foot 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.350
 continue to challenge and the 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.210
 out down 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.550
 this is really the jump in the 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.710
 knee joint cushioning that does not mean 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:00.070
 the stretched leg is not the summer 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.110
 the bothers cushioned the other foot 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.120
 not set off until you reach the 10th 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.270
 once in jumps on one side 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:11.260
 got through because it is three and 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.730
 four and a fifth , yes and yes 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.040
 of which every 10th 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.990
 perform overall then you shake 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.630
 a little bit both of them 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.970
 next is a i hold exercise and 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.910
 for that we are truly as deep as 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.410
 possible to go in the knee looks up 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.110
 the clock 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.030
 30 to 40 seconds keep on seeing her 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.490
 like my knee 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.510
 right and left is already rapid 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.239
 a little bit tired 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.519
 the muscles now I speak the 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:44.530
 but the muscles are very high as well 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:47.080
 of course the big muscles hold it 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.959
 30 to 40 seconds, the other at 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.519
 the two out a bit and again 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.310
 then come the one-time squats 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.980
 here again the maximum against Zambia 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:01.750
 get out of here for a while 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:07.450
 stretched deep, the whole thing is still 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:10.690
 here three times and around the one though 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.430
 little bit to shift the weight and 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.100
 then want to ask us 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:20.250
 different tribe club the leg to the side 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:23.620
 stretched yes, it makes you three times 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:28.420
 not exhausting because backwards 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:30.400
 stretch and three times deep ingenious 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.459
 You are allowed to dig out now 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:37.220
 see who can use can 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:39.170
 the page is yes 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.500
 and the whole thing on the other side 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:45.280
 3 and then you have good for yours 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.280
 have done
