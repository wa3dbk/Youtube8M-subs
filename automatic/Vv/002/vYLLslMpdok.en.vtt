00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.109
 But I think we'll make a 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.880
 Very modern makeup but a bit 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.070
 closed in this issue it will be a 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.349
 mix of gold with a little blue 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.239
 to give a broken type like that and 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.800
 really got into a kind of woman 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.210
 very stylish black 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.790
 now using this base and ht micron to 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.739
 puree I always like to apply the base 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.300
 first place with this who has he sky 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.300
 You can stay with sponge 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.610
 I think it gets the most perfect skin 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.890
 the more you pay with sponge 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.989
 adheres to the skin longer a layer of 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.640
 more natural skin whenever any 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:01.199
 product of the cup serves as the 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:04.129
 raw materials as a base as the corrective 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.129
 always shadow fixer 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:15.520
 so now with these people show you light 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.520
 bright with details in brasilia 

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:22.729
 usually it's dark brown and black 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:28.039
 eyebrows are much more queens 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:30.469
 so it 's always advisable to use a shadow 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:32.959
 for eyebrows I like more than 

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:36.829
 the piccola itself marked point 

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:40.939
 now with the golden shadow here can be 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:42.709
 a shadow can be a pigment something that 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:47.149
 be brighter 

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:51.560
 I'll apply the shadow on the brush and I'll 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:53.560
 shade all over the eyelid and 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:58.149
 that gives a little more peace of mind 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.149
 in the inner corners organized 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.360
 and now in the beautiful concave on the campus of 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.240
 extension look down and this I go 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.429
 to wear a purple shadow is a little over 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:13.050
 depth of the more colorful and 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:22.650
 it would be more summer after it deposits 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:23.940
 shade on the skin or foam that I will use 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.560
 this level 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.680
 always have the product in the brush 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:32.040
 This is the most interesting and civil 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:36.290
 new and ram ram it is a gray 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.290
 dark is a lead and he is wonderful 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.780
 then you become a councilor who is also a 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.100
 I'm the new winner of what I'm leaving here. 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.989
 in love with him 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:03:00.600
 I'll give you a hint type that I always 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:03:13.380
 I explain from the outside and from the corner 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:14.880
 internal first and now comes the key 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:19.829
 main benefactor this makeup 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:22.280
 modern it was to have a little repair 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.280
 thicker 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:33.050
 and with this map of and lining I will give a 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.270
 retouch over the blue just spend more 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.450
 marked because this proposal is 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.580
 competing pimples and I'll pass on the 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.700
 from within the cord to give more 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.700
 velocity 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.140
 This one is a blush, I prefer my 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.690
 number of a brightness and is exactly his 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.280
 is a mixed guava type salmon 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.690
 it has a super eliminator shine 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.800
 automation interests our super 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.800
 lit on her skin 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.570
 how many times have you been too afraid to use 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.350
 some kind of creamy shadow 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.680
 illuminator 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:09.520
 I always prefer to put the product on the 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.520
 hand chest 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:21.080
 spread with finger and then apply to skin 

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:23.150
 well in the middle is more concentrated and 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.110
 on the sides is spreading and will 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.590
 diluting 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:30.700
 So this is a trick I always 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.700
 apply faithfully always works 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:45.640
 fernanda staton which are milk with 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:45.640
