this<00:01:54.479> cyan<00:01:55.110> because<00:01:55.470> there's<00:01:55.650> some<00:01:55.799> science

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
this cyan because there's some science

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.340 
this cyan because there's some science
up<00:01:56.580> there<00:01:56.940> and<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.479> guess<00:01:57.720> there's<00:01:57.990> some<00:01:58.080> in

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
up there and I guess there's some in

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.910 
up there and I guess there's some in
that

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
that

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.270 
that
the<00:01:59.040> latter<00:01:59.520> parts<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.150> the<00:02:00.300> towel<00:02:00.570> too<00:02:01.190> so<00:02:02.190> you

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
the latter parts of the towel too so you

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.110 
the latter parts of the towel too so you
don't<00:02:02.310> want<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.580> take<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.880> too<00:02:03.060> far<00:02:04.700> or<00:02:05.700> you'll

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
don't want to take it too far or you'll

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.600 
don't want to take it too far or you'll
get<00:02:06.810> your<00:02:06.990> towel<00:02:07.229> maybe<00:02:07.830> darker<00:02:08.310> than<00:02:08.459> you

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
get your towel maybe darker than you

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.809 
get your towel maybe darker than you
want<00:02:08.850> it<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.179> be<00:02:10.009> okay<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.160> there's<00:02:11.340> not<00:02:11.580> any

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
want it to be okay and there's not any

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.490 
want it to be okay and there's not any
green<00:02:12.150> so<00:02:12.480> there's<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.750> little<00:02:12.930> bit<00:02:13.110> of<00:02:13.230> green

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
green so there's a little bit of green

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.310 
green so there's a little bit of green
in<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.800> water<00:02:14.520> out<00:02:14.940> there<00:02:15.240> you<00:02:15.390> can<00:02:15.510> see<00:02:15.840> if<00:02:15.990> we

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
in the water out there you can see if we

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.500 
in the water out there you can see if we
pull<00:02:16.560> it<00:02:16.680> all<00:02:16.950> out<00:02:17.190> you<00:02:17.430> see<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.700> water<00:02:18.030> change
