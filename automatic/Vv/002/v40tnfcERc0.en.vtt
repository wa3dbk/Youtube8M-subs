00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.170
 Hello, my name is Roman Chernyshov 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.170
 this is a guide on a system project 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:16.890
 would like to apologize for 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.259
 delay video tutorials and explain what 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.750
 was the reason not to go into 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:24.329
 I will show the details more clearly 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.020
 the reason for all this was here 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:29.939
 and the main reason for this is that 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.800
 on top of that i lost 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.260
 the sensitivity of the ring finger on 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.360
 left hand but hopefully soon 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.399
 time everything will be corrected and everything will be 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.289
 much better I would not want 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.379
 tell what exactly became 

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:45.300
 cause and how serious it is to 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.219
 once again not get in the comments from 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.839
 someone's diagnosis or possible 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.460
 the consequences though i'm not really 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:52.589
 impressionable person but in such 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.899
 moments are very difficult not to cheat yourself 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:56.819
 it really only looks 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.489
 scary enough actually i 

00:00:56.819 --> 00:01:01.319
 I think that you can fix everything I hope 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.019
 what exactly with your help I will take in 

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:06.060
 hands a guitar much faster and I would 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.800
 really did not want to lose in such 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.799
 difficult life moment 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.570
 audience, I'm sure that everyone 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.610
 there is something to see during my 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.220
 rehabilitation after all judging by the statistics 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.490
 not every subscriber looked 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.260
 every video is recorded by me and all that 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.760
 in fact for obvious reasons 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.690
 everyone has their own tastes and theirs 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.120
 preferences 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:30.450
 but I once again ask you to close 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.040
 eyes on style and performers because 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.610
 first of all we learn to play 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.290
 guitar 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.350
 but to comprehend everything and gain experience 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.030
 need to at least see the execution 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.800
 songs in a completely different style 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.530
 unusual for you and at best 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.990
 take and try to perform exactly 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.030
 same very good extra 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.950
 motivation for recovery will be your 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.960
 comments under the video they viewed on 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.210
 youtube in contact unfortunately not very 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.980
 convenient to view fresh comments 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.310
 and youtube he always tightens everything 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:01.410
 fresh and it will be easier for me to communicate with you 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.300
 and more pleasant to see your feedback 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.520
 absolutely any message will be me 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.780
 nice to get from you will just 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.909
 comments about what you saw 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.099
 video is this a message that i'm 

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:12.090
 somewhere made a mistake thereby you 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.580
 help others 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.470
 but I hope for your understanding and remember 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.629
 I do not throw the project continued 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.390
 sure to be from time to time 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:23.110
 there may be some video reports on 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.660
 how I'm recovering 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.350
 how it all happened but on this one 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.350
 bye everyone
