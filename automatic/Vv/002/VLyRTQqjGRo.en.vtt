00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.790
 small pot made to melt a

 bain-marie chocolate and butter once 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.700
 loose let cool briefly 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.930
 in my chat and I put the sugar 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:37.430
 now I combine the classic pinch eggs 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.200
 of salt and a lot with whips until 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:44.320
 keep a nice frothy cream e 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:47.180
 homogeneous in this recipe I will use the 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:51.450
 buttermilk or in German throw me there 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:55.090
 there is in English butter milk is a 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:58.329
 fermented milk which from sweets a 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.090
 softness in my opinion major in bolzano 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:03.400
 is quietly in the supermarket 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.430
 here together I sometimes find it as naturasÃ¬ 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.400
 and in any case you can replace it or with del 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.049
 simple milk or with yogurt or 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.040
 adding to the same amount of 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:17.650
 milk a generous teaspoon of juice 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.010
 of lemon and let stand aside 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:24.269
 for about 15 minutes so the milk 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:28.569
 career and we will have this buttermilk 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:32.650
 add to the egg and sugar mixture 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:35.079
 the sides cello precisely in this 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.829
 bowl combined cocoa with flour but 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:41.260
 nina was also the vanilla and baking powder 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:42.819
 now mix them well to have a 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.040
 homogeneous compound 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:47.650
 and then we will begin to sift it in 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:52.200
 rest of the mixture a little at a time 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:56.639
 trying to mix the various well 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.639
 flour to the rest of the mixture 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:07.240
 now at the best time I add the 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:09.730
 melted chocolate with butter for non 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:17.440
 let us miss nothing of the chocolate a 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:19.870
 scagliette or buttered and floured a 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.510
 24 cm diameter baking tray 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.520
 now the mixture is poured into the oven 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.060
 at 180 degrees for forty minutes 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.880
 about 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.320
 so that a stick is a toothpick 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.790
 stuck in the center of the cake not 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.790
 it will come out clean and dry 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.980
 I had a bag of chocolate aside 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:46.100
 dating back even to Easter 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:46.100
 so new new easter items
