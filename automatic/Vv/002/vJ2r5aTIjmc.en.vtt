00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.780 
asked me out what was the difference up
between<00:02:04.820> the<00:02:05.090> two<00:02:05.299> strand<00:02:05.690> twists<00:02:06.170> and<00:02:06.520> I'm<00:02:07.520> a

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
between the two strand twists and I'm a

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.059 
between the two strand twists and I'm a
one<00:02:08.119> strand<00:02:08.450> twist<00:02:08.810> or<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:09.319> two<00:02:09.530> strand<00:02:09.920> is

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
one strand twist or the two strand is

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:11.680 
one strand twist or the two strand is
when<00:02:10.250> you<00:02:10.340> just<00:02:10.489> take<00:02:10.700> two<00:02:10.940> pieces<00:02:11.150> of<00:02:11.299> hair

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
when you just take two pieces of hair

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.500 
when you just take two pieces of hair
and<00:02:12.290> you<00:02:12.650> wrap<00:02:12.860> them<00:02:12.980> around<00:02:13.099> each<00:02:13.490> other<00:02:13.760> but

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
and you wrap them around each other but

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.320 
and you wrap them around each other but
a<00:02:14.780> thing<00:02:15.080> with<00:02:15.290> that<00:02:15.470> it<00:02:15.740> takes<00:02:15.980> a<00:02:16.280> long<00:02:17.030> it

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
a thing with that it takes a long it

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.770 
a thing with that it takes a long it
takes<00:02:17.540> longer<00:02:17.780> for<00:02:17.959> it<00:02:18.170> to<00:02:18.260> start

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
takes longer for it to start

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.270 
takes longer for it to start
like<00:02:18.990> an<00:02:19.140> actual<00:02:19.319> dread<00:02:19.800> like<00:02:20.010> it's<00:02:20.160> gonna

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
like an actual dread like it's gonna

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.240 
like an actual dread like it's gonna
look<00:02:20.400> like<00:02:20.459> twistys<00:02:21.450> for<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:21.840> while<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.500> a

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
look like twistys for a while and a

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.070 
look like twistys for a while and a
single<00:02:23.700> strand<00:02:24.000> twist<00:02:24.420> which<00:02:24.660> is<00:02:24.750> basically

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
single strand twist which is basically

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.770 
single strand twist which is basically
the<00:02:25.260> comb<00:02:25.470> twist<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:26.069> it's<00:02:26.910> basically<00:02:27.540> this

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
the comb twist and it's basically this

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.100 
the comb twist and it's basically this
when<00:02:28.620> you<00:02:28.709> just<00:02:28.890> take<00:02:29.040> a<00:02:29.069> comb<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:30.110> sectioned

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
when you just take a comb and sectioned

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.780 
when you just take a comb and sectioned
off<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.380> parts<00:02:31.680> of<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.830> hair<00:02:32.069> that<00:02:32.280> I<00:02:32.520> and

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
off the parts of the hair that I and

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.850 
off the parts of the hair that I and
then<00:02:32.910> you<00:02:33.030> just<00:02:33.209> twist<00:02:33.420> it<00:02:33.630> so<00:02:33.840> I'm<00:02:34.650> dear

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
then you just twist it so I'm dear

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.260 
then you just twist it so I'm dear
that's<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.250> difference<00:02:35.459> between<00:02:35.640> a<00:02:35.940> one

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
that's the difference between a one

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.930 
that's the difference between a one
strand<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:36.989> two<00:02:37.200> strand<00:02:37.530> twist<00:02:37.890> if<00:02:38.670> i'm
