00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.450
 I have dogs because first of all 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.260
 all my life I have had one are my 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:19.050
 companies are my brothers 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.700
 they are always dependent on one in 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.230
 everything then I like to give that 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:26.340
 responsibility because they in return 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.500
 They give love are unconditional I like 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.720
 take them out for a walk is like from 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.000
 stressful going out to the park to walk with 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.490
 them after a day 's work 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.890
 study 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:41.950
 well I have three dogs right now 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:45.280
 It is a border calling that is two years old 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:48.580
 it's called jack or the second is bruno is 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:52.780
 a unique race has between 10 months and a 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:54.970
 year the third is a plowman and he 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.890
 we also found him he was abandoned 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.890
 and he is about 8 years old 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.730
 So here we fu caught him after 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.360
 see it again the first time and 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.700
 he was terrible he was malnourished and his 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.340
 health because it is not good anymore it has several 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.530
 diseases that are normal for a 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.360
 adult dog but let's say to him by 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.610
 the state of abandonment will have 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.100
 accelerated much more then to the giallo 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.280
 he likes to play with other dogs he likes 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.619
 rest likes not bother him 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.360
 that is nervous let's say a motorcycle passes 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.960
 very close to him and he was thought to be 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.880
 scares and sometimes barks if someone is 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.990
 about what he does not like but he stays 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.759
 still 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.850
 Having a dog is a responsibility 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:43.280
 for the whole life of the dog when they are 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.259
 young people can live a little longer on their own 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.930
 alone unlike when they are 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:51.649
 oldies one already has to walk to his a 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:54.049
 your peace I think a dog deserves that 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:57.229
 I respect that he too was with you 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:59.899
 all your life giving you all the best 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.759
 of yourself to the end you have to be 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.990
 with them always giving you health 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.990
 protection darling
