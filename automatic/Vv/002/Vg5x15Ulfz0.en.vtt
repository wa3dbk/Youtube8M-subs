00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.170
 I followed the sergeant-chef hakim 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.099
 mezoughi I'm 29 I'm five years old 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.450
 service and I am a sports coach

 3200 meters 10 minutes 30 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.889
 the specialty of sports coach 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.690
 is to standardize the level of 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.220
 each soldier it also consists of 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.630
 perfect each staff 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.210
 when we have reached this basic level 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.230
 to make it the best 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.050
 sports coach is first of all a 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.400
 pedagogue s is then an athlete like 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.990
 sports coach must be 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.910
 multidisciplinary much more than 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.470
 specialist 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.360
 I exercise an extra professional sport 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.880
 cross-country miscellaneous and half-bottom 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.870
 on track in the summer it can take me to 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.070
 perform 10 to 11 workouts 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.030
 weekly I was already training 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.320
 a lot before getting into the army 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.719
 well the taste of the effort I had already 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.190
 you are brought to the she retransmits all 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.989
 days because anyway 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.350
 it's one of the main nerves of our 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.760
 job 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.620
 when we are 37 kilos on the back and 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.210
 we walk 10 hours on patrol in 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.270
 afghanistan is going to taste the effort there 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.800
 better be educated to be 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.840
 fighters foremost and coaches 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.489
 sportsmen after the military there is a 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.840
 great part of adaptation and that's 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.460
 true when we get to the job we 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.170
 can see it quickly we sent for 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.220
 our first mission maybe as 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.020
 sports coach 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.280
 and then my second mission there I 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.930
 do as a bodyguard and when 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.740
 one is bodyguard is good there I can 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.390
 tell you that we are widely 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.040
 fighters foremost and he is 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.540
 important for a soldier to leave 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.110
 they train they train here 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.020
 all year 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.220
 he has ants in his legs and he 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.110
 in he wants to go there he wants to 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.409
 leave and show to show what he 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.290
 can do 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.430
 the risk we all have we all have one 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.799
 little bit in the corner of our head 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.689
 but hey it's an integral part of the 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.430
 craft so the enemy is clearly 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.780
 identified I would not hesitate because I 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.200
 trained for that and it's my job to 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.390
 seven cases my job the sports coach 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.100
 and is multicard makes pass enormously 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.079
 test to these military an exemption 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.420
 internships for children 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.460
 he's doing sports for families of 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.840
 military it is impossible to coach 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.549
 civilians like 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.079
 military people there are values 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.700
 we have in the army 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.290
 rigor cohesion and others 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.670
 values â€‹â€‹that are clearly distinct 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.200
 more diluted in the civilian 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.820
 we may have to pass patents 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.140
 of state at the same time that we exercise our 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.850
 profession that's why coach 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.909
 sporty that still offers some 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.100
 panel of 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:09.099
 in the eure in terms of reconversion or 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.200
 even career development I aspire in 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.730

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.049
 the coaching specialty 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.730
 really gives the feeling of being 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:20.140
 to be helpful and then to teach 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.310
 useful things to people because the
