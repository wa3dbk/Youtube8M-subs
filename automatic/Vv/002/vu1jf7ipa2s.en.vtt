symbol<00:00:48.059> I<00:00:48.770> think<00:00:49.770> its<00:00:49.950> end<00:00:50.219> but<00:00:51.260> okay<00:00:52.260> anyways

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
symbol I think its end but okay anyways

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.740 
symbol I think its end but okay anyways
if<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.340> are<00:00:53.399> running<00:00:53.579> android<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.600> you
