00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.180
 "Migraine ginger" 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.100
 Many successful herbal treatments start this way. 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.023
 Someone learns that a plant has been used 

00:00:14.023 --> 00:00:17.654
 from some ancient medical tradition, like gingival headache, 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.297
 and decides that once there are patients with headaches 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.632
 and since it is just some safe common condiment, 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.196
 advises one of his migraine patients to experience it. 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.639
 At the first signs of migraine 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.671
 the patient mixes a quarter teaspoon of ginger powder into a little water, 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.822
 drinking it and puffing in half an hour 

00:00:33.822 --> 00:00:35.420
 the migraine is gone. 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.580
 And acted every time, no side effects. 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.917
 This is called a case report, 

00:00:41.917 --> 00:00:44.566
 which is actually just a glorious anecdote, 

00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:47.388
 but reported cases play an important role 

00:00:47.388 --> 00:00:49.220
 in the history of medicine. 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.060
 AIDS has been detected by a series of reported cases. 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.397
 A young man enters a clinic in Los Angeles 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.600
 with a heavy case of thrush and the rest is a story. 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.440
 Uncommon Side Effects or Failed Medication Messages for Breast Pain, 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.960
 or billions of dollars blockbuster, Viagra. 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.028
 Cases reported may be the "lowest" or "weakest" form of evidence, 

00:01:11.028 --> 00:01:14.065
 but they are often the "first line of evidence". 

00:01:14.065 --> 00:01:15.380
 That's where everything starts. 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.820
 So a reported case like this is not useful in itself, 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.260
 but it can inspire researchers to explore it. 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.140
 The problem is who will fund it? 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.180
 The market for migraine drugs costs billions of dollars. 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.218
 A quarter teaspoon of ginger powder worth about 5 cents. 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.100
 So who would fund a study comparing ginger 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.818
 with the leading drug for migraine? 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.640
 Nobody ... 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.300
 ... until now. 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.837
 A double secret randomized controlled clinical trial, 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.200
 comparing efficacy for ginger with sumatripan, 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.345
 also known as Imitrex, one of the best-selling ones 

00:01:51.345 --> 00:01:53.058
 billions of dollars in the world 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.780
 for the treatment of migraine. 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.820
 They tried to use only one eighth teaspoon 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.300
 ginger powder compared to a significant dose of the drug. 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.200
 Both worked equally well, equally fast. 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.040
 Most people started with moderate or severe pain before, 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.590
 but after the drug or ginger 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.300
 were mild or painless. 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.536
 The same proportion of migraine sufferers reported that they were happy 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.156
 of the results anyway, 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.480
 and so, in my opinion, ginger wins, 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.439
 not only because it's a few billion dollars cheaper, 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.140
 but also because there is significantly less 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.460
 side effects in the gingerbread group. 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.325
 People taking medication report dizziness, sedative effects, 

00:02:33.325 --> 00:02:34.833
 dizziness and heartburn. 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.288
 The only thing reported in the gingerbread group is a stomach upset 

00:02:37.288 --> 00:02:38.960
 in about 1 in 25 people, 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.304
 although the intake of one whole tablespoon of ginger powder 

00:02:42.304 --> 00:02:44.484
 at once on an empty stomach 

00:02:44.484 --> 00:02:47.020
 can irritate the belly of everyone, 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.700
 just keep it in mind. 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.620
 If you stick to an eighth teaspoon, 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.300
 this is not only up to 3000 times cheaper than the drug, 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.460
 but you're less likely to find yourself reporting a case 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.720
 to someone who had a heart attack 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:09.580
 or died after taking the drug.
