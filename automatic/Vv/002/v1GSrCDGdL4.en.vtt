of like this we're starting to get some

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.219 
of like this we're starting to get some
decent<00:01:41.460> snows<00:01:42.000> up<00:01:42.299> in<00:01:42.450> this<00:01:42.540> area<00:01:42.750> here<00:01:43.110> but

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
decent snows up in this area here but

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.990 
decent snows up in this area here but
i'm<00:01:43.320> not<00:01:43.500> as<00:01:43.770> much<00:01:44.100> i<00:01:44.430> think<00:01:44.909> as<00:01:45.180> we<00:01:45.890> were

here but there are some problems that

we're seeing with the gfs that can bring

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.869 
we're seeing with the gfs that can bring
this<00:02:14.709> back<00:02:14.920> west<00:02:15.250> and<00:02:15.519> I'll<00:02:15.609> show<00:02:15.849> you

this back west and I'll show you

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:18.449 
this back west and I'll show you
something<00:02:16.359> here<00:02:16.390> this<00:02:17.109> is<00:02:17.349> 500<00:02:18.099> millibar

mind to this is just going to get you a

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.520 
mind to this is just going to get you a
little<00:02:24.760> bit<00:02:24.969> confused<00:02:25.450> here<00:02:25.569> but<00:02:26.170> if<00:02:26.409> you

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
little bit confused here but if you

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.319 
little bit confused here but if you
follow<00:02:26.769> these<00:02:26.980> lines<00:02:27.310> here<00:02:27.489> see<00:02:27.819> how<00:02:27.909> it<00:02:28.000> digs

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:28.329 
follow these lines here see how it digs

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:29.580 
follow these lines here see how it digs
here<00:02:28.569> like<00:02:28.719> this<00:02:28.900> this<00:02:29.109> is<00:02:29.170> actually<00:02:29.530> the

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
here like this this is actually the

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.160 
here like this this is actually the
trough<00:02:30.010> and<00:02:31.000> you<00:02:31.150> see<00:02:31.329> how<00:02:31.420> it<00:02:31.540> digs<00:02:31.780> out<00:02:31.930> like

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
trough and you see how it digs out like

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.890 
trough and you see how it digs out like
this<00:02:32.579> what<00:02:33.579> this<00:02:33.700> is<00:02:33.909> telling<00:02:34.030> me<00:02:34.269> is<00:02:34.569> this<00:02:34.840> is

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
this what this is telling me is this is

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.319 
this what this is telling me is this is
not<00:02:35.139> really<00:02:35.439> a<00:02:35.489> overly<00:02:36.489> impressive<00:02:36.849> digging

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:37.329 
not really a overly impressive digging

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:39.420 
not really a overly impressive digging
here<00:02:37.569> but<00:02:38.379> additionally<00:02:38.859> that<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.069> system<00:02:39.370> is

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
here but additionally that the system is

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.610 
here but additionally that the system is
phased<00:02:39.760> so<00:02:40.569> we<00:02:40.810> are<00:02:40.930> having<00:02:41.139> a<00:02:41.260> storm<00:02:41.500> as

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
phased so we are having a storm as

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.369 
phased so we are having a storm as
bombing<00:02:42.010> offshore<00:02:42.400> here<00:02:42.840> gfs<00:02:43.840> has<00:02:44.019> it's<00:02:44.260> in

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379 
bombing offshore here gfs has it's in

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:46.259 
bombing offshore here gfs has it's in
the<00:02:44.470> time<00:02:44.709> frame<00:02:44.739> way<00:02:45.189> out<00:02:45.400> here<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:46.030> we're

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
the time frame way out here and we're

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.119 
the time frame way out here and we're
thinking<00:02:46.720> that<00:02:46.750> it<00:02:47.049> should<00:02:47.079> be<00:02:47.319> based<00:02:47.739> on<00:02:47.919> way

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129 
thinking that it should be based on way

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:50.490 
thinking that it should be based on way
the<00:02:48.280> way<00:02:48.430> this<00:02:48.609> trough<00:02:48.849> axis<00:02:49.150> is<00:02:49.569> here<00:02:49.870> should

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
the way this trough axis is here should

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.289 
the way this trough axis is here should
be<00:02:50.530> right<00:02:50.919> here<00:02:51.220> on<00:02:51.430> the<00:02:51.579> eastern<00:02:51.970> side<00:02:52.180> of<00:02:52.239> the

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
be right here on the eastern side of the

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.449 
be right here on the eastern side of the
trough<00:02:52.629> but<00:02:52.840> closer<00:02:53.139> to<00:02:53.349> the<00:02:53.439> coast<00:02:53.709> not<00:02:54.189> way

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
trough but closer to the coast not way

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:55.890 
trough but closer to the coast not way
out<00:02:54.669> here<00:02:54.970> this<00:02:55.120> is<00:02:55.209> a<00:02:55.269> considerable

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
out here this is a considerable

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.929 
out here this is a considerable
difference<00:02:56.109> if<00:02:56.590> the<00:02:57.129> upper<00:02:57.370> air<00:02:57.489> pattern<00:02:57.819> is

00:02:57.929 --> 00:02:57.939 
difference if the upper air pattern is

00:02:57.939 --> 00:02:59.819 
difference if the upper air pattern is
correct<00:02:58.299> is<00:02:58.480> showing<00:02:58.719> ledge<00:02:58.870> on<00:02:59.049> the<00:02:59.169> gfs<00:02:59.590> and

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
correct is showing ledge on the gfs and

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:01.080 
correct is showing ledge on the gfs and
that<00:02:59.919> would<00:03:00.010> mean<00:03:00.189> more<00:03:00.400> snow<00:03:00.700> up<00:03:00.849> in<00:03:00.939> this

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
that would mean more snow up in this

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.690 
that would mean more snow up in this
area<00:03:01.299> here<00:03:01.750> then<00:03:02.230> is<00:03:02.530> being<00:03:03.099> depicted<00:03:03.340> on<00:03:03.609> the

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
area here then is being depicted on the

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.839 
area here then is being depicted on the
gfs<00:03:04.150> so<00:03:05.310> something's<00:03:06.310> not<00:03:06.430> matching<00:03:06.819> the

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
gfs so something's not matching the

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:08.250 
gfs so something's not matching the
surface<00:03:07.269> and<00:03:07.480> that's<00:03:07.629> something<00:03:07.810> I<00:03:07.959> want<00:03:08.109> to

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
surface and that's something I want to

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.759 
surface and that's something I want to
follow<00:03:09.219> over<00:03:09.669> the<00:03:09.760> next<00:03:10.030> 24<00:03:10.989> to<00:03:11.019> 48<00:03:11.290> hours<00:03:11.560> and

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
follow over the next 24 to 48 hours and

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.860 
follow over the next 24 to 48 hours and
see<00:03:12.099> what's<00:03:12.310> see<00:03:12.939> what's<00:03:13.150> up<00:03:13.329> and<00:03:13.510> see<00:03:13.659> what's

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
see what's see what's up and see what's

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.099 
see what's see what's up and see what's
down<00:03:14.079> here<00:03:14.409> because<00:03:14.729> you<00:03:15.729> know<00:03:15.879> the<00:03:16.389> European

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109 
down here because you know the European

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:18.809 
down here because you know the European
model<00:03:17.440> has<00:03:17.680> had<00:03:18.010> a<00:03:18.069> little<00:03:18.340> bit<00:03:18.489> different

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
model has had a little bit different

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.360 
model has had a little bit different
look<00:03:18.940> today<00:03:19.349> here's<00:03:20.349> the<00:03:20.409> overnight<00:03:20.859> run<00:03:21.099> here

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
look today here's the overnight run here

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.099 
look today here's the overnight run here
pretty<00:03:21.790> much<00:03:21.909> the<00:03:22.030> same<00:03:22.269> idea<00:03:22.690> with<00:03:22.900> this

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
pretty much the same idea with this

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:24.689 
pretty much the same idea with this
trough<00:03:23.709> here<00:03:23.829> again<00:03:24.190> we're<00:03:24.310> following<00:03:24.609> this

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:24.699 
trough here again we're following this

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:26.699 
trough here again we're following this
axis<00:03:25.090> of<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.239> trough<00:03:25.540> kind<00:03:26.199> of<00:03:26.290> digs<00:03:26.500> down

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
axis of the trough kind of digs down

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.589 
axis of the trough kind of digs down
like<00:03:26.949> this<00:03:27.189> and<00:03:27.519> see<00:03:27.879> how<00:03:27.909> it's<00:03:28.090> a<00:03:28.150> lot<00:03:28.359> it's

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 
like this and see how it's a lot it's

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:30.869 
like this and see how it's a lot it's
just<00:03:29.169> a<00:03:29.229> lot<00:03:29.409> flatter<00:03:29.739> of<00:03:30.069> a<00:03:30.159> flow<00:03:30.430> that<00:03:30.459> it<00:03:30.699> was

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:30.879 
just a lot flatter of a flow that it was

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:33.240 
just a lot flatter of a flow that it was
before<00:03:31.290> we're<00:03:32.290> looking<00:03:32.530> at<00:03:32.620> the<00:03:32.739> earlier<00:03:33.069> one

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
before we're looking at the earlier one

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.920 
before we're looking at the earlier one
that<00:03:33.400> had<00:03:33.519> that<00:03:33.669> big<00:03:33.909> bomb<00:03:34.180> of<00:03:34.389> a<00:03:34.510> storm<00:03:34.780> over

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
that had that big bomb of a storm over

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.170 
that had that big bomb of a storm over
here<00:03:35.049> drumming<00:03:35.590> tremendous<00:03:36.459> snowfall<00:03:36.909> over<00:03:37.150> a

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
here drumming tremendous snowfall over a

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.270 
here drumming tremendous snowfall over a
coverage<00:03:37.540> area<00:03:37.689> it<00:03:38.349> was<00:03:38.530> digging<00:03:38.889> down<00:03:39.040> like

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
coverage area it was digging down like

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.059 
coverage area it was digging down like
this<00:03:39.930> and<00:03:40.930> when<00:03:41.049> you<00:03:41.109> have<00:03:41.259> a<00:03:41.290> big<00:03:41.650> Elmo's<00:03:42.040> a

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
this and when you have a big Elmo's a

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:43.860 
this and when you have a big Elmo's a
v-shaped<00:03:42.729> like<00:03:42.970> that<00:03:43.150> you<00:03:43.269> have<00:03:43.359> a<00:03:43.389> big<00:03:43.659> that's

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
v-shaped like that you have a big that's

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.409 
v-shaped like that you have a big that's
able<00:03:44.139> to<00:03:44.290> dig<00:03:44.530> down<00:03:44.739> this<00:03:45.009> far<00:03:45.310> it's<00:03:46.150> able<00:03:46.389> to

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:46.419 
able to dig down this far it's able to

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:49.469 
able to dig down this far it's able to
amplify<00:03:46.659> and<00:03:47.319> just<00:03:47.590> go<00:03:47.739> over<00:03:47.979> go<00:03:48.849> on<00:03:49.030> undergo

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:49.479 
amplify and just go over go on undergo

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:51.659 
amplify and just go over go on undergo
what's<00:03:49.659> called<00:03:49.780> cyclogenesis<00:03:50.560> and<00:03:51.129> that's

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:51.669 
what's called cyclogenesis and that's

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:53.069 
what's called cyclogenesis and that's
what<00:03:51.819> the<00:03:51.879> European<00:03:52.269> model<00:03:52.540> did<00:03:52.750> and<00:03:52.900> had<00:03:53.049> a

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
what the European model did and had a

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:55.640 
what the European model did and had a
low<00:03:53.650> that<00:03:53.889> was<00:03:53.979> closer<00:03:54.250> to<00:03:54.400> the<00:03:55.030> coastline

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
low that was closer to the coastline

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.710 
low that was closer to the coastline
European<00:03:56.650> now<00:03:56.799> has<00:03:57.069> a<00:03:57.099> dap<00:03:57.459> dau<00:03:57.909> near<00:03:58.209> not<00:03:58.419> too

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
European now has a dap dau near not too

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.330 
European now has a dap dau near not too
much<00:03:58.930> further<00:03:59.290> south<00:03:59.620> east<00:03:59.919> but<00:04:00.129> it<00:04:00.220> is

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
much further south east but it is

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.599 
much further south east but it is
southeast<00:04:00.989> and<00:04:01.989> a<00:04:02.079> lot<00:04:02.229> quicker<00:04:02.439> and<00:04:02.829> begats

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
southeast and a lot quicker and begats

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:05.849 
southeast and a lot quicker and begats
because<00:04:03.939> of<00:04:04.060> this<00:04:04.180> that's<00:04:04.540> via<00:04:05.229> the<00:04:05.409> flatter

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:05.859 
because of this that's via the flatter

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:09.539 
because of this that's via the flatter
look<00:04:06.159> to<00:04:06.310> the<00:04:06.459> trough<00:04:07.329> here<00:04:08.099> the<00:04:09.099> trough<00:04:09.340> axis

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
look to the trough here the trough axis

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.759 
look to the trough here the trough axis
so<00:04:10.479> we<00:04:10.599> go<00:04:10.720> to<00:04:10.780> the<00:04:10.900> European<00:04:11.319> model<00:04:11.530> this<00:04:11.650> is

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
so we go to the European model this is

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.050 
so we go to the European model this is
actually<00:04:12.040> for<00:04:12.099> the<00:04:12.189> overnight<00:04:12.430> run<00:04:12.759> here

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
actually for the overnight run here

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.159 
actually for the overnight run here
again<00:04:13.900> same<00:04:14.139> ID<00:04:14.319> here<00:04:14.620> the<00:04:15.060> early<00:04:16.060> on<00:04:16.359> Thursday

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
again same ID here the early on Thursday

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:18.539 
again same ID here the early on Thursday
with<00:04:17.320> the<00:04:17.440> snow<00:04:17.620> showers<00:04:17.979> up<00:04:18.099> to<00:04:18.190> the<00:04:18.250> north<00:04:18.430> of

with the snow showers up to the north of
the<00:04:18.609> /<00:04:18.940> running<00:04:19.150> and<00:04:19.419> then<00:04:19.959> as<00:04:20.049> we<00:04:20.169> go<00:04:20.260> a<00:04:20.289> little

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:20.409 
the / running and then as we go a little

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:23.010 
the / running and then as we go a little
bit<00:04:20.590> further<00:04:20.769> here<00:04:21.310> here's<00:04:22.180> Thursday<00:04:22.630> evening

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
bit further here here's Thursday evening

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.280 
bit further here here's Thursday evening
snow<00:04:23.260> starting<00:04:23.620> to<00:04:23.680> move<00:04:23.770> in

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
snow starting to move in

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.440 
snow starting to move in
this<00:04:25.070> is<00:04:25.190> the<00:04:25.310> overnight<00:04:25.640> period<00:04:25.850> we<00:04:26.150> got<00:04:26.270> some

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
this is the overnight period we got some

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.840 
this is the overnight period we got some
moderate<00:04:26.810> snow<00:04:27.080> over<00:04:27.440> eastern<00:04:27.920> PA<00:04:28.070> New<00:04:28.430> Jersey

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
moderate snow over eastern PA New Jersey

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.700 
moderate snow over eastern PA New Jersey
maybe<00:04:29.030> some<00:04:29.270> heavy<00:04:29.450> snow<00:04:29.720> down<00:04:29.930> here<00:04:29.960> by<00:04:30.290> in

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
maybe some heavy snow down here by in

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.120 
maybe some heavy snow down here by in
South<00:04:31.010> Jersey<00:04:31.280> and<00:04:32.080> then<00:04:33.080> by<00:04:33.680> Friday<00:04:34.010> morning

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
South Jersey and then by Friday morning

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.800 
South Jersey and then by Friday morning
it's<00:04:34.520> already<00:04:34.730> moving<00:04:34.910> out<00:04:35.120> just<00:04:35.510> like<00:04:35.660> the

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
it's already moving out just like the

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.520 
it's already moving out just like the
GFS<00:04:36.290> hazard<00:04:36.680> so<00:04:37.120> gfs<00:04:38.120> and<00:04:38.480> the<00:04:38.840> European<00:04:39.230> model

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
GFS hazard so gfs and the European model

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.200 
GFS hazard so gfs and the European model
are<00:04:39.770> not<00:04:40.190> that<00:04:40.400> far<00:04:40.640> apart<00:04:40.760> right<00:04:41.180> now

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
are not that far apart right now

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.380 
are not that far apart right now
European<00:04:42.140> model<00:04:42.890> actually<00:04:43.040> caved<00:04:43.520> the<00:04:43.850> GFS

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
European model actually caved the GFS

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.200 
European model actually caved the GFS
idea<00:04:44.780> while<00:04:45.500> the<00:04:45.800> GFS<00:04:46.280> kind<00:04:46.550> of<00:04:46.610> trended<00:04:47.030> the

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
idea while the GFS kind of trended the

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.730 
idea while the GFS kind of trended the
other<00:04:47.360> direction<00:04:47.570> towards<00:04:48.260> it<00:04:48.410> so<00:04:48.440> they<00:04:48.560> kind

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
other direction towards it so they kind

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.740 
other direction towards it so they kind
of<00:04:48.800> met<00:04:48.980> in<00:04:49.100> the<00:04:49.160> middle<00:04:49.490> and<00:04:50.300> all<00:04:50.510> that's

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
of met in the middle and all that's

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.360 
of met in the middle and all that's
going<00:04:50.900> to<00:04:50.930> result<00:04:51.110> in<00:04:51.440> is<00:04:51.620> something<00:04:51.950> a<00:04:52.100> that

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
going to result in is something a that

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.530

across<00:04:53.960> this<00:04:54.230> area<00:04:54.590> here<00:04:54.970> so<00:04:55.970> not<00:04:56.180> a<00:04:56.210> major

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
across this area here so not a major

could<00:05:38.300> you<00:05:38.510> could<00:05:38.690> have<00:05:38.780> a<00:05:38.840> major<00:05:39.020> or

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 
could you could have a major or

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.230 
could you could have a major or
crippling<00:05:39.740> event<00:05:40.100> here<00:05:40.340> but<00:05:40.580> I<00:05:40.610> think<00:05:40.790> right

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
crippling event here but I think right

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.790

now based on the overnight guiding said

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.310 
now based on the overnight guiding said
I<00:05:42.830> would<00:05:42.980> looked<00:05:43.130> at<00:05:43.450> most<00:05:44.450> recently<00:05:44.900> we<00:05:45.020> could

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
I would looked at most recently we could

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.070 
I would looked at most recently we could
take<00:05:45.500> this<00:05:45.680> red<00:05:46.130> dotted<00:05:46.460> area<00:05:47.270> way<00:05:47.540> and<00:05:47.870> just

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 
take this red dotted area way and just

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.980 
take this red dotted area way and just
keep<00:05:48.230> the<00:05:48.380> base<00:05:48.560> map<00:05:48.860> and<00:05:49.100> it<00:05:49.160> would<00:05:49.250> be<00:05:49.280> okay

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 
keep the base map and it would be okay

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.300 
keep the base map and it would be okay
nothing<00:05:50.990> really<00:05:51.080> supports<00:05:51.680> this<00:05:51.800> idea<00:05:51.980> of

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
nothing really supports this idea of
