only lasts 224 days this is because it

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.780 
only lasts 224 days this is because it

ever<00:02:31.629> flown<00:02:31.959> by<00:02:32.379> it

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
ever flown by it

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.460 
ever flown by it
that<00:02:33.220> was<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.519> Voyager<00:02:34.000> 2<00:02:34.209> in<00:02:34.829> 1986

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
that was the Voyager 2 in 1986

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.330 
that was the Voyager 2 in 1986
Neptune

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
Neptune

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.270 
Neptune
gravity<00:02:41.300> on<00:02:41.330> Neptune<00:02:41.989> is<00:02:42.200> almost<00:02:42.470> exactly<00:02:42.980> the

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
gravity on Neptune is almost exactly the

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.850 
gravity on Neptune is almost exactly the
same<00:02:43.430> as<00:02:43.880> it<00:02:44.000> is<00:02:44.090> on<00:02:44.270> earth<00:02:44.410> but<00:02:45.410> if<00:02:45.500> you<00:02:45.590> tried

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
same as it is on earth but if you tried

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.860 
same as it is on earth but if you tried
to<00:02:46.040> stand<00:02:46.310> on<00:02:46.489> Neptune<00:02:46.970> you<00:02:47.209> would<00:02:47.330> sink<00:02:47.599> right

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
to stand on Neptune you would sink right

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.630 
to stand on Neptune you would sink right
to<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.140> center<00:02:48.440> because<00:02:48.739> it's<00:02:49.040> just<00:02:49.370> a<00:02:49.459> ball

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
to the center because it's just a ball

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.870 
to the center because it's just a ball
of<00:02:49.670> gas<00:02:50.090> and<00:02:50.450> ice<00:02:51.099> Neptune<00:02:52.099> does<00:02:52.370> have<00:02:52.610> some<00:02:52.849> of

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
of gas and ice Neptune does have some of

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.410 
of gas and ice Neptune does have some of
the<00:02:53.120> strongest<00:02:53.750> winds<00:02:54.110> in<00:02:54.380> the<00:02:54.530> solar<00:02:54.770> system

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
the strongest winds in the solar system

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.300 
the strongest winds in the solar system
they're<00:02:56.420> eight<00:02:56.720> times<00:02:57.200> stronger<00:02:57.830> than<00:02:58.099> the

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
they're eight times stronger than the

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.980 
they're eight times stronger than the
worst<00:02:58.640> hurricane<00:02:59.390> winds<00:02:59.690> on<00:02:59.959> earth

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
worst hurricane winds on earth

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.750 
worst hurricane winds on earth
Pluto

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.080 

on<00:03:05.989> Pluto<00:03:06.989> gravity<00:03:07.590> works<00:03:07.830> differently<00:03:08.489> so<00:03:09.060> a

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
on Pluto gravity works differently so a

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.929 
on Pluto gravity works differently so a
100<00:03:10.019> pound<00:03:10.290> person<00:03:10.650> would<00:03:11.040> only<00:03:11.069> weigh<00:03:11.519> six

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:11.939 
100 pound person would only weigh six

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:15.440 
100 pound person would only weigh six
point<00:03:12.269> seven<00:03:12.599> pounds<00:03:13.349> on<00:03:13.470> Pluto

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
point seven pounds on Pluto

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.290 
point seven pounds on Pluto
Pluto<00:03:16.230> is<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.380> smallest<00:03:16.830> and<00:03:17.160> iciest<00:03:17.760> planet

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
Pluto is the smallest and iciest planet

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.470 
Pluto is the smallest and iciest planet
in<00:03:18.390> our<00:03:18.510> solar<00:03:18.569> system<00:03:19.580> it's<00:03:20.580> actually<00:03:21.209> so

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
in our solar system it's actually so

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.710 
in our solar system it's actually so
small<00:03:21.930> that<00:03:22.290> in<00:03:22.520> 2006<00:03:23.520> it<00:03:23.730> got<00:03:23.940> demoted<00:03:24.330> and

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
small that in 2006 it got demoted and

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.830 
small that in 2006 it got demoted and
isn't<00:03:25.140> technically<00:03:25.860> a<00:03:26.099> planet<00:03:26.640> anymore

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.730 

it's<00:03:29.470> okay<00:03:29.890> Pluto<00:03:30.400> I'm<00:03:30.580> not<00:03:30.970> a<00:03:31.000> planet<00:03:31.390> either

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
it's okay Pluto I'm not a planet either

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.940 
it's okay Pluto I'm not a planet either
thanks<00:03:34.580> for<00:03:34.790> watching
