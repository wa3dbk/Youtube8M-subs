00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:09.389
 It's very good to have been was nice here. 

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:11.370
 in the tupi, the subject is not cool 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.679
 because the subject is cool but it 's cool 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.719
 you so a guy with this 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.430
 representativeness to comment on this 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.680
 the magazine score that the most 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.329
 country that talks about football 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.239
 brought an interview with the technician 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:26.640
 called lula pereira who is black and bruno 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:28.349
 Pereira says that in Brazil he does not 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.960
 gets jobs in big clubs 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.610
 because he is black and indeed at a 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.010
 research that shows that we do not have 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.870
 black technicians in charge of large 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.070
 clubs or cristóvão borges in the Basque 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.660
 An exception is you being a guy who 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.850
 to struggle in living in europe that people 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.309
 has a case of racism one after another 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.649
 unable to perceive anything in the 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.410
 Brazil of prejudice do you think it is 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.570
 possible and how is it possible for the 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.820
 people reverses this since most of the 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.739
 our players consists of 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.039
 black players and we can not 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.199
 have a great black technician in charge 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.670
 everything has its time, my friend, too. 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.820
 pronounced against the saints was mine. 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:13.439
 first black president then I have 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:18.600
 that giving time to time in Brazil makes a 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:21.570
 enormous evolution in several things to the 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.950
 same time the world is not beat the time 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.530
 of the world 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.799
 I think it's part of the world in history 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.479
 of the world brings this same thing 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.700
 place then I think patience 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:37.950
 education is the exchange of cultures in schools 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.890
 we invest in cosme years to do 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.020
 travel is also because child places 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.729
 Child to play together has never 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:50.430
 nothing ever seen child resemblance to being 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.770
 racist then neither to undermine to be racist 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.680
 The first thing that came to me here is a 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.740
 school that we do in the educational phase 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.670
 of the child as he had not seen then 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.180
 have the responsibility 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.580
 This is it , it 's good if it's expensive class. 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.319
 competent for me 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.550
 The first thing the program is looking at 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:14.200
 one month if you put a black one now 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.489
 pope wants to talk does not have to be or 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:22.090
 not because whatever it is to me 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:27.540
 we are all in this new world and has its 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.540
 people are competent in the right places
