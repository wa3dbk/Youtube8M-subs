00:01:46.280 --> 00:02:07.609 
it's a perfect way to get started
feeding<00:01:46.850> your<00:01:47.030> Coons<00:01:47.270> and<00:01:47.659> it's<00:01:47.899> really<00:01:48.080> cheap

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.900 

here<00:02:08.619> we<00:02:08.709> are<00:02:08.740> another<00:02:09.069> one<00:02:09.310> of<00:02:09.429> my<00:02:09.490> feeders

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
here we are another one of my feeders

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.870 
here we are another one of my feeders
and<00:02:10.230> this<00:02:11.230> is<00:02:11.380> basically<00:02:11.770> a<00:02:11.920> twenty<00:02:12.730> five

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
and this is basically a twenty five

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
and this is basically a twenty five
gallon<00:02:13.330> container<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:16.209> reason<00:02:16.480> I<00:02:16.510> use<00:02:16.750> these

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
gallon container the reason I use these

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.380 
gallon container the reason I use these
is<00:02:17.110> it<00:02:17.260> hard-to-reach<00:02:17.770> places<00:02:18.069> where<00:02:18.400> I<00:02:18.670> don't

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
is it hard-to-reach places where I don't

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.180 
is it hard-to-reach places where I don't
get<00:02:19.540> to<00:02:19.660> come<00:02:19.810> to<00:02:19.990> them<00:02:20.140> a<00:02:20.170> lot<00:02:20.290> because<00:02:20.980> they

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
get to come to them a lot because they

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.650 
get to come to them a lot because they
hold<00:02:21.340> a<00:02:21.459> lot<00:02:21.490> of<00:02:21.640> corn<00:02:21.970> and<00:02:22.270> if<00:02:22.360> you've<00:02:22.510> got

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
hold a lot of corn and if you've got

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.900 
hold a lot of corn and if you've got
heavy<00:02:22.900> Coons<00:02:23.260> coming<00:02:23.650> to<00:02:23.739> your<00:02:23.860> buckets<00:02:24.220> it's

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910
