00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:06.759
 Today I will tell you about transparency 

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:09.280
 oil paints first need to say 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:12.389
 that oil paints come in four 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.980
 transparency types transparent paints 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.700
 translucent body semi paints 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:21.130
 paint case paints transparent 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:29.380
 paint when applied to the surface even 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:31.920
 dense layer of translucent case 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:36.929
 paint when applied to the surface 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.929
 make this surface invisible 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.140
 transparent 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:55.890
 paints are diluted with thinners to 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:59.960
 states like watercolor of what 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.960
 can not be said about the body paint 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.420
 and would 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.870
 manufacturers oily paints tubes 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.560
 here are the marks that 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.960
 denote transparency or 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.320
 opacity here if you see here 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:29.040
 such a filled square it means 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.230
 that the paint is opaque cabinet if 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.479
 you see here is such an empty square 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:36.390
 not painted know that the paint 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.650
 completely transparent and if you see 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.440
 that's so half painted 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:45.479
 a square it indicates that the paint is either 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:47.009
 semi case or translucent necessary 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.400
 understand that if you mix 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:54.800
 transparent and opaque paint then 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:59.910
 batch you becomes translucent 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:02.509
 In general, the old masters usually led their 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:06.479
 work as follows they first 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:08.970
 painted in transparent colors the first layer 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.160
 this was done by the underpainting then they 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.590
 continued to work corps and semi 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:19.709
 body paint as if making a picture 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.930
 identifying the form and so on and completed 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:26.850
 they are already transparent at the top 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:32.670
 paints here is work thin transparent 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:34.920
 layer is called glaze here knowing here 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.459
 these are not tricky properties of paints once ok you 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.880
 already be able to roughly imagine 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.350
 how can you work? 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.900
