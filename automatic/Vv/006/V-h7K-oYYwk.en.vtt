00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.020
 In another video from our series 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.450
 we look at the Cromwell cruiser tank. 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.600
 Cromwell was ranked in service from 1942 to 1952. 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.190
 His crew consisted of five members 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.190
 and he had a 76 millimeter thick armor, 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.560
 which is quite decent for a cruiser tank of that period 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.470
 and also weighed about 27 and a half tons. 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.370
 The Cromwell cruiser tanks were mainly used 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.620
 7th Armored Brigade, better known as 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.730
 desert rats. 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.540
 At that time most of the British armored brigades 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.540
 took over the Shermans of America. 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.540
 You can see from Cromwell front 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.090
 how small this vehicle is. 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.420
 You can see clearly above me 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.610
 main armament 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.610
 and to my left you can see 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.870
 the first of two 7.92 mm machine guns. 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.200
 The first one is located here 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.650
 and the other is to the right of the cannon. 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.530
 Another thing you'll notice immediately in this tank 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.010
 is the size of the hatches. 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.360
 When we go inside 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.670
 you will see even better how small it is, 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.780
 Especially when you consider that there were 5 people in this tank. 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.010
 Driver's station 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.390
 is right behind me 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.620
 you can clearly see left and right 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:42.980
 episkopy. 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.030
 So now we're on the top of Cromwell, 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.590
 where i want you to take a picture of it 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.020
 how small this tank is. 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.130
 Compared to a lot of tanks you see, it's too small. 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.210
 If you look at the front of the tower 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.400
 You will see very well left, and right 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.400
 two episkops, or periscopes. 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.790
 The crew saw out quite badly 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.440
 when she was sitting inside with the hatch closed. 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.520
 Another thing I want you to notice 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.250
 is again the size of the hatches you will find at Cromwell 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.330
 Of course, like most tanks - there's a hatch for the chargers and also for the commander. 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.730
 And when you open one of these hatches, 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.050
 you can again see how little space is inside. 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.400
 On either side of the episkope or periscope 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.080
 we see that it has a very simple fan 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.010
 For venting gases after a cannon shot. 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.760
 Of course, many gases that arise 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.080
 when firing a main weapon, it is poisonous to the crew. 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.530
 How are we going towards the back of Cromwell 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.110
 Cromwell is very, very neatly designed here 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.830
 You see, it's not here on the back 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.830
 A lot of uselessness. 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.830
 Transmission area and engine 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.700
 was a 27-liter twelve-cylinder 600-horsepower engine 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.030
 and it was actually a modified version 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.030
 the same engine we find in Spitfire, 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.030
 modified Merlin engine. 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.340
 The Cromwell chassis is very simple 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.600
 as you can see, the chassis of Christie, 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.600
 Of course, without top support rollers 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.600
 and with five pairs of wheels, 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.970
 on each side. 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.620
 Each of these wheels, 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.890
 it is fixed with lock nuts. 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.490
 At the back of Cromwell, 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.610
 of course we have a driving wheel. 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.820
 Here we are in the Cromwell Tower. 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.120
 There is not much room, as you can see. 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.640
 A few things, important things worthy of attention. 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.270
 First, we can see, and in very good condition, 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:47.410
 original radio. 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.640
 This was wireless number 19. 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.060
 Down here, storage, 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.750
 which contained periscopes or optical prisms. 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:54.740
 If we keep going, 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.890
 you will see a number of storage bins 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.130
 in which there was ammunition 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.260
 one on the right front and on the one I'm sitting right now. 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.990
 The closing lever is located here. 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.860
 And here's the conclusion. 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.180
 Right to the left of the conclusion here 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.220
 you can see the butt of the machine gun. 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.700
 We have a headrest for the sight located below it. 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.360
 And just to the left of this you can see one of the periscopes 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.090
 and just below it you can see the tower's gearbox. 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.090
 Some of the controls 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.180
 The lever down here, 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.080
 is a very simplified version allowing you to turn right or left. 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.570
 And to the right of it you can see the elevation control wheel clearly.
