a<00:02:08.560> light<00:02:08.740> here<00:02:09.160> and<00:02:09.369> you<00:02:09.430> can<00:02:09.610> watch<00:02:09.880> the

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
a light here and you can watch the

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.839 
a light here and you can watch the
lighting<00:02:10.899> level<00:02:11.260> will<00:02:11.680> darken<00:02:12.040> and<00:02:12.430> then<00:02:12.700> it

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
lighting level will darken and then it

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.570 
lighting level will darken and then it
starts<00:02:13.180> to<00:02:13.269> brighten<00:02:13.780> up<00:02:13.900> again<00:02:14.260> so<00:02:14.590> it's<00:02:15.489> a

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
starts to brighten up again so it's a

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.390 
starts to brighten up again so it's a
little<00:02:15.760> strange<00:02:15.970> with<00:02:16.180> this<00:02:16.360> logitech<00:02:16.900> cam

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
it it's better than a camera which

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.259 
it it's better than a camera which
doesn't<00:02:28.950> have<00:02:29.069> those<00:02:29.250> automatic<00:02:29.730> light

let's talk about the cheap cheap webcam
that<00:02:36.030> I<00:02:36.060> showed<00:02:36.420> your<00:02:36.739> recorded<00:02:37.739> with<00:02:37.890> earlier

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
that I showed your recorded with earlier

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.020 
that I showed your recorded with earlier
and<00:02:38.700> here<00:02:39.329> it<00:02:39.420> is<00:02:39.450> and<00:02:39.959> at<00:02:40.859> first<00:02:41.220> glance<00:02:41.670> you

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
and here it is and at first glance you

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.589 
and here it is and at first glance you
might<00:02:42.329> go<00:02:42.599> wow<00:02:43.290> that's<00:02:43.980> one<00:02:44.370> of<00:02:44.599> Logitech's

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
might go wow that's one of Logitech's

might go wow that's one of Logitech's
best<00:02:45.959> webcams<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:47.280> ultra<00:02:47.819> vision<00:02:48.209> and<00:02:49.790> I'm

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
best webcams the ultra vision and I'm

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.039 
best webcams the ultra vision and I'm
going<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:51.000> be<00:02:51.090> rough<00:02:51.329> on<00:02:51.510> this<00:02:51.810> because

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
going to be rough on this because

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.080 
going to be rough on this because
basically<00:02:52.530> this<00:02:53.430> is<00:02:53.700> an<00:02:54.030> absolute<00:02:54.659> ripoff<00:02:55.319> of

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
basically this is an absolute ripoff of

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.410 
basically this is an absolute ripoff of
intellectual<00:02:57.090> property<00:02:57.680> in<00:02:58.730> design<00:02:59.730> elements

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
intellectual property in design elements

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.190 
intellectual property in design elements
so<00:03:00.750> that<00:03:00.780> this<00:03:01.170> looks<00:03:01.590> like<00:03:01.980> a<00:03:02.310> logitech

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
so that this looks like a logitech

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.080 
so that this looks like a logitech

problems I found with this is that when

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:53.059 
problems I found with this is that when
it<00:03:51.000> sets<00:03:51.239> on<00:03:51.389> a<00:03:51.419> monitor<00:03:51.810> it<00:03:52.470> has<00:03:52.680> a<00:03:52.709> tendency

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
to wobble and rock a little bit I don't

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.210
