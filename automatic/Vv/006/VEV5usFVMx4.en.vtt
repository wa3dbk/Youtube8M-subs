00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
which will mention in a little bit but

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.410 
which will mention in a little bit but
it's<00:01:24.619> more<00:01:24.830> about<00:01:24.979> bringing<00:01:25.490> the<00:01:25.729> top<00:01:26.000> quality

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
it's more about bringing the top quality

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.029 
it's more about bringing the top quality
content<00:01:26.840> that's<00:01:27.080> why<00:01:27.229> we<00:01:27.380> started<00:01:27.649> doing<00:01:27.770> top

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:28.039 
content that's why we started doing top

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:30.100 
content that's why we started doing top
fives<00:01:28.340> not<00:01:28.759> top<00:01:29.000> fives<00:01:29.270> and<00:01:29.479> some<00:01:29.660> parodies

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
fives not top fives and some parodies

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.410 
fives not top fives and some parodies
the<00:01:30.709> reason<00:01:31.099> we<00:01:31.190> did<00:01:31.369> that<00:01:31.399> is<00:01:31.580> to<00:01:31.940> test<00:01:32.179> it

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
the reason we did that is to test it

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.359 
the reason we did that is to test it
