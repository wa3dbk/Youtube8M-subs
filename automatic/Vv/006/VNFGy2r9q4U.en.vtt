it whatsoever and I felt the control arm

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.109 
it whatsoever and I felt the control arm
bushings<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.180> they<00:01:12.960> were<00:01:13.049> shot<00:01:13.880> so<00:01:14.880> it's<00:01:15.000> like

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
I'll buy some bushings for this side and

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.300 
I'll buy some bushings for this side and
do<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.890> same<00:01:20.159> thing<00:01:20.780> well<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:22.110> go<00:01:22.409> online<00:01:22.619> and

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
do the same thing well I go online and

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.039 
do the same thing well I go online and
it<00:01:23.610> turns<00:01:23.850> out<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.450> can't<00:01:24.689> just<00:01:24.930> buy

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
it turns out that you can't just buy

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.899 
it turns out that you can't just buy
bushings<00:01:25.500> for<00:01:25.590> these<00:01:25.830> control<00:01:26.400> arms<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:26.850> you

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
bushings for these control arms so you

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.390 
bushings for these control arms so you
have<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.210> buy<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.360> whole<00:01:27.600> control<00:01:27.990> arm<00:01:28.369> so<00:01:29.369> I

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
have to buy the whole control arm so I

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.730 
have to buy the whole control arm so I
replace<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.270> ball<00:01:30.420> joint<00:01:30.689> on<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.960> left<00:01:31.500> side

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
replace the ball joint on the left side

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.240 
replace the ball joint on the left side
or<00:01:32.220> driver's<00:01:32.640> side<00:01:33.049> for<00:01:34.049> nothing<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.650> I

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
or driver's side for nothing and I

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.530 
or driver's side for nothing and I
bought<00:01:35.460> one<00:01:35.520> for<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.939> other<00:01:36.060> side<00:01:36.329> for

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
bought one for the other side for

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.780 
bought one for the other side for
nothing<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:37.049> didn't<00:01:37.560> bother<00:01:38.009> replacing<00:01:38.700> it

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
nothing I didn't bother replacing it

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:39.800

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
because it's kind of pointless because

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.710 
because it's kind of pointless because
the<00:01:40.020> new<00:01:40.170> control<00:01:41.070> arms<00:01:41.430> come<00:01:41.700> with<00:01:41.880> brand<00:01:42.630> new

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720

ball<00:01:42.869> joints<00:01:43.200> on<00:01:43.320> them<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.540> sucks<00:01:45.540> the

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
ball joints on them so that sucks the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.609 
ball joints on them so that sucks the
ball<00:01:46.020> joints<00:01:46.350> were<00:01:46.439> fine<00:01:47.930> it<00:01:48.930> was<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.290> control

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
ball joints were fine it was the control

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.080 
ball joints were fine it was the control
arm<00:01:49.770> bushings<00:01:50.159> that<00:01:50.310> were<00:01:50.399> causing<00:01:50.790> all<00:01:50.909> my

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
arm bushings that were causing all my

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.429 
arm bushings that were causing all my
looseness<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.439> couldn't<00:01:52.740> find<00:01:54.170> and<00:01:55.170> that

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
looseness that I couldn't find and that

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.289 
looseness that I couldn't find and that
that<00:01:55.710> alone<00:01:56.040> wouldn't<00:01:56.430> be<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.579> big<00:01:56.820> deal<00:01:56.850> but

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
that alone wouldn't be a big deal but

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.569 
that alone wouldn't be a big deal but
what<00:01:57.450> really<00:01:57.689> chaps<00:01:58.140> my<00:01:58.350> ass<00:01:58.530> is<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.189> brought<00:01:59.430> it

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
what really chaps my ass is I brought it

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.060 
what really chaps my ass is I brought it
to<00:01:59.700> tires<00:01:59.909> plus<00:02:00.299> I<00:02:00.600> had<00:02:00.960> them<00:02:01.110> just<00:02:01.439> balance

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
to tires plus I had them just balance

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.770 
to tires plus I had them just balance
the<00:02:02.130> wheels<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.700> then<00:02:02.820> they<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.450> know<00:02:03.479> did<00:02:03.750> a

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
the wheels and then they you know did a

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.569 
the wheels and then they you know did a
free<00:02:04.049> little<00:02:04.380> courtesy<00:02:04.860> check<00:02:05.219> or<00:02:05.460> whatever

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
free little courtesy check or whatever

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.029 
free little courtesy check or whatever
and<00:02:06.390> they<00:02:06.540> told<00:02:06.780> me<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.560> know<00:02:07.649> your<00:02:07.890> ball

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
and they told me you know your ball

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.999 
and they told me you know your ball
joints<00:02:08.399> are<00:02:08.520> bad<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:09.000> I<00:02:09.330> thought<00:02:09.539> well<00:02:10.009> you

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
joints are bad and I thought well you

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.589 
joints are bad and I thought well you
know<00:02:11.069> maybe<00:02:11.310> I<00:02:11.430> just<00:02:11.489> missed<00:02:11.879> it<00:02:12.060> when<00:02:12.390> I<00:02:12.480> was

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
know maybe I just missed it when I was

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.880 
know maybe I just missed it when I was
looking<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.930> first<00:02:13.110> time<00:02:13.319> there<00:02:13.470> was<00:02:13.500> some

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
looking the first time there was some

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.440 
looking the first time there was some
sort<00:02:14.040> of<00:02:14.160> looseness<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.730> I<00:02:14.819> couldn't<00:02:15.150> seem<00:02:15.330> to

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
sort of looseness and I couldn't seem to

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.260 
sort of looseness and I couldn't seem to
pinpoint<00:02:15.690> it<00:02:16.110> in<00:02:16.739> the<00:02:16.890> garage<00:02:17.040> there<00:02:17.580> I<00:02:17.760> didn't

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
pinpoint it in the garage there I didn't

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.449 
pinpoint it in the garage there I didn't
look<00:02:18.360> real<00:02:18.540> hard<00:02:18.780> so<00:02:19.290> I<00:02:19.560> figured<00:02:20.069> yeah

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
look real hard so I figured yeah

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:21.770 
look real hard so I figured yeah
ball<00:02:20.640> joints<00:02:21.030> I'll<00:02:21.120> just<00:02:21.300> go<00:02:21.450> ahead<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:21.720> I'll

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
ball joints I'll just go ahead and I'll

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.170 
ball joints I'll just go ahead and I'll
replace<00:02:22.110> them<00:02:22.349> and<00:02:22.890> that'll<00:02:23.670> be<00:02:23.730> that<00:02:23.760> and

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
replace them and that'll be that and

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.240 
replace them and that'll be that and
I'll<00:02:24.540> be<00:02:24.660> good<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:24.840> go<00:02:24.959> but

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.980 

they<00:02:28.820> told<00:02:29.060> me<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.270> ball<00:02:29.420> joints<00:02:29.750> are<00:02:29.840> bad

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
they told me the ball joints are bad

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.530 
they told me the ball joints are bad
ball<00:02:30.260> joints<00:02:30.590> are<00:02:30.680> fine<00:02:30.890> and<00:02:31.370> that<00:02:32.000> you<00:02:32.390> know<00:02:32.480> I

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
ball joints are fine and that you know I

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.060 
ball joints are fine and that you know I
just<00:02:32.780> went<00:02:32.900> ahead<00:02:33.050> and<00:02:33.140> bottom<00:02:33.500> I<00:02:33.650> should<00:02:33.950> have

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
just went ahead and bottom I should have

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.010 
just went ahead and bottom I should have
I<00:02:34.310> should<00:02:34.550> have<00:02:34.850> checked<00:02:35.000> it<00:02:35.210> into<00:02:35.690> it<00:02:35.810> further

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
I should have checked it into it further

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.470 
I should have checked it into it further
but<00:02:36.320> I<00:02:36.380> didn't<00:02:36.710> but<00:02:37.700> that<00:02:37.730> just<00:02:37.970> pissed<00:02:38.240> me<00:02:38.450> off

rocket<00:03:17.360> science<00:03:17.690> and<00:03:17.780> they<00:03:17.930> couldn't<00:03:18.290> do<00:03:18.500> a

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
rocket science and they couldn't do a

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.620 
rocket science and they couldn't do a
single<00:03:18.860> one<00:03:19.100> right<00:03:19.310> so<00:03:19.670> I<00:03:19.910> had<00:03:20.300> to<00:03:20.360> take<00:03:20.510> all
