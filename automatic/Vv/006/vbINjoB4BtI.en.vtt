00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
spot welded to the inner tube there's

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.560 
spot welded to the inner tube there's
one<00:02:11.320> of<00:02:11.410> these<00:02:11.530> cans<00:02:11.830> on<00:02:12.070> each<00:02:12.100> end<00:02:12.550> and<00:02:12.790> then

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
one of these cans on each end and then

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.050 
one of these cans on each end and then
after<00:02:14.290> that<00:02:14.340> Harley<00:02:15.340> made<00:02:15.580> their<00:02:15.760> own<00:02:15.790> little

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
after that Harley made their own little

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.380 
after that Harley made their own little
fish<00:02:16.390> tail<00:02:16.890> crimped<00:02:17.890> it<00:02:17.980> on<00:02:18.130> welded<00:02:18.970> it<00:02:19.120> and

fish tail crimped it on welded it and

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.380 
fish tail crimped it on welded it and
then<00:02:20.110> welded<00:02:20.620> it<00:02:20.770> all<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.220> way<00:02:21.340> to<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:22.150> tip

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
then welded it all the way to the tip

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.550 
then welded it all the way to the tip
and<00:02:22.860> all<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:23.980> way<00:02:24.100> to<00:02:24.160> the<00:02:24.340> tip<00:02:24.550> on<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.850> bottom

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
and all the way to the tip on the bottom

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.920 
and all the way to the tip on the bottom
this<00:02:26.560> original<00:02:27.400> tip<00:02:27.670> is<00:02:27.880> kind<00:02:28.150> of<00:02:28.239> beat<00:02:28.420> up<00:02:28.450> but

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
this original tip is kind of beat up but

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.320 
this original tip is kind of beat up but
we<00:02:29.830> had<00:02:29.920> an<00:02:30.100> OS<00:02:30.340> one<00:02:30.580> when<00:02:30.760> we<00:02:30.790> were<00:02:30.940> making<00:02:31.239> our

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
we had an OS one when we were making our

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.720 
we had an OS one when we were making our
blueprints<00:02:31.900> and<00:02:32.050> we<00:02:32.739> got<00:02:32.860> everything<00:02:33.130> perfect

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
blueprints and we got everything perfect

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.430 
blueprints and we got everything perfect
so<00:02:33.940> you<00:02:34.300> can<00:02:34.450> see<00:02:34.630> the<00:02:34.750> rivets<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.200> right

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
so you can see the rivets the right

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.880 
so you can see the rivets the right
diameter<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:37.180> spacer<00:02:37.690> on<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:37.989> inside<00:02:38.470> is<00:02:38.739> the

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
diameter the spacer on the inside is the

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.780 
diameter the spacer on the inside is the
same<00:02:39.840> it's<00:02:40.840> even<00:02:41.230> pinned<00:02:41.530> over<00:02:41.709> the<00:02:42.040> same<00:02:42.280> so

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
same it's even pinned over the same so

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.120 
same it's even pinned over the same so
pretty<00:02:43.390> amazing<00:02:45.330> what<00:02:46.330> else<00:02:46.600> if<00:02:47.410> you<00:02:47.950> look

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
pretty amazing what else if you look

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.910 
pretty amazing what else if you look
inside<00:02:48.370> there's<00:02:49.090> a<00:02:49.180> internal<00:02:50.170> baffle<00:02:50.620> I<00:02:50.709> guess

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
inside there's a internal baffle I guess

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.470 
inside there's a internal baffle I guess
it<00:02:51.400> might<00:02:51.519> be<00:02:51.670> kind<00:02:51.880> of<00:02:51.940> tough<00:02:52.090> to<00:02:52.150> see<00:02:52.450> but

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
it might be kind of tough to see but

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.240 
it might be kind of tough to see but
you'll<00:02:52.930> see<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.230> picture<00:02:53.500> on<00:02:53.590> our<00:02:53.620> website

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
you'll see the picture on our website

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:01.500 
you'll see the picture on our website
and<00:02:54.630> I<00:02:56.519> guess<00:02:58.260> the<00:03:00.150> catalyst<00:03:01.150> for<00:03:01.360> this

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
and I guess the catalyst for this

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.350 
and I guess the catalyst for this
project<00:03:01.780> was<00:03:02.290> was<00:03:03.220> when<00:03:03.430> we<00:03:03.549> started<00:03:03.580> doing<00:03:04.239> in

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
project was was when we started doing in

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.580 
project was was when we started doing in
1949<00:03:05.170> panhead

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
1949 panhead

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.929 
1949 panhead
49s<00:03:08.590> had<00:03:08.709> a<00:03:08.739> one-year<00:03:09.129> only<00:03:09.280> stainless-steel

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:09.939 
49s had a one-year only stainless-steel

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:12.899 
49s had a one-year only stainless-steel
muffler<00:03:10.209> cover<00:03:10.959> and<00:03:11.349> if<00:03:12.010> you<00:03:12.219> put<00:03:12.430> them<00:03:12.579> on<00:03:12.760> the

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:12.909 
muffler cover and if you put them on the

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:14.849 
muffler cover and if you put them on the
current<00:03:13.239> reproductions<00:03:14.079> or<00:03:14.319> what<00:03:14.680> was

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.840 
let's see how that commuters up down
here<00:05:03.830> mm-hmm<00:05:05.090> it<00:05:06.090> is<00:05:06.770> exactly<00:05:07.770> the<00:05:08.190> same<00:05:08.430> you

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
here mm-hmm it is exactly the same you

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.930 
here mm-hmm it is exactly the same you
can<00:05:09.840> see<00:05:10.080> that<00:05:10.110> it's<00:05:10.500> resting<00:05:11.460> up<00:05:11.610> against
