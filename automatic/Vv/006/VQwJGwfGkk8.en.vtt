00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:40.459 

all<00:00:38.519> right<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.850> first<00:00:39.089> use<00:00:39.359> of<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.719> pine<00:00:40.079> tree

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
all right the first use of the pine tree

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.340 
all right the first use of the pine tree
we'll<00:00:40.739> go<00:00:40.890> over<00:00:41.039> is<00:00:41.339> it's<00:00:41.550> edible<00:00:41.879> use<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.510> as

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
we'll go over is it's edible use and as

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.200 
we'll go over is it's edible use and as
you<00:00:43.530> see<00:00:43.769> I<00:00:43.800> have<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.190> few<00:00:44.519> different<00:00:44.699> pine

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
you see I have a few different pine

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.899 
you see I have a few different pine
cones<00:00:45.539> here<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.079> it's<00:00:46.949> in<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.399> stage<00:00:47.729> of

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:47.909 
cones here and it's in a stage of

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:49.399 
cones here and it's in a stage of
development<00:00:47.969> now<00:00:48.690> before<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.140> actually

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:49.409 
development now before I actually

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:51.799 
development now before I actually
harvest<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.280> pine<00:00:50.610> nuts<00:00:50.969> out<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.299> the<00:00:51.539> pine

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
harvest the pine nuts out of the pine

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.649 
harvest the pine nuts out of the pine
cone<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.409> want<00:00:53.159> to<00:00:53.250> go<00:00:53.399> over<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.729> couple<00:00:54.000> stages

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:54.659 
cone I want to go over a couple stages

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:56.779 
cone I want to go over a couple stages
of<00:00:54.809> development<00:00:55.320> so<00:00:55.589> there's<00:00:56.219> two<00:00:56.430> stages

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
of development so there's two stages

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.179 
of development so there's two stages
that<00:00:57.479> you'll<00:00:57.719> see<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:57.989> pine<00:00:58.379> cone<00:00:58.680> in<00:00:58.979> its

00:00:59.179 --> 00:00:59.189 
that you'll see a pine cone in its

00:00:59.189 --> 00:01:02.689 
that you'll see a pine cone in its
development<00:00:59.869> the<00:01:00.869> first<00:01:01.170> stage<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.799> as<00:01:02.549> you

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
development the first stage is as you

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.270 
development the first stage is as you
can<00:01:02.729> see<00:01:03.119> it's<00:01:03.299> closed<00:01:03.689> up<00:01:03.989> then<00:01:04.949> as<00:01:05.129> the

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
can see it's closed up then as the

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.059 
can see it's closed up then as the
season<00:01:05.519> starts<00:01:06.119> going<00:01:06.479> along<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.470> pine<00:01:07.770> cone

00:01:08.059 --> 00:01:08.069 
season starts going along the pine cone

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:10.100 
season starts going along the pine cone
will<00:01:08.280> start<00:01:08.580> opening<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.360> releasing<00:01:09.960> its

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
will start opening and releasing its

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.190 
will start opening and releasing its
seeds<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:11.069> want<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.399> gather<00:01:11.610> them<00:01:12.200> when

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
seeds you want to gather them when

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.800 
seeds you want to gather them when
they're<00:01:13.409> closed<00:01:13.740> like<00:01:14.039> this<00:01:14.340> now<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.299> one<00:01:15.569> is

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
they're closed like this now this one is

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.529 
they're closed like this now this one is
starting<00:01:16.319> to<00:01:16.409> open<00:01:16.470> up<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.670> seed<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.240> still

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:18.539 
starting to open up the seed is still

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:21.020 
starting to open up the seed is still
inside<00:01:18.990> but<00:01:19.799> I<00:01:19.830> want<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.220> harvest<00:01:20.459> it<00:01:20.819> right

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
inside but I want to harvest it right

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.090 
inside but I want to harvest it right
away<00:01:21.179> before<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.840> starts<00:01:21.869> opening<00:01:22.409> up<00:01:22.860> like

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
away before it starts opening up like

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.669 
away before it starts opening up like
these<00:01:23.369> otherwise<00:01:23.940> it's<00:01:24.720> extremely<00:01:25.409> difficult

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:25.679 
these otherwise it's extremely difficult

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:29.149 
these otherwise it's extremely difficult
to<00:01:26.190> locate<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.789> seed<00:01:27.030> on<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.240> ground<00:01:28.159> now

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
to locate the seed on the ground now

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.430 
to locate the seed on the ground now
when<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.490> harvest<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:30.119> pine<00:01:30.390> nuts<00:01:30.720> out<00:01:30.990> of

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
when you harvest the pine nuts out of

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.669 
when you harvest the pine nuts out of
the<00:01:31.530> pine<00:01:31.799> cone<00:01:32.690> there's<00:01:33.690> two<00:01:33.929> ways<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.170> do<00:01:34.530> it

00:01:34.669 --> 00:01:34.679 
the pine cone there's two ways to do it

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:36.770 
the pine cone there's two ways to do it
if<00:01:34.860> you're<00:01:35.520> on<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.850> trail<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.330> you're<00:01:36.450> on<00:01:36.600> the

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
if you're on the trail and you're on the

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.410 
if you're on the trail and you're on the
go<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.680> can<00:01:37.710> just<00:01:37.890> split<00:01:38.460> open<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.850> top<00:01:39.180> which

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
go you can just split open the top which

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.109 
go you can just split open the top which
I'll<00:01:39.600> do<00:01:39.810> here<00:01:40.049> in<00:01:40.140> just<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.530> second<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.159> you

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
I'll do here in just a second and you

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.660 
I'll do here in just a second and you
can<00:01:42.149> dig<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.689> pine<00:01:42.930> nuts<00:01:43.200> out<00:01:43.409> that<00:01:43.710> way<00:01:43.920> but

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
can dig the pine nuts out that way but

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.490 
can dig the pine nuts out that way but
if<00:01:44.820> you're<00:01:45.000> in<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.210> campsite<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:46.109> have<00:01:46.289> your

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
if you're in a campsite you have your

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.590 
if you're in a campsite you have your
fire<00:01:46.799> built<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.399> best<00:01:47.640> way<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:47.909> do<00:01:48.210> this<00:01:48.390> is

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
fire built the best way to do this is

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.959 
fire built the best way to do this is
leave<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:48.990> by<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.350> fire<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.670> fire<00:01:50.909> will

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:50.969 
leave it by the fire and the fire will

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:54.529 
leave it by the fire and the fire will
naturally<00:01:51.840> open<00:01:52.350> each<00:01:53.100> individual<00:01:54.060> thing<00:01:54.329> up

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539

breaking<00:05:23.880> right<00:05:24.330> off<00:05:24.570> of<00:05:24.780> the<00:05:24.870> pine<00:05:25.110> tree<00:05:25.500> and

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:25.759 
breaking right off of the pine tree and

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:28.460 
breaking right off of the pine tree and
you<00:05:26.759> can<00:05:26.940> use<00:05:27.150> that<00:05:27.360> for<00:05:27.630> helping<00:05:27.990> get<00:05:28.110> a<00:05:28.169> fire

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
you can use that for helping get a fire

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:29.060 
you can use that for helping get a fire
started

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
started

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.310 
started
now<00:05:29.190> there's<00:05:29.400> also<00:05:29.610> something<00:05:30.060> that's<00:05:30.780> inside

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
now there's also something that's inside

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.290 
now there's also something that's inside
of<00:05:31.349> this<00:05:31.620> wood<00:05:31.919> usually<00:05:32.430> you<00:05:32.580> can<00:05:32.729> find<00:05:33.030> it<00:05:33.180> at

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
of this wood usually you can find it at

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.060 
of this wood usually you can find it at
the<00:05:33.419> base<00:05:33.630> of<00:05:33.659> the<00:05:33.960> pine<00:05:34.199> tree<00:05:34.470> called<00:05:34.740> fat

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
the base of the pine tree called fat

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.730 
the base of the pine tree called fat
wood<00:05:35.370> and<00:05:35.580> that<00:05:36.180> acts<00:05:36.419> as<00:05:36.630> a<00:05:36.690> flame<00:05:37.050> extender

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
wood and that acts as a flame extender

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.710 
wood and that acts as a flame extender
so<00:05:37.889> that's<00:05:38.580> not<00:05:38.789> only<00:05:39.000> going<00:05:39.270> to<00:05:39.389> give<00:05:39.539> you

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
so that's not only going to give you

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.810 
so that's not only going to give you
constant<00:05:40.169> flame<00:05:40.560> to<00:05:40.830> feed<00:05:41.070> your<00:05:41.250> fuel<00:05:41.580> on<00:05:41.789> the

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
constant flame to feed your fuel on the

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:42.200 
constant flame to feed your fuel on the
fire

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
fire

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.629 
fire
but<00:05:42.810> it's<00:05:42.960> also<00:05:43.169> an<00:05:43.470> accelerant<00:05:44.159> because<00:05:44.490> it

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 
but it's also an accelerant because it

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:47.209 
but it's also an accelerant because it
has<00:05:44.789> a<00:05:44.820> lot<00:05:45.120> of<00:05:45.150> pine<00:05:45.449> sap<00:05:45.870> in<00:05:46.139> it<00:05:46.260> so<00:05:46.979> that's

00:05:47.209 --> 00:05:47.219 
has a lot of pine sap in it so that's

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:49.640 
has a lot of pine sap in it so that's
the<00:05:47.430> fire<00:05:47.729> use<00:05:48.570> of<00:05:48.810> the<00:05:48.900> pine<00:05:49.139> tree<00:05:49.409> and<00:05:49.440> you

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
the fire use of the pine tree and you

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.559 
the fire use of the pine tree and you
can<00:05:49.680> also<00:05:49.979> use<00:05:50.370> a<00:05:50.400> lot<00:05:50.729> of<00:05:50.760> these<00:05:50.969> dead

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:51.569 
can also use a lot of these dead

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:53.629 
can also use a lot of these dead
my<00:05:51.659> needles<00:05:52.080> that<00:05:52.199> are<00:05:52.259> on<00:05:52.469> the<00:05:52.619> ground<00:05:52.770> to

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639 
my needles that are on the ground to

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:55.429 
my needles that are on the ground to
strike<00:05:53.969> a<00:05:53.999> spark<00:05:54.509> and<00:05:54.689> that'll<00:05:54.960> help<00:05:55.080> you<00:05:55.259> get

00:05:55.429 --> 00:05:55.439 
strike a spark and that'll help you get

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:58.790 
strike a spark and that'll help you get
your<00:05:55.559> fire<00:05:55.830> going<00:05:56.659> the<00:05:57.659> next<00:05:57.839> use<00:05:58.169> of<00:05:58.439> course

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
your fire going the next use of course

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.189 
your fire going the next use of course
is<00:05:59.009> the<00:05:59.159> pine<00:05:59.399> sap<00:05:59.819> and<00:06:00.149> as<00:06:00.599> you<00:06:00.809> can<00:06:00.990> see

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:01.199 
is the pine sap and as you can see

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:02.809 
is the pine sap and as you can see
there's<00:06:01.409> a<00:06:01.469> lot<00:06:01.740> of<00:06:01.889> pine<00:06:02.159> sap<00:06:02.520> that's

00:06:02.809 --> 00:06:02.819 
there's a lot of pine sap that's

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:05.119 
there's a lot of pine sap that's
dripping<00:06:03.330> down<00:06:03.479> this<00:06:03.749> limb<00:06:04.050> here<00:06:04.379> the<00:06:04.919> limb

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:05.129 
dripping down this limb here the limb

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:07.339 
dripping down this limb here the limb
most<00:06:05.459> likely<00:06:05.879> got<00:06:06.089> too<00:06:06.330> heavy<00:06:06.509> or<00:06:06.839> too<00:06:06.869> dead

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:07.349 
most likely got too heavy or too dead

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:10.040 
most likely got too heavy or too dead
and<00:06:07.619> it<00:06:07.709> just<00:06:07.949> fell<00:06:08.219> off<00:06:08.459> and<00:06:08.789> this<00:06:09.479> is<00:06:09.689> trying

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
and it just fell off and this is trying

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.739 
and it just fell off and this is trying
to<00:06:10.169> heal<00:06:10.469> itself<00:06:10.639> so<00:06:11.639> just<00:06:12.089> like<00:06:12.270> we<00:06:12.509> have

00:06:12.739 --> 00:06:12.749 
to heal itself so just like we have

00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:15.439 
to heal itself so just like we have
blood<00:06:13.050> in<00:06:13.229> our<00:06:13.409> body<00:06:13.679> the<00:06:14.219> pine<00:06:14.550> tree<00:06:14.879> has<00:06:15.089> pine

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:15.449 
blood in our body the pine tree has pine

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:18.409 
blood in our body the pine tree has pine
sap<00:06:15.869> so<00:06:16.679> you<00:06:17.069> can<00:06:17.279> see<00:06:17.520> it's<00:06:17.669> trying<00:06:17.879> to<00:06:18.059> heal

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:18.419 
sap so you can see it's trying to heal

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:21.649 
sap so you can see it's trying to heal
now<00:06:19.199> this<00:06:19.559> pine<00:06:19.860> sap<00:06:20.249> was<00:06:20.520> used<00:06:20.819> for<00:06:21.119> years<00:06:21.449> and

00:06:21.649 --> 00:06:21.659 
now this pine sap was used for years and

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:23.629 
now this pine sap was used for years and
years<00:06:21.839> by<00:06:22.080> Native<00:06:22.499> American<00:06:23.039> tribes<00:06:23.369> what

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:23.639 
years by Native American tribes what

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:25.790 
years by Native American tribes what
they<00:06:23.819> would<00:06:23.999> do<00:06:24.209> is<00:06:24.449> they<00:06:25.020> would<00:06:25.050> use<00:06:25.439> this<00:06:25.619> as

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 
they would do is they would use this as

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.249 
they would do is they would use this as
a<00:06:25.889> chewing<00:06:26.459> gum<00:06:26.490> and<00:06:26.939> yes<00:06:27.509> you<00:06:27.719> can<00:06:27.899> eat<00:06:28.080> this

00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:28.259 
a chewing gum and yes you can eat this

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:30.409 
a chewing gum and yes you can eat this
it's<00:06:28.529> full<00:06:28.830> of<00:06:29.009> sugars<00:06:29.490> so<00:06:29.729> it<00:06:29.849> will<00:06:30.059> give<00:06:30.270> you

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:30.419 
it's full of sugars so it will give you

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:32.600 
it's full of sugars so it will give you
an<00:06:30.539> energy<00:06:30.749> boost<00:06:31.020> just<00:06:32.009> like<00:06:32.189> the<00:06:32.369> pine

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:32.610 
an energy boost just like the pine

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.529 
an energy boost just like the pine
needles<00:06:33.089> and<00:06:33.300> the<00:06:33.719> pine<00:06:33.959> nuts<00:06:34.369> but<00:06:35.369> also<00:06:35.639> you

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:36.539 
needles and the pine nuts but also you

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:38.779 
needles and the pine nuts but also you
can<00:06:36.749> use<00:06:36.959> it<00:06:37.110> as<00:06:37.229> a<00:06:37.259> glue<00:06:37.589> it's<00:06:37.979> very<00:06:38.430> very

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:38.789 
can use it as a glue it's very very

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:41.809 
can use it as a glue it's very very
sticky<00:06:39.389> so<00:06:40.169> it'll<00:06:40.439> hold<00:06:40.619> together<00:06:40.949> something

00:06:41.809 --> 00:06:41.819 
sticky so it'll hold together something

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:45.199 
sticky so it'll hold together something
if<00:06:41.969> you<00:06:42.629> need<00:06:42.809> that<00:06:43.080> done<00:06:43.349> and<00:06:43.789> as<00:06:44.789> you<00:06:44.999> can<00:06:45.149> see

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:45.209 
if you need that done and as you can see

00:06:45.209 --> 00:06:53.089 
if you need that done and as you can see
here<00:06:48.199> it's<00:06:49.199> just<00:06:49.319> real<00:06:49.740> it's<00:06:50.550> real<00:06:50.849> mushy<00:06:52.099> and

00:06:53.089 --> 00:06:53.099 
here it's just real it's real mushy and

00:06:53.099 --> 00:06:57.199 
here it's just real it's real mushy and
I'll<00:06:53.639> put<00:06:53.879> this<00:06:53.999> right<00:06:54.059> back<00:06:54.300> on<00:06:54.719> the<00:06:54.869> tree<00:06:56.209> so

00:06:57.199 --> 00:06:57.209 
I'll put this right back on the tree so

00:06:57.209 --> 00:06:59.689 
I'll put this right back on the tree so
that's<00:06:57.360> a<00:06:57.569> last<00:06:57.809> and<00:06:58.019> final<00:06:58.469> two<00:06:58.830> uses<00:06:59.339> of<00:06:59.369> the

00:06:59.689 --> 00:06:59.699 
that's a last and final two uses of the

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:02.119 
that's a last and final two uses of the
pine<00:06:59.999> tree<00:07:00.300> now<00:07:01.019> there's<00:07:01.259> one<00:07:01.469> other<00:07:01.499> thing<00:07:02.009> I

00:07:02.119 --> 00:07:02.129 
pine tree now there's one other thing I

00:07:02.129 --> 00:07:04.249 
pine tree now there's one other thing I
want<00:07:02.369> to<00:07:02.459> go<00:07:02.610> over<00:07:02.969> and<00:07:03.180> that's<00:07:03.959> the

00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:04.259 
want to go over and that's the

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:07.040 
want to go over and that's the
environment<00:07:04.919> I<00:07:05.129> don't<00:07:05.729> recommend<00:07:06.300> touching

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.050 
environment I don't recommend touching

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.469 
environment I don't recommend touching
anything<00:07:07.439> like<00:07:08.159> this<00:07:08.459> unless<00:07:08.729> you're<00:07:09.269> in<00:07:09.389> a

00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:09.479 
anything like this unless you're in a
