 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.509
 fishing online magazine on the hook and 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.460
 today we will show you how to tie here 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.260
 such a nodal connection that we 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.330
 now see on the screen called 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.789
 palomar this knot 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.099
 widely known among fishermen due to 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.820
 its reliability and comparative simplicity 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.719
 execution he is able to keep order 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.070
 90 percent of line strength 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:37.829
 at the same time some anglers joke 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.360
 that possessing some dexterity of him 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.140
 can be tied up even in the dark 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.780
 of the disadvantages of this site include 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.539
 following the first is a big expense 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.000
 fishing line necessary for tying something 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.600
 has fishing line waste are pretty 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.360
 large and second this node is not always 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.489
 can be tied with small ears 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.230
 hole that is if we have a hook with 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.260
 small hole and there can not 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.380
 go double lick then tie this 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.479
 node we will not work now let's 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.080
 let's see how it will look like 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.409
 the process of making ties at our school 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.210
 mock up and i will use for this 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:22.110
 nylon thread to be seen better 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.150
 the camera is good so attention to the screen 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.000
 we have a training swivel 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.159
 and we have a nylon thread which 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.470
 Replaces our fishing line that we need to do 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.680
 to tie this knot first fold 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:39.020
 we take it in half we add up 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:42.840
 in half and skip in the ear missed 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:48.149
 so it will be better everyone can do it further 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:52.200
 just such a loop and one turn is visible to everyone 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:55.560
 now here in this image formed 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.049
 ring in this loop we have to thread himself 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.000
 the subject that we tie here is my 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.000
 pass and tighten 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.000
 when we use fishing line necessarily 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.150
 need to wet when tightening this node in 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.769
 principle like all nodes that are 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.860
 we tie when using 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:21.500
 monoleski if we use both 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:25.400
 use braid then do it not 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:28.489
 necessarily here in principle and the whole node 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.260
 I called on you so much for your attention
