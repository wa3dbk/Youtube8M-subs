00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.470 
wasn't doing that all right that piece
like<00:02:13.360> down<00:02:13.600> i<00:02:13.840> think<00:02:14.410> that<00:02:14.560> with<00:02:15.010> these<00:02:15.480> you

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
like down i think that with these you

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.960 
like down i think that with these you
probably<00:02:17.050> have<00:02:17.319> to<00:02:17.350> get<00:02:17.739> it<00:02:17.890> at<00:02:18.070> that<00:02:18.250> maximum

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
probably have to get it at that maximum

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.440 
probably have to get it at that maximum
heat<00:02:19.980> because<00:02:20.980> it<00:02:21.160> was<00:02:21.310> not<00:02:21.550> furlan<00:02:22.030> like<00:02:22.209> this

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
heat because it was not furlan like this

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.690 
heat because it was not furlan like this
this<00:02:22.959> last<00:02:23.620> night<00:02:23.860> when<00:02:24.040> i<00:02:24.070> first<00:02:24.370> put<00:02:24.580> the

my<00:04:49.280> con<00:04:49.640> air<00:04:50.000> I<00:04:50.419> think<00:04:50.780> this<00:04:50.870> is<00:04:51.080> a<00:04:51.110> one<00:04:51.410> inch

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
my con air I think this is a one inch

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:57.940 
my con air I think this is a one inch
barrel<00:04:52.100> and<00:04:52.340> I<00:04:52.970> said<00:04:53.270> it<00:04:53.390> too<00:04:53.630> I<00:04:56.410> guess<00:04:57.410> 13

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
barrel and I said it too I guess 13

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
barrel and I said it too I guess 13
maybe<00:04:58.250> 12<00:04:58.669> there<00:04:59.300> they're<00:04:59.960> odd<00:05:00.169> numbered<00:05:00.970> so

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
maybe 12 there they're odd numbered so

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.960 
maybe 12 there they're odd numbered so
that's<00:05:02.870> what<00:05:03.050> it<00:05:03.080> is<00:05:03.380> and<00:05:03.860> it<00:05:04.340> actually<00:05:04.520> came

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970
