00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
all right I got them caught in my proton

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:09.610 
all right I got them caught in my proton
beam<00:01:08.120> let<00:01:08.390> me<00:01:08.479> slam<00:01:08.750> them<00:01:08.930> on<00:01:09.020> the<00:01:09.200> ground<00:01:09.500> to

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:09.620 
beam let me slam them on the ground to

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.670 
beam let me slam them on the ground to
stun<00:01:09.830> them<00:01:09.950> throw<00:01:10.729> out<00:01:10.790> my<00:01:10.940> trap<00:01:11.380> and<00:01:12.380> let's

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
stun them throw out my trap and let's

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.910 
stun them throw out my trap and let's
see<00:01:12.800> if<00:01:12.830> we<00:01:12.950> can<00:01:13.159> reel<00:01:13.790> him<00:01:13.820> in<00:01:14.619> there<00:01:15.619> we<00:01:15.800> go

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
see if we can reel him in there we go

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.800 
see if we can reel him in there we go
we've<00:01:16.159> caught<00:01:16.400> Slimer<00:01:16.700> again<00:01:17.060> you<00:01:17.570> can<00:01:17.690> see

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
me and let's see if we can create more

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:22.090 
me and let's see if we can create more
destruction<00:01:21.229> in<00:01:21.440> the<00:01:21.530> environment<00:01:21.979> and

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
destruction in the environment and

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.710 
destruction in the environment and
getting<00:01:22.520> rest<00:01:22.759> of<00:01:22.850> the<00:01:22.910> people<00:01:23.180> to<00:01:23.300> run<00:01:23.540> out

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
and and run away scared of that megawatt

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.880 
and and run away scared of that megawatt
proton<00:01:28.580> being<00:01:28.790> struck<00:01:29.119> upon<00:01:29.270> my<00:01:29.540> back<00:01:29.740> so<00:01:30.740> this

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
proton being struck upon my back so this

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.859 
proton being struck upon my back so this
is<00:01:31.369> about<00:01:31.550> 200<00:01:31.940> people<00:01:32.030> but<00:01:32.210> it's<00:01:32.450> not<00:01:32.600> enough

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
is about 200 people but it's not enough

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:35.080 
is about 200 people but it's not enough
to<00:01:33.110> simulate<00:01:33.619> realistic<00:01:34.220> crowds<00:01:34.580> we<00:01:34.729> need<00:01:34.880> for

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
to simulate realistic crowds we need for

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.550 
to simulate realistic crowds we need for
ghostbusters<00:01:35.570> after<00:01:36.050> all<00:01:36.140> this<00:01:36.259> is<00:01:36.380> New<00:01:36.530> York

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
ghostbusters after all this is New York
