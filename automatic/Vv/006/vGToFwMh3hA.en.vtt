00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:07.319
 Servus people there should be reported 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.780
 calories are great again this time 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.940
 smash brothers against the level 5 n 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.769
 I live the whole thing and have to go by the way 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.389
 still neighbors so the game or 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.320
 or gameplay is not now 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.580
 quite so crucial 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.650
 and we play at the smash da think 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.960
 I sometimes disappears the match I have 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.150
 have live stream from nintendo today 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.410
 so many games manipulated like that 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.880
 but that you are interested 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.769
 probably against max one extra 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.420
 make video but it was of course that 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.430
 That's why I'm playing 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.440
 actually bought nintendo wii 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.540
 So a video because great smash 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.860
 brothers ye know another one 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.960
 I video you and since removed 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.430
 important time have it on sooner 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.950
 played tournaments and in my 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.739
 pretty much with friends and leisure 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.680
 I'm definitely back in the game 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.100
 to bring to my channel at that time was 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.809
 that he is not that possible yet 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.199
 The game has been quite a long time 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.870
 outside call of duty and there you have 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:08.310
 Of course something else gambled 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:11.040
 as a human and as I said that will become 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.900
 but then change very fast if that 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.939
 comes out I think that will too 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.030
 This time, it will be quite popular 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.549
 it gets relatively healed b is it 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.370
 play par excellence c 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:27.380
 it comes here with ab and c 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:29.120
 peaches there the other is then stop 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.620
 After that, quite a few youtuber this 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.440
 game luckily to find pretty cool 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.610
 So I'm just thinking of italy 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.980
 played and I think you can still 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.970
 his really cool tournaments are people 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.120
 challenge 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.230
 challenge subscribers and therefore 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.020
 I'll start again now 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:48.290
 little bit of smash because 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.930
 People get used to it 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.240
 have and now that's initially too 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.920
 release rum to escape but to this 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.110
 bypass 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:01.100
 therefore unfortunately plays the old part 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:04.280
 it's only against computer opponents because 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:07.670
 the nintendo your online service stuff 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.590
 for this work is for this game 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.930
 I can not have any closed hans 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.900
 duels against any people online 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.490
 I'm sorry but I say so 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.320
 until then, the computer opponent should 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.230
 rich level 9 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.870
 but I have to say relatively strong 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.270
 at least if you start again sooner 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.440
 I have three levels 9 against alene 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.140
 for brussels I already have 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.840
 difficulties with one 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.280
 but as I said it all comes back 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.840
 and I would like to know if I am 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.520
 maybe the track 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.989
 shut off say if I might 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.790
 should do some tutorials or 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.890
 or the game for the first time 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.380
 should clarify that it is up to why 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.910
 to her having percent percent why 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.340
 he never play here every minute 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.080
 So just go down so why 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.680
 people from estate rose and my point 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.300
 perfect so all i could give you one 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.670
 bit also explain what it is with these 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.590
 has to roll on when you're doing here 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.240
 not go button smashing or must 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.810
 Enter any wild combos 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:12.240
 but be relatively much through movement 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:15.810
 It's true and that's cool 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:18.870
 You can even play the game completely 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.970
 so relative and I hope that this 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.040
 a nintendo that never messes up that 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.550
 online mode et cetera that's ok 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:30.540
 sports moderately right can gamble a mod 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:35.480
 for the old game is even in the spot 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:37.830
 in there so it is played correctly and 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.080
 I think you can do many cool things 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.180
 make it with me and there it will me 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.850
 just interested to know if any of the 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.050
 the game or what they are going to do 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.340
 to pick up the game if you like 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.770
 would be interested if I was such a 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.320
 a little bit about the game 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:55.320
 I also thought about it 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.570
 since I'm at the time when I tell a story 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.040
 what I want to jump against it wirecard 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.630
 I think I will with the max or 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.340
 will definitely be online with the wax 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.870
 I continue to come on my pc 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.550
 now finally I'm going to 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.020
 on the pc rail again look at whether 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.240
 you can bring something cool 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.310
 I think with the max I'm off 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.760
 and play it a bit tough 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.739
 when I downloaded then 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.150
 and I was the one for the xbox still 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.459
 on the sofa that will definitely be 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.410
 come and I think of the new call 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.470
 of duty or probably show 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:29.010
 I will not play this nice long 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:31.950
 and then I have before now 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:34.320
 soon to be so measurable for the 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.240
 eu may be released in the 3ds 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.080
 time to make a kind of longplay no 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.159
 but ultimately 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:43.379
 So one hour or two speaks like that 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:44.909
 friends as I said if your partners 

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:46.770
 calculator because there is all that 

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:50.580
 possibility can make live streams and 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.710
 that's gonna be you, I'll have one 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.900
 Longplay should do so from the old part 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:58.500
 Talk about story mode all 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:00.810
 get characters because I'm so bad 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:04.469
 The game really makes it fun to watch 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:10.020
 in story mode at least one or 

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:12.479
 another cool situation at around it 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.430
 has the fun and i think you and 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:16.379
 Bye bye twelve hours are bringing pope 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.990
 The people were so annoyed every day three 

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:22.620
 Follow up uploads and the customer cook 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:25.919
 university one writes the comments 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.569
 as he says something like this, I guess 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:31.919
 some like they are interesting 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:33.419
 but as I mentioned before I want 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:35.759
 now the games bring me right 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:39.210
 make a bock and then remember that too 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:42.289
 people yes i would say that was it 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.289
 makes good chances
