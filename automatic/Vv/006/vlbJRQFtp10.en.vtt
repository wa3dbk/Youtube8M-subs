00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.650
 edit mine are not 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:08.630
 you can take another video 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:13.240
 of the planet runs after a lot 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.240
 you are with the song 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:21.720
 far from 6 volts as this song is 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.720
 very easy you have 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:30.190
 5 errors if they have 5 hours and are re 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.900
 I think this time do not put them or you run 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.720
 in the fifth top of the video because 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:39.040
 I do not find some flavors so 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:41.530
 this would leave would be the king who already know then 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.930
 the first finger on the rope 3 of 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.450
 Fret the second finger on the string 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:50.879
 one of fretting and the third finger in the 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.879
 fret rope 2 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:01:01.680
 then 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:05.220
 we continue with this one that is getting in the 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.970
 second fret the third finger in the 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:12.330
 fifth run behind the trust wot the 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:15.960
 fret forgiveness four and in the fourth 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.470
 finger in the third on the fourth string 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.470
 of 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.340
 and in the fourth block of the fourth fret 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.500
 I'm recording a lot could be something else 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.500
 or less so 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:40.679
 then we lower these two fingers to make 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.950
 the next one runs we just go down one 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:42.950
 rope 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.320
 wanting more or less like that 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:02.320
 then light up we go through the bleach 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:06.250
 this is if with the middle finger that would come 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:10.390
 to be like that in the second finger in the 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:14.080
 string 3 of the fifth fret 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.870
 345 from the fourth fret the finger three 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.660
 in the fifth cap of the fifth fret and 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:27.690
 the fourth finger in the third in the 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:27.690
 fourth saves the fifth fret that is 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:42.670
 then the last run would come to be 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:46.600
 this we run the drought until the 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.280
 fifth fret and that is to say we run in the 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:56.580
 strap is the fifth fret practically 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:56.580
 from here the third and so 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.170
 I do not care anymore 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.250
 once again this is 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:35.680
 I do not care about your life I get the skewer 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.680
 I will be far from here 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:56.810
 already 100 or so would already be 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.569
 question of you perfecting it 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:04.129
 more because I this song does not make me 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:06.349
 much need to practice it and then that's what 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:07.909
 basic and the only one that appears at 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:27.050
 beginning being bad and maybe I know 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:29.750
 contributed they know but it's something I do not know 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.789
 how it is but is more action 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:35.590
 the forecast is good that's been all 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:35.590
 Thank you, I hope you have served them
