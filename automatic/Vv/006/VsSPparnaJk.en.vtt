00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:06.750
 hello everyone and welcome to my 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.719
 channel culinary miniature 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.059
 very attractive direction and how 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.490
 do without tasty juicy fruits 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.130
 so in this video I will show how 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.670
 make a kiwi fruit sausage 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.710
 but first you need to be inspired, you can 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.439
 take a real gamer cut off and 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.250
 see how it is arranged by 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.890
 find colorful bright juicy pictures 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.020
 this delicious fruit in the work I will 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.820
 use four polymer colors 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.410
 clay green yellow white and black 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.620
 I also need a rolling pin to 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.750
 roll out thin layers 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:49.079
 Getting Started Green Kiev 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.000
 very bright sunny saturated and even 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.730
 closer to salads to his shade than 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.780
 some kind of grass green so i 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.210
 I mix green with yellow well 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.760
 mix these colors to get 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.519
 homogeneous mass without divorces and 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.729
 different firmware i also need 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.729
 very light pale yellow color therefore 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.280
 I mix a piece of white plastic with 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.350
 a small piece of yellow also 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.369
 mix thoroughly until smooth 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.950
 state to mass turned 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.729
 monochromatic of two resulting flowers i 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.270
 will do 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.619
 the flesh of the fruit for this I roll these 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.079
 color layers 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.689
 the same thickness at me it seams 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.479
 about 3 millimeters thick and 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.600
 spout will need to do smooth 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.390
 color transition for this i cut out 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.240
 yellow and green rectangular 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.600
 triangles and put them together 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.899
 to make a diagonal rectangle 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.909
 divides this rectangle into two colors 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:57.090
 pretty blinding these layers between 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.490
 by myself and pull out a little bit 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.490
 this rectangle 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.430
 well after that fold in half and 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.520
 again roll out the same 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.390
 direction and then folded again 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.010
 in half and pull out roll in length 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.019
 then again fold in half 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.690
 then again and again 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:20.300
 it is very important to put in a square 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.290
 always in one direction otherwise not 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.610
 get a smooth color transition 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.640
 gradually the rectangles will start 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.040
 appear strips that already say about 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.860
 the fact that a smooth color transition is obtained 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.530
 need to fold roll out until then 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.709
 until you get a smooth color transition 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.470
 from green to yellow as a result 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:45.080
 multiple folding and rolling 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.569
 I have a smooth layer 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.330
 color change from green to yellow 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:53.750
 this color transition is peculiar 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:57.260
 and fruit to the center of the lighter open 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:00.380
 in a darker this class and I stack 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:03.799
 I squeeze well into the block so that 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.340
 resulted in a petal with one 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.500
 the edges 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.070
 this petal is yellow from the other side 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:13.459
 green and yellow side this petal 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:16.130
 you need to do get thinner with a block 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:19.700
 droplet shape if you look at it 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:22.519
 top now take a piece of green 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.890
 plastics of that green which is mixed with 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:28.459
 yellow roll up to about thickness 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.739
 3-4 millimeters and cut out of it 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:34.670
 rectangle across the block thickness 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.690
 petal take black color and rolled from 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.390
 him sausage 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.750
 And now pay attention how exactly I am 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:45.230
 put these black sausages is the future 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:48.079
 kiwi bones I put 2 sausages on 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.510
 one half green rectangle and 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:53.569
 then rolled up this rectangle 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.970
 in half and covered these two sausages a 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:59.060
 between sausages I put 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.960
 little green stripes to carry 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.630
 all of you 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:06.140
 name I still pull out a little 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:09.980
 petal with color transition and do in 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:13.040
 I cut it I do not cut it in half I do 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:16.310
 about him exactly the incision and this incision 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:20.110
 I insert a green rectangle with two 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.110
 black sausages with stones 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.390
 now this resulting block is needed 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.790
 pull out yes very very long thickness 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:35.470
 How sausages are drawn I already have a lot 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:38.840
 just show and in his master classes in 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:42.710
 I've got such a long one 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:45.800
 sausage is all part of the future of kiwi this 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:48.200
 I cut the sausage into many pieces by 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.140
 two centimeters in length how many 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:55.150
 parts it will be unimportant that this 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:58.670
 the sausage was a thin narrow strip 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:01.010
 now I connect all these parts together 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:04.190
 so that the bright side 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:08.470
 sausages yellow part looked inside and 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:11.030
 the dark green part looked out 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:14.840
 I take the remnants of light yellow plastic 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:17.960
 we roll a plump sausage out of it for 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:21.470
 center is placed in the center of kiwi 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.220
 cut off all unnecessary and tamp this one 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.310
 sausage 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.470
 I don't want to brown me the skin 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.690
 it seems that for this sausage it will be 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.430
 look a little rough the 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.620
 more in the future when i will 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.630
 use this sausage on cakes 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.300
 brown peel on the cake will 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:41.600
 I will look so I want 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:44.540
 wrap this sausage a dark green 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:47.380
 I roll dark green to thin 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:50.480
 strip about 1 millimeter thick and 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:53.660
 wrap kiwi in this dark green 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:57.700
 color and then you need to shrink the fruit 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:06:00.350
 squeeze and go as usual from center to edge 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:03.230
 I 'll leave the sausage for work 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:06.800
 surface patterned up form on 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:10.550
 him a waist and then press 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:12.470
 and the edges of the sausage leveling and so on 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:16.610
 narrowing a little in the center 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:19.430
 then the edges of the sausage becomes more 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:22.100
 plastic and and it becomes easier to tighten and 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:24.770
 it will gradually be drawn out 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.960
 I do not roll the sausage over the surface 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.690
 because drawing inside can 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:33.380
 a little spin I already have my sausage 

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:35.540
 it is in the hands you can ride a sausage 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:38.780
 that you trim it a little bit to 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:41.420
 she did not remain clumsy and this sausage 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:44.390
 can be rolled up to any thickness 

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:47.750
 you can leave it bigger and make it out 

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:50.240
 her beads and you can roll up to very 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:57.050
 thin sausages and make out of it 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:59.410
 details for culinary miniature I cut 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:00.940
 sausage in half and I get 

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:03.760
 kiwi 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:06.680
 Of course this is not the easiest way. 

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:08.950
 making sausages with a pattern of kiwi but 

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:11.480
 It seems to me that this method is the most 

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:13.870
 realistic it seems to me that such 

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:16.820
 the sausage looks realistic 

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:19.640
 decorative neat and beautiful 

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:22.520
 at the same time wish you creative 

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:25.420
 success and inspiration and plenty 

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:28.220
 fruit projects way ahead summer
