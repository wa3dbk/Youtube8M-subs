00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:11.230
 listen to me, the graduate poets move 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:17.339
 only among the plants with little names 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:20.859
 used boxwoods or privates for me 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:24.460
 I love the streets that succeed in grassy areas 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:27.279
 I was where in puddles half dried 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.579
 grab the boys a few haggard 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:33.550
 eel the lanes that follow i 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:36.940
 ciglioni descend among the tufts of the 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.440
 canes put deaths in the trees 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.050
 of lemons 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.890
 better if the birds do 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:49.760
 off swallowed by the 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:54.260
 glasses you listen to the branches whisper 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:57.979
 friends in the air who almost do not move and 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:02.149
 the senses of this smell that snores at 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:05.380
 coming off the ground and a chest raining 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:09.140
 restless sweetness 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:11.929
 here some fun passions for 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.219
 miracle is silent war here also touches 

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:15.229
 to us poor 

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:19.539
 our share of wealth and it is 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.539
 the smell of lemons 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.220
 you see 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:29.070
 in these silences in which things 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.940
 they abandon and seem close to betray 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.780
 their last secret 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:39.500
 then one is expected to discover one 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:43.430
 mistake of nature the deadlock of the 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:46.490
 world a ring that does not hold the wire from 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:51.230
 to untangle that finally put us 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:54.770
 in the midst of a truth the gaze escape 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:59.810
 around the mind investigates rope 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:05.560
 disunits in the scent that spreads when 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:09.590
 the most languishing are the silences 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:14.520
 in which we see in every human shadow that 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:19.890
 some disturbance goes away 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:23.430
 divinity but the illusion is missing and there 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.070
 brings time back to noisy cities 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.880
 where the blue appears only to 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:34.350
 pieces in high tranesi but if the rain 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.690
 tired the earth then the thick the tedium 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.350
 of the winter on the houses the light is made to 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:44.910
 bitter race the soul 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:47.070
 when one day from a mobster door 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:51.360
 among the trees of a court there is 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:54.610
 show the yellow of the lemon trees the sky 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:58.840
 of the heart is known 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:04.080
 and their breasts roar their songs 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.080
 the golden trumpets of la la
