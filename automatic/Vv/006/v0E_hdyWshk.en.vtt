of<00:01:46.340> mine<00:01:46.399> did<00:01:46.819> suggest<00:01:47.359> using<00:01:47.630> regular<00:01:48.350> primer

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700

on<00:01:49.700> latex<00:01:50.090> paint<00:01:51.249> you<00:01:52.249> know<00:01:52.399> the<00:01:52.549> primary<00:01:52.759> use

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
on latex paint you know the primary use

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.300 
on latex paint you know the primary use
before<00:01:53.179> you<00:01:53.420> paint<00:01:53.600> your<00:01:53.749> walls<00:01:53.929> and<00:01:54.310> that

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
before you paint your walls and that

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.730 
before you paint your walls and that
part<00:01:55.520> would<00:01:55.609> work<00:01:55.789> pretty<00:01:55.999> good<00:01:56.530> you<00:01:57.530> know<00:01:57.560> the

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
part would work pretty good you know the

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.010 
part would work pretty good you know the
real<00:01:57.889> issue<00:01:58.249> is<00:01:58.459> the<00:01:58.700> real<00:01:58.850> dark<00:01:59.209> rock<00:01:59.479> so<00:01:59.929> if

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
real issue is the real dark rock so if

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.059 
real issue is the real dark rock so if
you<00:02:00.139> can<00:02:00.289> find<00:02:02.380> lighter<00:02:03.380> rocks<00:02:03.679> this<00:02:03.920> is<00:02:04.039> a

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
you can find lighter rocks this is a

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:05.980 
you can find lighter rocks this is a
heart-shaped<00:02:04.459> Rock<00:02:04.909> I<00:02:05.090> might<00:02:05.299> just<00:02:05.539> keep<00:02:05.719> that

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
heart-shaped Rock I might just keep that

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.760 
heart-shaped Rock I might just keep that
or<00:02:06.200> I<00:02:06.229> make<00:02:06.469> peanut<00:02:06.799> red<00:02:06.950> later<00:02:07.219> do<00:02:08.209> anything

really<00:02:24.880> like<00:02:25.030> these<00:02:25.210> metallic<00:02:25.750> paints<00:02:26.170> do

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
really like these metallic paints do

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.840 
really like these metallic paints do
they're<00:02:26.560> really<00:02:26.590> a<00:02:26.830> lot<00:02:26.890> of<00:02:27.040> fun<00:02:27.280> and<00:02:27.490> I<00:02:27.610> just

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
they're really a lot of fun and I just

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:34.110 
they're really a lot of fun and I just
kind<00:02:28.030> of<00:02:28.120> just<00:02:28.300> do<00:02:28.450> paint<00:02:28.870> brush<00:02:29.050> in<00:02:29.290> paint<00:02:33.120> one

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
kind of just do paint brush in paint one

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:44.190 
kind of just do paint brush in paint one
side<00:02:34.420> of<00:02:34.570> the<00:02:34.660> rock<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:43.000> then<00:02:43.390> I<00:02:43.420> let<00:02:43.750> it<00:02:43.870> sit<00:02:44.050> -

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
side of the rock and then I let it sit -

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.740 
side of the rock and then I let it sit -
Drock<00:02:44.470> okay<00:02:44.980> and<00:02:45.190> here's<00:02:45.370> one<00:02:45.550> I<00:02:45.580> well<00:02:46.120> this

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
Drock okay and here's one I well this

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.780 
Drock okay and here's one I well this
looks<00:02:46.870> like<00:02:47.050> it<00:02:47.230> could<00:02:47.380> use<00:02:47.500> another<00:02:47.980> coat<00:02:48.370> so

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
looks like it could use another coat so

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.490 
looks like it could use another coat so
I'll<00:02:48.910> put<00:02:49.120> a<00:02:49.150> little<00:02:49.360> bit<00:02:49.450> more<00:02:49.750> on<00:02:49.930> there<00:02:52.500> the

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
I'll put a little bit more on there the

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.200 
I'll put a little bit more on there the
metallics<00:02:54.100> are<00:02:54.190> kind<00:02:54.400> of<00:02:54.490> transparent<00:02:55.090> but

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.210 
metallics are kind of transparent but

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.500 
metallics are kind of transparent but
they're<00:02:55.330> so<00:02:55.480> cool<00:02:55.690> look<00:02:55.840> at<00:02:55.960> it<00:02:57.300> click<00:02:58.300> my

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
they're so cool look at it click my

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.510 
they're so cool look at it click my
battery<00:02:58.930> had<00:02:59.080> just<00:02:59.260> gone<00:02:59.410> dead<00:02:59.890> on<00:03:00.070> my<00:03:00.250> flip

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
battery had just gone dead on my flip

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:09.560 
battery had just gone dead on my flip
camera<00:03:00.790> so<00:03:01.180> we're<00:03:01.600> going<00:03:01.780> to<00:03:01.870> start<00:03:02.110> again<00:03:02.700> so

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.820 

basically<00:03:10.570> that's<00:03:10.780> all<00:03:10.960> you<00:03:11.110> do<00:03:11.290> is<00:03:11.470> you<00:03:11.560> paint

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
basically that's all you do is you paint

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.730 
basically that's all you do is you paint
once<00:03:12.670> if<00:03:12.880> one<00:03:13.240> side<00:03:13.450> dries<00:03:13.780> you<00:03:14.020> turn<00:03:14.260> over<00:03:14.290> and

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
once if one side dries you turn over and

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.590 
once if one side dries you turn over and
you<00:03:14.830> can<00:03:15.010> paint<00:03:15.280> the<00:03:15.430> other<00:03:15.550> side<00:03:15.730> again

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
you can paint the other side again

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.470 
you can paint the other side again
so<00:03:17.440> I'm<00:03:17.860> going<00:03:18.040> to<00:03:18.130> do<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.550> back<00:03:18.790> sides<00:03:19.209> of

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
so I'm going to do the back sides of

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.210 
so I'm going to do the back sides of
these<00:03:19.660> of<00:03:20.700> okay<00:03:21.730> I<00:03:22.560> could<00:03:23.560> put<00:03:23.800> paint<00:03:24.040> on<00:03:24.160> a

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
these of okay I could put paint on a

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.630 
these of okay I could put paint on a
pallet<00:03:24.700> but<00:03:24.850> I'm<00:03:25.000> too<00:03:25.180> lazy<00:03:25.360> to<00:03:25.600> do<00:03:25.750> that<00:03:26.640> know

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
pallet but I'm too lazy to do that know

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.280 
pallet but I'm too lazy to do that know
if<00:03:28.590> it's<00:03:29.590> hard<00:03:29.800> to<00:03:29.920> tell<00:03:30.570> what's<00:03:31.570> a<00:03:31.750> good<00:03:31.990> view

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
if it's hard to tell what's a good view

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.510 
if it's hard to tell what's a good view
for<00:03:32.740> that<00:03:32.950> camera<00:03:33.390> now<00:03:34.390> look<00:03:34.660> at<00:03:34.750> the<00:03:34.840> video<00:03:34.959> so

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
for that camera now look at the video so

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.900 
for that camera now look at the video so
anyways<00:03:37.860> that's<00:03:38.860> painting<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:39.520> other<00:03:39.640> side

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
anyways that's painting the other side

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:50.170 
anyways that's painting the other side
of<00:03:40.060> that<00:03:40.180> blue<00:03:40.480> one<00:03:41.280> blue

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.630 

and<00:03:51.180> so<00:03:52.050> when<00:03:52.200> I've<00:03:52.320> got<00:03:52.530> one<00:03:52.740> that's<00:03:52.770> painted

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
and so when I've got one that's painted

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.690 
and so when I've got one that's painted
let's<00:03:54.210> see<00:03:54.450> this<00:03:54.770> one<00:03:55.770> this<00:03:56.100> green<00:03:56.460> one

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
let's see this one this green one

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.360 
let's see this one this green one
probably<00:03:57.180> ain't<00:03:57.570> good<00:03:57.900> enough<00:03:58.220> put<00:03:59.220> on<00:03:59.340> a

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
probably ain't good enough put on a

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.030 
probably ain't good enough put on a
couple<00:03:59.790> coats<00:04:00.000> depending<00:04:00.570> on<00:04:00.990> how<00:04:01.200> light<00:04:02.010> or

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
couple coats depending on how light or

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.390 
couple coats depending on how light or
dark<00:04:02.190> the<00:04:02.640> rock<00:04:02.880> is<00:04:03.210> and<00:04:03.800> then<00:04:04.800> I'm<00:04:05.010> ready<00:04:05.220> to

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
dark the rock is and then I'm ready to

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.900 
dark the rock is and then I'm ready to
actually<00:04:06.390> write<00:04:06.660> on<00:04:06.900> it<00:04:07.140> I<00:04:07.350> use<00:04:08.100> right<00:04:08.700> now<00:04:08.760> I'm

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
actually write on it I use right now I'm

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.930 
actually write on it I use right now I'm
using<00:04:09.030> two<00:04:09.420> different<00:04:09.750> kinds<00:04:10.020> of<00:04:10.110> things<00:04:10.940> I'm

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
using two different kinds of things I'm

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.510 
using two different kinds of things I'm
using<00:04:12.210> these<00:04:12.510> sharp<00:04:12.930> Sharpie<00:04:13.710> poster<00:04:14.250> paint

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
using these sharp Sharpie poster paint

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.110 
using these sharp Sharpie poster paint
markers<00:04:15.350> there<00:04:16.350> water<00:04:16.620> a<00:04:16.980> water<00:04:17.640> base<00:04:17.880> and

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
markers there water a water base and

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.000 
markers there water a water base and
then<00:04:18.239> I<00:04:18.269> bought<00:04:18.570> this<00:04:18.720> galaxy<00:04:19.290> marker<00:04:19.709> at<00:04:19.920> the

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
then I bought this galaxy marker at the

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.970 
then I bought this galaxy marker at the
craft<00:04:20.220> store<00:04:20.340> and<00:04:20.930> this<00:04:21.930> is<00:04:22.080> a<00:04:22.109> broader<00:04:22.530> tip

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:22.980 
craft store and this is a broader tip

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.880 
craft store and this is a broader tip
and<00:04:23.310> this<00:04:23.460> has<00:04:23.670> a<00:04:23.700> finer<00:04:24.060> tip<00:04:24.450> Ivan<00:04:25.290> decided

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
and this has a finer tip Ivan decided

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.600 
and this has a finer tip Ivan decided
exactly<00:04:26.010> which<00:04:26.460> one<00:04:26.670> I<00:04:26.700> like<00:04:27.000> the<00:04:27.210> best<00:04:27.240> but<00:04:28.050> I

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
L on that I thought that looks kind of

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.470 
L on that I thought that looks kind of
funky<00:05:00.390> I<00:05:00.830> don't<00:05:01.830> like<00:05:02.040> how<00:05:02.550> it's<00:05:02.760> looking<00:05:03.180> so

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.480 
funky I don't like how it's looking so

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.380 
funky I don't like how it's looking so
with<00:05:04.169> the<00:05:04.290> poster<00:05:04.830> paint<00:05:05.180> they're<00:05:06.180> water

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 
with the poster paint they're water

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.420 
with the poster paint they're water
soluble<00:05:06.840> so<00:05:07.260> you<00:05:07.350> can<00:05:07.530> take<00:05:07.740> a<00:05:07.770> write<00:05:08.070> off<00:05:08.100> with

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
soluble so you can take a write off with

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.540 
soluble so you can take a write off with
water<00:05:08.900> as<00:05:09.900> long<00:05:10.020> as<00:05:10.320> you<00:05:10.410> do<00:05:10.530> it<00:05:10.680> fairly

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
water as long as you do it fairly

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.409 
water as long as you do it fairly
quickly<00:05:12.000> too<00:05:12.330> when<00:05:12.540> you<00:05:12.750> just<00:05:14.120> painted<00:05:15.120> it

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
quickly too when you just painted it

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.960 
quickly too when you just painted it
you'll<00:05:15.840> come<00:05:16.020> off<00:05:16.140> really<00:05:16.410> easily<00:05:16.740> the<00:05:17.550> galaxy

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
you'll come off really easily the galaxy

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.830 
you'll come off really easily the galaxy
markers<00:05:18.360> I<00:05:18.650> don't<00:05:19.650> think<00:05:20.270> all<00:05:21.270> I<00:05:21.330> know<00:05:21.600> is<00:05:21.660> that

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
markers I don't think all I know is that

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.350 
markers I don't think all I know is that
they're<00:05:21.960> acid-free<00:05:22.890> that's<00:05:23.430> what<00:05:23.730> it<00:05:23.910> tells

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
they're acid-free that's what it tells

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.670 
they're acid-free that's what it tells
me<00:05:24.630> but<00:05:24.870> I<00:05:25.260> know<00:05:25.590> these<00:05:25.830> are<00:05:26.010> water<00:05:26.220> soluble<00:05:26.580> so

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
me but I know these are water soluble so

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:34.870 
me but I know these are water soluble so
I'll<00:05:28.680> try<00:05:29.070> it<00:05:29.130> again

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:41.960 

so<00:05:35.880> these<00:05:36.060> are<00:05:36.270> real<00:05:36.690> easy<00:05:39.440> to<00:05:40.440> do<00:05:41.340> again<00:05:41.520> if

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
so these are real easy to do again if

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.630 
so these are real easy to do again if
you<00:05:42.090> think<00:05:42.120> you've<00:05:42.510> made<00:05:42.690> a<00:05:42.750> mistake<00:05:43.640> that's

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.640 
you think you've made a mistake that's

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:50.990 
you think you've made a mistake that's
all<00:05:44.790> I<00:05:44.940> think<00:05:45.150> that<00:05:45.270> looks<00:05:45.420> lovely<00:05:49.340> when<00:05:50.340> after

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
all I think that looks lovely when after

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.630 
all I think that looks lovely when after
that's<00:05:51.330> dried<00:05:51.780> I<00:05:52.200> like<00:05:52.560> to<00:05:52.680> let<00:05:52.830> it<00:05:52.950> dry<00:05:53.250> before

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:53.640 
that's dried I like to let it dry before

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.360 
that's dried I like to let it dry before
I<00:05:53.700> actually<00:05:53.940> do<00:05:54.330> anything<00:05:54.570> with<00:05:54.810> the<00:05:55.380> rock

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
I actually do anything with the rock

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.100 
I actually do anything with the rock
after<00:05:56.580> I've<00:05:56.820> written<00:05:57.030> on<00:05:57.330> it<00:05:57.570> but<00:05:57.690> the<00:05:57.870> other

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
after I've written on it but the other

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.590 
after I've written on it but the other
ones<00:05:58.410> that<00:05:58.590> I've<00:05:58.800> done<00:05:59.040> before<00:05:59.310> that<00:06:00.030> I<00:06:00.210> had<00:06:00.570> a

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 
ones that I've done before that I had a

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.010 
ones that I've done before that I had a
picture<00:06:01.140> let's<00:06:01.650> see<00:06:02.250> this<00:06:03.030> one<00:06:03.390> this<00:06:03.600> one<00:06:03.810> it's

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
picture let's see this one this one it's

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.530 
picture let's see this one this one it's
a<00:06:04.140> seek<00:06:04.380> magic<00:06:04.890> what<00:06:05.820> I'm<00:06:05.910> going<00:06:06.090> to<00:06:06.180> do<00:06:06.270> is<00:06:06.420> I'm

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:06.540 
a seek magic what I'm going to do is I'm

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:15.320 
a seek magic what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:06:06.720> to<00:06:06.810> put<00:06:07.080> a<00:06:13.190> layer<00:06:14.190> of<00:06:14.400> Mod<00:06:14.610> Podge<00:06:14.910> on<00:06:15.150> it

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.330 
going to put a layer of Mod Podge on it

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.600 
going to put a layer of Mod Podge on it
that's<00:06:15.600> much<00:06:15.840> Podge<00:06:16.140> um<00:06:16.530> you<00:06:17.010> could<00:06:17.160> use<00:06:17.340> gel

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
that's much Podge um you could use gel

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.130 
that's much Podge um you could use gel
medium<00:06:17.970> if<00:06:18.060> you<00:06:18.180> want<00:06:18.390> much<00:06:18.660> much<00:06:18.930> it's

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:19.140 
medium if you want much much it's

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.800 
medium if you want much much it's
cheaper<00:06:19.470> to<00:06:19.500> use<00:06:19.620> that<00:06:19.920> so<00:06:20.160> that's<00:06:20.310> what<00:06:20.460> I<00:06:20.490> use

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:20.810 
cheaper to use that so that's what I use

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:28.460 
cheaper to use that so that's what I use
okay<00:06:21.810> and<00:06:22.560> I'll<00:06:22.740> just<00:06:24.050> paint<00:06:25.050> over<00:06:25.230> it<00:06:27.470> looks

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:28.470 
okay and I'll just paint over it looks

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:30.230 
okay and I'll just paint over it looks
white<00:06:28.710> when<00:06:28.950> it<00:06:28.980> goes<00:06:29.220> on<00:06:29.460> but<00:06:29.730> it<00:06:29.850> will<00:06:29.940> dry

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
white when it goes on but it will dry

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.120 
white when it goes on but it will dry
clear

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.130 
clear

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.580 
clear
depending<00:06:32.910> on<00:06:32.970> how<00:06:33.180> glossy<00:06:33.570> you<00:06:34.140> want<00:06:34.350> it<00:06:34.440> to

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:34.590 
depending on how glossy you want it to

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:37.610 
depending on how glossy you want it to
look<00:06:35.720> you<00:06:36.720> might<00:06:36.870> want<00:06:37.020> to<00:06:37.050> put<00:06:37.200> another<00:06:37.380> coat

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:37.620 
look you might want to put another coat

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.520 
look you might want to put another coat
on<00:06:38.000> but<00:06:39.000> once<00:06:39.210> again<00:06:39.390> you<00:06:39.750> can<00:06:39.900> only<00:06:39.960> do<00:06:40.230> one

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:40.530 
on but once again you can only do one

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:48.700 
on but once again you can only do one
side<00:06:40.890> at<00:06:40.950> a<00:06:41.220> time

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:48.710 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.339 

of<00:06:49.710> course<00:06:50.039> I<00:06:50.189> have<00:06:50.490> gotten<00:06:51.030> I<00:06:51.270> believe<00:06:52.080> I<00:06:52.169> have

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:52.349 
of course I have gotten I believe I have

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:55.640 
of course I have gotten I believe I have
them<00:06:53.000> March<00:06:54.000> pods<00:06:54.300> gloss<00:06:54.750> cluster<00:06:55.379> you<00:06:55.530> can

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:55.650 
them March pods gloss cluster you can

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.219 
them March pods gloss cluster you can
also<00:06:55.800> get<00:06:56.069> a<00:06:56.099> matte<00:06:56.400> version<00:06:56.759> of<00:06:57.060> that<00:06:57.270> but<00:06:58.080> you

00:06:58.219 --> 00:06:58.229 
also get a matte version of that but you

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:00.230 
also get a matte version of that but you
know<00:06:58.349> the<00:06:58.500> idea<00:06:58.530> is<00:06:59.159> to<00:06:59.340> make<00:06:59.460> it<00:06:59.520> look<00:06:59.639> a<00:07:00.030> rock

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 
know the idea is to make it look a rock

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.649 
know the idea is to make it look a rock
look<00:07:00.449> a<00:07:00.539> little<00:07:00.750> glossy<00:07:00.960> or<00:07:01.259> so<00:07:02.659> there's

00:07:03.649 --> 00:07:03.659 
look a little glossy or so there's

00:07:03.659 --> 00:07:04.399 
look a little glossy or so there's
another<00:07:03.900> one

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:04.409 
another one

00:07:04.409 --> 00:07:09.140 
another one
so<00:07:05.250> you<00:07:05.310> just<00:07:05.490> cover<00:07:05.759> that<00:07:05.849> let<00:07:06.330> it<00:07:06.449> dry<00:07:08.150> decide

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:09.150 
so you just cover that let it dry decide

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:10.490 
so you just cover that let it dry decide
whether<00:07:09.360> you<00:07:09.509> want<00:07:09.689> to<00:07:09.750> do<00:07:09.900> it<00:07:10.020> again<00:07:10.110> and<00:07:10.409> then

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:10.500 
whether you want to do it again and then

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.890 
whether you want to do it again and then
you're<00:07:10.680> done<00:07:10.939> so<00:07:11.939> it's<00:07:12.090> fairly<00:07:12.360> simple<00:07:12.750> to

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:12.900 
you're done so it's fairly simple to

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.749 
you're done so it's fairly simple to
make<00:07:13.169> these<00:07:13.349> rocks<00:07:13.560> you<00:07:13.860> can<00:07:14.009> put<00:07:14.189> any<00:07:14.400> kind<00:07:14.639> of

00:07:14.749 --> 00:07:14.759 
make these rocks you can put any kind of

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:17.119 
make these rocks you can put any kind of
things<00:07:15.000> you<00:07:15.240> want<00:07:15.419> on<00:07:15.719> them<00:07:15.960> sometimes<00:07:16.949> I've

00:07:17.119 --> 00:07:17.129 
things you want on them sometimes I've

00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:22.390 
things you want on them sometimes I've
done<00:07:17.340> words<00:07:17.610> sometimes<00:07:18.060> I've<00:07:18.419> done<00:07:18.569> sentences

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:22.400 

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.279 

see<00:07:23.400> like<00:07:23.819> be<00:07:24.060> gentle<00:07:24.449> with<00:07:24.569> yourself<00:07:24.659> I<00:07:25.080> did

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:25.289 
see like be gentle with yourself I did
