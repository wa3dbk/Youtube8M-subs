00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.480
 the prÃ¶ll a diesel particulate filter 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.400
 cleaner from liqui moly is one 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.670
 highly effective cost-saving 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.680
 cleaning fluid car diesel 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.080
 Particle filters can thus be used in 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.570
 built-in condition with low 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.820
 time thoroughly from typical 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.120
 Pollution and deposits freed 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.010
 become 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.379
 depending on the vehicle type is an access 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.809
 to produce the diesel particulate filter 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:44.820
 when cleaning a temperature 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:47.010
 below 40 degrees required with the 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.250
 Specially developed cleaning set 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.680
 consisting of cleansing rinse pressure 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.260
 mug gun and probe can the 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.260
 Particle filter fast and without big 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.620
 effort directly on the vehicle cleaned 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.620
 become 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:06.090
 fill diesel particulate filter cleaner 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:10.470
 from liqui moly in the pressure of which 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:13.170
 pistol screw the pressure cup 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.970
 pistol and connect it with 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.750
 the spray probe and the 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.750
 compressed air hose 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:26.070
 spray probe straight or angled each 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.840
 after accessibility to the particulate filter 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.819
 choose 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.759
 Lead the spray probe with the hole 

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:35.399
 and the attacking nose so in 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.939
 the particle filter that both in 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:42.240
 Direction of the exhaust flow show as well 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.130
 shown in our model composition 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.920
 spray the complete amount 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.350
 cleaning fluid in several short 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.380
 intervals of five to ten 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.750
 seconds at a working pressure of 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.619
 at least six to eight bar directly in 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.450
 exhaust gas flow direction into the filter 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.970
 move the probe a bit 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.899
 and hence the whole particle filter 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:09.319
 is detected by the liquid 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:13.290
 leave the cleaner for about 15 minutes 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:15.720
 act on the fill 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.799
 Diesel Particle Filter Flushing Liquids 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:22.019
 Complete moly in the pressure cup 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:25.170
 you like this with the cleaner 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:27.959
 pressure mug gun spray probe and 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.269
 Air hose flush the 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:35.250
 Particulate filter with the entire amount 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:37.110
 rinsing liquid after they close 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.290
 then the access to the diesel 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.000
 Particle filters bring back that 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.220
 vehicle idling on 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.260
 operating temperatur 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.049
 the solved by the cleaning process 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.870
 russ is distributed in the particle filter like this 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.480
 that he has a regeneration 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.910
 can be burned off 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.609
 after warming up the engine must be a 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.910
 Regeneration according to manufacturer specifications 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:04.400
 to be triggered 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.440
 the prÃ¶ll a diesel particulate filter 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.709
 cleaner ensures optimal driving behavior 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.690
 high engine power and low 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:17.480
 fuel consumption at all 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.480
 closed car diesel particulate filters 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:26.430
