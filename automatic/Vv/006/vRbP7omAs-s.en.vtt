metal piece on top of this sample to get

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.480 
metal piece on top of this sample to get
the<00:01:33.420> most<00:01:33.630> length<00:01:33.930> out<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.409> if<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:35.250> top

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
the most length out of it if the top

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.370 
the most length out of it if the top
piece<00:01:35.729> is<00:01:35.759> too<00:01:36.150> tight<00:01:36.420> then<00:01:36.900> use<00:01:37.049> some<00:01:37.200> pliers

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
piece is too tight then use some pliers

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.859 
piece is too tight then use some pliers
to<00:01:37.740> loosen<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:38.189> we<00:01:39.000> didn't<00:01:39.329> do<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.570> for<00:01:39.750> this

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
to loosen it we didn't do it for this

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.929 
to loosen it we didn't do it for this
tutorial<00:01:40.110> but<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.070> recommended<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.759> you
