00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
exciting we have this Google Sketchup

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.660 
exciting we have this Google Sketchup
model<00:00:09.750> right<00:00:09.840> here<00:00:09.900> and<00:00:10.889> we're<00:00:11.309> going<00:00:11.490> to<00:00:11.549> make

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
model right here and we're going to make

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.060 
model right here and we're going to make
it<00:00:11.790> photorealistic<00:00:12.559> now<00:00:13.559> this<00:00:13.769> is<00:00:13.860> not<00:00:13.980> an

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
it photorealistic now this is not an

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.339 
it photorealistic now this is not an
easy<00:00:14.219> task<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.700> do<00:00:14.940> with<00:00:15.179> Google<00:00:15.719> Sketchup<00:00:15.960> so

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:16.349 
easy task to do with Google Sketchup so

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:17.720 
easy task to do with Google Sketchup so
we'll<00:00:16.560> need<00:00:16.680> some<00:00:16.950> help<00:00:17.160> from<00:00:17.369> some<00:00:17.610> other

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
we'll need some help from some other

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.929 
we'll need some help from some other
free<00:00:18.240> software<00:00:18.689> available<00:00:18.720> on<00:00:19.200> the<00:00:19.290> Internet

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
free software available on the Internet

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.230 
free software available on the Internet
ok<00:00:20.939> so<00:00:21.000> here<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:21.570> have<00:00:22.039> sort<00:00:23.039> of<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.279> stage<00:00:23.910> I've

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
ok so here I have sort of a stage I've

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.509 
ok so here I have sort of a stage I've
just<00:00:24.449> built<00:00:24.660> for<00:00:25.109> my<00:00:25.529> school<00:00:25.800> actually<00:00:26.189> but<00:00:26.310> in

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
just built for my school actually but in

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.730 
just built for my school actually but in
any<00:00:26.640> case<00:00:26.880> just<00:00:27.180> stage<00:00:27.660> textured<00:00:28.289> fairly

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
any case just stage textured fairly

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.429 
any case just stage textured fairly
simply<00:00:29.539> so<00:00:30.539> once<00:00:30.810> you<00:00:30.900> have<00:00:30.960> your<00:00:31.109> model<00:00:31.230> done

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
simply so once you have your model done

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.570 
simply so once you have your model done
it<00:00:31.560> doesn't<00:00:31.769> have<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:31.920> be<00:00:32.010> the<00:00:32.099> stage<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.460> could

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:32.580 
it doesn't have to be the stage it could

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.850 
it doesn't have to be the stage it could
be<00:00:32.669> anything<00:00:32.989> go<00:00:33.989> ahead<00:00:34.199> and<00:00:34.350> save<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:34.739> and

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
be anything go ahead and save it and

and you should notice if it sold
correctly<00:01:37.090> that<00:01:37.720> under<00:01:38.050> the<00:01:38.170> plugins<00:01:38.619> you<00:01:38.800> now

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
correctly that under the plugins you now

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.109 
correctly that under the plugins you now
have<00:01:39.100> a<00:01:39.130> kirk<00:01:39.520> Athiya<00:01:39.850> exporter<00:01:41.190> option<00:01:42.190> now

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
have a kirk Athiya exporter option now

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:44.820 
have a kirk Athiya exporter option now
basically<00:01:43.360> what<00:01:43.630> this<00:01:43.780> can<00:01:44.080> do<00:01:44.259> is<00:01:44.289> it's<00:01:44.649> gonna

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
basically what this can do is it's gonna

basically what this can do is it's gonna
export<00:01:45.700> your<00:01:45.820> model<00:01:46.000> as<00:01:46.270> an<00:01:46.390> XML<00:01:46.899> file<00:01:47.259> which

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
export your model as an XML file which

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.260 
export your model as an XML file which
is<00:01:47.679> something<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:48.130> Kirk<00:01:48.430> Athiya<00:01:48.729> application

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
is something the Kirk Athiya application

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.179 
is something the Kirk Athiya application
can<00:01:49.479> read<00:01:49.659> now<00:01:50.259> the<00:01:50.320> easiest<00:01:50.680> way<00:01:50.770> to<00:01:50.860> do<00:01:51.100> is

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.240 
now one cooker Theater's first opens you
will<00:02:45.620> notice<00:02:45.980> that<00:02:47.470> it's<00:02:48.470> a<00:02:49.630> wireframe<00:02:50.630> and

sort of blue box going around your model

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.560 
sort of blue box going around your model
this<00:02:56.480> is<00:02:56.600> a<00:02:56.630> set<00:02:56.900> it<00:02:57.050> should<00:02:57.290> like<00:02:57.830> the<00:02:58.570> viewer

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
this is a set it should like the viewer

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.750 
this is a set it should like the viewer
of<00:02:59.840> a<00:02:59.959> camera<00:03:00.350> of<00:03:00.500> Sketchup<00:03:00.830> if<00:03:01.430> you<00:03:01.550> right

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760

click on your mouse you can pan and zoom
in<00:03:04.310> zoom<00:03:04.489> out<00:03:04.910> again<00:03:05.830> but<00:03:06.830> I'm<00:03:07.310> just<00:03:07.550> gonna<00:03:07.640> set

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
in zoom out again but I'm just gonna set

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:50.630 
in zoom out again but I'm just gonna set
up<00:03:08.090> my<00:03:08.270> angle<00:03:08.840> until<00:03:08.989> I'm<00:03:09.230> happy<00:03:09.770> with<00:03:09.860> it<00:03:10.010> here

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.400 

there<00:03:51.640> we<00:03:51.790> go<00:03:51.940> so<00:03:52.150> here<00:03:52.390> I've<00:03:52.510> set<00:03:52.840> up<00:03:52.870> my<00:03:52.990> model

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
there we go so here I've set up my model

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.350 
there we go so here I've set up my model
from<00:03:54.370> the<00:03:54.520> globe<00:03:54.790> we<00:03:54.880> should<00:03:55.030> take<00:03:55.150> a<00:03:55.210> picture

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
from the globe we should take a picture

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.570 
from the globe we should take a picture
now<00:03:56.230> the<00:03:56.950> next<00:03:57.280> step<00:03:57.490> is<00:03:58.020> to<00:03:59.020> go<00:03:59.440> render<00:03:59.920> here

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
now the next step is to go render here

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.960 
now the next step is to go render here
and<00:04:01.000> setup<00:04:02.250> now<00:04:03.250> you'll<00:04:03.460> probably<00:04:03.580> want<00:04:03.910> to

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
and setup now you'll probably want to

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.850 
and setup now you'll probably want to
leave<00:04:04.150> this<00:04:04.390> the<00:04:04.720> way<00:04:04.810> it<00:04:04.930> is<00:04:05.020> initially<00:04:05.710> but

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
leave this the way it is initially but

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.680 
leave this the way it is initially but
it's<00:04:06.010> good<00:04:06.640> showing<00:04:06.970> you<00:04:07.090> this<00:04:07.270> just<00:04:07.480> for<00:04:07.630> a

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
it's good showing you this just for a

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.380 
it's good showing you this just for a
future<00:04:08.050> reference<00:04:09.030> production<00:04:10.030> a<00:04:10.180> is

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
future reference production a is

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.260 
future reference production a is
probably<00:04:10.780> what<00:04:10.960> you<00:04:11.050> want<00:04:11.170> to<00:04:11.290> go<00:04:11.380> with<00:04:12.270> and

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
probably what you want to go with and

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
probably what you want to go with and
then<00:04:14.080> hit<00:04:14.760> start<00:04:15.760> render<00:04:16.180> now<00:04:16.720> you'll<00:04:17.049> come<00:04:17.260> up

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
then hit start render now you'll come up

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.310 
then hit start render now you'll come up
with<00:04:17.380> something<00:04:17.500> like<00:04:17.799> this<00:04:19.260> there<00:04:20.260> are

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
with something like this there are

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.430 
with something like this there are
different<00:04:20.350> types<00:04:20.709> of<00:04:20.799> renders<00:04:21.160> you<00:04:21.280> can<00:04:21.459> do<00:04:22.440> so

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
different types of renders you can do so

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.740 
different types of renders you can do so
if<00:04:23.590> you<00:04:23.710> hit<00:04:23.950> settings<00:04:24.540> we<00:04:25.540> will<00:04:25.570> go<00:04:25.960> with

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
if you hit settings we will go with

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.920 
if you hit settings we will go with
photon<00:04:28.750> map<00:04:30.030> hi<00:04:31.060> now<00:04:31.360> this<00:04:31.540> will<00:04:31.660> just<00:04:31.780> give

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
photon map hi now this will just give

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:38.400 
photon map hi now this will just give
you<00:04:32.080> a<00:04:32.670> realistic<00:04:36.150> sort<00:04:37.150> of<00:04:37.270> you<00:04:37.540> know<00:04:37.750> just

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
you a realistic sort of you know just

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.030 
you a realistic sort of you know just
hit<00:04:38.530> apply<00:04:39.600> and<00:04:40.600> yes<00:04:41.110> to<00:04:41.410> save<00:04:41.620> my<00:04:41.800> changes

hit apply and yes to save my changes

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.550 
hit apply and yes to save my changes
there<00:04:42.430> I'd<00:04:43.300> hit<00:04:43.480> okay<00:04:45.960> now<00:04:46.960> you'll<00:04:47.290> notice

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
there I'd hit okay now you'll notice

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.080 
there I'd hit okay now you'll notice
that<00:04:47.770> at<00:04:47.920> the<00:04:48.040> bottom<00:04:48.070> there'll<00:04:48.520> be<00:04:48.550> a<00:04:48.640> counter

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
that at the bottom there'll be a counter

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.370 
that at the bottom there'll be a counter
saying<00:04:49.330> how<00:04:49.450> much<00:04:49.600> time<00:04:49.750> has<00:04:49.870> elapsed<00:04:51.210> and

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
saying how much time has elapsed and

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.270 
saying how much time has elapsed and
eventually<00:04:53.380> you'll<00:04:53.530> get<00:04:53.650> to<00:04:53.740> see<00:04:53.890> the<00:04:54.010> image

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
eventually you'll get to see the image

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.070 
eventually you'll get to see the image
once<00:04:54.580> it<00:04:54.790> is<00:04:54.880> complete<00:04:55.330> if<00:04:55.480> you<00:04:55.570> look<00:04:55.750> quick
