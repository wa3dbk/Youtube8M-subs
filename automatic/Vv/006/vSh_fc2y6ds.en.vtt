unique animals we've been around on

unique animals we've been around on
earth<00:00:17.670> for<00:00:17.970> over<00:00:18.410> 225<00:00:19.410> million<00:00:19.710> years<00:00:20.010> but

earth for over 225 million years but
their<00:00:20.850> closest<00:00:21.240> relatives<00:00:21.689> died<00:00:21.930> out<00:00:22.140> at<00:00:22.320> the

time of the dinosaurs over 60 million
years<00:00:24.359> ago<00:00:24.510> so<00:00:25.410> when<00:00:25.590> scientists<00:00:26.099> first

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
years ago so when scientists first

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.740 
years ago so when scientists first
discovered<00:00:26.820> them<00:00:26.939> they<00:00:27.150> thought<00:00:27.359> of<00:00:27.539> course

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
discovered them they thought of course

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.509 
discovered them they thought of course
that<00:00:27.840> they<00:00:28.019> were<00:00:28.080> lizards<00:00:28.470> but<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.250> wasn't

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
that they were lizards but it wasn't

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:30.950 
that they were lizards but it wasn't
long<00:00:29.699> before<00:00:29.730> they<00:00:30.150> realize<00:00:30.359> that<00:00:30.570> there's

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
long before they realize that there's

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.179 
long before they realize that there's
quite<00:00:31.199> important<00:00:31.679> differences<00:00:32.130> between

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
quite important differences between

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.760 
quite important differences between
tuatara<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.390> lizards<00:00:33.690> there's<00:00:34.050> so<00:00:34.380> much<00:00:34.530> so

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
tuatara and lizards there's so much so

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.170 
tuatara and lizards there's so much so
that<00:00:34.800> they've<00:00:35.070> put<00:00:35.280> them<00:00:35.430> as<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.790> only

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
that they've put them as the only

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.950 
that they've put them as the only
species<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.960> their<00:00:37.140> order<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.620> reptiles<00:00:38.960> so

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
species and their order of reptiles so

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:40.940 
species and their order of reptiles so
some<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.320> things<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.590> make<00:00:40.800> them

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
some of the things that make them

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.340 
some of the things that make them
different<00:00:41.570> include<00:00:42.570> things<00:00:42.780> like<00:00:42.930> having

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
different include things like having

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.590 
different include things like having
extra<00:00:43.649> holes<00:00:43.920> in<00:00:44.129> their<00:00:44.280> skulls<00:00:44.430> their<00:00:45.329> ribs

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
extra holes in their skulls their ribs

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.389 
extra holes in their skulls their ribs
are<00:00:45.809> different<00:00:46.200> they<00:00:46.950> don't<00:00:47.070> have<00:00:47.280> any

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
are different they don't have any

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.360 
are different they don't have any
external<00:00:47.730> eardrums<00:00:48.360> like<00:00:48.629> lizards<00:00:48.989> do<00:00:49.340> but<00:00:50.340> I

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
external eardrums like lizards do but I

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.229 
external eardrums like lizards do but I
think<00:00:50.579> one<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.789> most<00:00:50.940> interesting

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
think one of the most interesting

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.840 
think one of the most interesting
differences<00:00:51.899> is<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.260> tuatara<00:00:53.160> are<00:00:53.520> born

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
differences is that tuatara are born

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.510 
differences is that tuatara are born
with<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.180> third<00:00:54.539> eye<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:55.770> it's<00:00:56.129> only<00:00:56.280> visible

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
with a third eye so it's only visible

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.979 
with a third eye so it's only visible
when<00:00:56.789> they're<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.090> little<00:00:57.390> wee<00:00:57.510> baby<00:00:57.750> as<00:00:57.960> a

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
when they're a little wee baby as a

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.720 
when they're a little wee baby as a
hatchling<00:00:58.289> there's<00:00:58.739> little<00:00:59.219> translucent

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
hatchling there's little translucent

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.520 
hatchling there's little translucent
patch<00:01:00.149> at<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.449> top<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.750> their<00:01:00.840> forehead<00:01:01.260> here

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
patch at the top of their forehead here

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.260 
patch at the top of their forehead here
and<00:01:01.949> once<00:01:02.160> they're<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.370> few<00:01:02.579> months<00:01:02.879> old<00:01:03.090> that

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
and once they're a few months old that

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.119 
and once they're a few months old that
the<00:01:03.750> scales<00:01:04.049> grow<00:01:04.350> over<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.739> eye<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.040> you

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
the scales grow over the eye and you

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.859 
the scales grow over the eye and you
can't<00:01:05.339> see<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.670> anymore<00:01:05.850> it's<00:01:06.630> quite

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
can't see it anymore it's quite

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.600 
can't see it anymore it's quite
sophisticated<00:01:07.170> it's<00:01:07.799> got<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.040> lens<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.580> a

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
sophisticated it's got a lens and a

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.640 
sophisticated it's got a lens and a
retina<00:01:08.970> but<00:01:09.210> it's<00:01:09.330> not<00:01:09.479> used<00:01:09.750> for<00:01:09.930> seeing<00:01:10.439> and

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
retina but it's not used for seeing and

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.200 
retina but it's not used for seeing and
they<00:01:11.010> think<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.520> might<00:01:11.729> be<00:01:12.000> they're<00:01:12.180> not

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
they think that it might be they're not

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.390 
they think that it might be they're not
exactly<00:01:12.600> sure<00:01:12.810> what<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.140> used<00:01:13.470> for<00:01:13.590> but

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
exactly sure what it is used for but

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.210 
exactly sure what it is used for but
they<00:01:14.520> think<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.150> might<00:01:15.330> be<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.600> do<00:01:15.720> with

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
they think that it might be to do with

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.320 
they think that it might be to do with
differentiating<00:01:17.220> between<00:01:17.340> light<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:17.909> dark

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
differentiating between light and dark

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.560 
differentiating between light and dark
cycles<00:01:18.960> or<00:01:19.259> maybe<00:01:19.500> for<00:01:19.860> absorbing<00:01:20.369> UV<00:01:20.970> light

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
cycles or maybe for absorbing UV light

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.990 
cycles or maybe for absorbing UV light
because<00:01:21.990> they<00:01:22.439> are<00:01:22.500> nocturnal<00:01:22.979> animals<00:01:23.460> but

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
because they are nocturnal animals but

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.210 
because they are nocturnal animals but
we<00:01:24.240> they<00:01:24.450> do<00:01:24.509> require<00:01:24.780> UV<00:01:25.439> so<00:01:25.650> they<00:01:25.770> bask<00:01:26.009> in

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
we they do require UV so they bask in

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.850 
we they do require UV so they bask in
the<00:01:26.340> daylight<00:01:26.750> tuatara<00:01:27.750> is<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.350> maori<00:01:28.680> word

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
the daylight tuatara is the maori word

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.830 
the daylight tuatara is the maori word
meaning<00:01:29.280> spines<00:01:29.700> on<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.030> back<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.509> that

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
meaning spines on the back and that

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.330 
meaning spines on the back and that
relates<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.350> this<00:01:31.470> crease<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:32.009> they<00:01:32.130> have

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
relates to this crease that they have

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.710 
relates to this crease that they have
running<00:01:32.520> down<00:01:32.759> their<00:01:32.970> head<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.420> their<00:01:33.570> back

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
running down their head and their back

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.289 
running down their head and their back
it's<00:01:34.590> larger<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.610> male's<00:01:35.850> this<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.270> a

enclosure that with a new roof that
opens<00:02:56.580> and<00:02:57.030> closes<00:02:57.060> so<00:02:57.630> we're<00:02:57.780> able<00:02:57.900> to<00:02:58.200> give

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
opens and closes so we're able to give

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.310 
opens and closes so we're able to give
them<00:02:58.560> extra<00:02:58.770> UV<00:02:59.340> light<00:02:59.640> when<00:03:00.600> they<00:03:00.720> require<00:03:01.080> it

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
them extra UV light when they require it

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.630 
them extra UV light when they require it
and<00:03:01.500> then<00:03:01.590> we're<00:03:01.740> able<00:03:01.800> to<00:03:01.950> close<00:03:02.160> that<00:03:02.190> down<00:03:02.580> a

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
and then we're able to close that down a

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.360 
and then we're able to close that down a
farm<00:03:03.210> that's<00:03:03.540> too<00:03:04.140> much<00:03:04.260> rain<00:03:04.560> or<00:03:04.830> just<00:03:05.190> too
