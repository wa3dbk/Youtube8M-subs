00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
and the buffalo chicken would probably

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.199 
and the buffalo chicken would probably
go<00:02:11.280> pretty<00:02:11.580> well<00:02:11.760> together

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209

salad instead of french fries on here

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.129 
salad instead of french fries on here
although<00:03:09.180> I<00:03:09.269> didn't<00:03:09.480> really<00:03:09.629> eat<00:03:09.750> that<00:03:09.930> side

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:10.139

although I didn't really eat that side
salad<00:03:10.560> it<00:03:10.680> didn't<00:03:10.950> really<00:03:11.099> taste<00:03:11.310> too<00:03:11.519> great

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
salad it didn't really taste too great

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.550 
salad it didn't really taste too great
as<00:03:11.939> well<00:03:12.299> as<00:03:12.480> I'm<00:03:12.750> not<00:03:12.870> really<00:03:12.989> a<00:03:13.109> big<00:03:13.319> fan<00:03:13.530> of

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
as well as I'm not really a big fan of

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.440 
as well as I'm not really a big fan of
croutons<00:03:13.889> as<00:03:14.310> is<00:03:14.519> but<00:03:15.090> as<00:03:15.180> far<00:03:15.299> as<00:03:15.329> the

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
croutons as is but as far as the

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.059 
croutons as is but as far as the
sandwich<00:03:15.780> goes<00:03:16.019> all<00:03:16.319> it<00:03:16.470> really<00:03:16.560> had<00:03:16.829> was<00:03:17.040> a

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
sandwich goes all it really had was a

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.610 
sandwich goes all it really had was a
big<00:03:17.489> piece<00:03:17.760> of<00:03:17.790> chicken<00:03:18.120> breast<00:03:18.510> some<00:03:19.230> Swiss

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
big piece of chicken breast some Swiss

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.699 
big piece of chicken breast some Swiss
cheese<00:03:19.919> some<00:03:20.879> bacon<00:03:21.359> and<00:03:21.389> some<00:03:21.629> mustard<00:03:22.169> so<00:03:22.560> it

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
cheese some bacon and some mustard so it

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.289 
cheese some bacon and some mustard so it
wasn't<00:03:22.980> really<00:03:23.160> too<00:03:23.370> bad<00:03:23.549> in<00:03:23.730> my<00:03:23.819> opinion<00:03:24.209> you

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
wasn't really too bad in my opinion you

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.629 
wasn't really too bad in my opinion you
see<00:03:24.480> it's<00:03:24.599> on<00:03:24.750> bread<00:03:25.109> as<00:03:25.290> well<00:03:25.560> for<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.280> macros

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
see it's on bread as well for the macros

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.640 
see it's on bread as well for the macros
on<00:03:26.790> this<00:03:27.030> I<00:03:27.180> guesstimated<00:03:28.109> it<00:03:28.230> and<00:03:28.410> when<00:03:28.620> I

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
on this I guesstimated it and when I

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.490 
on this I guesstimated it and when I
guesstimate<00:03:29.489> when<00:03:29.699> I<00:03:29.730> go<00:03:30.030> out<00:03:30.180> and<00:03:30.359> eat<00:03:30.930> I<00:03:31.109> tend

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
guesstimate when I go out and eat I tend

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.500 
guesstimate when I go out and eat I tend
to<00:03:31.560> overestimate<00:03:32.069> only<00:03:32.699> because<00:03:33.030> I<00:03:33.060> want<00:03:33.449> to

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
to overestimate only because I want to

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.420 
to overestimate only because I want to
make<00:03:33.690> sure<00:03:33.739> that<00:03:34.739> I'm<00:03:34.889> going<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.099> be<00:03:35.220> able<00:03:35.310> to

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
make sure that I'm going to be able to

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.740 
make sure that I'm going to be able to
fall<00:03:35.639> within<00:03:35.790> my<00:03:35.909> numbers<00:03:36.269> and<00:03:36.419> often<00:03:36.599> times

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
fall within my numbers and often times

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.030 
fall within my numbers and often times
you<00:03:36.810> can't<00:03:37.049> really<00:03:37.199> tell<00:03:37.409> what<00:03:37.650> they<00:03:37.769> cook

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
you can't really tell what they cook

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.649 
you can't really tell what they cook
with<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:38.790> cheese<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:39.269> bacon<00:03:39.449> here

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:39.659 
with the cheese and bacon here

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:41.240 
with the cheese and bacon here
definitely<00:03:39.780> adds<00:03:40.109> some<00:03:40.230> fat<00:03:40.560> but<00:03:40.859> for<00:03:41.190> the

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
definitely adds some fat but for the

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.159 
definitely adds some fat but for the
most<00:03:41.400> part<00:03:41.639> just<00:03:41.669> a<00:03:41.909> chicken<00:03:42.209> sandwich<00:03:42.449> so<00:03:42.720> 26

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169 
most part just a chicken sandwich so 26

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:44.869 
most part just a chicken sandwich so 26
grams<00:03:43.319> of<00:03:43.500> fat<00:03:43.650> is<00:03:43.829> probably<00:03:44.489> a<00:03:44.549> little<00:03:44.760> bit

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 
grams of fat is probably a little bit

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:47.119 
grams of fat is probably a little bit
high<00:03:45.030> but<00:03:45.629> again<00:03:45.930> I<00:03:46.079> wanted<00:03:46.440> to<00:03:46.530> be<00:03:46.650> safe<00:03:46.889> okay

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
high but again I wanted to be safe okay

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:49.939 
high but again I wanted to be safe okay
so<00:03:48.030> let's<00:03:48.359> take<00:03:48.510> a<00:03:48.569> look<00:03:48.810> at<00:03:48.989> the<00:03:49.199> day<00:03:49.440> in<00:03:49.680> total

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:49.949 
so let's take a look at the day in total

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:52.849 
so let's take a look at the day in total

protein 65 grams of fat for a total just
over<00:03:55.979> 3,400<00:03:56.909> calories<00:03:57.449> now<00:03:57.659> how<00:03:58.049> did<00:03:58.199> I

00:03:58.219 --> 00:03:58.229 
over 3,400 calories now how did I

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:00.379 
over 3,400 calories now how did I
actually<00:03:58.440> do<00:03:58.799> well<00:03:59.370> I<00:03:59.400> fell<00:03:59.760> pretty<00:04:00.030> short<00:04:00.299> of

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
actually do well I fell pretty short of

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:03.920 
actually do well I fell pretty short of
my<00:04:00.479> carb<00:04:00.780> goal<00:04:00.989> of<00:04:01.280> 381<00:04:02.280> however<00:04:03.180> I<00:04:03.269> did<00:04:03.599> exceed

about this however again because I ate
out<00:04:19.349> I<00:04:19.380> wasn't<00:04:19.919> necessarily<00:04:20.070> sure<00:04:20.699> if<00:04:20.909> that
