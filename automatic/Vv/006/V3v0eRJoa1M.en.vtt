00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 and then with that we will be able to do 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:09.710
 our little one as our name is called 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.710
 little golem of the road 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.210
 with youtube friends we are here 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.810
 recording a super video and then 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.400
 welcome to my series that is called how 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.590
 it was called what the series is called or if 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.440
 I remembered it's called training for 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.110
 0.12 and what is this 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.920
 super series consists of going training in 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.870
 to be learning to graphite in 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.239
 in this new method that is from minecraft 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.159
 because remember that tommaso showed us 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.769
 several several videos that is already going to 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:52.539
 graphite like in minecraft that's not and 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:55.000
 Well let's learn some people 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:57.940
 they asked me on facebook how 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.219
 graphite several objects 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.440
 remember that several objects already know 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.229
 you are easy but there are others that 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.570
 They are new as the enchantments table 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.640
 the potions table several things that go 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.340
 to add and do not know how to graph and 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:16.690
 Well, let's say 20 days to go 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:20.500
 leave the bed this version at 0.12 and 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.810
 it leaves 10 on July 29 is not well 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.210
 then in total there will be 20 chapters 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.890
 of this series until it comes out and then 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.959
 and we rebiÃ©n worse is I want 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.000
 talk about this first today we are going to 

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:33.009
 as tested at block graphed 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.250
 iron and how to make the iron golem 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:38.770
 that either 100% for the 0.12 and the golem 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.509
 of snow that I am affirming right now 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.299
 which is like 50 percent of that 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.729
 let's say at 0.12 but all 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:47.930
 let's learn how to do it first 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.780
 we need 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.180
 this week like iron bullion 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.290
 iron snowballs to make this 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.820
 let's say blocks of snow 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.130
 we need a pumpkin 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:02.000
 found in any type of biome and 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.700
 etc. etc. etc. and then we 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.660
 to go to our tea coffee table or 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.550
 remember that this graffiti I'm going to 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.289
 be like minecraft or the 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.120
 minecraft and here is going to plot with a 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.959
 main cup s so get used to or 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.270
 we are not going to grab in our ingots 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:21.070
 and we are going to accommodate them in such a way 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.070
 to fill all the spaces 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.910
 and so we're going to have a block 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.480
 let's make it the same method for 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.480
 have 2 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.520
 and we already have the blocks that go but in 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.470
 total we need I think one two three 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.680
 four blocks to do something read from 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.800
 iron inclusive is very let's say that very 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.750
 this is very expensive this this small but 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.430
 well that will defend us so let's go 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.430
 to continue building the 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.610
 and it is already 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.700
 we have four blocks we have an extra 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.340
 iron ingot let's store it and 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.140
 because with that we will be able to do 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.770
 our little one as our name is called 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.510
 little golem from yesterday's road and 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.690
 now with this we will do the same 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:22.360
 but the snow golem of the werder of 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.250
 snow and it's a little bit a little less expensive 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.760
 but it does not last almost nothing so we're going to 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.760
 graph what 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:33.600
 has done here is look is not so expensive 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.070
 of what is said to be very expensive or is it 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.370
 very easy to jokes that you are 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:41.700
 in a biome of snow and already with the soul and 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.110
 then first let's get closer to that 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.820
 slide 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.280
 remember that I am on board white a 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:50.820
 application for stopping that allows us 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.130
 run this android when I heard that we 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.870
 allows you to adjust pc minecraft and to 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.450
 make us to our goal based on 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.610
 the 0.12 let's make one is a type t 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.650
 that everyone already knows but anyway 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.360
 for those people who do not know the truth is 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.640
 that there are many people who are very not for 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:11.120
 that is , I did not disrespect 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:11.120
 but you do not know, we're going to go down here 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.440
 let's put this here 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.900
 let's put this and then already when 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:25.260
 form you have to put say 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:28.620
 that la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.870
 to this thing that is called pumpkin like that 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.480
 pumpkin 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:36.180
 and here is our iron golem this 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:39.270
 lend to give the 0.12 and then he 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:42.870
 will defend everything just mentioned 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:45.000
 which is very let's say very and it 's very expensive 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.530
 ie he makes while and is mentioned 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.540
 too expensive or four blocks of 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:54.120
 Iron is not very expensive but it has a lot 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:57.300
 life and well we already know how to do it and 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.760
 let's go with the snow golem first is 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.640
 one of snow is something like that 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:07.070
 that pretty much like two blocks one 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:07.070
 over the other and then the other is like that 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.919
 and then here would be our golem of 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:14.860
 snow that this may not be there but there 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:16.389
 have hope all of them and then 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.490
 I had fun making this video with 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:20.500
 you remember to subscribe and give you the 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.669
 air this video if you liked comments 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.990
 me here below what you want me to 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:25.840
 speak in the following video that would be the 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:28.900
 of tomorrow things that you do not know about the 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:31.980
 0.12 let's say hears giorgi as if grafite 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.720
 to the exhibition table 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.670
 How do I know how the portal is made? 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.080
 see how we make a position of 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.600
 poisoning they leave me in the 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:42.540
 comments and then I'll see what I'll do 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:45.960
 video not and post friend jordi gamer 072 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:48.810
 it goes bye bye friends bye bye bye hello hello 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:53.390

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.390
 0.12 but yes goodbye
