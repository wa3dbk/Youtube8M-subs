those there that are not experts on this
you<00:01:00.390> mentioned<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.840> GTS<00:01:01.260> that's<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.800> grand

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
you mentioned the GTS that's the grand

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.410 
you mentioned the GTS that's the grand
which<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.290> largest<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.460> largest<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:06.150> the

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
which is the largest the largest of the

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.240 
which is the largest the largest of the
among<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.110> lychee<00:01:07.380> an<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.740> largest<00:01:08.100> one

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
among the lychee an is the largest one

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.730 
among the lychee an is the largest one
absolutely<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.180> there's<00:01:09.450> more<00:01:10.320> or<00:01:10.439> less<00:01:10.560> how

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
absolutely and there's more or less how

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.890 
absolutely and there's more or less how
many<00:01:10.920> mores<00:01:11.220> or<00:01:11.460> localities<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.450> we<00:01:12.540> have<00:01:12.720> on

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
many mores or localities that we have on

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:20.929 
many mores or localities that we have on
there<00:01:13.460> okay<00:01:18.560> okay<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.979> there's<00:01:20.159> like<00:01:20.400> four<00:01:20.759> or

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
there okay okay and there's like four or

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.969 
there okay okay and there's like four or
five<00:01:21.150> different<00:01:21.509> morphs<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.530> mainland

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
five different morphs of the mainland

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.850 
five different morphs of the mainland
and<00:01:23.700> then<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:23.970> have<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.270> island<00:01:24.720> form<00:01:25.049> which

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
and then you have the island form which

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.399 
and then you have the island form which
in<00:01:26.189> there's<00:01:26.430> about<00:01:26.759> six<00:01:27.630> or<00:01:27.810> seven<00:01:28.229> different

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
in there's about six or seven different

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.069 
in there's about six or seven different
islands<00:01:29.130> so<00:01:29.820> we<00:01:29.970> have<00:01:30.180> its<00:01:30.689> getting<00:01:30.960> like<00:01:31.049> a

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
islands so we have its getting like a

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.780 
islands so we have its getting like a
ball<00:01:31.439> python<00:01:31.619> type<00:01:32.070> thing<00:01:32.280> here<00:01:32.460> with<00:01:32.610> like<00:01:32.700> a

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
ball python type thing here with like a

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.280 
ball python type thing here with like a
whole<00:01:32.909> bunch<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.270> different<00:01:33.420> right<00:01:33.900> right

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
whole bunch of different right right

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.260 
whole bunch of different right right
it's<00:01:34.619> not<00:01:34.799> just<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.369> genetics<00:01:35.850> like<00:01:36.030> that

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
it's not just the genetics like that

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.539 
it's not just the genetics like that
it's<00:01:36.479> basically<00:01:36.900> from<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.409> island<00:01:37.829> isolation

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
it's basically from the island isolation

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.450 
it's basically from the island isolation
breeding<00:01:39.030> got<00:01:39.329> is<00:01:39.720> what<00:01:40.049> we<00:01:40.740> can<00:01:41.220> see<00:01:41.430> a

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
breeding got is what we can see a

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.490 
breeding got is what we can see a
difference<00:01:41.970> in<00:01:42.060> coloration<00:01:42.509> is<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:43.049> right

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
difference in coloration is that right

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.100 
difference in coloration is that right
island<00:01:44.040> specific<00:01:44.610> trait<00:01:45.030> yeah<00:01:45.509> that's<00:01:45.810> an<00:01:45.990> eye

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
island specific trait yeah that's an eye

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.100 
island specific trait yeah that's an eye
I'll<00:01:46.950> eat<00:01:47.340> it's<00:01:47.640> from<00:01:47.820> more<00:01:48.060> more<00:01:48.479> Oh<00:01:48.509> Allan

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
I'll eat it's from more more Oh Allan

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.880 
I'll eat it's from more more Oh Allan
okay<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.770> this<00:01:50.009> is<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.340> new

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.950 

that's<00:01:54.890> self-explanatory<00:01:55.700> there<00:01:56.210> yep<00:01:56.719> at

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
that's self-explanatory there yep at

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.330 
that's self-explanatory there yep at
first<00:01:57.259> when<00:01:57.409> they<00:01:57.439> came<00:01:57.710> in<00:01:57.950> they<00:01:58.130> used

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
first when they came in they used

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.130 
first when they came in they used
letters<00:02:00.969> they<00:02:01.969> didn't<00:02:02.240> have<00:02:02.390> names<00:02:02.810> on<00:02:03.049> the

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
letters they didn't have names on the

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.230 
letters they didn't have names on the
IDs

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
IDs
