our first two modules what we're doing

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.599 
our first two modules what we're doing
is<00:00:21.660> we're<00:00:22.020> measuring<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.590> effects<00:00:22.980> of<00:00:23.100> the

and<00:01:21.890> what<00:01:22.189> the<00:01:22.340> students<00:01:22.670> are<00:01:22.789> looking<00:01:22.880> to<00:01:23.240> do

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
and what the students are looking to do

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.630 
and what the students are looking to do
is<00:01:23.420> from<00:01:23.960> the<00:01:24.079> response<00:01:24.500> of<00:01:24.679> blood<00:01:24.890> glucose<00:01:25.340> as

a curve over an hour and a half as a
period<00:01:28.159> of<00:01:28.219> time<00:01:28.429> we've<00:01:29.210> had<00:01:29.329> to<00:01:29.420> take<00:01:29.539> a<00:01:29.600> blood

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
period of time we've had to take a blood

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.350 
period of time we've had to take a blood
sample<00:01:30.170> from<00:01:30.530> our<00:01:30.740> participant<00:01:31.250> and<00:01:31.789> which

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
sample from our participant and which

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.870 
sample from our participant and which
was<00:01:32.539> a<00:01:32.570> resting<00:01:33.049> sample<00:01:33.950> which<00:01:34.579> was<00:01:34.610> then

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
was a resting sample which was then

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.149 
was a resting sample which was then
analyzed<00:01:35.240> on<00:01:35.390> machines<00:01:35.780> and<00:01:36.200> she's<00:01:37.009> now

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
analyzed on machines and she's now

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.219 
analyzed on machines and she's now
consumed<00:01:37.700> 100<00:01:38.030> grams<00:01:38.179> of<00:01:38.299> dark<00:01:38.420> chocolate<00:01:38.539> and

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
consumed 100 grams of dark chocolate and

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:40.809 
consumed 100 grams of dark chocolate and
we're<00:01:39.380> now<00:01:39.500> testing<00:01:39.560> the<00:01:40.009> blood<00:01:40.219> again<00:01:40.429> to<00:01:40.610> see

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:40.819 
we're now testing the blood again to see

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:42.309 
we're now testing the blood again to see
what<00:01:41.000> happens<00:01:41.299> her<00:01:41.420> blood<00:01:41.630> glucose<00:01:41.929> over<00:01:42.079> the

00:01:42.309 --> 00:01:42.319 
what happens her blood glucose over the

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:52.630 
what happens her blood glucose over the
next<00:01:42.590> 60<00:01:43.039> to<00:01:43.130> 100<00:01:43.459> minutes<00:01:50.649> so<00:01:51.649> what<00:01:51.890> values

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
next 60 to 100 minutes so what values

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.499 
next 60 to 100 minutes so what values
did<00:01:52.880> you<00:01:53.030> get<00:01:54.340> so<00:01:55.340> you<00:01:55.429> can<00:01:55.579> stop<00:01:55.819> what's<00:01:56.390> in

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
did you get so you can stop what's in

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.059 
did you get so you can stop what's in
your<00:01:56.599> graph<00:01:56.810> now<00:01:57.079> and<00:01:57.319> thinking<00:01:57.799> about<00:01:57.950> what

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:58.069 
your graph now and thinking about what

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:59.889 
your graph now and thinking about what
happens<00:01:58.429> so<00:01:58.670> what<00:01:59.149> were<00:01:59.209> you<00:01:59.329> expecting<00:01:59.630> to

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
happens so what were you expecting to

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:05.609 
happens so what were you expecting to
happen<00:01:59.959> now<00:02:00.380> after<00:02:00.739> it's<00:02:00.860> gone<00:02:00.950> up<00:02:01.130> slightly

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.789 

from<00:02:06.700> we're<00:02:07.700> hoping<00:02:08.000> to<00:02:08.060> find<00:02:08.360> that<00:02:08.799> the

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:09.799 
from we're hoping to find that the

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:12.550 
from we're hoping to find that the
effect<00:02:09.920> of<00:02:10.459> glycemic<00:02:11.390> index<00:02:11.750> on<00:02:12.019> literally

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
effect of glycemic index on literally

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.789 
effect of glycemic index on literally
face<00:02:12.739> levels<00:02:13.160> and<00:02:13.640> we've<00:02:13.760> received<00:02:14.090> a<00:02:14.420> low

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
face levels and we've received a low

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:17.350 
face levels and we've received a low
glycemic<00:02:15.799> index<00:02:16.099> food<00:02:16.370> so<00:02:16.700> we're<00:02:17.060> trying<00:02:17.239> to

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
glycemic index food so we're trying to

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.520 
glycemic index food so we're trying to
test<00:02:17.540> that<00:02:17.660> against<00:02:17.930> people<00:02:18.290> who<00:02:18.349> haven't

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
test that against people who haven't

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.330 
test that against people who haven't
seen<00:02:18.769> too<00:02:18.950> high<00:02:19.130> the<00:02:19.879> indisputable<00:02:21.069> this<00:02:22.069> sort

of<00:02:22.370> test<00:02:22.610> is<00:02:22.849> what's<00:02:23.030> done<00:02:23.239> to<00:02:24.019> actually

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
of test is what's done to actually

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.110 
of test is what's done to actually
measure<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.769> glycemic<00:02:25.129> index<00:02:25.370> of<00:02:25.730> foods<00:02:25.880> in

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
measure the glycemic index of foods in

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.509 
measure the glycemic index of foods in
industry<00:02:26.600> as<00:02:26.720> well<00:02:26.930> so<00:02:27.859> our<00:02:28.040> students<00:02:28.430> are

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
industry as well so our students are

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.340 
industry as well so our students are
getting<00:02:28.639> practical<00:02:29.480> application<00:02:30.079> because

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
getting practical application because

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.170 
getting practical application because
they've<00:02:30.470> just<00:02:30.620> had<00:02:30.769> a<00:02:30.799> lecture<00:02:31.220> on<00:02:31.280> glucose

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
they've just had a lecture on glucose

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.470 
they've just had a lecture on glucose
homeostasis<00:02:33.280> in<00:02:34.280> three<00:02:34.730> weeks<00:02:34.910> time<00:02:35.180> they'll

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
homeostasis in three weeks time they'll

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.729 
homeostasis in three weeks time they'll
actually<00:02:35.630> be<00:02:35.959> assessed<00:02:36.350> and<00:02:36.590> their

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
actually be assessed and their

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.979 
actually be assessed and their
competency<00:02:37.489> of<00:02:37.519> blood<00:02:37.760> sampling<00:02:38.269> and<00:02:38.600> how

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
competency of blood sampling and how

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:40.240 
competency of blood sampling and how
they<00:02:39.109> analyze<00:02:39.290> it<00:02:39.739> and<00:02:39.829> they'll<00:02:39.980> be<00:02:40.069> asked

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
they analyze it and they'll be asked

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.790 
they analyze it and they'll be asked
questions<00:02:40.310> related<00:02:41.239> to<00:02:41.269> the<00:02:41.450> theory
