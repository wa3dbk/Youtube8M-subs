00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:11.849
 today we make tagliatelle with ragù 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.610
 white is a sauce that is very fast that not 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:18.119
 it must cook a lot and therefore lends itself 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.699
 good or easier and immediate respect 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.100
 a traditional robot can be done 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.430
 tagliatelle or other types of pasta there 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.800
 want carrot onion celery oil 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.340
 extra virgin olive oil is made with 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:37.110
 sausage the sweet sausage then 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:40.079
 the one by the meter we say the minced meat 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.719
 of pork from the nut of the dry white wine 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.539
 then in the end I always use martini like that 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.289
 I'm sure it 's dry and some parmesan 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:52.410
 to serve the doses you find them here state 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.410
 be careful to use little nut so for one 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.300
 dose of four takes half a nut 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.760
 otherwise it could be too salty 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:06.720
 announce with clean the carrot for 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:08.510
 make the sauté and the celery or cut 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.240
 in small pieces 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:17.540
 as you are more comfortable in short I use 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.540
 this system but you can of course 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.979
 do as you feel 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:30.590
 the carrot must be made the same way 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.590
 small bits here 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.280
 and away with the carrot 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:43.600
 when you made all the carrot 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:46.899
 you must also hold an onion is 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:50.049
 the typical chopped celery carrots 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:52.690
 onions I will sell it even frozen is not 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.789
 very tasty but they sell it already 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.789
 frozen ready so if you are in a hurry 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:02.830
 you can also use the bags of 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:06.340
 sauté with ice cream which I too admit 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:10.179
 to keep in the freezer because at 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.250
 sometimes it can also serve onion 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.510
 made into small pieces 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.500
 when you have invited all the vegetables 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:22.450
 allows the usual frying pan a little 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:30.060
 olive oil and sauté the 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:32.110
 sauté vegetables but for good 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.070
 while the vegetables suffered 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:40.019
 in learning the luganega sausage 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:48.000
 also called and you have to remove the skin 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:52.989
 but peeled and cut into small pieces 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.880
 nibbled we say done this 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:59.470
 operation 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:02.709
 when the vegetables have suffered you put 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.950
 the half nut here is actually a die 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.780
 because it is a thing as before for 4 people 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.030
 it takes half a nut be careful because 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.720
 then the sausage is easy that tent knows 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:17.620
 be too salty then the nut or the 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:20.500
 promised salt with measure then throw the 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.859
 meat to fry her too in focus 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.859
 I live 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.730
 here it is 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.560
 let the meat color well 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:48.250
 in the meantime I put the water of the 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:56.550
 pasta to boil then add the wine or 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:56.550
 dry martini let it evaporate well 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:17.150
 here it is and then you cover it you go 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.940
 for about twenty minutes in focus 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:24.870
 moderate to have darkened a little a lot perhaps 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:27.840
 the fire was too bright anyway 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.770
 let it simmer slowly in the meantime 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.930
 throw away the pasta 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.669
 then let it go for 20 minutes then 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.190
 throw the noodles then there are few 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:38.010
 minutes other types of pasta put us of 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:42.300
 more when the pasta is ready 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:44.610
 drain and throw away and jump with the 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.580
 usual method I never give up 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.970
 this method because in my way of 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.680
 see the taste of pasta 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:55.350
 completely different flavor 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.510
 otherwise 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.820
 here is served with a little bit of 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:03.240
 I put only the parsley Parmesan 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:06.380
 for beauty and for making the movie 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.380
 hello everyone the next
