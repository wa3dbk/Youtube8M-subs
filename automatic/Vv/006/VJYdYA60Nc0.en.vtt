00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 you are happy with your washing machine it 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.049
 too much noise and vibrates it 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.820
 depends on the features of the model 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.510
 washing machine and and internal 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.309
 constructions 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.960
 if you look inside your 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.210
 washing machine then you will see washing 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.949
 drum motor and items that 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.340
 connect the drums motor between themselves 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:23.789
 our research began under the motto 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:26.820
 less is better after numerous 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.380
 research answer became obvious why 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.359
 we do not bring the drum in motion 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.859
 directly with the motor why 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.090
 we use the traditional system 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.670
 drum rotation 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.210
 this was the beginning of the system of direct 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.760
 the drive 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.710
 but to get to the finish line us 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.510
 I had to go a long and hard way 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.579
 this motor causes noise 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.489
 issued by the washing machine and this 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.200
 the belt vibrates this block 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.930
 made of concrete it's called balance 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.360
 drum it takes up a lot of space and 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.430
 makes the car harder our goal was 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.879
 increase washing load 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.870
 cars 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.090
 as well as reduce noise and vibration if 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.920
 connect this rotating axis with the motor 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.229
 then the need to use a belt and 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.130
 pulley disappears so you can reduce 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:14.820
 vibration but it is the motor that causes 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.020
 noise when operating the washing machine when 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.330
 using such a universal 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.950
 motor cannot reduce noise or 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.259
 increase washing load 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.920
 we really needed a car 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:29.400
 new motor more compact and less 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.350
 noisy to create a compact and 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.680
 silent motor, we decided to remove the brush 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.150
 from the traditional motor but this process 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.710
 associated with the use of permanent 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.340
 the magnet in the motor of the washing machine 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.110
 to solve such a problem was not easy 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.799
 we conducted a study for two 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.689
 years at last we have developed a system with 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.990
 direct drive motor our invention 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.610
 has become a true innovation traditional 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.720
 drum rotation system which 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.320
 used for a hundred years 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.490
 gave way to a completely new concept 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.229
 we proudly present to you 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.680
 direct washing machine 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.680
 the drive 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.090
 what benefits does a direct system 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:08.860
 the drive 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.019
 firstly direct drive system 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.519
 provides a greater load what 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.170
 standard sized washing machines 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.239
 because such a system allows 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.060
 increase the size of the drum compared to 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.650
 traditional washing machines in 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.660
 second from the washing machine with direct 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.660
 driven less noise than from traditional 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.260
 thirdly, you will be able to enjoy their own 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.970
 washing machine at any time and in 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.860
 anywhere like washing machine 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.310
 direct drive system vibrates less 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.290
 than other direct drive motor 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.000
 has greater reliability thanks to 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.400
 the use of special technologies and 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.079
 of course there are fewer parts in it jess 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.829
 proudly presents a washing machine 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:46.829
 direct system
