00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 so welcome to second favorite 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:08.220
 Exercise of Markus Karalus the 2nd 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:12.150
 this is a static exercise markus and 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.690
 I'll do it now and do it 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.690
 maybe after 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:28.369
 so here you see 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:31.340
 I'm already pressing with good force markus 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.170
 Without a clue, he tried statically too 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.230
 hold like a cologne yourself 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:39.290
 tried not to pull his arms up 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.629
 yes, so it has as try as 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.809
 Static to keep the power throughout 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:47.120
 So we have the endurance 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:52.190
 Exercise also in the program of 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:57.379
 markus and markus also say briefly 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:59.449
 what about the exercise think about the exercise 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.220
 here presented in freefight comes stop 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.960
 on that one also a force 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.939
 has endurance because you have to sometimes 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.500
 you have to find my position 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:09.020
 that's why you can mix it up 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.060
 in mm or even a little bell there 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.439
 seldom do we attract an enemy 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.360
 defend at most times the arm like that 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:16.310
 but if we have to defend then 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.229
 just happen with force because otherwise 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.299
 the other uses that out, that's why it is 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.920
 always doing well my static 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:24.110
 recommendation to the soldo is short 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.820
 at least two times 30 seconds too 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.290
 hold 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.790
 You can do this exercise too, you have to 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.130
 Do not run with a partner from her 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.830
 can it somewhere a wall making 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.290
 or somehow at the windowsill ingo 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.210
 was heavy is just your hands 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.550
 statically try to pull something up 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:44.630
 so that you stop the muscle and the ar 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.159
 Musculature has been exhausting so far 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.460
 Of course there are also variations of 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.600
 exercise with stretched arms with 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.900
 bent in different positions 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.850
 like covers on the stomach are lying on 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.680
 the back lying so you can by 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.690
 a whole range of ideas came true 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.549
 the simplest variant is the markus us 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.490
 has presented but of course there is 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.770
 even heavier 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.229
 variants and I think you can 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:13.140
 first with the simple beginning markus 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.140
 recommended after deduction next video
