immediately to the light of the shift
key<00:02:53.340> so<00:02:54.340> now<00:02:54.370> that<00:02:54.730> was<00:02:54.939> my<00:02:55.090> fault

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
I'll connect to that and then start

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.960 
I'll connect to that and then start
recalling<00:04:31.160> again<00:04:31.720> when<00:04:32.720> I've<00:04:33.050> got<00:04:33.760> past<00:04:34.760> this
