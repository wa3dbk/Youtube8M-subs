close to two months and I thought it was
dead<00:00:24.550> I<00:00:24.580> thought<00:00:25.119> it<00:00:25.300> wasn't<00:00:25.480> gonna<00:00:25.660> do

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
dead I thought it wasn't gonna do

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.740 
dead I thought it wasn't gonna do
anything<00:00:26.320> but<00:00:26.529> um<00:00:26.800> it<00:00:27.250> did<00:00:27.789> actually<00:00:28.269> start<00:00:28.630> to

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:28.750 
anything but um it did actually start to

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.450 
anything but um it did actually start to
get<00:00:28.960> these<00:00:29.109> little<00:00:29.350> white<00:00:29.619> dots<00:00:29.890> on<00:00:30.130> the<00:00:30.250> side

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460

of<00:00:30.699> it<00:00:30.849> um<00:00:31.060> and<00:00:31.829> it<00:00:32.829> eventually<00:00:33.420> grew<00:00:34.420> roots<00:00:34.870> as

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
camera too well but there's like a

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.529 
camera too well but there's like a
little<00:01:39.009> little<00:01:39.670> white<00:01:39.939> dots<00:01:40.210> that<00:01:40.479> are

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:40.539 
little little white dots that are

little little white dots that are
forming<00:01:41.170> right<00:01:41.289> there<00:01:41.530> and<00:01:41.740> those<00:01:41.890> are<00:01:41.950> the

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
forming right there and those are the

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:43.050 
forming right there and those are the
roots<00:01:42.429> um

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
roots um

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.599 
roots um
they<00:01:43.509> start<00:01:43.840> off<00:01:43.960> as<00:01:44.229> like<00:01:45.219> little<00:01:45.490> white

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:45.609

they start off as like little white
bumps<00:01:45.909> and<00:01:46.299> then<00:01:46.390> they<00:01:46.569> they<00:01:47.200> get<00:01:47.409> bigger<00:01:47.619> and

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
bumps and then they they get bigger and

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.889 
bumps and then they they get bigger and
longer<00:01:48.039> and<00:01:48.369> like<00:01:48.939> I<00:01:49.060> said<00:01:49.210> turning<00:01:49.420> the<00:01:49.689> roots

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
longer and like I said turning the roots

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:52.849 
longer and like I said turning the roots
but<00:01:50.409> these<00:01:50.619> I<00:01:50.649> knew<00:01:51.039> are<00:01:51.310> still<00:01:51.579> alive<00:01:51.850> because

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:52.859 
but these I knew are still alive because

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:56.849 
but these I knew are still alive because
the<00:01:53.859> tips<00:01:54.130> of<00:01:54.310> them<00:01:55.079> know<00:01:56.079> how<00:01:56.499> well<00:01:56.679> you<00:01:56.829> can

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:56.859 
the tips of them know how well you can

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:58.649 
the tips of them know how well you can
see<00:01:57.189> that<00:01:57.369> but<00:01:57.549> they're<00:01:57.729> actually<00:01:57.909> green<00:01:58.329> and

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
see that but they're actually green and

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.660 
see that but they're actually green and
this<00:01:59.229> just<00:01:59.469> recently<00:01:59.679> started<00:02:00.249> they're

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
this just recently started they're

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.359 
this just recently started they're
they're<00:02:01.030> starting<00:02:01.450> to<00:02:01.479> sprout<00:02:01.810> some<00:02:02.079> leaves

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
they're starting to sprout some leaves

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.160 
they're starting to sprout some leaves
are<00:02:03.369> get<00:02:03.819> little<00:02:04.060> buds<00:02:04.299> on<00:02:04.539> them<00:02:04.659> so<00:02:05.020> I<00:02:05.049> know

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
are get little buds on them so I know

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.899 
are get little buds on them so I know
that<00:02:05.439> they're<00:02:05.590> alive<00:02:05.710> they're<00:02:06.130> just<00:02:06.369> you<00:02:06.850> know

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:08.909 

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:11.970 

waiting<00:02:09.909> to<00:02:10.149> get<00:02:10.269> their<00:02:10.420> roots<00:02:10.629> I<00:02:10.780> guess<00:02:10.980> but

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
waiting to get their roots I guess but

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.500 
waiting to get their roots I guess but
anyway<00:02:12.390> these<00:02:13.390> are<00:02:13.470> most

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
anyway these are most

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.390 
anyway these are most
were<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:16.690> tips<00:02:16.960> of<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.410> branches<00:02:17.620> but<00:02:18.340> I

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
were the tips of the branches but I

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.260 
were the tips of the branches but I
wanted<00:02:18.700> to<00:02:18.790> show<00:02:19.030> you<00:02:20.430> this<00:02:21.430> one<00:02:21.640> right<00:02:21.820> here

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
wanted to show you this one right here

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.020 
wanted to show you this one right here
the<00:02:22.870> tip<00:02:23.140> was<00:02:23.320> already<00:02:23.620> cut<00:02:23.860> off<00:02:24.010> of<00:02:24.280> it<00:02:24.460> but

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
the tip was already cut off of it but

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.420 
the tip was already cut off of it but
yet<00:02:25.300> it's<00:02:25.930> still<00:02:26.230> growing<00:02:26.890> a<00:02:27.040> little<00:02:27.130> bud

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
yet it's still growing a little bud

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.470 
yet it's still growing a little bud
there<00:02:27.700> and<00:02:29.340> see<00:02:30.340> that<00:02:30.490> little<00:02:30.610> white<00:02:30.880> dot<00:02:30.910> now

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
there and see that little white dot now

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.380 
there and see that little white dot now
you<00:02:31.540> can<00:02:31.750> see<00:02:31.960> it<00:02:32.370> that's<00:02:33.370> where<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:34.150> root

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
you can see it that's where the root

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.510 
you can see it that's where the root
itself<00:02:34.870> is<00:02:35.200> forming<00:02:35.680> and<00:02:36.070> it's<00:02:36.220> going<00:02:36.430> to

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
itself is forming and it's going to

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.960 
itself is forming and it's going to
sprout<00:02:36.790> out<00:02:36.850> so<00:02:37.330> even<00:02:38.310> you<00:02:39.310> know<00:02:39.460> a<00:02:39.490> cut<00:02:39.850> off

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
sprout out so even you know a cut off

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.930 
sprout out so even you know a cut off
branch<00:02:40.360> will<00:02:40.870> work<00:02:41.080> so<00:02:41.560> just<00:02:42.460> wanted<00:02:42.700> to<00:02:42.760> show

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
branch will work so just wanted to show

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.360 
branch will work so just wanted to show
you<00:02:42.970> guys<00:02:43.120> that<00:02:43.540> if<00:02:44.110> you<00:02:44.290> got<00:02:44.440> a<00:02:44.470> friend<00:02:44.890> that

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
has some fig trees you can get some

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.560 
has some fig trees you can get some
branches<00:02:51.220> from<00:02:51.460> them<00:02:51.610> and<00:02:51.820> throw<00:02:52.420> them<00:02:52.450> in

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
branches from them and throw them in

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.630 
branches from them and throw them in
some<00:02:52.780> water<00:02:52.960> and<00:02:53.350> you<00:02:54.010> know<00:02:54.130> just<00:02:54.310> wait<00:02:54.460> for

some water and you know just wait for
the<00:02:54.730> roots<00:02:54.940> to<00:02:55.060> just<00:02:55.720> start<00:02:57.270> anyway<00:02:58.270> and<00:02:58.450> don't

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.120 
stuff so you'll know what it is later
and<00:04:15.010> then<00:04:15.959> after<00:04:16.959> you've<00:04:17.079> planted<00:04:17.350> it<00:04:17.680> you've

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
and then after you've planted it you've

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.060 
and then after you've planted it you've
labeled<00:04:18.430> it<00:04:19.200> order<00:04:20.200> it<00:04:20.260> in<00:04:20.440> and<00:04:20.769> I'm<00:04:20.859> gonna

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
labeled it order it in and I'm gonna

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.700 
labeled it order it in and I'm gonna
give<00:04:21.340> it<00:04:21.489> more<00:04:21.700> water<00:04:22.030> than<00:04:22.330> this<00:04:22.510> but<00:04:23.320> I<00:04:23.530> mean

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
give it more water than this but I mean

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.710 
give it more water than this but I mean
just<00:04:24.130> for<00:04:24.280> video<00:04:24.550> purposes<00:04:24.820> I<00:04:25.300> think<00:04:25.510> y'all

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
just for video purposes I think y'all

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.950 
just for video purposes I think y'all
get<00:04:25.990> the<00:04:26.110> point<00:04:26.350> and<00:04:27.060> this<00:04:28.060> requires<00:04:28.540> a<00:04:28.660> lot

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
get the point and this requires a lot

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.260 
get the point and this requires a lot
more<00:04:29.200> water<00:04:29.440> what<00:04:29.740> I<00:04:29.770> actually<00:04:30.070> like<00:04:30.370> to<00:04:30.640> do<00:04:30.940> is
