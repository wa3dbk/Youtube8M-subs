in you got King King ace followed the
ACE<00:00:56.239> there's<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.480> ACE<00:00:57.600> there's<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.590> second

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
ACE there's the ACE there's a second

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.630 
ACE there's the ACE there's a second
there's<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.820> ACE<00:01:00.000> again<00:01:00.980> so<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.039> say<00:01:02.340> easy

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
there's the ACE again so you say easy

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.319 
there's the ACE again so you say easy
enough

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
enough

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.539

the<00:01:03.480> ACE<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.780> right<00:01:03.989> here<00:01:04.320> but<00:01:04.979> lo<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.250> behold

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
the ACE is right here but lo and behold

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.800 
the ACE is right here but lo and behold
the<00:01:06.540> ACE<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.780> actually<00:01:07.619> right<00:01:08.340> here<00:01:08.820> all<00:01:09.090> right

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
the ACE is actually right here all right

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.330 
the ACE is actually right here all right
I'll<00:01:09.960> make<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.229> easier<00:01:10.590> we'll<00:01:10.920> put<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.189> ACE

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
I'll make it easier we'll put the ACE

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.310 
I'll make it easier we'll put the ACE
over<00:01:11.640> here<00:01:11.909> King<00:01:12.450> King<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:13.950> where<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.850> ACE

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
over here King King so where is the ACE

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.289 
over here King King so where is the ACE
now<00:01:16.320> if<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.500> said<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.830> ACE<00:01:16.979> was<00:01:17.250> here<00:01:17.640> well

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
now if you said the ACE was here well

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.749 
now if you said the ACE was here well
then<00:01:18.570> you're<00:01:18.840> wrong<00:01:19.110> again<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.920> imbecile

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
have to learn two things how to grip the

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.910 
have to learn two things how to grip the
cards<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.640> how<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.909> do<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.119> false<00:01:27.479> toss<00:01:27.810> so<00:01:28.770> when

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
cards and how to do a false toss so when

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.679 
cards and how to do a false toss so when
you<00:01:29.009> grip<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.280> cards<00:01:29.759> grab<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.180> first<00:01:30.450> card

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
you grip the cards grab the first card

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.240 
you grip the cards grab the first card
between<00:01:31.049> your<00:01:31.170> middle<00:01:31.350> finger<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.799> thumb<00:01:31.860> and

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
between your middle finger and thumb and

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.100 
between your middle finger and thumb and
the<00:01:32.490> second<00:01:32.880> card<00:01:33.090> between<00:01:33.329> your<00:01:33.630> ring<00:01:33.780> finger

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
the second card between your ring finger

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.990 
the second card between your ring finger
and<00:01:34.140> thumb<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:35.250> instead<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.549> throwing<00:01:35.820> the

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
and thumb so instead of throwing the

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.810 
and thumb so instead of throwing the
bottom<00:01:36.299> card<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:37.380> throw<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.770> top<00:01:37.979> card<00:01:38.310> like

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
bottom card you throw the top card like

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.380 
bottom card you throw the top card like
this<00:01:39.799> then<00:01:40.799> do<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.009> few<00:01:41.280> more<00:01:41.430> tosses<00:01:42.000> just<00:01:42.299> to

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
this then do a few more tosses just to

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.990 
this then do a few more tosses just to
make<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.570> look<00:01:42.689> challenging

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
make it look challenging

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.940 
make it look challenging
so<00:01:44.600> whenever<00:01:44.780> they<00:01:45.080> think<00:01:45.380> that<00:01:45.470> the<00:01:45.620> ace<00:01:45.740> is

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
so whenever they think that the ace is

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.460 
so whenever they think that the ace is
over<00:01:46.190> here<00:01:46.490> you<00:01:46.720> know<00:01:47.720> that<00:01:47.870> it's<00:01:48.050> actually

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
over here you know that it's actually

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.130 
over here you know that it's actually
right<00:01:48.830> here<00:01:49.270> grip<00:01:50.270> the<00:01:50.420> first<00:01:50.630> card<00:01:50.900> with

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
right here grip the first card with

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.930 
right here grip the first card with
thumb<00:01:51.320> and<00:01:51.470> middle<00:01:51.590> finger<00:01:51.740> the<00:01:52.400> bottom<00:01:52.700> card
