00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:25.850
 today discount coupon dropped 10 to 10% 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:28.400
 off the store and mortgage 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.440
 beauty as you have seen in the title 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.910
 theme of this video will be stretch marks 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.070
 many people have asked me about the 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.450
 kids how to avoid them and what to do 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.190
 for those people who already have it 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.020
 They want to get rid of them, let's go then. 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.910
 first of all I wanted to say yes 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.770
 I have stretch marks a lot of people ask me 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.840
 If I have scratch, my works are 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.730
 right here in this area I'll put some 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.079
 photos for you can see she has already been 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.329
 much redder 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.010
 I 'm lightening now, but how are you? 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.230
 normal is almost impossible for you 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.239
 realize them and honestly I never 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.160
 I called her and I always found something. 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.170
 cool the beginning so that our 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.910
 cool, I'm growing and in mine 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.890
 opinion is something that is part of the 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.079
 our sport is like a brand 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.759
 of war and bari builder now 

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:09.859
 you have many stars in several 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:11.719
 places might be something that will 

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:13.520
 bother a little you will not 

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:14.929
 You felt so comfortable with them. 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.520
 have people do not even like 

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:18.560
 take off the shirt sometimes when there is too much 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.479
 hysteria now is not just bari builder 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.249
 our people training that has had 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.499
 the star is due to when you have a 

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:26.689
 very fast muscle growth 

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:28.880
 of the bones and the skin does not 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:31.849
 accompany this growth then 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.499
 stretched and ends up ripping and then ripped 

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:35.869
 and it would be more or less the stretch marks 

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:37.459
 start they are rather reddish them 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.020
 they are more purple they are very visible 

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:41.179
 this way but after a while 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.679
 they end up clearing and stood 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:44.810
 practically the same all your skin 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:47.359
 then it imperceptible itself but ends up 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.740
 altering is skin texture the stars 

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:51.560
 wider that appears more 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.169
 appropriately they may be symptoms 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.700
 of endocrine disorders then there 

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:58.459
 you would have to see a doctor yourself 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.130
 and see this with him only remembering here that 

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:02.869
 There is no way you can cure the star. 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.880
 How do you make her disappear? 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.979
 there are methods for you to let them 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.840
 less apparent to reduce that factor 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.540
 aesthetic and all this will depend on the 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.500
 phase of the thickness of it in which 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.510
 body part 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.190
 will're so how does not like me heal 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.920
 the stretch marks which would be a cool way 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.990
 to prevent it there to prevent the 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.170
 stars appeared first of all is 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:26.660
 bbb water drink plenty of water always 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.180
 very well treated I recommend soon 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.580
 everybody and the 4 5 liters of 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.530
 water a day a recommendation is more 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.750
 specific thing I do in the diet video 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.060
 part 1 if you want to give a confere there 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.070
 it's more at the end of the good video because baby 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.630
 so much water without premeditated district 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.540
 because the skin will tear when it is 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.700
 dry and do not have good elasticity assisted 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.739
 they are caused by lack of collagen 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.930
 and elastin when there are vitamins 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.660
 also help with this production. 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.850
 collagen, etc. for you to prevent 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.100
 they have stretch marks vitae papers out this 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.570
 part and with megadoses of these vitamins 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.970
 You'll certainly be very successful. 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:05.030
 there to avoid these stars 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.760
 girls are the aceea people vitamin 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.620
 has a mineral and zinc then pro parts the 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.450
 first vitamin A is very important 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.489
 for skin growth the type of skin 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.650
 healthy oil it will help repair the 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.870
 damaged skin it will help you to 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.580
 improve your dry and flaky skin is fine 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.040
 for the purpose of stretch marks 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.780
 vitamin C applied top-down ie 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.820
 on the skin because so it will be 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.860
 absorbed by the skin and will leave on the skin 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.630
 well moist is the experiments shows that 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.950
 how application is made directly on 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.170
 the skin it helps to leave the skin 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.060
 saturated and managed to finish it will 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.860
 assist in the process of renewal of 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.019
 epidermal cells in increasing the 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.400
 collagen content and consequently 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:42.709
 the elasticity of the skin 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.000
 good now vitamin c vitamin c is very 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.820
 important because it requires 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.560
 simple and take off what does this mean 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.120
 means that your body produces 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.530
 collagen it must first give 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.320
 vitamin C and one of the major roles 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.540
 it is to help in wound healing 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.310
 and collagen acts as a cement between 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.380
 cells the main role and the 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.480
 collagen is to be a barrier against 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.220
 infections and diseases and promote 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.230
 healing beyond these wounds 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.209
 A cool tip is about Vitamin C is 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.430
 that rust in contact with the sunlight 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:13.070
 so it's not cool to be exposed to light 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.510
 the sun and it's not cool reheat it 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.040
 because the heat ends up destroying the 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.229
 Vitamin C then takes this into 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.880
 consideration when storing your 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:21.979
 vitamins and vitamin is the 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.930
 vitamin a and vitamin is a great 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:25.080
 antioxidant and how do we already know 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.490
 the vitamin she 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.680
 the important thing is the commitment of the 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.659
 normal metabolism and healing of 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.669
 tissues of the body and skin but 

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:34.280
 issue of skin tissue does it really 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.840
 is more important because of the 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.789
 her antioxidant that way she goes 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.349
 preserve the health of this skin and 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:43.050
 of their membranes is also very 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:45.210
 used in the recovery process and 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.280
 healing the surgical hypothesis you 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.900
 you can take it orally or also top 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.909
 cally about his scar on his 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.830
 would be the place most conducive to the actress 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:55.110
 would have been starting more tribal 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.960
 now talk about zinc the zinc is 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.960
 potentially the most 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.909
 important factor in the issue there of 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.979
 stretch marks and avoid 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:07.409
 most important feature of zinc 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:08.849
 is the production of collagen as collagen 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:10.349
 you can already be perceived had 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:13.229
 several times here in this video because 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:15.030
 because if the person has collagen the 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:17.310
 enough in her body is almost 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.960
 impossible that she will have streaks him 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.909
 keeps the skin tissues together and 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.569
 is the most important structural protein 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:26.639
 abundant it accounts for about 80% of 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:28.979
 all our connective tissue there with a 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:32.099
 only shot that collagen it is not 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:33.870
 available in foods that is not to give 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:35.490
 people knew about collagen with our 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.289
 diet but give it to us to get it 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.779
 these vitamins and minerals by our 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:41.669
 diet and thereby increase production 

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:43.409
 of collagen by our body or if 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:45.300
 you can also experiment directly with 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:47.310
 the collagen I ended up not quoting 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.089
 foods that are sources of these 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.979
 vitamins 

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:52.440
 simply because I believe that the 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:54.270
 doses you would need for prevention 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.650
 of stretch marks of course you have to 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.080
 eat your food rich in 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.490
 micronutrients but this would be 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.289
 the cooler you supplement with the 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:04.110
 vitamins and if you really want 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:05.729
 prevent stretch marks supplement top 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.580
 or applied in the form of smoke 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:10.860
 on the skin so that's it I think 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:13.469
 so stars are part of the sport 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.270
 Do not worry too much, it's not too much. 

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:17.210
 attached because if you want 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.110
 Crescêncio you really want 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.669
 legal development will be very 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:23.279
 probably a hysteria that there 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:24.569
 show up but do not get discouraged 

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:26.099
 in a way that your body 

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:27.569
 saying that everything is working 

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:30.360
 that job because you're doing 

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:32.639
 in the result and are our 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.790
 war and after a while she goes 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:35.260
 clear and will stay 

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:37.330
 logically imperceptible but 

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.860
 any way it's cool to know this tip 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.000
 also on the function even these 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.380
 minerals and vitamins 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.270
 So thank you in advance, you want it. 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.250

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.120
 next video
