 message is and architect and artist 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.490
 I live plastic in Córdoba capital 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.799
 two workshops one in the center of the 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.980
 city well close to bookstore 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:18.529
 artistic message on tucumán street and 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.929
 another one in the north zone later also 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:24.230
 I go once a month to good airs of 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:26.359
 these courses and I'm also during the 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.539
 year across the country dictating the courses 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:32.360
 in different cities so in some 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:36.170
 moment we find today I will make a 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.930
 very cute work very colorful maybe it's 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.390
 a little bit difficult to explain because it's 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.400
 say I'm just doing I 'm going 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.510
 doing I'm uncovering the jars of 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:50.179
 paint and I'm emerging colors 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.730
 and things are happening that are going 

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:54.649
 happening as you go pixelated what 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.680
 The only thing I can tell you is that I work 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:00.589
 with acrylic monitors that are the 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.289
 acrylics the three very good thickness 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:06.320
 of very good quality and that have a 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:09.220
 incredible durability in time are 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.619
 special acrylics but professionals 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.560
 they come in different sizes and the truth 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:18.320
 which is a pleasure and a pride to tell 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.690
 with this material I am going to tell you a 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.380
 How did I do the step by step first? 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:28.399
 I was working with white and blue Carlos 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.890
 mazzón cerulean blue throughout 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:33.880
 sky working with a piece of court 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.950
 and well stretched 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.490
 the brush so that they leave 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.560
 fusing together the tones then to that 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.409
 I was adding a green color 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:49.060
 Emerald the right side of the box 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:51.670
 has that sky that seems more celestial 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.000
 what else but in reality it has 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.480
 green too 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.900
 after superimposing brush strokes I went 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:03.960
 working with brush strokes in magenta in 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:07.110
 yellow and orange on the left side 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.570
 of work so on the right side 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.560
 I put celeste on the left side 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:17.850
 jose yellow and orange then with a 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.480
 color that is called blue and I did not start 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.310
 sketch out 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:27.310
 the domes of what it would be 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:31.870
 a cathedral in Venice then and it was and 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:34.810
 working this church with the domes 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.750
 in bluish and the shading was gray 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.360
 of paint and with spatula I was giving 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.090
 some details of lights and shadows 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.400
 as corresponds all the lights 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.040
 the left side the shadows on the side 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.510
 straight 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:53.750
 also from the profile of the limit 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:57.019
 of the horizon work down with 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:00.409
 some horizontal brush strokes and draw 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:03.560
 some very interesting boats like 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:06.680

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.170
 the Venetian gondolas everything 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.840

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.599
