00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.130
 what is on the screen is a machete 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.660
 spider of special manufacture although in 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.080
 many cases find it as a milestone 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.420
 modified the design is called kapanga 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.690
 and it's popular in some parts of asia and 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.990
 it is characterized by that the smooth edge and 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:28.289
 straight is for multipurpose use while 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.990
 that the tip with the highest mass is used 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.600
 to cut in some parts sharpen them 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.720
 at the tip to have something like a 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.239
 chisel and elsewhere tend to sharpen it 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.460
 in this part with a different kind of 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.890
 more serious edge to cut from this 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.289
 this way they have on the screen 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.170
 only it is sharp on one side what 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.510
 I find it quite useful because I know 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.629
 can do this way for cuts 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.100
 strong and at the same time delicate this 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:01.500
 made in 5160 steel of course made 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.199
 frosted and sharpened by hand with a handle 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.900
 metallic also tubular like that of 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:11.490
 other spider that we have seen and has a 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.080
 17-inch and a half blade the handle is 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.670
 of about 6 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.080
 inches and is meant to make a 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.570
 machete puller between 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.670
 most important characteristics that 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.760
 has this knife out of course 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.040
 of the tube handle is in the thickness 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.530
 variable is around about 4 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.050
 millimeters at the base of the sheet and goes 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.570
 decreasing little by little until you reach 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:40.530
 the tip that has about 2 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.990
 millimeters highlighted sharpening with sex 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.960
 that has everything along comes from 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.610
 factory with a pretty good silo does not 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.070
 I hope it has an edge 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.560
 aggressive because it is meant to do 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.810
 a cutter like maybe I mentioned it in 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.760
 some time previously the 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.490
 vegetation in thailand is a 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.560
 tropical vegetation but 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.690
 significantly thicker than the one that 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.280
 is located in South America therefore 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.520
 it is to be expected that this kind of 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.160
 machetes have the function of plotting 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.290
 branches are much thicker than those 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.660
 you have in center and south america 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.160
 an equivalent example would be the parana 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.160
 what do you have to realize 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.440
 you a very design 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.010
 with some pretty features 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.320
 similar obviously in this case to be 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.030
 industrial has some finishes 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.790
 quite better but in terms 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.910
 general for reasons of price and 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.370
 the legendary performance of the spider 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.830
 this is a very very competitive machete 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.770
 in general they will do them and have a time 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.580
 differential is to say that depending on 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:48.020
 the part of the sheet are more or less 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.080
 hard that's what is achieved by 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:54.020
 course with manufacturing and time 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:57.710
 by hand on the design I have already spoken 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.820
 the hollow handle is quite difficult to 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.740
 drive 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.440
 in the long term for reasons of 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:06.200
 ergonomics but in this case it does not have a 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.110
 full tang blade but it arrives 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.330
 approximately up here having a 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.580
 Insertion space of approximately 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.650
 an inch what is achieved with that is 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.980
 that a relatively light machete 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.710
 like this one that is between 400 and 600 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.440
 grams have a very good frontal balance 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.460
 as trozador but also the fact 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.860
 that the leaf 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.400
 do not go until the end of the handle helps 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.110
 absorb a lot of vibration 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.780
 during the impact unfortunately 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.910
 I have not used it yet but it's very 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.800
 soon to do a pilot test before 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.500
 the great test of machetes that 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:46.360
 seem to be completing all the 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.360
 pieces that I want to get to try
