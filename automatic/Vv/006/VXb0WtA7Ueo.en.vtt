00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
offers a field trip experience it was 14

offers a field trip experience it was 14
days<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.690> think<00:00:55.079> we<00:00:55.140> went<00:00:55.260> through<00:00:55.379> about<00:00:55.440> 20

to go each day how are the kids to get

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.840 
to go each day how are the kids to get
out<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.540> trip<00:01:15.860> the<00:01:16.860> idea<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.159> the

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
out of the trip the idea that the

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.149 
out of the trip the idea that the
weather<00:01:18.200> experienced<00:01:19.200> out<00:01:19.259> in<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.409> field<00:01:19.650> is

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
weather experienced out in the field is

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.410 
weather experienced out in the field is
really<00:01:20.430> completely<00:01:20.729> different<00:01:21.090> from<00:01:21.240> what

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
really completely different from what

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.090 
really completely different from what
you<00:01:21.509> see<00:01:21.689> on<00:01:22.439> your<00:01:22.470> computer<00:01:22.860> screen<00:01:22.979> you

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
you see on your computer screen you

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.950 
you see on your computer screen you
don't<00:01:23.250> really<00:01:23.369> get<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.610> full<00:01:23.850> appreciation<00:01:24.030> to

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
don't really get a full appreciation to

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.670 
don't really get a full appreciation to
actually<00:01:25.259> go<00:01:25.470> out<00:01:25.650> there<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.340> where<00:01:27.680> the

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
actually go out there to where the

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.380 
actually go out there to where the
weather<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:28.979> probably<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.700> most<00:01:29.820> extreme<00:01:30.180> and

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
weather is probably the most extreme and

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.260 
weather is probably the most extreme and
see<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.960> happen<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.530> really<00:01:32.520> learn<00:01:32.820> on<00:01:33.090> the

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
see it happen and really learn on the

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.859 
see it happen and really learn on the
spot<00:01:33.740> it's<00:01:34.740> really<00:01:35.070> hard<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:36.390> exactly

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
spot it's really hard to to exactly

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.899 
spot it's really hard to to exactly
capture<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.680> in<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:37.979> classroom<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.610> you

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
capture that in the classroom and you

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.219 
capture that in the classroom and you
just<00:01:39.119> see<00:01:39.240> everything<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.810> get<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.049> see<00:01:40.200> the

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
just see everything you get to see the

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.990 
just see everything you get to see the
entire<00:01:40.439> storm<00:01:40.950> from<00:01:41.100> top<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.340> bottom<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.820> it's

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
entire storm from top to bottom and it's

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.639 
entire storm from top to bottom and it's
just<00:01:42.150> an<00:01:42.270> amazing<00:01:42.390> feeling<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:43.229> don't<00:01:43.380> like<00:01:43.439> to

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
just an amazing feeling I don't like to

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:44.630 
just an amazing feeling I don't like to
think<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:43.950> as<00:01:44.070> getting<00:01:44.189> out<00:01:44.430> of<00:01:44.520> the

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
think of it as getting out of the
