to do next is I don't put the rice into

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.240 
to do next is I don't put the rice into
that<00:04:29.610> because<00:04:29.850> when<00:04:30.210> you<00:04:30.300> start<00:04:30.570> storing<00:04:30.930> it

it gets hard and then when you try to

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.170 
it gets hard and then when you try to
warm<00:04:34.260> it<00:04:34.410> up<00:04:34.530> it's<00:04:34.830> just<00:04:34.920> it's<00:04:35.340> nasty<00:04:35.730> right<00:04:35.760> so
