bird very very efficiently very quickly

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.069 
bird very very efficiently very quickly
so<00:00:40.489> we<00:00:40.609> built<00:00:40.850> this<00:00:40.940> very<00:00:41.149> robust<00:00:41.600> frame<00:00:41.870> and

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
so we built this very robust frame and

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:43.119 
so we built this very robust frame and
the<00:00:42.140> next<00:00:42.350> thing<00:00:42.500> that<00:00:42.530> we're<00:00:42.769> going<00:00:42.980> to<00:00:43.039> do

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
the next thing that we're going to do

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:44.439 
the next thing that we're going to do
when<00:00:43.340> we<00:00:43.370> piece<00:00:43.640> all<00:00:43.820> these<00:00:43.969> components

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:44.449 
when we piece all these components

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:46.959 
when we piece all these components
together<00:00:44.570> is<00:00:45.500> open<00:00:45.980> in<00:00:46.100> a<00:00:46.219> barrel<00:00:46.640> that<00:00:46.850> we've

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
together is open in a barrel that we've

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.439 
together is open in a barrel that we've
cut<00:00:47.210> from<00:00:47.480> a<00:00:47.629> 55-gallon<00:00:49.030> food-grade<00:00:50.030> barrel

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
cut from a 55-gallon food-grade barrel

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.450 
cut from a 55-gallon food-grade barrel
this<00:00:50.870> will<00:00:51.079> fit<00:00:51.260> very<00:00:51.469> snugly<00:00:52.010> that's<00:00:52.190> been

rounder a soft grade of rubber EPDM

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.060 
rounder a soft grade of rubber EPDM
rubber<00:01:16.810> what<00:01:17.810> happens<00:01:18.140> is<00:01:18.350> when<00:01:18.650> this<00:01:18.830> thing

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
rubber what happens is when this thing

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.410 
rubber what happens is when this thing
is<00:01:19.220> at<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:19.370> bottom<00:01:19.730> then<00:01:19.970> you<00:01:20.000> have<00:01:20.180> a<00:01:20.210> chicken

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
is at the bottom then you have a chicken

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.340 
is at the bottom then you have a chicken
in<00:01:20.630> there<00:01:20.810> and<00:01:21.110> it's<00:01:21.440> rotating<00:01:22.420> it<00:01:23.420> does<00:01:24.110> very

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
in there and it's rotating it does very

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.780 
in there and it's rotating it does very
quick<00:01:24.590> work<00:01:24.770> to<00:01:24.950> pull<00:01:25.130> all<00:01:25.250> the<00:01:25.370> feathers<00:01:25.670> off

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
then ready for the next station which is

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.720 
then ready for the next station which is
the<00:01:33.200> evisceration<00:01:33.440> or<00:01:34.010> the<00:01:34.070> cleaning<00:01:34.310> of<00:01:34.490> bird

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
we'll be be DIAC and a little bit here

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.080 
we'll be be DIAC and a little bit here
to<00:01:38.930> show<00:01:39.170> you<00:01:39.230> how<00:01:39.980> it<00:01:40.130> all<00:01:40.250> comes<00:01:40.520> together
