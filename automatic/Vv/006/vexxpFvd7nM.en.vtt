00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
I think it was Italy and see if you get

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.380 
I think it was Italy and see if you get
it<00:02:35.130> wrong<00:02:35.250> it<00:02:35.430> will<00:02:35.490> tell<00:02:35.700> you<00:02:35.850> and<00:02:36.000> again

those<00:02:36.600> sounds<00:02:36.930> get<00:02:37.080> really<00:02:37.410> irritating<00:02:37.920> after

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
those sounds get really irritating after

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.860

a<00:02:38.220> little<00:02:38.280> while<00:02:38.430> but<00:02:39.150> so<00:02:39.300> this<00:02:39.480> is<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:39.750> basic

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
a little while but so this is the basic

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.900 
a little while but so this is the basic
premise<00:02:40.320> you're<00:02:40.620> given<00:02:40.830> three<00:02:40.860> lives<00:02:41.280> when<00:02:41.880> we

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
premise you're given three lives when we

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.250 
premise you're given three lives when we
go<00:02:42.120> back<00:02:42.330> to<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.510> next<00:02:42.690> question<00:02:43.020> will<00:02:43.140> see

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260

go back to the next question will see
I've<00:02:43.350> got<00:02:43.380> hearts<00:02:43.770> on<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.070> top<00:02:44.250> that<00:02:44.460> Clooney

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
you're supposed to memorize as much as

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.540 
you're supposed to memorize as much as
possible<00:02:48.620> how<00:02:49.620> many<00:02:49.770> donations<00:02:50.040> have<00:02:50.400> you

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
possible how many donations have you

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
seen I wasn't paying terrible guessing

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.970 
seen I wasn't paying terrible guessing
but<00:02:54.720> are<00:02:54.900> you<00:02:54.990> get<00:02:55.110> three<00:02:55.320> chances<00:02:55.350> and<00:02:55.890> then

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
but are you get three chances and then

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.160 
but are you get three chances and then
hopefully<00:02:56.220> your<00:02:56.520> score<00:02:56.760> is<00:02:56.880> higher<00:02:57.390> by<00:02:58.050> the

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.020 
hopefully your score is higher by the
time<00:02:58.350> you<00:02:58.500> find<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.830> game<00:02:59.010> over<00:02:59.340> mine<00:02:59.880> usually

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
time you find the game over mine usually

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.870 
time you find the game over mine usually
wasn't<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.780> problem<00:03:01.170> is<00:03:01.350> that<00:03:01.560> a<00:03:01.880> you

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
wasn't and the problem is that a you

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.370 
wasn't and the problem is that a you
often<00:03:03.210> don't<00:03:03.330> know<00:03:03.480> what<00:03:03.600> you're<00:03:03.750> looking<00:03:04.080> for

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
often don't know what you're looking for

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.650 
often don't know what you're looking for
and<00:03:04.620> this<00:03:05.160> isn't<00:03:05.490> so<00:03:05.700> big<00:03:05.850> of<00:03:06.000> a<00:03:06.060> deal<00:03:06.240> if<00:03:06.480> the

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
and this isn't so big of a deal if the

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.580 
and this isn't so big of a deal if the
questions<00:03:07.080> are<00:03:07.230> consistent<00:03:08.720> but<00:03:09.720> you<00:03:09.840> know<00:03:09.990> it

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
questions are consistent but you know it

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.050 
questions are consistent but you know it
kind<00:03:10.980> of<00:03:11.010> runs<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.340> gambit<00:03:11.640> as<00:03:11.790> far<00:03:11.970> as

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
kind of runs the gambit as far as

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.550 
kind of runs the gambit as far as
sometimes<00:03:12.300> it's<00:03:12.720> you<00:03:12.840> know<00:03:12.960> how<00:03:13.110> many<00:03:13.260> people

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
sometimes it's you know how many people

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.170 
sometimes it's you know how many people
were<00:03:13.650> in<00:03:13.710> the<00:03:13.830> picture<00:03:14.160> and<00:03:14.640> that's<00:03:14.850> a<00:03:14.970> fairly

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
were in the picture and that's a fairly

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.090 
were in the picture and that's a fairly
easy<00:03:15.420> questions<00:03:15.960> when<00:03:16.230> you<00:03:16.260> you<00:03:16.830> know<00:03:16.860> can

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
easy questions when you you know can

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.590 
easy questions when you you know can
know<00:03:17.250> right<00:03:17.430> off<00:03:17.460> the<00:03:17.580> bat<00:03:17.700> you're<00:03:18.330> probably

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
know right off the bat you're probably

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.450 
know right off the bat you're probably
looking<00:03:19.050> for<00:03:19.080> but<00:03:19.440> then<00:03:19.560> sometimes<00:03:19.830> it's<00:03:20.250> like

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:20.460 
looking for but then sometimes it's like

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.680 
you know how many hairs of the guy in
the<00:03:22.620> third<00:03:22.890> you<00:03:23.430> know<00:03:23.550> third<00:03:23.790> left<00:03:24.090> half<00:03:24.360> and

the third you know third left half and
it's<00:03:24.840> it's<00:03:25.260> kind<00:03:25.560> of<00:03:25.590> out<00:03:25.710> of<00:03:25.740> left<00:03:25.920> field<00:03:26.040> it's

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
it's it's kind of out of left field it's

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.460 
it's it's kind of out of left field it's
a<00:03:26.550> bit<00:03:26.700> hard<00:03:26.910> to<00:03:26.970> do<00:03:27.270> especially<00:03:27.930> when<00:03:28.410> you

you're playing and that's kind of the

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.420 
you're playing and that's kind of the
problem<00:03:30.720> if<00:03:31.650> I<00:03:31.740> were<00:03:31.830> to<00:03:31.920> suggest<00:03:32.100> anything

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
look for a small details questions or

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.430 
look for a small details questions or
maybe<00:03:39.000> counting<00:03:39.510> questions<00:03:40.020> or<00:03:40.230> you<00:03:40.350> know

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
maybe counting questions or you know

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.350 
maybe counting questions or you know
even<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.830> minor<00:03:41.010> differences<00:03:41.550> questions

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
even the minor differences questions

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.510 
even the minor differences questions
would<00:03:42.510> be<00:03:42.630> good<00:03:42.780> just<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.830> ability<00:03:43.890> to<00:03:44.280> filter

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
would be good just the ability to filter

would be good just the ability to filter
the<00:03:44.760> photos<00:03:45.060> out<00:03:45.240> would<00:03:45.390> kind<00:03:45.690> of<00:03:45.750> give<00:03:45.900> you

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 
the photos out would kind of give you

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.630 
the photos out would kind of give you
more<00:03:46.200> of<00:03:46.230> a<00:03:46.350> clue<00:03:46.560> as<00:03:46.710> to<00:03:46.950> what<00:03:47.160> you're<00:03:47.310> looking

gameplay<00:03:49.650> the<00:03:49.830> pacing<00:03:50.250> is<00:03:50.310> well<00:03:50.520> could<00:03:50.700> be

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
gameplay the pacing is well could be

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.700 
gameplay the pacing is well could be
slightly<00:03:51.090> better<00:03:51.360> whereas<00:03:52.140> to<00:03:52.290> start<00:03:52.620> out

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:52.710 
slightly better whereas to start out

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
with easier questions and then work your

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.300 
with easier questions and then work your
way<00:03:54.120> up<00:03:54.270> to<00:03:54.390> more<00:03:54.720> difficult<00:03:54.900> ones<00:03:55.410> this<00:03:56.070> kind

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
way up to more difficult ones this kind

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.550 
way up to more difficult ones this kind
of<00:03:56.430> giving<00:03:56.670> a<00:03:56.730> crescendo<00:03:56.940> effect<00:03:57.660> to<00:03:57.900> the<00:03:58.080> the

would<00:04:01.230> say<00:04:01.440> this<00:04:01.590> gets<00:04:01.860> stale<00:04:02.130> not<00:04:03.030> too

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300
