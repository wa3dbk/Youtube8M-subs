YouTube comments have been moved to
Google+<00:02:44.190> and<00:02:44.430> I<00:02:44.520> don't<00:02:44.670> have<00:02:44.790> that<00:02:44.820> down<00:02:45.180> yet

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
Google+ and I don't have that down yet

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.240 
Google+ and I don't have that down yet
and<00:02:45.690> I<00:02:45.780> think<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:46.020> lot<00:02:46.050> of<00:02:46.170> people<00:02:46.290> don't<00:02:46.770> it's

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
and I think a lot of people don't it's

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.850 
and I think a lot of people don't it's
all<00:02:47.460> brand<00:02:47.760> new<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:48.410> Google<00:02:49.410> just<00:02:49.620> kind<00:02:49.800> of

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
all brand new and Google just kind of

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.040 
all brand new and Google just kind of
sprung<00:02:50.220> it<00:02:50.370> on<00:02:50.460> us<00:02:50.520> so<00:02:51.450> I'm<00:02:51.660> really<00:02:51.900> going<00:02:51.990> to

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
sprung it on us so I'm really going to

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.960 
sprung it on us so I'm really going to
miss<00:02:52.140> that<00:02:52.410> part<00:02:52.680> I<00:02:52.950> think<00:02:53.370> eventually<00:02:53.550> we

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
miss that part I think eventually we

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.340 
miss that part I think eventually we
will<00:02:54.090> be<00:02:54.240> able<00:02:54.300> to<00:02:54.480> settle<00:02:54.690> into<00:02:54.990> this<00:02:55.140> new

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
will be able to settle into this new

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.290 
will be able to settle into this new
system<00:02:55.620> and<00:02:56.010> be<00:02:56.100> able<00:02:56.160> to<00:02:56.310> interact<00:02:56.850> the<00:02:57.180> way

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
system and be able to interact the way

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.150 
system and be able to interact the way
we<00:02:57.420> used<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:57.750> but<00:02:58.350> until<00:02:58.650> then<00:02:58.770> I'm<00:02:58.950> going<00:02:59.100> to

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
we used to but until then I'm going to

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.950 
we used to but until then I'm going to
miss<00:02:59.280> that<00:02:59.340> but<00:03:00.210> I'm<00:03:00.330> sure<00:03:00.480> we'll<00:03:00.510> figure<00:03:00.810> out

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
miss that but I'm sure we'll figure out

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.410 
miss that but I'm sure we'll figure out
a<00:03:01.110> way<00:03:01.290> to<00:03:01.350> do<00:03:02.190> that<00:03:02.340> again<00:03:02.670> but<00:03:02.850> that<00:03:03.000> to<00:03:03.150> me<00:03:03.180> is

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
a way to do that again but that to me is

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.570 
a way to do that again but that to me is
the<00:03:03.450> most<00:03:03.570> important<00:03:04.500> and<00:03:04.739> fun<00:03:05.070> thing<00:03:05.370> about

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
the most important and fun thing about

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.690 
the most important and fun thing about
making<00:03:06.300> videos<00:03:06.750> so<00:03:07.410> I<00:03:07.440> look<00:03:07.650> forward<00:03:07.680> to<00:03:08.040> more

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
making videos so I look forward to more
