women<00:00:08.849> have<00:00:09.030> breast<00:00:09.300> reduction<00:00:10.170> surgery

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
women have breast reduction surgery

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.789 
women have breast reduction surgery
because<00:00:11.370> their<00:00:11.670> breasts<00:00:12.330> are<00:00:12.900> large<00:00:13.230> and<00:00:13.679> it

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
because their breasts are large and it

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.240 
because their breasts are large and it
starts<00:00:14.130> to<00:00:14.219> impact<00:00:14.519> their<00:00:14.820> life<00:00:15.980> not<00:00:16.980> only

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
starts to impact their life not only

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.730 
starts to impact their life not only
does<00:00:17.430> it<00:00:17.460> impact<00:00:17.820> their<00:00:18.199> activities<00:00:19.199> but<00:00:19.560> it

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
does it impact their activities but it

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.720 
does it impact their activities but it
also<00:00:19.920> impacts<00:00:20.910> their<00:00:21.300> bodies<00:00:22.250> in<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.430> sense

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
also impacts their bodies in the sense

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.109 
also impacts their bodies in the sense
of<00:00:23.910> having<00:00:24.090> neck<00:00:24.930> pains<00:00:25.289> back<00:00:26.160> pains<00:00:26.189> their

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
of having neck pains back pains their

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.279 
of having neck pains back pains their
posture<00:00:27.630> starts<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.439> go<00:00:28.640> forward<00:00:30.289> very

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
posture starts to go forward very

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.340 
posture starts to go forward very
difficult<00:00:32.180> with<00:00:33.180> clothing<00:00:33.809> sometimes

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
difficult with clothing sometimes

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.350 
difficult with clothing sometimes
finding<00:00:35.010> bras<00:00:35.340> can<00:00:35.790> be<00:00:35.969> extremely<00:00:36.960> hard<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:38.129> do

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
finding bras can be extremely hard to do

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.979 
finding bras can be extremely hard to do
so<00:00:39.360> for<00:00:39.690> us<00:00:39.750> reduction<00:00:40.320> surgery<00:00:40.829> is<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:42.059> way

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
so for us reduction surgery is a way

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.740 
so for us reduction surgery is a way
that<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.290> woman<00:00:43.620> can<00:00:44.010> improve<00:00:44.460> their<00:00:44.750> lifestyle

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
that a woman can improve their lifestyle

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.770 
that a woman can improve their lifestyle
there<00:00:46.620> are<00:00:46.800> definitely<00:00:47.539> different<00:00:48.539> type<00:00:48.750> of

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
there are definitely different type of

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.529 
there are definitely different type of
breast<00:00:49.320> reductions<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.489> plastic<00:00:51.030> surgeons

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
breast reductions that plastic surgeons

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.029 
breast reductions that plastic surgeons
perform<00:00:53.510> it<00:00:54.510> has<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.110> do<00:00:55.230> primarily<00:00:55.410> with<00:00:55.829> how

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
perform it has to do primarily with how

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.430 
perform it has to do primarily with how
large<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.789> woman<00:00:57.180> is<00:00:57.559> and<00:00:59.719> there<00:01:00.719> are<00:01:00.899> short

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
large a woman is and there are short

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.399 
large a woman is and there are short
scar<00:01:01.739> techniques<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.969> there<00:01:03.210> are<00:01:03.409> long

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
scar techniques and there are long

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.320 
scar techniques and there are long
scarred<00:01:04.920> techniques<00:01:06.950> we<00:01:07.950> are<00:01:08.250> always<00:01:08.850> going

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
scarred techniques we are always going

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.600 
scarred techniques we are always going
towards<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.110> short<00:01:10.380> scar<00:01:10.619> technique<00:01:11.159> as<00:01:11.310> much

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
towards a short scar technique as much

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.880 
towards a short scar technique as much
as<00:01:12.320> safety<00:01:13.320> will<00:01:13.560> allow<00:01:14.010> us<00:01:14.390> so<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.590> take<00:01:16.590> time

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
as safety will allow us so I take time

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.020 
as safety will allow us so I take time
and<00:01:17.580> explain<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.360> woman<00:01:19.460> which<00:01:20.460> techniques

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
and explain to a woman which techniques

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.740 
and explain to a woman which techniques
are<00:01:21.240> most<00:01:21.840> safe<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:23.100> it's<00:01:23.670> used<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.030> ours<00:01:24.450> a

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
are most safe and it's used to ours a

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.560 
are most safe and it's used to ours a
short<00:01:25.049> scar<00:01:25.259> technique<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:26.100> really<00:01:26.880> not<00:01:27.270> the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
short scar technique is really not the

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.350 
short scar technique is really not the
best<00:01:27.780> alternative<00:01:28.729> because<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.909> one<00:01:30.090> thing

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
best alternative because the one thing

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.090 
best alternative because the one thing
in<00:01:30.600> this<00:01:30.780> type<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.020> surgery<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.680> don't<00:01:31.860> want

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
in this type of surgery you don't want

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.999 
in this type of surgery you don't want
complications<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.270> want<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.570> minimize<00:01:34.350> them

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
complications you want to minimize them

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.640 
complications you want to minimize them
as<00:01:35.250> much<00:01:35.640> as<00:01:35.939> possible<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:37.790> the<00:01:38.790> short<00:01:39.210> scar<00:01:39.650> or

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
as much as possible so the short scar or

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.899 
as much as possible so the short scar or
long<00:01:41.009> straw<00:01:41.430> technique<00:01:42.119> really<00:01:42.540> depends<00:01:43.110> on

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
long straw technique really depends on

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.100 
long straw technique really depends on
the<00:01:44.909> size<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.630> woman<00:01:46.049> is<00:01:46.259> on<00:01:46.670> presentation<00:01:47.670> and

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
the size a woman is on presentation and

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.139 
the size a woman is on presentation and
what<00:01:49.110> she<00:01:49.380> is<00:01:49.500> trying<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.979> create<00:01:50.399> in<00:01:50.549> terms<00:01:50.579> of

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
what she is trying to create in terms of

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.260 
what she is trying to create in terms of
his<00:01:51.299> shape<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.439> takes<00:01:52.890> some<00:01:53.270> artistic

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
his shape and that takes some artistic

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.380 
his shape and that takes some artistic
talent<00:01:55.140> on<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.490> behalf<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.850> plastic

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
talent on the behalf of the plastic

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.810 
talent on the behalf of the plastic
surgeon<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:58.049> try<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.320> create<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:59.009> the

recovery for a breast reduction in
general<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.729> fairly<00:02:03.090> easy<00:02:03.329> in<00:02:04.040> general<00:02:05.040> it

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
general is fairly easy in general it

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.649 
general is fairly easy in general it
should<00:02:05.460> not<00:02:05.670> be<00:02:06.000> painful

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659
