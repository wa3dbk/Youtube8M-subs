00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.549
 sign 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.490
 everybody will come here in size 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.620
 giga revolver errors are here for 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.360
 give you my general classification 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.640
 regarding the weapons before de 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:23.380
 exotic in destiny 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:27.079
 I remember only the ranking's primary weapons 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:29.960
 formed only for statistics on TV is 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:34.700
 then against the various outcast type mobs 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:37.250
 slave stilettos to the general aton a 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.940
 ask why then the primary money 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.560
 which are 13 and times I will list the various 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.080
 strengths and weaknesses and to be able to 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.860
 basic universal remote control this a 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.810
 Shotgun 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.940
 but as you well know to take place 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.860
 primary trani own many guns 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.040
 pump the big flaw is the city ​​knows 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.680
 so if we kill one we should 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.530
 vc is born a lot so they risk suffering 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.510
 a melee over nothing is a gun 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.059
 precision and like the remote control 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.369
 universal we could only use it as 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.040
 primary weapon this weapon possesses one 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.170
 great range and considerable impact but a 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.299
 defect standards that do not compensate for 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.060
 nothing the advantages previously loosened 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:19.159
 the flaw is that it is not symptomatic like 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.319
 all other destiny snipers but it's a 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.609
 single shot then every shot fired 

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:25.630
 we should put a shot in the barrel 

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:25.630
 wasting a lot of time 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.170
 hard light to this weapon is a rifle 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:32.960
 automatic suffering from a competition 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.360
 pitiless of surus montecarlo is black 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.720
 case months statistics do immediately 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.700
 note that it has an excellent rate of fire 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.659
 but it is not compensated with the number of 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.100
 shots in the charger in the port and range 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.470
 things that I consider fundamental in a 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.939
 automatic rifle in Italy to a good one 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.590
 stability with regard to 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:55.580
 effects there is nothing particularly 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.950
 in the exam the last word of one of the 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.020
 three portable dogs 12 in the game 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.179
 you are here are a cadence of little 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.390
 automatic great because last 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:07.909
 word that followed it and damage 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.369
 when shooting point-blank increasing 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.230
 also the damage from precision therefore it is 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.989
 very useful if you don't have a big way 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.640
 you can have little or no range 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.920
 makes it dangerous in large medium 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.150
 distances 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.270
 the way to play but it's a pulse gun 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.510
 this formidable weapon against groups 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.459
 of enemies who have their own life ad 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.260
 example one hour of the excavations this because 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.630
 has a why of the name mario says 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.790
 a chain that kills us every time 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.350
 the cradle will be reloaded automatically and 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.810
 will increase the damage inflicted for a short time 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.280
 period to say about insignificant use if 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.650
 it is not used against a group of enemies 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.140
 scarce since it does not do much damage 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:50.550
 lasted invited only valid in small 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:52.440
 never away and multi moist tool 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.810
 while not having much impact and a weapon 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.930
 devastating thanks to its cadence of 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:01.170
 fire and its range this weapon la 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.560
 reta meet stronger than the ppp husbands 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.150
 mine is preferable to use other weapons 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.190
 useful because the third eye is the 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.060
 because multi tool drives but with 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:14.010
 many everything before and for the dtt micro 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.500
 clear is an automatic rifle that 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.440
 inflicts arc damage to statistics 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.600
 is nothing that but the real boost 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.820
 the estimates thanks to yours because the 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.400
 telemetry that joins the dark mind 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.709
 well with door but edition for those not 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.290
 knew the steps brought to the editions 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:34.110
 that to every enemy killed with a blow 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.180
 critical has a probability magnitude than 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.350
 cause an explosion as if it were a 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:42.080
 exploded slave creating huge damage 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.720
 and would embarrass even the time was 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.540
 a crime because dragonfly in montecarlo 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.720
 and an automatic rifle of statistics 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.580
 it soon becomes clear that it is certainly not 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.850
 standard to be used against enemies 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:59.720
 toast like a colossus any other 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:02.720
 however greater as the black qasmo 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.360
 has a perk method montecarlo that is 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.250
 very useful since doing my today 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.320
 giving enemies with this weapon will cause 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.690
 in the middle of your war 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.750
 body to body santer that every decision 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.730
 about you should get your bonus back 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.040
 very useful melee because 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.160
 he would then agree on his own guardian 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.690
 use a happy content 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.970
 unruly intellect is the only flaw 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.510
 of the weapon that has its own result 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.510
 of impact 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.470
 the red deaths and a rifle to establish themselves in 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.450
 has a great impact with 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.250
 shake these characteristics cadence 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:40.250
 they are quite rare for an exit of 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.320
 impulses the only one if regimen is a rifle 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.810
 automatic and without a shadow of a doubt is one 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.880
 of the strong weapons of the game features 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.800
 a large and even cadences of fire with 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.610
 the effects of the loose favor a 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.550
 great impact 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:55.820
 a hymn named range and a stability 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.950
 in short, a deadly weapon with the controcazzi 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.290
 and to make matters worse, he also has 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:04.280
 one of the perk engines now we enter the 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:07.640
 podium in third place we find the ass from 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.200
 ass and a portable cannon can 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.390
 deceive two reservists who are 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.000
 inferior to all al teknon i 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:17.030
 exotic portals but because of aa 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.700
 dance the enemies and make them fearful against 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.590
 any opponent 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:24.440
 in second place we find the myth crest 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.450
 rex my toklas tav ex is a rifle a 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.940
 fusion that we will use as primary 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.990
 causes sun damage and is unique in his 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.790
 gender 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.100
 has an unusual escape rate 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:36.290
 in the branch of the few the iea fusion put 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.640
 usually own bullets to the area 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.590
 such as shotguns 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.320
 but invitation class instead uses one 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.840
 different rate of fire since it shoots 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.910
 single shot as if it were a rifle 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.419
 automatic has a great recovery 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.160
 unbelievable 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:51.759
 in a time and egypt is a good one 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.560
 stability 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:56.889
 however it expresses its full potential 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:59.979
 investigated but in pt and is always a big one 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:01.690
 weapon has a single flaw with just a few strokes 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:04.810
 in general even if we complain about the 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:07.539
 charger and in first place we find the 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:10.270
 fall crown the fall is not 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:13.030
 just a portable fee but it's the cannon 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:17.259
 laptop has an impressive 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:19.750
 impact range excellent stability is one 

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:23.050
 good rate of fire but because it deserves 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.430
 to arrive first come nor the perks that 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.440
 they are passers-by 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.320
 in short, three shots in our charger 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.870
 they did extensive damage to enemies 

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:33.940
 example a critic with the huge 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:36.010
 equals about 4 critics without substantial 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:38.020
 good that the boys' video is over 

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:40.570
 I hope you enjoyed it 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:42.460
 tell me a little also in the comments of the 

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:44.740
 your ranking of your will 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:49.419
 exotic remember that the ranking is 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:51.550
 totally like saying personal then there 

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:53.790
 it may be that people may not like it 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:57.300
 this reissue of the 

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:58.830
 so guys a little what do you think of 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:01.920
 this ranking mixed criville 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:05.060
 defined the latter even if you know it 

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:07.860
 that I make another video on 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:11.250
 best secondary exotic of the game o 

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:13.530
 tertiary to make legendary the 

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:16.140
 primary type compare the weapons of the 

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:18.480
 time than those in the raid 

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:20.730
 of the end of crotta the themes you what 

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:24.590
 you would like to see in the future and we will 

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:24.590
 let's see the next nice video
