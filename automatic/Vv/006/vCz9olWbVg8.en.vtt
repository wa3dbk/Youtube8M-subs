00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:18.210
 cut a slice of pineapple 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:21.740
 we remove the shore more or less a thick 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.740
 of this verse 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.720
 we cut it we are going to remove the shell 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:44.470
 and I put it complete with everything and 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:46.720
 center of the pineapple ok let's go putting 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:50.080
 the ingredients we are going to put in local 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.750
 a stalk of whole cactus 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.620
 Y 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.420
 the average size does not have to be before 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.670
 a slice of celery 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.580
 only the buoy 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.820
 starting in some parts so that between 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.820
 all right 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.410
 a little bit of parsley 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.540
 I'm going to split the grapefruit to get 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:20.500
 only the juice 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.500
 we squeeze it 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.340
 direct 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.760
 okay 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.980
 ok now let's peel the orange this 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.190
 I'm not going to leave 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:56.850
 I want to peel it alone and try to 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:03:00.430
 put him with everything and then what is 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:03.659
 can be left of the white of the shell 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.659
 and this is very good 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.280
 They peel easier when the peel 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.690
 it's a little thick, like this 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.800
 when you come skinny, you battled 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.240
 a little more 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:20.870
 it would sound like pure ready only 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.870
 I'm going to start 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.780
 I take away the little seeds that 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.110
 it has nothing to do with putting them on 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.940
 but 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.950
 we are going to do it and this is going to give us 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.480
 much more 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.500
 okay 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.500
 we close well 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.849
 and we're going to liquefy everything so that it 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:45.330
 incorporate the ingredients well and 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.330
 make the juice 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:26.530
 I'm going to lower it a little 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:29.320
 to put some crimes so that 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:32.080
 dismiss the richest if I put a lot 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:36.300
 Much is done as a paper I do not want it 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.300
 so much, but there they go 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.640
 and are ready 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.870
 we'll see 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.010
 let's try better 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.620
 a gift from a friend 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.610
 ah 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.540
 Health 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.870
 well, I really recommend the truth 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:24.030
 that you do that you try it is going to 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:25.980
 love you will feel very good you 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:28.260
 you're going to feel disinflated you're going to 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.540
 feeling satisfied is not going to give you 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:33.270
 You can replace it with hunger 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.980
 for breakfast if you do not have 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.410
 time for more 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:41.100
 and it will also help you lose weight 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:43.640
 and remember to like and share for 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.640
