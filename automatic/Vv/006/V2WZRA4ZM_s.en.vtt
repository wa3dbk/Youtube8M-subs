I<00:00:09.980> basically<00:00:10.980> have<00:00:11.280> technique<00:00:11.700> broken<00:00:12.090> into

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
I basically have technique broken into

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.160 
I basically have technique broken into
four<00:00:12.570> categories<00:00:13.460> one<00:00:14.460> is<00:00:14.820> scaler<00:00:15.420> or<00:00:15.750> linear

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
four categories one is scaler or linear

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.019 
four categories one is scaler or linear
examples<00:00:16.800> 2<00:00:17.369> is<00:00:18.410> arpeggiated<00:00:19.410> examples<00:00:20.220> 3<00:00:20.880> is

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
examples 2 is arpeggiated examples 3 is

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.779 
examples 2 is arpeggiated examples 3 is
left<00:00:21.330> hand<00:00:21.570> or<00:00:21.810> legato<00:00:22.109> playing<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:22.920> 4<00:00:23.609> is

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.080 
left hand or legato playing and 4 is
sweet<00:00:24.060> picking<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:25.080> what<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.590> do<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.910> have

section and then when it comes time to

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.490 
section and then when it comes time to
practice<00:00:47.360> instead<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.570> saying<00:00:48.840> oh<00:00:49.050> there's

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
practice instead of saying oh there's

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.950 
practice instead of saying oh there's
millions<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.460> things<00:00:50.750> how<00:00:51.750> am<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:51.899> gonna

millions of things how am I gonna

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.650 
millions of things how am I gonna
practice<00:00:52.230> all<00:00:52.469> this<00:00:52.620> stuff<00:00:53.090> basically<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.210> make

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
practice all this stuff basically I make

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.720 
practice all this stuff basically I make
a<00:00:54.690> master<00:00:55.320> list<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.860> what's<00:00:56.250> in<00:00:56.399> all<00:00:56.550> those

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
a master list of what's in all those

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.900 
a master list of what's in all those
files<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.109> list<00:00:58.489> changes<00:00:59.489> from<00:00:59.640> day<00:00:59.850> to

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
files and that list changes from day to

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.810 
files and that list changes from day to
day<00:01:00.030> yet<00:01:00.420> constantly<00:01:00.989> add<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:02.579> sit

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
day yet constantly add to it and you sit

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.000 
day yet constantly add to it and you sit
down<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.719> basically<00:01:04.110> customize<00:01:04.320> a

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
down and you basically customize a

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.760 
down and you basically customize a
practice<00:01:05.939> session<00:01:06.150> so<00:01:07.080> let's<00:01:07.110> say<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.650> have

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
practice session so let's say you have

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.520 
practice session so let's say you have
about<00:01:07.950> 2<00:01:08.220> hours<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.729> practice<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:09.530> personally

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
about 2 hours to practice I personally

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.300 
about 2 hours to practice I personally
have<00:01:10.650> 4<00:01:10.860> categories<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.939> pick<00:01:12.510> one<00:01:12.780> item

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
have 4 categories so I pick one item

the note a flat and your right hand is
picking<00:02:26.989> once<00:02:27.620> again<00:02:27.920> down<00:02:28.340> up<00:02:28.670> down<00:02:29.090> up<00:02:33.819> now

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
picking once again down up down up now

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.670 
picking once again down up down up now
the<00:02:34.910> next<00:02:35.209> step<00:02:35.390> is<00:02:35.540> to<00:02:35.690> simply<00:02:36.140> flip<00:02:36.530> your

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
the next step is to simply flip your

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.699 
the next step is to simply flip your
hand<00:02:36.980> sort<00:02:37.730> of<00:02:37.790> like<00:02:37.910> a<00:02:37.940> mirror<00:02:38.299> image<00:02:38.390> so<00:02:39.260> your

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
hand sort of like a mirror image so your

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.250 
hand sort of like a mirror image so your
first<00:02:39.980> finger<00:02:40.340> is<00:02:40.400> now<00:02:40.640> on<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.600> high<00:02:41.780> E<00:02:41.810> and

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
first finger is now on the high E and

combine<00:02:54.860> the<00:02:55.069> two

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.610 

what<00:03:06.209> I<00:03:06.239> did<00:03:06.420> after<00:03:06.540> that<00:03:06.689> is<00:03:06.989> I<00:03:07.109> a<00:03:07.139> scented

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
what I did after that is I a scented

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.470 
what I did after that is I a scented
chromatically<00:03:08.159> and<00:03:08.519> you<00:03:08.999> should<00:03:09.209> take<00:03:09.359> this

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
chromatically and you should take this

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.989 
chromatically and you should take this
all<00:03:09.689> the<00:03:09.780> way<00:03:09.870> up<00:03:09.989> to<00:03:10.139> the<00:03:10.230> 12th<00:03:10.620> fret<00:03:10.799> and<00:03:11.189> then

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:11.999 
all the way up to the 12th fret and then

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:15.289 
all the way up to the 12th fret and then
descend<00:03:12.650> using<00:03:13.650> a<00:03:13.859> similar<00:03:14.849> but<00:03:15.150> slightly

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
descend using a similar but slightly

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:30.429 
descend using a similar but slightly
different<00:03:15.629> pattern<00:03:16.200> here's<00:03:17.040> how<00:03:17.189> it<00:03:17.310> goes

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:30.439 

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:32.750 

okay<00:03:31.439> all<00:03:31.560> I<00:03:31.590> did<00:03:31.829> there<00:03:32.069> is<00:03:32.099> instead<00:03:32.700> of

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
okay all I did there is instead of

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.959 
okay all I did there is instead of
starting<00:03:33.359> on<00:03:33.569> the<00:03:34.019> first<00:03:34.290> finger<00:03:34.590> and<00:03:34.969> a

sending one two three four we started on

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.569 
sending one two three four we started on
the<00:03:39.180> pinky<00:03:39.599> on<00:03:39.780> the<00:03:40.379> high<00:03:40.560> E<00:03:40.590> and<00:03:41.069> D<00:03:41.189> scented

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
the pinky on the high E and D scented

once<00:03:46.620> again<00:03:46.769> picking<00:03:47.129> alternately<00:03:47.760> and<00:03:48.030> then

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
once again picking alternately and then

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.149 
once again picking alternately and then
we<00:03:48.719> reversed<00:03:49.139> that<00:03:49.680> image<00:03:50.040> like<00:03:50.669> a<00:03:50.699> mirror<00:03:51.090> and

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:52.159 
we reversed that image like a mirror and

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:54.589 
we reversed that image like a mirror and
started<00:03:53.159> on<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.370> fourth<00:03:53.730> finger<00:03:53.969> once<00:03:54.269> again

alternate picking through string skips
make<00:04:16.209> sure<00:04:16.480> that<00:04:17.290> your<00:04:17.470> right<00:04:17.650> hand<00:04:17.950> picking

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
make sure that your right hand picking

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.550 
make sure that your right hand picking
is<00:04:18.519> very<00:04:18.730> accurate<00:04:19.030> and<00:04:19.540> that<00:04:20.079> you<00:04:20.169> keep<00:04:20.350> your

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
pic close to the strings so you don't

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.550 
pic close to the strings so you don't
hit<00:04:22.600> the<00:04:22.810> string<00:04:23.080> that<00:04:23.230> you're<00:04:23.350> actually

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
hit the string that you're actually

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.270 
hit the string that you're actually
skipping<00:04:24.160> it's<00:04:25.060> called<00:04:25.330> efficiency<00:04:25.840> of

skipping it's called efficiency of
motion<00:04:27.280> now<00:04:28.060> you<00:04:28.900> should<00:04:29.080> also<00:04:29.260> practice<00:04:29.620> the

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
motion now you should also practice the

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.909 
motion now you should also practice the
same<00:04:30.220> exact<00:04:30.610> exercise<00:04:31.150> starting<00:04:32.110> an<00:04:32.230> upstroke

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
same exact exercise starting an upstroke

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:36.350 
same exact exercise starting an upstroke
as<00:04:33.160> well<00:04:34.290> to<00:04:35.290> make<00:04:35.410> sure<00:04:35.470> that<00:04:35.770> you're

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
as well to make sure that you're

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:52.950 
as well to make sure that you're
ambidextrous<00:04:51.120> that<00:04:52.120> was<00:04:52.270> a<00:04:52.300> slight<00:04:52.600> variation

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
ambidextrous that was a slight variation

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.440 
ambidextrous that was a slight variation
on<00:04:53.290> the<00:04:53.440> exercise<00:04:53.889> that<00:04:53.919> we<00:04:54.280> just<00:04:54.520> did<00:04:54.760> instead
