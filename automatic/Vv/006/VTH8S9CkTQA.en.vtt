00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.410
 This is the msi GX7 three cc 26 en 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.269
 large 17.3 laptop that is really intended 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.590
 for gaming with a quad core to 13 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:11.420
 processor 8 gigabytes of memory 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.010
 for playing a new game 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.630
 naturally crafting 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.070
 watch photos and videos and all sorts 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.390
 types of media full hd but on the 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.410
 everyday things like or is and 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.730
 internet 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.900
 first we take a look at material 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.850
 of this laptop man who will blind you there 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.550
 just a little out at the top 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.260
 we see a plastic on the side and 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.060
 now the middle is an aluminum 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.619
 also on them just separate look indicates 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.899
 this laptop here we of course see it 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.629
 msi gaming series logo illuminated in the middle 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:37.550
 By the way, occasionally it indicates him 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:38.809
 the top of a nice feel and 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.760
 You still have a bit of that on the side 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.019
 plastic fell and at the bottom we see 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.699
 in principle not so much tension 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:44.899
 above that the battery is for amber and 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:46.100
 that which is a quick store break so that you 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.559
 All parts of you have a lot 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.079
 can easily replace 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.119
 this is an msi as a rule 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.459
 she did some things lately and 

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:57.319
 more compact gaming apps' released 

00:00:55.459 --> 00:01:00.799
 this how not belong to him yet 

00:00:57.319 --> 00:01:02.899
 is 5.5 centimeters thick and almost four kilos 

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:04.820
 it is really a lot bigger and heavier 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.170
 then usually 17 inches 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.329
 but that makes sense in itself 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.640
 since specs are really in it 

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:12.829
 being top-of-the-line makes it real 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.539
 less suitable for a normal one 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:16.009
 air or one in a briefcase 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:17.359
 if you want to transport this you would 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.679
 really need a special bag 

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:20.119
 purchase 

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:21.890
 he sat a while with it 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.869
 screen old so that you get an idea of 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.070
 how big the screen is and so 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.359
 you can see that on the side and 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.799
 slightly flared at the top 

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:30.140
 another one and a half times 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:31.399
 surface just normal a4tje 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.380
 that screen that is in it is a full hd 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.240
 anti-glare screen just remember that 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.530
 can also see indirect light well 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.119
 what happens to your image you give me something 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.859
 less full of bright colors then 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.179
 for example a glossy screen 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:43.100
 the top of the screen is of course 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:44.810
 the after the reason webcam he has a the 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.179
 now communicated on the side of the 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.710
 keyboard and a beautiful processed in the 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:50.240
 design tip number two physical buttons 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.859
 but of course always for your games 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.990
 and wireless and wired mouse on the labs 

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:55.460
 when closing that keyboard what is in it 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.649
 is of course the steelseries keyboard 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.869
 can be set to 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.429
 16.8 million colors with the steel series 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.780
 engine that just download 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:04.330
 then you can do all different 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.890
 buttons to people setting 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.170
 a different color or a beautiful pattern 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.149
 show of letter hour in 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.770
 He is an HDMI and VGA display port and 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.630
 Bibi remember that you put it on all sorts 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.400
 types of monitors can connect and even 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.230
 can stream to other devices that 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.940
 also who supports them with full HD 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.320
 content is of course pretty cool if 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.510
 you for example games by our theme 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.010
 it has a usb 3 port and 2 three times 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.030
 times 2 point 0 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.130
 then you can do with all kinds of you 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.630
 just plug it in directly 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.850
 we find the laptop one in terabytes 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.750
 72 hour rpm drive and then the 820 hunger 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.310
 ssd 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.990
 did it at lightning speed by type and real 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.130
 very short later on 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.750
 games 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.470
 the video card that is in it is a third 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.390
 9 times, DNA is real 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.470
 really a thick video card and is real 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.180
