 hello friends tonight they youtube 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.300
 Let's explain how to connect your tablet 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:14.839
 to your television first I want 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:16.199
 tell them that the tablet is a tablet 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:21.420
 10.1 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:23.060
 samsung with android system 4.0 point 4 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.840
 or something like that 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.580
 there are many people who are having 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.560
 problems I was one of them who did not 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.420
 I could find exactly how 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.859
 could connect your tablet we had 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.250
 tried in one way or another and not 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.370
 we had been able to do that on this day 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.160
 we are going to explain you simply in 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.940
 simple steps how to do it 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:48.180
 first we have the adapter that is 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.760
 a hdtv adapter of course from samsung 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.129
 I do not know which others are in the market 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.930
 this one that I currently received from 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:01.350
 part of the store and simply because 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.880
 come I have a sony google that is 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.130
 television 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:09.270
 and we have here that the area and has the 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:13.020
 input from hm that input from 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.840
 Cable definition is this that 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:20.460
 normally we all use and of course 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:24.670
 then we have the adapter here 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.680
 exactly this this caves in mind 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:31.380
 tell them that when they receive the cable what 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.380
 they receive so they receive it like this 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:40.750
 as you come and first connect 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:45.340
 what is the high definition cable in 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:50.200
 this part of the connection remember the 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:53.619
 connection cable to the load has to 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:57.009
 be connected here if you connect 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:02:00.970
 the tablet here will not give you anything in 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:04.610
 tv and if we watch TV there 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:09.259
 we have nothing there absolutely nothing 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:12.110
 and you have to connect the power to 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:15.370
 this because this works with power like this 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.370
 that if you connect it here 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.579
 Automatically forgive we 're going to 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:22.590
 back to disconnect and we will return 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:27.980
 to connect 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.980
 here is going to produce that sound 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.659
 magical up 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.100
 you can manage your tablet from 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:37.540
 here yes 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.459
 and they can do everything else 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.939
 and that's all youtube friends 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.859
 any question then leave your 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:47.189
