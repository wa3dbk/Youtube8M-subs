00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:13.530
 I'm the one I'm telling you about the channel. 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.039
 world.de and today I will bring a video as well 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.390
 fast for you is is a synthesis that will be 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.449
 it's worth it or do not install windows 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:26.130
 phone 10 predicted windows mobile 10 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.510
 predicted or simply windows 10 as well 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.580
 in my first impressions video and 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.859
 I talked about what I found of the system 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.620
 so on my first impression 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:37.800
 looking at some functions 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.890
 had some change other is not little 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.940
 something there some some applications 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:48.629
 basic with giving one another not a thing 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.039
 if you keep an unstable others are not well 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.789
 by the way, do not you? 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.100
 It's something that has changed so I think 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.600
 It was kind of cool so the 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.910
 files changed 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.439
 the mobile phone's parent or the 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.430
 It was changed not into each even likes 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:07.979
 calculator has changed these 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.299
 basic applications of the little thing 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.799
 I even heard some comments talking 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:17.009
 on windows 7 with a version 8.2 of the 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:20.070
 Windows Phone 18.11 only yes I should 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.920
 agree that it's kind of like 18.2 plus lonely 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.939
 That's not right, and you had some changes. 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:32.040
 really differing comes from 8.1 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:33.509
 just that it's nothing so drastic and 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.430
 we must remember that this is a 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.450
 preview is still a first version of 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.810
 if he predicted 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.590
 or there is still a lot going on 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.610
 to change 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:47.009
 also remembering that the version of 512 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:52.619
 could have all the functions of the version of 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:55.829
 1 gig really is yes has some bugs 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.630
 that blue screen sounds like the 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.820
 Sometimes the phone stays a bit longer. 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.840
 nerd gives a lock between something and 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.210
 another only that is nothing so worrisome 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.759
 as I said in my biggest concern 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.310
 it was not being able to make a call only 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.680
 since before he left in douz 10 already 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.680
 I said that I would update a 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.329
 the device because not only because I 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.579
 I really wanted to see the version of windows 7 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:23.250
 How was I going to show you all what 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:25.950
 It would be the windows 10 to death I will 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.079
 decide whether or not it is worth installing 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.389
 windows phone 10 because I was testing 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:33.900
 other functions and it was also a lack of 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:36.689
 all the time with little time to record and 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.489
 well what I can tell you is if 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:41.189
 this is a preview 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:45.150
 and it's just for rehearsal I do not know 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:47.970
 preview is for people who create 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.900
 applications and want to go pro explore 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:54.780
 a windows 10 interface or not 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.900
 It's for ordinary eyes and it already leaves 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.419
 it clear that it would not be worth as good 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.909
 install to a cd that unless it is 

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:04.439
 'insider or really an enthusiast who 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:06.419
 It's my case I 'm not a creator of 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:09.469
 application or anything do not create games in 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:09.469
 nothing then I am an enthusiastic 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.099
 I wanted to know the 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:16.019
 new system this they have not changed here 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:20.129
 in my case nor in common applications 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:22.799
 which hurt what would have the mega scales 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:24.750
 time has not changed here I do not know if in function 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.479
 the size of my tels due to the 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.699
 My party is 512 because it seems that 

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:31.680
 there were other videos days they changed to 

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:35.340
 Long plate that was if I'm not mistaken. 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.349
 not the lumina 130 than a part which 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.840
 really showed many kalume bugs 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:43.319
 730 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:46.199
 It's what I did not see in the 630's. 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:48.269
 bugs even though I can say 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:50.879
 really for you 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.829
 worth installing on my 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:55.979
 opinion a car talking to you in 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:57.689
 My opinion is I do not think it's worth 

00:03:55.979 --> 00:04:01.169
 worth installing if you are a regular user 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:04.500
 if you only have this device yours 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:07.739
 uses day-to-day basic functions 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.079
 still there, I believe that 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:12.509
 it does not pay so much for you to install on 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:16.440
 wait for a new update 

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:18.329
 of windows 10 that is or wait 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.669
 completely destabilize a version 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.560
 end then yes you must install 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.810
 otherwise I believe it is not 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.150
 good you install windows 10 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.710
 it's my opinion 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.650
 unless you are an enthusiasm 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.600
 just like the kaka is very curious to 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.729
 to see windows is to install 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.830
 happens uninstall already has a 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:41.310
 application is that you can bring 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:44.699
 back windows 10 for windows function 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.620
 8.1 in case you are not many and watch 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:49.440
 one to be an application creator of 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.660
 'insider I do not see much advantage you 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.690
 change pro windows 10 at the moment as 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:58.919
 I said bugs and everything is not in Portuguese 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:01.680
 things like that so I do not see much 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:04.590
 Right now there are a lot of people going 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:08.699
 install will want to come back however 28.11 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:10.350
 will have but will have in common if 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:13.280
 despair settled and not okay 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.180
 getting back has got to come back yes 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.889
 but well 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.510
 It's my opinion I think at the moment 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:22.260
 It's not the time for everyone yet. 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:24.720
 install windows 10 on your device and 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:28.500
 I think you'd better wait. 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:33.180
 and install a full version 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:35.099
 and or maybe a version comes out there 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.110
 version best completed in a new 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:39.479
 update reminding you when you left 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.760
 An update I'll be bringing to 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:44.010
 Who are you? I hope so. 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.260
 You did not forget the video. 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:49.500
 to comment on the advice found likes 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.490
 social networks and well 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.919
 you already installed 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:55.110
 leave your comment and say what 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:57.690

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.610
 beauty and that was it 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.849
 Many thanks to everyone, sorry, delay. 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:06.440
 imposed on videos 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:06.440
 That was it, bye.
