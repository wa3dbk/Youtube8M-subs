00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
or that these characters will in fact

or that these characters will in fact
join<00:04:04.050> the<00:04:04.200> roster<00:04:04.350> it<00:04:04.739> may<00:04:05.010> sound<00:04:05.220> that<00:04:05.459> way

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
join the roster it may sound that way

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.280 
join the roster it may sound that way
but<00:04:05.640> for<00:04:06.030> the<00:04:06.090> time<00:04:06.270> being<00:04:06.330> it's<00:04:06.780> still<00:04:07.020> only<00:04:07.140> a

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
but for the time being it's still only a

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.410 
but for the time being it's still only a
rumor<00:04:07.680> and<00:04:07.860> since<00:04:08.220> this<00:04:08.400> rumor<00:04:08.790> is<00:04:08.820> so<00:04:09.209> vague

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
rumor and since this rumor is so vague

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.790 
rumor and since this rumor is so vague
it<00:04:09.720> could<00:04:09.959> be<00:04:10.050> a<00:04:10.080> little<00:04:10.260> difficult<00:04:10.530> to

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
it could be a little difficult to

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.110 
it could be a little difficult to
determine<00:04:11.160> whether<00:04:11.370> they<00:04:11.730> meant<00:04:11.970> these

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
determine whether they meant these

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.580 
determine whether they meant these
characters<00:04:12.600> to<00:04:12.720> be<00:04:12.810> a<00:04:12.840> part<00:04:13.140> of<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:13.380> main

characters to be a part of the main
roster<00:04:13.860> or<00:04:14.250> if<00:04:14.670> they<00:04:14.760> are<00:04:14.850> going<00:04:14.910> to<00:04:15.000> be

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
roster or if they are going to be

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.940 
roster or if they are going to be
post-launch<00:04:15.570> characters<00:04:16.200> or<00:04:16.590> if<00:04:16.680> it<00:04:16.770> would<00:04:16.859> be

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
post-launch characters or if it would be

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.949 
post-launch characters or if it would be
like<00:04:17.070> a<00:04:17.130> to<00:04:17.400> and<00:04:17.580> to<00:04:17.700> kind<00:04:17.940> of<00:04:18.060> deal<00:04:18.209> but<00:04:18.810> it

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
like a to and to kind of deal but it

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.330 
like a to and to kind of deal but it
kind<00:04:18.989> of<00:04:19.230> seemed<00:04:19.470> to<00:04:19.560> be<00:04:19.680> employing<00:04:20.040> that<00:04:20.220> they

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
kind of seemed to be employing that they

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.949 
kind of seemed to be employing that they
meant<00:04:20.549> part<00:04:20.850> of<00:04:20.940> the<00:04:21.000> main<00:04:21.180> roster<00:04:21.419> and<00:04:21.870> of

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
meant part of the main roster and of

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.600 
meant part of the main roster and of
course<00:04:22.140> you<00:04:22.260> can<00:04:22.380> argue<00:04:22.590> and<00:04:22.919> say<00:04:22.950> well<00:04:23.460> they

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
course you can argue and say well they

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.010 
course you can argue and say well they
probably<00:04:23.700> haven't<00:04:24.030> even<00:04:24.150> started<00:04:24.450> work<00:04:24.810> on

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
probably haven't even started work on

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.659 
probably haven't even started work on
post-launch<00:04:25.410> characters<00:04:25.919> yet<00:04:26.070> which<00:04:26.490> is<00:04:26.520> a

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
post-launch characters yet which is a

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:27.770 
post-launch characters yet which is a
good<00:04:26.820> point<00:04:27.000> but<00:04:27.210> yet<00:04:27.360> again

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
good point but yet again

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.300 
good point but yet again
it's<00:04:27.870> not<00:04:27.990> confirmed<00:04:28.350> and<00:04:28.650> it's<00:04:28.740> still<00:04:28.920> only<00:04:29.130> a

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
it's not confirmed and it's still only a

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.830 
it's not confirmed and it's still only a
rumor<00:04:29.670> at<00:04:29.790> the<00:04:29.880> moment<00:04:30.180> so<00:04:30.480> I<00:04:30.510> guess<00:04:30.720> we'll

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
rumor at the moment so I guess we'll

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:31.970 
rumor at the moment so I guess we'll
have<00:04:30.960> to<00:04:31.110> just<00:04:31.260> wait<00:04:31.350> and<00:04:31.650> see<00:04:31.680> what<00:04:31.950> happens

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
have to just wait and see what happens

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.560 
have to just wait and see what happens
but<00:04:32.520> let's<00:04:32.940> say<00:04:33.090> for<00:04:33.300> the<00:04:33.330> sake<00:04:33.510> of

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
but let's say for the sake of

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.360 
but let's say for the sake of
speculation<00:04:34.290> that<00:04:34.440> hypothetically<00:04:35.160> the

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
speculation that hypothetically the

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.460 
speculation that hypothetically the
rumor<00:04:35.639> about<00:04:35.760> Alex<00:04:36.240> urien<00:04:36.720> are<00:04:36.930> Mika<00:04:37.290> and

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
rumor about Alex urien are Mika and

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.409 
rumor about Alex urien are Mika and
Corinne<00:04:37.800> is<00:04:37.950> legitimate<00:04:38.669> and<00:04:38.700> one<00:04:39.150> hundred

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
Corinne is legitimate and one hundred

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:40.820 
Corinne is legitimate and one hundred
percent<00:04:39.450> accurate<00:04:40.080> that<00:04:40.350> would<00:04:40.560> mean<00:04:40.710> the

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
percent accurate that would mean the

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.230 
percent accurate that would mean the
core<00:04:41.040> roster<00:04:41.490> would<00:04:41.639> end<00:04:41.820> up<00:04:41.940> looking

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
core roster would end up looking

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.240 
core roster would end up looking
something<00:04:42.480> like<00:04:42.690> this<00:04:43.020> so<00:04:43.620> if<00:04:43.740> this<00:04:43.889> was

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
something like this so if this was

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.100 
something like this so if this was
indeed<00:04:44.610> the<00:04:44.669> core<00:04:44.970> roster<00:04:45.419> would<00:04:45.660> you<00:04:45.780> guys<00:04:45.900> be

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
indeed the core roster would you guys be

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.720 
indeed the core roster would you guys be
happy<00:04:46.410> about<00:04:46.500> it<00:04:46.770> would<00:04:46.950> you<00:04:47.040> guys<00:04:47.160> be<00:04:47.370> upset

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730 
happy about it would you guys be upset

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.820 
happy about it would you guys be upset
do<00:04:48.210> you<00:04:48.300> in<00:04:48.450> fact<00:04:48.510> think<00:04:48.990> this<00:04:49.139> rumor<00:04:49.440> is<00:04:49.590> true

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
it's partially true that maybe we could

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.620 
it's partially true that maybe we could
see<00:04:53.010> two<00:04:53.250> of<00:04:53.400> those<00:04:53.490> characters<00:04:54.090> but<00:04:54.240> not<00:04:54.419> all
