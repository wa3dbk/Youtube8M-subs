00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:54.599 
cold blooded is still dominant if

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:56.420 
cold blooded is still dominant if
everyone<00:04:55.020> ran<00:04:55.199> cold<00:04:55.470> blooded<00:04:55.710> kill<00:04:56.160> streaks

would<00:04:56.580> be<00:04:56.699> completely<00:04:57.180> useless<00:04:57.330> in<00:04:57.780> this<00:04:57.900> game

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
would be completely useless in this game

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.260 
would be completely useless in this game
they<00:04:58.259> people<00:04:58.470> calling<00:04:58.860> Harriers<00:04:59.310> pave<00:05:00.000> lows

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
they people calling Harriers pave lows

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.999 
they people calling Harriers pave lows
they<00:05:00.840> would<00:05:00.990> just<00:05:01.110> float<00:05:01.349> around<00:05:01.470> in<00:05:01.710> the<00:05:01.800> sky

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:02.009 
they would just float around in the sky

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:03.050 
they would just float around in the sky
and<00:05:02.190> they<00:05:02.280> wouldn't<00:05:02.490> do<00:05:02.550> jack<00:05:02.789> shit

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
and they wouldn't do jack shit

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.990 
and they wouldn't do jack shit
it<00:05:03.900> wouldn't<00:05:04.080> be<00:05:04.199> fun<00:05:04.409> at<00:05:04.620> all<00:05:04.800> so<00:05:05.280> stopping

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
it wouldn't be fun at all so stopping

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.899 
it wouldn't be fun at all so stopping
power<00:05:06.150> really<00:05:06.569> did<00:05:06.720> save<00:05:06.960> Mon<00:05:07.229> warfare<00:05:07.590> to<00:05:07.909> if

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:08.909 
power really did save Mon warfare to if

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:10.550 
power really did save Mon warfare to if
they<00:05:09.060> if<00:05:09.569> they<00:05:09.750> took<00:05:09.930> I<00:05:09.990> think<00:05:10.349> that's<00:05:10.470> why

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
they if they took I think that's why

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.350 
they if they took I think that's why
they<00:05:10.740> left<00:05:10.949> stopping<00:05:11.370> power<00:05:11.490> in<00:05:11.759> here<00:05:11.970> because

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
they left stopping power in here because

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.480 
they left stopping power in here because
they<00:05:12.659> pretty<00:05:12.870> much<00:05:12.990> knew<00:05:13.199> everyone<00:05:13.830> would<00:05:14.340> be

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
they pretty much knew everyone would be

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.100 
they pretty much knew everyone would be
running<00:05:14.729> around<00:05:14.880> with<00:05:15.090> ghost<00:05:15.419> I<00:05:15.720> mean<00:05:15.960> are
