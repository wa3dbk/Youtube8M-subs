00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.450
 so you see these weeks before the 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.669
 guest play at the table leader maybe 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.980
 even more tense concentrated 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:23.680
 more motivated than usual twelfth day of play 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.610
 the tsg goes to munich the fc bavaria 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.169
 a house number 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.239
 maybe even your own 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:30.460
 postal code for itself the currency 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:33.430
 anyway or just because of that 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:37.030
 everything is possible i just think if 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:41.080
 you so challenges completely clean 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.550
 then you just have to try 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.040
 the best possible from such a lot 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.200
 from sohren and I just hold nothing 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.940
 of which from the outset any games 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.050
 to dismiss or somehow think 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.170
 or is not possible 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.980
 why not the farmer munich too 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.270
 Home again and again definitely lose 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.880
 maybe it is already on this 22 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.690
 november so far who knows the home record 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.489
 the bavarian 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.320
 impressive the last eight 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.460
 won bundesliga games in munich 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.290
 Gate ratio 26 24 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.520
 I can also be you lose in 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.950
 Munich does not need to fool us 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.080
 if you drive to munich in munich 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:22.080
 and loses 4560 everything is normal 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:24.479
 or better as once rom so first 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.140
 no joke is so that simply there is 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.610
 a really great team is and 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.740
 today everyone expects that you 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.940
 That's why you can actually lose 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.159
 actually as a team do not lose much 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.920
 and at the same time much win almost 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.810
 already more than just the fcb points 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.539
 logically like to keep in munich 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.060
 want to be informed interested in 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:50.160
 opponents on hope heimer werdegang 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.420
 So I have to say a fantastic one 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:57.710
 development of the club sac he is considered 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.500
 trainer also the development of individual 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.970
 player kevin volland we have yesterday 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.610
 seen 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:08.729
 sebastian rudy fermino has for brazil 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.430
 met modeste in it 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.480
 the midfield is very well staffed 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.970
 highly interesting defender with 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.280
 niklas reins still very young 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.440
 player andy Beck over the side too 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.780
 all very interesting team 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.459
 it's the record champion again 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.610
 can make difficult as in the last 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.510
 season also in a draw 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.910
 Of course they are still light 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.310
 subject to fluctuations but we have to 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.579
 Take this team very seriously 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.220
 Last year, I think 3 3 played 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:40.700
 we have nothing to give the go 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.450
 only with a top performance top reputable 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.860
 attitude 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.470
 only then will we be the place again 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.530
 I would leave it under the line 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.060
 rather after the game speaks of 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.090
 opposing coach not in detail 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.190
 with me after the victory we have praised 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.790
 but rather after 3 3 in 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.010
 Munich 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.140
 and there is now a casual stop it 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.269
 I would rather four points on the 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.000
 nice chat abstain sounds 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:08.549
 a fair deal so there is hiding 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.620
 It's not what we want to do there 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.040
 will certainly not wait for the game 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.340
 his 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.069
 it may be that this start-up height as 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.580
 said something is deeper or completely 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.890
 ahead 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.510
 but how we want to attack then 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.670
 that we aggressively disturb the ball 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.239
 I prefer that my players organs 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.670
 so fast out 20 months for it 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.430
 have worked and now it was 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.069
 certainly not change 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.140
 why the concept is yes in the 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.540
 last time already worked up 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.940
 until today has a pep guardiola office time 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.739
 at the fcb never an opponent in one 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.620
 Bundesliga game more goal shots 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:51.829
 delivered as the bavaria itself except 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.829
 against the tsg in said 3 to 3
