00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:43.339
 all the things she likes she did 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.649
 a collection that reinforced his style 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:48.440
 showed her preferences as she 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.690
 always makes more than had things 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:55.010
 she had done everything with 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:57.620
 look more refined but very clear 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.149
 four or five very sharp inputs 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.299
 very differentiated 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:05.030
 the first with the comos brings them 

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:07.880
 transparency she made a tulle dress 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.729
 transparent with colored spots as if 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:14.270
 were hung on that one in that tulle 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:16.610
 transparent then had a gray series 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.190
 then had a series of prints and 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.190
 then had a contrast between the 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.360
 transparency and woolen fabric 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.750
 heavy 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.970
 was a very good renovated collection where 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:33.620
 she showed her style in a way 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:36.650
 fairly new second collection has been 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:39.230
 here in the pavilion of the villa park 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.210
 wolves and it was the alexandre's resolve 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:46.080
 a sophisticated collection 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:50.780
 are of great elegance where it shows 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:53.970
 a woman who dresses in a way 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.880
 very particular is a very 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.479
 particular with that strangeness of 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:04.259
 format he always puts on the look 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:07.110
 his fashion and it was a collection where he 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.270
 said he was inspired by flowers 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.790
 the flowers in that last moment before 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.130
 that the petals begin to fall then 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.690
 they also wore 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.400
 gave up 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.590
 I want to invest almost as if the part of 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.290
 top fall on the bottom 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:26.250
 started the sleeve fell to the back and 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.739
 This modified the silhouette of people. 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.500
 the silhouette of the woman because often 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.870
 that fall making volumes places that 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.110
 usually do not and at the same time 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.360
 had a sexy subtlety because 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.060
 had a piece of skin that appeared 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.780
 these flowers that wake you up this 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:48.540
 these vices that have a lot of fun 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:52.560
 sophisticated fabrics and a 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:55.350
 Series C dealt with the small beads 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.230
 since it has been entirely covered by 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.690
 beads a very elegant thing 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.230
 very sophisticated for very 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.230
 Special 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.660
 maria garcia made a collection 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.269
 let's say with many possibilities of 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.630
 I use you so much for a girl 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:18.120
 the younger the initial idea of ​​the 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:22.019
 brand as for a woman already a little 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.820
 the youngest, perhaps a client of 56 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.760
 years of the brand that has already 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.760
 grown because they said the dinho 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:33.730
 harder 60's with formatinho 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:37.239
 more structured dresses mill 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:40.000
 a cio hats that would be 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.709
 for a girl and at the same time 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.099
 some more sophisticated clothes 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:48.069
 olé was a collection is that it was not much 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:50.650
 clear to the largest client a clinic 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:52.720
 in an attempt to pick up a little 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.390
 behind a little bit further 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.379
 a younger woman a woman so less 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.780
 young 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:01.180
 she tried to do a little bit of each 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.370
 thing and lose a little bit and clarity of the 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:08.019
 that we imagined it was Maria 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:11.620
 Formerly Victorious time 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:14.470
 flame is a very young young stylist is 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.329
 who came from Bahia and presented his 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.049
 second collection of são paulo fashion 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.470
 week 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:23.220
 he did a concise job he used 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.660
 few fabrics did a modeling 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.630
 restricted that it has shown in several 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:31.150
 different fabrics opened very well to 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.580
 collection with a very beautiful beige o 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:37.840
 first entry was very pretty strong 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:40.780
 with the new shoulder umbra redon given and all 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:44.500
 this series b and then it was repeated in 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:46.510
 cite translates into other shades of a tone 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.789
 that he used enough made a 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.570
 testimonial made great on top of the 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:51.550
 silver 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.160
 unlike almost everyone who 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.169
 the gold of the other metals 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.700
 collections almost all were in the eye he 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:00.430
 it was strong on the plate 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.979
 but despite the small work job 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.750
 and show off a very well made outfit 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:07.300
 I think he can only now 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.430
 start loosening up a bit and getting a 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.430
 little of that scheme a little madame one 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.139
 little atelier he has done he has 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.990
 future is a boy 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:19.110
 It has a lot of talent and should loge in 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:23.289
 fashion 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:27.580
 the other collection was brand is pink né 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:29.110
 is a brand of party clothes and this 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.139
 time it had a rather 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:35.639
 different because he said to our 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:38.229
 The team that made girls clothes 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:39.789
 thinking with his head if he was 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:42.849
 a girl he would like to wear 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:45.279
 those dresses just and I do not know if it is 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:46.960
 exactly what girls will want 

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:49.629
 invest because I found adjustments a bit 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:54.009
 too many things had been based on 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:56.469
 asks for embroidery short met skirt pants 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:59.259
 I think the parties he's due to 

00:05:56.469 --> 00:06:01.360
 be very lively and very fun and 

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:05.099
 a little more fanciful than 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.099
 maybe girls like to dress 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:13.330
 last forum and that is presented a 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:16.569
 previous and beautiful collection but almost 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:18.430
 as if it were a summer sequence 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:20.409
 we can not even say that 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:23.979
 a winter collection because the fabrics 

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:28.960
 seem to have been presented in 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:33.879
 Typical summer colors like white 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:36.089
 coral was a collection a 

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:39.550
 collection that looked without really a 

00:06:36.089 --> 00:06:42.370
 summer sequence is with prints 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:44.379
 beautiful as they were in the summer and 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:47.349
 in that same toada of things 

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:49.839
 who are presenting and who 

00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:51.969
 and it works 

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:55.770
 I think if we have a place 

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:58.560
 a little heavier these fights go 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:01.259
 will contrast what will be seen in the 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:03.680
 more appropriate clothing store like 

00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:07.470
 station to change the station a little 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:09.750
 It was a beautiful collection of holy clothes that 

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:12.569
 It fell beautifully to have been beautiful prints. 

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:15.090
 very beautiful had a series of 

00:07:12.569 --> 00:07:17.400
 sampa saci paler with a species 

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:19.470
 of one of a rubberized plastic in 

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:22.289
 that gave an evening that gave a 

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:24.479
 pretty pretty clothes or very effect 

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:26.970
 short or long enough 

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:30.020
 contrast plus one more collection 

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:30.020
 suitable for summer
