what<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.199> really<00:00:25.230> want<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.619> do<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:25.920> use<00:00:26.400> the

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
what you really want to do is use the

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.700 
what you really want to do is use the
weight<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.939> use<00:00:27.180> your<00:00:27.349> acceleration<00:00:28.349> burst

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
weight to use your acceleration burst

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.230 
weight to use your acceleration burst
and<00:00:28.920> so<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.099> defender<00:00:29.460> gets<00:00:29.640> right<00:00:29.849> up<00:00:29.880> on<00:00:30.210> you

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
and so the defender gets right up on you

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.209 
and so the defender gets right up on you
then<00:00:31.050> hit<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.679> then<00:00:31.890> more<00:00:32.009> than<00:00:32.070> likely

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
then hit it and then more than likely

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.700 
then hit it and then more than likely
your<00:00:32.730> burst<00:00:33.059> away<00:00:33.329> from<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.690> leaving<00:00:34.410> him<00:00:34.559> and

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
your burst away from you leaving him and

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.080 
your burst away from you leaving him and
you're<00:00:34.860> just<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.399> you'll<00:00:35.610> get<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.820> lot<00:00:36.030> more
