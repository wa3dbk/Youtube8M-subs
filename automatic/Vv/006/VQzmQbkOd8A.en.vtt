right<00:02:23.129> here<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:24.000> this<00:02:24.390> is<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.569> popular

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
right here and this is a popular

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.720 
right here and this is a popular
charging<00:02:25.470> handle<00:02:25.769> and<00:02:25.890> with<00:02:26.250> this<00:02:26.489> you<00:02:26.610> can

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
charging handle and with this you can

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.449 
charging handle and with this you can
also<00:02:26.879> do<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.329> charge<00:02:28.049> like<00:02:28.290> that<00:02:28.500> as<00:02:28.680> well<00:02:28.709> but

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
also do the charge like that as well but

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.880 
also do the charge like that as well but
what<00:02:29.610> it<00:02:29.700> doesn't<00:02:29.939> have<00:02:30.120> is<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.900> large<00:02:31.200> t-handle

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
what it doesn't have is a large t-handle

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.470 
what it doesn't have is a large t-handle
extension<00:02:32.489> over<00:02:32.610> here<00:02:32.909> for<00:02:33.120> left<00:02:33.299> hand

operation for ambidextrous operation and
it<00:02:35.819> also<00:02:35.939> doesn't<00:02:36.299> have<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.510> release<00:02:36.720> button

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
it also doesn't have the release button

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.809 
it also doesn't have the release button
back<00:02:37.230> here<00:02:37.470> it's<00:02:37.860> really<00:02:38.129> designed<00:02:38.250> for<00:02:38.549> right

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
back here it's really designed for right

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.920 
back here it's really designed for right
hand<00:02:39.090> use<00:02:39.890> here<00:02:40.890> it<00:02:40.980> is<00:02:41.069> next<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:42.480> TAC<00:02:42.690> ops

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
hand use here it is next to the TAC ops

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.869 
hand use here it is next to the TAC ops
let's<00:02:43.709> see<00:02:43.860> if<00:02:43.950> I<00:02:44.010> can<00:02:44.129> get<00:02:44.250> them<00:02:44.340> side<00:02:44.489> by<00:02:44.519> side

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
let's see if I can get them side by side

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.210 
let's see if I can get them side by side
here<00:02:44.909> so<00:02:45.239> you<00:02:46.049> see<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.290> TAC<00:02:46.500> ops<00:02:46.739> is<00:02:46.980> quite<00:02:47.190> a

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
here so you see the TAC ops is quite a

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.649 
here so you see the TAC ops is quite a
bit<00:02:47.430> bigger<00:02:49.549> now<00:02:50.549> the<00:02:50.640> natural<00:02:50.879> question<00:02:51.480> is

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659 
bit bigger now the natural question is

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:53.210 
bit bigger now the natural question is
this<00:02:51.780> doesn't<00:02:52.019> think<00:02:52.290> snag<00:02:52.560> oh<00:02:52.709> and<00:02:52.829> gear<00:02:53.069> I

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
this doesn't think snag oh and gear I

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.250 
this doesn't think snag oh and gear I
haven't<00:02:53.579> found<00:02:53.790> that<00:02:53.879> it<00:02:54.060> does<00:02:54.329> but<00:02:54.900> of<00:02:55.049> course

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
haven't found that it does but of course

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.099 
haven't found that it does but of course
you<00:02:55.409> are<00:02:55.549> enlarging<00:02:56.549> that<00:02:56.579> t-handle<00:02:57.390> so<00:02:57.930> it

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
you are enlarging that t-handle so it

00:02:58.109 --> 00:02:59.630 
you are enlarging that t-handle so it
may<00:02:58.379> increase<00:02:58.799> the<00:02:59.069> chances<00:02:59.370> of<00:02:59.489> it<00:02:59.609> getting

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
may increase the chances of it getting

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.190 
may increase the chances of it getting
snagged<00:03:00.120> up<00:03:00.329> and<00:03:00.480> some<00:03:00.629> gear<00:03:00.780> that<00:03:00.930> you<00:03:01.019> may<00:03:01.139> be

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
snagged up and some gear that you may be

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.750 
snagged up and some gear that you may be
wearing<00:03:01.500> they'll<00:03:02.069> definitely<00:03:02.250> want<00:03:02.579> to<00:03:02.609> check

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
wearing they'll definitely want to check

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.520 
wearing they'll definitely want to check
to<00:03:02.909> make<00:03:03.000> sure<00:03:03.060> it's<00:03:03.269> not<00:03:03.389> snagging<00:03:03.930> I<00:03:04.079> haven't

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
to make sure it's not snagging I haven't

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:05.750 
to make sure it's not snagging I haven't
had<00:03:04.620> any<00:03:04.739> problems<00:03:05.129> with<00:03:05.190> it<00:03:05.430> but<00:03:05.549> I<00:03:05.609> don't

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
had any problems with it but I don't

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.759 
had any problems with it but I don't
give<00:03:05.970> up<00:03:06.120> all<00:03:06.239> that<00:03:06.389> often<00:03:06.659> but<00:03:07.319> I<00:03:07.349> have<00:03:07.500> tried

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
give up all that often but I have tried

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.110 
give up all that often but I have tried
it<00:03:07.889> with<00:03:07.980> different<00:03:08.159> vests<00:03:08.639> that<00:03:08.700> I<00:03:08.790> have<00:03:09.000> and

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
it with different vests that I have and

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.460 
it with different vests that I have and
I've<00:03:09.180> not<00:03:09.359> had<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:09.540> problem<00:03:09.780> with<00:03:09.959> snagging<00:03:10.379> in

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
I've not had a problem with snagging in

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.830 
I've not had a problem with snagging in
