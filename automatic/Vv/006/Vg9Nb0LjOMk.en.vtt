really<00:00:06.859> cool<00:00:07.040> nickname<00:00:07.460> or<00:00:07.670> I<00:00:07.700> could<00:00:07.939> just

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:07.970 
really cool nickname or I could just

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.370

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:09.380 
answer something silly and then

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.100 
answer something silly and then
eventually<00:00:09.650> it<00:00:10.130> just<00:00:10.580> became<00:00:10.880> bunny<00:00:11.299> and<00:00:11.540> if<00:00:11.780> I

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110

guess<00:01:28.689> I<00:01:28.930> guess<00:01:29.170> you<00:01:29.289> can<00:01:29.409> put<00:01:29.590> different

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
guess I guess you can put different

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.850 
guess I guess you can put different
topics<00:01:30.549> on<00:01:30.789> the<00:01:30.939> pizza<00:01:31.299> so<00:01:31.539> I<00:01:31.570> could<00:01:32.170> be<00:01:32.320> pretty

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
topics on the pizza so I could be pretty

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.929 
topics on the pizza so I could be pretty
different<00:01:33.100> right<00:01:33.630> Koreans<00:01:34.630> don't<00:01:34.960> really

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
different right Koreans don't really

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.059 
different right Koreans don't really
party<00:01:36.939> that<00:01:37.149> much<00:01:37.420> but<00:01:37.780> I<00:01:37.810> guess<00:01:38.049> a<00:01:38.079> few<00:01:38.380> Gaiden

00:01:39.059 --> 00:01:39.069 
party that much but I guess a few Gaiden

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:41.639 
party that much but I guess a few Gaiden
can<00:01:39.310> get<00:01:39.490> pretty<00:01:39.729> hyped<00:01:39.970> and<00:01:40.649> starless

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
can get pretty hyped and starless

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:43.289 
can get pretty hyped and starless
sometimes<00:01:42.100> there's<00:01:42.340> always<00:01:42.490> two<00:01:42.850> really<00:01:43.149> nice

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
sometimes there's always two really nice

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:45.270 
sometimes there's always two really nice
I<00:01:43.689> would<00:01:43.990> definitely<00:01:44.619> have<00:01:44.649> an<00:01:44.920> easier<00:01:45.219> time

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280

the<00:02:31.389> smartest<00:02:31.930> thing<00:02:32.200> would<00:02:32.410> be<00:02:32.590> to<00:02:32.859> take<00:02:32.889> like

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
the smartest thing would be to take like

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.640 
the smartest thing would be to take like
an<00:02:33.489> SCV<00:02:33.850> so<00:02:34.239> I<00:02:34.299> could<00:02:34.480> build<00:02:34.630> like<00:02:34.959> my<00:02:35.200> own<00:02:35.410> face

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
an SCV so I could build like my own face

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.229 
an SCV so I could build like my own face
on<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.040> island<00:02:36.430> I<00:02:36.579> could<00:02:36.790> build<00:02:37.000> my<00:02:37.090> own

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239

civilization<00:02:37.750> from<00:02:38.470> one<00:02:38.650> SUV<00:02:39.100> well<00:02:39.549> I<00:02:39.579> go

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
civilization from one SUV well I go

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.910 
civilization from one SUV well I go
jogging<00:02:40.480> from<00:02:40.930> time<00:02:41.139> to<00:02:41.319> time<00:02:41.350> so<00:02:41.709> there's

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
jogging from time to time so there's

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.620 
jogging from time to time so there's
still<00:02:42.100> that<00:02:42.340> but<00:02:42.609> apart<00:02:42.880> from<00:02:42.940> that<00:02:43.120> I<00:02:43.299> don't

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
still that but apart from that I don't

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.009 
still that but apart from that I don't
really<00:02:43.780> know<00:02:44.019> what<00:02:44.440> I<00:02:44.470> would<00:02:44.739> spend<00:02:44.950> my<00:02:45.130> time

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
really know what I would spend my time

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.900 
really know what I would spend my time
now<00:02:47.019> if<00:02:47.170> I<00:02:47.380> were<00:02:47.530> to<00:02:47.590> have<00:02:47.859> a<00:02:47.889> pet<00:02:48.190> myself<00:02:48.670> or
