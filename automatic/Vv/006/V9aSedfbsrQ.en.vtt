hi and welcome to kids guitar zone in
this<00:00:03.600> lesson<00:00:03.870> we're<00:00:04.350> going<00:00:04.500> to<00:00:04.560> learn<00:00:04.799> about

okay<00:00:17.250> so<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:18.119> chord<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:19.140> when<00:00:19.410> we<00:00:19.560> play<00:00:19.910> more

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
okay so a chord is when we play more

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.359 
okay so a chord is when we play more
than<00:00:21.119> one<00:00:21.180> string<00:00:21.810> more<00:00:22.470> than<00:00:22.680> one<00:00:22.859> note<00:00:23.130> at<00:00:23.279> a

than one string more than one note at a

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.509 
than one string more than one note at a
time<00:00:23.900> usually<00:00:24.900> we're<00:00:25.590> talking<00:00:25.980> about<00:00:26.099> playing

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519

okay so I'm actually playing five

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.650 
okay so I'm actually playing five
strings<00:00:42.990> at<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.230> same<00:00:43.320> time<00:00:46.250> all<00:00:47.250> right<00:00:47.660> let's

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
strings at the same time all right let's

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.870 
strings at the same time all right let's
get<00:00:48.780> started

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
get started

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.420

looking above you can see on the left
hand<00:00:53.700> side<00:00:54.140> there's<00:00:55.140> tablature<00:00:55.860> which<00:00:56.430> we've

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
hand side there's tablature which we've

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.380 
hand side there's tablature which we've
already<00:00:56.820> done

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
already done

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.350

and on the right hand side we've got

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.430 
and on the right hand side we've got
what's<00:01:00.810> called<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.320> chord<00:01:01.739> window<00:01:03.410> it<00:01:04.410> looks

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
what's called a chord window it looks

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.940 
what's called a chord window it looks
like<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.100> window<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.990> we<00:01:06.990> use<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.620> read

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
like a window and we use it to read

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.430 
like a window and we use it to read
chords<00:01:09.170> the<00:01:10.170> way<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.470> works<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:10.890> like<00:01:11.070> this<00:01:12.440> the

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
chords the way it works is like this the

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.770 
chords the way it works is like this the
lines<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:14.040> are<00:01:14.160> going<00:01:14.190> up<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.970> down<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.660> the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
lines that are going up and down in the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.420 
lines that are going up and down in the
chord<00:01:16.080> window<00:01:16.520> these<00:01:17.520> are<00:01:17.580> strings<00:01:19.280> the<00:01:20.280> one

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
chord window these are strings the one

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.480 
chord window these are strings the one
on<00:01:20.550> the<00:01:20.610> left<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:22.080> sixth<00:01:22.500> string<00:01:22.770> this

the right hand side the lines going

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:50.770 
the right hand side the lines going
across<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:47.550> chord<00:01:47.819> window<00:01:48.380> are<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:50.069> frets

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
across the chord window are the frets

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.650 
across the chord window are the frets
we've<00:01:51.780> got<00:01:51.929> the<00:01:52.050> first<00:01:52.350> fret<00:01:53.479> second<00:01:54.479> fret

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
see the thick black line this is zero or

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.330 
see the thick black line this is zero or
the<00:02:04.039> nut

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.520 

okay<00:02:08.340> let's<00:02:08.670> learn<00:02:08.910> how<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.179> play<00:02:09.450> an<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.929> chord

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.230 

if<00:02:13.530> you<00:02:13.709> look<00:02:13.860> at<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.010> chord<00:02:14.280> window<00:02:14.670> now<00:02:14.880> you

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
if you look at the chord window now you

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.390 
if you look at the chord window now you
can<00:02:15.390> see<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:15.720> numbers<00:02:16.050> one<00:02:16.520> two<00:02:17.520> and<00:02:17.690> three

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
can see the numbers one two and three

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.590 
can see the numbers one two and three
written<00:02:20.400> on<00:02:20.580> some<00:02:20.819> of<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.090> strings

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.580 

this<00:02:24.600> means<00:02:24.959> your<00:02:25.319> first<00:02:26.069> finger<00:02:27.590> second

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
this means your first finger second

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.320 
this means your first finger second
finger<00:02:28.770> and<00:02:29.569> third<00:02:30.569> finger

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.510 

so<00:02:35.330> you<00:02:36.020> can<00:02:36.170> see<00:02:36.380> the<00:02:36.560> one<00:02:37.390> is<00:02:38.390> on<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:39.520> second

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:48.730 
so you can see the one is on the second
fret<00:02:41.740> fourth<00:02:42.740> string<00:02:44.710> the<00:02:45.710> two<00:02:47.200> is<00:02:48.200> on<00:02:48.560> the
