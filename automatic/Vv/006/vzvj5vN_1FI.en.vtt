to<00:01:33.810> do<00:01:33.930> shading<00:01:34.170> I'm<00:01:34.410> gonna<00:01:34.590> use<00:01:34.800> a<00:01:34.830> paintbrush

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
to do shading I'm gonna use a paintbrush

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.670 
to do shading I'm gonna use a paintbrush
you<00:01:36.060> could<00:01:36.210> use<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.390> q-tip<00:01:36.750> if<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.290> want

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
you could use a q-tip if you want

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.440 
you could use a q-tip if you want
although<00:01:37.920> that'll<00:01:38.220> probably<00:01:38.430> be<00:01:38.760> slow

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
although that'll probably be slow

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.720 
although that'll probably be slow
because<00:01:40.080> the<00:01:40.260> body<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.740> huge<00:01:41.160> compared<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.670> the

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:41.730 
because the body is huge compared to the

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.550 
because the body is huge compared to the
head<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.180> could<00:01:42.600> use<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.750> paper<00:01:42.990> towel<00:01:43.380> I

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
head you could use a paper towel I

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.280 
head you could use a paper towel I
didn't<00:01:43.830> list<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.670> but<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.450> can<00:01:45.600> use<00:01:46.020> that

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
didn't list that but you can use that

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.370 
didn't list that but you can use that
and<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.980> will<00:01:47.190> work<00:01:47.340> somewhat<00:01:47.930> the<00:01:48.930> process

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
and that will work somewhat the process

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.870 
and that will work somewhat the process
that<00:01:49.560> you're<00:01:49.680> seeing<00:01:49.920> me<00:01:50.040> do<00:01:50.190> right<00:01:50.430> now<00:01:50.640> with

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
graphite stick that is just a really

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.950 
graphite stick that is just a really
really<00:02:10.770> big<00:02:11.160> pencil<00:02:11.570> that's<00:02:12.570> what's<00:02:12.810> on<00:02:12.930> the

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
really big pencil that's what's on the

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.650 
really big pencil that's what's on the
inside<00:02:13.200> of<00:02:13.590> pencils<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:14.880> know<00:02:14.970> basically

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
inside of pencils and you know basically

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.200 
inside of pencils and you know basically
I<00:02:15.690> would<00:02:15.810> drive<00:02:16.080> myself<00:02:16.590> crazy<00:02:16.830> if<00:02:17.190> I<00:02:17.790> used<00:02:18.030> a

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
I would drive myself crazy if I used a

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.210 
I would drive myself crazy if I used a
tiny<00:02:18.630> tip<00:02:18.870> pencil<00:02:19.320> to<00:02:19.470> fill<00:02:19.500> in<00:02:19.800> all<00:02:19.950> of<00:02:19.980> this

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
tiny tip pencil to fill in all of this

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.250 
tiny tip pencil to fill in all of this
space<00:02:20.820> and<00:02:21.090> I<00:02:22.080> never<00:02:22.530> really<00:02:22.860> liked<00:02:23.070> charcoal

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
space and I never really liked charcoal

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.810 
space and I never really liked charcoal
you<00:02:25.260> know<00:02:25.350> this<00:02:25.530> is<00:02:25.680> much<00:02:25.920> well<00:02:26.340> this<00:02:26.670> is

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
you know this is much well this is

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.520 
you know this is much well this is
pencil<00:02:27.210> like<00:02:27.360> because<00:02:27.690> it<00:02:27.810> is<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:28.140> pencil

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
pencil like because it is a pencil

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.980 
pencil like because it is a pencil
technically<00:02:29.430> I<00:02:30.270> was<00:02:30.510> saying<00:02:30.720> it's<00:02:30.840> more

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
technically I was saying it's more

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.990 
technically I was saying it's more
pencil<00:02:31.410> like<00:02:31.560> than<00:02:31.770> charcoal<00:02:32.220> but<00:02:32.490> it's

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
pencil like than charcoal but it's

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.230 
pencil like than charcoal but it's
exactly<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:33.810> pencil<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.760> I'm<00:02:35.760> basically

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
exactly a pencil and I'm basically

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.780 
exactly a pencil and I'm basically
filling<00:02:36.390> in<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.840> area<00:02:37.170> going<00:02:37.680> over<00:02:38.489> it<00:02:38.580> with<00:02:38.640> a

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
filling in the area going over it with a

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.630 
filling in the area going over it with a
bigger<00:02:39.060> brush<00:02:39.300> and<00:02:39.800> it's<00:02:40.800> such<00:02:41.010> a<00:02:41.040> dark<00:02:41.400> area

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
bigger brush and it's such a dark area

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.580 
bigger brush and it's such a dark area
it<00:02:41.880> really<00:02:41.910> didn't<00:02:42.450> need<00:02:42.570> highlights<00:02:43.410> and

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
it really didn't need highlights and

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.979 
it really didn't need highlights and
shadows<00:02:43.620> so<00:02:44.340> I<00:02:44.370> didn't<00:02:44.790> repeat<00:02:45.570> that<00:02:45.750> process

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
shadows so I didn't repeat that process

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.949 
shadows so I didn't repeat that process
but<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.370> same<00:02:47.550> thing<00:02:47.790> that<00:02:47.910> you<00:02:48.030> saw<00:02:48.300> for<00:02:48.840> the

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
but the same thing that you saw for the

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.500 
but the same thing that you saw for the
neck<00:02:49.170> I'm<00:02:49.380> doing<00:02:49.739> on<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:49.980> arm<00:02:50.160> now<00:02:50.450> there's<00:02:51.450> a

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
neck I'm doing on the arm now there's a

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.810 
neck I'm doing on the arm now there's a
differentiation<00:02:52.380> in<00:02:52.530> tone<00:02:52.800> from<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.610> top

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
differentiation in tone from the top

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.930 
differentiation in tone from the top
part<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.480> bottom<00:02:54.780> part<00:02:55.020> and<00:02:55.610> I'm<00:02:56.610> trying

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
part to the bottom part and I'm trying

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.150
