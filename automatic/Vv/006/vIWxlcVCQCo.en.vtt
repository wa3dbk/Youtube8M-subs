00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.740
 important to have well- groomed skin 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.660
 that's why we're going to use the 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.000
 Dry oil ermine day for 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.220

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.500
 little quantity we have enough what 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.040
 We distribute well by massaging the port of 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.040
 face 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.930
 and then we apply our cream 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.570
 moisturizing 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.730
 and remember we always apply the oil or 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.590
 the serum before the cream 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.480
 and now we are going to start with the 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.250
 make-up we will use a base of 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.200
 makeup of the same tone as our 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.720
 skin and we will apply it with a brush with 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.390
 a sponge now let's use a 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.610
 clear fluid corrector very light and 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.870
 we draw a vertical line of the 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.870
 in front of the chin 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.850
 we google our forehead 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:05.059
 and we draw half moon in the area of 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.790
 dark circles and power we apply the amount 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.380
 just without overloading the skin and we do 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.380
 the same on the other side 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.490
 we make the half moon and we distribute well 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.490
 all the product 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.040
 finally we clarified the area of ​​just 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:26.370
 under the eyebrow 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.560
 and on top of the upper lip and with the 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.990
 fingertip or a sponge and a 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.930
 little patience we are distributing 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.120
 well all the product 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.880

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.990
 unify the eyelid a brown shadow to 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.990
 eyelashes 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:48.039
 a little mask the just sunscreen 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.039
 below the cheekbone 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.060
 and on top of the tile drawing a faith 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:01.229
 a little bit of rouge in the center 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.229
 lips well marked eyebrows 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.500
 and we can use a corrector 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.899
 make-up foundation a bit lighter or 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.700
 the illuminator is very easy but you have 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.120
 be careful not to overload the 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.310
 skin you take a simple pigtail you give 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.680
 shape the fringe with the tongs and 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.540
 ready we have marked more the lips 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.580
