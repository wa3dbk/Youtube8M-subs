and then as DC in at the bottom which

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.379 
and then as DC in at the bottom which
could<00:01:27.859> potentially<00:01:28.009> go<00:01:28.520> into<00:01:28.789> a<00:01:28.850> very<00:01:29.029> simple

00:01:29.379 --> 00:01:29.389 
could potentially go into a very simple

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:32.319 
could potentially go into a very simple

docking cradle that feeling for thinking
about<00:01:32.539> here<00:01:32.840> so<00:01:33.469> its<00:01:33.590> rounds<00:01:34.100> six<00:01:34.579> to<00:01:34.729> seven

00:01:35.019 --> 00:01:35.029 
about here so its rounds six to seven

multi-touch<00:01:42.139> and<00:01:42.729> that<00:01:43.729> would<00:01:43.849> depend<00:01:43.999> on<00:01:44.450> the

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
multi-touch and that would depend on the

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.709 
multi-touch and that would depend on the

final software and device driver build

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:51.309 
final software and device driver build
on<00:01:48.529> the<00:01:48.709> back<00:01:48.829> there<00:01:49.069> no<00:01:49.420> accessible<00:01:50.420> battery

00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:51.319 
on the back there no accessible battery

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:53.769 
on the back there no accessible battery
but<00:01:51.590> there's<00:01:51.740> a<00:01:51.799> camera<00:01:52.249> a<00:01:52.429> couple<00:01:53.419> of<00:01:53.479> speaker

00:01:53.769 --> 00:01:53.779 
but there's a camera a couple of speaker

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:56.399 
but there's a camera a couple of speaker
ports<00:01:54.200> and<00:01:54.499> this<00:01:54.649> has<00:01:54.770> about<00:01:54.979> a<00:01:55.189> 30<00:01:55.669> watt<00:01:56.090> hour

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
ports and this has about a 30 watt hour

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.679 
ports and this has about a 30 watt hour
so<00:01:57.409> right<00:01:57.499> now<00:01:57.529> I<00:01:57.679> think<00:01:57.889> of<00:01:58.039> 20<00:01:58.729> we<00:01:59.299> sit<00:01:59.509> talk

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
so right now I think of 20 we sit talk

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:02.019 
so right now I think of 20 we sit talk
about<00:01:59.840> 25<00:02:00.319> or<00:02:00.349> our<00:02:00.759> battery<00:02:01.759> so<00:02:01.909> you're

00:02:02.019 --> 00:02:02.029 
about 25 or our battery so you're

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:04.959 
about 25 or our battery so you're
looking<00:02:02.119> at<00:02:02.419> 10<00:02:03.319> hours<00:02:03.619> battery<00:02:04.219> life<00:02:04.399> on<00:02:04.789> this

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:04.969 
looking at 10 hours battery life on this

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:09.460 
looking at 10 hours battery life on this
with<00:02:05.779> Android<00:02:06.289> it's<00:02:06.950> got<00:02:07.189> that<00:02:08.140> Samsung<00:02:09.140> 1

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
with Android it's got that Samsung 1

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.880 
with Android it's got that Samsung 1

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
a cortex a8 most processor in it so

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.380 
a cortex a8 most processor in it so
actually<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.310> performance<00:02:16.940> should<00:02:17.090> be<00:02:17.360> a

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
actually the performance should be a

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.610 
actually the performance should be a

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
which is a nice game racing game on the

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.589 
which is a nice game racing game on the
on<00:02:31.000> the<00:02:31.060> Android<00:02:31.450> platform<00:02:31.480> so<00:02:32.080> let's<00:02:33.330> go<00:02:34.330> into

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
on the Android platform so let's go into

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:39.960 
on the Android platform so let's go into
this<00:02:34.750> somewhere<00:02:35.349> and<00:02:36.340> they've<00:02:37.030> got<00:02:38.970> g-sensor

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
this somewhere and they've got g-sensor

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.460 
this somewhere and they've got g-sensor
enabled<00:02:40.480> on<00:02:40.540> this<00:02:40.720> as<00:02:40.870> well<00:02:41.019> so<00:02:41.200> let's<00:02:41.319> have<00:02:41.409> a

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
enabled on this as well so let's have a

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.680 
enabled on this as well so let's have a
little<00:02:41.650> quick<00:02:42.190> look<00:02:42.549> at<00:02:42.670> this<00:02:42.819> oh<00:02:45.030> I<00:02:46.030> just<00:02:46.150> H

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
little quick look at this oh I just H

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.280 
little quick look at this oh I just H
enable<00:02:47.379> the<00:02:47.470> g<00:02:47.620> sensor<00:02:48.420> ok<00:02:49.420> here<00:02:49.629> we<00:02:49.659> go<00:02:49.750> the

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
enable the g sensor ok here we go the

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.589 
enable the g sensor ok here we go the
chief<00:02:50.560> sensors<00:02:50.950> have<00:02:51.010> enabled<00:02:51.250> and<00:02:52.180> this<00:02:52.420> is<00:02:52.569> a

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
chief sensors have enabled and this is a

00:02:52.599 --> 00:03:07.720 
chief sensors have enabled and this is a
really<00:02:53.019> cool<00:02:53.230> experience

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730

so<00:03:08.730> I<00:03:08.760> very<00:03:09.030> quickly<00:03:09.150> one<00:03:09.480> more<00:03:09.629> little<00:03:09.719> demo

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
so I very quickly one more little demo

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.640 
so I very quickly one more little demo

with you have the backlight evenly
undercut<00:03:22.260> applications<00:03:23.090> war<00:03:24.090> yeah<00:03:24.569> it's

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
undercut applications war yeah it's

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.089 
undercut applications war yeah it's
working<00:03:25.049> as<00:03:25.379> well<00:03:25.590> and<00:03:27.500> there<00:03:28.500> you<00:03:28.620> go<00:03:28.680> there's

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
working as well and there you go there's

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.879 
working as well and there you go there's
a<00:03:29.219> little<00:03:29.370> of<00:03:29.639> the<00:03:29.849> auto<00:03:30.750> rotation<00:03:31.319> so<00:03:31.739> that's

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
a little of the auto rotation so that's

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:39.470 
a little of the auto rotation so that's
included<00:03:37.519> so<00:03:38.519> I<00:03:38.579> was<00:03:38.669> pointing<00:03:38.909> to<00:03:39.000> live<00:03:39.150> about

there's<00:03:49.349> not<00:03:49.500> on<00:03:49.709> this<00:03:49.980> build<00:03:50.760> at<00:03:50.909> the<00:03:51.000> moment

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389 
there's not on this build at the moment

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:53.209 
there's not on this build at the moment
but<00:03:51.510> who<00:03:51.989> say<00:03:52.290> they<00:03:52.409> are<00:03:52.590> working<00:03:52.620> with<00:03:53.069> Google

but who say they are working with Google

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:56.360 
but who say they are working with Google
on<00:03:53.579> that<00:03:53.760> so<00:03:53.969> there's<00:03:54.090> potential<00:03:54.989> for<00:03:55.500> this<00:03:56.129> to

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
on that so there's potential for this to

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.080 
on that so there's potential for this to
be<00:03:57.530> coming<00:03:58.530> with<00:03:58.650> the<00:03:58.919> android<00:03:59.699> marketplace

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
could be interesting so we'll have to

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:54.110 
could be interesting so we'll have to
look<00:04:51.509> to<00:04:51.780> the<00:04:51.949> q4<00:04:52.949> timeframe<00:04:53.520> to<00:04:53.699> see<00:04:53.820> this<00:04:53.940> in
