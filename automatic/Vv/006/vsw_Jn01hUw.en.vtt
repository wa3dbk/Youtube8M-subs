00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:11.250
 or, of course, parents, as well, I 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.030
 I donâ€™t know at the time it was very 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:19.100
 normal for a child to something 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:22.619
 was engaged in developed healthy beautiful 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:25.560
 here but beyond that there was 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.689
 what class did we play hockey 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.969
 first hockey then swimming 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:36.690
 parents have been fully engaged since childhood 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:39.660
 2008, for me, it became such 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.200
 you can say defining because i 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.230
 just crossed and seniors crossed 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.670
 in the main part 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.129
 broke in can say there became a leader 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.440
 and it turned out that 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.649
 I even knocked out many of the older guys and 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.289
 drove 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:00.149
 delivered for his country personal 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.170
 program 200 myth of freestyle 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.840
 personally, a little bit failed peking 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.740
 but then we managed to take the silver one 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:14.159
 Olympic award here and as if from this 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.230
 on the sly everything went rolling every 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.720
 year he was somehow so 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.930
 something was new especially all by 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.310
 starting one that is the opening of the new 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.440
 emotions new impressions 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:30.840
 new countries old rivals the most 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.680
 memorable after all I consider it for myself 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.020
 first olympic awards 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.840
 Olympic silver and movies because 16 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.760
 years to become a medalist but not 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.740
 everyone can boast of it especially 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.540
 in our form 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.400
 I think the fun will be on 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.890
 Universiade because for me first 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:54.840
 universiade this and this in principle 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.480
 Student Olympiad for this I think 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.670
 will be much more interesting because 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.440
 will not only age but will be on 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.880
 in fact all young athletes are 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:08.730
 will promote youth sports 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.440
 many countries really want to go and me 

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:14.610
 In Russia, the more so grand 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:18.030
 I think many serious events 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:21.350
 athletes will want to perform exactly 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:24.980
 In Russia, the greatest counting athlete 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:28.430
 who showed by his example that 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.590
 you can achieve everything you want and 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.050
 the main thing was to target me 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.300
 of course we have a very simple two 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.910
 workout a day almost every day 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.120
 here and after training naturally or 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.300
 are you resting 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:48.450
 most often it is a dream in your free time 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:51.330
 say the weekend we get either 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.600
 like all normal people, movies are very 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:58.130
 love to play pool with friends just 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:01.920
 wake up a very warm season summer 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:04.080
 we will just walk along the street calmly 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.170
 rest enjoy the main competitor 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:11.910
 a lot of them is primarily America 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:14.280
 china france australia all countries and 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.880
 you can't just throw someone away 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.650
 what should i 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.350
 student Olympiad at all 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.810
 Olympiad happens such that appear 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:28.470
 dark horses and shoot catchers 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:33.079
 most beautiful because it's all the same 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:37.950
 spectacularly and above all, I think that 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:39.000
 the water is so well then that is so graceful 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.519
 nice element 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.540
 but we have a lot of complexes 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:49.140
 openwork hall as I train in 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:52.200
 Volgograd, that is, we have everything created for 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.690
 order to develop those muscles 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.209
 which we row is the main muscles 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.090
 backs of arms that is everything should be 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:03.930
 strongly tightened start to hang 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:07.140
 there is a girl who met me 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.890
 I met her I do not know 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.450
 came here to cheer for me 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:15.810
 I just need to support myself 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:18.690
 I think that it happened to me that 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:22.350
 parents helped a lot in this and 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:26.419
 I think swimming to show what I do 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:29.729
 live what i like doing here 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:32.970
 talent plays of course not unimportant 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:36.180
 role but of you will not have hard work by 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:38.520
 perseverance you can just burn your own 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:42.300
 talents end up being talented at 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:45.740
 having achieved nothing that's why here 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:48.419
 I need everything in moderation. I think that 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.380
 so that the people who are near you are 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:53.570
 support 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.570
 when there is support it will work out
