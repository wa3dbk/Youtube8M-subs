00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 hello guys how are you welcome to a 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.370
 new video and good I bring you the 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.730
 best tweets of the month of May 2014 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.139
 for your iphone ipod and ipad are the clicks 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.969
 very good that came out this same 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.910
 so let's start with the video 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.560
 let's start with boxee 2 is a tweet 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.420
 that will allow us to accommodate the 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.410
 icons attached or any other 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.420
 way that we will be looking at 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.369
 continuation itself this is the first 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.170
 form that does not have another default 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.119
 accuracy that I like the most this tweet is 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.529
 is like the separate icons to 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.269
 thanks to see more spaces of the 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.520
 device and this is the second most 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.140
 I like the tweet and sliding the finger 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.969
 up depends on each icon 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.640
 we can check all the configurations 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.960
 that we have provisions here for 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.219
 example I'm going to choose a position 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.559
 I like it a lot 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.719
 we give in ok and automatically we are 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.309
 accommodate the simple icons first like 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.320
 they could see this one that has enough 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.420
 animations and all the animations are 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.010
 pretty good and I like it a lot and good 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.090
 this title can find the group of 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.180
 drawings with the price of two dollars 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.040
 our strong box and 2 and in second 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.690
 place we have aesthetics called isidro 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.640
 how can you see what is going to 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.979
 allow to expose our control center 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.330
 in our doctor separate lines and 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.520
 can see the brightness of another 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.470
 side of the music producer and another side 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.479
 the widget buttons that the truth is 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.520
 looks pretty good and does not get in the way 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.470
 the ipad has very small functions 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.150
 but the truth is pretty good and 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.950
 well then let's go with the 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.840
 small configurations the only 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.760
 options that this tweet has is for 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.590
 disable it or activate it 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.840
 or do the student after the change 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.240
 good friends this one explain is with a 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.880
 dollar in criminal allep and well this 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.399
 it was sisi 2 and in third place we have 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.810
 this click called minimal camera is going 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:40.640
 to allow if we have our finger 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.649
 pressed disappear the two lines the 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.840
 superior and inferior and going back to 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.310
 press appear again to make the 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.470
 spaces to the camera application 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.789
 when the bars are hidden we are going to 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.710
 be able to take any photo from 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.910
 any part of the screen can 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.860
 see that I'm already taking it from the 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.180
 medium and it takes them pretty well 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.280
 these are the functions of the click 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.260
 minimal camera the functions that come 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.820
 against this trick they are very null 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.920
 all of you can be of much use already 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.450
 sometimes these two bars hinder the 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.070
 tweet that is completely free in the 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.110
 what power and games and good friends this 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.120
 it was minimal camera these were the 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.100
 best tweets of the month of May 2014 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.420
 they can not that if these tweets 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.040
 they liked and they were of no help 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.330
 forget to give like they increase and 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.390

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.860
