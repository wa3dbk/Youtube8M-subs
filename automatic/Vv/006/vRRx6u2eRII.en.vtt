00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:08.350
 new project we will try to do 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.540
 a little recycled 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:15.400
 what are we going to need for this job 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:18.360
 this work is going to be to put can 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.360
 be buttons 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:26.270
 little eyes and here is going to go a flower here 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:29.329
 is going to go a flower this is unfinished 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.310
 still more or less I'm going to give you the 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:34.910
 is the list of what we are going to need 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:38.870
 what are we going to need 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:41.270
 the ecological canvas or any canvas 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.380
 cotton that you like 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:49.500
 to hunger 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:52.200
 a wire that is malleable but that is 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.530
 a little thick thing that when 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:01:01.790
 stick up here the flower does not bend 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.790
 a lot we're going to need acrylic paint 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.159
 in our t the polyamide to make the 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:09.100
 little face 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:11.789
 we will also need to cause 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:16.120
 Spanish itself can also be polar 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:20.110
 to make the views every day 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:22.530
 of our work we are going to need 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.850
 eva rubber 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:30.450
 come on and what are we going to use to recycle 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:32.850
 I'm always here to deodorants 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.640
 which the caps always 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.080
 I find a use in this case is the 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.850
 we will use to do this 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:43.380
 basket if you try not to throw anything 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.280
 recycle so we also save 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.820
 our planet 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:52.930
 as the channel told them some caps 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:57.790
 As you can see, they are deep deep and deep 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:02:00.549
 and quite useful for storing something 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.659
 here it's good, we're also going to 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:08.729
 need the gun with the silicone 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.729
 let's throw the gun to this one 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:16.640
 gastÃ³n we are also going to need a 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:21.380
 carton huesito 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:24.680
 and we're going to need more caps and 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.690
 soda caps and here I had two that 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.810
 they were already yellow and these two the 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:34.290
 paint so that suits them 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.340
 good that we are going to need 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.340
 we are going to need 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:45.400
 As I was saying let's grab the cap 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:49.030
 that would be this here I have colors 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:53.499
 use them all and what are we going to do 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:57.159
 we are going to put glue on it and like the 

00:02:53.499 --> 00:02:59.980
 ecological canvas does not fray if so 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:03.849
 which is easy to work then I grabbed 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:07.810
 thread was supporting the canvas and I went 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:11.200
 I am sticking around if I left some 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.940
 margin down to turn it around and paste it 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.620
 down also 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:20.400
 and that I did with 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:25.739
 all the caps here use 6 caps 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:28.290
 of six tapas and six tapas I made a flower 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.510
 it's like a flower the center 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.840
 sorry seven stages because there is the 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.909
 center of the center is higher and are 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.750
 the others that go around give a 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:43.760
 flower shape come 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:45.950
 with the cardboard support and I made this mold in 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.050
 flower shape does not just support the 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:53.600
 I put them on the wall and I passed them 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:57.590
 around if the pencil to mark the 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:04:01.600
 mold I cut it into cardboard and painted it 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:05.800
 would this be for you to do support 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:09.340
 well then I was hitting the uvi first 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:11.380
 to raise the middle one so the 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.210
 source as you see another color 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.760
 I made it brown to the others of color 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.569
 green 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.569
 this 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:23.680
 I put it in the middle of the middle fight and 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:27.550
 around hit the smaller ones now 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:30.030
 let's see how we also do this 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:35.130
 with the wire that I made grip 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.130
 suppose something thicker than this 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:42.860
 and I started to thread the wire around 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.390
 if I started screwing the wire and I gave it 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.880
 this form 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:49.040
 you see the stop they want 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.950
 they want the flower to remain in this case 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:55.190
 I did not want it too high so this 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:05:00.290
 first screw up do not be leave a little 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:02.480
 from page up screw and paste it 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:08.530
 it looks good very well I do not think it's going 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:08.530
 very well but they stick it to the bottom of this one 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:15.110
 the central part of the flower and good 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:19.690
 it is very firm there 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:22.910
 and we have our stem ready 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:25.440
 to stick the flower we are going to make 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:28.890
 right away 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:31.830
 what else are we going to need and I'm going to 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:34.380
 show here how we ended up going to 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:38.150
 need as I told them the caps as well 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:41.520
 I already have them ready, we are going to cut 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:43.660
 petals and here I made them in the shape of 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:47.550
 heart 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:49.930
 we are going to need 5 petals 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:53.560
 what would these be 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:57.669
 I made the fill cut this side of 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:59.560
 the double coz and I left a small one 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:04.460
 small opening as we come to 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:08.240
 do it in other jobs and fill it 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:13.120
 that is soft not hard well armed 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:16.009
 but not this hard stone yes but 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:19.880
 soft to the touch but well- filled 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:21.650
 good here then we are going to have the 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.889
 petals 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:27.880
 we are going to have them located, we are going to 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:27.880
 go placing forgiveness 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:33.940
 with this form 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.940
 come 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:42.119
 then we put them there 

00:06:38.249 --> 00:06:44.120
 It has the shape of a flower is having 

00:06:42.119 --> 00:06:48.410
 the shape 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:51.260
 let's make the face look like 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:53.190
 see there is a difference has the eyes 

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.290
 painted 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:07:00.180
 what are we going to need to do this 

00:06:55.290 --> 00:07:03.510
 face a circle of 9 centimeters 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:05.580
 we're going to fill in and we're going to do our 

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:09.060
 zero point back as we come 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:12.750
 doing the zero point back and we're going to 

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:15.020
 make the traditional face that is this 

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:17.880
 you already know it for the one who does not know 

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:20.910
 that go the tutorial number 1 that is the 

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:23.640
 portal chops and there you will see the step 

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:27.330
 This step is the traditional face that 

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:30.360
 it would be this they do not carry aristy almost like 

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:33.510
 can see in this doll does not wear 

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:34.860
 nose so the traditional face swims 

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:39.360
 plus 

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:41.759
 then we put the little mouth together 

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:45.539
 common traditional face and what are we going to 

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:48.990
 do let's paint the eyes you 

00:07:45.539 --> 00:07:52.289
 they make it the way they like in this 

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:54.160
 case I made them inclined in the shape of 

00:07:52.289 --> 00:07:57.729
 drop 

00:07:54.160 --> 00:08:01.620
 which gives it a pretty tender appearance 

00:07:57.729 --> 00:08:01.620
 I also paint the cheeks
