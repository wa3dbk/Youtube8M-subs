out<00:01:37.470> nicely<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.610> brush<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:38.970> I'm<00:01:39.090> using

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
out nicely and the brush that I'm using

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.390 
out nicely and the brush that I'm using
has<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.810> slight<00:01:40.229> angle<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:40.799> which<00:01:41.100> really

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
has a slight angle to it which really

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.819 
has a slight angle to it which really
helps<00:01:41.729> with<00:01:41.850> this<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.659> make<00:01:42.810> sure<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.470> the

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
helps with this to make sure that the

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.789 
helps with this to make sure that the
matte<00:01:44.310> yellow<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:45.149> as<00:01:45.509> bright<00:01:46.079> as<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.350> can<00:01:46.560> be

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
matte yellow is as bright as it can be

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.010 
matte yellow is as bright as it can be
i'm<00:01:47.070> going<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.460> be<00:01:47.549> using<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:48.119> sticky<00:01:48.509> base<00:01:48.659> and

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
i'm going to be using a sticky base and

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.960 
i'm going to be using a sticky base and
this<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.380> Luna<00:01:49.829> cream<00:01:50.070> color<00:01:50.280> base<00:01:50.490> from<00:01:50.759> Mac

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
this is Luna cream color base from Mac

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.539 
this is Luna cream color base from Mac
I'm<00:01:51.630> making<00:01:52.049> sure<00:01:52.079> this<00:01:52.439> goes<00:01:52.680> on<00:01:52.799> super

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
I'm making sure this goes on super

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.219 
I'm making sure this goes on super
smoothly<00:01:53.880> so<00:01:54.299> that<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.570> yellow<00:01:54.869> doesn't<00:01:55.140> have

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
smoothly so that the yellow doesn't have

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.230 
smoothly so that the yellow doesn't have
a<00:01:55.259> tendency<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:55.860> skip<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.729> look<00:01:56.969> really

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
a tendency to skip and look really

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.149 
a tendency to skip and look really
chalky<00:01:57.509> so<00:01:58.229> now<00:01:58.350> we're<00:01:58.469> going<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.619> go<00:01:58.799> in<00:01:58.979> with

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
chalky so now we're going to go in with

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.980 
chalky so now we're going to go in with
that<00:01:59.399> yellow<00:01:59.729> and<00:02:00.000> i'm<00:02:00.090> using<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.600> stiff

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
that yellow and i'm using a stiff

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.840 
that yellow and i'm using a stiff
concealer<00:02:01.710> brush<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.310> notice<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.640> i'm

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
concealer brush and notice that i'm

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.480 
concealer brush and notice that i'm
really<00:02:03.090> packing<00:02:03.719> this<00:02:03.840> on<00:02:04.079> I'm<00:02:04.560> not<00:02:04.829> sweeping

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
really packing this on I'm not sweeping

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.340 
really packing this on I'm not sweeping
it<00:02:05.640> on<00:02:05.759> because<00:02:05.969> it<00:02:06.240> is<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.390> sticky<00:02:06.869> base<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.320> I

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
it on because it is a sticky base and I

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.410 
it on because it is a sticky base and I
want<00:02:07.530> this<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.710> be<00:02:07.829> as<00:02:07.979> pigmented<00:02:08.580> as<00:02:08.729> possible

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
want this to be as pigmented as possible

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.950 
want this to be as pigmented as possible
without<00:02:10.310> getting<00:02:11.310> Skippy<00:02:11.879> or<00:02:12.300> without

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
without getting Skippy or without

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.740 
without getting Skippy or without
looking<00:02:13.290> like<00:02:13.560> uneven<00:02:13.940> this<00:02:14.940> color<00:02:15.180> does<00:02:15.510> have

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
looking like uneven this color does have

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.600 
looking like uneven this color does have
a<00:02:15.780> little<00:02:16.140> bit<00:02:16.320> of<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:16.620> shimmer<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:17.250> it<00:02:17.280> not

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
a little bit of a shimmer to it not

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.400 
a little bit of a shimmer to it not
enough<00:02:17.850> to<00:02:18.030> really<00:02:18.300> notice<00:02:18.600> but<00:02:18.930> it<00:02:19.050> does<00:02:19.230> help

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
enough to really notice but it does help

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.950 
enough to really notice but it does help
it<00:02:19.620> with<00:02:19.740> blending<00:02:20.250> but<00:02:20.760> even<00:02:20.970> so<00:02:21.420> it<00:02:21.690> still

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
it with blending but even so it still

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.810 
it with blending but even so it still
needs<00:02:22.140> a<00:02:22.200> little<00:02:22.320> TLC<00:02:22.560> I'm<00:02:23.340> going<00:02:23.490> to<00:02:23.550> go<00:02:23.670> in

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
needs a little TLC I'm going to go in

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.730 
needs a little TLC I'm going to go in
with<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:24.240> lime<00:02:24.540> green<00:02:24.960> next<00:02:25.410> and<00:02:25.530> this<00:02:25.620> is

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
with the lime green next and this is

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.010 
with the lime green next and this is
just<00:02:25.920> going<00:02:26.070> into<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.550> outer<00:02:26.730> corners<00:02:27.480> so<00:02:27.960> I'm

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
just going into the outer corners so I'm

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.110 
just going into the outer corners so I'm
just<00:02:28.140> going<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.350> pack<00:02:28.560> this<00:02:28.770> on<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.790> outer

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
just going to pack this on to the outer

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.020 
just going to pack this on to the outer
third<00:02:30.630> of<00:02:31.020> the<00:02:31.380> lid<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:31.890> then<00:02:31.950> make<00:02:32.610> sure<00:02:32.850> that

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
third of the lid and then make sure that

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.480 
third of the lid and then make sure that
it<00:02:33.150> blends<00:02:33.450> super<00:02:34.080> nicely<00:02:34.590> into<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.100> yellow

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
it blends super nicely into the yellow

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.730 
it blends super nicely into the yellow
the<00:02:36.210> easiest<00:02:36.510> way<00:02:36.720> I<00:02:36.750> found<00:02:36.960> to<00:02:37.110> do<00:02:37.320> that<00:02:37.500> is<00:02:37.710> to

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
the easiest way I found to do that is to

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.280 
the easiest way I found to do that is to
use<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.280> somewhat<00:02:38.910> soft<00:02:39.390> brush<00:02:39.690> this<00:02:39.930> is<00:02:40.110> from

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
use a somewhat soft brush this is from

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.560 
use a somewhat soft brush this is from
the<00:02:40.320> Sigma<00:02:40.830> performance<00:02:41.400> collection<00:02:42.030> and<00:02:42.240> I'm

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
the Sigma performance collection and I'm

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.330 
the Sigma performance collection and I'm
just<00:02:42.780> going<00:02:42.960> over<00:02:43.350> where<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:43.950> two<00:02:44.100> colors

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
just going over where the two colors

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.670 
just going over where the two colors
meet<00:02:44.880> back<00:02:45.300> and<00:02:45.510> forth<00:02:45.780> with<00:02:46.350> either<00:02:46.560> the

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
meet back and forth with either the

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.620 
meet back and forth with either the
yellow<00:02:47.010> or<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.310> green<00:02:47.610> until<00:02:48.000> it's<00:02:48.120> right<00:02:48.480> the

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
yellow or the green until it's right the

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.270 
yellow or the green until it's right the
way<00:02:48.750> I<00:02:48.780> want<00:02:49.020> it<00:02:49.110> next<00:02:49.680> I'm<00:02:49.770> going<00:02:49.860> to<00:02:49.920> take<00:02:50.100> the

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
way I want it next I'm going to take the

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.980 
way I want it next I'm going to take the
white<00:02:50.550> and<00:02:50.730> a<00:02:50.820> little<00:02:50.850> bit<00:02:51.330> of<00:02:51.480> that<00:02:51.510> pearl

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
white and a little bit of that pearl

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.840 
white and a little bit of that pearl
shade<00:02:52.410> I<00:02:52.440> just<00:02:52.770> didn't<00:02:53.010> show<00:02:53.070> myself<00:02:53.400> grabbing

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
shade I just didn't show myself grabbing

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.060 
shade I just didn't show myself grabbing
it<00:02:54.120> and<00:02:54.260> I'm<00:02:55.260> just<00:02:55.440> going<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:55.620> use<00:02:55.740> this<00:02:55.860> as<00:02:56.040> a

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
it and I'm just going to use this as a

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.500 
it and I'm just going to use this as a
brow<00:02:56.310> bone<00:02:56.520> highlight<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:57.150> way<00:02:57.240> I'm<00:02:57.360> doing

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
brow bone highlight the way I'm doing

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.150 
brow bone highlight the way I'm doing
this<00:02:57.750> is<00:02:57.960> adding<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.380> white<00:02:58.530> first<00:02:58.800> and<00:02:59.070> then

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
this is adding the white first and then

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.010 
this is adding the white first and then
going<00:02:59.310> over<00:02:59.490> it<00:02:59.730> with<00:02:59.760> the<00:03:00.030> baiji<00:03:00.390> pearl<00:03:00.660> just

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
going over it with the baiji pearl just

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.080 
going over it with the baiji pearl just
to<00:03:01.140> make<00:03:01.290> it<00:03:01.320> a<00:03:01.470> little<00:03:01.590> softer<00:03:01.830> now<00:03:02.820> I'm<00:03:02.880> going

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
to make it a little softer now I'm going

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.630 
to make it a little softer now I'm going
to<00:03:03.180> take<00:03:03.300> my<00:03:03.540> teal<00:03:03.900> inglot<00:03:04.500> liner<00:03:04.920> and<00:03:05.340> line

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
all along the lower lash line so that

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.980 
all along the lower lash line so that
the<00:03:08.220> next<00:03:08.520> shades<00:03:08.790> that<00:03:08.940> I<00:03:09.000> use<00:03:09.300> are<00:03:09.570> super
