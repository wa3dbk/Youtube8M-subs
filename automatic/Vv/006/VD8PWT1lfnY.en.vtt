00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
I don't really have much to resist it so

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.260 
I don't really have much to resist it so
I<00:00:42.620> end<00:00:43.010> up<00:00:43.040> leading<00:00:43.220> off<00:00:43.430> with<00:00:43.580> Victini<00:00:43.970> he

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.899 
at minus-2 but I still am able to do
that<00:01:36.530> because<00:01:36.710> Victini<00:01:37.219> has<00:01:37.460> a<00:01:37.490> decent<00:01:37.729> amount

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
that because Victini has a decent amount

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:39.999 
that because Victini has a decent amount
of<00:01:38.060> speed<00:01:38.270> so<00:01:38.600> that's<00:01:39.319> really<00:01:39.499> nice<00:01:39.740> at<00:01:39.979> least

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
of speed so that's really nice at least

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:41.289 
of speed so that's really nice at least
I'm<00:01:40.280> able<00:01:40.460> to<00:01:40.579> get<00:01:40.670> rid<00:01:40.789> of<00:01:40.850> him<00:01:40.999> for<00:01:41.179> right<00:01:41.270> now

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
I'm able to get rid of him for right now

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.410 
I'm able to get rid of him for right now
and<00:01:41.810> out<00:01:42.289> of<00:01:42.530> the<00:01:42.619> way<00:01:42.799> for<00:01:43.549> right<00:01:44.060> now<00:01:44.090> is

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
and out of the way for right now is

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.539 
and out of the way for right now is
gonna<00:01:44.569> be<00:01:44.689> that<00:01:44.810> Quagsire<00:01:45.350> so<00:01:45.950> he's<00:01:46.399> gonna

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
gonna be that Quagsire so he's gonna

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:48.639 
gonna be that Quagsire so he's gonna
enter<00:01:46.819> brain<00:01:46.999> into<00:01:47.210> our<00:01:47.270> mana<00:01:47.509> tan<00:01:47.810> yeah<00:01:48.409> I

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
enter brain into our mana tan yeah I

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:50.050 
enter brain into our mana tan yeah I
can't<00:01:48.889> really<00:01:49.009> do<00:01:49.159> much<00:01:49.189> to<00:01:49.490> him<00:01:49.609> at<00:01:49.700> all<00:01:49.819> I

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
can't really do much to him at all I

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.520 
can't really do much to him at all I
mean<00:01:50.450> actually<00:01:50.810> V<00:01:50.960> great<00:01:51.170> would<00:01:51.289> actually

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
mean actually V great would actually

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.289 
mean actually V great would actually
probably<00:01:51.649> do<00:01:51.889> a<00:01:51.920> decent<00:01:52.130> map<00:01:52.429> but<00:01:52.729> I<00:01:52.999> don't

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
probably do a decent map but I don't

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.359 
probably do a decent map but I don't
want<00:01:53.509> to<00:01:53.810> risk<00:01:54.109> him<00:01:54.409> you<00:01:54.590> know<00:01:54.710> going<00:01:55.039> for<00:01:55.280> like

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
want to risk him you know going for like

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.160 
want to risk him you know going for like
an<00:01:55.700> earthquake<00:01:55.969> or<00:01:56.329> rock<00:01:56.539> slide<00:01:56.780> or<00:01:56.929> anything

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
an earthquake or rock slide or anything

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.020 
an earthquake or rock slide or anything
like<00:01:57.200> that<00:01:57.350> so<00:01:57.649> I<00:01:58.009> decide<00:01:58.700> to<00:01:58.729> go<00:01:58.850> to<00:01:58.909> my

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
like that so I decide to go to my

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.399 
like that so I decide to go to my
defensive<00:01:59.479> wall<00:01:59.719> which<00:01:59.929> is<00:02:00.049> gonna<00:02:00.170> be<00:02:00.229> my

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
defensive wall which is gonna be my

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:01.870 
defensive wall which is gonna be my
blast<00:02:00.679> so<00:02:00.859> he<00:02:00.920> actually<00:02:01.100> ends<00:02:01.429> up<00:02:01.459> going<00:02:01.639> into

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
blast so he actually ends up going into

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.959 
blast so he actually ends up going into
my<00:02:02.329> shell<00:02:02.689> not<00:02:03.020> exactly<00:02:03.350> sure<00:02:03.560> why<00:02:04.130> because<00:02:04.490> I

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:04.969 
my shell not exactly sure why because I

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:07.330 
my shell not exactly sure why because I
can't<00:02:05.929> really<00:02:06.109> do<00:02:06.469> much<00:02:06.499> to<00:02:06.979> me<00:02:07.130> at<00:02:07.219> all

I end up going in that alakazam now he's

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.720 
I end up going in that alakazam now he's
the<00:03:00.320> problem<00:03:00.530> with<00:03:00.710> doing<00:03:00.860> this<00:03:01.160> may<00:03:01.610> actually

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
the problem with doing this may actually

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.520 
the problem with doing this may actually
stealth<00:03:02.150> speed<00:03:02.390> so<00:03:02.630> if<00:03:02.750> he<00:03:02.840> flinches<00:03:03.230> me<00:03:03.410> to

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
stealth speed so if he flinches me to

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:04.960 
stealth speed so if he flinches me to
death<00:03:03.680> I'm<00:03:03.890> gonna<00:03:04.040> be<00:03:04.190> screwed<00:03:04.610> I<00:03:04.760> probably

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970
