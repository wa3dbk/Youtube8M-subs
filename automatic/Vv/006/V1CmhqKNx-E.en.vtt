00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.950
 hello to you with the channel successful fishing 

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:14.070
 and today i would like to teach you 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.880
 make floating boilies for this to us 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:21.390
 need 1 ordinary cork from under 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.230
 I will use the wine dough 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.220
 purchased 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:29.640
 you can take whatever you yourself 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:33.899
 do with any smell purchase then 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:38.850
 can add flavor with a needle 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:42.269
 thread and scissors and so proceed first 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:48.030
 we take and cut off our ass 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:54.079
 a small piece here I have a little paduk 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:56.129
 I want to take such a piece and take the dough 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:59.879
 take it a little bit 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.940
 and how we roll and shove in 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:06.119
 the middle of our cork instead of the folder you 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:10.680
 can still use foam and 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:13.080
 this baby is such a traffic jam 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:18.800
 but it's more convenient for him to do and then 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:24.240
 take and wrap and make like a ball 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:27.180
 we can go a little roll here with us 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.880
 get a ball if you want to do 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:35.460
 not floating boyle you can just not 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:38.220
 put this cork in there like this 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:44.840
 in action we take our 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:51.570
 needle with thread and pierce our boyle 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:57.900
 take and pierce our ass 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:02:02.280
 passed through pierced need more 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:04.850
 a little shape to fake was he 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.850
 spoils 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.250
 so thats all 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:26.140
 slipped here now we have inside boyle 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:29.170
 our thread and take a little bit now I will hide 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:33.490
 leave somewhere a centimeter two three 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.790
 thread and the other end is also a centimeter 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:39.100
 two is three 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:42.850
 this thread and we get as here 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.830
 such a ball with thread then we take this 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:49.450
 ball with thread and 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:52.780
 on the foil for baking this foil we lay down 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.090
 on a plate we put boyle there 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.480
 the fridge if it sticks to 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:02.980
 it was easier to tear off than from the plate as 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:08.290
 we harden it we take and take 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:14.310
 just found our rope ends we beat 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:19.230
 so we tie it up tightly 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.230
 now a little uncomfortable 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:29.940
 Of course this work is a little laborious. 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:35.080
 do especially if you do them a lot 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:36.100
 you get tired and that's all i tied up here 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:43.230
 ordinary 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:50.050
 2 knots and now we take excess and just 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:54.310
 cut off with a non-floating boilie everything is accurate 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:58.030
 I also don't use pin by 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:01.090
 foam or our folder and now we 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:04.060
 take and crochet how do you use here 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:07.150
 here we push under our bowl and and 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:11.760
 our was ready with you was the channel 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.760
