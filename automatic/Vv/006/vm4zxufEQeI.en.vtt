 job interview to men them 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.350
 I advise you to ask first if this 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.629
 work to which they aspire indicates tie or 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.250
 not so that they do not look overdone in 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.170
 the scenario of the interview if 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.269
 requires a tie then a gray suit 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.690
 Of course it will be the right one with a tie 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:53.339
 fuchsia lilac or pink but requires a tie 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.170
 then they can go with a shirt of very 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:57.449
 good neck of very good invoice and its 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.800
 pants and his dark coat and if they want 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.659
 give a touch of style to that outfit 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.220
 for the interview then use a 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:04.649
 silk handkerchief in the pocket of the 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.330

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:08.550
 with a dress at knee height 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.930

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.060

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.700
 buttons in front and that will give you a touch 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.350
 cooler to your outfit remember the 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.880
 job interview begins with the 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.350
 first impression that you are going to give 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.090
 when the person who interviews you 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.250

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.580

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.580

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.070
 in the forum the web portal closet 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.450
 teleantioquia today we get a question 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.670
 referring to fashion and age 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.740
 our viewer wants to know her 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.900
 what you should do at 40 years old for 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.150

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.930
 follow the trends but in small 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.940
 dose is to say if you are using the 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.190
 pastel shades then I incorporate them 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.470
 in a belt on a shirt or on ones 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.180
 ballerina shoes you should avoid the 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.009
 necklines very tight garments with 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.080

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.009
 seeks whenever you are using ten 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.649
 always at hand a shirt that can 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.360
 informalize your formal looks a lot 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.860
 say the black office pants of 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.440
 every day with a shirt 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.970
 funny or qatar that pencil skirt with 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.250
 a white shirt and jacket 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.260
 Indigo is about lowering the dose of 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.610
 formality but also to always look 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.610
 proudly his 40 years 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.680
 in the closet of see we learn from the 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.510
 hits and mistakes today assists me 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.670
 and these are not addressed to the 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.200
 job interviews for one yes yes 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.030
 those who ask before going to the 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.920
 interview who find out what the 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.290
 charge that they are going to occupy and they are dressed 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.390
 appropriately so not for those who 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.220
 they go with very tight clothes very high 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.530
 with necklines or with accessories very 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.210
 noisy that distract attention so not 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.800
 for men who go from the gym to a 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.780
 job interview with a shirt 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.490
 misaligned and they do not look at the 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.890
 care of your shoes or your belt 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.510
 to convey a good image so yes 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.670
 for women who choose a dress 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.710
 nice shirt or a straight dress and that 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.270
 they take care of your image both in the hair 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.850
 like in makeup and never exaggerate 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.860
 because as the phrase says one does not 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.990
 dresses for the position he has but 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.940
 so that he aspires to be very lucky in 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.250
