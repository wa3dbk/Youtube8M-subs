a lot of people misunderstand the Atari
7800<00:00:42.239> it's<00:00:43.239> actually<00:00:43.570> a<00:00:43.600> really<00:00:43.780> cool<00:00:43.870> console

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:44.469 
7800 it's actually a really cool console

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:47.069 
7800 it's actually a really cool console
and<00:00:44.680> it's<00:00:45.070> great<00:00:45.610> to<00:00:45.910> collect<00:00:46.360> for<00:00:46.629> if<00:00:46.870> you're

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 
and it's great to collect for if you're

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:48.150 
and it's great to collect for if you're
looking<00:00:47.410> for<00:00:47.559> something<00:00:47.770> that's<00:00:48.039> a<00:00:48.129> little

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
looking for something that's a little

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.849 
looking for something that's a little
bit<00:00:48.520> older<00:00:48.879> than<00:00:48.910> the<00:00:49.210> original<00:00:49.539> NES<00:00:49.809> so<00:00:50.230> let's

00:00:50.849 --> 00:00:50.859 
bit older than the original NES so let's

00:00:50.859 --> 00:01:05.490 
bit older than the original NES so let's
take<00:00:51.070> a<00:00:51.100> look

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.899 

all<00:01:06.500> right<00:01:06.710> so<00:01:06.890> here's<00:01:07.100> the<00:01:07.159> console<00:01:07.700> this<00:01:07.850> is

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
all right so here's the console this is

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.790 
all right so here's the console this is
the<00:01:08.150> Atari<00:01:08.800> 7800<00:01:09.800> pro<00:01:10.400> system<00:01:11.000> now<00:01:11.840> back<00:01:12.590> in

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
the Atari 7800 pro system now back in

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.960 
the Atari 7800 pro system now back in
1983<00:01:13.340> Atari<00:01:14.150> learned<00:01:15.050> their<00:01:15.260> lesson

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
1983 Atari learned their lesson

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.490 
1983 Atari learned their lesson
especially<00:01:16.970> coming<00:01:17.180> off<00:01:17.360> of<00:01:17.420> the<00:01:17.720> Atari<00:01:18.020> 5200

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
especially coming off of the Atari 5200

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.370 
especially coming off of the Atari 5200
to<00:01:19.010> 5200<00:01:19.880> while<00:01:20.119> I<00:01:20.420> think<00:01:20.869> most<00:01:21.050> people<00:01:21.290> would

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
to 5200 while I think most people would

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.910 
to 5200 while I think most people would
consider<00:01:21.500> you<00:01:22.160> know<00:01:22.310> mostly<00:01:22.700> a<00:01:22.790> success<00:01:23.920> it

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
consider you know mostly a success it

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.980 
consider you know mostly a success it
took<00:01:25.160> a<00:01:25.190> beating<00:01:25.550> in<00:01:25.940> reviews<00:01:26.330> and<00:01:26.600> also<00:01:26.869> with

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
took a beating in reviews and also with

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.249 
took a beating in reviews and also with
gamers<00:01:27.380> because<00:01:27.560> it<00:01:28.009> was<00:01:28.130> super<00:01:28.700> big<00:01:29.259> really

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
gamers because it was super big really

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.140 
gamers because it was super big really
really<00:01:30.530> big<00:01:30.740> actually<00:01:31.220> it<00:01:31.550> might<00:01:31.820> be<00:01:31.940> one<00:01:32.060> of

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
really big actually it might be one of

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.790 
really big actually it might be one of
the<00:01:32.210> biggest<00:01:32.360> consoles<00:01:32.840> ever<00:01:33.050> released<00:01:33.530> and

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
the biggest consoles ever released and

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.510 
the biggest consoles ever released and
so<00:01:34.400> they<00:01:34.970> made<00:01:35.150> sure<00:01:35.360> made<00:01:35.630> the<00:01:36.050> 7800<00:01:36.800> much

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
so they made sure made the 7800 much

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.870 
so they made sure made the 7800 much
smaller<00:01:37.940> much<00:01:38.509> more<00:01:38.570> compact<00:01:39.289> and<00:01:39.670> they<00:01:40.670> also

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
smaller much more compact and they also

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.310 
smaller much more compact and they also
learned<00:01:41.270> a<00:01:41.360> lot<00:01:41.539> when<00:01:41.750> it<00:01:41.869> came<00:01:42.020> to<00:01:42.200> the

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
learned a lot when it came to the

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.810 
learned a lot when it came to the
joystick<00:01:42.940> the<00:01:43.940> 5200<00:01:44.660> had<00:01:44.840> this<00:01:44.990> really<00:01:45.259> floppy

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
joystick the 5200 had this really floppy

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.029 
joystick the 5200 had this really floppy
breakable<00:01:46.820> joystick<00:01:47.479> and<00:01:47.720> they<00:01:48.320> got<00:01:48.560> back<00:01:48.830> to

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:49.039 
breakable joystick and they got back to

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:51.279 
breakable joystick and they got back to
what<00:01:49.220> made<00:01:49.460> the<00:01:50.119> original<00:01:50.149> Atari<00:01:50.930> joystick

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
what made the original Atari joystick

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:53.889 
what made the original Atari joystick
great<00:01:51.470> which<00:01:51.649> is<00:01:51.830> all<00:01:52.070> digital<00:01:52.390> very<00:01:53.390> simple

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
great which is all digital very simple

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.169 
great which is all digital very simple
and<00:01:54.080> they<00:01:54.890> mostly<00:01:55.340> nailed<00:01:55.700> it<00:01:55.910> with<00:01:56.000> this

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
and they mostly nailed it with this

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:59.169 
and they mostly nailed it with this
console<00:01:56.570> although<00:01:57.399> most<00:01:58.399> people<00:01:58.520> agree<00:01:58.970> it's

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
console although most people agree it's

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:01.779 
console although most people agree it's
not<00:01:59.270> the<00:01:59.570> most<00:01:59.750> comfortable<00:02:00.789> joystick

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
not the most comfortable joystick

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:04.660 
not the most comfortable joystick
because<00:02:02.570> it<00:02:03.350> seems<00:02:03.649> to<00:02:03.890> me<00:02:04.070> at<00:02:04.220> least<00:02:04.250> the

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
because it seems to me at least the

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.550 
because it seems to me at least the
center<00:02:05.210> of<00:02:05.330> gravity<00:02:05.479> is<00:02:06.020> a<00:02:06.050> little<00:02:06.320> bit<00:02:06.440> off

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
center of gravity is a little bit off

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.080 
center of gravity is a little bit off
when<00:02:06.800> you're<00:02:07.039> when<00:02:07.520> you're<00:02:07.670> messing<00:02:07.820> around

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
when you're when you're messing around

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.279 
when you're when you're messing around
with<00:02:08.240> a<00:02:08.330> joystick<00:02:08.509> and<00:02:09.020> you're<00:02:09.110> pushing

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
with a joystick and you're pushing

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.370 
with a joystick and you're pushing
forward<00:02:10.090> it<00:02:11.090> just<00:02:11.360> seems<00:02:11.540> like<00:02:11.660> it<00:02:11.959> doesn't

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
forward it just seems like it doesn't

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.230 
forward it just seems like it doesn't
stay<00:02:12.830> in<00:02:12.860> your<00:02:13.069> hand<00:02:13.340> very<00:02:13.430> well<00:02:13.730> there's<00:02:14.180> a

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
stay in your hand very well there's a

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.780 
stay in your hand very well there's a
lot<00:02:14.540> of<00:02:14.780> fatigue<00:02:15.500> when<00:02:15.980> using<00:02:16.160> this<00:02:16.370> disk

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
lot of fatigue when using this disk

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.750 
lot of fatigue when using this disk
controller<00:02:17.180> and<00:02:17.420> playing<00:02:17.599> some<00:02:17.840> of<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:17.990> games

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
controller and playing some of the games

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.000 
controller and playing some of the games
but<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:20.150> they<00:02:20.900> were<00:02:20.959> really<00:02:21.230> looking<00:02:21.410> forward

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
but the they were really looking forward

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.550 
but the they were really looking forward
to<00:02:22.730> putting<00:02:22.880> this<00:02:23.090> out<00:02:23.239> in<00:02:23.450> 1984<00:02:24.140> there<00:02:24.470> was

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
to putting this out in 1984 there was

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.110 
to putting this out in 1984 there was
actually<00:02:24.860> backwards<00:02:25.400> compatibility<00:02:25.910> with

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
actually backwards compatibility with

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.190 
actually backwards compatibility with
all<00:02:26.540> or<00:02:26.959> most<00:02:27.620> of<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:27.980> Atari<00:02:28.340> 2600<00:02:28.910> games<00:02:29.300> they

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
all or most of the Atari 2600 games they

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.650 
all or most of the Atari 2600 games they
also<00:02:30.380> had<00:02:30.680> planned<00:02:31.220> expandability<00:02:32.120> with<00:02:32.510> this

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
also had planned expandability with this

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.220 
also had planned expandability with this
console<00:02:33.349> as<00:02:33.470> well<00:02:33.500> they<00:02:34.220> had<00:02:34.370> planned<00:02:34.640> on

of<00:02:40.370> an<00:02:40.489> interesting<00:02:40.730> idea<00:02:41.000> I<00:02:41.300> mean<00:02:41.480> think

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
of an interesting idea I mean think

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.830 
of an interesting idea I mean think
about<00:02:42.489> space<00:02:43.489> aids<00:02:43.819> and<00:02:44.030> Dragon's<00:02:44.540> Lair<00:02:44.690> at

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
the time and how cool it would have been

gaming console per se he was actually

computer<00:03:27.770> market<00:03:27.800> things<00:03:28.790> like<00:03:28.940> the

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
computer market things like the

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.809 
computer market things like the
Commodore<00:03:30.080> 64<00:03:30.170> were<00:03:30.830> much<00:03:31.160> more<00:03:31.310> interesting

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
Commodore 64 were much more interesting

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.660 
Commodore 64 were much more interesting
to<00:03:31.970> Atari<00:03:32.300> at<00:03:32.420> the<00:03:32.480> time<00:03:32.720> and<00:03:33.670> unfortunately

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
to Atari at the time and unfortunately

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.660 
to Atari at the time and unfortunately
the<00:03:35.660> 1700<00:03:36.319> just<00:03:36.470> sat<00:03:36.680> there<00:03:36.709> and<00:03:37.160> gathered

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
the 1700 just sat there and gathered

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.320 
the 1700 just sat there and gathered
dust<00:03:37.989> meanwhile<00:03:39.220> Nintendo<00:03:40.220> and<00:03:40.550> also<00:03:41.030> Sega

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
dust meanwhile Nintendo and also Sega

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.070 
dust meanwhile Nintendo and also Sega
were<00:03:42.170> starting<00:03:42.680> to<00:03:42.910> kick<00:03:43.910> off<00:03:44.150> the<00:03:44.660> video<00:03:44.780> game

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
were starting to kick off the video game

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.530 
were starting to kick off the video game
console<00:03:45.560> market<00:03:45.860> again<00:03:46.190> and<00:03:46.550> so<00:03:46.880> by<00:03:47.090> the<00:03:47.150> time

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
console market again and so by the time

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.770 
console market again and so by the time
that<00:03:47.810> this<00:03:47.930> was<00:03:47.989> released<00:03:48.500> and<00:03:48.910> I<00:03:49.910> guess<00:03:50.630> it

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
that this was released and I guess it

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.220 
that this was released and I guess it
was<00:03:50.810> 1986<00:03:52.060> it<00:03:53.060> was<00:03:53.209> too<00:03:53.420> late<00:03:53.630> for<00:03:53.690> Atari

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
was 1986 it was too late for Atari

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:02.320 
was 1986 it was too late for Atari
people<00:03:55.040> had<00:03:55.190> moved<00:03:55.400> on<00:03:55.550> now<00:04:00.819> by<00:04:01.819> comparison

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
people had moved on now by comparison

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.840 
people had moved on now by comparison
actually<00:04:02.660> the<00:04:03.019> 7800<00:04:03.800> is<00:04:03.950> a<00:04:04.010> pretty<00:04:04.580> powerful

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
actually the 7800 is a pretty powerful

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.660 
actually the 7800 is a pretty powerful
console<00:04:05.540> at<00:04:05.690> the<00:04:05.720> time<00:04:05.810> is<00:04:06.200> actually<00:04:06.670> fairly

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
console at the time is actually fairly

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.300 
console at the time is actually fairly
comparable<00:04:08.239> to<00:04:08.600> the<00:04:08.989> original<00:04:09.440> Nintendo<00:04:10.100> NES

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
comparable to the original Nintendo NES

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.540 
comparable to the original Nintendo NES
and<00:04:10.700> the<00:04:11.330> Master<00:04:11.750> System<00:04:12.040> except<00:04:13.040> for<00:04:13.280> one

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
and the Master System except for one

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.659 
and the Master System except for one
area<00:04:13.880> and<00:04:14.239> that<00:04:14.420> was<00:04:14.630> sound

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:15.669 
area and that was sound

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:18.520 
area and that was sound
unfortunately<00:04:16.669> they<00:04:17.540> included<00:04:18.079> the<00:04:18.229> exact

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
unfortunately they included the exact

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.949 
unfortunately they included the exact
same<00:04:18.739> sound<00:04:19.070> chip<00:04:19.310> on<00:04:19.519> this<00:04:20.090> that<00:04:20.540> was<00:04:20.720> in<00:04:20.870> the

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
same sound chip on this that was in the

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.090 
same sound chip on this that was in the
original<00:04:21.049> Atari<00:04:22.010> from<00:04:22.540> 1977<00:04:23.540> so<00:04:23.990> sound<00:04:24.919> is

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
original Atari from 1977 so sound is

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.770 
original Atari from 1977 so sound is
definitely<00:04:25.580> the<00:04:25.880> weakest<00:04:26.270> part<00:04:26.540> of<00:04:26.690> this

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
definitely the weakest part of this

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:33.520 
definitely the weakest part of this
console<00:04:27.260> and<00:04:27.470> it's<00:04:27.590> unfortunate<00:04:32.320> now<00:04:33.320> like

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
console and it's unfortunate now like

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.070 
console and it's unfortunate now like
any<00:04:33.740> gamer<00:04:34.010> knows<00:04:34.419> yes<00:04:35.419> the<00:04:35.600> hardware<00:04:35.960> is

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
any gamer knows yes the hardware is

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.260 
any gamer knows yes the hardware is
important<00:04:36.620> but<00:04:36.950> it's<00:04:37.160> all<00:04:37.340> about<00:04:37.820> the<00:04:38.000> games

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
important but it's all about the games

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.240 
important but it's all about the games
and<00:04:38.660> what<00:04:39.080> developers<00:04:39.500> do<00:04:39.680> with<00:04:39.830> them<00:04:39.979> so<00:04:40.130> I'm

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
and what developers do with them so I'm

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.110 
and what developers do with them so I'm
going<00:04:40.370> to<00:04:40.430> show<00:04:40.490> you<00:04:40.520> some<00:04:40.729> gameplay<00:04:41.090> footage

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
going to show you some gameplay footage

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.740 
going to show you some gameplay footage
now

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
now

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.130 
now
the<00:04:42.470> deal<00:04:42.710> is<00:04:42.919> is<00:04:43.280> that<00:04:43.580> because<00:04:44.030> the<00:04:44.240> 7800<00:04:45.020> is

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
the deal is is that because the 7800 is

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.279 
the deal is is that because the 7800 is
so<00:04:45.289> old<00:04:45.590> it<00:04:45.890> uses<00:04:46.190> the<00:04:46.310> old<00:04:46.460> RF<00:04:47.000> connections<00:04:47.539> to

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:48.289 
so old it uses the old RF connections to

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:49.480 
so old it uses the old RF connections to
your<00:04:48.440> television<00:04:48.740> that<00:04:49.100> it's<00:04:49.220> actually

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
your television that it's actually

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.430 
your television that it's actually
pretty<00:04:49.640> hard<00:04:49.970> to<00:04:50.060> capture<00:04:50.479> video<00:04:50.630> footage<00:04:51.080> in

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
pretty hard to capture video footage in

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.950 
pretty hard to capture video footage in
a<00:04:52.100> decent<00:04:52.310> way<00:04:52.550> and<00:04:52.880> so<00:04:53.090> I'm<00:04:53.570> actually<00:04:53.750> going

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
a decent way and so I'm actually going

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.890 
a decent way and so I'm actually going
to<00:04:54.020> do<00:04:54.200> emulation<00:04:55.100> and<00:04:55.300> I'm<00:04:56.300> playing<00:04:56.600> it<00:04:56.750> on

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
to do emulation and I'm playing it on

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.290 
to do emulation and I'm playing it on
actual<00:04:57.350> PC<00:04:57.770> that<00:04:57.890> I'm<00:04:57.979> capturing<00:04:58.460> here<00:04:58.760> so

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
actual PC that I'm capturing here so

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.779 
actual PC that I'm capturing here so
it's<00:04:59.570> not<00:04:59.840> perfect<00:05:00.500> and<00:05:00.770> actually<00:05:01.190> emulation

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:01.789 
it's not perfect and actually emulation

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:04.450 
it's not perfect and actually emulation
for<00:05:02.000> the<00:05:02.150> 1700<00:05:02.690> is<00:05:02.810> not<00:05:03.050> perfect<00:05:03.979> it's<00:05:04.160> not<00:05:04.220> as

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
for the 1700 is not perfect it's not as

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.820 
for the 1700 is not perfect it's not as
refined<00:05:05.030> as<00:05:05.270> some<00:05:05.419> other<00:05:05.570> consoles<00:05:06.080> so<00:05:06.289> you

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
refined as some other consoles so you

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.680 
refined as some other consoles so you
know<00:05:06.950> forgive<00:05:07.340> the<00:05:07.550> quality<00:05:08.030> aspects<00:05:08.419> of<00:05:08.570> it

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
know forgive the quality aspects of it

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.290 
know forgive the quality aspects of it
but<00:05:08.930> it<00:05:09.080> gives<00:05:09.260> you<00:05:09.410> an<00:05:09.650> idea<00:05:10.000> about<00:05:11.000> what<00:05:11.210> the

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
but it gives you an idea about what the

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:54.070 
but it gives you an idea about what the
games<00:05:11.510> were<00:05:11.720> like

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.700 

I<00:05:54.110> remember<00:05:54.919> pretty<00:05:55.099> vividly<00:05:55.580> back<00:05:55.910> in<00:05:56.120> around

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
I remember pretty vividly back in around

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.499 
I remember pretty vividly back in around
1987<00:05:57.710> when<00:05:58.370> I<00:05:58.400> was<00:05:58.580> still<00:05:58.699> in<00:05:58.819> high<00:05:58.970> school<00:05:59.000> and

00:05:59.499 --> 00:05:59.509 
1987 when I was still in high school and

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:01.930 
1987 when I was still in high school and
the<00:05:59.930> 7,800<00:06:00.620> came<00:06:00.830> out<00:06:01.009> and<00:06:01.310> you<00:06:01.610> know<00:06:01.729> I<00:06:01.910> just

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.200 
the 7,800 came out and you know I just
wasn't<00:06:02.389> interested<00:06:02.960> in<00:06:03.289> it<00:06:03.440> at<00:06:03.560> all<00:06:03.620> and

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 
wasn't interested in it at all and

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.300 
wasn't interested in it at all and
that's<00:06:05.210> because<00:06:05.569> I<00:06:05.599> had<00:06:05.990> a<00:06:06.020> calmer<00:06:06.379> 64<00:06:06.949> and<00:06:07.220> I

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
that's because I had a calmer 64 and I

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.110 
that's because I had a calmer 64 and I

00:07:05.439 --> 00:07:05.449 
for that reason I actually get excited

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:07.330 
for that reason I actually get excited
when<00:07:05.569> I<00:07:05.630> find<00:07:05.930> another<00:07:06.620> game<00:07:06.919> that<00:07:07.130> I<00:07:07.159> don't

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:07.340 
when I find another game that I don't

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:08.830 
when I find another game that I don't
have<00:07:07.460> my<00:07:07.610> collection<00:07:07.789> because<00:07:08.270> it's<00:07:08.419> it's<00:07:08.750> a

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:08.840 
have my collection because it's it's a

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.809 
have my collection because it's it's a
little<00:07:09.110> unusual<00:07:09.199> and<00:07:10.159> it<00:07:10.250> doesn't<00:07:10.490> cost<00:07:10.610> a<00:07:10.789> lot

00:07:10.809 --> 00:07:10.819 
little unusual and it doesn't cost a lot

00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:14.379 
little unusual and it doesn't cost a lot
so<00:07:11.349> the<00:07:12.349> other<00:07:12.590> benefit<00:07:13.069> being<00:07:13.279> that<00:07:14.150> the

00:07:14.379 --> 00:07:14.389 
so the other benefit being that the

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:20.230 
so the other benefit being that the
1,700<00:07:15.080> plays<00:07:15.340> hundreds<00:07:16.340> of<00:07:18.310> Atari<00:07:19.310> 2600<00:07:19.819> games

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:20.240 
1,700 plays hundreds of Atari 2600 games

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.959 
1,700 plays hundreds of Atari 2600 games
and<00:07:20.509> that's<00:07:21.319> a<00:07:21.500> that's<00:07:21.650> a<00:07:21.889> cool<00:07:22.130> benefit<00:07:22.699> to<00:07:22.880> it

00:07:22.959 --> 00:07:22.969 
and that's a that's a cool benefit to it

00:07:22.969 --> 00:07:25.330 
and that's a that's a cool benefit to it
because<00:07:23.180> you<00:07:23.330> can<00:07:23.509> own<00:07:23.779> that<00:07:24.229> console<00:07:24.860> and<00:07:25.130> you

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:25.340 
because you can own that console and you

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:26.920 
because you can own that console and you
only<00:07:25.490> need<00:07:25.699> one<00:07:25.909> of<00:07:25.940> them<00:07:26.120> to<00:07:26.180> literally<00:07:26.630> play

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:26.930 
only need one of them to literally play

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:29.769 
only need one of them to literally play
hundreds<00:07:27.319> of<00:07:27.440> games<00:07:27.729> the<00:07:28.729> trick<00:07:29.029> being<00:07:29.270> here

00:07:29.769 --> 00:07:29.779 
hundreds of games the trick being here

00:07:29.779 --> 00:07:31.809 
hundreds of games the trick being here
is<00:07:29.930> that<00:07:30.529> when<00:07:30.710> you<00:07:30.800> go<00:07:30.949> into<00:07:31.130> a<00:07:31.250> retro<00:07:31.610> gaming

00:07:31.809 --> 00:07:31.819 
is that when you go into a retro gaming

00:07:31.819 --> 00:07:34.890 
is that when you go into a retro gaming
store<00:07:32.690> and<00:07:33.020> you<00:07:33.289> see<00:07:33.440> a<00:07:33.469> wall<00:07:33.800> of<00:07:34.069> Atari<00:07:34.400> games

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:34.900 
store and you see a wall of Atari games

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.959 
store and you see a wall of Atari games
the<00:07:35.900> 1,700<00:07:36.680> games<00:07:36.860> stick<00:07:37.190> out<00:07:37.370> if<00:07:37.669> you<00:07:37.849> know

00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:37.969 
the 1,700 games stick out if you know

00:07:37.969 --> 00:07:39.850 
the 1,700 games stick out if you know
what<00:07:38.120> to<00:07:38.180> look<00:07:38.210> for<00:07:38.630> they're<00:07:38.990> in<00:07:39.169> a<00:07:39.289> sea<00:07:39.830> of

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:39.860 
what to look for they're in a sea of

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:44.469 
what to look for they're in a sea of
colors<00:07:40.490> and<00:07:41.120> crazy<00:07:41.779> labels<00:07:42.460> most<00:07:43.460> of<00:07:43.699> the<00:07:43.819> 1700

00:07:44.469 --> 00:07:44.479 
colors and crazy labels most of the 1700

00:07:44.479 --> 00:07:47.320 
colors and crazy labels most of the 1700
games<00:07:44.659> are<00:07:44.900> kind<00:07:45.199> of<00:07:45.289> this<00:07:45.469> dull<00:07:45.919> boring<00:07:46.580> grey

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:47.330 
games are kind of this dull boring grey

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.019 
games are kind of this dull boring grey
and<00:07:47.690> so<00:07:47.960> it's<00:07:48.319> I<00:07:48.770> don't<00:07:49.279> know<00:07:49.370> what<00:07:49.550> what<00:07:49.759> Atari

00:07:50.019 --> 00:07:50.029 
and so it's I don't know what what Atari

00:07:50.029 --> 00:07:52.390 
and so it's I don't know what what Atari
was<00:07:50.180> thinking<00:07:50.539> the<00:07:50.960> they're<00:07:51.590> not<00:07:51.710> exciting<00:07:52.279> in

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:52.400 
was thinking the they're not exciting in

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.029 
was thinking the they're not exciting in
any<00:07:52.520> way<00:07:52.729> so<00:07:53.360> it's<00:07:53.779> easy<00:07:54.020> when<00:07:54.830> you're<00:07:54.979> a

00:07:55.029 --> 00:07:55.039 
any way so it's easy when you're a

00:07:55.039 --> 00:07:58.240 
any way so it's easy when you're a
collector<00:07:55.430> to<00:07:55.849> find<00:07:56.240> them<00:07:56.360> fairly<00:07:56.569> quickly<00:07:57.250> so

00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:58.250 
collector to find them fairly quickly so

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:00.969 
collector to find them fairly quickly so
