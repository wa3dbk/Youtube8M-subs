excited this is so cool it's going to be
hard<00:00:28.810> to<00:00:28.900> do<00:00:29.019> with<00:00:29.199> just<00:00:29.410> one<00:00:29.560> hand<00:00:29.920> but<00:00:31.019> let<00:00:32.019> me

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
hard to do with just one hand but let me

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.410 
hard to do with just one hand but let me
let<00:00:32.439> me<00:00:32.500> run<00:00:32.710> you<00:00:32.739> through<00:00:32.860> it<00:00:33.190> here<00:00:33.489> and<00:00:33.670> show

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
let me run you through it here and show

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.380 
let me run you through it here and show
you<00:00:34.589> what<00:00:35.589> we<00:00:35.710> did

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
you what we did

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.759 
you what we did
still<00:00:37.809> looks<00:00:38.049> original<00:00:39.269> okay<00:00:40.269> get<00:00:40.930> the<00:00:41.080> Ani

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:41.769 
still looks original okay get the Ani

switch<00:00:43.420> here<00:00:43.720> still<00:00:44.559> have<00:00:44.739> we<00:00:45.519> move<00:00:45.760> the

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:46.080 
switch here still have we move the

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.229 
switch here still have we move the
adjustment<00:00:47.080> pot<00:00:47.260> out<00:00:47.500> here<00:00:48.119> I'll<00:00:49.119> probably

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
adjustment pot out here I'll probably

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:50.430 
adjustment pot out here I'll probably
end<00:00:49.479> up<00:00:49.570> cutting<00:00:49.809> that<00:00:49.960> down<00:00:50.260> a<00:00:50.320> little

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
end up cutting that down a little

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.100 
end up cutting that down a little
shorter<00:00:51.150> let<00:00:52.150> me<00:00:52.210> get<00:00:52.330> you<00:00:52.449> in<00:00:52.479> macro<00:00:52.809> hold<00:00:52.989> on

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
shorter let me get you in macro hold on

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.000 
shorter let me get you in macro hold on
one<00:00:53.260> second<00:00:54.600> so<00:00:55.600> we<00:00:56.199> still<00:00:56.440> have<00:00:56.559> the<00:00:56.650> on/off

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
one second so we still have the on/off

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.850 
one second so we still have the on/off
switch<00:00:57.040> you<00:00:57.940> see<00:00:58.089> a<00:00:58.119> little<00:00:58.239> light<00:00:58.479> glowing<00:00:58.860> we

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
switch you see a little light glowing we

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.899 
switch you see a little light glowing we
moved<00:01:00.190> the<00:01:00.970> adjustment<00:01:01.510> pot<00:01:01.830> sensitivity

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:02.909 
moved the adjustment pot sensitivity

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:06.350 
moved the adjustment pot sensitivity

cool half of the cool part so we move

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.020 
cool half of the cool part so we move
the<00:01:32.010> sensitivity<00:01:33.010> pot<00:01:33.190> to<00:01:33.400> the<00:01:33.490> side<00:01:33.730> here

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
the sensitivity pot to the side here

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.420 
the sensitivity pot to the side here
just<00:01:35.020> drilled<00:01:35.350> for<00:01:35.620> the<00:01:35.680> legs<00:01:35.920> to<00:01:36.100> go<00:01:36.220> through

there again hot glue the crap out of it
I<00:01:53.250> pulled<00:01:54.250> two<00:01:54.610> wires<00:01:55.530> being<00:01:56.530> that<00:01:56.680> this<00:01:56.770> is<00:01:56.830> a

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
I pulled two wires being that this is a

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.740 
I pulled two wires being that this is a
cat5<00:01:57.460> wire<00:01:57.820> there<00:01:58.600> is<00:02:00.060> orange<00:02:01.060> orange<00:02:01.390> with<00:02:01.690> a

cat5 wire there is orange orange with a
stripe<00:02:02.020> and<00:02:02.740> the<00:02:02.860> same<00:02:03.070> goes<00:02:03.250> for<00:02:03.280> brown<00:02:04.090> green

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
stripe and the same goes for brown green

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.590 
stripe and the same goes for brown green
and<00:02:04.570> blue<00:02:05.100> so<00:02:06.100> all<00:02:06.880> the<00:02:07.000> way<00:02:07.090> at<00:02:07.150> the<00:02:07.210> other<00:02:07.270> end

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
and blue so all the way at the other end

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.499 
and blue so all the way at the other end
I<00:02:07.900> added<00:02:08.500> something<00:02:08.739> and<00:02:09.069> to<00:02:09.819> do<00:02:09.970> so<00:02:10.179> I<00:02:10.209> had<00:02:10.420> to

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
I added something and to do so I had to

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.640 
I added something and to do so I had to
extend<00:02:10.929> it<00:02:12.480> he<00:02:13.500> with<00:02:14.500> my<00:02:14.680> fingers

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
extend it he with my fingers

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.510

here<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:17.690> here<00:02:18.709> and<00:02:19.709> I've<00:02:19.830> hot<00:02:20.010> glued<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.280> end

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
here and here and I've hot glued the end

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.540 
here and here and I've hot glued the end
so<00:02:20.700> that<00:02:20.730> they<00:02:20.910> don't<00:02:21.170> mess<00:02:22.170> with<00:02:22.200> anything<00:02:22.550> on

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
so that they don't mess with anything on

so that they don't mess with anything on
the<00:02:23.610> other<00:02:23.670> end<00:02:24.030> we<00:02:25.020> have<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.290> coolest<00:02:25.620> part

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
the other end we have the coolest part

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:33.100 
the other end we have the coolest part
of<00:02:25.920> all<00:02:26.600> check<00:02:27.600> it<00:02:27.750> out<00:02:29.330> we<00:02:30.330> made<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:30.540> probe

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.640 

half-inch<00:02:34.110> PVC<00:02:35.540> right<00:02:36.540> here<00:02:36.750> cut<00:02:37.440> it<00:02:37.530> with<00:02:37.620> a

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
half-inch PVC right here cut it with a

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.330 
half-inch PVC right here cut it with a
hacksaw<00:02:37.709> I<00:02:38.990> got<00:02:39.990> some<00:02:40.140> still<00:02:40.350> photos<00:02:40.709> for<00:02:41.250> the

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
hacksaw I got some still photos for the

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.770 
hacksaw I got some still photos for the
process<00:02:41.730> that<00:02:41.760> I'll<00:02:42.000> attach<00:02:42.300> at<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.510> end<00:02:42.690> of

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
process that I'll attach at the end of

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.809 
process that I'll attach at the end of
this<00:02:42.870> hot<00:02:43.770> glue<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.070> crap<00:02:44.280> out<00:02:44.489> of<00:02:44.520> it<00:02:44.700> and

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
this hot glue the crap out of it and

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.260 
this hot glue the crap out of it and
you're<00:02:45.300> probably<00:02:45.480> wondering<00:02:45.959> what<00:02:46.800> is<00:02:46.920> that

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
you're probably wondering what is that

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.920 
you're probably wondering what is that
mysterious<00:02:48.270> bubble<00:02:49.020> on<00:02:49.170> there<00:02:49.890> well<00:02:50.520> I<00:02:50.900> put<00:02:51.900> a

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
mysterious bubble on there well I put a

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.199 
mysterious bubble on there well I put a
vibration<00:02:52.620> motor<00:02:52.860> in<00:02:53.070> this<00:02:53.250> sucker<00:02:53.489> that's

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
vibration motor in this sucker that's

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.180 
vibration motor in this sucker that's
right<00:02:54.480> you<00:02:54.690> can<00:02:54.840> see<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:54.959> little<00:02:55.140> red<00:02:55.680> wire<00:02:55.950> in

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
right you can see the little red wire in

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.500 
right you can see the little red wire in
there<00:02:57.050> the<00:02:58.050> two<00:02:58.260> wires<00:02:58.530> that<00:02:58.769> go<00:02:58.830> in<00:02:59.100> there<00:02:59.510> run

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
there the two wires that go in there run

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.340 
there the two wires that go in there run
through<00:03:00.780> here<00:03:01.170> and<00:03:01.640> I<00:03:02.640> soldered<00:03:03.239> them<00:03:03.420> onto

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
through here and I soldered them onto

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.720 
through here and I soldered them onto
the<00:03:04.470> board<00:03:04.739> on<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:06.180> backside<00:03:07.730> underneath

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
the board on the backside underneath

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.009 
the board on the backside underneath
that<00:03:08.940> buzzer<00:03:11.300> it<00:03:12.300> runs<00:03:12.570> through<00:03:12.720> all<00:03:12.900> the

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
that buzzer it runs through all the

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.070 
that buzzer it runs through all the
resistors<00:03:13.880> the<00:03:14.880> vibration<00:03:15.420> motor<00:03:15.600> I<00:03:15.690> use<00:03:15.930> is

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
resistors the vibration motor I use is

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.750 
resistors the vibration motor I use is
the<00:03:16.170> same<00:03:16.320> one<00:03:16.500> I<00:03:16.530> use<00:03:16.709> in<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.010> Sentech<00:03:17.459> and

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
the same one I use in the Sentech and

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.970 
the same one I use in the Sentech and
it's<00:03:18.239> only<00:03:18.420> rated<00:03:18.570> for<00:03:18.720> 3<00:03:19.050> volts<00:03:19.440> and<00:03:19.560> this<00:03:19.920> is

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
it's only rated for 3 volts and this is

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.830 
it's only rated for 3 volts and this is
a<00:03:20.070> 9<00:03:20.340> volt<00:03:20.579> system<00:03:21.030> so<00:03:21.269> you<00:03:21.360> have<00:03:21.480> to<00:03:21.630> find

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
a 9 volt system so you have to find

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.080 
a 9 volt system so you have to find
somewhere<00:03:22.320> on<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.829> board<00:03:23.010> that<00:03:23.519> runs<00:03:23.730> off<00:03:23.910> of

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
somewhere on the board that runs off of

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.910 
somewhere on the board that runs off of
resistors<00:03:24.630> to<00:03:24.660> bring<00:03:24.989> it<00:03:25.110> bring<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.590> voltage

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
resistors to bring it bring the voltage

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.280 
resistors to bring it bring the voltage
down<00:03:26.160> and<00:03:26.519> it<00:03:27.060> brings<00:03:27.180> a<00:03:27.329> voltage<00:03:27.690> variable<00:03:28.049> as

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
down and it brings a voltage variable as

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.690 
down and it brings a voltage variable as
well<00:03:28.500> so<00:03:29.840> let<00:03:30.840> me<00:03:30.959> close<00:03:31.680> this<00:03:31.950> sucker<00:03:32.190> up

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
well so let me close this sucker up

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.819 
well so let me close this sucker up
and<00:03:33.239> give<00:03:33.390> you<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.570> run-through<00:03:35.870> so<00:03:36.870> here<00:03:37.709> it

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
and give you the run-through so here it

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:39.759 
and give you the run-through so here it
is<00:03:37.950> with<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:38.790> cover<00:03:38.970> back<00:03:39.180> on

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
is with the cover back on

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:45.259 
is with the cover back on
we<00:03:40.769> turn<00:03:40.980> it<00:03:41.010> on<00:03:41.220> and<00:03:42.140> you<00:03:43.140> can<00:03:43.700> faintly<00:03:44.700> dimly

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
we turn it on and you can faintly dimly

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.190 
we turn it on and you can faintly dimly
maybe<00:03:46.260> see<00:03:46.950> the<00:03:47.100> red<00:03:47.280> light<00:03:47.489> in<00:03:47.670> there

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
maybe see the red light in there

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.440 
maybe see the red light in there
and<00:03:49.200> we<00:03:49.470> have<00:03:49.620> our<00:03:49.739> adjustment<00:03:50.190> pot<00:03:50.400> you<00:03:51.269> might

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
and we have our adjustment pot you might

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.640 
and we have our adjustment pot you might
be<00:03:51.570> able<00:03:51.690> to<00:03:51.780> hear<00:03:51.900> it<00:03:51.989> if<00:03:52.079> I<00:03:52.140> get<00:03:52.290> close<00:03:52.470> enough

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
be able to hear it if I get close enough

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.830 
be able to hear it if I get close enough
you<00:03:53.040> see<00:03:53.549> the<00:03:53.610> light<00:03:53.790> getting<00:03:53.970> brighter<00:03:56.840> when

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
you see the light getting brighter when

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.360 
you see the light getting brighter when
you<00:03:57.930> hear<00:03:58.079> the<00:03:58.200> buzz<00:03:58.440> it<00:03:59.340> vibrates<00:04:00.049> let<00:04:01.049> me<00:04:01.370> put

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
you hear the buzz it vibrates let me put

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.460 
you hear the buzz it vibrates let me put
this<00:04:02.549> camera<00:04:03.209> here<00:04:03.510> and<00:04:04.250> show<00:04:05.250> you<00:04:06.320> take<00:04:07.320> my

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
this camera here and show you take my

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:14.479 
this camera here and show you take my
that's<00:04:07.709> a<00:04:09.049> that's<00:04:10.049> a<00:04:10.230> titanium<00:04:10.680> ring<00:04:11.160> I<00:04:13.489> don't

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
that's a that's a titanium ring I don't

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.279 
that's a that's a titanium ring I don't
know<00:04:14.549> if<00:04:14.640> you<00:04:14.700> can<00:04:14.820> hear<00:04:15.030> I'll<00:04:15.510> try<00:04:15.720> to<00:04:15.780> hold<00:04:16.140> it

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
know if you can hear I'll try to hold it

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.259 
know if you can hear I'll try to hold it
to<00:04:16.380> the<00:04:16.470> camera<00:04:16.820> so<00:04:17.820> you<00:04:17.880> can<00:04:17.970> hear<00:04:18.150> the

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
to the camera so you can hear the

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:24.310 
to the camera so you can hear the
vibration

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.690 

you<00:04:25.320> know<00:04:25.470> I'll<00:04:25.710> let<00:04:25.860> you<00:04:25.980> hear<00:04:26.130> the<00:04:26.220> beep<00:04:26.430> -

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
you know I'll let you hear the beep -

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:34.520 
you know I'll let you hear the beep -
this<00:04:27.570> is<00:04:27.630> the<00:04:28.220> box<00:04:33.080> and<00:04:34.080> probably<00:04:34.200> have<00:04:34.470> the

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
this is the box and probably have the

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.140 
this is the box and probably have the
vibration<00:04:35.010> off<00:04:35.130> of<00:04:35.280> the<00:04:35.870> ring<00:04:36.870> itself<00:04:38.150> light

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
vibration off of the ring itself light

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.510 
vibration off of the ring itself light
gets<00:04:39.390> brighter<00:04:39.650> and<00:04:40.650> the<00:04:40.800> little<00:04:41.010> motor<00:04:41.220> goes

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
gets brighter and the little motor goes

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:48.980 
gets brighter and the little motor goes
faster<00:04:44.750> so<00:04:47.270> we<00:04:48.270> see<00:04:48.420> if<00:04:48.480> I<00:04:48.570> can<00:04:48.660> get<00:04:48.750> down<00:04:48.960> here

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
faster so we see if I can get down here

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.990 
faster so we see if I can get down here
where<00:04:49.290> you<00:04:49.380> guys<00:04:49.530> are<00:04:52.280> I'm<00:04:53.280> sorry<00:04:53.490> this<00:04:53.760> looks

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
where you guys are I'm sorry this looks

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.570 
where you guys are I'm sorry this looks
like<00:04:54.150> crap<00:04:54.480> it's<00:04:55.200> partly<00:04:55.980> because<00:04:56.130> I<00:04:56.400> don't

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
like crap it's partly because I don't

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.920 
like crap it's partly because I don't
know<00:04:56.670> what<00:04:56.790> I'm<00:04:56.880> doing<00:04:57.120> with<00:04:57.180> this<00:04:57.300> camera<00:04:57.750> I

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
know what I'm doing with this camera I

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.980 
know what I'm doing with this camera I
can<00:04:58.860> figure<00:04:59.070> this<00:04:59.310> crap<00:04:59.370> out<00:04:59.850> but<00:05:00.510> the<00:05:00.630> camera

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
can figure this crap out but the camera

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.030
