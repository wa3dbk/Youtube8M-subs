cooperator<00:02:19.070> know<00:02:20.070> my<00:02:20.220> walk<00:02:20.520> so<00:02:20.910> even<00:02:21.150> if<00:02:21.240> it's

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
cooperator know my walk so even if it's

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.290 
cooperator know my walk so even if it's
got<00:02:21.600> you<00:02:22.080> know<00:02:22.110> a<00:02:22.230> pretty<00:02:22.560> chunky<00:02:22.770> case<00:02:23.340> which

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
got you know a pretty chunky case which

got you know a pretty chunky case which
this<00:02:24.690> one<00:02:24.750> makes<00:02:25.260> it<00:02:25.470> quite<00:02:25.740> a<00:02:25.800> bit<00:02:25.950> chunkier

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
this one makes it quite a bit chunkier

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.070 
this one makes it quite a bit chunkier
than<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:26.760> normal<00:02:27.030> ipod<00:02:28.130> it<00:02:29.130> was<00:02:29.310> still<00:02:29.520> thin
