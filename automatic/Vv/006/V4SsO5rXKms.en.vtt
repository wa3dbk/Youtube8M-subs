00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.850
 so it is eleven people who have accidents on or around seven days a year 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.249
 And then we have to push back 

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:12.519
 and then nice house attention 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:15.039
 and that is precisely the girls' team 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:19.810
 and then fully addressed if that number comes up like that 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:23.560
 then we will be the first to maintain it there 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.560
 of which deed 3 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.140
 start right away 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.489
 drunk 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:32.489

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:36.490
 the device 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.490
 he is rss 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.870
 both directors are addressed in this taken away 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.170
 the criminal case 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.260
 the eu countries 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.660
 nice though 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.000
 someone who knows what i want to underline the difference 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.960
 is always recorded 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.310
 ticket and 150 euros 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.260
 that is 150 euros 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.010
 actually as a statement at 713 euros the access level not shown 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.380
 we still have to see 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.000
 if you again have a reason why then the campground open nk distances 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.170
 after another busy period of interest 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.340
 41 ranking security of the euro remains 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.130
 for alcohol 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.090
 but we will not continue 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.500
 so go now or he should go to eatery he just needs to know for sure 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.230
 stops safely and that Netherlands to cross and that was not every case 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.700
 We will be fine again 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.930
 The acquisition was also suspected that he was still ahead 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.000
 The main character also becomes the bodies of the two drivers 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.380
 screened 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.380
 actually we can grab a win by writing our name 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.830
 brussels and leuven and brussels 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.059

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:18.089
 the current season 

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:20.029
 after an accident 

00:02:20.029 --> 00:02:23.029
 it is even on the night of Sunday when needed 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:28.589
 however, it is a pity but we are lost 

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:33.409
 he continued to spread 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:36.109
 71 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:39.109
 knowledge center, the situation is very serious 

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:45.479
 yes i can flow 

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:48.359
 they have a pair in which the overall mental plane is 0 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:50.259
 these amounts of lead 

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:53.959
 come come i find that the engine is no longer about living there right now that 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.069
 you know the location of that man 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:58.669

 at twente to the life I wait what is on the car yes that you thought so 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.549
 they had a different story 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.759
 yes it is dangerous and I have more groundwater 

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:15.759
 And with the resolution you can't see them names 

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:18.189
 therefore I think it is not possible 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:20.149
 went to Frankfurt 

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:23.149
 and in that sense I think he makes his courts 

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:26.059
 I find it a bit uncertain 

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:30.209

 in terms of euros 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:44.139

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:47.929
 in addition to web browser chrome 50 euros 

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:50.479
 one is to give an own weight 

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:51.779
 it's a waste 

00:03:51.779 --> 00:03:53.539
 9 

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:56.089

 now they will all be sure to do 

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:19.239
 according to official data 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.249
 there is a nice leap forward 

00:04:21.249 --> 00:04:23.249
 and there less trouble with an asx file 

00:04:23.249 --> 00:04:24.939
