00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:15.400
 Implementation of the VP 08 in the repair at 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:17.290
 alstom transport gmbh salzgitter ag becomes 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.910
 as stupid as reported in the entrance 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.880
 Customer order is in the sales area 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.740
 created in ERP system 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.990
 then the car entrance of the 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.199
 Work preparation reported the order 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.949
 is created in the mdc database 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.899
 then this will be the 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:35.260
 technical data of the wagon from the 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:37.510
 customer web portal as xml files examines the 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.790
 healing is now in appropriate mbc 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.250
 order and so are all 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.839
 relevant technical details before 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.850
 dare receptive known the 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:48.129
 Work preparation is now laying the 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:52.629
 mdc order his wagon on a 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:55.030
 tablet for each wagon will be barcode 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.949
 sticker printed this tablet with the 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.589
 offline to attach the data to 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.299
 control or update 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:03.400
 At the same time the car with the barcode 

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:07.350
 sticker and later one 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.350
 enable faster data entry 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.360
 after the recording is made 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.990
 work preparation with his tablet 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.700
 again 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.710
 The data will be in the database 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.300
 transferred and thus stand all 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.250
 immediately available 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.630
 after the safety-technical 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.760
 check resp 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.020
 cleaning the car in the workshop 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.810
 to carry out the required 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.670
 Work will be ranked according to 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.890
 have to do the work to be done 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.950
 werker the possibility of certain work 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.830
 selecting profiles here was the stock 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.400
 is an en de data acquisition device 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.080
 loaded 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.390
 then the werker can 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.869
 data acquisition in the offline mode on the carriage 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.240
 in front 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.369
 the example of the high name scans the 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.930
 werker with the mde device first the 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.250
 Car number around the relevant 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.470
 to start data acquisition 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.479
 based on the vp compliant 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.820
 he has the possibility the selection lists 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:01.360
 clearly identifiable components 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.460
 even this until 10 of vp 08 unique 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.500
 and identical writing of the data 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.670
 The construction is lifted bogies 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.780
 rolled out the wheelsets everyone thought up 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.420
 Work step requires a certain amount 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.280
 data input so becomes when expanding the 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.239
 wheelsets the actual extension 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.239
 also firm 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.150
 bogies receive their refurbishment 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.910
 here are also from the werker the 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.610
 data entered directly into the device 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.130
 Mde devices will end at shift 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.330
 Covered up again the data will be in 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.730
 transfer the database 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.880
 the wheel sets pass through to the 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.070
 refurbishment in the wheelset workshop 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.840
 almost the same happens here 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:45.050
 wheelset is provided with a barcode 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.120
 the wheelset only plays again 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.610
 every station is tired of the workers 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.500
 Devices available on the relevant 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.500
 technical data of sales from the 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.660
 mdc database were loaded 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.340
 offline mode will be depending on the workbench 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.680
 his dream as a profile the technical 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.630
 data in mde device determined by 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.890
 scanning the barcode will be the right one 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.890
 set of wheels selected 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.960
 on the machines like wheelset lathe 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.300
 or ultrasound test bench will be the 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.650
 measured data automatically into the mbc 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.870
 database read 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.620
 the wheelset is also here based on the 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.620
 barcodes identified 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.030
 after the wheelset all stations 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.870
 he will go under one 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.090
 wagon installed 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:41.330
 This is also done as installation 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.250
 message in the mbc database we come 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.840
 again the barcodes of the wagon to 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.490
 Recognition of the corresponding order 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.520
 and the barcodes of the wheelsets to 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.850
 Use will come with your device 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.850
 posed 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.819
 after the tree has been set up is 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.509
 the required brands examination 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:22.389
 carried out 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:24.639
 the worksman has his work in advance again 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:27.370
 borat loaded on his device 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:29.259
 He selects his work profile from scans 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.970
 the barcode and carries in offline mode 

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:33.580
 the necessary data 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.879
 after checking the database are a 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.289
 Transfer double bed to the database 

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:39.909
 production of photos in this 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:41.740
 wise possible and can in 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:43.750
 corresponding record on element 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.520
 level deposited it goes 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.470
 also for the most diverse 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.550
 Documents 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.610
 Finally, the car receives one 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.620
 quality control quality staff 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.370
 we use the data here at tablets 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.530
 to control 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.150
 after acceptance, the go 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.729
 employee with the tablets by the 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.759
 log into the online world the data 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:04.930
 Local are available online 

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:06.969
 The last step will be the 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:10.000
 exported technical data 

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:12.550
 and as xml file respective customer 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.039
 Law all necessary documents like 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.500
 operation release or wheelset installation 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:19.719
 can expand directly from the mbc 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.620
 Database printed and sent to the customer 

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:23.590
 to be shipped 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.060
 a big step for everyone in a new one 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:27.840
 future of the electronic 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.840
 data transmission
