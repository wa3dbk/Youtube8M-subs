00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.520 
especially the night vision which is
something<00:03:36.210> I<00:03:36.540> think<00:03:36.750> would<00:03:36.840> be<00:03:36.960> really<00:03:37.170> really

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
something I think would be really really

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.340 
something I think would be really really
cool<00:03:37.980> and<00:03:38.250> they<00:03:39.060> are<00:03:39.120> also<00:03:39.300> bringing<00:03:40.230> in

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
cool and they are also bringing in

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.720 
cool and they are also bringing in
emeralds<00:03:40.860> which<00:03:41.010> was<00:03:41.220> seen<00:03:41.460> in<00:03:41.700> the

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
emeralds which was seen in the

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.030 
emeralds which was seen in the
screenshots<00:03:42.540> and<00:03:42.780> now<00:03:43.290> because<00:03:43.590> emeralds<00:03:43.980> are

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
screenshots and now because emeralds are

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.830 
screenshots and now because emeralds are
actually<00:03:44.340> from<00:03:44.460> the<00:03:44.580> 1.4<00:03:45.210> version<00:03:45.690> not<00:03:45.810> the

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
actually from the 1.4 version not the

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.960 
actually from the 1.4 version not the
one<00:03:46.230> point<00:03:46.440> 3.1<00:03:47.010> version<00:03:47.040> which<00:03:47.610> is<00:03:47.640> what

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
one point 3.1 version which is what

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.870 
one point 3.1 version which is what
minecraft<00:03:48.960> tu14<00:03:49.770> is<00:03:50.040> going<00:03:50.190> to<00:03:50.250> be<00:03:50.310> based<00:03:50.580> off

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
minecraft tu14 is going to be based off

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.610 
minecraft tu14 is going to be based off
I<00:03:51.090> think<00:03:51.630> they<00:03:51.750> will<00:03:51.900> be<00:03:52.020> bringing<00:03:52.200> some<00:03:52.320> stuff

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
I think they will be bringing some stuff

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.590 
I think they will be bringing some stuff
forward<00:03:53.250> so<00:03:53.730> something<00:03:54.150> that<00:03:54.270> I<00:03:54.360> I'm

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
forward so something that I I'm

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.270 
forward so something that I I'm
definitely<00:03:54.930> thinking<00:03:55.260> they<00:03:55.710> could<00:03:56.100> be<00:03:56.250> a

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
definitely thinking they could be a

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.850 
definitely thinking they could be a
possibility<00:03:56.790> is<00:03:57.180> a<00:03:57.260> beacon<00:03:58.260> blocks<00:03:58.560> because

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
possibility is a beacon blocks because

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.380 
possibility is a beacon blocks because
beacon<00:03:59.280> blocks<00:03:59.490> came<00:03:59.730> out<00:03:59.880> the<00:04:00.030> very<00:04:00.210> same

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
beacon blocks came out the very same

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.990 
beacon blocks came out the very same
time<00:04:00.630> as<00:04:00.870> emeralds<00:04:01.320> on<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.680> pc<00:04:02.070> version<00:04:02.100> which

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
time as emeralds on the pc version which

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.940 
time as emeralds on the pc version which
was<00:04:03.030> on<00:04:03.450> minecraft<00:04:04.880> 1.4<00:04:05.880> point<00:04:06.150> 1<00:04:06.740> so<00:04:07.740> I'm

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
was on minecraft 1.4 point 1 so I'm

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.730 
was on minecraft 1.4 point 1 so I'm
hoping<00:04:08.430> we<00:04:08.970> will<00:04:09.180> begin<00:04:09.450> in<00:04:09.720> something<00:04:10.140> like

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:10.740 
hoping we will begin in something like

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.770 
hoping we will begin in something like
that<00:04:11.010> I<00:04:11.040> mean<00:04:11.280> beacon<00:04:11.880> blocks<00:04:12.120> are<00:04:12.330> really

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
that I mean beacon blocks are really

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.260 
that I mean beacon blocks are really
really<00:04:12.990> cooler<00:04:13.470> absolutely<00:04:14.100> amazing<00:04:14.550> I<00:04:14.700> think

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
really cooler absolutely amazing I think

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.570 
really cooler absolutely amazing I think
they're<00:04:15.450> they're<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:16.500> kind<00:04:17.130> of<00:04:17.190> practical

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
they're they're the kind of practical

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.760 
they're they're the kind of practical
implications<00:04:18.450> for<00:04:18.630> them<00:04:18.750> into<00:04:19.109> adventure

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:19.770 
implications for them into adventure

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.250 
implications for them into adventure
maps<00:04:20.190> alone<00:04:20.760> would<00:04:21.239> be<00:04:21.330> amazing<00:04:21.870> and<00:04:22.049> they<00:04:22.140> are

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
maps alone would be amazing and they are

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.230 
maps alone would be amazing and they are
cool<00:04:22.530> thing<00:04:22.770> to<00:04:22.800> have<00:04:22.890> in<00:04:23.100> your<00:04:23.130> own<00:04:23.340> world<00:04:23.610> so

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
cool thing to have in your own world so

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.520 
cool thing to have in your own world so
hopefully<00:04:24.810> they<00:04:24.960> will<00:04:25.140> be<00:04:25.290> bringing

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
hopefully they will be bringing

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.620 
hopefully they will be bringing
something<00:04:25.890> like<00:04:26.160> that<00:04:26.340> so<00:04:26.850> that's<00:04:27.210> really

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
something like that so that's really

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.330 
something like that so that's really

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.620 
think that minecraft next generation and
minecraft<00:04:39.510> tu14<00:04:40.080> will<00:04:40.560> be<00:04:40.770> released<00:04:41.300> I'm<00:04:42.300> not

minecraft tu14 will be released I'm not
dead<00:04:43.050> certain<00:04:43.500> on<00:04:43.620> that<00:04:43.650> but<00:04:44.190> I<00:04:44.430> would<00:04:45.210> nearly

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
dead certain on that but I would nearly

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.660 
dead certain on that but I would nearly

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:47.670 
bet my money that that is when we should

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.820 
bet my money that that is when we should
be<00:04:48.000> expecting<00:04:48.210> it<00:04:48.840> I'm<00:04:48.990> able<00:04:49.140> to<00:04:49.350> screenshot
