00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.869
 as it's called good because if not for the 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.669
 Project moment is for project park

 everything and nothing else they only showed 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.120
 it's a small trailer and nothing else so 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.300
 we go to the next topic because there is no 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.969
 nothing more to say now of 3 2014 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.329
 assassin's creed juniti was confirmed 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.820
 also that it has operational mode if 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.789
 a new way to entertain people 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.550
 it was the cooperative mode and the people of is 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.309
 well script was not left behind and showed in 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.789
 the e3 in the microsoft conference 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.260
 obviously that you can play in mode 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.100
 cooperative in 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:11.640
 assassin's creed juniti what yes 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.510
 confirmed also is that this written 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.510
 will happen in the French Revolution 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:21.390
 will happen in the French Revolution 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.180
 which is fine I do not know is cool and 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.560
 one of the most things that is reported 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.560
 out there the first thing that jova 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.909
 comparative that we know how many of 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.780
 four players online 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.780
 of 4 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.920
 it was also confirmed that they are 49 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.100
 9 studios are working on that 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.680
 written and unity 29 studies 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.730
 and this secretion and I repeat it is going to 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.810
 go out for playstation 4 xbox one and pc 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.810
 open world game 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:02.600
 and the question is the people of play 3 and 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:04.189
 xbox 360 would like to have this game 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.810
 most likely it seems that yes 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:07.670
 but is that that game is made I'm not going 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.069
 to run very well on consoles and 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.840
 old not from old generation but let's go 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.060
 to see what happens when it comes out there's still no 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.350
 exact date but it was already shown that 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.390
 implies more so that end of the year 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.970
 it's most likely no more because that it 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.120
 Make year - end but the co - op 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:26.420
 be very cool that yes it will be very 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.060
 cool finally came an assassin's creed 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.680
 cooperative and hopefully convert in 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.290
 action to trash 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.079
 can be entertaining maybe like a 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.980
 gresini bolt maybe but let's see 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:41.450
 now two murderers maybe this afternoon more 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.370
 but there are seasons to celebrate because it 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.170
 comes with all people I say goodbye I went 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.209
