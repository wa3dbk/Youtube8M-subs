made me a really fun deck at Nationals
and<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.500> was<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.740> thought<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:52.979> was<00:01:53.070> a

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
and it was I thought it was a

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.560 
and it was I thought it was a
competitive<00:01:53.399> deck<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:53.759> mean<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.299> didn't

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
competitive deck I mean it and I didn't

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.240 
competitive deck I mean it and I didn't
I<00:01:54.810> think<00:01:55.259> if<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.409> had<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.649> had<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.890> skill<00:01:56.219> of

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
I think if I had to had the skill of

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.709 
I think if I had to had the skill of
someone<00:01:56.729> who<00:01:56.790> plays<00:01:56.939> all<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.240> time<00:01:57.299> like<00:01:57.600> I

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
someone who plays all the time like I

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:58.969 
someone who plays all the time like I
used<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:57.990> do<00:01:58.140> back<00:01:58.290> in<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.439> day<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.649> think<00:01:58.799> it

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
used to do back in the day I think it

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.649 
used to do back in the day I think it
could<00:01:59.100> have<00:01:59.189> done<00:01:59.310> very<00:01:59.520> well<00:01:59.640> actually<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.360> got

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
could have done very well actually I got

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.450 
could have done very well actually I got
40th<00:02:01.049> which<00:02:01.200> was<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:01.619> bad<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:01.979> got<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.280> match

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
40th which was so bad and I got to match

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.249 
40th which was so bad and I got to match

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
know they're fun and they're they have a

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.499 
know they're fun and they're they have a
shot<00:02:08.489> at<00:02:08.640> being<00:02:08.670> competitive<00:02:09.060> but<00:02:09.390> they're

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
shot at being competitive but they're

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.790 
shot at being competitive but they're
just<00:02:09.599> something<00:02:09.810> that's<00:02:10.170> not<00:02:10.349> normal<00:02:10.709> which

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
just something that's not normal which

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.930 
just something that's not normal which
is<00:02:10.830> cool<00:02:11.129> because<00:02:11.220> it's<00:02:11.489> hard<00:02:11.640> for<00:02:11.730> people<00:02:11.760> to

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
is cool because it's hard for people to

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.890 
is cool because it's hard for people to
prepare<00:02:12.270> for

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
prepare for

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.149

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:14.159 
and I really don't want to just sit here

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:15.410

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
it off I really I think I have a good

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.399 
it off I really I think I have a good
shot<00:02:28.530> at<00:02:28.739> it<00:02:28.890> if<00:02:29.310> things<00:02:29.819> don't<00:02:29.970> go<00:02:30.239> I<00:02:30.269> mean<00:02:30.510> the

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409 
shot at it if things don't go I mean the

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:32.869 
shot at it if things don't go I mean the
law<00:02:31.620> of<00:02:31.650> averages<00:02:32.040> is<00:02:32.189> I'm<00:02:32.340> lucky<00:02:32.549> I<00:02:32.579> got<00:02:32.790> the

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
law of averages is I'm lucky I got the

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.039 
law of averages is I'm lucky I got the
other<00:02:32.970> rounds<00:02:33.299> it<00:02:33.390> should<00:02:33.510> average<00:02:33.629> out<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.019> I

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
other rounds it should average out and I

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:35.300 
other rounds it should average out and I
should<00:02:34.200> get<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.319> little<00:02:34.439> lucky<00:02:34.650> these<00:02:34.890> rounds

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
should get a little lucky these rounds
