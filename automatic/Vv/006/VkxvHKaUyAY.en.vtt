 The tips of one video from another have a 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.700
 very little speed is gained the cpc is so 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.270

 here is going to attack it will become simpler the 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.590
 your computer but it will have a gain 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.019
 very large it greatly increases the 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:37.360
 performance is that it can close 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:39.459

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.880

 You can select it here with nine this 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.760
 box system configuration you come 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:58.530
 here at services down here to hide 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.100
 all microsoft services in 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:05.790
 select this box and here 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.440
 are all programs and sometimes they 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.990
 are working 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.880
 yesterday several running here I do not 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:15.000
 I'm using the truth, I'm not using 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:18.240
 it's running like mine. 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.850
 antivirus it is from microsoft so it does not 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.520
 would need to leave him none selected 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.290

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.320
 leaving only your selected 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.720
 antivirus to never disable money 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:34.440
 This can disable all of this here. 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:37.020
 also makes this run very slowly if 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:41.790
 you have everything selected after that 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:44.160
