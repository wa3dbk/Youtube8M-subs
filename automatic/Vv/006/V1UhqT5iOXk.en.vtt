00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
back you take the back panel off let's

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.089 
back you take the back panel off let's
pull<00:00:23.939> that<00:00:23.970> off<00:00:24.240> if<00:00:24.930> you<00:00:25.019> take<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.380> back<00:00:25.590> panel

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
pull that off if you take the back panel

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.400 
pull that off if you take the back panel
off<00:00:26.220> you<00:00:26.430> can<00:00:26.580> see<00:00:26.849> maybe<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:27.900> can<00:00:28.050> see<00:00:28.230> but

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
off you can see maybe you can see but

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.840 
off you can see maybe you can see but
there<00:00:28.529> is<00:00:28.650> an<00:00:28.769> SD<00:00:29.010> card<00:00:30.320> over<00:00:31.320> here<00:00:31.640> you<00:00:32.640> see

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
there is an SD card over here you see

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.229 
there is an SD card over here you see
that<00:00:33.030> maybe<00:00:33.660> not<00:00:33.930> way<00:00:34.739> way<00:00:34.980> it's<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.489> went<00:00:35.940> cut<00:00:36.210> a

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
that maybe not way way it's I went cut a

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.510 
that maybe not way way it's I went cut a
little<00:00:36.450> notch<00:00:36.540> out<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.350> can<00:00:37.530> see<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:37.800> right

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
little notch out you can see it right

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.240 
little notch out you can see it right
there<00:00:38.550> it's<00:00:39.090> up<00:00:39.300> it's<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.989> 4<00:00:40.230> gigabyte<00:00:40.590> SD<00:00:40.770> card

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
there it's up it's a 4 gigabyte SD card

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.299 
there it's up it's a 4 gigabyte SD card
so<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:41.940> actually<00:00:42.450> went<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.200> cut<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.739> notch<00:00:43.980> out

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
so I actually went and cut a notch out

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.720 
so I actually went and cut a notch out
right<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.239> plastic<00:00:45.629> with<00:00:45.719> my<00:00:45.840> dremel<00:00:46.289> oh<00:00:46.730> well

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
right the plastic with my dremel oh well

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.299 
right the plastic with my dremel oh well
there<00:00:48.030> goes<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.239> warranty<00:00:48.960> but<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:49.890> wanted<00:00:50.250> to

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
there goes the warranty but I wanted to

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.670 
there goes the warranty but I wanted to
see<00:00:50.550> what<00:00:51.390> we<00:00:51.539> could<00:00:51.690> do<00:00:51.899> with<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.110> SD<00:00:52.469> card

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
see what we could do with that SD card

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.340 
see what we could do with that SD card
so<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:52.829> pulled<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.190> out<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.850> obviously<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.660> sits

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
so I pulled it out and obviously it sits

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.740 
so I pulled it out and obviously it sits
in<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.980> machine<00:00:56.280> right<00:00:56.489> now<00:00:56.520> but<00:00:57.420> when<00:00:57.660> you

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
in the machine right now but when you

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.180 
in the machine right now but when you
open<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.199> up<00:00:59.059> you<00:01:00.059> might<00:01:00.270> be<00:01:00.359> able<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.510> see<00:01:00.660> this

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
open it up you might be able to see this

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.380 
open it up you might be able to see this
this<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.399> what<00:01:02.579> comes<00:01:02.760> up<00:01:03.030> on<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.420> um<00:01:05.390> it's

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
this is what comes up on it um it's

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.080 
this is what comes up on it um it's
really<00:01:06.689> interesting<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:08.549> actually<00:01:08.790> has

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
really interesting it it actually has

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.969 
really interesting it it actually has
some<00:01:09.360> dat<00:01:09.750> files<00:01:10.970> and<00:01:11.970> then<00:01:12.659> offline<00:01:13.439> printing

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
some dat files and then offline printing

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.440 
some dat files and then offline printing
and<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.610> guess<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.750> offline<00:01:16.350> printing<00:01:16.830> one<00:01:17.450> I

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
and I guess the offline printing one I

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.510 
and I guess the offline printing one I
don't<00:01:19.110> know<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.350> don't<00:01:19.560> know<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.920> one<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.159> but

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
don't know I don't know that one is but

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.179 
don't know I don't know that one is but
uh<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:21.240> anyway<00:01:21.540> what<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.140> did<00:01:22.530> was<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:23.009> actually

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
uh so anyway what I did was I actually

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.940 
uh so anyway what I did was I actually
went<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.930> open<00:01:24.930> one<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.170> these<00:01:25.259> up<00:01:25.320> so<00:01:25.770> let's

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
went and open one of these up so let's

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.780 
went and open one of these up so let's
say<00:01:26.070> let's<00:01:26.310> just<00:01:26.340> open<00:01:26.640> up<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.820> sample<00:01:27.680> file<00:01:28.790> and

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
say let's just open up a sample file and

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.179 
say let's just open up a sample file and
it's<00:01:30.420> really<00:01:30.570> interesting<00:01:30.780> but<00:01:31.079> it's<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.439> it's

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
it's really interesting but it's a it's

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.590 
it's really interesting but it's a it's
a<00:01:32.880> g-code<00:01:33.570> file<00:01:33.810> it's<00:01:34.560> not<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:36.119> know<00:01:36.150> their

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
a g-code file it's not a you know their

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.429 
a g-code file it's not a you know their
proprietary<00:01:37.460> dot<00:01:38.460> where's<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.380> you<00:01:40.380> know

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
proprietary dot where's that you know

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.999 
proprietary dot where's that you know
they<00:01:40.590> have<00:01:40.680> their<00:01:40.770> own<00:01:41.040> proprietary<00:01:42.829> you<00:01:43.829> know

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
they have their own proprietary you know

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.280 
they have their own proprietary you know
dot<00:01:44.579> three<00:01:45.000> 3w<00:01:45.750> or<00:01:45.840> whatever<00:01:46.049> this<00:01:46.200> is

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
dot three 3w or whatever this is

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.899 
dot three 3w or whatever this is
actually<00:01:46.560> G<00:01:46.710> Co<00:01:46.860> file<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:47.250> this<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.460> on<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.610> SD

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
actually G Co file so this is on the SD

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.850 
actually G Co file so this is on the SD
card<00:01:47.939> so<00:01:48.780> when<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.110> open<00:01:49.140> one<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:49.710> these<00:01:49.799> up

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
card so when you open one of these up

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.190 
card so when you open one of these up
let's<00:01:50.399> just<00:01:50.490> open<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:50.909> up<00:01:51.090> oh<00:01:52.220> look<00:01:53.220> at<00:01:53.399> that

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
let's just open it up oh look at that

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.950 
let's just open it up oh look at that
that<00:01:55.200> looks<00:01:56.189> very<00:01:56.670> similar<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.420> standard<00:01:57.689> G

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
that looks very similar to standard G

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.170 
that looks very similar to standard G
cut<00:01:58.140> so<00:01:58.320> here<00:01:58.469> let's<00:01:58.649> scroll<00:01:58.829> down<00:01:58.890> but<00:01:59.399> you

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
cut so here let's scroll down but you

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.929 
cut so here let's scroll down but you
know<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.630> has<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.170> set<00:02:02.040> temperature<00:02:02.250> waiting

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
know it has the set temperature waiting

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.930 
know it has the set temperature waiting
for<00:02:03.030> temperature<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.630> be<00:02:03.719> reached

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
for temperature to be reached

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.170 
for temperature to be reached
it<00:02:06.000> goes<00:02:06.210> into<00:02:06.510> the<00:02:07.340> you<00:02:08.340> know<00:02:08.490> use<00:02:08.729> absolute

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:09.180 
it goes into the you know use absolute

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.160 
it goes into the you know use absolute
distance<00:02:09.330> for<00:02:09.570> extruder

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
distance for extruder

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.210 
distance for extruder
I<00:02:10.320> mean<00:02:11.120> identical<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.890> standard<00:02:13.890> one<00:02:14.040> so

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
I mean identical to a standard one so

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.270 
I mean identical to a standard one so
let<00:02:14.340> me<00:02:14.460> uh<00:02:14.490> so<00:02:15.390> here's<00:02:15.690> one<00:02:16.050> so<00:02:16.560> that<00:02:16.740> this<00:02:16.920> so

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
let me uh so here's one so that this so

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.880 
let me uh so here's one so that this so
what<00:02:17.550> I<00:02:17.580> did<00:02:17.900> was<00:02:18.900> I<00:02:19.020> went<00:02:19.320> into<00:02:20.600> my<00:02:21.890> slicer

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
what I did was I went into my slicer

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.770 
what I did was I went into my slicer
this<00:02:23.070> is<00:02:23.250> an<00:02:23.370> older<00:02:23.610> version<00:02:23.790> but<00:02:24.390> this<00:02:24.600> is

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
this is an older version but this is

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.520 
this is an older version but this is
slicer<00:02:25.200> ten<00:02:26.010> point<00:02:26.280> Oh<00:02:27.170> change<00:02:28.170> some<00:02:28.410> of<00:02:28.440> my

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
slicer ten point Oh change some of my

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.230 
slicer ten point Oh change some of my
default<00:02:28.980> settings<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:30.620> then<00:02:31.850> sent<00:02:32.850> it<00:02:32.970> to

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
default settings and and then sent it to

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.040 
default settings and and then sent it to
be<00:02:33.330> a<00:02:33.360> g-code<00:02:33.780> file<00:02:34.820> so<00:02:35.820> then<00:02:36.060> with<00:02:36.900> that

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
be a g-code file so then with that

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:43.250 
be a g-code file so then with that
g-code<00:02:37.470> file<00:02:41.390> with<00:02:42.390> a<00:02:42.420> gqo<00:02:42.870> file

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
g-code file with a gqo file

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.770 
g-code file with a gqo file
I<00:02:43.350> made<00:02:43.560> this<00:02:43.860> twisted<00:02:44.430> bottle<00:02:44.760> boy<00:02:45.750> I

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
I made this twisted bottle boy I

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.150 
I made this twisted bottle boy I
determined<00:02:46.530> was<00:02:46.650> when<00:02:46.800> you<00:02:46.860> go<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.040> the

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
determined was when you go to the

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.280 
determined was when you go to the
machine<00:02:47.460> you<00:02:47.610> go<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.790> a<00:02:47.850> sample<00:02:48.150> section<00:02:48.480> the

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
machine you go to a sample section the

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.980 
machine you go to a sample section the
samples<00:02:49.770> like<00:02:49.950> call<00:02:50.280> out<00:02:50.460> star<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.360> face<00:02:51.600> and

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
samples like call out star and face and

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.790 
samples like call out star and face and
sample<00:02:52.380> one<00:02:52.590> or<00:02:52.920> star<00:02:53.400> face<00:02:53.670> and<00:02:54.200> XYZ<00:02:55.200> sample

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
sample one or star face and XYZ sample

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.360 
sample one or star face and XYZ sample
or<00:02:55.860> something

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
or something

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.170 
or something
so<00:02:56.850> I<00:02:56.880> actually<00:02:57.260> got<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.950> sample<00:02:59.550> three<00:02:59.880> and

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
so I actually got the sample three and

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.870 
so I actually got the sample three and
change<00:03:00.480> it<00:03:00.660> to<00:03:00.690> or<00:03:01.560> actually<00:03:01.920> got<00:03:02.520> sample

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
change it to or actually got sample

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.580 
change it to or actually got sample
three<00:03:03.120> and<00:03:03.270> change<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.720> name<00:03:03.930> to<00:03:04.170> twist<00:03:04.440> the

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
three and change the name to twist the

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.180 
three and change the name to twist the
third<00:03:05.010> got<00:03:05.820> sample<00:03:06.270> three<00:03:06.570> or<00:03:07.560> got<00:03:07.830> my<00:03:07.950> twist

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
third got sample three or got my twist

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.130 
third got sample three or got my twist
the<00:03:08.280> bottle<00:03:08.550> change<00:03:08.880> it<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.210> sample<00:03:09.600> three<00:03:09.930> and

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
the bottle change it to sample three and

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.590 
the bottle change it to sample three and
then<00:03:11.010> um<00:03:11.900> just<00:03:12.900> as<00:03:12.989> easy<00:03:13.790> now<00:03:14.790> we<00:03:14.850> are<00:03:15.420> actually

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
then um just as easy now we are actually

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:22.130 
then um just as easy now we are actually
running<00:03:16.110> a<00:03:17.840> slicer<00:03:19.130> program<00:03:20.130> on<00:03:20.600> a<00:03:21.600> DaVinci

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
running a slicer program on a DaVinci

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.479 
running a slicer program on a DaVinci
machine<00:03:22.440> so<00:03:22.800> it's<00:03:22.920> actually<00:03:23.070> running<00:03:23.340> the

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
machine so it's actually running the

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.130 
machine so it's actually running the
g-code<00:03:23.790> file<00:03:24.030> so<00:03:24.450> here's<00:03:24.630> what's<00:03:24.780> crazy<00:03:24.900> is

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
g-code file so here's what's crazy is

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.590 
g-code file so here's what's crazy is
that<00:03:25.290> I<00:03:25.350> change<00:03:25.920> the<00:03:26.010> filament<00:03:26.430> length<00:03:26.640> to

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
that I change the filament length to

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.140 
that I change the filament length to
like<00:03:27.780> one<00:03:28.080> meter<00:03:28.410> um<00:03:29.280> so<00:03:29.520> it<00:03:29.610> says<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.880> build

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
like one meter um so it says the build

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.690 
like one meter um so it says the build
time<00:03:30.390> is<00:03:30.630> are<00:03:30.750> 100%<00:03:31.110> done<00:03:31.500> time<00:03:32.310> elapsed

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
time is are 100% done time elapsed

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.970 
time is are 100% done time elapsed
that's<00:03:33.420> made<00:03:33.660> time<00:03:33.930> remaining<00:03:34.470> I<00:03:34.590> you<00:03:34.650> know<00:03:34.920> I

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
that's made time remaining I you know I

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.020 
that's made time remaining I you know I
don't<00:03:35.070> know<00:03:35.250> how<00:03:35.370> they<00:03:35.489> get<00:03:35.610> these<00:03:35.700> numbers

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
don't know how they get these numbers

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.120 
don't know how they get these numbers
now<00:03:36.060> but<00:03:36.450> it's<00:03:37.080> really<00:03:37.380> interesting<00:03:37.739> but

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
now but it's really interesting but

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.990 
now but it's really interesting but
we'll<00:03:38.400> come<00:03:38.610> on<00:03:38.730> in<00:03:38.880> here<00:03:39.180> and<00:03:40.519> see<00:03:41.519> what<00:03:41.850> we're

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
we'll come on in here and see what we're

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.470 
we'll come on in here and see what we're
doing<00:03:42.860> I<00:03:43.860> think<00:03:44.640> we<00:03:44.880> might<00:03:45.090> have<00:03:45.150> to<00:03:45.239> change

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
doing I think we might have to change

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.850 
doing I think we might have to change
some<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:45.810> height<00:03:46.019> values

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
some the height values

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.450 
some the height values
on<00:03:48.040> this<00:03:48.400> on<00:03:48.910> this<00:03:49.090> machine<00:03:49.270> but<00:03:50.100> yeah<00:03:51.100> those

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:51.460 
on this on this machine but yeah those

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.430 
on this on this machine but yeah those
look<00:03:51.640> like<00:03:51.820> really<00:03:52.360> good<00:03:52.780> prints<00:03:53.110> better<00:03:53.290> than

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
look like really good prints better than

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.270 
look like really good prints better than
where<00:03:53.560> I've<00:03:53.650> been<00:03:53.770> getting<00:03:54.040> out<00:03:54.130> of<00:03:54.220> the

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
where I've been getting out of the

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.130 
where I've been getting out of the
DaVinci<00:03:54.610> machine<00:03:54.880> so<00:03:55.150> I'm<00:03:55.750> gonna<00:03:55.900> let<00:03:56.020> this

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
DaVinci machine so I'm gonna let this

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.090 
DaVinci machine so I'm gonna let this
keep<00:03:56.320> on<00:03:56.500> running<00:03:57.000> but<00:03:58.000> hackers<00:03:58.690> unite<00:03:59.350> and

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
keep on running but hackers unite and

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.790 
keep on running but hackers unite and
let's<00:04:00.700> see<00:04:00.910> what<00:04:01.060> we<00:04:01.150> could<00:04:01.300> do<00:04:01.510> about<00:04:01.800> getting

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.800 
let's see what we could do about getting

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.120 
let's see what we could do about getting
in<00:04:02.890> that<00:04:03.040> back<00:04:03.250> to<00:04:03.490> work<00:04:03.640> through<00:04:04.060> the<00:04:04.180> SD<00:04:04.480> card

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
in that back to work through the SD card

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.550 
in that back to work through the SD card
and<00:04:06.130> starting<00:04:06.880> load<00:04:07.060> files<00:04:07.330> onto<00:04:07.750> it<00:04:07.870> so<00:04:08.080> we

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
and starting load files onto it so we

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.620 
and starting load files onto it so we
might<00:04:08.800> not<00:04:08.980> even<00:04:09.190> have<00:04:09.490> to<00:04:09.730> worry<00:04:10.720> about<00:04:11.130> the

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
might not even have to worry about the

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.210 
might not even have to worry about the
DaVinci<00:04:13.630> or<00:04:13.750> that's<00:04:13.960> why<00:04:14.170> see<00:04:14.440> where<00:04:14.680> we<00:04:15.070> can

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
DaVinci or that's why see where we can

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.690 
DaVinci or that's why see where we can
just<00:04:15.430> run<00:04:16.150> slicer<00:04:17.040> do<00:04:18.040> a<00:04:18.070> little<00:04:18.370> bit<00:04:18.489> of<00:04:18.549> hand

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700
