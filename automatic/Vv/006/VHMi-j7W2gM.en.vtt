00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.910
The Peterborough Patriots
versus the Charlestown Chiefs,

00:00:08.035 --> 00:00:10.747
brought to you by
Sheehan's Rustproofing.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.749
The Chiefs have come out
on the ice for a warm-up period.

00:00:13.833 --> 00:00:16.710
They're about to try
for their fifth consecutive win.

00:00:16.793 --> 00:00:19.088
They're applauded by their booster club,

00:00:19.171 --> 00:00:23.467
who have travelled all the way
from Charlestown to be here tonight.

00:00:56.873 --> 00:01:00.294
There's no one to stop it because
there are no officials on the ice.

00:01:00.377 --> 00:01:03.880
What has come over
the Charlestown Chiefs?

00:01:11.471 --> 00:01:15.767
And the rockets' red glare

00:01:15.892 --> 00:01:20.188
The bombs bursting in air

00:01:20.313 --> 00:01:25.193
Gave proof through the night

00:01:25.318 --> 00:01:30.280
That our flag was still there

00:01:30.949 --> 00:01:33.409
I got my eye on you.
You pull one thing, you're out.

00:01:33.492 --> 00:01:36.036
I run a clean game.
Any trouble, I'll suspend you.

00:01:36.161 --> 00:01:38.288
I'm listening to the fucking song!

00:01:42.501 --> 00:01:48.757
O'er the land of the free
