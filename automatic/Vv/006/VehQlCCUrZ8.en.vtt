00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
at the ball quite skylight and I think

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.560 
at the ball quite skylight and I think
this<00:01:18.470> is<00:01:18.710> room<00:01:19.010> wine<00:01:19.250> but<00:01:19.760> I'm<00:01:19.940> not<00:01:20.090> sure

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
this is room wine but I'm not sure

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.140 
this is room wine but I'm not sure
anyways<00:01:21.500> let's<00:01:22.310> turn<00:01:22.610> the<00:01:22.760> cup<00:01:22.940> on<00:01:23.620> and<00:01:25.150> let's

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
anyways let's turn the cup on and let's

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:36.149 
anyways let's turn the cup on and let's
start<00:01:26.540> get<00:01:27.260> to<00:01:27.440> eat<00:01:28.400> or<00:01:29.229> props<00:01:30.229> yeah<00:01:33.909> okay<00:01:34.909> so

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
start get to eat or props yeah okay so

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.910 
start get to eat or props yeah okay so
here

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.790 

and<00:01:42.150> that's<00:01:43.150> that<00:01:43.450> so<00:01:43.720> this<00:01:44.170> is<00:01:44.380> basically<00:01:44.710> a

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
and that's that so this is basically a

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.540 
and that's that so this is basically a
machine<00:01:45.580> and<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:47.170> guess<00:01:47.380> you<00:01:47.560> should<00:01:47.770> go<00:01:47.980> behind

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
machine and I guess you should go behind

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.660 
machine and I guess you should go behind
the<00:01:48.910> scenes<00:01:49.240> now<00:01:51.840> so<00:01:52.840> I<00:01:53.140> have<00:01:53.560> a<00:01:53.860> clock<00:01:54.310> here

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
the scenes now so I have a clock here

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.870 
the scenes now so I have a clock here
it's<00:01:55.480> a<00:01:55.750> one<00:01:55.990> tick<00:01:56.290> box<00:01:56.620> it's<00:01:56.860> a<00:01:57.040> very<00:01:57.460> fast

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
it's a one tick box it's a very fast

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.990 
it's a one tick box it's a very fast
ball<00:01:58.150> and<00:01:59.010> basically<00:02:00.010> it<00:02:00.310> connects<00:02:00.700> to<00:02:00.910> the

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
ball and basically it connects to the

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.310 
ball and basically it connects to the
dispensers<00:02:01.720> here<00:02:02.140> and<00:02:02.880> on<00:02:03.960> Fushigi<00:02:04.960> way<00:02:05.080> it

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
dispensers here and on Fushigi way it

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.070 
dispensers here and on Fushigi way it
connects<00:02:05.830> to<00:02:05.950> the<00:02:06.220> slam

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
connects to the slam

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.840 
connects to the slam
so<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.320> dispenser<00:02:08.860> suspends<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:09.460> ball<00:02:09.640> now

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
so the dispenser suspends the ball now

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.050 
so the dispenser suspends the ball now
and<00:02:10.060> then<00:02:10.540> to<00:02:10.929> successor<00:02:11.620> the<00:02:12.250> lamp<00:02:12.430> actuates

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
and then to successor the lamp actuates

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:30.160 
and then to successor the lamp actuates
and<00:02:14.010> that's<00:02:15.010> that

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.230 

you
