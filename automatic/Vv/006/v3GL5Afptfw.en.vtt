was fine to me at least and or they

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.359

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
that they have to do something with

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.359 
that they have to do something with
skill<00:01:33.960> based<00:01:34.140> matchmaking<00:01:34.320> in<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.890> next<00:01:35.159> game

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
skill based matchmaking in the next game

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.460 
skill based matchmaking in the next game
so<00:01:35.549> hopefully<00:01:36.119> they<00:01:36.600> will<00:01:36.750> do<00:01:36.869> something<00:01:37.200> with

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
so hopefully they will do something with

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.840 
so hopefully they will do something with
it<00:01:37.650> hopefully<00:01:37.829> they<00:01:38.100> won't<00:01:38.280> just<00:01:38.400> leave<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.759> as

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
it hopefully they won't just leave it as

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.330 
it hopefully they won't just leave it as
it<00:01:39.090> is<00:01:39.119> because<00:01:39.570> in<00:01:39.689> aw<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.409> don't<00:01:40.920> like<00:01:41.070> skip

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
it is because in aw I don't like skip

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.940

matchmaking<00:01:41.909> at<00:01:42.090> all<00:01:42.240> in<00:01:42.360> aw<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.590> next

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
matchmaking at all in aw so the next

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.319 
matchmaking at all in aw so the next
thing<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.280> they<00:01:44.670> could<00:01:44.820> take<00:01:45.000> out<00:01:45.149> the

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
thing is they could take out the

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.569 
thing is they could take out the
exosuits<00:01:46.020> or<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.320> just<00:01:46.409> tone<00:01:46.770> them<00:01:47.009> down<00:01:47.040> to

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
exosuits or you just tone them down to

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.069 
exosuits or you just tone them down to
me<00:01:47.729> like<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.180> know<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.390> don't<00:01:48.540> move<00:01:48.689> as<00:01:48.869> fast

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079

20 feet in the air so like it could be

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.450

constantly<00:02:35.780> how<00:02:36.020> aw<00:02:36.710> is<00:02:36.890> so<00:02:37.160> I<00:02:37.430> guess<00:02:38.090> from<00:02:38.360> the

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
constantly how aw is so I guess from the

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.290 
constantly how aw is so I guess from the
game<00:02:39.590> plan<00:02:39.770> I'm<00:02:39.890> seen<00:02:40.160> that<00:02:40.430> movements<00:02:40.880> in<00:02:41.000> bo3

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
game plan I'm seen that movements in bo3

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.830 
game plan I'm seen that movements in bo3
look<00:02:41.720> much<00:02:42.050> calm<00:02:42.440> and<00:02:42.800> much<00:02:43.340> subtle<00:02:44.060> so<00:02:44.330> a<00:02:44.360> lot

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
look much calm and much subtle so a lot

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.270 
look much calm and much subtle so a lot
of<00:02:44.870> people<00:02:45.020> do<00:02:45.380> have<00:02:45.530> mixed<00:02:45.680> feelings<00:02:45.860> for<00:02:46.220> the

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
of people do have mixed feelings for the

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.910 
of people do have mixed feelings for the
exosuits<00:02:46.850> and<00:02:47.090> to<00:02:47.660> be<00:02:47.810> safe<00:02:48.110> I<00:02:48.410> think<00:02:48.440> they

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
exosuits and to be safe I think they

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.620 
exosuits and to be safe I think they
should<00:02:49.100> just<00:02:49.130> take<00:02:49.550> them<00:02:49.730> out<00:02:49.940> or<00:02:50.209> something

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
should just take them out or something

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.000 
should just take them out or something
or<00:02:50.720> do<00:02:50.840> something<00:02:50.870> to<00:02:51.320> them<00:02:51.560> tone<00:02:51.830> them<00:02:51.980> down

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
or do something to them tone them down

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.520 
or do something to them tone them down
and<00:02:52.490> I<00:02:52.940> know<00:02:53.030> that<00:02:53.450> they<00:02:53.690> I<00:02:53.990> know<00:02:54.140> that<00:02:54.380> the

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
and I know that they I know that the

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.890 
and I know that they I know that the
exosuits<00:02:55.130> adds<00:02:55.310> something<00:02:55.730> new<00:02:56.090> and<00:02:56.420> that's

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
exosuits adds something new and that's

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.080 
exosuits adds something new and that's
pretty<00:02:57.170> unique<00:02:57.410> to<00:02:57.650> call<00:02:58.040> duty<00:02:58.370> but<00:02:58.670> playing

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
pretty unique to call duty but playing

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.240 
pretty unique to call duty but playing
call<00:02:59.480> vide<00:02:59.810> the<00:02:59.930> traditional<00:03:00.500> way<00:03:00.620> boots<00:03:01.160> on

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
call vide the traditional way boots on

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.250 
call vide the traditional way boots on
the<00:03:01.340> ground<00:03:01.370> is<00:03:01.850> much<00:03:02.450> better<00:03:02.690> in<00:03:02.930> my<00:03:03.080> opinion

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
the ground is much better in my opinion

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.740 
the ground is much better in my opinion
so<00:03:04.190> the<00:03:04.340> next<00:03:04.520> thing<00:03:04.790> they<00:03:05.030> can<00:03:05.209> improve<00:03:05.540> on

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
so the next thing they can improve on

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.540 
so the next thing they can improve on
from<00:03:06.020> advanced<00:03:06.500> warfare<00:03:06.530> is<00:03:07.040> weapon<00:03:07.370> variety

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.400 
kind of just ruins just the experience
because<00:03:55.459> you're<00:03:56.000> constantly<00:03:56.750> getting<00:03:57.140> killed

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
because you're constantly getting killed

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.470 
because you're constantly getting killed
by<00:03:57.530> the<00:03:57.560> same<00:03:57.920> guns<00:03:58.280> over<00:03:58.670> and<00:03:59.000> over<00:03:59.180> again<00:03:59.299> so

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
by the same guns over and over again so

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.229 
by the same guns over and over again so
you<00:04:00.080> know<00:04:00.560> hopefully<00:04:00.920> they<00:04:01.340> do<00:04:01.400> fix<00:04:01.880> that<00:04:02.150> and

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
you know hopefully they do fix that and

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.300 
you know hopefully they do fix that and
they<00:04:02.330> do<00:04:02.390> have<00:04:02.750> good<00:04:03.110> variety<00:04:03.680> and<00:04:03.890> this

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
they do have good variety and this

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.830 
they do have good variety and this
hoping<00:04:04.670> you<00:04:04.910> know<00:04:05.060> what<00:04:05.239> the<00:04:05.390> next<00:04:05.540> touch

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
hoping you know what the next touch

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.199 
hoping you know what the next touch
hammer<00:04:06.110> game<00:04:06.290> will<00:04:06.470> be<00:04:06.560> all<00:04:06.769> good<00:04:07.100> so<00:04:07.459> that<00:04:08.060> is

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
hammer game will be all good so that is

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:09.820 
hammer game will be all good so that is
pretty<00:04:08.390> much<00:04:08.510> the<00:04:08.690> weapon<00:04:09.290> and<00:04:09.380> balancing<00:04:09.739> and

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
pretty much the weapon and balancing and

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.650 
pretty much the weapon and balancing and
gun<00:04:09.950> variety<00:04:10.310> right<00:04:10.489> there<00:04:10.700> for<00:04:10.910> you<00:04:11.030> and<00:04:11.209> the

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
gun variety right there for you and the

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.350 
gun variety right there for you and the
next<00:04:11.690> and<00:04:12.260> final<00:04:12.320> thing<00:04:13.160> is<00:04:13.459> going<00:04:14.150> to<00:04:14.239> be

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
next and final thing is going to be

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.210 
next and final thing is going to be
about<00:04:14.570> supply<00:04:15.170> drops<00:04:15.560> in<00:04:15.739> the<00:04:15.860> weapon

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
about supply drops in the weapon

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.060 
about supply drops in the weapon
variants<00:04:16.700> so<00:04:16.970> with<00:04:17.690> that<00:04:17.989> I<00:04:18.049> do<00:04:18.320> think<00:04:18.890> there

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
variants so with that I do think there

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.219 
variants so with that I do think there
should<00:04:19.370> be<00:04:19.549> a<00:04:19.580> Supply<00:04:20.120> Drop<00:04:20.150> loading<00:04:20.750> system

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
should be a Supply Drop loading system

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:23.529 
should be a Supply Drop loading system
on<00:04:21.320> the<00:04:21.380> next<00:04:21.620> ledge<00:04:21.799> hammer<00:04:22.039> game<00:04:22.280> a<00:04:22.550> but<00:04:23.090> to

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:23.539 
on the next ledge hammer game a but to

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:26.200 
on the next ledge hammer game a but to
make<00:04:23.720> it<00:04:23.900> fair<00:04:24.380> I<00:04:24.740> don't<00:04:25.310> think<00:04:25.669> there<00:04:25.910> she

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
make it fair I don't think there she

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.749 
make it fair I don't think there she
the<00:04:26.389> weapon<00:04:27.229> variants<00:04:27.800> that<00:04:27.860> have<00:04:28.039> stat

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:28.759 
the weapon variants that have stat

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:31.540 
the weapon variants that have stat
increases<00:04:29.389> /<00:04:29.900> decreases<00:04:30.740> and<00:04:31.069> instead<00:04:31.490> of

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
increases / decreases and instead of

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.629 
increases / decreases and instead of
that<00:04:31.880> I<00:04:32.120> think<00:04:32.240> that<00:04:32.660> having<00:04:33.169> cosmetic

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:33.639 
that I think that having cosmetic

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.670 
that I think that having cosmetic
variants<00:04:34.639> will<00:04:34.789> be<00:04:34.880> much<00:04:35.150> better<00:04:35.569> so<00:04:36.319> they

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
variants will be much better so they

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.529 
variants will be much better so they
actually<00:04:36.860> do<00:04:37.190> this<00:04:37.310> with<00:04:37.520> the<00:04:37.729> ak-12<00:04:38.120> in<00:04:38.389> this

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:38.539 
actually do this with the ak-12 in this

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:41.020 
actually do this with the ak-12 in this
game<00:04:38.780> they<00:04:39.319> have<00:04:39.349> the<00:04:39.770> ak-12<00:04:40.250> G<00:04:40.610> which<00:04:40.849> is<00:04:40.880> the

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
game they have the ak-12 G which is the

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.270 
game they have the ak-12 G which is the
Gosei<00:04:41.630> K<00:04:41.900> and<00:04:42.169> doesn't<00:04:42.680> have<00:04:42.770> any<00:04:42.949> stat

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
Gosei K and doesn't have any stat

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.610 
Gosei K and doesn't have any stat
increases<00:04:43.729> or<00:04:43.970> decreases<00:04:44.150> at<00:04:44.690> all<00:04:44.840> all<00:04:45.169> it<00:04:45.440> has

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
increases or decreases at all all it has

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.710 
increases or decreases at all all it has
is<00:04:45.650> just<00:04:45.889> a<00:04:46.190> different<00:04:46.699> look<00:04:46.940> has<00:04:47.180> a<00:04:47.210> different

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
is just a different look has a different

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.480 
is just a different look has a different
camo<00:04:47.990> and<00:04:48.259> different<00:04:48.590> iron<00:04:48.860> sights<00:04:49.190> and<00:04:49.430> I

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
camo and different iron sights and I

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.670 
camo and different iron sights and I
like<00:04:49.789> how<00:04:50.330> they<00:04:50.539> did<00:04:50.599> that<00:04:51.050> and<00:04:51.259> that<00:04:51.530> also

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
like how they did that and that also

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.770 
like how they did that and that also
shows<00:04:52.220> that<00:04:52.250> they<00:04:52.759> can't<00:04:53.090> have<00:04:53.300> cosmetic

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
shows that they can't have cosmetic

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.020
