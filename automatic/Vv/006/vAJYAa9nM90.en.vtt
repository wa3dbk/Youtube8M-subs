they<00:01:56.740> go<00:01:56.859> up<00:01:56.979> so<00:01:57.219> I'd<00:01:57.399> building<00:01:58.359> treehouses<00:01:58.509> or

00:01:59.069 --> 00:01:59.079 
they go up so I'd building treehouses or

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:00.870 
they go up so I'd building treehouses or
bases<00:01:59.409> up<00:01:59.530> here<00:01:59.710> would<00:01:59.859> be<00:01:59.979> amazing<00:02:00.399> and<00:02:00.729> it's

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
so the giant trees will go and continue

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.530 
so the giant trees will go and continue
a<00:02:41.010> little<00:02:41.070> bit<00:02:41.250> more<00:02:41.430> starting<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:41.850> nozzle

center of the jungle and I can get us to

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.510 
center of the jungle and I can get us to
load<00:02:54.690> not<00:02:55.410> sure<00:02:55.590> why<00:02:55.740> but<00:02:56.010> once<00:02:56.220> you<00:02:56.340> load<00:02:56.490> a

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
load not sure why but once you load a

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.800 
load not sure why but once you load a
bunch<00:02:56.700> of<00:02:56.820> the<00:02:56.880> jungle<00:02:57.240> it's<00:02:57.360> kind<00:02:57.570> of<00:02:57.600> hard<00:02:57.780> to

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
bunch of the jungle it's kind of hard to

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.180 
bunch of the jungle it's kind of hard to
get<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:58.080> learn<00:02:58.200> more<00:02:58.440> especially<00:02:58.890> with<00:02:59.040> my

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
get to learn more especially with my

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.490 
get to learn more especially with my
device<00:02:59.490> I<00:02:59.700> have<00:02:59.790> the<00:03:00.360> original<00:03:00.990> iPad<00:03:01.110> Mini
