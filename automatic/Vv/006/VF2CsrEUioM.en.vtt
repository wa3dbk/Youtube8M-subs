 youtube of gta5 I found the video of 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.109
 interesting because the guy shows what 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:28.019
 happens when a police car 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:29.550
 ends up running out of lights because he hit or 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.640
 something like that 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.520
 The cool thing is that when this happens and 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.190

 to light the way I found it quite cool 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.809
 the level of detail that the rockstar 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:51.090

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.850

 these buildings have already been 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.979

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.950
