00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.100
 before starting to disassemble the tap what 

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:08.769
 first thing we have to do is close 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:12.480
 the tap water we have 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:12.480
 placed under the sink 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.690
 we close it and we no longer have water in the 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.279
 tap to dismantle what is the 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.890
 first the first thing we have to 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:26.949
 dismantle will be 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.770
 the accessories like the crest and 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:31.210
 terminals 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.550
 with a screwdriver 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.900
 we do a little leverage and what 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.930
 we remove 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:43.140
 and the crest by inserting the screwdriver 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:45.840
 and doing a little tug 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.730
 We have the aluminum piece removed with 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.930
 a screwdriver suitable for the screw 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.930
 we remove the screw 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.610
 we need as many screws as I have 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.030
 this is the crest and we remove the 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.030
 pompadour 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.110
 then we remove the sink 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.330
 before removing the sink 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.680
 would have to dismantle the tap but it 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.400
 You can disassemble the sink with the 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.400
 tap included 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.409
 we open the door and with a key 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.359
 english we dismantled the hoses from 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.200
 the stopcocks we adjust the key 

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:32.850
 English to the nut and loosen once 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.700
 that loosen with the same hand we can 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.409
 disassemble it will drip a little bit 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.130
 of water but normal is the water that is 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.120
 we are left in the hose 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.770
 we also remove the other 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.770
 and we disassembled the valve 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.870
 there are sinks that come anchored with 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:57.210
 some staples and there are others that just 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.510
 They carry some silicone in the way of 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.510
 I hit 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.060
 we look if the one we have has claws and 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:08.209
 we take them apart 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.720
 we already have it loose we dismantled the 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.290
 sink 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.980
 in the same way we disassemble the plate and 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.959
 then we dismantle the countertop 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:22.420
 most countertops are picked 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.420
 by a screw we remove the screw 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.080
 so 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:33.120
 and we have already loose the first 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.560
 let's measure to give the cut to the 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.310
 new countertop 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.830
 we measure the furniture and remember 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.660
 we give it two or three centimeters to the 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.590
 new countertop to have the flight 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.660
 we passed the measure to the new countertop 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.110
 we mark the 3 centimeters more than 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.110
 we have said 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.950
 with the help of the squad 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.160
 we mark a line 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:08.670
 so that we get a straight line 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:12.450
 we use the jigsaw 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.340
 and we adjust it to give us the cut 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.459
 before you start using a 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.459
 tool 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.600
 we protect ourselves 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.300
 and glasses and gloves 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:28.440
 then we give the cut always 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.440
 very carefully 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:51.510
 if you notice , I gave the cut to the 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.700
 countertop by the part that is not seen for 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.920
 that the wood 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.590
 with the blade not rib and we were 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.870
 be efe to the part above 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.080
 taking the measurements of where the 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.670
 sink with the holes for it what 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.860
 we move 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.220
 to what is the countertop we measure the 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.220
 sink 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.590
 but not in total to him we have to 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.850
 discount an inch and a half to 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.450
 what 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.360
 I stepped on the sink on the countertop and 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.909
 we mark 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.490
 always remembering that we are 

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:30.600
 working for you 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:33.180
 this type of countertop 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:36.390
 it's a chipboard countertop comes 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:39.030
 dressed by only the top part or 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:41.250
 on both sides the material is very 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.800
 economic with which we can change the 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.800
 aesthetics of our kitchen when we 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.570
 feel like they already have track where the 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.080
 location of sink and plate 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:55.670
 with the drill and a wood drill 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.670
 make some holes in the corners 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.040
 to facilitate 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.319
 and the entrance 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:12.660
 the saw blade out of it 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.450
 we put very carefully and first 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:18.580
 time if we hold since the blade 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:22.590
 does not have 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.590
 the security to start the cut 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:39.840
 we have already made a cut we will continue 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:42.659
 cutting the corner and one thing 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.550
 so that we do not drop the board that 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:47.910
 we are cutting 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:51.090
 As a handle a trick is to put a 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:54.960
 screw to hold the plate before 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:59.210
 that we fall or damage the profile of the 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:01.200
 countertop with the help of the screw 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.750
 we help us 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:06.880
 to not let the board fall 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:09.900
 we have the board cut out 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.900
 we present it 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:22.710
 Screw with the countertop just like the 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:25.680
 we had previously 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:27.680
 once it has caught many 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:32.130
 countertops come with a finish 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:34.340
 plastic so they will not be made as 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:37.150
 we have to put 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:40.990
 what is the decoration piece 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:43.500
 in the back we remove the plastic 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.500
 abroad
