00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.350
 hi everyone is today I 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.140
 will show you as one of the capped 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.469
 wood so then here I'm going to remove this 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.440
 varnish that is that no longer protects the 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.680
 wood so I'm going to remove it for the 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:20.279
 redo you will need a palette 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:24.090
 a brush is crazy crazy in for 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:29.580
 protect your hands and of course 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.539
 stripper up is only apparent so I 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.930
 opened the box because she is 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.210
 almost finished here then to begin 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.940
 you take a little stripper on your 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.239
 brush 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:44.370
 knowing that it's a gene it's a gel 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:47.760
 and you drop some on the wood part 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:54.239
 that you are going from stage and so you in 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:57.690
 spend a thick layer very 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.300
 thick even for it to be the most 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.300
 effective possible 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.300
 hop 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.980
 but in a little bit everywhere 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.780
 because even if you do not see 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.520
 allowed sometimes it stays a little bit and that 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.980
 becomes a little bit invisible hop 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.910
 so now we're going to let the 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.310
 stripper act 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:29.910
 we will come back as soon as the stripper 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.950
 will have acted then there as you see it the 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.560
 stripper acted you have small 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.260
 bubbles that have formed and so you 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.080
 can scrape the polish that has been 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:45.140
 detached from the wood so we will start 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:55.530
 hop hop hop 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:57.630
 so all the laces of the varnish so 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.880
 do not hesitate to redo another layer 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.310
 of strippers to remove the last 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.390
 layer of varnish that remains is a 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:10.710
 very thin layer and that's so it was 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:13.890
 how to bundle wood in order to remove 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:18.320
 the nail polish thanks for having to have 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.320
 watched this video and see you next time
