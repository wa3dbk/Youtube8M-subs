using<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.690> single<00:00:10.170> master<00:00:10.559> set<00:00:10.800> let's<00:00:11.490> take<00:00:11.820> a

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
using a single master set let's take a

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.680 
using a single master set let's take a
look<00:00:12.530> this<00:00:13.530> is<00:00:13.830> called<00:00:14.309> karidian<00:00:14.969> forest

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
look this is called karidian forest

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.349 
look this is called karidian forest
which<00:00:16.619> looks<00:00:16.949> very<00:00:17.250> simple<00:00:17.730> it's<00:00:17.910> just<00:00:18.090> grass

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
which looks very simple it's just grass

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.890 
which looks very simple it's just grass
and<00:00:18.690> water<00:00:19.430> now<00:00:20.430> this<00:00:20.730> is<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.970> special<00:00:21.359> rule<00:00:21.689> set

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
and water now this is a special rule set

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.769 
and water now this is a special rule set
that<00:00:22.020> I<00:00:22.080> have<00:00:22.289> set<00:00:22.529> up<00:00:22.650> which<00:00:23.369> involves<00:00:23.970> good

super savar that has double attack a
double<00:01:21.030> defense<00:01:21.330> adds<00:01:21.689> two<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.619> his<00:01:22.710> move<00:01:22.979> and

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
double defense adds two to his move and

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.249 
double defense adds two to his move and
adds<00:01:23.820> Porter's<00:01:24.360> range<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:25.650> with<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.130> sabores

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
adds Porter's range so with that sabores

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.960 
adds Porter's range so with that sabores
can<00:01:28.259> get<00:01:28.409> fast<00:01:28.710> enough<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.159> actually<00:01:29.280> climb<00:01:29.759> on

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
can get fast enough to actually climb on

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.270 
can get fast enough to actually climb on
top<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:30.210> these<00:01:30.479> treetops<00:01:31.049> here<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.530> with<00:01:32.130> his

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
top of these treetops here and with his

twice<00:01:35.430> with<00:01:36.210> double<00:01:36.540> dice<00:01:36.750> on<00:01:37.020> any<00:01:37.710> figure

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
twice with double dice on any figure

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.240 
twice with double dice on any figure
pretty<00:01:39.630> much<00:01:39.780> on<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.020> map<00:01:40.290> within<00:01:40.530> range<00:01:40.890> and

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
pretty much on the map within range and

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.550 
pretty much on the map within range and
within<00:01:41.579> his<00:01:41.790> line<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.150> sight<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:43.140> is

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
within his line of sight so that is

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.560 
within his line of sight so that is
incredibly<00:01:44.100> nasty<00:01:44.369> if<00:01:44.759> he<00:01:44.939> can<00:01:45.090> pull<00:01:45.299> it<00:01:45.479> off

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
incredibly nasty if he can pull it off

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.990 
incredibly nasty if he can pull it off
on<00:01:45.869> there<00:01:46.560> are<00:01:46.680> many<00:01:46.860> strategies<00:01:47.130> here<00:01:47.759> for

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
on there are many strategies here for

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.230 
on there are many strategies here for
example<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.509> drop<00:01:48.750> can<00:01:48.960> be<00:01:49.079> very<00:01:49.380> useful<00:01:50.240> here

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
example the drop can be very useful here

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.850 
example the drop can be very useful here
to<00:01:51.390> get<00:01:51.540> them<00:01:51.750> on<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.049> glyphs<00:01:52.320> as<00:01:52.500> soon<00:01:52.710> as

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
to get them on the glyphs as soon as

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.020 
to get them on the glyphs as soon as
possible<00:01:54.200> flyers<00:01:55.200> can<00:01:56.009> quickly<00:01:56.430> get<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.909> the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
possible flyers can quickly get to the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.910 
possible flyers can quickly get to the
glyphs<00:01:57.299> as<00:01:57.479> well<00:01:57.689> so<00:01:58.619> there's<00:01:58.799> many

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
glyphs as well so there's many

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.969 
glyphs as well so there's many
possibilities<00:01:59.520> for<00:02:00.030> that<00:02:00.409> what<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.530> defense

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
possibilities for that what the defense

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.830 
possibilities for that what the defense
pretty<00:02:02.250> much<00:02:02.399> has<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.640> do<00:02:02.880> is<00:02:03.119> defend<00:02:03.540> against

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
pretty much has to do is defend against

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.050 
pretty much has to do is defend against
these<00:02:04.020> glyphs<00:02:04.380> so<00:02:05.280> there's<00:02:05.460> many<00:02:05.579> possible

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
these glyphs so there's many possible

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.719 
these glyphs so there's many possible
strategies<00:02:06.630> for<00:02:06.899> that<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.829> can<00:02:08.039> have<00:02:08.310> grim

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
strategies for that you can have grim

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.609 
strategies for that you can have grim
neff<00:02:08.910> try<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.390> take<00:02:09.509> out<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.690> squad<00:02:10.140> figures

neff try and take out the squad figures

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.620 
neff try and take out the squad figures
that<00:02:10.950> are<00:02:10.979> trying<00:02:11.340> to
