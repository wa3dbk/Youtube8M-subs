00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:12.900
 hello there rogan ivan 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:15.760
 and in this video we will look at you 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.939
 the problem is due to a long shutdown 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.180
 computer some it happens that 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:25.050
 when a person enters the start menu 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.930
 shut down the computer turns off and 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:32.590
 the computer is frozen in one place and not 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.629
 it is impossible to say for sure though 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.600
 what reason can there be reasons 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:41.409
 several first reason is it possible 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:44.859
 your computer is infected with viruses for this 

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:46.899
 we will need an antivirus using it 

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:50.319
 You will need to search for this virus 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:52.289
 something and you will if the virus does not 

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:54.659
 found by the way 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.350
 use kaspersky internet security 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:59.909
 licensed version 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:03.789
 that is, the purchase then you just wake 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:05.370
 It is not accurately 98 percent of you 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:09.579
 can you give yourself the answer 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:11.860
 have a virus here or not a virus if u 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:13.810
 you only once the computer is so frozen 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.509
 and does not turn off 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.700
 restart your computer try it 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.039
 turn off again if this procedure 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.219
 repeated again then it means you 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:27.430
 some problem one more tip which 

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:30.119
 I can advise this rollback your system 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.530
 i.e. system restore 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:39.299
 performed on the start menu all 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:42.570
 programs are looking for a standard daddy 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.570
 special abilities 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:54.260
 so i remember our service pro mom here 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.860
 before office daddy recovery 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.860
 systems 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:05.690
 here we click further and here I created 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:08.830
 computer recovery point 3 numbers 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:11.930
 that is, on November 3rd today is the fourth 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:15.470
 so if you want to roll back 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.600
 or restore your system somewhat 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.470
 days ago which was earlier ie before 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:24.350
 virus to this problem then 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:29.300
 use this program but there is 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:31.790
 but one have a recovery 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:36.050
 computer system you should have been doing 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.970
 in advance that is work let you 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.030
 today the computer is working fine 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.040
 created a point this is a restoration and all 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.610
 work on suddenly you in a month 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.890
 there will be some problem you can 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.520
 numbers already do a restore like this 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.610
 everything is done this is a separate lesson 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.110
 You can search on my channel 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:01.250
 the content of my lessons principle is 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:04.940
 it is also described maybe you have a problem with 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.680
 response program that is if cast 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.530
 programs 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.870
 about 12 seconds delay then it means 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:15.380
 you have some problems is usually 34 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:18.290
 maximum 5 seconds i.e. if 12 seconds 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:23.210
 means your program has hung so 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:27.920
 how it is done so the virus I close 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:32.920
 go to the start menu in this search line 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:35.920
 we need to type in English and 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.920
 gedit 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.810
 here and to us this regedit program 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:56.790
 there we go in daddy testicles local match 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:04:00.680
 so you can open it like this 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:09.269
 we are looking for this daddy with happiness we open 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:12.330
 take control z go here so no it 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.989
 it is necessary here it is better to choose 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:17.489
 daddy 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:19.459
 contour set kurin also open 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:23.450
 daddy's control 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:28.940
 there we have a bunch of backstage here 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.940
 we go down looking 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.160
 So 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:41.419
 Daddy principle, there is no need to look here 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:43.360
 just need to control labor and press 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:49.430
 we see see here 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:53.000
 weight to kill timeout service click 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:57.400
 on it twice so or value us here 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:02.530
 while for 12,000 it means 12 seconds 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:06.979
 let's put 5 thousand click ok 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:10.880
 so on this principle so give u 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:13.159
 another case with you consider so 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:17.860
 go start menu here again the line 

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:21.789
 search write jeep 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.789
 edit edit 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.900
 So 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.900
 . 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:38.759
 MSC 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.819
 here we have finally clicked 

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:40.819
 here 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:47.310
 so we click and configure the computer 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.449
 let's take a principle here 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:06:00.199
 so we have a computer configuration here 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:04.280
 opened the click on the arrow configuration 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:11.229
 windows so go parameters 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:11.229
 security go local policies 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:22.209
 security settings so click here 

00:06:19.369 --> 00:06:25.339
 shutdown swap file 

00:06:22.209 --> 00:06:28.089
 virtual memory you may be 

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:30.639
 it is written differently here 

00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:34.159
 click on it twice 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:36.399
 tick the court off click click 

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:36.399
 flour 

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:43.129
 now you need to restart the computer 

00:06:38.809 --> 00:06:45.580
