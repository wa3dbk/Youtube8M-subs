be talking a little bit more about

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.669 
be talking a little bit more about
battery<00:00:10.800> safety<00:00:11.330> now<00:00:12.330> most<00:00:13.139> people<00:00:13.230> when<00:00:13.650> they

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
battery safety now most people when they

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.410 
battery safety now most people when they
come<00:00:13.950> into<00:00:14.130> e-cigarettes<00:00:14.820> for<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.240> very

come into e-cigarettes for the very
first<00:00:15.630> time<00:00:15.780> they're<00:00:16.139> not<00:00:16.170> going<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.500> know

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
first time they're not going to know

first time they're not going to know
exactly<00:00:16.740> what<00:00:17.160> they're<00:00:17.250> getting<00:00:17.520> into<00:00:17.640> which

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
exactly what they're getting into which

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.810 
exactly what they're getting into which
is<00:00:18.180> why<00:00:18.810> are<00:00:18.869> we<00:00:19.050> doing<00:00:19.170> this<00:00:19.350> video<00:00:19.670> this<00:00:20.670> is

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
is why are we doing this video this is

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.519 
is why are we doing this video this is
going<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.000> be<00:00:21.119> more<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.480> boring<00:00:21.869> subject<00:00:22.320> of

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
going to be more the boring subject of

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.189 
going to be more the boring subject of
the<00:00:22.800> matter<00:00:23.119> but<00:00:24.119> it's<00:00:24.240> very<00:00:24.359> very<00:00:24.689> important

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
the matter but it's very very important

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.859 
the matter but it's very very important
now<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:26.550> might<00:00:26.760> see<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.000> course<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.420> lot<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.660> us

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
now you might see a course a lot of us

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.550 
now you might see a course a lot of us
advanced<00:00:28.740> vapors<00:00:29.250> or<00:00:30.230> enthusiasts<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.349> show

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
advanced vapors or enthusiasts to show

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.420 
advanced vapors or enthusiasts to show
say<00:00:31.830> we<00:00:32.640> have<00:00:32.880> cloud<00:00:33.600> chaser<00:00:34.250> platforms<00:00:35.250> or

sub<00:00:36.120> 0<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.360> builds<00:00:36.660> now<00:00:37.469> you<00:00:37.530> want<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.800> be

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
sub 0 and builds now you want to be

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.100 
sub 0 and builds now you want to be
careful<00:00:38.070> with<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.399> because<00:00:39.020> once<00:00:40.020> again

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
careful with that because once again

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.840 
careful with that because once again
it's<00:00:40.469> very<00:00:40.530> very<00:00:40.980> dangerous<00:00:41.129> when<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.579> get<00:00:41.730> to

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
it's very very dangerous when you get to

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.520 
it's very very dangerous when you get to
it<00:00:42.000> because<00:00:42.360> when<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.690> comes<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.960> rebuildable

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
it because when it comes to rebuildable

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.650 
it because when it comes to rebuildable
as<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.710> short<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.250> is<00:00:44.370> there's<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.360> lot<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:46.579> well

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660
