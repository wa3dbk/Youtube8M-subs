00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:14.200
 but I'm going with a part of the hair that 

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:18.470
 because it can be a light color can be 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.970
 a dark brown color if so is a 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.850
 light color that would be like a kind 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.040
 of 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.570
 of blond pulling as in ocher tones 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.670
 it would be more complicated because trying 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.560
 find that color tone like skin 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.710
 more complicated but let's do it with 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.780
 a darker color with sepia or 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.230
 bandai if he has it out there and the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.330
 yellow color can be yellow I think 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.340
 that I do not have it right now is that 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.890
 I also sometimes when I come 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.649
 for here 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.000
 I forgot some special color already 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:53.070
 I get in trouble but not 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.970
 taking into account that I can work with 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.440
 the cp and the yellow cambodia then with that 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.900
 I can work tranquility has the 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.440
 hair that fits through the front we 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.140
 to see if I get here 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.480
 and then I come to the other side 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:12.410
 with a curl that falls directly 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.410
 in this part 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.439
 Now I'm going to show you one of the 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.420
 paintings of one of my students in a 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:22.820
 just for you to be 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.380
 preparations I will present today to a 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.380
 rabbit painting 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.950
 that student that has been wonderful 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.750
 a great painter that I have done in many 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.510
 sometimes he assists me in the classes 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.360
 when there are many people then he 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.830
 collaborate with me and go over the 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.500
 work of my students 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.840
 ravi is very popular on facebook when 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.380
 I have it and people always comment 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.550
 all his work 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.390
 good this part the yellow 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.600
 And coffee 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:00.740
 you have to work it nonchalantly 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:03.079
 I think I have one to make him 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.240
 too much detail nothing more imposing the 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:07.360
 color in some parts to see the 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.069
 yellow in others 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.840
 more coffee like in this case 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.400
 If there is a lot of color intensity 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.760
 throw water 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:20.299
 to the color and a little bit of the 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:23.780
 strength of the nuance and with that we work a 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:25.590
 little bit more relieved that he does not go to 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.680
 be that we 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.440
 we drop the color tone very strong 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.129
 there then it will be a problem for the 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.650
 time to paint 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:36.480
 I'm not going to do much detail remember 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.680
 that is a little the space of time 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.510
 then I will go working in reality 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.030
 with 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.689
 He is working faster and doing 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.689
 a job rather 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:54.220
 almost as impressionistic in terms of 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:57.160
 watercolor true blemishes and more than anything 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.650
 the back and it's a part a lot 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.020
 more intense in dark color 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.170
 then all this area is stained 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:08.910
 look for part of the hair here 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:12.340
 look for him to get close to the nape 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.709
 so we can hide the reality 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.989
 His hair is tied back and he does not 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:20.080
 let's complicate a lot of good we're going to 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:22.560
 complicate a lot of life in that part 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.430
 There's the box Ravin 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.319
 It's some kittens that he painted in watercolor 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.770
 fantastic work very well crafted 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:34.230
 with a very special grace taking in 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:37.819
 notice that kittens that are with a 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.040
 dark background and it looks pretty good 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:42.170
 trimmed 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.240
 they have enough 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.340
 thanks in the details that you put 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.950
 rabbit and that makes course 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.959
 see the picture very nice 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.950
 that was the picture I wanted to present 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.950
 is today 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.720
 with the hair going down a little bit 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.820
 that is a bit complicated because 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.720
 As I tell you, I would like to have more 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:07.660
 chance to make a greater 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:11.170
 display here of details but not 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.160
 I can do it part of the fund that already 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.450
 had traced in the previous 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:20.040
 I will repeat it here 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:23.120
 it's blue with black 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:26.500
 and go making him of those parts 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.760
 and rescue it I go without putting more color 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.670
 going up what I can do is clarify it 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.250
 with water 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:35.260
 so that it looks much softer 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.070
 the tone that I wanted was a contrast 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:42.030
 nothing else in the background 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:44.520
 and the dress so that it will be noticed enough 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.840
 I'm disappearing here, I do not think 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.620
 what 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.030
 I will serve you fill it very strong or 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.360
 with a lot of intensity in the part 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:57.220
 superior is the stain nothing more 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:59.560
 to trim part of her skin 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.210
 it can be cut abruptly and I do not think 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.580
 having any problem is there 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.980
 people who are afraid to make those changes 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.830
 brusque of color with reality the 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:12.490
 spots often favor a lot 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:15.220
 this then this will paint the 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.409
