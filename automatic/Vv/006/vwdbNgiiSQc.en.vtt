00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:07.460
 ah 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:09.800
 hello youtube today we will learn to do 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:14.200
 a paper rainbow mobile for 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.200
 decorate your room your house or your party 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.740
 first we will cut 7 strips of different 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.440
 colors of 2.5 centimeters wide the 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.120
 long will be different for each strip a 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.060
 will be the length of a letter-sized sheet 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:52.820
 and from there we will go down 2 centimeters 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.820
 more to each one in respect to the previous 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:09.330
 so that you are left like this now 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.480
 we accommodate all one over another 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:16.430
 thus making them match or matching 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.430
 down here and we record 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.409
 i 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:36.340
 the largest strip should be above the 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.200
 let's take it like that to form a bow and 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.660
 little by little we stretch the strips more 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.830
 short to match them all in 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.830
 the end of the big 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.370
 ah 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:03.910
 and will be forming our rainbow and 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.910
 that are all well accommodated we record 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:13.660
 now we will make a perforation that is 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.660
 well centered on the arch above 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.420
 good 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.150
 We place long cotton yarn that 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.890
 you want this will be to hang it and 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.290
 we tie a knot so it does not come off 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.660
 then we make 3 holes in the 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.020
 last hoop also focused and we put 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.480
 3 threads being the shortest middle one 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.370
 that the other two the next thing is to form 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.130
 a few drops of water for this 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.290
 we need 9 rectangles of 7 x 4 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.560
 centimeters we are going to fold them by the 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.560
 half 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.400
 and in one of them we will draw half 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.400
 of a drop 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.460
 do not 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.790
 we cut 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.560
 and we unfolded and we should stay like this now 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.130
 we will use this as a basis to do 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.130
 the others 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.090
 since you have each drop will be formed 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.910
 of three figures of these we place 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.250
 cold silicone in the thread and stick by the 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.890
 bend each figure taking care not to be left 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.310
 none stuck on the sides just for 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.310
 the fold 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.960
 have 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.400
 m 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.260
 and you will have something like that 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.630
 And finally we'll just stick cotton or 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.180
 pom-poms on the sides of the rainbow 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.950
 to form the clouds and you're ready 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.140
 your mobile that will remind you that after 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.940
 the storm always comes calm use it 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.560
 to decorate your bedroom a party or 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.950
