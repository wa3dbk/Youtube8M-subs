00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello everyone with you again i'm fox and 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.760
 today I will tell you how to do 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:15.509
 rocking on skeletons or zombies we take 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:18.660
 zombies so now let's go to mean 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.770
 the main thing we do after you 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.920
 found spavner zombies 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.609
 we drop three blocks down under it 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.240
 freeing up 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.439
 the room needs to spin like 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:33.000
 cut off lenses for she damn 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.380
 demonstrations well, usually it's three on 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.840
 three blocks and 2 by 2 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.460
 around well just spinning 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:44.070
 dug three blocks down 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:46.620
 about that is also an important factor here are the walls 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.309
 Well, yes, actually, that I am you 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.219
 I ask around them something is desirable 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.899
 on block 56 make land and grass 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:58.710
 or by any stumbling block in which 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:02.820
 you should preferably be best stoned and 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:06.530
 smart hatch so did block and down 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:10.520
 so we make a hole there will be 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:14.939
 we count 8 blocks of that we count 1 2 3 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:20.369
 4 5 6 7 8 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:22.970
 pour water she will push the zombies 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:27.630
 in this hole in which they will fall 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:30.000
 after that we do the same with the second 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.829
 hand now show i love water 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.200
 movin slowly raced here this 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:38.930
 minus you see that is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.670
 blocks 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.530
 like zombies that is zombies will fall 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.119
 down they will sleep the water is straight to us 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.119
 rocking chair i 'm doing the same 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.119
 such 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:02:00.060
 and who is to watch what is there 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:03.220
 going on will take place zombies now and 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.880
 I put access to 1 there with swords with 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.860
 stone 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.539
 of the things that zombies will attack 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.929
 wto here we are randomly crafting 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:15.190
 I write I write if I must do there in myself 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.300
 mine exit and mine exit either or and trace 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.340
 on the heart, I just can 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.730
 teleport home and be sure 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.370
 make a hyphen afterwards 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.850
 we bring it who places where there will be a pallet 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.220
 here I decided to put the glass 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:33.850
 because it's so convenient to watch soon 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:38.830
 fall let's do it doesn't take 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:41.500
 a lot of time now include complexity 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.380
 give and light enough and wait for now 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:48.700
 a zombie will usually take place if 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:51.640
 occurs violence or solitary with 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.190
 the complexity of the passenger is very spanish 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.590
 fast and quite two 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.959
 three knee beats cha why am i not 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.890
 I advise you to do a lot of how they jump 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:08.040
 for something here i tell them how you see 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:10.690
 so I am here a lot of only 1 of ours 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.090
 why I advise you to do very 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:17.290
 deep down I somehow tried to do 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:19.180
 on one all down dug blocks of 32 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.760
 Well, because I just do not because you and the zombies 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.310
 I do not have the capital have to stand there and 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.950
 wait for them to be dachshund get on 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.870
 Here is how you see them 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.620
 very easy to kill, they will interfere 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:36.359
 nothing brings any inconvenience 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:39.639
 different and get away Khanate 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:44.049
 tomorrow blow here but usually it 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:46.840
 digging around for 15 to a maximum of 18 something 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:49.900
 there is and that does not fall on block 15 if their 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.510
 stay dobby again until stone sword i 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:58.090
 did on 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:04:00.940
 12 blocks down below that is and that 15 he 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.520
 departed 8 did not sit down deeply to 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.130
 show for visual demonstration 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:08.910
 principle cloud is very easy that is like me 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.910
 already said . 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.769
 that is, there is nothing complicated about the construction 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:24.350
 that is, not just digging 3 beam in 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.690
 wood rocking at its set 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:31.389
 water to wash off zombies drops hitting my 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.389
 then we dig what to do 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.520
 then we all close what he sees 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:46.120
 page spawn 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.990
 and drip down the passage to fit kim 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.060
 and finish them later 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:52.319
 that it is necessary to remember the main thing so that 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.729
 spavner 

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:56.740
 either did not give any advice or how 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:59.560
 less I can do it now 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.129
 when the charter put here below because 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.860
 below 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:05.469
 the light no longer plays any role explain 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.300
 why because the zombie wall has already fallen 

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:09.939
 they are already there you should not spawn 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.340
 completely mouth does not prevent them from spawning and you them 

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:14.439
 can easily kill basically everything with 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.870
 you were a fox subscribe to the channel 

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:19.349
 put the likes under the video for new meetings 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.349
 until
