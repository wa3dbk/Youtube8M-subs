really<00:00:07.649> is<00:00:07.799> very<00:00:08.010> very<00:00:08.220> simple<00:00:08.490> assignments

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
really is very very simple assignments

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.370 
really is very very simple assignments
we've<00:00:09.240> ever<00:00:09.420> seen<00:00:09.570> wherever<00:00:09.929> you<00:00:10.110> need<00:00:10.260> to<00:00:10.290> be

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
we've ever seen wherever you need to be

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.180 
we've ever seen wherever you need to be
and<00:00:10.710> then<00:00:11.370> what<00:00:11.969> a<00:00:12.360> minute<00:00:12.690> on<00:00:12.809> each<00:00:12.840> end<00:00:13.620> its

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
and then what a minute on each end its

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.279 
and then what a minute on each end its
self-supporting<00:00:14.940> so<00:00:15.120> we're<00:00:15.330> yeah<00:00:16.049> you<00:00:16.109> don't

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
self-supporting so we're yeah you don't

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.810 
self-supporting so we're yeah you don't
even<00:00:16.410> have<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.710> find<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:17.070> level<00:00:17.220> perfectly

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
even have to find a level perfectly

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.400 
even have to find a level perfectly
level<00:00:18.029> ground<00:00:18.270> for<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.750> wherever<00:00:19.170> it's<00:00:19.350> being

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
level ground for the wherever it's being

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.170 
level ground for the wherever it's being
cited<00:00:19.949> but<00:00:20.400> there's<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.640> powers<00:00:20.850> of<00:00:20.910> hand<00:00:21.090> of

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
cited but there's the powers of hand of

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.370 
cited but there's the powers of hand of
the<00:00:21.240> panel's<00:00:21.510> work<00:00:21.660> now<00:00:21.779> we've<00:00:21.900> taken<00:00:22.080> the

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
the panel's work now we've taken the

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.779 
the panel's work now we've taken the
rest<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.769> box<00:00:22.949> in<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.340> connectional<00:00:23.670> way

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
rest of the box in the connectional way

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.849 
rest of the box in the connectional way
but<00:00:23.970> this<00:00:24.060> is<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.300> system<00:00:24.480> it<00:00:25.410> really<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:25.830> very

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
but this is the system it really is very

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.250 
but this is the system it really is very
simple<00:00:26.330> the<00:00:27.330> panel's<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:27.779> saw<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:27.990> wires

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
simple the panel's you saw the wires

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.109 
simple the panel's you saw the wires
earlier<00:00:28.710> well<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.279> wires<00:00:29.429> come<00:00:29.730> down<00:00:29.910> and

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
earlier well the wires come down and

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.490 
earlier well the wires come down and
they<00:00:30.330> plug<00:00:30.599> into<00:00:30.750> that<00:00:30.929> connector<00:00:31.380> the

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
they plug into that connector the

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.620 
they plug into that connector the
connectors<00:00:31.890> in<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.099> Box<00:00:32.450> connected<00:00:33.450> up<00:00:33.540> to

play<00:00:52.860> into<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.309> battery<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.820> batteries

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
play into the battery so the batteries

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.000 
play into the battery so the batteries
get<00:00:54.210> stored<00:00:54.570> in<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.989> box<00:00:55.170> or<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.620> shed<00:00:55.829> that

you saw earlier we go on the back of the

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.900 
you saw earlier we go on the back of the
tiny<00:00:57.719> house<00:00:57.930> as<00:00:58.140> does<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.770> entire<00:00:59.039> system<00:00:59.609> all

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
tiny house as does the entire system all

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.580 
tiny house as does the entire system all
the<00:01:00.210> way<00:01:00.270> have<00:01:00.329> approved<00:01:00.660> all<00:01:00.809> ventilated<00:01:01.469> as

the way have approved all ventilated as
well<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:02.430> it's<00:01:02.550> not<00:01:02.579> going<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.850> overheat<00:01:03.030> and

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
well so it's not going to overheat and

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.960 
well so it's not going to overheat and
there<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.350> fan<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.220> there's<00:01:05.369> not<00:01:05.489> silent

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
there is a fan and there's not silent

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.429 
there is a fan and there's not silent
running<00:01:06.119> but<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.420> won't<00:01:06.570> hear<00:01:06.750> on<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.080> inside

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
running but you won't hear on the inside

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.399 
running but you won't hear on the inside
that's<00:01:08.430> guaranteed<00:01:08.700> but<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.049> system

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
that's guaranteed but that is the system

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.399 
that's guaranteed but that is the system
itself<00:01:10.680> now<00:01:10.920> here<00:01:13.700> for<00:01:14.700> your<00:01:14.790> three<00:01:14.939> pin<00:01:15.119> plugs

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
itself now here for your three pin plugs

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:16.670 
itself now here for your three pin plugs
yeah

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
yeah

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.950 
yeah
you<00:01:16.979> can<00:01:17.159> plug<00:01:17.369> straight<00:01:17.700> in<00:01:17.850> all<00:01:18.180> this<00:01:18.750> will

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
you can plug straight in all this will

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.929 
you can plug straight in all this will
be<00:01:19.020> hardwired<00:01:19.530> straight<00:01:20.369> into<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.729> tiny

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
be hardwired straight into the tiny

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.240 
be hardwired straight into the tiny
house<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:22.049> can<00:01:22.380> actually<00:01:22.619> have<00:01:23.189> your

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
house so you can actually have your

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.130 
house so you can actually have your
power<00:01:23.610> directly<00:01:24.240> in<00:01:24.330> there<00:01:24.450> we've<00:01:24.630> got<00:01:24.750> four

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
power directly in there we've got four

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.230 
power directly in there we've got four
or<00:01:25.170> five<00:01:25.350> mark<00:01:26.159> how<00:01:26.280> many<00:01:26.340> double<00:01:26.970> sockets

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
or five mark how many double sockets

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.219 
or five mark how many double sockets
with<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.479> one<00:01:28.549> so<00:01:29.549> in<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.960> four<00:01:30.960> double

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
with that one so in the four double

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:39.080 
with that one so in the four double
sockets<00:01:37.130> so<00:01:38.130> each<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.340> these<00:01:38.640> are<00:01:38.700> going<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.000> be

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
sockets so each of these are going to be

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.480 
sockets so each of these are going to be
individually<00:01:39.630> wired<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.500> different

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
individually wired to the different

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.319 
individually wired to the different
points<00:01:42.950> lovely<00:01:43.979> which<00:01:44.549> gives<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.299> a

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
points lovely which gives you a

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.670 
points lovely which gives you a
completely<00:01:45.720> independent<00:01:45.869> living<00:01:46.259> so<00:01:46.439> things

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
completely independent living so things

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.840 
completely independent living so things
can<00:01:46.829> be<00:01:46.920> turned<00:01:47.070> off<00:01:47.310> so<00:01:47.369> you're<00:01:47.579> not<00:01:47.670> wasting

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
can be turned off so you're not wasting

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.480 
can be turned off so you're not wasting
the<00:01:48.119> electricity<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.200> really<00:01:49.409> is<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.920> the

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
the electricity and it really is the the

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.830 
the electricity and it really is the the
catalyst<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:52.430> low<00:01:53.430> impact<00:01:53.759> living<00:01:54.119> what

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
catalyst of the low impact living what

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.910 
catalyst of the low impact living what
marks<00:01:55.110> thing<00:01:55.229> here<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.619> shown<00:01:55.770> how<00:01:55.890> to

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
marks thing here is you shown how to

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.130 
marks thing here is you shown how to
connect<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.280> batteries<00:01:56.579> together

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.900 

has<00:02:02.140> come<00:02:02.380> out<00:02:02.470> a<00:02:02.560> little<00:02:02.680> bit<00:02:02.890> so<00:02:03.040> you<00:02:03.130> see

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.280 

I've<00:02:06.910> got<00:02:07.090> my<00:02:07.120> own<00:02:07.330> female<00:02:07.720> couplings<00:02:08.170> that

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.290 
I've got my own female couplings that

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:15.870 
I've got my own female couplings that
you<00:02:08.470> can't<00:02:08.680> get<00:02:08.830> confused<00:02:09.280> on<00:02:09.430> these<00:02:14.760> so<00:02:15.760> that

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
you can't get confused on these so that

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.790 
you can't get confused on these so that
is<00:02:16.210> now<00:02:16.330> coming<00:02:16.630> on<00:02:16.870> it's<00:02:17.140> now<00:02:17.230> quick<00:02:17.500> that<00:02:17.650> is

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
is now coming on it's now quick that is

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.100 
is now coming on it's now quick that is
it<00:02:18.010> really<00:02:18.250> is<00:02:18.580> that<00:02:18.730> simple<00:02:18.790> plug<00:02:19.570> and<00:02:19.600> play

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
it really is that simple plug and play

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.990 
it really is that simple plug and play
so<00:02:20.380> easy<00:02:20.590> my<00:02:20.920> aunt<00:02:21.130> you<00:02:21.280> could<00:02:21.430> do<00:02:21.550> it<00:02:21.670> I<00:02:21.760> think

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
so easy my aunt you could do it I think

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.470 
so easy my aunt you could do it I think
she<00:02:22.180> might<00:02:22.810> well<00:02:23.020> do<00:02:23.200> it<00:02:23.320> when<00:02:23.440> she<00:02:23.590> sees<00:02:23.770> this

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
she might well do it when she sees this

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.700 
she might well do it when she sees this
here<00:02:25.480> we<00:02:25.570> go<00:02:25.690> and<00:02:25.900> then<00:02:26.020> on<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.230> screen<00:02:26.350> there

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
here we go and then on the screen there

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.770 
here we go and then on the screen there
the<00:02:26.920> lights<00:02:27.580> and<00:02:27.760> show<00:02:27.910> you<00:02:27.970> I'm<00:02:28.480> not<00:02:28.630> sure

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
the lights and show you I'm not sure

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:29.850 
the lights and show you I'm not sure
what<00:02:28.900> I'm<00:02:28.960> looking<00:02:28.990> at<00:02:29.200> here<00:02:29.350> first<00:02:29.530> of<00:02:29.740> all

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
what I'm looking at here first of all

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.320 
what I'm looking at here first of all
you<00:02:30.010> look<00:02:30.130> at<00:02:30.280> the<00:02:30.460> output<00:02:31.060> from<00:02:31.090> the

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
you look at the output from the

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.410 
you look at the output from the
batteries<00:02:31.780> so<00:02:32.490> that's<00:02:33.490> there's<00:02:34.150> no<00:02:34.240> input

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
batteries so that's there's no input

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.000 
batteries so that's there's no input
coming<00:02:34.810> in<00:02:34.900> at<00:02:34.990> the<00:02:35.050> moment<00:02:35.200> now<00:02:35.440> if<00:02:35.680> it's<00:02:35.890> not

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
coming in at the moment now if it's not

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.440 
coming in at the moment now if it's not
plugged<00:02:36.190> in<00:02:36.430> I'm<00:02:36.850> not<00:02:36.970> going<00:02:37.180> to<00:02:37.270> scroll

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
plugged in I'm not going to scroll

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.610 
plugged in I'm not going to scroll
through<00:02:37.510> this<00:02:37.840> at<00:02:37.990> the<00:02:38.080> moment<00:02:38.170> because<00:02:38.470> I

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
through this at the moment because I

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.870 
through this at the moment because I
haven't<00:02:38.770> looked<00:02:38.980> at<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.130> instruction<00:02:39.580> manual

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
haven't looked at the instruction manual

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.220 
haven't looked at the instruction manual
myself<00:02:40.180> because<00:02:40.570> I<00:02:40.660> don't<00:02:40.720> know<00:02:40.990> what<00:02:41.140> I'm

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
myself because I don't know what I'm

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.390 
myself because I don't know what I'm
gonna<00:02:41.320> be<00:02:41.470> looking<00:02:41.590> at<00:02:41.800> on<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:41.950> screen<00:02:41.980> but

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
gonna be looking at on the screen but

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.130 
gonna be looking at on the screen but
everything<00:02:42.850> you<00:02:43.600> see<00:02:43.750> all<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:43.900> different

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
everything you see all the different

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.630 
everything you see all the different
outputs<00:02:44.350> how<00:02:44.680> much<00:02:44.830> is<00:02:45.010> charging<00:02:45.400> what<00:02:45.550> the

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
outputs how much is charging what the

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.430 
outputs how much is charging what the
panels<00:02:45.940> are<00:02:46.060> producing<00:02:46.480> how<00:02:46.960> much<00:02:47.140> has<00:02:47.290> left

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
panels are producing how much has left

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.410 
panels are producing how much has left
in<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:47.680> battery<00:02:48.070> I'm<00:02:48.820> not<00:02:49.030> sure<00:02:49.150> if<00:02:49.240> you<00:02:49.300> can

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
in the battery I'm not sure if you can

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.360 
in the battery I'm not sure if you can
see<00:02:49.540> how<00:02:49.720> much<00:02:49.870> you've<00:02:50.050> used<00:02:50.080> but<00:02:51.010> you<00:02:51.070> can<00:02:51.220> see

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
see how much you've used but you can see

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.860 
see how much you've used but you can see
how<00:02:51.550> much<00:02:51.730> is<00:02:51.910> actually<00:02:52.240> left<00:02:52.390> in<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.630> battery

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
how much is actually left in the battery

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:53.190 
how much is actually left in the battery
as<00:02:52.959> well

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
as well

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.590 
as well
all<00:02:53.350> from<00:02:53.620> scrolling<00:02:54.070> through<00:02:57.060> yeah<00:02:58.060> 25

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
all from scrolling through yeah 25

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.150 
all from scrolling through yeah 25
percent<00:02:59.170> or<00:02:59.290> whatever<00:02:59.590> up<00:02:59.770> to<00:02:59.920> a<00:02:59.950> hundred

percent<00:03:00.490> that<00:03:00.730> effectively<00:03:01.690> tells<00:03:02.050> you<00:03:02.200> what

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
percent that effectively tells you what

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.860 
percent that effectively tells you what
you're<00:03:02.620> drawing<00:03:02.800> at<00:03:03.130> the<00:03:03.160> time<00:03:03.400> so<00:03:03.790> from<00:03:04.570> zero

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
you're drawing at the time so from zero

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.420 
you're drawing at the time so from zero
to<00:03:05.140> twenty<00:03:05.380> five<00:03:05.530> percent<00:03:05.739> these<00:03:06.100> are<00:03:06.250> the

to twenty five percent these are the
nothing<00:03:06.850> walk<00:03:07.090> up<00:03:07.330> to<00:03:07.510> 25<00:03:07.959> percent<00:03:08.290> if<00:03:09.040> you're

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
nothing walk up to 25 percent if you're

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.270 
nothing walk up to 25 percent if you're
right<00:03:09.459> up<00:03:09.640> to<00:03:09.790> 75<00:03:10.360> to<00:03:10.870> 100<00:03:11.230> percent<00:03:11.560> you've<00:03:12.130> got

right up to 75 to 100 percent you've got

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.680 
right up to 75 to 100 percent you've got
lots<00:03:12.520> o<00:03:12.730> I<00:03:12.820> mean<00:03:13.030> you're<00:03:13.150> putting<00:03:13.300> a<00:03:13.480> lot<00:03:13.660> of

really handy know someone's people have

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.350 
really handy know someone's people have
seen<00:03:17.920> a<00:03:17.950> few<00:03:18.250> things<00:03:18.280> in<00:03:18.790> that<00:03:18.880> a<00:03:18.940> few<00:03:19.120> times

got it let's say we had a harvester
built<00:04:52.860> on<00:04:52.979> the<00:04:53.040> back<00:04:53.190> here<00:04:53.370> somewhere<00:04:53.760> or<00:04:54.150> if

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
built on the back here somewhere or if

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.730 
built on the back here somewhere or if
it<00:04:54.360> was<00:04:54.570> static<00:04:54.750> in<00:04:55.020> someone's<00:04:55.320> house<00:04:55.470> and

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
not filters in and maybe chemicals to

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.909 
not filters in and maybe chemicals to
clean<00:04:59.760> the<00:04:59.880> water<00:05:00.080> how<00:05:01.080> are<00:05:01.500> we<00:05:01.590> gonna<00:05:01.650> get<00:05:01.860> the

clean the water how are we gonna get the
water<00:05:02.040> up<00:05:02.370> there<00:05:02.520> because<00:05:02.940> I<00:05:02.970> always<00:05:03.390> fall

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
water up there because I always fall

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:12.890 
water up there because I always fall
that<00:05:03.780> water<00:05:03.960> flows<00:05:04.229> downhill<00:05:11.660> which<00:05:12.660> it<00:05:12.780> all

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
that water flows downhill which it all

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:24.620 
that water flows downhill which it all
works<00:05:13.169> direct<00:05:13.800> from<00:05:23.210> where<00:05:24.210> does<00:05:24.360> the<00:05:24.479> waste

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
works direct from where does the waste

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:25.820
