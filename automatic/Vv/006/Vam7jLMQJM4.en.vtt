00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 you will see house architecture and 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.970
 construction offering ceramics flame 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:13.519
 block and structural channels 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.519
 access the site called dot com. 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.750
 hello staff are welcome to the frame 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.160
 house architecture building today 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.510
 following the suggestion of some 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.280
 viewers 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.559
 Let's introduce you to one more item 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.150
 sustainable development for the construction 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.739
 of rainwater reuse 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.260
 the technique of reuse of rainwater 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.059
 to collect water normally through 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.489
 of the roof rails and stored in a 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.890
 reservoir for use in 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.790
 are as potable for cleaning Fizi 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.790
 plant irrigation 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.250
 there are several ways to accomplish this 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.170
 most traditional system is 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.760
 carried out many times in urban lots 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.160
 and provides for the installation of a reservoir 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.110
 buried water that receives rainfall from 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.729
 gravity and through the system of 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.710
 pumping takes water to a 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.540
 Exclusive upper reservoir 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.729
 this end which distributes water for 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.500
 gravity at various points of the house served 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.619
 including for discharge into the vessels 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.619
 toilets 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.550
 but with the evolution of the 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.100
 system there is a simpler technique 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.750
 and consists of a raised reservoir and 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.270
 more compact like the one we are 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.460
 using the house design to clean and 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.860
 In this case, the reservoir will 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.630
 and will not require pumping of 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.090
 because the reservoir itself has 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.130
 faucets which eliminates the use of energy 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.180
 with the movement and minimizes the 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.180
 system installation course 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.259
 the system comes practical it has a 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.030
 water inlet at the top 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:58.130
 you can even separate the sheets and 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.200
 other exits as for cleaning and 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.540
 extravasor that eliminates excess water 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.520
 also as we said this water can 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.170
 be used to compose the system of 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.000
 irrigation of the house garden 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.380
 in this case as not always the 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.690
 Constant rainwater supply 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.970
 you can install a small book 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.110
 in the tank that detects 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.750
 when the reservoir water level 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.459
 is low and complete with the minimum 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.500
 needed water from the utility 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.500
 supplying the irrigation system 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.600
 I hope you have enjoyed it more 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.510
