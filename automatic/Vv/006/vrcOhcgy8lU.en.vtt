00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:12.339
 of the best games released mega brazil always enters the list at least one 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:15.879
 of these two classics launched at the beginning of the consortium's life, 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:17.280
 suffered a committee today 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.320
 the northern contact quartet 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.400
 these are just examples of how to make a good platform game 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.169
 but also how to use a license in a decent way 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:29.550
 which at that time was no longer very common 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.120
 there is the little-known game that also took over these two 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.830
 called a new conflict 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.290
 were in the apartment 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.290
 the tattoo artist 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.850
 developed by the initiative 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.609
 the subdivision of the series that made christopher hill of goal of martyr 

00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:59.230
 the celestino sees these games of money 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.020
 the gamer a platform game that puts you in control on Sunday 20 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.350
 and this is more or less so 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.780
 while they were training with a magic show 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.120
 the owner of mysterious morning art 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.760
 to enter it to give a nudge it ends up falling in there disappearing 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.830
 the mic then go right behind your friend and so the two end up getting into 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.010
 another dimension 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.620
 and a mysterious voice then defies cdc in gauchÃ£o its magical powers and 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.620
 that's where the challenge palm trees 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.299
 to what extent the possibility of choosing where Nikkei is the owner of a 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.660
 single player mode 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.590
 while the phases both adventures are similar 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.320
 some internal differences I started in the third stage 2d can not pass 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.759
 by the very large drain 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.229
 so he has to go back over the place where mickey has gone 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.920
 space for everything is much more difficult 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.070
 and the enemies are smarter and does it requires a little more 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.400
 player agility 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.400
 how they are seeing 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.479
 still you can finish at least half an hour each character if you 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.479
 are very skilled 

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:15.829
 the controls are very simple the circle 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:18.250
 the bea not only the most part because the agreement 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.959
 the essential command for the phases that sometimes get a bit 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.289
 the long one if you walk at normal speed 

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:25.419
 But it's also no use running. 

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:28.419
 since it has several enemies and platforms to propose it during the stage 

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:34.749
 tea 

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:40.530
 although it seems unusual 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.969
 there is still talk of two player mode 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:45.260
 playing with friends with whom you expose yourself 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.990
 and it is a greater number of phases that increases the difficulty to can favor 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.999
 heart 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:53.889
 In addition, their design changes so that players can 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:54.949
 cooperative 

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:57.949
 starts practically has to throw away everyone up 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:02.269
 eight months everything has to pull the dollar because of the new leader 

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:07.379
 the experience makes it very fun and operates in online mode as the 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.699
 game was a slower pace that favors exploration of the case the acronym 

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:11.749
 the sun 

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:14.749
 ae 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:20.680
 Are they fantastic? 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.869
 at the level of the previous games of the series b 

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:26.589
 extradition toros well animated and with excellent level of detail 

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:29.369
 the only setback is that some scenarios seem to have things a little 

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:33.479
 but this can easily be compensated for by the high level of detail 

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:35.249
 that they have 

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:38.769
 unfortunately the games that present a few moments during the game 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.789
 especially for two players but nothing that gets annoying 

00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:44.330
 the sound is also very good 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.249
 only two balls in the game when mickey the owner of constructive uses 

00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:51.249
 moreira 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:53.589
 bad 

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:55.469
 already the sound effects are very common 

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:57.359
 even those that are well-anticipated 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:00.359
 Do you go out there this month? 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.539
 wake up flow could be considered a classic as much as the luck factor 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:47.770
 what suffered 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.330
 but unfortunately ended up being overshadowed by other mega-drive games that were 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.699
 released in the same year 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:55.400
 the servers registered at the front 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.129
 although it is a bit short 

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:00.350
 their dvd for several plays even after they have gone wrong 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.870
 It is a quality game mainly with children 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.760
 our difficulty and by the cooperative way
