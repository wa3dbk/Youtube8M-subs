00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
similar to human we went to r2 we

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.549 
similar to human we went to r2 we
increase<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.700> we<00:00:48.239> increased<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.170> speed

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
increase that we increased it the speed

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.400 
increase that we increased it the speed
at<00:00:49.710> which<00:00:49.739> we<00:00:50.039> could<00:00:50.360> perform<00:00:51.360> tasks<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.320> we

at which we could perform tasks and we

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.200 
at which we could perform tasks and we

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
increase the level of dexterity so that

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.270
