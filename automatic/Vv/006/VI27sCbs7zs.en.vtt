the enjoyment of the whole game it is
very<00:05:59.820> enjoyable<00:06:00.270> but<00:06:00.750> it<00:06:00.990> is<00:06:01.110> short<00:06:01.440> that's

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:01.949 
very enjoyable but it is short that's

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:05.060 
very enjoyable but it is short that's
the<00:06:02.250> that's<00:06:02.580> the<00:06:02.729> worst<00:06:03.000> part<00:06:03.150> in<00:06:04.070> fracture

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.070 
the that's the worst part in fracture

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.279 
the that's the worst part in fracture
because<00:06:05.280> it<00:06:05.580> is<00:06:05.789> very<00:06:05.850> short<00:06:06.360> it's<00:06:06.840> not<00:06:07.110> too

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:07.289 
because it is very short it's not too

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:11.749 
because it is very short it's not too
long<00:06:08.870> but<00:06:09.870> this<00:06:10.380> is<00:06:10.500> not<00:06:10.590> a<00:06:10.650> problem<00:06:10.979> if<00:06:11.580> you

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:11.759 
long but this is not a problem if you

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:14.360 
long but this is not a problem if you
