 finally so this is what we think 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:02:02.660

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.760
 events well to the third position there is 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.530

 something that falls into the pocketpc mouth 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:44.790

 talk to you about it and when you believe of 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.730
 see it the more there is a situation there 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.290
 an expression of various people come 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.690
 someone from the back recognizes him friend 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.520
 my know him I made a surprise no 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.790

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.790
 eyes 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:25.880
 thanks doesn't make much sense like 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.850
 however, we think it's right 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.280
 fill the world with useless missions 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:33.620
 2013 sprintoso there is a beautiful dream 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.960
 beautiful sun there are friends there 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.060
 that nature is said to do it for free 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.430
 20 beats to respect the nature leila 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.320
 of tuscania m plans we that we do of 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.390
 turkey and let's go back do now not to 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:50.360
 all ended up too pretty girls and 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:53.600
 upset and with the barrels the plan said 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:57.440
 hunchback is the best answer but the 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.840
 patriarch of Constantinople via the peer 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.700
 even to the states also hunger that does that 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.830
 writes the patriarch of 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.170
 Constantinople writing to whom 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:15.350
 writes cela twitter the patriarch of 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:17.810
 Constantinople and therefore nothing ends 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:21.850
 so I wish someone wants to come and do 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.850
 a sleight of hand here 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:35.570
 mined from afar 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.920
