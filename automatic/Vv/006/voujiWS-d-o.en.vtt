00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:36.440

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.800
 the sentence 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.350
 It's just me, my mouth, I'm 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.930
 I'm feeling a phrase that we do not 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.979
 won at the time we can not be 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:18.750

 all the graphics in the world because it is 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:33.540
 short is that it is accurate 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:35.369
 believe that this is what this is like 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.560

 I do not know when to book. 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.320
 so so very objective and I loved that 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.360
 and the question is you 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:51.149
 was there out of curiosity what I 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:53.270
 I think you are what you attribute to 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.580
 right book recognition to 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.800
 curiosity or a necessity even when 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.860
 I care gabriel alone and did like it 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.600
 information is taken care of by Gabriel 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.530

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.520
 and had one more thing 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.560
 the averages and then it's cool it's cool to people 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:22.190
 holds much more the science of a thing 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:26.270

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.980
 tell me the strength if it's necessary 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:38.300
 I did not once want a ghost in the 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:41.030
 because young people are already aware 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:44.810

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:57.620

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.610

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.470
 that God is who you speak the 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.230
 things that the person was once 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.959

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.450
 that leaves us closer and May is 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.510

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.160

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.790
 Monaco's most beautiful work in the world 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.010
 but I improved then anyone who 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.900
 exercised at home with the pressure was still 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.540

 moments that someone's life 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:04.050

 He did not make a kid out of it. 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.920
 started asking you to make a clear 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:16.030
 What do you make a book of your experience? 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:19.389

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:29.440
 this improvement so he did not see me in 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:31.510
 Larger week I think that everything 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.270
 world can see if it can identify 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.520
 I'm interested in talking about amazon needs 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.070

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.910
 have access to information that is very 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:45.730
 Cheap as came from Brazilian view but 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:48.190
 I like to feel if I was going to make a 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:52.000
 easy magazine language everyone reads 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:56.950
 if you realize me it's not boring because 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:02.500
 It was there and pick up also shows how to do it 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:06.760
 it's 88 cleans up what I do 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:08.440
 there I forgot port souvenir 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.200
 asking everything ready 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:15.970
 I got ready here I'm going to do it now. 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:18.280
 American help again has a 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:21.190
 chapter on support and after I feel 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:24.460
 about diseases and injuries in 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:27.700
 when she wants to know that there is sc 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.960
 which is that healthy and then so I 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:32.470
 I 'm not like that 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:35.260
 That's it, four albums and then I did one 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.600
 coke went behind the other then 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:40.750
 That's why it always goes to children. 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:43.990
 I think it's good and until then we have two 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:47.020
 wonderful journalists with her who does 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:49.180
 my soccer site that my daughter was 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.830
 loose right 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.230
 and still had 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.250
 the mother who was very cool level does not have 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:57.400
 children 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.620
 I'm young 2010 so maybe good 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:03.040
 figure out what you want, we'll go 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.700
 she asked if she was going with two 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.250
 children 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:08.770
 so she already knows a lot against 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:13.050
 the issue was a very 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:16.950
 legal and two years collecting that I 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:27.100
 I accept paulo does her blog 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:31.180
 canton's sensational blog is very very 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:33.970
 Good if you want to know if the government is 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:36.910
 great to do to quote the institution and 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:39.970
 then you look at the conditions on the arrival of 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:43.120
 child is knowing who this is, there it is 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:45.730
 thinking the top gun husband wants to know 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.240
 Why they want is a sadness but the 

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:50.630
 great poet 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:53.810
 and I'm still learning that it was snow 

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:54.710
 radios portal information is a lot 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.669
 has changed 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:07:00.650
 So that's what's cool and we're staying 

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:03.139

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:05.470
