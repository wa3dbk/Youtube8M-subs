00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.220
 So here is a little tutorial for you 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.170
 actually show for those who have a 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.300
 laguna to it 9 dci a lot I saw on 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.100
 forums that have cure that has had the 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.930
 seeing a gesture of lava diagnosis 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.480
 blinking motor and the car that 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.680
 stops on the road send the breakdown 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.820
 partially troubleshoot since the pana 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.170
 the kingdom needs are now 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.360
 you still have to renault for 10 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.240
 with adil face to face at the level of 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.570
 calculator but the fault I 'm going to you 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.570
 show it 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.750
 So here we sure 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.280
 for the under the bonnet so that's 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.640
 the electric etching pump that is 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.820
 here with the diesel inlet hoses 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.010
 so there is a nut underneath you 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.190
 pass all his plastic films 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.040
 fuel conduit in the initial phase 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.839
 filters to unplug them that's 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.300
 disconnect it is easily done in a 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:58.739
 ten minutes was done is in 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.600
 did minus mine typed on it 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.949
 went away the fact is that the first 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.870
 once I had broken down it was done 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.369
 at the stop so it did not see that 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.020
 it's not at all we do not have at all 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.000
 I say it was that you see the 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.590
 Hungary with the two 3 year old sons to 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.119
 those of the branches from here actually served as 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.550
 cut the threads so that when 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.840
 redeem you a propaganda to and if 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.630
 it was the old one so I had to 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.729
 put my pipe back in and out 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.869
 departure of diesel I disconnected the plug 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.670
 because I had recovered one before 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.479
 to break it will still display too 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.160
 So when I looked because 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.179
 So you're not good so, I 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.110
 Recovered displays like that that's them 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:29.330
 shots of 13 that you find in 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.880
 underneath because in fact to pump go 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:36.140
 concretely like that 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.130
 the car either you take off the elastic 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.500
 either you remove the shots of 13 and 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.920
 you rubber in east 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.840
 So now that I mine it 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.090
 is troubleshoot she starts he rolls her 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.959
 is concluded since I exchanged two 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.739
 time because the first was 

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:54.440
 defective is celebrating 

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:56.759
 after if it does not happen on the road 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.450
 well, it's better for you to avoid kelkal and 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.170
 and then worry now if that 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.929
 you arrive on the road 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.459
 it will go out and not restart 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:07.560
 so here we are on an ipod and it's a 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:12.090
 renault you remove 3 etc road the 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:14.160
 big bay cache 2 and 3 that removes this 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.520
 case the plastic to remove it must 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.120
 remove sketches here from the liquid of 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.340
 power steering 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.959
 I passed them here because I 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.660
 did not know for the cap there is one 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:27.420
 it withdrew after he gets up from there and that 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.950
 it goes out to the bow to the left of the 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.209
 vehicle 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.440
 according to just remove the pipes 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.080
 that must be disconnected on the island 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.540
 leblanc you press on each side 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.530
 you turn it history the rest the 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.940
 pump she comes to follow him 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.410
 this way you have two more here so 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:48.190
 the green and the yellow withdrew that they are 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:51.910
 so here it is I should have done the 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.620
 video before going back up but that's so 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.540
 the trouble was that for me it's 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.700
 restarted a pump in action on e-bay 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:02.260
 you can find one at 45.50 euros 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.430
 a top from 55 euros in case of 45 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.630
 euros you can find what I 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.610
 had two months was defective but 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.830
 I did not know and it can work 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.340
 reach more than 200 to 300 euros 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.300
 so that's good luck anyway it's 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.830
 do not bother to go home 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.069
 a mechanic for that unless you have 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.269
 as I see it on the dashboard 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.519
 because here I'm going to have to lead this one 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.560
 for whom the al harra branch 10 for 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:25.900
 to erase the mistake in any case 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.150
 test it is 3 5 6 repair and I 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.470
 no more worries so she is a plus to 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.019
 the share of rich prime engine speed 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.690
 to get it going again I forgot a 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.730
 little detail if you had it on the 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.769
 road this breakdown there or not elsewhere 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.670
 if there is more turf with the finish meets 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.670
 so necessarily read brands 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:51.659
 the inspectors five to six times but 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:52.170
 without has started its going to prime the pump's 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:54.719
 theirs are you going to hear it 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.310
 electronically and once where does 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:57.689
 five six times there you can look for a 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.359
 element to start the vehicle with the 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:02.010
 map normally so if it does not work 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.689
 first try twice twice 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.349
 three times but usually that 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:06.349
 does it work again
