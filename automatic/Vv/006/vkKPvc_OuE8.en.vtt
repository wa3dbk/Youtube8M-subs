00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
it's in the key of C but we're in

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.479 
it's in the key of C but we're in
standard<00:00:50.360> G<00:00:50.510> tuning<00:00:50.720> there's<00:00:51.199> no<00:00:51.410> Capo's<00:00:51.920> that

standard G tuning there's no Capo's that

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:54.070 
standard G tuning there's no Capo's that
means<00:00:52.699> we<00:00:52.790> have<00:00:52.879> to<00:00:53.030> play<00:00:53.210> off<00:00:53.360> the<00:00:53.510> key<00:00:53.690> of<00:00:53.840> C

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
and very often what happens when we do

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.910 
and very often what happens when we do
that<00:00:56.239> is<00:00:56.390> we<00:00:56.540> have<00:00:56.570> to<00:00:56.840> use<00:00:56.960> our<00:00:57.080> pinkie<00:00:57.530> a<00:00:57.680> lot

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
speed the same speed that I played it

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:40.929 
speed the same speed that I played it
then<00:01:39.200> ten<00:01:39.740> beats<00:01:39.920> slower<00:01:40.250> and<00:01:40.520> Tim<00:01:40.760> beats

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
then ten beats slower and Tim beats

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:43.000 
then ten beats slower and Tim beats
slower<00:01:41.270> than<00:01:41.869> that<00:01:41.900> and<00:01:42.229> also<00:01:42.590> played<00:01:42.860> it

Capo<00:02:04.420> so<00:02:04.479> that<00:02:04.719> means<00:02:04.930> that<00:02:05.049> we're<00:02:05.170> going<00:02:05.619> to

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
Capo so that means that we're going to

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.190 
Capo so that means that we're going to
have<00:02:05.890> to<00:02:06.009> play<00:02:06.189> out<00:02:06.430> of<00:02:06.549> a<00:02:06.640> C<00:02:06.960> position<00:02:07.960> and

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
have to play out of a C position and

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.839 
have to play out of a C position and
what<00:02:08.410> that<00:02:08.560> forces<00:02:09.069> you<00:02:09.190> to<00:02:09.220> do<00:02:09.489> a<00:02:09.520> lot

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 
what that forces you to do a lot

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:11.550 
what that forces you to do a lot
whenever<00:02:10.270> you're<00:02:10.420> playing<00:02:10.630> on<00:02:10.750> C<00:02:11.020> position<00:02:11.410> it

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
whenever you're playing on C position it

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.009 
whenever you're playing on C position it
forces<00:02:12.220> you<00:02:12.340> to<00:02:12.370> have<00:02:12.519> to<00:02:12.849> use<00:02:13.120> your<00:02:13.330> pinky<00:02:13.810> in

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
forces you to have to use your pinky in

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.410 
forces you to have to use your pinky in
in<00:02:14.290> an<00:02:14.650> independent<00:02:15.069> manner<00:02:15.610> so<00:02:16.090> that's<00:02:16.300> our

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
in an independent manner so that's our

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.180 
in an independent manner so that's our
dual<00:02:16.630> purpose<00:02:17.080> for<00:02:17.260> this<00:02:17.349> lesson<00:02:17.560> not<00:02:17.800> only<00:02:18.040> to

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
dual purpose for this lesson not only to

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.009 
dual purpose for this lesson not only to
learn<00:02:18.280> a<00:02:18.340> version<00:02:18.580> of<00:02:18.760> Wildwood<00:02:18.970> flower<00:02:19.060> but

learn a version of Wildwood flower but
also<00:02:20.230> to<00:02:20.470> get<00:02:20.709> more<00:02:20.890> proficient<00:02:21.099> at<00:02:21.700> using<00:02:21.760> our

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
also to get more proficient at using our

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.320 
also to get more proficient at using our
pinkie<00:02:22.660> particularly<00:02:23.319> on<00:02:23.500> this<00:02:23.650> low<00:02:24.010> D<00:02:24.849> string

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330

pinkie particularly on this low D string
okay<00:02:25.870> that's<00:02:26.319> what<00:02:26.470> we're<00:02:26.590> doing<00:02:26.769> today<00:02:26.860> so

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
okay that's what we're doing today so

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.290 
okay that's what we're doing today so
let's<00:02:27.310> go<00:02:27.400> ahead<00:02:27.519> and<00:02:27.610> throw<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.910> tab<00:02:28.120> up

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
let's go ahead and throw the tab up

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.479 
let's go ahead and throw the tab up
there<00:02:28.480> you'll<00:02:29.050> notice<00:02:29.290> as<00:02:29.680> with<00:02:30.040> all<00:02:30.190> my<00:02:30.280> banjo

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
there you'll notice as with all my banjo

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.370 
there you'll notice as with all my banjo
tabs<00:02:30.880> I<00:02:31.120> have<00:02:31.300> the<00:02:31.420> right<00:02:31.660> hand<00:02:31.930> fingers

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
tabs I have the right hand fingers

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.530 
tabs I have the right hand fingers
beneath<00:02:32.709> each<00:02:32.860> one<00:02:33.069> of<00:02:33.160> the<00:02:33.220> notes<00:02:33.430> so<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:34.269> T

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
beneath each one of the notes so the T

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.650 
beneath each one of the notes so the T
in<00:02:34.840> a<00:02:35.019> circle<00:02:35.380> will<00:02:35.500> be<00:02:35.790> one<00:02:36.790> would<00:02:37.000> stand<00:02:37.209> next

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
in a circle will be one would stand next

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.990 
in a circle will be one would stand next
to<00:02:37.930> its<00:02:38.349> star<00:02:38.560> for<00:02:38.980> middle<00:02:39.670> and<00:02:39.760> this<00:02:39.849> is<00:02:39.970> a

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
to its star for middle and this is a

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.580 
to its star for middle and this is a
very<00:02:40.269> basic<00:02:40.540> version<00:02:40.989> we're<00:02:41.290> going<00:02:41.410> to<00:02:41.470> use<00:02:41.560> a

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
very basic version we're going to use a

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.710 
very basic version we're going to use a
lot<00:02:41.830> of<00:02:41.950> what's<00:02:42.370> called<00:02:42.459> square<00:02:43.060> rolls<00:02:43.390> or

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
lot of what's called square rolls or

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.930 
lot of what's called square rolls or
mixed<00:02:44.650> rolls<00:02:44.860> and<00:02:45.160> that<00:02:45.280> just<00:02:45.489> simply<00:02:45.760> means

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
mixed rolls and that just simply means

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.820 
mixed rolls and that just simply means
that<00:02:46.000> we<00:02:46.150> start<00:02:46.450> with<00:02:46.569> our<00:02:46.720> thumb<00:02:47.019> we'll<00:02:47.680> play

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
that we start with our thumb we'll play

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.339 
that we start with our thumb we'll play
an<00:02:47.920> index<00:02:48.400> finger<00:02:48.610> play<00:02:49.360> another<00:02:49.660> thumb<00:02:50.019> and

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
an index finger play another thumb and

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:51.930 
an index finger play another thumb and
then<00:02:50.500> our<00:02:50.650> milk<00:02:50.890> and<00:02:51.160> we<00:02:51.489> do<00:02:51.610> that<00:02:51.760> on<00:02:51.910> all

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
then our milk and we do that on all

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.970 
then our milk and we do that on all
different<00:02:52.540> sorts<00:02:52.810> of<00:02:52.900> string<00:02:53.230> combinations

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
different sorts of string combinations

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.789 
different sorts of string combinations
but<00:02:54.160> if<00:02:54.430> you<00:02:54.549> use<00:02:54.670> that<00:02:54.910> pattern<00:02:55.799> that's

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
but if you use that pattern that's

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:58.589 
but if you use that pattern that's
called<00:02:57.099> a<00:02:57.190> mixed<00:02:57.519> roll<00:02:57.700> or<00:02:57.880> square<00:02:58.209> roll<00:02:58.390> I'll

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
called a mixed roll or square roll I'll

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.710 
called a mixed roll or square roll I'll
talk<00:02:58.840> more<00:02:58.870> about<00:02:59.380> that<00:02:59.680> in<00:03:00.069> my<00:03:00.640> rolls<00:03:01.030> lesson

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
talk more about that in my rolls lesson

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.630 
talk more about that in my rolls lesson
here<00:03:02.019> on<00:03:02.170> the<00:03:02.260> website<00:03:02.440> now<00:03:03.160> I<00:03:03.190> want<00:03:03.459> you<00:03:03.549> to

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
get started out of a basic C position

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:07.800 
get started out of a basic C position
we're<00:03:06.610> going<00:03:06.640> to<00:03:06.760> spend<00:03:07.000> a<00:03:07.060> lot<00:03:07.209> of<00:03:07.239> time<00:03:07.540> there

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
we're going to spend a lot of time there

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.960 
we're going to spend a lot of time there
because<00:03:07.989> we<00:03:08.109> are<00:03:08.140> in<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.440> key<00:03:08.590> of<00:03:08.620> C<00:03:08.859> so<00:03:09.010> that

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
because we are in the key of C so that

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.430 
because we are in the key of C so that
means<00:03:10.120> on<00:03:10.390> our<00:03:10.480> first<00:03:10.720> string<00:03:10.959> we're<00:03:11.200> playing

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
means on our first string we're playing

we're going to do it down on the lobe
4th<00:03:38.950> string<00:03:39.340> there<00:03:39.549> so<00:03:40.030> we<00:03:40.450> come<00:03:40.750> in<00:03:41.019> trying<00:03:41.680> to

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
4th string there so we come in trying to

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.559 
4th string there so we come in trying to
find<00:03:42.010> that<00:03:42.220> Wildwood<00:03:42.609> flower<00:03:42.639> melody<00:03:43.420> which

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.570 

and<00:03:49.140> that's<00:03:49.349> how<00:03:49.470> it<00:03:49.620> starts<00:03:50.099> we're<00:03:50.370> going<00:03:50.520> to

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
and that's how it starts we're going to

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.550 
and that's how it starts we're going to
kick<00:03:50.790> in<00:03:50.970> on<00:03:51.090> the<00:03:51.209> third<00:03:51.450> beat<00:03:51.690> of<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:52.530> first

okay so measures one and two together
sound<00:05:04.460> like<00:05:04.520> this<00:05:12.010> now<00:05:13.010> when<00:05:13.370> we<00:05:13.400> get<00:05:13.550> to

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
sound like this now when we get to

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.280 
sound like this now when we get to
measure<00:05:13.850> three<00:05:14.240> you're<00:05:14.420> going<00:05:14.510> to<00:05:14.600> go<00:05:14.690> back<00:05:14.990> to

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:02.450 
from start to finish even slower than

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:04.090 
from start to finish even slower than
we'll<00:06:02.690> do<00:06:02.780> it<00:06:02.870> here<00:06:03.050> as<00:06:03.230> well<00:06:03.470> as<00:06:03.800> all<00:06:03.950> the
