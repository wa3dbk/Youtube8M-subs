00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
open and it will be split up into five

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.039 
open and it will be split up into five
or<00:04:11.829> six<00:04:12.040> different<00:04:12.219> areas<00:04:12.999> much<00:04:13.659> like<00:04:13.900> i

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
or six different areas much like i

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:16.529 
or six different areas much like i
theorized<00:04:14.530> months<00:04:15.249> and<00:04:15.370> months<00:04:15.459> ago<00:04:15.790> so

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:16.539 
theorized months and months ago so

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:17.969 
theorized months and months ago so
perhaps<00:04:16.690> this<00:04:16.989> area<00:04:17.349> in<00:04:17.500> the<00:04:17.560> middle<00:04:17.590> here<00:04:17.829> is

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
perhaps this area in the middle here is

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:20.159 
perhaps this area in the middle here is
one<00:04:18.160> area<00:04:18.430> and<00:04:18.820> to<00:04:18.910> go<00:04:19.060> to<00:04:19.090> over<00:04:19.720> the<00:04:19.810> bridge<00:04:19.959> to

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
one area and to go to over the bridge to

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:21.990 
one area and to go to over the bridge to
