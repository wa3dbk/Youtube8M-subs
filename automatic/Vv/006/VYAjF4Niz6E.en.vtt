is<00:01:43.030> one<00:01:43.180> that<00:01:43.330> we<00:01:43.420> don't<00:01:43.659> see<00:01:43.869> so<00:01:44.049> much<00:01:44.170> anymore

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
is one that we don't see so much anymore

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.500

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
sixty three point nine for Tom just like

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.230 
sixty three point nine for Tom just like
the<00:02:02.650> previous<00:02:02.830> position<00:02:03.250> though<00:02:03.549> this<00:02:03.970> one

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
the previous position though this one

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.700 
the previous position though this one
doesn't<00:02:04.600> give<00:02:04.689> you<00:02:04.780> much<00:02:04.900> control<00:02:05.320> over<00:02:05.619> the

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
doesn't give you much control over the

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.520 
doesn't give you much control over the
bike<00:02:05.939> so<00:02:06.939> there<00:02:07.299> you<00:02:07.450> have<00:02:07.479> it<00:02:07.689> the<00:02:08.080> positions

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
bike so there you have it the positions

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.469 
bike so there you have it the positions
the<00:02:08.679> pros<00:02:08.920> are<00:02:09.490> faster<00:02:10.030> than<00:02:10.149> the<00:02:10.270> standard

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
the pros are faster than the standard

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.600 
the pros are faster than the standard
tuck<00:02:10.959> but<00:02:11.470> they<00:02:11.680> do<00:02:11.740> have<00:02:12.010> the<00:02:12.130> advantage<00:02:12.220> that

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
tuck but they do have the advantage that

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:13.290 
tuck but they do have the advantage that
they<00:02:12.880> are<00:02:12.970> on

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
they are on

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.510 
they are on
closed<00:02:13.480> roads<00:02:13.870> so<00:02:14.380> we'd<00:02:14.530> recommend<00:02:14.890> that<00:02:15.370> you

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
closed roads so we'd recommend that you

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.450 
closed roads so we'd recommend that you
don't<00:02:15.850> try<00:02:16.090> this<00:02:16.150> in<00:02:16.330> your<00:02:16.450> local<00:02:16.750> club<00:02:17.080> run<00:02:17.460> we

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
don't try this in your local club run we

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.970 
don't try this in your local club run we
all<00:02:18.580> know<00:02:18.990> screaming<00:02:19.990> behind<00:02:20.140> other<00:02:20.470> riders

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
all know screaming behind other riders

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.040 
all know screaming behind other riders
is<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.460> most<00:02:21.640> effective<00:02:22.300> way<00:02:22.480> of<00:02:22.750> going

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
is the most effective way of going

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.940 
is the most effective way of going
faster<00:02:23.740> with<00:02:24.070> less<00:02:24.310> effort<00:02:24.900> however<00:02:25.900> it<00:02:26.770> takes

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
faster with less effort however it takes

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.690 
faster with less effort however it takes
a<00:02:27.130> rider<00:02:27.370> it's<00:02:27.580> a<00:02:27.700> pretty<00:02:27.970> thick-skinned
