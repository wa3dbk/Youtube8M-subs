00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.820 
people I know they're saying this is
easy<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:14.700> then<00:00:14.850> the<00:00:15.110> brain<00:00:16.110> transplant<00:00:16.650> was

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
easy and then the brain transplant was

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.740 
easy and then the brain transplant was
hard<00:00:17.130> but<00:00:17.580> for<00:00:17.760> me<00:00:17.820> that<00:00:17.850> brain<00:00:18.210> transplant

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
hard but for me that brain transplant

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.000 
hard but for me that brain transplant
one<00:00:18.869> was<00:00:19.020> like<00:00:19.110> by<00:00:19.320> far<00:00:19.349> and<00:00:19.740> above<00:00:19.800> the

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
one was like by far and above the

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.070 
one was like by far and above the
easiest<00:00:20.340> in<00:00:20.520> this<00:00:20.640> game<00:00:20.820> if<00:00:21.420> that<00:00:21.720> was<00:00:21.900> what

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
easiest in this game if that was what

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.690 
easiest in this game if that was what
this<00:00:22.320> was<00:00:22.380> in<00:00:22.800> fucking<00:00:23.070> space<00:00:23.310> I<00:00:23.490> could<00:00:23.610> do

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:23.700 
this was in fucking space I could do

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.950 
this was in fucking space I could do
that<00:00:23.730> shit<00:00:24.090> with<00:00:24.180> my<00:00:24.270> hands<00:00:24.450> tied<00:00:24.660> behind<00:00:24.720> my

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.380 
that shit with my hands tied behind my
back<00:00:25.340> that<00:00:26.340> definitely<00:00:26.640> should<00:00:27.000> be<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.180> first

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
back that definitely should be the first

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.700 
back that definitely should be the first
one<00:00:27.539> in<00:00:27.630> my<00:00:27.750> opinion<00:00:28.020> because<00:00:28.230> that's<00:00:28.440> just

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
one in my opinion because that's just

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.460 
one in my opinion because that's just
super<00:00:29.250> easy<00:00:29.400> mode<00:00:29.670> I<00:00:29.699> don't<00:00:29.939> know<00:00:30.199> just<00:00:31.199> just

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
super easy mode I don't know just just

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.900 
super easy mode I don't know just just
get<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.740> laser<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.099> just<00:00:32.220> chop<00:00:32.400> them<00:00:32.460> up<00:00:32.669> and

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
get the laser and just chop them up and

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:41.299 
get the laser and just chop them up and
done<00:00:36.050> okay<00:00:37.050> stay<00:00:37.680> right<00:00:37.710> there<00:00:37.890> no<00:00:40.190> physics<00:00:41.190> of
