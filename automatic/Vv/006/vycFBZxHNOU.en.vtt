00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:19.080
 tutorial to make these beautiful 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:22.320
 vases with a glass and a balloon and a 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.810
 glass cup between thinner and girl 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.779
 be the base much better 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.210
 this is a model and the next one is this 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.780
 this base is a little fatter but 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.930
 it still works 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.820
 flowers whether they are real roses that you 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.079
 have given the desire and if you are for the ball 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.449
 There are little lies how are you and balloons 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.430
 of different colors the ones that you most 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:49.430
 like of course and a pair of scissors 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:59.750
 short is your balloon you remove the stick 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.090
 leaving a little bit and this part you're going to 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.070
 stretch with all your strength because 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.479
 it has to be very big this is going to 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.560
 cover the entire glass 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:11.990
 imagine then you stretch it a lot 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.300
 and since you stretched it you're going to 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.659
 take it you stretch it by putting your 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:21.950
 fingers inside and in this way in this 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:23.740
 position is going to be inserted covering the 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.220
 glass 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.290
 then you stretch it this way and 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:33.549
 you start on the base stretching 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:36.880
 too good until you reach the tip to 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:39.009
 the edge of the glass if it costs work 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.759
 you're going to fail a few times but 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:46.420
 It can be done as you can see 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:48.759
 your Sanson- style forces so you do not 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.280
 it is thus closed and fit very well your 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:54.369
 flower or your flowers you have to pull 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.039
 top down to start 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.230
 open the hole where your 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:03.230
 flowers 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:06.290
 finally you put the little flower 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.149
 so comfortable that they would be very cool and 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.700
 ready 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.400
 let's make the other glass design already 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.890
 do not stretch previously we put it by 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.650
 the base and we stretch up there I go very 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.840
 well here and I start having as my 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.740
 problems my hands start to shred 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:29.840
 It is with my fingers but believes 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:31.730
 do not believe it there they are and the hoyito just 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.940
 pinch masters down to be able to 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:38.210
 put our flower there on the side you see 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.660
 nicer and we put the little flower and 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.660
 ready
