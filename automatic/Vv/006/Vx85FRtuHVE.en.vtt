comes with a light tool bag and two

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.950 
comes with a light tool bag and two
batteries<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.939> 18<00:01:45.210> volt<00:01:45.390> batteries<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:45.930> a

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
batteries to 18 volt batteries and a

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.870 
batteries to 18 volt batteries and a
charger<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.590> one<00:01:46.680> thing<00:01:46.860> we<00:01:46.950> did<00:01:47.100> notice<00:01:47.280> if

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
charger and one thing we did notice if

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.490 
charger and one thing we did notice if
you<00:01:47.939> look<00:01:48.149> at<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.299> batteries<00:01:48.780> obviously

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
you look at the batteries obviously

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.920 
you look at the batteries obviously
they're<00:01:49.619> lithium<00:01:50.040> they're<00:01:50.220> very<00:01:50.430> light<00:01:50.930> these

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
they're lithium they're very light these

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.319 
they're lithium they're very light these
ones<00:01:52.140> are<00:01:52.290> low<00:01:52.470> profile<00:01:53.100> very<00:01:53.729> nice<00:01:53.970> when<00:01:54.210> I

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
ones are low profile very nice when I

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:00.950 
ones are low profile very nice when I
set<00:01:54.570> on<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.750> tool

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.290 

so<00:02:01.960> you<00:02:02.110> can<00:02:02.260> see<00:02:02.410> it's<00:02:02.560> low<00:02:02.740> profile<00:02:03.280> show<00:02:04.240> you

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
so you can see it's low profile show you

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.230 
so you can see it's low profile show you
the<00:02:04.600> light<00:02:04.780> system<00:02:05.200> so<00:02:05.230> much<00:02:05.530> powers<00:02:06.060> left<00:02:07.060> in

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
the light system so much powers left in

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.260 
the light system so much powers left in
the<00:02:07.330> battery<00:02:07.720> and<00:02:08.310> again<00:02:09.310> even<00:02:09.610> the<00:02:09.700> charge<00:02:10.030> is

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
the battery and again even the charge is

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.020 
the battery and again even the charge is
extremely<00:02:10.780> small<00:02:11.080> low<00:02:12.070> profile<00:02:12.580> doesn't<00:02:12.790> take

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
extremely small low profile doesn't take

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.900 
extremely small low profile doesn't take
up<00:02:13.060> too<00:02:13.210> much<00:02:13.390> room<00:02:14.160> great<00:02:15.160> for<00:02:15.430> a<00:02:15.460> workbench

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
up too much room great for a workbench

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.450 
up too much room great for a workbench
so<00:02:16.750> right<00:02:17.080> now<00:02:17.110> let's<00:02:17.440> go<00:02:17.590> ahead<00:02:17.800> go<00:02:18.190> to<00:02:18.310> each

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
so right now let's go ahead go to each

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.100
