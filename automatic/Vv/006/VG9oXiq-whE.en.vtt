00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
the game would have offered a completely

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.180 
the game would have offered a completely
different<00:01:53.179> experience<00:01:53.840> for<00:01:53.989> the<00:01:54.080> player<00:01:54.319> now

going to have fully 3d towns this was
very<00:02:50.780> different<00:02:51.109> from<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.439> final<00:02:51.769> product

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
very different from the final product

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.589 
very different from the final product
seeing<00:02:52.430> as<00:02:52.609> how<00:02:52.790> some<00:02:53.180> towns<00:02:53.419> were

character<00:02:56.090> models<00:02:56.419> in<00:02:56.510> them<00:02:56.629> in<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:57.470> beta<00:02:57.650> you

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:57.859 
character models in them in the beta you

00:02:57.859 --> 00:02:59.199 
character models in them in the beta you
can<00:02:57.980> also<00:02:58.129> see<00:02:58.430> that<00:02:58.459> there's<00:02:58.819> different

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
can also see that there's different

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.360 
can also see that there's different
environments<00:02:59.870> and<00:02:59.959> Link<00:03:00.319> can<00:03:00.500> jump<00:03:00.889> at<00:03:01.099> least

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
environments and Link can jump at least

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.429 
environments and Link can jump at least
from<00:03:01.760> what<00:03:01.849> I<00:03:01.879> can<00:03:02.090> see<00:03:02.329> he<00:03:02.510> can<00:03:02.750> and<00:03:02.989> that

00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:03.439 
from what I can see he can and that

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:05.379 
from what I can see he can and that
would<00:03:03.680> have<00:03:03.769> been<00:03:03.919> an<00:03:04.069> interesting<00:03:04.389> addition

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:05.389 
would have been an interesting addition

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:06.339 
would have been an interesting addition
to<00:03:05.510> say<00:03:05.689> the<00:03:05.840> least

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
to say the least

to say the least
another<00:03:07.010> interesting<00:03:07.280> thing<00:03:07.579> I<00:03:07.849> noticed<00:03:08.209> was

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
another interesting thing I noticed was

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:10.149 
another interesting thing I noticed was
that<00:03:08.510> in<00:03:08.659> one<00:03:09.019> set<00:03:09.230> of<00:03:09.319> gameplay<00:03:09.680> link<00:03:10.040> is

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:10.159 
that in one set of gameplay link is

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:12.369 
that in one set of gameplay link is
using<00:03:10.430> a<00:03:10.489> two-handed<00:03:11.030> sword<00:03:11.329> could<00:03:12.019> this<00:03:12.200> have

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:12.379 
using a two-handed sword could this have

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:14.170 
using a two-handed sword could this have
been<00:03:12.500> an<00:03:12.620> early<00:03:12.799> version<00:03:13.340> of<00:03:13.400> the<00:03:13.459> big<00:03:13.730> goron

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
been an early version of the big goron

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.479 
been an early version of the big goron
sword<00:03:14.480> it's<00:03:15.019> hard<00:03:15.469> to<00:03:15.620> say<00:03:15.829> but<00:03:15.889> that<00:03:16.340> would<00:03:16.459> be

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
sword it's hard to say but that would be

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.759 
sword it's hard to say but that would be
my<00:03:16.730> guess<00:03:17.030> I<00:03:17.299> also<00:03:17.780> think<00:03:18.079> the<00:03:18.169> game<00:03:18.349> looks<00:03:18.650> a

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
my guess I also think the game looks a

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.860 
my guess I also think the game looks a
bit<00:03:18.799> better<00:03:19.189> it<00:03:19.700> could<00:03:19.909> just<00:03:20.060> be<00:03:20.239> me<00:03:20.419> but<00:03:20.450> the

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
bit better it could just be me but the

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:21.940 
bit better it could just be me but the
characters<00:03:21.260> seem<00:03:21.409> to<00:03:21.439> move<00:03:21.680> more<00:03:21.919> naturally

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
characters seem to move more naturally

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.610 
characters seem to move more naturally
than<00:03:22.699> they<00:03:22.819> did<00:03:22.970> in<00:03:23.090> the<00:03:23.150> final<00:03:23.510> version<00:03:23.690> but

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
than they did in the final version but

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.530 
than they did in the final version but
with<00:03:24.769> all<00:03:25.010> that<00:03:25.040> aside<00:03:25.579> one<00:03:26.180> of<00:03:26.269> the<00:03:26.359> most

with all that aside one of the most

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.360 
with all that aside one of the most
fascinating<00:03:26.900> things<00:03:27.650> about<00:03:27.949> these<00:03:28.129> early

in<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:38.840> final<00:03:39.139> version<00:03:39.290> of<00:03:39.500> game<00:03:39.799> the

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
in the final version of game the

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.670 
in the final version of game the
Triforce<00:03:40.819> was<00:03:40.939> an<00:03:41.209> unobtainable<00:03:41.659> item<00:03:42.290> yes

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
Triforce was an unobtainable item yes

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.289 
Triforce was an unobtainable item yes
there<00:03:42.949> were<00:03:43.069> a<00:03:43.099> lot<00:03:43.310> of<00:03:43.340> rumors<00:03:43.699> regarding<00:03:43.849> it

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
there were a lot of rumors regarding it

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.119 
there were a lot of rumors regarding it
being<00:03:44.569> in<00:03:44.750> the<00:03:44.840> game<00:03:45.019> but<00:03:45.470> as<00:03:45.590> far<00:03:45.799> as<00:03:45.889> we<00:03:46.010> all

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:46.129 
being in the game but as far as we all

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:48.520 
being in the game but as far as we all
know<00:03:46.310> it's<00:03:46.699> not<00:03:47.090> in<00:03:47.299> there<00:03:47.540> and<00:03:47.750> it<00:03:48.109> makes<00:03:48.349> me

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
know it's not in there and it makes me

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.499 
know it's not in there and it makes me
wonder<00:03:48.709> what<00:03:49.189> role<00:03:49.519> the<00:03:49.699> Triforce<00:03:50.209> would<00:03:50.419> have

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:50.509 
wonder what role the Triforce would have

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:52.030 
wonder what role the Triforce would have
had<00:03:50.689> in<00:03:50.930> this<00:03:51.019> original<00:03:51.470> version<00:03:51.829> especially

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
had in this original version especially

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.800 
had in this original version especially
if<00:03:52.370> you<00:03:52.459> were<00:03:52.549> able<00:03:52.790> to<00:03:52.819> physically<00:03:53.329> get<00:03:53.629> the

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
if you were able to physically get the

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.469 
if you were able to physically get the
Triforce<00:03:54.609> unfortunately<00:03:55.609> we'll<00:03:56.060> never<00:03:56.090> know

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:56.479 
Triforce unfortunately we'll never know

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:58.539 
Triforce unfortunately we'll never know
and<00:03:56.750> there<00:03:57.500> you<00:03:57.620> have<00:03:57.650> it<00:03:57.859> a<00:03:58.129> far<00:03:58.519> more

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
and there you have it a far more

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.420 
and there you have it a far more

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:04.669 
originally done I'll be the first to

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:06.249 
originally done I'll be the first to
admit<00:04:04.759> that<00:04:04.970> I'm<00:04:05.239> really<00:04:05.540> sad<00:04:05.900> that<00:04:05.930> this

00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:06.259 
admit that I'm really sad that this

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:08.379 
admit that I'm really sad that this
didn't<00:04:06.620> come<00:04:06.739> out<00:04:06.889> the<00:04:07.489> original<00:04:07.970> version<00:04:08.299> of

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
it's crazy it would have been a

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.599
