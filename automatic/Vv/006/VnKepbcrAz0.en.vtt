00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 Did you have lunch? 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.500
 You have not ... 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:20.000
 Ok, here I have rice, chicken, and plantain as lunch. 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 Along with this soda with ice, and some dessert. Cool? 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 Besides that, I have ... 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 Dear friend, Juan, right? 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 And it is. 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.500
 How are you? 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.000
 Good. 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 Today is a day like every other one. 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 It is a day in which we all face decisions, problems, and difficult situations. 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 It is harder for some, than for others. And you know it. 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.000
 But Gd does not do that to harm us, but to make us stronger. 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 He does it to give us an opportunity to dream and wish for a better future. 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 You may be going through something difficult today, but I am sure that your heart is filled with goodness. 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 And if you had the opportunity to do something for someone, you would do it ... 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 He gives something special to each one of us. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 Trust in Gd and do not give up, because one day, to better future will come. 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 And you will thank Gd for having shown you the hard side. 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 That's how you get to appreciate the good and unforgettable moments. 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 This letter and this food is a gift for you to remember that there are people who do good. 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 People who spread the happiness and fill other people's hearts. 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 So, my friend, I give you a smile. 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.500
 Smile, man! Smile! 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.500
 But do me in favor. Make it last forever :) 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.500
 Boom! * fist bump *: P 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 I wish you all the best and may Gd bless you and fill you with health and happiness. 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 My name is Benjamin :) 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 Come on, man. Give me a hug. 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 Thanks a lot ... :) 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 Look, look. Here's the letter. 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 Where do you want to eat? Here? Okay. 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 Sit down. 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 Here's the food, and some dessert. 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 Here's the ice, I'll prepare the soda. 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 Enjoy, my brother :) 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 Alright, people. My friend, Juan, is enjoying his lunch. 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 We have done something great. 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 I hope you have a great future :) 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 Get the most out of every day. 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.500
 Thanks for everything, man ... Gd bless you :) 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 My brother, I can say the same. I wish you the best. 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 Look, look! Make it explode! 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 BOOOOOOMMM !!! : D * explosion sound effect * 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
