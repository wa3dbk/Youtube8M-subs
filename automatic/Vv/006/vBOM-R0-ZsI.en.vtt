wielding<00:02:19.420> is<00:02:19.510> our<00:02:19.660> new<00:02:19.810> mechanic<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:20.739> it

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
wielding is our new mechanic and it

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.190 
wielding is our new mechanic and it
sounds<00:02:22.150> a<00:02:22.209> lot<00:02:22.300> more<00:02:22.360> intimidating<00:02:22.959> than<00:02:22.989> it

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
sounds a lot more intimidating than it

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.690 
sounds a lot more intimidating than it
is<00:02:23.319> because<00:02:23.650> once<00:02:23.890> you<00:02:24.010> start<00:02:24.280> playing<00:02:24.430> with

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
is because once you start playing with

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.070 
is because once you start playing with
the<00:02:24.760> demon<00:02:25.209> arm<00:02:25.330> so<00:02:25.480> you<00:02:25.540> kind<00:02:25.750> of<00:02:25.810> figure<00:02:25.930> out

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
the demon arm so you kind of figure out

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.960 
the demon arm so you kind of figure out
how<00:02:26.230> they<00:02:26.410> work<00:02:26.590> yeah<00:02:26.920> they're<00:02:27.340> great<00:02:27.640> close

how they work yeah they're great close

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.550 
how they work yeah they're great close
range<00:02:28.300> they're<00:02:28.599> also<00:02:28.750> great<00:02:28.959> for<00:02:29.170> picking<00:02:29.440> up

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
range they're also great for picking up

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.110 
range they're also great for picking up
things<00:02:29.860> and<00:02:30.130> throwing<00:02:30.250> them<00:02:30.400> at<00:02:30.549> bar<00:02:30.970> the

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
things and throwing them at bar the

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.789 
things and throwing them at bar the
ranch<00:02:31.299> guns<00:02:31.630> are<00:02:31.810> good<00:02:31.930> for<00:02:32.080> very<00:02:32.319> far<00:02:32.590> range

them at one time yeah and the

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.430 
them at one time yeah and the
environment<00:02:37.420> is<00:02:37.569> kind<00:02:37.750> of<00:02:37.840> a<00:02:37.900> little<00:02:37.989> bit<00:02:38.110> more

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
environment is kind of a little bit more

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.470 
environment is kind of a little bit more
interactive<00:02:39.040> this<00:02:39.160> time<00:02:39.340> around<00:02:39.459> like<00:02:39.819> in<00:02:40.330> the

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
interactive this time around like in the

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.860 
interactive this time around like in the
demo<00:02:40.660> you<00:02:40.810> can<00:02:41.160> rip<00:02:42.160> a<00:02:42.190> door<00:02:42.819> off<00:02:43.209> of<00:02:43.239> a<00:02:43.569> police

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
demo you can rip a door off of a police

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.170 
demo you can rip a door off of a police
car<00:02:44.140> and<00:02:44.470> kind<00:02:45.069> of<00:02:45.160> like<00:02:45.310> hide<00:02:45.549> behind<00:02:45.760> it<00:02:46.060> and

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
car and kind of like hide behind it and

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.640 
car and kind of like hide behind it and

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
use it as a shield which I thought was

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.800 
use it as a shield which I thought was
really<00:02:47.799> cool<00:02:48.130> and<00:02:48.610> you<00:02:48.940> guys<00:02:49.090> have<00:02:49.299> also<00:02:49.630> done

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
really cool and you guys have also done

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.690 
really cool and you guys have also done
kind<00:02:50.140> of<00:02:50.200> a<00:02:50.290> huge<00:02:50.790> graphical<00:02:51.790> I<00:02:53.640> can't<00:02:54.640> even

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
kind of a huge graphical I can't even

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:55.740 
kind of a huge graphical I can't even
think<00:02:54.880> of<00:02:54.970> the<00:02:55.030> word<00:02:55.180> I'm<00:02:55.299> looking<00:02:55.330> for<00:02:55.660> but

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
think of the word I'm looking for but

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.150 
think of the word I'm looking for but
basically<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.440> game<00:02:56.560> looks<00:02:56.830> completely

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
basically the game looks completely

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.250 
basically the game looks completely
different<00:02:57.370> now<00:02:57.610> it<00:02:57.970> kind<00:02:58.360> of<00:02:58.420> got<00:02:58.569> this<00:02:58.780> almost

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
different now it kind of got this almost

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.490 
different now it kind of got this almost
cell<00:02:59.799> shading<00:03:00.280> to<00:03:00.459> it<00:03:00.580> but<00:03:00.760> not<00:03:00.910> quite<00:03:01.500> yeah

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
cell shading to it but not quite yeah

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.860 
cell shading to it but not quite yeah
it's<00:03:02.829> a<00:03:02.950> week<00:03:03.160> tried<00:03:03.489> going<00:03:04.359> down<00:03:04.570> a<00:03:04.630> cell

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
it's a week tried going down a cell

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.449 
it's a week tried going down a cell
shading<00:03:05.200> like<00:03:05.380> paths<00:03:05.650> but<00:03:05.680> then<00:03:06.160> it<00:03:06.280> wasn't

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
shading like paths but then it wasn't

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.539 
shading like paths but then it wasn't
quite<00:03:06.760> enough<00:03:07.410> what<00:03:08.410> we<00:03:08.500> call<00:03:08.950> it<00:03:09.070> graphic<00:03:09.430> new

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460

in the game I think that the thing that
I'm<00:04:51.640> most<00:04:51.669> excited<00:04:51.970> about<00:04:52.300> right<00:04:52.630> now

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
that the quad wielding mechanic is

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.960 
that the quad wielding mechanic is
really<00:04:57.350> a<00:04:57.590> lot<00:04:57.950> simpler<00:04:58.310> than<00:04:58.430> it<00:04:58.580> sounds

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
really a lot simpler than it sounds

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.640 
really a lot simpler than it sounds
people<00:04:59.870> are<00:04:59.960> coming<00:05:00.200> in<00:05:00.290> here<00:05:00.440> and<00:05:00.560> they're

was<00:05:04.940> actually<00:05:05.240> easier<00:05:05.570> for<00:05:05.600> me<00:05:05.810> to<00:05:05.900> pick<00:05:06.110> up

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
was actually easier for me to pick up

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.780 
was actually easier for me to pick up
during<00:05:06.500> the<00:05:06.620> demo<00:05:06.830> of<00:05:06.920> this<00:05:07.160> then<00:05:07.460> during<00:05:07.610> the

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790 
during the demo of this then during the

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.970 
during the demo of this then during the
actual<00:05:08.090> first<00:05:08.480> game<00:05:08.780> and<00:05:09.230> which<00:05:09.710> is<00:05:09.830> hilarious

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
actual first game and which is hilarious

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.380 
actual first game and which is hilarious
because<00:05:10.280> you<00:05:10.550> can<00:05:10.670> actually<00:05:10.760> do<00:05:10.970> more<00:05:11.180> with<00:05:11.360> it

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.390 
because you can actually do more with it

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.030 
because you can actually do more with it
but<00:05:11.720> i<00:05:12.020> think<00:05:12.290> the<00:05:12.350> controls<00:05:12.710> are<00:05:12.860> a<00:05:12.890> little

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
but i think the controls are a little

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.830 
but i think the controls are a little
bit<00:05:13.220> more<00:05:13.370> intuitive<00:05:13.880> this<00:05:14.060> time<00:05:14.270> around<00:05:14.420> yeah

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
bit more intuitive this time around yeah

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.210 
bit more intuitive this time around yeah
we've<00:05:15.020> been<00:05:15.140> focused<00:05:15.530> testing<00:05:15.830> them<00:05:15.950> before

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
we've been focused testing them before

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.490 
we've been focused testing them before
and<00:05:16.460> you<00:05:16.670> guys<00:05:16.790> have<00:05:17.090> you<00:05:17.390> know<00:05:17.540> areas<00:05:18.320> in<00:05:18.440> the
