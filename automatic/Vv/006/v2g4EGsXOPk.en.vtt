spaghetti I mean all things that you

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.340

could<00:03:36.980> get<00:03:37.160> outside<00:03:37.970> of<00:03:38.150> Disney<00:03:38.510> and<00:03:38.840> for<00:03:39.320> a

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
could get outside of Disney and for a

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.400 
could get outside of Disney and for a
lot<00:03:39.530> cheaper<00:03:39.560> for<00:03:40.250> that<00:03:40.370> matter<00:03:40.600> so<00:03:41.600> in<00:03:42.200> my
