00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
 now on a drive I have 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:14.009
 now a normal drive but that 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:17.670
 also to burn well, of course, at 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:20.400
 max pohl data bank expert extra is it 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.609
 so you get the complete one down here 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.609
 front 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:38.160
 at the normal job do that now one 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:43.789
 cool fast clip function so you 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:53.989
 simply pushes the drive up to approx 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:55.949
 yet so the front does not stop from 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:59.280
 always look where the distance is best 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:03.059
 you're right here to say so 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.189
 clips that take so out then you 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:13.799
 Now it's time to watch what it was like 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:17.580
 that still out a bit 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.960
 Maybe that's how it was now 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.479
 example even good 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.940
 if you had the front of these clips we are 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.460
 for example, in the second presses 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.990
 just back and so around and 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.990
 ready and the same you have to on the 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:44.470
 other pages on easy 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:52.409
 Print and ready now need the 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:52.409
 drive actually be firm actually 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:07.350
 nothing that is as a bit loose 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.940
 shit on it does not press the button 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.940
 do you use for the drive can 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.590
 maybe a little something later 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.860
 stabilize or so from who is now 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:26.379
 actually so the drive too 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:34.879
 already installed 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:35.840
 hard disk you've got used to 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:38.090
 hard disk slots 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.830
 yes we are a lot i have now 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.830
 the others have just done it 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:55.780
 what he shows here is just to do with 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:03:00.700
 lay the connections back so 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.700
 so easy to insert 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:17.450
 yes I think that needs in the simple 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:39.790
 press in purely then the surface must be so 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:39.790
 exactly what further back and ready 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:47.319
 now was only a short cut and then 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.319
 you go with the processor
