a number of options this applet provides
let's<00:00:12.990> choose<00:00:13.440> a<00:00:13.769> square<00:00:14.160> cross-section<00:00:14.700> from

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
let's choose a square cross-section from

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.410 
let's choose a square cross-section from
the<00:00:15.900> list<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:18.350> point<00:00:19.350> may<00:00:19.619> be<00:00:19.650> deselected<00:00:20.490> by

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
the list a point may be deselected by

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.429 
the list a point may be deselected by
clicking<00:00:21.960> that<00:00:22.109> point<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.680> second<00:00:23.220> time<00:00:23.460> and

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439 
clicking that point a second time and

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.310 
clicking that point a second time and
another<00:00:25.439> point<00:00:25.800> selected<00:00:26.720> the<00:00:27.720> create<00:00:28.080> button

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
another point selected the create button

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.160 
another point selected the create button
creates<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.550> queue<00:00:31.340> once<00:00:32.340> created<00:00:32.960> you<00:00:33.960> can

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
creates the queue once created you can

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.650 
creates the queue once created you can
rotate<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.860> queue<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.610> get<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.760> better<00:00:36.000> view<00:00:36.420> of

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
rotate the queue to get a better view of

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.160 
rotate the queue to get a better view of
what<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:37.590> have<00:00:37.739> made<00:00:38.600> does<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:39.750> look<00:00:39.930> like<00:00:39.960> a

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
what you have made does that look like a

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.200 
what you have made does that look like a
square<00:00:40.890> cross-section<00:00:43.640> yeah<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.670> did<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.059> me

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
square cross-section yeah I did to me

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.440 
square cross-section yeah I did to me
reasonable<00:00:46.190> another<00:00:47.190> type<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.640> cross<00:00:47.879> section

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
reasonable another type of cross section

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.770 
reasonable another type of cross section
may<00:00:49.200> be<00:00:49.230> selected<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.460> cube<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:50.910> reset<00:00:51.510> to

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
may be selected and the cube is reset to

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.459 
may be selected and the cube is reset to
its<00:00:52.020> initial<00:00:52.440> position<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:54.050> create<00:00:55.050> an

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
its initial position to create an

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.000 
its initial position to create an
isosceles<00:00:56.309> triangle<00:00:57.199> we<00:00:58.199> can<00:00:58.379> choose<00:00:58.649> these

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
isosceles triangle we can choose these

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:08.179 
isosceles triangle we can choose these
points<00:01:01.820> and<00:01:06.080> we've<00:01:07.080> selected<00:01:07.350> one<00:01:07.860> point

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
points and we've selected one point

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.380 
points and we've selected one point
incorrectly<00:01:08.850> it's<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.630> bit<00:01:10.700> it's<00:01:11.700> close<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.299> the

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
incorrectly it's a bit it's close to the

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.190 
incorrectly it's a bit it's close to the
next<00:01:12.600> point<00:01:12.869> Rhys<00:01:13.770> electing<00:01:14.310> creating<00:01:15.270> we

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
next point Rhys electing creating we

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.920 
next point Rhys electing creating we
have<00:01:16.320> got<00:01:17.040> an<00:01:17.189> isosceles<00:01:17.580> triangle<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.780> can

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
have got an isosceles triangle you can

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.200 
have got an isosceles triangle you can
count<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.380> distance<00:01:19.770> down<00:01:20.009> each<00:01:20.759> one<00:01:20.820> of

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
count the distance down each one of

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.080 
count the distance down each one of
these<00:01:21.330> edges<00:01:22.280> so<00:01:23.280> does<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.610> look<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.880> bit

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
these edges so does that look a bit

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.560 
these edges so does that look a bit
better<00:01:24.119> for<00:01:24.740> isosceles<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:26.310> think<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.390> looks

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
better for isosceles I think it looks

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.530 
better for isosceles I think it looks
very<00:01:27.720> good<00:01:27.869> ok<00:01:28.860> great<00:01:29.520> question<00:01:32.270> for<00:01:33.270> thought

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
very good ok great question for thought

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.700 
very good ok great question for thought
how<00:01:34.530> many<00:01:34.590> non<00:01:35.310> congruent<00:01:36.710> equilateral

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
how many non congruent equilateral

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.789 
how many non congruent equilateral
triangles<00:01:38.340> in<00:01:38.640> cross-section<00:01:39.630> are<00:01:40.229> possible

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
triangles in cross-section are possible

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.940 
triangles in cross-section are possible
