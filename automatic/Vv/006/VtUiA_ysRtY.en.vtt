00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.610 
and so I felt like that entire section
at<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.690> beginning<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:37.020> this<00:00:37.110> chapter<00:00:37.170> was

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
at the beginning of this chapter was

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.010

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
just there to waste time honestly it was

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.520 
just there to waste time honestly it was
because<00:00:40.590> if<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.370> look<00:00:41.520> at<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.820> actual<00:00:42.530> pacing

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
because if you look at the actual pacing

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.619
