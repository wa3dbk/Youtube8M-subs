as the island foxes so I found an

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:17.539 
environment very much their liking which

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:20.440 
environment very much their liking which
was<00:05:17.750> not<00:05:18.430> what<00:05:19.430> the<00:05:19.550> native<00:05:19.850> environment<00:05:20.330> was

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.450 
was not what the native environment was

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:21.909 
was not what the native environment was
several<00:05:20.870> hundred<00:05:21.140> years<00:05:21.260> ago<00:05:21.560> and<00:05:21.770> that

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 
several hundred years ago and that

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:23.560 
several hundred years ago and that
explains<00:05:22.310> why<00:05:22.520> they<00:05:22.760> were<00:05:22.789> able<00:05:23.210> to<00:05:23.240> make<00:05:23.539> a

explains why they were able to make a

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.330

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
living out there and of course the

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.990 
living out there and of course the
island<00:05:25.580> Fox<00:05:25.820> evolved<00:05:26.720> without<00:05:27.850> one<00:05:28.850> of<00:05:28.880> these

diurnal or daytime aerial predators in
the<00:05:31.970> sky<00:05:32.210> they<00:05:32.840> were<00:05:32.930> very<00:05:33.530> vulnerable<00:05:33.830> to

the sky they were very vulnerable to

predation<00:05:34.669> by<00:05:35.150> Golden<00:05:36.020> Eagles<00:05:36.350> and<00:05:36.530> that's

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 
predation by Golden Eagles and that's

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:39.940 
predation by Golden Eagles and that's
explains<00:05:37.700> why<00:05:37.970> the<00:05:38.030> population<00:05:38.870> declined<00:05:39.440> so

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:39.950 
explains why the population declined so

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.159 
explains why the population declined so
quickly<00:05:40.490> once<00:05:41.000> Golden<00:05:41.479> Eagles<00:05:41.750> started
