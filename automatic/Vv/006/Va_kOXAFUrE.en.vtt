00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.260
 but 

00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.590
 last week apple introduced the 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:09.110
 iphone 5s and one of the novelties is the 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:11.840
 fingerprint sensor built-in 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.570
 the home button called by apple 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.720
 touch haiti is a biometric sensor of 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:20.840
 170 microns thick with resolution of 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.420
 500 pixels per inch and able to read 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.430
 our fingerprint that allows 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.160
 users unlock their cell phones 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.560
 with just one finger press without 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.710
 remember complex letter sequences 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.710
 or numbers 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.330
 this shipment that we tell you that the 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.070
 biometrics is a technology of 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.170
 identification that is based on the 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.930
 recognition of a characteristic 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.239
 unique physics of people like the 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.430
 fingerprint the iris or the 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.559
 facial recognition that is applied in 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.440
 many processes for your safety and 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.420
 comfort as access controls for 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.460
 software applications to systems 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.530
 operative or any other application 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.239
 identification by 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.830
 incorporation of a biometric reader 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.830
 for integration 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.460
 clear examples of this technology the 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.970
 we saw in the cinema as in demolition man 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.610
 of 1993 with a device that 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.710
 identifies the voice of the police in the 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.810
 first installment of charly angels 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.030
 the spectacular sequence in which 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.300
 they break an intricate system of 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.790
 security and in a report 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.250
 prior to a society in which the 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:36.130
 iris recognition is a practice 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.680
 daily considered until a while ago 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.540
 like something science fiction the 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.130
 biometrics has become a 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.130
 commonly used word 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.220
 returning to the iphone that brings us 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.960
 have this reader to be a reader 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.240
 capacitive differs from the readers 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.909
 of optical fingerprints because he does not care 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.299
 the dirt that your finger has nor spots 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:04.180
 or anything on the other hand is also more 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:07.119
 sure how it only works with your finger 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.800
 it is possible to deceive you with a photo only 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.989
 could be done with materials from 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.739
 Conductivity similar to that of a finger 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:16.720
 human and with the same footprint as for 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.360
 the applications will help us 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.140
 unlock the terminal and identify us 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.140
 in the shop 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.140
 despite the fact that biometric technology 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.270
 offers a more convenient way of 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.000
 secure our apple devices 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.130
 could present failures such as 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.440
 possibility that the technology does not 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.319
 recognize the owner and can 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.690
 block and cryptographers say no 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:45.239
 they are especially safe for possible 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.849
 fakes and on the side of 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.890
 smartphones some attempts to include 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.260
 the fingerprint recognition have 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.099
 been a failure like in the motorola 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.099
 atrix 4g 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.120
 the negatives so it's worth asking 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.280
 what could come next is talking about the 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.410
 multimodal biometrics that uses 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.570
 different techniques together as a 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.140
 iris reader speech recognition 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:14.700
 and fingerprint technology 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.560
 some google android devices 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.660
 they are loaded with a system of 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.000
 facial recognition although they are 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.820
 can cheat by pointing to a picture of 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.890
 owner and company for jane lynch 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.500
 uses a bracelet to measure the 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.360
 beats of a person that are unique in 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.400
 each individual 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.320
 for now the evolution of technology 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.320
 biometric followed a gradual process 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.910
 the touch of this latest development of 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.820
 apple could mean death 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.680
 gradual use of the password and the 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.660
 opening of new and safer 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.210
 possibilities in terms of 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:56.450
 identification a sample of everything 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:56.450
 that security is coming first
