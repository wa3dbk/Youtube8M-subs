create tighter ringlets and we don't

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.380 
create tighter ringlets and we don't
want<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.540> we<00:01:54.750> don't<00:01:54.930> want<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.110> look<00:01:55.290> like

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390

Shirley<00:01:57.390> Temple<00:01:57.570> so<00:01:58.530> if<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:58.770> take<00:01:58.979> thicker

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
Shirley Temple so if you take thicker

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.539 
Shirley Temple so if you take thicker
sections<00:01:59.820> it<00:02:00.780> actually<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:01.829> can<00:02:02.009> do<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.280> in

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
sections it actually you can do it in

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.740 
sections it actually you can do it in
two<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:04.579> take<00:02:05.579> thicker<00:02:05.880> sections

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
two to take thicker sections

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.669 
two to take thicker sections
it'll<00:02:07.439> they'll<00:02:08.340> be<00:02:08.459> looser<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.349> then<00:02:10.349> you

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
it'll they'll be looser and then you

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.050 
it'll they'll be looser and then you
don't<00:02:10.920> want<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.129> hold<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.489> on<00:02:11.580> for<00:02:11.879> too<00:02:12.030> long

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
don't want to hold it on for too long

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.910 
don't want to hold it on for too long
because<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.750> longer<00:02:12.780> you<00:02:13.170> hold<00:02:13.290> it<00:02:13.410> on

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
because the longer you hold it on

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.220 
because the longer you hold it on
the<00:02:14.190> tighter<00:02:14.460> the<00:02:14.580> curls<00:02:15.030> Ravine<00:02:15.600> so<00:02:16.050> what<00:02:16.200> I

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
back in like this and then recur lit see

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.640 
back in like this and then recur lit see
some<00:04:53.360> of<00:04:53.449> these<00:04:53.539> sections<00:04:54.080> look<00:04:54.379> a<00:04:54.469> little
