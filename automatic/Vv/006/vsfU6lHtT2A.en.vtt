Hi guys!

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.900
Today I will show you how to make Lee Sin's cake 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.560
For the cake we will need 200 ml of oil

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:28.680
4 eggs

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.180
200gr of sugar

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.480
200gr of flour with 2 tsps of baking powder

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.140
First we will mix the eggs, the sugar and the oil

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.180
We will add the flour and baking powder

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.880
At the end we will add a tsp of vanilla paste

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.040
In my case I have used Non-Stick Spray for the mould

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.740
but you can add some butter and sprinkle some flour

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.860
We will put in the oven at 180ÂºC for 25 to 30 minutes

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.780
We will remove the cake from the mould and we let it rest in the cooling rack

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.580
We will cut Lee Sin's silhouette, it we help us to cut our cake later

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.440
We will cut the cake in half to fill with the buttercream later

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.120
For the filling we will do Chocolate buttercream

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.660
We will beat 150gr of butter and 150gr of icing sugar

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.040
We will add 90gr of chocolate previously melted in the microwave

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.740
We will continue mixing for 4-5 minutes till soft and fluffy

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.420
With the help of a spatula we will filling the cake with chocolate buttercream

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.200
We will let it rest in the fridge for 30 minutes

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.440
We  cover the cake with flesh colour fondant

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.860
We will do a pair of strips of red fondant for Lee sin's "eyeband"

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.700
With brown fondant we will make the facial hair and his braid

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.720
Tada! We have finished our Lee sin's Cake

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.200
