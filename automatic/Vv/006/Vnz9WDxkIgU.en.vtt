selling and pretty much taped it right
here<00:00:25.050> you<00:00:25.170> can<00:00:25.260> see<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.470> blue<00:00:25.619> tape<00:00:25.890> all<00:00:26.310> the

here you can see the blue tape all the
way<00:00:26.490> down<00:00:26.670> so<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.090> seals<00:00:27.390> on<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.869> air<00:00:28.140> can<00:00:28.380> get

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
way down so the seals on the air can get

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.780 
way down so the seals on the air can get
out<00:00:28.680> from<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.580> sides<00:00:30.920> I'll<00:00:31.920> take<00:00:32.579> down

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
out from the sides I'll take down

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:40.040 
out from the sides I'll take down
extremely<00:00:33.149> now<00:00:35.510> where's<00:00:36.510> that<00:00:38.899> guys<00:00:39.899> are

extremely now where's that guys are
probably<00:00:40.140> recognize<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.770> this<00:00:41.210> from<00:00:42.230> ps3<00:00:43.230> by

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
probably recognize to this from ps3 by

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.930 
probably recognize to this from ps3 by
Nyko<00:00:45.649> about<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:47.190> greatest<00:00:47.489> but<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.700> helps<00:00:47.879> a

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
Nyko about the greatest but it helps a

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.360 
Nyko about the greatest but it helps a
little<00:00:48.120> bit<00:00:48.320> so<00:00:49.320> inside<00:00:49.559> echoes<00:00:49.829> your<00:00:50.010> system

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
little bit so inside echoes your system

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.830 
little bit so inside echoes your system
down<00:00:50.550> five<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.910> 10<00:00:51.059> degrees<00:00:51.180> yeah<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.690> does

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
down five to 10 degrees yeah it does

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.600 
down five to 10 degrees yeah it does
actually<00:00:52.399> you<00:00:53.399> know<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:54.449> works<00:00:55.579> for<00:00:56.579> a

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
actually you know that works for a

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.010 
actually you know that works for a
couple<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:56.850> days<00:00:57.000> I'm<00:00:57.210> going<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.449> mix<00:00:57.600> grinding

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
couple of days I'm going to mix grinding

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.029 
couple of days I'm going to mix grinding
noises<00:00:58.170> from<00:00:58.530> hell<00:01:00.469> but<00:01:01.469> now<00:01:01.590> it's<00:01:01.710> not<00:01:01.829> the

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
noises from hell but now it's not the

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.090 
noises from hell but now it's not the
point<00:01:02.449> this<00:01:03.449> cool<00:01:03.660> right<00:01:03.840> here<00:01:04.199> there's

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
point this cool right here there's

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.760 
point this cool right here there's
something<00:01:05.460> different<00:01:05.580> compared<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:07.020> know<00:01:07.140> to

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
something different compared you know to

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.410 
something different compared you know to
that<00:01:08.010> color<00:01:08.310> lot<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:08.939> people<00:01:09.119> are<00:01:09.210> probably

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
that color lot of people are probably

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.660 
that color lot of people are probably
like<00:01:09.750> well<00:01:10.740> there's<00:01:10.950> probably<00:01:11.189> no<00:01:11.310> difference

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
like well there's probably no difference

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.510 
like well there's probably no difference
is<00:01:11.790> cool<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.030> same<00:01:12.240> not<00:01:12.869> really<00:01:13.220> as<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.400> can

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
is cool the same not really as you can

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.749 
is cool the same not really as you can
see<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:15.060> fans<00:01:15.390> right<00:01:15.750> there<00:01:16.310> trip<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.520> see<00:01:17.640> it

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
see the fans right there trip and see it

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.870 
see the fans right there trip and see it
but<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.090> bigger<00:01:18.860> way<00:01:19.860> bigger<00:01:19.890> i'm<00:01:20.430> using<00:01:20.610> the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
but the bigger way bigger i'm using the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.270 
but the bigger way bigger i'm using the
two<00:01:21.030> main<00:01:21.240> panel<00:01:21.770> and<00:01:22.770> also<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.250> probably

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
two main panel and also you probably

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.859 
two main panel and also you probably
can't<00:01:23.670> see<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.939> but<00:01:24.090> there's<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.390> sensor<00:01:24.840> in

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
can't see it but there's a sensor in

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.570 
can't see it but there's a sensor in
there<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:25.560> on<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.710> ps3<00:01:25.920> gets<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.250> little<00:01:26.369> too

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
there so on the ps3 gets a little too

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.359 
there so on the ps3 gets a little too
hot<00:01:26.990> automatically<00:01:27.990> flips<00:01:28.380> on<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:29.189> just

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
hot automatically flips on and it just

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.160 
hot automatically flips on and it just
starts<00:01:29.610> going<00:01:29.670> going<00:01:30.150> going<00:01:30.299> going<00:01:30.540> uses<00:01:30.990> its

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
starts going going going going uses its

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.539 
starts going going going going uses its
own<00:01:31.369> okay<00:01:32.780> just<00:01:33.780> keeps<00:01:34.049> going<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.350> going<00:01:34.549> when

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
own okay just keeps going and going when

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.859 
own okay just keeps going and going when
you<00:01:35.610> turn<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.820> ps3<00:01:36.570> off<00:01:36.799> that<00:01:37.799> will<00:01:38.040> turn<00:01:38.220> off

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
you turn the ps3 off that will turn off

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.469 
you turn the ps3 off that will turn off
this<00:01:39.869> will<00:01:40.079> sleep<00:01:40.259> going<00:01:40.640> until<00:01:41.640> history<00:01:42.390> is

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
this will sleep going until history is

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.080 
this will sleep going until history is
fully<00:01:42.659> cooled<00:01:42.930> down<00:01:43.079> now<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:44.850> only<00:01:45.000> good

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
fully cooled down now the only good

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.109 
fully cooled down now the only good
thing<00:01:45.149> about<00:01:45.329> this<00:01:45.659> is<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:46.320> right<00:01:46.770> here<00:01:47.310> from

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
thing about this is that right here from

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.889 
thing about this is that right here from
a<00:01:48.149> nazi<00:01:48.600> right<00:01:49.560> here<00:01:50.100> little<00:01:50.520> dark<00:01:50.759> there's<00:01:51.720> an

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
a nazi right here little dark there's an

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.039 
a nazi right here little dark there's an
opening<00:01:52.649> right<00:01:52.829> here<00:01:53.479> yeah<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.720> lets<00:01:54.930> a

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
opening right here yeah that lets a

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.450 
opening right here yeah that lets a
little<00:01:55.290> bit<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:55.950> know<00:01:55.979> air<00:01:56.219> comes

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
little bit of it and you know air comes

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.850 
little bit of it and you know air comes
over<00:01:56.610> there<00:01:56.759> too<00:01:56.909> but<00:01:57.060> not<00:01:57.240> nearly<00:01:57.390> as<00:01:57.540> hot

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
over there too but not nearly as hot

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.770 
over there too but not nearly as hot
what<00:01:58.860> people<00:01:59.189> don't<00:01:59.280> tell<00:01:59.549> you<00:01:59.579> is<00:01:59.729> right<00:02:00.240> here

what people don't tell you is right here
for<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.740> inner<00:02:02.250> core's<00:02:02.670> is<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.030> most<00:02:03.210> hottest

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
for the inner core's is the most hottest

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.110 
for the inner core's is the most hottest
part<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.140> unit

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
part of the unit

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.780 
part of the unit
because<00:02:07.479> the<00:02:08.479> drive<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:09.440> dvd-rom<00:02:10.250> drive<00:02:10.580> is

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
because the drive the dvd-rom drive is

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.560 
because the drive the dvd-rom drive is
right<00:02:11.150> here<00:02:12.070> that's<00:02:13.070> good<00:02:13.340> this<00:02:13.910> cpu<00:02:14.420> and<00:02:14.540> GPU

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
right here that's good this cpu and GPU

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.790 
right here that's good this cpu and GPU
is<00:02:15.250> all<00:02:16.250> right<00:02:16.700> here<00:02:16.970> so<00:02:17.750> i<00:02:17.780> build<00:02:18.110> up<00:02:18.320> and<00:02:18.590> pull
