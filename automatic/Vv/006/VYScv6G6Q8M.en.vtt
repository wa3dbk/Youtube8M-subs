Johnny Cash song so more about that

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
anyhow let's let's get into the lesson

anyhow let's let's get into the lesson
this<00:00:35.790> lick<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.300> was<00:00:36.420> just<00:00:36.600> using<00:00:36.840> I'm

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
this lick that I was just using I'm

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.139 
this lick that I was just using I'm
gonna<00:00:37.739> teach<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.129> scale<00:00:38.520> that<00:00:38.760> I've<00:00:38.910> used

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
gonna teach you the scale that I've used

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.700 
gonna teach you the scale that I've used
to<00:00:39.270> move<00:00:39.450> up<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:40.020> picking<00:00:40.320> technique

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
to move up and the picking technique

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.459 
to move up and the picking technique
that<00:00:40.860> I'm<00:00:40.950> using<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:42.750> get<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.110> kind<00:00:43.320> of

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
that I'm using to to get that kind of

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.900 
that I'm using to to get that kind of
you<00:00:43.770> know<00:00:43.890> roll<00:00:44.160> you're<00:00:44.460> really<00:00:44.670> sort<00:00:44.850> of

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
you know roll you're really sort of

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.470 
you know roll you're really sort of
bouncing<00:00:46.760> bouncing<00:00:47.760> sort<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.000> sound<00:00:48.210> it's<00:00:48.420> a

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
bouncing bouncing sort of sound it's a

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.180 
bouncing bouncing sort of sound it's a
combination<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.590> correct<00:00:49.860> picking

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
combination of the correct picking

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.700 
combination of the correct picking
technique<00:00:50.660> pull-offs<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.960> we're<00:00:52.320> using<00:00:52.530> a

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
technique pull-offs and we're using a

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.430 
technique pull-offs and we're using a
minor<00:00:52.949> blues<00:00:53.219> scale<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:54.449> I'm<00:00:54.930> gonna<00:00:55.110> do<00:00:55.350> this

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
minor blues scale so I'm gonna do this

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.590 
minor blues scale so I'm gonna do this
on<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.739> third<00:00:55.949> string<00:00:56.280> or<00:00:56.460> g-string<00:00:57.000> yeah

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
on the third string or g-string yeah

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.400 
on the third string or g-string yeah
very<00:00:57.960> funny

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
very funny

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.310 
very funny
moving<00:00:58.829> along<00:00:59.210> so<00:01:00.210> think<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:00.960> as<00:01:01.109> this<00:01:01.260> is

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
moving along so think of it as this is

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.600 
moving along so think of it as this is
our<00:01:01.620> root<00:01:01.890> chord<00:01:02.899> G<00:01:03.899> of<00:01:04.860> course<00:01:05.100> if<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.400> wanted

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
our root chord G of course if you wanted

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.980 
our root chord G of course if you wanted
to<00:01:05.700> do<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:05.939> from<00:01:06.090> say<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.360> second<00:01:06.720> string

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
to do it from say the second string

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.080 
to do it from say the second string
you'd<00:01:07.170> be<00:01:07.350> then<00:01:07.590> doing<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:07.950> from<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.189> B<00:01:08.400> which

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
you'd be then doing it from a B which

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.899 
you'd be then doing it from a B which
your<00:01:09.299> root<00:01:09.479> chord<00:01:09.720> would<00:01:09.840> be<00:01:10.159> most<00:01:11.159> likely<00:01:11.580> in

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
your root chord would be most likely in

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.510 
your root chord would be most likely in
the<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.420> know<00:01:12.570> in<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.869> be<00:01:13.049> there<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.250> scale

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
the you know in a be there so the scale

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.399 
the you know in a be there so the scale
that<00:01:14.700> we're<00:01:14.850> using<00:01:15.060> is<00:01:15.390> called<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.900> G<00:01:16.049> minor

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
that we're using is called the G minor

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.490 
that we're using is called the G minor
blues<00:01:17.869> we're<00:01:18.869> picking<00:01:19.170> down<00:01:20.479> and<00:01:21.479> well<00:01:22.170> what

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
blues we're picking down and well what

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.780 
blues we're picking down and well what
I'll<00:01:22.590> do<00:01:22.680> I'll<00:01:22.740> do<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.920> scale<00:01:23.100> first<00:01:23.310> so<00:01:23.520> we<00:01:23.640> go

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
I'll do I'll do the scale first so we go

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.920 
I'll do I'll do the scale first so we go
open<00:01:25.280> string<00:01:26.280> fret<00:01:26.820> sorry<00:01:27.030> third<00:01:27.299> fret<00:01:27.570> on<00:01:27.780> the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
open string fret sorry third fret on the

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.539

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
and 12

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.490 
and 12
one<00:01:36.840> thing<00:01:36.960> that's<00:01:37.049> really<00:01:37.170> cool<00:01:37.320> about

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
one thing that's really cool about

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.170 
one thing that's really cool about
learning<00:01:37.950> scales<00:01:38.189> going<00:01:38.490> straight<00:01:38.850> up<00:01:39.000> is

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
learning scales going straight up is

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.149 
learning scales going straight up is
it's<00:01:39.390> Eakins<00:01:39.810> it's<00:01:40.079> what<00:01:40.350> we<00:01:40.439> call<00:01:40.590> linear

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
it's Eakins it's what we call linear

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.170 
it's Eakins it's what we call linear
linear

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
linear

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.859 
linear
tomato<00:01:42.930> tomato<00:01:43.320> tomato<00:01:44.250> whatever<00:01:44.869> never

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
tomato tomato tomato whatever never

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.590 
tomato tomato tomato whatever never
heard<00:01:46.020> anyone<00:01:46.170> say<00:01:46.439> tomato<00:01:46.710> but<00:01:47.040> anyway<00:01:47.600> so

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
heard anyone say tomato but anyway so

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.880 
heard anyone say tomato but anyway so
that's<00:01:48.780> kind<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.110> cool<00:01:49.259> because<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.560> can<00:01:49.710> see

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
that's kind of cool because you can see

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.020 
that's kind of cool because you can see
the<00:01:50.040> steps<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.369> you're<00:01:50.490> taking<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:51.000> that

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
the steps that you're taking and that

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.639 
the steps that you're taking and that
folks<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.810> what<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.229> minor<00:01:52.409> blue

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
folks is the what is the minor blue

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.359 
folks is the what is the minor blue
shape<00:01:52.920> we<00:01:53.430> can<00:01:53.460> also<00:01:53.700> do<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.180> across<00:01:54.509> all

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.560 

right<00:01:59.369> but<00:01:59.610> that's<00:01:59.700> something<00:02:00.060> for<00:02:00.090> later<00:02:00.299> on

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:38.720 

you<00:03:12.490> can<00:03:12.610> say<00:03:12.760> that<00:03:12.940> so<00:03:13.030> we're<00:03:13.180> going<00:03:13.270> down

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.130 

alright<00:03:39.730> and<00:03:39.880> of<00:03:39.970> course<00:03:40.180> you<00:03:40.420> can<00:03:40.600> vary<00:03:40.870> that

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
alright and of course you can vary that

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.680 
alright and of course you can vary that
pattern<00:03:41.530> and<00:03:42.190> all<00:03:42.700> sorts<00:03:42.970> of<00:03:43.030> things<00:03:43.090> getting

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690
