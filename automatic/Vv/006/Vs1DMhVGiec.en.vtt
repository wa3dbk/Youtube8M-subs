00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
device I can also

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.120 
device I can also
name<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.490> group<00:02:14.610> so<00:02:14.910> if<00:02:15.000> I<00:02:15.120> have<00:02:15.300> all<00:02:15.540> of<00:02:15.570> my

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
name the group so if I have all of my

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.320 
name the group so if I have all of my
applications<00:02:17.130> in<00:02:17.400> one<00:02:17.610> selected<00:02:18.090> file

perhaps<00:02:18.720> it's<00:02:18.900> all<00:02:18.990> my<00:02:19.110> office<00:02:19.470> applications

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
perhaps it's all my office applications

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.610 
perhaps it's all my office applications
that<00:02:20.190> I<00:02:20.220> up<00:02:20.370> here<00:02:20.610> I<00:02:20.790> can<00:02:21.240> name<00:02:21.990> that<00:02:22.200> group<00:02:22.440> and

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
that I up here I can name that group and

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.600 
that I up here I can name that group and
make<00:02:22.770> sure<00:02:22.800> they<00:02:23.070> were<00:02:23.130> all<00:02:23.280> in<00:02:23.490> the<00:02:23.520> same

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
make sure they were all in the same

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.300 
make sure they were all in the same
place<00:02:24.030> now<00:02:24.930> let's<00:02:25.380> talk<00:02:25.560> a<00:02:25.590> little<00:02:25.680> bit<00:02:26.070> about

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
place now let's talk a little bit about

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.610 
place now let's talk a little bit about
applications<00:02:26.970> as<00:02:27.120> app<00:02:27.480> feel<00:02:28.020> so<00:02:28.320> there's<00:02:28.500> lots

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
applications as app feel so there's lots

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.680 
applications as app feel so there's lots
of<00:02:28.860> Microsoft<00:02:29.820> applications<00:02:30.420> you<00:02:30.540> get

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
of Microsoft applications you get

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.780 
of Microsoft applications you get
inbuilt<00:02:31.260> so<00:02:31.500> you<00:02:31.560> get<00:02:31.680> all<00:02:31.830> of<00:02:31.860> your<00:02:32.100> office
