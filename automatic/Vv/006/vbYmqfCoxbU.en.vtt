00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:10.380
 here is let's once again go back to the 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.660
 this question well, who has not seen the first 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.299
 rollers 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.980
 well there is a bunch of all sorts of comments 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.830
 there were a lot of questions about you all a bunch 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.869
 collected means reduced to what how 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.010
 correctly download or well given 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:28.619
 a lot of all kinds of links well guys 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.309
 i mean supporter of old school 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.850
 bodybuilding then there is still 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.940
 the time when the words of such a body 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:44.090
 building didn't hear it just didn't have 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:49.160
 us then was bodybuilding athleticism 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:53.129
 Well, new schools 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.350
 there now well I will undress for a while so 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.190
 to be better seen but cold i'm not 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.190
 want 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:11.350
 mean new schools harness with a bridge that is 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:18.940
 I take the barbell I do not want to use 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:21.340
 a lot of weight then rise but 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:25.020
 me designed for normal sacrificing 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:28.320
 do this and shake 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.320
 like this 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:40.600
 but I am opposed to such methods why here 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:44.560
 previously acted at competitions harvest 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:49.030
 so here is an athlete shakes like this 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:51.940
 judge and looks and here too, tore off 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:56.650
 all the competitions took off why 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:59.920
 that's so sorry it was easier trying now 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.850
 don't pump your chest like that 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.950
 he is not for pumping such a way for 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.080
 testimony results that is show 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.200
 here I shake there 100 kilograms there 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.230
 two hundred three hundred there 500 no matter then 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.990
 there is this way would not give you strength not 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.120
 will give you the beauty of the chest will not give the volume it 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.250
 way to lift big without everything that is 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.700
 here other tasks they take compare 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.490
 such a method is better such a method already 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:31.380
 the way to press with the bridge is a way to lift 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:34.930
 great weight on reading classic bench press 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.690
 this here you take the barbell up from you 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:42.090
 lies on two fingers above the nipple 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.239
 something like that is like this width 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.140
 grip 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.140
 such 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:55.290
 that is here as hard to get 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:03:00.940
 heavy load on the shoulder joints and 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:03.340
 work starts 30 i.e. width 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.849
 grip that's exactly working should be a year 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:09.670
 that is , here is the entire width of both 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:15.120
 itâ€™s not enough here 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:15.120
 I have pants for a press there longer than a neck 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:28.510
 here inhale exhale inhale exhale 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:31.930
 here it will be a classic press 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:36.959
 which is exactly what will let you pump 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:40.590
 the chest is right that's why here I saw 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:47.680
 repeatedly here so hang a show so 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:50.620
 resembling slightly feminine well I don't know 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.930
 there may be a bunch of factors but here we are 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.269
 We consider plastic that's like this 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.250
 way without a bridge 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:02.360
 if you are interested in power 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:06.290
 the results are the beauty 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.290
 chest muscles without a bridge 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:18.810
 then pump up your chest with one 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.810
 exercise not c 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.690
 like 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:27.070
 study of the chest here pumping ore 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:28.480
 should include but this program 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.930
 special ones i either 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:34.480
 generally developed independently 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:37.720
 either they are developed for you by the coach 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.310
 who is interested in your results 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.990
 that's which if you find here not 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.270
 just otmazatsya here is a man 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.190
 who is really interested 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:49.380
 your results that you would develop 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:52.030
 you program well, that is not difficult here 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.790
 bench is a basic exercise like this 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:05:00.790
 way to before it gets involved 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:04.660
 the whole chest area is also the bench but jim 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.530
 with the bridge this here for the bottom 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.140
 pectoral muscles 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:11.620
 but we have on the channel there you can 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:13.900
 look there are special boards 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.980
 special traps those performed presses 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.980
 But with this technique 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.770
 but other muscles are working there Well I 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:29.620
 repeatedly seen 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:34.770
 the hall comes here one part is developed 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.770
 chest well, that is, here's chest 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:43.640
 such a little flawed as well 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:50.760
 Well, I do not write under the chest goes well, but 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:54.210
 not alive well how can go 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:59.490
 chest if life fails you here 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:06:02.310
 You know, this is also a mistake . 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:05.370
 Any machines for information breeding 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:08.340
 bench press machines 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:11.910
 at an angle cool machines but they are good 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:16.410
 just as a major revision yet 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:18.900
 should be that the dumbbell is not if there is 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:21.540
 crimping weights and dumbbells 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:25.740
 that is, these are the exercises that 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:27.900
 will give beauty a breast shape 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:31.370
 let you pump thats right a 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:35.310
 then machine tools and things like that 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:39.060
 even here are the same pushups from the floor in 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:44.120
 some people can give more 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:46.410
 than we say some machine for that is 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.560
 Rudy correct pumping pumping at 

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:50.460
 people should be included and dozhim and 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.530
 wiring presses at different angles 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:55.800
 wiring at different angles that is what 

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:56.610
 more you add this to the main 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.430
 basic 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:03.780
 exercise bench press the more will be 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:07.700
 the result is finally what I want 

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:11.100
 say new here too see this 

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:13.740
 that is, a developed boy is waiting for a serious 

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:19.640
 weight well here is such a crouching posture 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:19.640
 he pumped up here such that it is this 

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:25.040
 flaw this is such a mistake favorite 

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:27.080
 and not favorite exercises 

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.690
 that is, this man is working with the breast 

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:33.020
 but does not work say with the back with the same 

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:35.870
 the broadest muscles with the same horizontal bar there 

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:36.880
 the same dumbbell dilutions under different 

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:41.030
 corners 

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:44.540
 here is the sort to go 

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:47.150
 the result of the chest man is the same 

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:50.630
 pen spoil human posture only 

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:52.810
 because not all muscles are worked through 

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:52.810
 bodies
