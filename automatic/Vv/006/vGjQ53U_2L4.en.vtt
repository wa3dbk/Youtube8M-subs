00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
how you can avoid that so what we would

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.000 
how you can avoid that so what we would
do<00:00:56.540> is<00:00:56.660> you<00:00:56.780> would<00:00:56.870> declare<00:00:57.020> a<00:00:57.230> charge<00:00:57.559> and

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
do is you would declare a charge and

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.700 
do is you would declare a charge and
he's<00:00:58.610> gonna<00:00:58.850> clearly<00:00:59.780> can<00:01:00.079> make<00:01:00.230> that<00:01:00.440> even

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
he's gonna clearly can make that even

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.010 
he's gonna clearly can make that even
with<00:01:00.800> a<00:01:00.829> low<00:01:01.280> roll<00:01:01.550> and<00:01:02.149> he's<00:01:02.570> gonna<00:01:02.719> charge

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 
with a low roll and he's gonna charge

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.200 
with a low roll and he's gonna charge
now<00:01:03.739> most<00:01:03.980> people<00:01:04.129> will<00:01:04.579> move<00:01:04.759> their<00:01:04.909> model

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
now most people will move their model

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.899 
now most people will move their model
like<00:01:05.329> that<00:01:05.360> squaring<00:01:06.079> off<00:01:06.229> one<00:01:06.500> on<00:01:06.530> one

site<00:01:35.450> earth<00:01:35.659> so<00:01:36.560> we<00:01:36.679> can<00:01:36.829> see<00:01:37.069> that<00:01:37.310> he<00:01:37.490> is

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
site earth so we can see that he is

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.249 
site earth so we can see that he is
clearly<00:01:37.939> in<00:01:38.149> the<00:01:38.240> front<00:01:38.479> arc<00:01:38.719> of<00:01:38.959> our

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
clearly in the front arc of our

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.379 
clearly in the front arc of our
Manticore<00:01:39.740> and<00:01:40.520> what<00:01:40.670> that<00:01:40.819> means<00:01:40.969> is<00:01:41.240> that<00:01:41.270> he

00:01:41.379 --> 00:01:41.389 
Manticore and what that means is that he

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:43.539 
Manticore and what that means is that he
has<00:01:41.569> to<00:01:41.719> charge<00:01:41.899> and<00:01:42.139> make<00:01:42.229> contact<00:01:42.679> in<00:01:43.069> the

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
has to charge and make contact in the

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.690 
has to charge and make contact in the
front<00:01:43.789> arc<00:01:44.259> so<00:01:45.259> normally<00:01:45.889> he<00:01:46.310> would<00:01:46.459> charge

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
front arc so normally he would charge

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.739 
front arc so normally he would charge
and<00:01:46.880> connect<00:01:47.149> on<00:01:47.240> the<00:01:47.329> corner<00:01:47.659> because

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:47.749 
and connect on the corner because

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:49.269 
and connect on the corner because
they're<00:01:47.959> both<00:01:48.049> on<00:01:48.259> 50<00:01:48.529> millimeter<00:01:48.889> bases

00:01:49.269 --> 00:01:49.279 
they're both on 50 millimeter bases

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:51.969 
they're both on 50 millimeter bases
because<00:01:50.149> he<00:01:50.240> can't<00:01:50.450> do<00:01:50.630> that<00:01:50.810> he<00:01:51.469> can't<00:01:51.740> charge

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
because he can't do that he can't charge

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:53.649 
because he can't do that he can't charge
in<00:01:52.130> the<00:01:52.189> flank<00:01:52.429> because<00:01:52.909> he's<00:01:53.179> in<00:01:53.389> the<00:01:53.419> front

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
in the flank because he's in the front

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.389 
in the flank because he's in the front
arc<00:01:53.929> of<00:01:54.049> the<00:01:54.109> manticore<00:01:54.380> and<00:01:54.829> he<00:01:55.189> would<00:01:55.279> have

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
arc of the manticore and he would have

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.449 
arc of the manticore and he would have
to<00:01:55.490> go<00:01:55.609> around<00:01:56.200> any<00:01:57.200> unit<00:01:57.649> including<00:01:58.039> monsters

00:01:58.449 --> 00:01:58.459 
to go around any unit including monsters

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:59.889 
to go around any unit including monsters
when<00:01:58.729> they<00:01:58.849> charge<00:01:59.119> are<00:01:59.329> allowed<00:01:59.509> one

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
when they charge are allowed one

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.739 
when they charge are allowed one
90-degree<00:02:00.829> turn<00:02:01.069> to<00:02:01.249> do<00:02:01.369> that<00:02:01.549> he<00:02:02.299> can't<00:02:02.569> do

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:02.749 
90-degree turn to do that he can't do

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:04.389 
90-degree turn to do that he can't do
that<00:02:02.899> because<00:02:03.079> a<00:02:03.289> 90-degree<00:02:03.829> turn<00:02:03.859> will<00:02:04.189> turn

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
that because a 90-degree turn will turn

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:06.459 
that because a 90-degree turn will turn
him<00:02:04.520> this<00:02:04.669> way<00:02:04.849> up<00:02:05.479> and<00:02:05.719> he<00:02:05.810> failed<00:02:06.079> charges

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469 
him this way up and he failed charges

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:08.440 
him this way up and he failed charges
there<00:02:06.679> so<00:02:06.979> now<00:02:07.099> that<00:02:07.159> stegun<00:02:07.669> on<00:02:07.789> is<00:02:08.090> stuck

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
there so now that stegun on is stuck

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.600 
there so now that stegun on is stuck
here<00:02:08.720> watching<00:02:09.619> as<00:02:09.890> his<00:02:10.039> other<00:02:10.160> staggered<00:02:10.520> on

you're<00:02:31.099> not<00:02:31.129> reducing<00:02:31.819> the<00:02:32.329> number<00:02:32.659> of<00:02:32.689> models

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
you're not reducing the number of models

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.470 
you're not reducing the number of models
in<00:02:33.349> contact<00:02:33.739> for<00:02:33.950> a<00:02:33.980> combat<00:02:34.459> you<00:02:35.060> can<00:02:35.090> charge

as long as you touch the right way so

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.569 
as long as you touch the right way so
that<00:02:38.269> has<00:02:38.450> been<00:02:38.629> our<00:02:38.900> bowls<00:02:39.200> I<00:02:39.530> guess<00:02:40.250> it's<00:02:40.430> not

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:40.579 
that has been our bowls I guess it's not

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:42.399 
that has been our bowls I guess it's not
cheating<00:02:40.879> but<00:02:41.239> if<00:02:41.389> the<00:02:41.480> rules<00:02:41.689> academy<00:02:42.200> thing

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:42.409 
cheating but if the rules academy thing

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:44.470 
cheating but if the rules academy thing
today<00:02:42.590> look<00:02:43.370> forward<00:02:43.609> to<00:02:43.670> more<00:02:43.790> fantasy<00:02:44.269> stuff

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
today look forward to more fantasy stuff

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.940 
today look forward to more fantasy stuff
hopefully<00:02:44.900> we'll<00:02:45.019> see<00:02:45.139> caldera<00:02:45.560> next<00:02:45.799> week

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
hopefully we'll see caldera next week

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.530 
hopefully we'll see caldera next week
with<00:02:46.129> what<00:02:46.280> he<00:02:46.340> thinks<00:02:46.549> up<00:02:46.670> 440

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540
