00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:04.789 

so<00:00:03.179> as<00:00:03.480> you<00:00:03.600> can<00:00:03.720> see<00:00:03.780> I<00:00:03.990> just<00:00:04.140> got<00:00:04.500> finished

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
so as you can see I just got finished

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:11.990 
so as you can see I just got finished
with<00:00:05.040> the<00:00:05.990> extract<00:00:06.990> an<00:00:07.140> injector<00:00:07.649> and<00:00:08.719> so<00:00:11.000> the

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
with the extract an injector and so the

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.120 
with the extract an injector and so the
ejector<00:00:12.630> on<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.870> AKM<00:00:13.349> is<00:00:13.559> actually<00:00:13.920> very

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
ejector on the AKM is actually very

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.670 
ejector on the AKM is actually very
simple<00:00:14.670> it's<00:00:14.969> just<00:00:15.150> part<00:00:15.719> of<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.900> rail<00:00:16.109> that's

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
simple it's just part of the rail that's

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.480 
simple it's just part of the rail that's
on<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.920> inside<00:00:17.039> of<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.580> receiver<00:00:19.369> so<00:00:20.369> the

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
on the inside of the receiver so the

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.820 
on the inside of the receiver so the
ejector<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:20.970> this<00:00:21.150> piece<00:00:21.900> right<00:00:22.109> there<00:00:22.170> that's

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
ejector is this piece right there that's

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.620 
ejector is this piece right there that's
sticking<00:00:23.130> out<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.640> that<00:00:24.050> part<00:00:25.050> moves<00:00:25.619> into<00:00:25.949> a

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
sticking out and that part moves into a

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.589 
sticking out and that part moves into a
cutout<00:00:27.630> in<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.470> bolt<00:00:29.150> which<00:00:30.150> runs<00:00:30.390> all<00:00:30.570> the

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
cutout in the bolt which runs all the

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.380 
cutout in the bolt which runs all the
way<00:00:30.689> through<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:31.140> bull<00:00:31.590> phase<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.460> so<00:00:33.300> of

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
way through the bull phase and so of

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.690 
way through the bull phase and so of
course<00:00:33.570> when<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.190> cartridge<00:00:35.190> is<00:00:35.219> on<00:00:35.489> there

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
course when the cartridge is on there

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.819 
course when the cartridge is on there
and<00:00:36.680> both<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.920> pushed<00:00:38.850> back<00:00:39.170> that<00:00:40.170> part<00:00:40.410> kicks

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
and both is pushed back that part kicks

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.750 
and both is pushed back that part kicks
the<00:00:41.040> empty<00:00:41.790> case<00:00:41.940> out<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:43.489> yeah<00:00:44.489> that's<00:00:44.700> how

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
the empty case out so yeah that's how

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.979 
the empty case out so yeah that's how
the<00:00:44.850> ejector<00:00:45.360> works<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:46.850> the<00:00:47.850> extractor<00:00:48.390> is

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
the ejector works and the extractor is

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.799 
the ejector works and the extractor is
essentially<00:00:50.120> just<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.870> simple<00:00:52.199> hook<00:00:52.379> just<00:00:53.340> like

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
essentially just a simple hook just like

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.860 
essentially just a simple hook just like
pretty<00:00:54.809> much<00:00:54.840> any<00:00:55.110> other<00:00:55.230> extractor<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.870> I

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
pretty much any other extractor and I

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.920 
pretty much any other extractor and I
can<00:00:58.079> take<00:00:59.039> this<00:00:59.160> out<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.550> show<00:00:59.820> you<00:01:00.390> guys<00:01:00.719> what

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
can take this out to show you guys what

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.080 
can take this out to show you guys what
it<00:01:00.989> looks<00:01:01.170> like

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
it looks like

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.160 
it looks like
so<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.739> ak-47<00:01:05.090> extractor<00:01:06.090> maker<00:01:06.510> forged<00:01:06.930> a

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
so the ak-47 extractor maker forged a

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.820 
so the ak-47 extractor maker forged a
case<00:01:07.380> file<00:01:07.710> extract<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.369> guess<00:01:09.619> it's<00:01:10.619> pretty

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
case file extract I guess it's pretty

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.820 
case file extract I guess it's pretty
much<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.250> cylinder<00:01:12.860> cylinder<00:01:13.860> like<00:01:14.310> shape<00:01:15.830> with

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
much a cylinder cylinder like shape with

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.370 
much a cylinder cylinder like shape with
the<00:01:17.070> cut<00:01:17.700> right<00:01:17.909> there<00:01:17.939> where<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.659> hooks<00:01:19.110> onto

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
the cut right there where it hooks onto

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.460 
the cut right there where it hooks onto
the<00:01:19.500> rim<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.220> cartridge<00:01:21.200> another<00:01:22.200> cut

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
the rim of the cartridge another cut

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.660 
the rim of the cartridge another cut
right<00:01:22.680> there<00:01:22.710> where<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.549> retaining<00:01:24.060> pin<00:01:24.180> is

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
right there where the retaining pin is

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.760 
right there where the retaining pin is
will<00:01:26.670> fit<00:01:26.880> into<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.390> that's<00:01:28.200> also<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.619> point

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
will fit into and that's also the point

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.920 
will fit into and that's also the point
where<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.159> will<00:01:29.540> if<00:01:30.540> it's<00:01:30.750> around<00:01:31.680> around<00:01:32.340> and

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
where it will if it's around around and

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.510 
where it will if it's around around and
there's<00:01:33.930> also<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.229> little<00:01:34.380> spring<00:01:34.740> in<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.340> back

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
there's also a little spring in the back

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.660 
there's also a little spring in the back
which<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.420> still<00:01:36.630> in<00:01:36.810> there<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.520> the<00:01:38.520> ball

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
which is still in there and the ball

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.700 
which is still in there and the ball
also<00:01:39.450> force<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.900> against<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.320> rim<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.560> the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
also force it against the rim of the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.660 
also force it against the rim of the
cartridge<00:01:41.689> so<00:01:42.689> it's<00:01:42.840> fairly<00:01:43.670> straight

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
cartridge so it's fairly straight

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.480 
cartridge so it's fairly straight
forward<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:45.060> guess<00:01:45.110> and<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.649> way<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:46.920> made<00:01:47.310> this

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
forward I guess and the way I made this

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.340 
forward I guess and the way I made this
is<00:01:48.649> the<00:01:49.649> comb<00:01:49.829> use<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.840> some<00:01:51.840> kind<00:01:52.049> of<00:01:52.140> metal

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
is the comb use the some kind of metal

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.130 
is the comb use the some kind of metal
rod<00:01:52.880> which<00:01:53.880> he<00:01:54.030> cut<00:01:54.240> into<00:01:54.390> shape<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:54.960> I

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
rod which he cut into shape and I

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.639 
rod which he cut into shape and I
couldn't<00:01:56.070> find<00:01:56.250> anything<00:01:56.490> like<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:56.820> so<00:01:57.210> I

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
couldn't find anything like that so I

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.030 
couldn't find anything like that so I
just<00:01:58.649> made<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:58.979> out<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.219> pure<00:01:59.820> fullbring<00:02:00.360> wire

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
just made it out of pure fullbring wire

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.109 
just made it out of pure fullbring wire
which<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.189> then<00:02:03.170> cut<00:02:04.170> into<00:02:04.290> shape<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:05.119> polished

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
which I then cut into shape and polished

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.520 
which I then cut into shape and polished
and<00:02:06.329> all<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:07.190> so<00:02:08.190> yeah<00:02:08.789> that's<00:02:09.000> pretty<00:02:09.530> much

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
and all that so yeah that's pretty much

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.199 
and all that so yeah that's pretty much
it<00:02:10.619> on<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.039> extractor<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:11.640> I<00:02:11.760> think<00:02:12.090> I'm

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
it on the extractor and I think I'm

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.140 
it on the extractor and I think I'm
gonna

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
gonna

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.130 
gonna
start<00:02:13.959> making<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.319> magazine<00:02:14.739> right<00:02:14.920> now<00:02:14.980> and

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
start making the magazine right now and

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.300 
start making the magazine right now and
see<00:02:17.140> if<00:02:17.230> I<00:02:17.349> can<00:02:18.360> complete<00:02:19.360> the<00:02:19.569> whole<00:02:19.720> cycle<00:02:20.110> of

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
see if I can complete the whole cycle of

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.290 
see if I can complete the whole cycle of
unlocking<00:02:21.310> and<00:02:22.230> ejecting<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:23.349> all<00:02:23.440> that<00:02:23.590> so

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
unlocking and ejecting and all that so

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.050 
unlocking and ejecting and all that so
yeah<00:02:25.300> see<00:02:25.540> you<00:02:25.599> guys<00:02:25.720> next<00:02:25.930> time
