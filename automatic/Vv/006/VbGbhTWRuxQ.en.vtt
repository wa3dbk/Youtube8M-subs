00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.330 
even him this is a clone of him I really
need<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.170> catch<00:01:37.380> up<00:01:37.560> on<00:01:37.619> my<00:01:37.680> comics<00:01:38.159> because

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
need to catch up on my comics because

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.649 
need to catch up on my comics because
this<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.640> getting<00:01:38.790> really<00:01:39.030> complicated

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
this is getting really complicated

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.660 
this is getting really complicated
evidently<00:01:40.259> this<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.530> clone<00:01:40.890> that<00:01:40.920> went<00:01:41.549> by

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
evidently this is a clone that went by

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.490 
evidently this is a clone that went by
ant-man<00:01:41.970> for<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.329> while<00:01:42.509> then<00:01:42.780> went<00:01:42.960> by<00:01:43.079> Black

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
ant-man for a while then went by Black

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.050 
ant-man for a while then went by Black
Ant<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:43.920> guess<00:01:44.250> from<00:01:44.490> what<00:01:44.579> I've<00:01:44.790> read<00:01:44.939> about

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
Ant I guess from what I've read about

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.950 
Ant I guess from what I've read about
him<00:01:45.180> I'm<00:01:45.450> not<00:01:45.960> 100%<00:01:46.350> sure<00:01:46.729> but<00:01:47.729> what<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.030> have

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
him I'm not 100% sure but what I have

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.950 
him I'm not 100% sure but what I have
gleaned<00:01:49.770> from<00:01:50.009> my<00:01:50.640> internet<00:01:51.299> browsing<00:01:51.600> is

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
gleaned from my internet browsing is

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.230 
gleaned from my internet browsing is
that<00:01:52.409> this<00:01:52.619> figure<00:01:52.799> is<00:01:53.070> just<00:01:53.100> dead<00:01:53.610> on<00:01:53.640> comic

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240

but<00:03:30.030> on<00:03:30.269> him<00:03:30.569> I<00:03:30.750> actually<00:03:31.079> kind<00:03:31.530> of<00:03:31.560> really

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
but on him I actually kind of really

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.289 
but on him I actually kind of really
liked<00:03:31.950> it<00:03:32.160> I<00:03:32.280> don't<00:03:32.430> miss<00:03:32.579> the<00:03:32.700> calf<00:03:32.880> swivels

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
liked it I don't miss the calf swivels

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.599 
liked it I don't miss the calf swivels
and<00:03:33.419> I<00:03:33.450> think<00:03:33.660> he's<00:03:33.870> just<00:03:34.079> a<00:03:34.200> lot<00:03:34.380> of<00:03:34.440> fun<00:03:34.739> to<00:03:35.040> to

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
and I think he's just a lot of fun to to

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:38.629 
and I think he's just a lot of fun to to
play<00:03:35.790> around<00:03:36.030> with<00:03:36.180> and<00:03:36.950> the<00:03:37.950> costume<00:03:38.459> might

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
play around with and the costume might

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.449 
play around with and the costume might
be<00:03:38.760> influencing<00:03:39.359> my<00:03:39.950> opinion<00:03:40.950> but<00:03:41.099> I'm<00:03:41.310> not

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
be influencing my opinion but I'm not

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.390 
be influencing my opinion but I'm not
sure<00:03:41.810> so<00:03:42.810> he's<00:03:43.109> black<00:03:43.440> and<00:03:43.470> red<00:03:43.919> pretty<00:03:44.250> much

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
sure so he's black and red pretty much

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.240 
sure so he's black and red pretty much
head<00:03:44.609> to<00:03:44.760> toe<00:03:45.000> with<00:03:45.840> some<00:03:46.079> orange<00:03:46.349> details<00:03:47.010> on

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
head to toe with some orange details on

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.729 
head to toe with some orange details on
his<00:03:47.459> helmet<00:03:48.299> here<00:03:48.630> kind<00:03:49.019> of<00:03:49.049> looked<00:03:49.230> like<00:03:49.290> it's

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
his helmet here kind of looked like it's

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.860 
his helmet here kind of looked like it's
glowing<00:03:50.190> I<00:03:50.519> think<00:03:51.269> that's<00:03:51.419> a<00:03:51.480> pretty<00:03:51.599> cool

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
glowing I think that's a pretty cool

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:52.970 
glowing I think that's a pretty cool
effect<00:03:52.019> it<00:03:52.349> looks<00:03:52.470> like<00:03:52.560> his<00:03:52.680> eyes<00:03:52.739> are

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
effect it looks like his eyes are

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.589 
effect it looks like his eyes are
glowing<00:03:53.130> you<00:03:53.340> can<00:03:53.459> see<00:03:53.669> some<00:03:53.849> pupils<00:03:54.150> in<00:03:54.450> there

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
glowing you can see some pupils in there

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.979 
glowing you can see some pupils in there
that<00:03:54.780> are<00:03:54.900> like<00:03:55.109> kind<00:03:55.260> of<00:03:55.380> like<00:03:55.470> a<00:03:55.500> peach<00:03:55.799> color

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
that are like kind of like a peach color

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.229 
that are like kind of like a peach color
but<00:03:57.989> I<00:03:58.230> think<00:03:58.650> he<00:03:58.889> is<00:03:59.010> kind<00:03:59.370> of<00:03:59.430> a<00:03:59.519> really<00:03:59.910> good

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
but I think he is kind of a really good

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.599 
but I think he is kind of a really good
looking<00:04:00.690> figure<00:04:01.470> right<00:04:01.739> from<00:04:01.980> from<00:04:02.280> head<00:04:02.459> to

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
looking figure right from from head to

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:04.789 
looking figure right from from head to
toe<00:04:02.790> I<00:04:03.030> mean<00:04:03.599> paint<00:04:03.930> apps<00:04:04.109> are<00:04:04.260> kind<00:04:04.440> of<00:04:04.530> sparse

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
toe I mean paint apps are kind of sparse

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.680 
toe I mean paint apps are kind of sparse
here<00:04:05.040> it's<00:04:05.190> basically<00:04:05.579> just<00:04:05.669> a<00:04:06.060> black<00:04:06.389> body

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
here it's basically just a black body

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.379 
here it's basically just a black body
with<00:04:07.019> some<00:04:07.169> red<00:04:07.349> paint<00:04:07.560> added<00:04:08.090> so<00:04:09.090> I<00:04:09.120> mean

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389 
with some red paint added so I mean

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:11.539 
with some red paint added so I mean
there's<00:04:09.569> not<00:04:09.690> much<00:04:10.079> to<00:04:10.410> the<00:04:10.560> design<00:04:10.859> if<00:04:11.250> we<00:04:11.400> go

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
there's not much to the design if we go

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:12.650 
there's not much to the design if we go
all<00:04:11.699> the<00:04:11.729> way<00:04:11.820> around<00:04:12.000> again

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
all the way around again

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.930 
all the way around again
yeah<00:04:12.930> that's<00:04:13.109> what<00:04:13.229> we<00:04:13.320> get<00:04:13.699> there's<00:04:14.699> also<00:04:14.820> a

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
yeah that's what we get there's also a

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.220 
yeah that's what we get there's also a
new<00:04:15.090> belt<00:04:15.449> here

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
new belt here

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.540 
new belt here
also<00:04:16.560> knew<00:04:16.710> I<00:04:16.740> forgot<00:04:16.890> to<00:04:17.160> point<00:04:17.310> that<00:04:17.490> out

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:17.550 
also knew I forgot to point that out

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:21.590 
also knew I forgot to point that out
before<00:04:17.910> on<00:04:18.120> the<00:04:18.240> comparison<00:04:19.280> but<00:04:20.330> that's<00:04:21.330> kind

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
before on the comparison but that's kind

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.770 
before on the comparison but that's kind
of<00:04:21.630> what<00:04:21.750> we're<00:04:21.930> looking<00:04:22.110> at<00:04:23.240> so<00:04:24.240> in<00:04:24.420> terms<00:04:24.630> of

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
of what we're looking at so in terms of

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.630 
of what we're looking at so in terms of
articulation<00:04:25.530> and<00:04:25.680> all<00:04:25.830> that<00:04:26.010> stuff<00:04:26.370> it's

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
articulation and all that stuff it's

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.420 
articulation and all that stuff it's
it's<00:04:26.910> pretty<00:04:27.180> standard<00:04:27.450> you<00:04:27.870> know<00:04:28.010> the<00:04:29.010> arms

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430

it's pretty standard you know the arms
have<00:04:29.850> a<00:04:29.880> full<00:04:30.210> range<00:04:30.570> the<00:04:30.870> shoulders<00:04:31.170> go<00:04:31.320> all

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
the way around they can move out from

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.510 
the way around they can move out from
the<00:04:33.720> body<00:04:33.900> he's<00:04:34.200> got<00:04:34.700> double<00:04:35.700> elbows<00:04:36.090> and<00:04:36.600> a

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
really good range of motion they're

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.710 
really good range of motion they're
almost<00:04:44.550> too<00:04:44.850> good<00:04:45.060> I<00:04:45.090> mean<00:04:45.240> you<00:04:45.360> can<00:04:45.450> do<00:04:45.570> some

range<00:04:57.030> of<00:04:57.150> motion<00:04:57.480> there<00:04:58.040> there's<00:04:59.040> a<00:04:59.130> swivel

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
range of motion there there's a swivel

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.370 
range of motion there there's a swivel
that<00:05:00.180> can<00:05:00.420> go<00:05:00.540> all<00:05:00.570> the<00:05:00.810> way<00:05:01.260> around<00:05:01.500> and<00:05:03.380> he

some<00:06:25.740> issues<00:06:26.130> with<00:06:26.240> agent<00:06:27.240> venom

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:29.580 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.570 

who<00:06:30.420> ironically<00:06:31.140> was<00:06:31.440> also<00:06:31.800> a<00:06:32.130> Walgreens

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:32.580 
who ironically was also a Walgreens

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.930 
who ironically was also a Walgreens
exclusive<00:06:33.450> last<00:06:33.720> year<00:06:34.080> so<00:06:34.860> the<00:06:35.070> two<00:06:35.250> kind<00:06:35.760> of

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:35.940 
exclusive last year so the two kind of

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.900 
exclusive last year so the two kind of
pair<00:06:36.450> up<00:06:36.600> kind<00:06:36.870> of<00:06:36.960> nicely<00:06:37.670> so<00:06:38.670> if<00:06:38.790> you're

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:38.910

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:40.590 
wondering where to display this ant-man

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:43.760 
wondering where to display this ant-man
on<00:06:40.830> your<00:06:40.980> shelves<00:06:41.430> I<00:06:41.550> mean<00:06:41.700> with<00:06:41.940> agent<00:06:42.680> and<00:06:43.680> he

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:43.770 
on your shelves I mean with agent and he

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.440 
on your shelves I mean with agent and he
doesn't<00:06:43.950> even<00:06:44.190> have<00:06:44.310> to<00:06:44.460> touch<00:06:44.760> him<00:06:44.820> to<00:06:45.150> defeat

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:45.450 
doesn't even have to touch him to defeat

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:47.660 
doesn't even have to touch him to defeat
him<00:06:45.600> and<00:06:45.720> vanquish<00:06:46.110> him<00:06:46.290> look<00:06:46.470> at<00:06:46.590> that<00:06:46.640> so<00:06:47.640> I

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:47.670 
him and vanquish him look at that so I

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:49.790 
him and vanquish him look at that so I
guess<00:06:47.910> with<00:06:48.120> agent<00:06:48.450> venom<00:06:48.540> would<00:06:48.900> be<00:06:49.020> a<00:06:49.050> pretty

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:49.800 
guess with agent venom would be a pretty

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.070 
guess with agent venom would be a pretty
decent<00:06:49.980> option<00:06:50.490> but<00:06:51.120> I<00:06:51.150> guess<00:06:51.390> he's<00:06:51.630> been<00:06:51.900> a

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 
decent option but I guess he's been a

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.430 
decent option but I guess he's been a
good<00:06:52.320> guy<00:06:52.470> and<00:06:52.830> he's<00:06:53.070> been<00:06:53.310> a<00:06:53.340> bad<00:06:53.580> guy<00:06:53.850> and

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:54.440 
good guy and he's been a bad guy and

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.410 
good guy and he's been a bad guy and
this<00:06:55.440> isn't<00:06:55.680> even<00:06:55.920> really<00:06:56.220> O'Grady<00:06:56.790> it's<00:06:57.180> a

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:57.420 
this isn't even really O'Grady it's a

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:00.080 
this isn't even really O'Grady it's a
clone<00:06:58.020> of<00:06:58.050> him<00:06:58.320> or<00:06:58.470> something<00:06:58.890> got<00:06:59.520> comics<00:06:59.940> are

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:00.090 
clone of him or something got comics are

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:01.610 
clone of him or something got comics are
so<00:07:00.210> convoluted<00:07:00.450> I<00:07:00.960> mean<00:07:01.110> I<00:07:01.140> love<00:07:01.440> them<00:07:01.560> for

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:01.620 
so convoluted I mean I love them for

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:02.780 
so convoluted I mean I love them for
that<00:07:01.830> but<00:07:02.070> at<00:07:02.160> the<00:07:02.220> same<00:07:02.280> time<00:07:02.580> when<00:07:02.730> you're

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:02.790 
that but at the same time when you're

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:04.640 
that but at the same time when you're
out<00:07:02.940> of<00:07:02.970> the<00:07:03.150> loop<00:07:03.330> it's<00:07:03.570> insanity<00:07:04.080> to<00:07:04.440> try<00:07:04.590> to

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:04.650 
out of the loop it's insanity to try to

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:07.880 
out of the loop it's insanity to try to
get<00:07:04.890> caught<00:07:05.100> up<00:07:05.130> with<00:07:05.630> so<00:07:06.680> that's<00:07:07.680> what<00:07:07.800> I'm

figure<00:07:14.510> so<00:07:15.510> if<00:07:15.690> you're<00:07:15.810> interested<00:07:16.170> in<00:07:16.260> them<00:07:16.410> I

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:16.620 
figure so if you're interested in them I

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.170 
figure so if you're interested in them I
would<00:07:17.130> head<00:07:17.280> over<00:07:17.460> to<00:07:17.550> Walgreens

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:18.180 
would head over to Walgreens

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.330 
would head over to Walgreens
your<00:07:18.870> store<00:07:19.110> if<00:07:19.290> it<00:07:19.410> doesn't<00:07:19.650> already<00:07:19.770> have<00:07:20.160> it

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:20.340 
your store if it doesn't already have it

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:21.800 
your store if it doesn't already have it
it<00:07:20.460> should<00:07:20.610> be<00:07:20.700> getting<00:07:20.820> it<00:07:21.060> really<00:07:21.360> soon

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:21.810 
it should be getting it really soon

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:25.730 
it should be getting it really soon
some<00:07:22.650> people<00:07:22.980> have<00:07:23.190> found<00:07:23.400> full<00:07:24.360> endcaps<00:07:25.350> full

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:25.740 
some people have found full endcaps full

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.860 
some people have found full endcaps full
of<00:07:25.920> him<00:07:26.070> other<00:07:27.000> people<00:07:27.240> have<00:07:27.330> found<00:07:27.450> displays

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:27.870 
of him other people have found displays

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:30.350 
of him other people have found displays
by<00:07:28.050> the<00:07:28.110> registers<00:07:28.590> I<00:07:28.620> just<00:07:29.280> happen<00:07:29.580> to<00:07:29.610> spot

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:30.360 
by the registers I just happen to spot

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.530 
by the registers I just happen to spot
two<00:07:30.810> of<00:07:31.020> them<00:07:31.250> sitting<00:07:32.250> on<00:07:32.370> a<00:07:32.400> shelf<00:07:32.550> randomly

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:33.540 
two of them sitting on a shelf randomly

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.960 
two of them sitting on a shelf randomly
at<00:07:34.290> the<00:07:34.530> photo<00:07:34.800> counter<00:07:35.370> it<00:07:35.670> would<00:07:35.790> have<00:07:35.880> been

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:35.970 
at the photo counter it would have been

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:38.870 
at the photo counter it would have been
very<00:07:36.000> easy<00:07:36.240> to<00:07:36.570> miss<00:07:36.750> so<00:07:36.960> I<00:07:36.990> got<00:07:37.200> lucky<00:07:37.880> so

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:38.880 
very easy to miss so I got lucky so

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.890 
very easy to miss so I got lucky so
again<00:07:39.300> I<00:07:40.400> think<00:07:41.400> he's<00:07:41.670> worth<00:07:41.820> picking<00:07:42.060> up<00:07:42.300> but

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:42.900 
again I think he's worth picking up but

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.530 
again I think he's worth picking up but
he's<00:07:43.230> not<00:07:43.380> the<00:07:43.650> most<00:07:43.860> essential<00:07:44.670> figure<00:07:45.390> in

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:45.540 
he's not the most essential figure in

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.570 
he's not the most essential figure in
the<00:07:45.630> world<00:07:45.840> since<00:07:46.260> I<00:07:46.560> mean<00:07:46.950> this<00:07:47.100> isn't<00:07:47.460> even

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:47.580 
the world since I mean this isn't even

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.420 
the world since I mean this isn't even
the<00:07:48.150> definitive<00:07:48.540> o'grady<00:07:49.260> a<00:07:49.410> man<00:07:49.800> costume<00:07:50.310> or

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:50.430 
the definitive o'grady a man costume or

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:52.400 
the definitive o'grady a man costume or
anything<00:07:50.760> but<00:07:51.270> I<00:07:51.300> think<00:07:51.450> he<00:07:51.660> looks<00:07:51.870> cool<00:07:52.110> and

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:52.410 
anything but I think he looks cool and

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:54.110 
anything but I think he looks cool and
honestly<00:07:52.890> when<00:07:53.100> it<00:07:53.190> comes<00:07:53.370> to<00:07:53.550> toys<00:07:53.850> and

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:54.120 
honestly when it comes to toys and

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.230 
honestly when it comes to toys and
figures<00:07:54.390> I<00:07:54.420> mean<00:07:54.780> looking<00:07:55.380> cool<00:07:55.560> is<00:07:55.860> enough<00:07:56.280> so

00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:57.240 
figures I mean looking cool is enough so

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.640 
figures I mean looking cool is enough so
