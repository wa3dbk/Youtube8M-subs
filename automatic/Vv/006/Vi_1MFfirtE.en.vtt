00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
really like to I don't want to compare

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.200 
really like to I don't want to compare
cases<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.079> lot<00:00:55.320> just<00:00:55.590> because<00:00:56.090> vision<00:00:57.090> for

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
cases a lot just because vision for

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.729 
cases a lot just because vision for
factors<00:00:57.510> are<00:00:57.629> involved<00:00:57.840> on<00:00:58.109> thick<00:00:58.320> very<00:00:58.500> fair

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
factors are involved on thick very fair

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.700 
factors are involved on thick very fair
but<00:00:59.370> this<00:00:59.820> is<00:01:00.000> almost<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.420> very<00:01:00.989> similar<00:01:01.260> design

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
but this is almost a very similar design

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.759 
but this is almost a very similar design
to<00:01:01.739> casemates<00:01:02.699> naked<00:01:03.390> case<00:01:03.600> because<00:01:04.470> it's<00:01:04.589> one

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
to casemates naked case because it's one

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.520 
to casemates naked case because it's one
big<00:01:04.970> big<00:01:05.970> plastic<00:01:06.210> case<00:01:06.600> with<00:01:06.810> with<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.229> full

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
big big plastic case with with the full

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
front coverage on the screen flow but

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.700 
front coverage on the screen flow but
i'm<00:01:09.750> just<00:01:09.930> gonna<00:01:10.020> start<00:01:10.229> this<00:01:10.350> review<00:01:10.500> by

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
naked naked case by case mate if you've

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.880 
naked naked case by case mate if you've
seen<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:15.659> review<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.110> would<00:01:16.290> know<00:01:16.439> why<00:01:16.590> so

seen that review you would know why so

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.649 
seen that review you would know why so
go<00:01:17.280> check<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.670> few<00:01:17.939> got<00:01:18.090> of<00:01:18.180> people<00:01:18.420> if<00:01:18.570> you

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
go check that a few got of people if you

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.560 
go check that a few got of people if you
want<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.869> see<00:01:19.020> my<00:01:19.110> reasons<00:01:19.409> why<00:01:19.500> so<00:01:20.250> basically

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
want to see my reasons why so basically

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.810 
want to see my reasons why so basically
they<00:01:21.570> did<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.780> really<00:01:21.810> good<00:01:22.110> job<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.820> redesign

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
they did a really good job of redesign

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.390 
they did a really good job of redesign
this<00:01:24.030> case<00:01:24.680> this<00:01:25.680> is<00:01:25.890> slightly<00:01:26.189> different

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
this case this is slightly different

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.890 
this case this is slightly different
from<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.729> old<00:01:26.759> because<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.240> original<00:01:27.330> iphone

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
from the old because the original iphone

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.080 
from the old because the original iphone
obviously<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:29.340> back<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.640> its<00:01:29.790> type<00:01:29.970> of

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
obviously is the back of its type of

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.120 
obviously is the back of its type of
shape<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.500> just<00:01:31.740> gonna<00:01:31.890> have<00:01:32.040> to

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
shape so so I just gonna have to

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.740 
shape so so I just gonna have to
redesign<00:01:32.430> these<00:01:32.759> cases<00:01:33.210> be<00:01:33.299> able<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.509> fit<00:01:33.659> the

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
redesign these cases be able to fit the

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.539 
redesign these cases be able to fit the
iphone<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.619> could<00:01:34.799> use<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.340> same

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
iphone and it could use the same

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.100 
iphone and it could use the same
original<00:01:35.820> enclosure<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.810> all<00:01:36.960> those

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
original enclosure and all those

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.330 
original enclosure and all those
different<00:01:37.380> things<00:01:37.560> like<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.040> but<00:01:38.220> they

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
different things like that but they

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.950 
different things like that but they
actually<00:01:38.460> redesigned<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.390> completely<00:01:39.780> and

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
actually redesigned it completely and

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.200 
actually redesigned it completely and
the<00:01:40.500> way<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:40.770> actually<00:01:40.860> snaps<00:01:41.280> together<00:01:41.460> it's

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
the way it actually snaps together it's

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.539 
the way it actually snaps together it's
much<00:01:42.600> less<00:01:43.140> before<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.070> think<00:01:44.280> they<00:01:44.369> did<00:01:44.520> it

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
much less before and I think they did it

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.130 
much less before and I think they did it
really<00:01:44.729> they<00:01:45.090> made<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.270> really<00:01:45.450> good<00:01:45.600> choice<00:01:45.810> on

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
really they made a really good choice on

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.840 
really they made a really good choice on

whole the whole top section here is cut

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.720 
whole the whole top section here is cut
off<00:03:26.900> for<00:03:27.109> the<00:03:27.169> sensors<00:03:27.560> so<00:03:28.010> there's<00:03:28.220> no<00:03:28.340> block

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
off for the sensors so there's no block

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.129 
off for the sensors so there's no block
in<00:03:28.910> there<00:03:29.030> sort<00:03:29.329> of<00:03:29.359> using<00:03:29.720> our<00:03:29.810> phone<00:03:29.959> this

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:30.139 
in there sort of using our phone this

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:31.659 
in there sort of using our phone this
doesn't<00:03:30.470> it<00:03:30.859> doesn't<00:03:30.949> automatically<00:03:31.489> go<00:03:31.639> to

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:31.669 
doesn't it doesn't automatically go to

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:33.309 
doesn't it doesn't automatically go to
black<00:03:32.060> you're<00:03:32.269> going<00:03:32.449> it<00:03:32.510> when<00:03:33.019> it's<00:03:33.169> not

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
black you're going it when it's not

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:34.659 
black you're going it when it's not
against<00:03:33.620> you<00:03:33.739> here<00:03:33.859> because<00:03:34.190> that's<00:03:34.519> what

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:34.669 
against you here because that's what

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:36.460 
against you here because that's what
their<00:03:34.790> proximity<00:03:35.090> sensors<00:03:35.540> for<00:03:35.750> when<00:03:36.319> you're

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
their proximity sensors for when you're

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.140 
their proximity sensors for when you're
on<00:03:36.560> a<00:03:36.590> phone<00:03:36.799> call<00:03:37.040> it<00:03:37.190> disengages<00:03:37.639> the<00:03:37.940> touch

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
on a phone call it disengages the touch

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.159 
on a phone call it disengages the touch
screen<00:03:38.239> so<00:03:38.449> you<00:03:38.480> won't<00:03:38.629> touch<00:03:38.720> with<00:03:38.900> your<00:03:38.989> face

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:39.169 
screen so you won't touch with your face

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:42.189 
screen so you won't touch with your face
so<00:03:39.889> that<00:03:39.919> works<00:03:40.220> out<00:03:40.310> really<00:03:40.370> well<00:03:40.930> so<00:03:41.930> overall

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:42.199 
so that works out really well so overall

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:44.259 
so that works out really well so overall
the<00:03:42.859> craftsmanship<00:03:43.310> of<00:03:43.549> this<00:03:43.699> is<00:03:43.910> really<00:03:44.060> nice

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
the craftsmanship of this is really nice

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.509 
the craftsmanship of this is really nice
I<00:03:44.510> like<00:03:44.690> it<00:03:44.720> it's<00:03:45.139> feels<00:03:45.829> smooth<00:03:46.129> it<00:03:46.310> feels

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
I like it it's feels smooth it feels

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:48.430 
I like it it's feels smooth it feels
solid<00:03:47.000> doesn't<00:03:47.299> have<00:03:47.480> a<00:03:47.510> lot<00:03:47.690> of<00:03:47.720> flex<00:03:48.049> to<00:03:48.260> when

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
solid doesn't have a lot of flex to when

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.080 
solid doesn't have a lot of flex to when
you<00:03:48.530> squeeze<00:03:48.799> it<00:03:48.980> it<00:03:49.099> feels<00:03:49.639> like<00:03:49.760> it's<00:03:49.910> really

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
you squeeze it it feels like it's really

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.619 
you squeeze it it feels like it's really
snug<00:03:50.540> on<00:03:50.780> the<00:03:51.109> phone<00:03:51.319> itself<00:03:52.449> what<00:03:53.449> are<00:03:53.540> the

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
does it gets kind of annoying it bothers

00:03:57.739 --> 00:03:59.439 
does it gets kind of annoying it bothers
me<00:03:57.769> once<00:03:57.980> in<00:03:58.069> a<00:03:58.129> while<00:03:58.250> but<00:03:58.400> it's<00:03:58.609> not<00:03:58.790> a<00:03:58.819> super

00:03:59.439 --> 00:03:59.449 
me once in a while but it's not a super

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:01.479 
me once in a while but it's not a super
big<00:03:59.599> deal<00:03:59.750> is<00:03:59.930> this<00:04:00.799> top<00:04:01.069> is<00:04:01.099> right<00:04:01.370> here

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
big deal is this top is right here

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:02.890 
big deal is this top is right here
there's<00:04:01.639> actually<00:04:01.909> a<00:04:01.940> little<00:04:02.030> hook<00:04:02.329> on<00:04:02.359> the

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
there's actually a little hook on the

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.360 
there's actually a little hook on the
other<00:04:03.079> side<00:04:03.290> of<00:04:03.319> this<00:04:03.440> the<00:04:03.590> hell<00:04:04.099> goes<00:04:04.250> to

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
other side of this the hell goes to

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.789 
other side of this the hell goes to
piece<00:04:04.519> it<00:04:04.549> together<00:04:04.730> like<00:04:05.150> but<00:04:05.930> so<00:04:06.169> so

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
piece it together like but so so

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:08.080 
piece it together like but so so
sometimes<00:04:07.280> when<00:04:07.459> you're<00:04:07.609> trying<00:04:07.729> to<00:04:07.819> press

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
sometimes when you're trying to press

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.490 
sometimes when you're trying to press
your<00:04:08.329> stand<00:04:08.599> when<00:04:08.690> I<00:04:08.750> switch<00:04:08.959> your<00:04:09.139> button

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
your stand when I switch your button

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.099 
your stand when I switch your button
it's<00:04:10.370> easy<00:04:10.579> to<00:04:10.819> like<00:04:11.000> spread<00:04:11.359> these<00:04:11.510> these<00:04:11.840> two

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:12.109 
it's easy to like spread these these two

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:14.289 
it's easy to like spread these these two
pieces<00:04:12.290> apart<00:04:12.769> and<00:04:13.250> it<00:04:13.790> doesn't<00:04:14.030> seem<00:04:14.090> to<00:04:14.180> be

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 
pieces apart and it doesn't seem to be

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:16.689 
pieces apart and it doesn't seem to be
doing<00:04:14.389> right<00:04:14.540> now<00:04:14.599> oh<00:04:14.959> there<00:04:15.620> it<00:04:15.680> is<00:04:15.769> so<00:04:16.519> like

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:16.699 
doing right now oh there it is so like

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:18.729 
doing right now oh there it is so like
if<00:04:16.729> I'm<00:04:16.909> pressing<00:04:17.299> my<00:04:17.419> standby<00:04:17.750> switch<00:04:17.930> really

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
if I'm pressing my standby switch really

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.029 
if I'm pressing my standby switch really
hard<00:04:18.979> the<00:04:19.340> top<00:04:19.549> snaps<00:04:20.120> apart<00:04:20.450> like<00:04:20.539> this

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
hard the top snaps apart like this

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:23.430 
hard the top snaps apart like this
instead<00:04:22.039> a<00:04:22.099> little<00:04:22.250> hook<00:04:22.310> right<00:04:22.460> there

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
instead a little hook right there

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.750 
instead a little hook right there
because<00:04:23.650> you<00:04:23.830> kind<00:04:24.010> of<00:04:24.040> the<00:04:24.220> squeeze<00:04:24.550> it<00:04:24.670> back

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
because you kind of the squeeze it back

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.220 
because you kind of the squeeze it back
together<00:04:24.910> it<00:04:25.600> doesn't<00:04:25.750> happen<00:04:25.900> all<00:04:26.110> the<00:04:26.140> time

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
together it doesn't happen all the time

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.550 
together it doesn't happen all the time
but<00:04:26.650> sometimes<00:04:26.710> it<00:04:27.280> does<00:04:27.600> i'm<00:04:28.600> sure<00:04:28.930> you<00:04:29.440> know

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
but sometimes it does i'm sure you know

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.250 
but sometimes it does i'm sure you know
some<00:04:29.800> cases<00:04:30.280> some<00:04:30.580> cases<00:04:31.150> probably<00:04:31.930> don't<00:04:32.200> do

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
some cases some cases probably don't do

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.720 
some cases some cases probably don't do
that<00:04:32.410> at<00:04:32.500> all<00:04:32.620> maybe<00:04:33.070> mine's<00:04:33.310> just<00:04:33.430> a<00:04:33.550> little

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
that at all maybe mine's just a little

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.510 
that at all maybe mine's just a little
bit<00:04:33.850> softer<00:04:34.300> the<00:04:34.510> hook<00:04:34.660> isn't<00:04:34.840> quite<00:04:35.520> right

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
bit softer the hook isn't quite right

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.520 
bit softer the hook isn't quite right
out<00:04:36.670> it<00:04:36.850> isn't<00:04:37.180> dead<00:04:37.390> on<00:04:37.510> right<00:04:37.540> there<00:04:37.780> so<00:04:38.470> it

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
out it isn't dead on right there so it

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.630 
out it isn't dead on right there so it
might<00:04:38.620> just<00:04:38.740> be<00:04:38.860> my<00:04:38.980> case<00:04:39.190> but<00:04:39.430> that's<00:04:39.550> not

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
might just be my case but that's not

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.070 
might just be my case but that's not
really<00:04:39.790> a<00:04:39.910> big<00:04:40.060> deal<00:04:40.120> but<00:04:40.540> it<00:04:40.660> does<00:04:40.780> that<00:04:40.930> once

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
really a big deal but it does that once

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.050 
really a big deal but it does that once
in<00:04:41.200> a<00:04:41.260> while<00:04:41.410> and<00:04:41.950> i<00:04:42.220> just<00:04:42.250> noticed<00:04:42.640> when<00:04:43.030> i

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
in a while and i just noticed when i

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.310 
in a while and i just noticed when i
press<00:04:43.270> the<00:04:43.390> sandwich<00:04:43.660> which<00:04:43.810> really<00:04:43.990> harder

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
press the sandwich which really harder

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.960 
press the sandwich which really harder
they'd<00:04:44.470> forces<00:04:45.310> in<00:04:45.400> the<00:04:45.490> spread<00:04:45.760> apart<00:04:45.910> a

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
they'd forces in the spread apart a

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.050 
they'd forces in the spread apart a
little<00:04:46.030> bit<00:04:46.150> right<00:04:46.300> there<00:04:47.700> besides<00:04:48.700> that<00:04:48.790> the

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
little bit right there besides that the

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.730

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
there's always happened but sometimes I

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.210 
there's always happened but sometimes I
had<00:05:46.900> noticed<00:05:47.080> it<00:05:47.320> does<00:05:47.470> act<00:05:47.710> a<00:05:47.800> little<00:05:47.919> funny

so it's not like I'm percent dead on I'm
not<00:05:50.350> sure<00:05:50.410> why<00:05:50.710> it's<00:05:50.890> only<00:05:51.040> on<00:05:51.100> the<00:05:51.160> top<00:05:51.310> it

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
just something I keep in mind to think

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.340 
just something I keep in mind to think
about<00:06:00.360> like<00:06:01.360> I<00:06:01.450> said<00:06:01.570> that<00:06:01.720> part<00:06:01.900> of<00:06:01.990> a<00:06:02.140> prayer

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:02.350 
about like I said that part of a prayer

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:03.990 
about like I said that part of a prayer
is<00:06:02.380> an<00:06:02.560> issue<00:06:02.740> for<00:06:02.890> every<00:06:03.280> case<00:06:03.490> some<00:06:03.730> cases

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 
is an issue for every case some cases

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.930 
is an issue for every case some cases
might<00:06:04.150> be<00:06:04.300> you<00:06:04.600> know<00:06:04.720> a<00:06:05.250> burden<00:06:06.250> others<00:06:06.370> as<00:06:06.730> far

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:06.940 
might be you know a burden others as far

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:08.340 
might be you know a burden others as far
as<00:06:07.090> because<00:06:07.480> we're<00:06:07.630> not<00:06:07.810> there<00:06:07.960> nine<00:06:08.110> hundred

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.350 
as because we're not there nine hundred

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:09.930 
as because we're not there nine hundred
percent<00:06:08.620> identical<00:06:09.220> every<00:06:09.400> time<00:06:09.550> I<00:06:09.580> come<00:06:09.790> out

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:09.940 
percent identical every time I come out

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.510 
percent identical every time I come out
of<00:06:10.030> the<00:06:10.270> factory<00:06:10.650> but<00:06:11.650> besides<00:06:12.280> those<00:06:12.370> two

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 
of the factory but besides those two

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.860 
of the factory but besides those two
issues<00:06:12.640> I<00:06:12.880> haven't<00:06:13.120> had<00:06:13.180> any<00:06:13.570> other<00:06:13.720> problems

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:13.870 
issues I haven't had any other problems

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.780 
issues I haven't had any other problems
with<00:06:14.110> it<00:06:14.320> and<00:06:14.500> so<00:06:14.800> I<00:06:14.830> think<00:06:15.220> those<00:06:15.550> two<00:06:15.580> issues

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:15.790 
with it and so I think those two issues

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:18.060 
with it and so I think those two issues
aren't<00:06:16.060> glued<00:06:16.390> that<00:06:16.600> was<00:06:16.720> big<00:06:16.870> of<00:06:16.900> a<00:06:16.990> deal<00:06:17.110> I

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:18.070 
aren't glued that was big of a deal I

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:19.800 
aren't glued that was big of a deal I
would<00:06:18.940> definitely<00:06:19.030> recommend<00:06:19.270> this<00:06:19.480> case<00:06:19.690> to

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:19.810 
would definitely recommend this case to

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.870 
would definitely recommend this case to
anybody<00:06:20.110> this<00:06:20.290> case<00:06:20.500> retails<00:06:20.860> for<00:06:20.919> 34<00:06:21.640> 99

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:21.880 
anybody this case retails for 34 99
