in the corner right well let's pop up an
image<00:02:07.439> with<00:02:08.039> golden<00:02:09.000> Freddy's<00:02:09.440> endoskeleton

standing there well if you look back at

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.340 
standing there well if you look back at
same<00:02:14.100> location<00:02:14.280> of<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.940> shadow<00:02:15.240> it's<00:02:15.630> the

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
same location of the shadow it's the

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.880

looks the same guys so in conclusion i'm

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.990 
looks the same guys so in conclusion i'm
pretty<00:02:20.160> sure<00:02:20.400> it's<00:02:20.580> absolutely<00:02:21.240> nothing<00:02:21.800> okay

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
pretty sure it's absolutely nothing okay

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.340 
pretty sure it's absolutely nothing okay
because<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.030> lot<00:02:24.450> of<00:02:24.480> people<00:02:24.810> seem<00:02:24.959> to<00:02:24.990> think<00:02:25.080> is

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
because a lot of people seem to think is

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.340 
because a lot of people seem to think is
going<00:02:25.620> Freddy's<00:02:25.920> endoskeleton<00:02:26.790> but<00:02:27.630> if<00:02:27.900> it

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
going Freddy's endoskeleton but if it

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.680 
going Freddy's endoskeleton but if it
really<00:02:28.560> was<00:02:28.800> golden<00:02:29.370> Freddy's<00:02:29.700> endoskeleton

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
really was golden Freddy's endoskeleton

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.990 
really was golden Freddy's endoskeleton
why<00:02:31.050> is<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.590> same<00:02:31.800> shadow<00:02:32.100> still<00:02:32.520> there<00:02:32.760> when

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
why is the same shadow still there when

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.120 
why is the same shadow still there when
the<00:02:33.150> endoskeleton<00:02:33.690> is<00:02:34.140> clearly<00:02:34.470> standing<00:02:35.010> in

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
the endoskeleton is clearly standing in

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.770 
the endoskeleton is clearly standing in

is<00:02:40.709> there<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.430> shadow<00:02:41.730> remains<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.630> same

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
is there the shadow remains the same

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.440 
is there the shadow remains the same
when<00:02:43.770> the<00:02:43.800> mango<00:02:44.370> is<00:02:44.520> there<00:02:44.760> it<00:02:44.970> remains<00:02:45.300> the

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
scott just stumbled upon and was

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.370 
scott just stumbled upon and was
accidentally<00:02:53.610> made<00:02:53.820> who<00:02:54.060> knows<00:02:54.269> or<00:02:54.870> it<00:02:55.200> could

accidentally made who knows or it could

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.720 
accidentally made who knows or it could
actually<00:02:55.530> just<00:02:55.739> be<00:02:56.130> a<00:02:56.390> shadow<00:02:57.390> of<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:57.870> balloon

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
actually just be a shadow of the balloon

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.930 
actually just be a shadow of the balloon
for<00:02:59.730> all<00:02:59.880> we<00:03:00.060> know<00:03:00.269> but<00:03:01.170> yeah<00:03:01.610> now<00:03:02.610> let's<00:03:02.820> move

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
for all we know but yeah now let's move

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.910 
for all we know but yeah now let's move
on<00:03:03.120> to<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.420> next<00:03:03.450> theory<00:03:04.080> that<00:03:04.230> i<00:03:04.290> hear<00:03:04.680> a<00:03:04.709> lot

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
on to the next theory that i hear a lot

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.449 
on to the next theory that i hear a lot
so<00:03:05.340> everyone's<00:03:05.970> asking<00:03:06.320> where<00:03:07.320> is<00:03:07.459> chicas

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
beak now let me use a comparing

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.400 
beak now let me use a comparing
technique<00:03:13.440> to<00:03:13.860> answer<00:03:14.400> this<00:03:14.640> so<00:03:15.050> we<00:03:16.050> all<00:03:16.200> know

Freddy fazbear has a hat correct well

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.060 
Freddy fazbear has a hat correct well
why<00:03:21.360> doesn't<00:03:21.750> he<00:03:21.959> have<00:03:21.989> a<00:03:22.200> hat<00:03:22.560> when<00:03:22.920> he

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
why doesn't he have a hat when he

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.819 
why doesn't he have a hat when he
attacks<00:03:23.519> you<00:03:23.820> right<00:03:24.390> that's<00:03:24.959> like<00:03:25.290> insane

attacks you right that's like insane

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.949 
attacks you right that's like insane
isn't<00:03:26.160> it<00:03:26.310> like<00:03:26.579> where<00:03:27.209> does<00:03:27.360> this<00:03:27.480> hat<00:03:27.690> go

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
isn't it like where does this hat go

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
does the Hat fall off or wait guys I

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.840 
does the Hat fall off or wait guys I
think<00:03:32.579> I<00:03:32.640> figured<00:03:32.940> it<00:03:33.030> out<00:03:33.739> maybe<00:03:34.739> the<00:03:35.280> Hat<00:03:35.579> is

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850

think I figured it out maybe the Hat is
secretly<00:03:36.450> an<00:03:36.660> animatronic<00:03:37.200> in<00:03:37.920> that<00:03:38.760> shadow

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
secretly an animatronic in that shadow

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.870 
secretly an animatronic in that shadow
