we've done with the x6 here we have
turned<00:00:47.870> that<00:00:48.050> dream<00:00:48.379> into<00:00:48.710> reality<00:00:49.780> take<00:00:50.780> a

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
that well I mean as a coupe the

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.270 
that well I mean as a coupe the
important<00:01:02.480> thing<00:01:02.629> is<00:01:02.809> to<00:01:03.379> have<00:01:03.500> this<00:01:03.679> roofline

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
important thing is to have this roofline

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.279 
important thing is to have this roofline
sloping<00:01:04.910> down<00:01:05.059> so<00:01:05.330> much<00:01:05.509> and<00:01:05.810> what<00:01:05.929> people

00:01:06.279 --> 00:01:06.289 
sloping down so much and what people

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:08.350 
sloping down so much and what people
will<00:01:06.440> probably<00:01:06.740> be<00:01:06.890> wondering<00:01:07.100> is<00:01:07.640> can<00:01:08.030> a<00:01:08.060> tall

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
will probably be wondering is can a tall

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.109 
will probably be wondering is can a tall
person<00:01:08.630> maybe<00:01:09.140> like<00:01:09.440> myself<00:01:09.679> or<00:01:10.160> to<00:01:10.399> fit<00:01:10.640> in<00:01:10.820> so

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
person maybe like myself or to fit in so

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:12.999 
person maybe like myself or to fit in so
it<00:01:11.330> was<00:01:11.450> really<00:01:11.600> to<00:01:11.810> show<00:01:11.990> that<00:01:12.200> is<00:01:12.440> to<00:01:12.590> just<00:01:12.619> do

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
it was really to show that is to just do

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:17.680 
it was really to show that is to just do
it<00:01:13.130> I<00:01:13.250> guess<00:01:15.250> plenty<00:01:16.250> of<00:01:16.459> space<00:01:16.759> and<00:01:16.789> plenty<00:01:17.420> of

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
it I guess plenty of space and plenty of

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.460 
it I guess plenty of space and plenty of
space<00:01:17.929> and<00:01:19.209> that<00:01:20.209> makes<00:01:20.450> the<00:01:20.599> x6<00:01:20.990> a<00:01:21.140> really

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
space and that makes the x6 a really

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.410 
space and that makes the x6 a really
practical<00:01:21.649> coupe<00:01:22.220> a<00:01:22.399> it's<00:01:22.640> a<00:01:22.759> four-door<00:01:23.179> -

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
practical coupe a it's a four-door -

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
we are in the design team very happy

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.880 
we are in the design team very happy
with<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.729> way<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.090> roof<00:01:30.540> right<00:01:30.750> now<00:01:30.810> honey

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
with the way the roof right now honey

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.860 
with the way the roof right now honey
this<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.430> roof<00:01:32.700> line<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.210> also<00:01:33.360> this<00:01:33.660> this

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:33.870 
this is a roof line and also this this

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.770 
this is a roof line and also this this
bromine<00:01:34.820> accentuating<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:35.940> it's<00:01:36.420> something

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
bromine accentuating it it's something

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.719 
bromine accentuating it it's something
that<00:01:36.960> we've<00:01:37.140> only<00:01:37.350> ever<00:01:37.619> done<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.400> let's<00:01:38.550> say

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
that we've only ever done and let's say

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.000 
that we've only ever done and let's say
at<00:01:38.910> the<00:01:39.060> sixth<00:01:39.510> series<00:01:39.690> and<00:01:40.260> now<00:01:40.560> we<00:01:40.619> were<00:01:40.860> able

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
at the sixth series and now we were able

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.090 
at the sixth series and now we were able
to<00:01:41.160> do<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.520> for<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.760> first<00:01:42.030> time<00:01:42.300> on<00:01:43.080> an<00:01:43.440> SAV

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
to do it for the first time on an SAV

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.010 
to do it for the first time on an SAV
and<00:01:44.400> that<00:01:44.850> that's<00:01:45.240> what<00:01:45.450> makes<00:01:45.660> this<00:01:45.810> vehicle

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
and that that's what makes this vehicle

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.800 
and that that's what makes this vehicle
unique<00:01:46.619> when<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:47.430> walk<00:01:47.640> around<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.240> whole<00:01:48.420> of

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
unique when you walk around the whole of

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.359
