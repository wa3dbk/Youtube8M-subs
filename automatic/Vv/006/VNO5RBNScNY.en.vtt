the<00:02:33.000> ball<00:02:33.209> is<00:02:33.239> like<00:02:33.599> a<00:02:33.630> magnet<00:02:34.200> when<00:02:34.590> I<00:02:34.650> lob

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
the ball is like a magnet when I lob

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.580 
the ball is like a magnet when I lob
deep<00:02:35.370> it's<00:02:35.700> gonna<00:02:35.910> pull<00:02:36.299> me<00:02:36.510> up<00:02:36.660> closer<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.319> the

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
deep it's gonna pull me up closer to the

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.309 
deep it's gonna pull me up closer to the
baseline<00:02:38.099> for<00:02:38.430> an<00:02:38.549> offense<00:02:39.060> look<00:02:39.420> when<00:02:39.989> I<00:02:40.019> lob

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
baseline for an offense look when I lob

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.039 
baseline for an offense look when I lob
short<00:02:40.709> it's<00:02:40.980> gonna<00:02:41.099> push<00:02:41.489> me<00:02:41.790> back<00:02:42.000> closer<00:02:42.810> to

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
and wait for a better ball we need a

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.750 
and wait for a better ball we need a
couple<00:03:00.780> criteria<00:03:01.500> in<00:03:01.650> place<00:03:01.920> before<00:03:02.250> we<00:03:02.519> pull

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
couple criteria in place before we pull

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.729 
couple criteria in place before we pull
the<00:03:02.790> trigger<00:03:02.910> on<00:03:03.329> the<00:03:03.510> drive<00:03:03.750> and<00:03:04.109> those<00:03:04.530> are

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
the trigger on the drive and those are

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.559 
the trigger on the drive and those are
going<00:03:04.890> to<00:03:04.950> be<00:03:05.130> that<00:03:05.640> we<00:03:05.880> could<00:03:06.060> be<00:03:06.209> at<00:03:06.359> or

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
going to be that we could be at or

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.750

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
inside the baseline we get a short ball

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.789 
inside the baseline we get a short ball
and<00:03:09.090> preferably<00:03:09.780> we<00:03:09.989> have<00:03:10.079> an<00:03:10.170> opponent<00:03:10.440> out
