00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:19.470
 Yes I usually see the code when I hit it 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:24.419
 Well , if you look at our site, you know something . 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.609
 There is a problem with the code table of Code 7 operating indicators under its first 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:29.720
 The poetry is the one who worries the most. 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.720
 c hit the code 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:38.820
 Well f geudak code got to go do this seven nulreugo in this here 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.820
 Let's put it back and have it again. 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:47.650
 Hold your c-code again and give it to me with your pet music . 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:54.670
 Problems now 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:55.180
 There is one important thing to do when you practice here . 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.199
 One. 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:02.350
 I'm hitting this place is said to drink Wondering how do you sell only this 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:05.050
 But this is how you get your finger first . 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:11.770
 Yogar, the chief officer , 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:14.280
 I got this. Then I press this and I'm holding my hand until it's loud. 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.280
 Sound 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.030
 Like this 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:29.640
 Pretend this to be fine so that you can automatically recognize the code on your finger with this 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.430
 This is the burden of 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.430
 So just now Crank 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.290
 2 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:47.260
 That's why students 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.260
 On finger 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:01.330
 When you practice in this way, your fingers will have strength and end up performing again. 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:03.580
 If you hit a little more than a week on your left hurting, 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:09.910
 I do not get so hurt later. 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:13.780
 The important thing is to change this code once and stroke it like this 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.790
 It's going to take quite a long time if you go and see it once. 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:20.700
 Do not practice 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.700
 I'm hitting the code directly in this way when 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:29.620
 But how are you going 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:35.650
 Stroke-free spot 4 platinum 1 2 neta 10:00 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:37.360
 Then practice this so that you can learn to code richly into reality 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.360
 You 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.360
 U 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:46.859
 Later, the code is fairly accurate in the zone 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:46.859
 I'm not quite clear exactly when the stroke code 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:59.209
 Thank you. 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:06.580
 The jade's fingers have strength 2 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:06.580
 You can do this three times at once 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.980
 Ah , the book is very helpful when you practice the most.
