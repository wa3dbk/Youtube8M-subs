00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
developmental sequences that happen just

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.040 
developmental sequences that happen just
like<00:02:13.460> with<00:02:13.700> infants<00:02:14.210> they<00:02:14.360> have<00:02:14.480> milestones

they<00:03:43.680> provide<00:03:44.010> the<00:03:44.189> calories<00:03:44.609> for<00:03:44.819> fuel<00:03:45.060> with

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
they provide the calories for fuel with

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.089 
they provide the calories for fuel with
all<00:03:45.900> those<00:03:45.989> good<00:03:46.199> carbohydrates<00:03:46.799> but<00:03:46.979> then

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
all those good carbohydrates but then

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:51.710 
for recovery for those muscles that need
it<00:03:51.030> afterwards

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
it afterwards

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.719 
it afterwards
get<00:03:52.079> it<00:03:52.169> in<00:03:52.290> 30<00:03:52.590> minutes<00:03:52.889> after<00:03:53.159> exercise<00:03:53.549> with

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
a little protein and then thirdly they

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:57.920 
a little protein and then thirdly they
provide<00:03:56.220> thousands<00:03:56.819> of<00:03:56.879> antioxidants<00:03:57.720> which

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
provide thousands of antioxidants which

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.869 
provide thousands of antioxidants which
aren't<00:03:58.199> calories<00:03:58.709> or<00:03:58.889> carbohydrates<00:03:59.669> and

foundation every day it starts with

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:21.680 
foundation every day it starts with
eating<00:04:20.519> the<00:04:20.549> real<00:04:20.789> thing<00:04:21.000> making<00:04:21.299> sure<00:04:21.570> that

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
eating the real thing making sure that

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.960

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
many fruits and vegetables as possible

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.890 
many fruits and vegetables as possible
and<00:04:25.710> filling<00:04:26.070> that<00:04:26.159> plate<00:04:26.430> half<00:04:26.669> full<00:04:26.909> but<00:04:27.780> it

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
and filling that plate half full but it

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.540 
and filling that plate half full but it
also<00:04:28.080> comes<00:04:28.560> about<00:04:28.800> the<00:04:29.010> fact<00:04:29.190> that<00:04:29.280> we

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
also comes about the fact that we

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.279 
also comes about the fact that we
realize<00:04:29.970> that's<00:04:30.150> not<00:04:30.330> always<00:04:30.659> possible<00:04:30.870> and

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
realize that's not always possible and

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:33.080 
realize that's not always possible and
then<00:04:31.680> we<00:04:31.889> know<00:04:32.039> how<00:04:32.070> difficult<00:04:32.460> that<00:04:32.760> can<00:04:33.030> be

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
then we know how difficult that can be

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.360 
then we know how difficult that can be
