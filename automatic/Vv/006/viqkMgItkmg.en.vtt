really cool I think and there's a

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:54.500 
really cool I think and there's a
program<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.780> does<00:00:51.929> it<00:00:52.050> all<00:00:53.059> right<00:00:54.059> there

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510

it's called cydia and just click on the
city<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.489> takes<00:00:59.729> me<00:00:59.819> to<00:01:00.409> cydia<00:01:01.409> main<00:01:01.769> page

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
city and it takes me to cydia main page

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.479

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
sometimes takes a long time since it's a

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.260 
sometimes takes a long time since it's a
hack<00:01:05.670> but<00:01:05.970> it's<00:01:06.750> definitely<00:01:07.170> worth<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.270> I

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
hack but it's definitely worth it and I
