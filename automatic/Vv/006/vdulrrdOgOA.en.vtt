sets setups and let's see the guys go

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.199 
sets setups and let's see the guys go
from<00:02:48.110> here<00:02:51.670> first<00:02:52.670> thing<00:02:52.820> they're<00:02:52.940> gonna<00:02:53.000> do

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
from here first thing they're gonna do

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:54.670 
from here first thing they're gonna do
is<00:02:53.330> take<00:02:53.480> that<00:02:53.510> cage<00:02:53.840> panel<00:02:54.200> and<00:02:54.290> just<00:02:54.440> simply

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
is take that cage panel and just simply

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.949

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
cage now as you can see these guys are

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:26.800 
cage now as you can see these guys are
setting<00:04:25.970> up<00:04:26.000> this<00:04:26.120> case

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
setting up this case

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.209 
setting up this case
another<00:04:27.289> thing<00:04:27.469> I<00:04:27.560> like<00:04:27.680> to<00:04:27.770> point<00:04:27.800> out<00:04:28.069> are

00:04:28.209 --> 00:04:28.219 
another thing I like to point out are

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:29.559 
another thing I like to point out are
these<00:04:28.280> tails<00:04:28.580> on<00:04:28.819> the<00:04:28.909> end<00:04:29.060> of<00:04:29.180> your<00:04:29.240> corner

00:04:29.559 --> 00:04:29.569 
these tails on the end of your corner

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:31.209 
these tails on the end of your corner
pads<00:04:29.780> what<00:04:30.289> these<00:04:30.409> do<00:04:30.560> is<00:04:30.590> these<00:04:30.800> minimize

00:04:31.209 --> 00:04:31.219 
pads what these do is these minimize

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:33.339 
pads what these do is these minimize
friction<00:04:31.520> and<00:04:31.909> allow<00:04:32.419> the<00:04:32.479> cage<00:04:32.810> to<00:04:33.020> flow

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:33.349 
friction and allow the cage to flow

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:36.519 
friction and allow the cage to flow
easily<00:04:33.710> on<00:04:34.280> top<00:04:34.550> of<00:04:34.729> your<00:04:34.849> existing<00:04:34.969> maps<00:04:35.529> it's

00:04:36.519 --> 00:04:36.529 
easily on top of your existing maps it's

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:37.839 
easily on top of your existing maps it's
it's<00:04:36.800> a<00:04:36.889> great<00:04:37.039> little<00:04:37.340> feature<00:04:37.460> that<00:04:37.639> the

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
cage train the team had put together and

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.350 
cage train the team had put together and
it's<00:04:40.909> exciting<00:04:42.999> another<00:04:43.999> thing<00:04:44.240> that's

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
it's exciting another thing that's

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.700 
it's exciting another thing that's
really<00:04:44.479> exciting<00:04:44.930> about<00:04:45.169> this<00:04:45.349> cage<00:04:45.529> is<00:04:45.680> the

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
really exciting about this cage is the

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.219 
really exciting about this cage is the
fact<00:04:45.949> that<00:04:46.039> it<00:04:46.189> stores<00:04:46.550> easily<00:04:46.900> you<00:04:47.900> just<00:04:48.080> have

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:48.229 
fact that it stores easily you just have

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:50.320 
fact that it stores easily you just have
it<00:04:48.379> stacked<00:04:48.949> up<00:04:49.159> against<00:04:49.490> a<00:04:49.550> wall<00:04:49.759> you<00:04:50.029> can

it stacked up against a wall you can
also<00:04:50.509> expand<00:04:51.050> it<00:04:51.199> and<00:04:51.319> lay<00:04:51.499> it<00:04:51.590> out<00:04:51.680> flat

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:52.009 
also expand it and lay it out flat

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:53.980 
also expand it and lay it out flat
against<00:04:52.460> your<00:04:52.520> wall<00:04:52.729> in<00:04:53.360> a<00:04:53.449> situation<00:04:53.900> like

that I could have this cage laid out

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.830 
that I could have this cage laid out
flat<00:04:55.610> like<00:04:55.639> you<00:04:55.909> see<00:04:56.060> the<00:04:56.150> cage<00:04:56.300> behind<00:04:56.689> us
