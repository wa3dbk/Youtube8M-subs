Uptown

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
Uptown

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.800 
Uptown
not<00:02:45.470> make<00:02:45.860> so<00:02:46.250> just<00:02:46.640> going<00:02:46.790> to<00:02:46.879> have<00:02:47.060> that<00:02:47.090> to

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
not make so just going to have that to

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.710 
not make so just going to have that to
that<00:02:48.620> and<00:02:48.920> I'll<00:02:49.040> say<00:02:49.340> roughly<00:02:50.090> this<00:02:50.360> is<00:02:50.510> like<00:02:50.690> a

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
that and I'll say roughly this is like a

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.699 
that and I'll say roughly this is like a
tablespoon

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
tablespoon

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.309 
tablespoon
so<00:02:52.040> one<00:02:52.280> tablespoon<00:02:52.879> of<00:02:52.910> that<00:02:53.060> would<00:02:53.870> just<00:02:54.140> be

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
so one tablespoon of that would just be

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.770 
so one tablespoon of that would just be
perfect<00:02:54.950> if<00:02:55.160> you<00:02:55.280> thought<00:02:55.489> of<00:02:55.550> wondering<00:02:56.180> what

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
perfect if you thought of wondering what

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.530 
perfect if you thought of wondering what
is<00:02:56.989> the<00:02:57.170> measurement<00:02:57.530> you<00:02:58.069> want<00:02:58.340> to<00:02:58.519> use<00:02:58.760> say<00:02:59.150> I

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
is the measurement you want to use say I

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.520 
is the measurement you want to use say I
want<00:03:00.140> to<00:03:00.200> continue<00:03:00.700> staring<00:03:01.700> to<00:03:02.330> pee<00:03:02.540> I'm
