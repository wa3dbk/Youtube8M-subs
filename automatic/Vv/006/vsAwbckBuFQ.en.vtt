today we know 35k unbeatable squad
builder<00:00:04.920> by<00:00:05.009> far<00:00:05.250> the<00:00:05.370> best<00:00:05.580> one<00:00:05.670> I've<00:00:05.850> built

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
builder by far the best one I've built

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.150 
builder by far the best one I've built
so<00:00:06.210> far<00:00:06.450> cause<00:00:06.720> being<00:00:06.960> unbeatable<00:00:07.560> that<00:00:07.980> does

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
so far cause being unbeatable that does

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.410 
so far cause being unbeatable that does
help<00:00:08.309> its<00:00:08.519> cause<00:00:08.700> of<00:00:08.730> course<00:00:09.030> so<00:00:09.150> let's<00:00:09.300> get

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
help its cause of course so let's get

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.820 
help its cause of course so let's get

quite<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.199> good<00:01:01.260> player<00:01:01.559> this<00:01:01.680> year<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.280> last

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
quite a good player this year and last

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.030 
quite a good player this year and last
year<00:01:02.699> was<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.239> little<00:01:04.199> bit<00:01:04.320> faster<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.680> think<00:01:04.890> you

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
year was a little bit faster I think you

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.890 
year was a little bit faster I think you
had<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.189> five<00:01:05.580> page<00:01:05.790> but<00:01:06.030> still<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.420> think<00:01:06.659> he's

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
had a five page but still I think he's

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.320 
had a five page but still I think he's
at<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.049> upgrade<00:01:07.380> in<00:01:07.770> defending<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.400> dribbling

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.960 
park and yeah for any like a thousand
coins<00:01:13.590> he<00:01:13.799> does<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:13.979> very<00:01:14.070> good<00:01:14.250> job<00:01:14.400> in<00:01:14.760> this

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
coins he does a very good job in this

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.490 
coins he does a very good job in this
team<00:01:15.240> next<00:01:15.720> up<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.020> left<00:01:16.200> back<00:01:16.350> position

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:21.950 
leaves one and that is dig nay air and
just<00:01:21.030> need<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.270> quickly<00:01:21.450> change<00:01:21.780> the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
just need to quickly change the

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.630 
just need to quickly change the
parameters<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.439> course<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.490> one

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
parameters of course and that is one

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.039 
parameters of course and that is one
thing<00:01:23.820> but<00:01:23.939> having<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.330> club<00:01:24.600> full<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.840> players

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
thing but having a club full of players

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.570 
thing but having a club full of players
it<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.380> kind<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.680> difficult<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:26.040> find<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.400> play

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
it is kind of difficult to find the play

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.490 
it is kind of difficult to find the play

done<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:37.049> left<00:01:37.200> hand<00:01:37.439> side<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:37.680> think<00:01:37.920> he's

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
done that left hand side I think he's

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.950

got high medium work rate said don't

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.840 
got high medium work rate said don't
think<00:01:40.170> he<00:01:40.259> can<00:01:40.470> use<00:01:41.009> anyone<00:01:41.369> else<00:01:41.549> because<00:01:41.670> he

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
think he can use anyone else because he

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.520 
think he can use anyone else because he
is<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:42.060> course<00:01:42.210> for<00:01:42.450> chemistry<00:01:42.899> reasons<00:01:43.259> and

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
is of course for chemistry reasons and

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.710 
is of course for chemistry reasons and
yeah<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.490> did<00:01:44.670> do<00:01:44.820> some<00:01:45.060> job<00:01:45.210> nothing<00:01:45.450> wrong
