different modes you have to achieve each

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.279 
different modes you have to achieve each
one<00:00:22.920> so<00:00:23.430> this<00:00:23.640> one<00:00:23.760> you<00:00:23.789> can<00:00:23.970> see<00:00:24.090> I've<00:00:24.180> done

one so this one you can see I've done

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.550 
one so this one you can see I've done
quite<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.320> bit<00:00:25.410> at<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.740> game<00:00:25.920> there's<00:00:26.520> a<00:00:27.560> fly

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
quite a bit at the game there's a fly

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.140 
quite a bit at the game there's a fly
I've<00:00:28.770> done<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:28.980> little<00:00:29.130> bit<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.400> -<00:00:29.640> there's<00:00:30.000> I've

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
I've done a little bit of - there's I've

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.609 
I've done a little bit of - there's I've
gotten<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.449> little<00:00:30.539> bit<00:00:30.720> less<00:00:30.930> progress<00:00:31.440> in

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
gotten a little bit less progress in

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.819 
gotten a little bit less progress in
there<00:00:31.770> so<00:00:32.009> no<00:00:32.129> just<00:00:32.460> jump<00:00:32.640> in<00:00:32.759> dough<00:00:33.710> will<00:00:34.710> just

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
there so no just jump in dough will just

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.299 
there so no just jump in dough will just
jump<00:00:34.980> into<00:00:35.100> one<00:00:35.249> of<00:00:35.339> the<00:00:35.399> levels<00:00:35.699> here<00:00:35.850> one<00:00:36.390> one

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
jump into one of the levels here one one

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:39.739 
jump into one of the levels here one one
so<00:00:38.309> where<00:00:38.399> this<00:00:38.519> goes<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:39.059> need<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.539> collect

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:39.749 
so where this goes you need to collect

00:00:39.749 --> 00:00:41.180 
so where this goes you need to collect
every<00:00:40.350> single<00:00:40.379> one<00:00:40.679> of<00:00:40.739> these<00:00:40.890> little

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
every single one of these little

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.779 
every single one of these little
sunshine<00:00:41.969> things<00:00:42.359> wall<00:00:43.109> jump<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.739> run<00:00:43.979> so<00:00:44.640> in

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
sunshine things wall jump and run so in

sunshine things wall jump and run so in
this<00:00:44.909> particular<00:00:45.120> set<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.659> levels<00:00:45.989> all<00:00:46.139> you

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
this particular set of levels all you

this particular set of levels all you
can<00:00:46.620> do<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:46.889> jump

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
can do is jump

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.680 
can do is jump
there's<00:00:47.460> no<00:00:47.609> flying<00:00:47.909> there's<00:00:48.269> no<00:00:48.449> wall

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.020 
there's no flying there's no wall
running<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.350> just<00:00:49.379> jumping<00:00:50.069> around<00:00:50.280> trying

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030

to collect all of the different little

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.729 
to collect all of the different little
coin<00:00:53.639> things<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.809> little<00:00:55.079> coin<00:00:55.289> things<00:00:55.559> are

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
coin things the little coin things are

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.619 
coin things the little coin things are
worth<00:00:55.920> one<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.549> the<00:00:56.819> big<00:00:56.999> ones<00:00:57.210> oh<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.479> just

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
worth one and the big ones oh I just

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.469 
worth one and the big ones oh I just
missed<00:00:57.899> one<00:00:58.139> you<00:00:58.920> can<00:00:59.069> see<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.879> big<00:01:00.059> ones<00:01:00.299> when

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:00.479 
missed one you can see the big ones when

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:01.910 
missed one you can see the big ones when
they<00:01:00.600> explode<00:01:00.989> they're<00:01:01.260> worth<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.530> whole<00:01:01.649> bunch

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
they explode they're worth a whole bunch

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.009 
they explode they're worth a whole bunch
so<00:01:02.249> you<00:01:02.940> really<00:01:03.239> don't<00:01:03.389> want<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.539> miss<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.870> big

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
so you really don't want to miss the big

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.620 
so you really don't want to miss the big
coins<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.619> idea<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.339> collect<00:01:05.820> all<00:01:06.180> of

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
coins and the idea is to collect all of

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.870 
coins and the idea is to collect all of
the<00:01:06.750> coins<00:01:06.930> in<00:01:07.259> a<00:01:07.350> specific<00:01:07.619> level<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.340> you'll

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
the coins in a specific level and you'll

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.789 
the coins in a specific level and you'll
get<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.180> maximum<00:01:09.689> reward<00:01:10.049> for<00:01:10.200> doing<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.619> so

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
get the maximum reward for doing it so

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.850 
get the maximum reward for doing it so
this<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.219> end<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.430> level<00:01:11.670> right<00:01:11.820> there<00:01:11.850> and

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
this is the end of level right there and

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.069 
this is the end of level right there and
I<00:01:13.860> missed<00:01:14.100> one<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:14.549> it'll<00:01:14.700> tally<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:15.090> up<00:01:15.180> you

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:16.079 
I missed one so it'll tally it up you

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:18.319 
I missed one so it'll tally it up you
can<00:01:16.229> see<00:01:16.409> I<00:01:16.439> I<00:01:16.890> think<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.729> blue<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.149> green

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:18.329 
can see I I think the blue and the green

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:20.060 
can see I I think the blue and the green
gems<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.810> just<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.020> percentage<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.770> get<00:01:20.039> a

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
gems is just a percentage and you get a

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.749 
gems is just a percentage and you get a
red<00:01:20.340> gem<00:01:20.579> at<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.789> end<00:01:20.969> if<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.210> get<00:01:21.329> 100%<00:01:22.759> so

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
red gem at the end if you get 100% so

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.260 
red gem at the end if you get 100% so
here's<00:01:23.939> level<00:01:24.119> 1<00:01:24.509> -<00:01:24.899> and<00:01:25.289> in<00:01:25.469> this<00:01:25.590> one<00:01:26.270> I'll

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
here's level 1 - and in this one I'll

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.100 
here's level 1 - and in this one I'll
try<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.479> get<00:01:27.630> all<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.960> coins

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.840 

so<00:01:33.110> the<00:01:33.230> idea<00:01:33.530> in<00:01:33.620> the<00:01:33.710> game<00:01:33.860> is<00:01:34.070> that<00:01:34.250> he's

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
so the idea in the game is that he's

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.030 
so the idea in the game is that he's
always<00:01:35.180> running<00:01:35.540> forward<00:01:36.110> you<00:01:36.350> don't<00:01:36.530> control

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
always running forward you don't control

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.580 
always running forward you don't control
whether<00:01:37.400> he<00:01:37.730> runs<00:01:38.060> or<00:01:38.540> stops<00:01:38.960> or<00:01:39.230> whatnot<00:01:39.410> you

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
whether he runs or stops or whatnot you

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.580 
whether he runs or stops or whatnot you
only<00:01:40.130> control<00:01:40.640> his<00:01:40.850> action<00:01:41.330> of<00:01:41.480> in<00:01:41.690> this<00:01:41.930> case

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
only control his action of in this case

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.700 
only control his action of in this case
jumping<00:01:43.690> and<00:01:44.690> the<00:01:44.780> idea<00:01:45.020> is<00:01:45.080> to<00:01:45.170> collect<00:01:45.500> all

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
jumping and the idea is to collect all

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.620 
jumping and the idea is to collect all
the<00:01:45.830> points<00:01:46.190> there<00:01:46.790> we<00:01:46.880> go<00:01:46.970> so<00:01:47.180> this<00:01:47.300> one<00:01:47.420> I<00:01:47.450> got

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
the points there we go so this one I got

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.930 
the points there we go so this one I got
all<00:01:47.780> the<00:01:47.900> coins<00:01:48.080> in<00:01:48.290> and<00:01:48.440> you<00:01:48.500> can<00:01:48.620> see<00:01:48.830> as<00:01:49.340> I<00:01:49.910> go

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
all the coins in and you can see as I go

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.310 
all the coins in and you can see as I go
here<00:01:50.120> I<00:01:51.400> get<00:01:52.400> the<00:01:52.520> red<00:01:52.670> gem<00:01:52.910> at<00:01:53.030> the<00:01:53.120> end<00:01:53.320> so

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
here I get the red gem at the end so

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.870 
here I get the red gem at the end so
when<00:01:54.440> you<00:01:54.560> get<00:01:54.680> that<00:01:54.860> for<00:01:55.130> those<00:01:55.250> perfect<00:01:55.490> red

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
when you get that for those perfect red

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.790 
when you get that for those perfect red
gems<00:01:56.210> they<00:01:56.510> tally<00:01:56.810> up<00:01:57.050> and<00:01:57.260> if<00:01:57.320> you<00:01:57.440> can<00:01:57.620> get

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
gems they tally up and if you can get

unlocks this bonus round at the end you
can<00:02:03.830> see<00:02:03.979> here<00:02:04.190> I've<00:02:04.310> got<00:02:04.550> zero<00:02:05.030> out<00:02:05.090> of<00:02:05.270> five<00:02:05.450> I

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
can see here I've got zero out of five I

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:06.850 
can see here I've got zero out of five I
kind<00:02:06.200> of<00:02:06.229> look<00:02:06.350> through<00:02:06.500> that<00:02:06.590> pretty<00:02:06.800> quickly

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
kind of look through that pretty quickly

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.260 
kind of look through that pretty quickly
but<00:02:07.720> and<00:02:08.720> it<00:02:08.840> here<00:02:09.020> we<00:02:09.140> can<00:02:09.170> fly<00:02:09.850> so<00:02:10.850> a<00:02:10.880> new

but and it here we can fly so a new

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.540 
but and it here we can fly so a new
mechanic<00:02:11.600> is<00:02:11.870> added<00:02:12.200> each<00:02:12.950> additional<00:02:13.610> world

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
mechanic is added each additional world

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.260 
mechanic is added each additional world
to<00:02:16.550> make<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:16.760> game<00:02:16.880> a<00:02:16.910> little<00:02:17.090> more

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
to make the game a little more

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.570 
to make the game a little more
interesting<00:02:17.390> and<00:02:18.290> what<00:02:19.130> I've<00:02:19.220> noticed<00:02:19.370> what

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
interesting and what I've noticed what

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.940 
interesting and what I've noticed what
this<00:02:19.670> game<00:02:19.880> is<00:02:20.090> is<00:02:20.330> everything<00:02:21.200> all<00:02:21.680> of<00:02:21.830> the

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
this game is is everything all of the

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.090 
this game is is everything all of the
basics<00:02:22.459> are<00:02:22.880> just<00:02:23.450> really<00:02:23.840> done<00:02:24.320> well<00:02:24.680> like

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
basics are just really done well like

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.130 
basics are just really done well like
the<00:02:25.280> animation<00:02:25.730> is<00:02:26.060> really<00:02:26.090> good<00:02:26.690> the

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
the animation is really good the

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.260 
the animation is really good the
graphics<00:02:27.680> are<00:02:27.830> really<00:02:27.860> good<00:02:28.220> I<00:02:28.489> really<00:02:28.670> enjoy

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
graphics are really good I really enjoy

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.800 
graphics are really good I really enjoy
the<00:02:29.420> music<00:02:29.870> the<00:02:30.110> gameplay<00:02:30.680> although

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
the music the gameplay although

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.810 
the music the gameplay although
relatively<00:02:32.810> simplistic<00:02:33.400> it's<00:02:34.400> still<00:02:34.670> really

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
relatively simplistic it's still really

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.390 
relatively simplistic it's still really
good<00:02:35.000> gameplay<00:02:35.500> I've<00:02:36.500> gone<00:02:36.709> through<00:02:36.769> many<00:02:37.280> of

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
good gameplay I've gone through many of

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.009 
good gameplay I've gone through many of
these<00:02:37.489> levels<00:02:37.820> over<00:02:38.150> and<00:02:38.269> over<00:02:38.450> again<00:02:38.570> and<00:02:38.900> I

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
these levels over and over again and I

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.660 
these levels over and over again and I
really<00:02:39.290> don't<00:02:39.410> find<00:02:39.650> them<00:02:39.799> that<00:02:39.920> boring<00:02:40.400> so

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
really don't find them that boring so

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:41.920 
really don't find them that boring so
I'm<00:02:40.910> having<00:02:41.030> a<00:02:41.180> really<00:02:41.360> good<00:02:41.480> time<00:02:41.540> with<00:02:41.810> the

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
I'm having a really good time with the

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.440 
I'm having a really good time with the
game<00:02:42.080> cost<00:02:42.590> $3<00:02:43.250> and<00:02:43.489> I<00:02:43.940> really<00:02:44.180> think<00:02:44.299> the

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
game cost $3 and I really think the

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.030 
game cost $3 and I really think the
price<00:02:44.660> is<00:02:44.690> actually<00:02:45.110> worth<00:02:45.590> it<00:02:45.799> in<00:02:45.950> the

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
price is actually worth it in the

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.530 
price is actually worth it in the
beginning<00:02:46.430> I<00:02:46.519> was<00:02:46.610> kind<00:02:46.670> of<00:02:46.850> like<00:02:46.970> I<00:02:47.120> don't

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
beginning I was kind of like I don't

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.520 
beginning I was kind of like I don't
know<00:02:47.600> if<00:02:47.660> it's<00:02:47.750> really<00:02:47.930> worth<00:02:48.049> three<00:02:48.320> bucks

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
know if it's really worth three bucks

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.009 
know if it's really worth three bucks
considering<00:02:49.160> all<00:02:49.820> you<00:02:49.910> really<00:02:50.060> do<00:02:50.299> is<00:02:50.330> run

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
considering all you really do is run

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.710 
considering all you really do is run
jump<00:02:51.590> or<00:02:51.830> in<00:02:52.310> this<00:02:52.400> case<00:02:52.610> wall<00:02:52.940> jump<00:02:53.180> or<00:02:53.360> wall

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
jump or in this case wall jump or wall

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.900 
jump or in this case wall jump or wall
rot<00:02:53.959> and<00:02:54.080> I<00:02:54.170> should<00:02:54.350> say<00:02:54.560> so<00:02:55.549> here<00:02:55.700> you<00:02:55.790> can

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
rot and I should say so here you can

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.410 
rot and I should say so here you can
what<00:02:56.150> jump<00:02:56.390> on<00:02:56.540> run<00:02:57.049> on<00:02:57.170> walls<00:02:57.350> and<00:02:58.180> it<00:02:59.180> bounced

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
what jump on run on walls and it bounced

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.870 
what jump on run on walls and it bounced
around

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.720 

and<00:03:02.140> so<00:03:03.140> the<00:03:03.230> game<00:03:03.380> is<00:03:03.530> more<00:03:03.650> complex<00:03:04.160> but<00:03:04.370> it

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
and so the game is more complex but it

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.760 
and so the game is more complex but it
really<00:03:05.030> it's<00:03:05.450> a<00:03:05.600> really<00:03:05.900> tight<00:03:06.170> game<00:03:06.500> it

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
really it's a really tight game it

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.310 
really it's a really tight game it
actually<00:03:07.250> for<00:03:08.060> three<00:03:08.390> bucks<00:03:08.630> it<00:03:08.930> actually

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
actually for three bucks it actually

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.460 
actually for three bucks it actually
feels<00:03:09.680> like<00:03:10.010> a<00:03:10.160> pretty<00:03:10.520> decent<00:03:11.090> game<00:03:11.300> I<00:03:11.630> can

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
feels like a pretty decent game I can

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.230 
feels like a pretty decent game I can
see<00:03:12.680> there's<00:03:12.890> probably<00:03:13.280> a<00:03:13.340> limited<00:03:13.910> amount<00:03:14.150> of

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
see there's probably a limited amount of

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.820 
see there's probably a limited amount of
Appeal<00:03:14.540> here<00:03:14.780> with<00:03:15.080> the<00:03:15.260> four<00:03:15.470> different

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
Appeal here with the four different

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.310 
Appeal here with the four different
worlds<00:03:16.220> if<00:03:17.090> you're<00:03:17.420> just<00:03:17.750> gonna<00:03:18.020> run<00:03:18.290> through

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
worlds if you're just gonna run through

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.830 
worlds if you're just gonna run through
the<00:03:18.530> game<00:03:18.710> and<00:03:18.950> not<00:03:19.460> get<00:03:19.820> all<00:03:20.060> the<00:03:20.330> coins<00:03:20.540> and

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
the game and not get all the coins and

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.270 
the game and not get all the coins and
try<00:03:20.960> to<00:03:21.020> beat<00:03:21.230> all<00:03:21.380> the<00:03:21.530> levels<00:03:21.560> you're

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
try to beat all the levels you're

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.740 
try to beat all the levels you're
probably<00:03:22.520> gonna<00:03:22.850> have<00:03:23.000> a<00:03:23.060> limited<00:03:23.510> amount<00:03:23.600> of

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
probably gonna have a limited amount of

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.510 
probably gonna have a limited amount of
time<00:03:23.840> before<00:03:24.230> you<00:03:24.530> run<00:03:24.950> out<00:03:25.040> of<00:03:25.100> things<00:03:25.280> to<00:03:25.430> do

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
time before you run out of things to do

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.520 
time before you run out of things to do
if<00:03:26.240> you're<00:03:26.360> trying<00:03:26.570> to<00:03:26.690> get<00:03:26.810> perfect<00:03:27.290> on<00:03:27.380> every

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
if you're trying to get perfect on every

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.230 
if you're trying to get perfect on every
single<00:03:27.800> level<00:03:28.010> I<00:03:28.310> could<00:03:28.520> imagine<00:03:28.820> that<00:03:29.060> you're

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.240 
single level I could imagine that you're

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.380 
single level I could imagine that you're
actually<00:03:29.330> gonna<00:03:29.600> take<00:03:29.840> quite<00:03:30.590> a<00:03:30.650> bit<00:03:30.860> of<00:03:30.950> time

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
actually gonna take quite a bit of time

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.020 
actually gonna take quite a bit of time
almost<00:03:32.390> miss<00:03:32.510> that<00:03:32.690> one<00:03:33.550> to<00:03:34.550> actually<00:03:34.820> clear

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
almost miss that one to actually clear

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.250 
almost miss that one to actually clear
it<00:03:35.090> out<00:03:35.150> and<00:03:35.360> do<00:03:35.450> it<00:03:35.570> properly

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
it out and do it properly

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.110 
it out and do it properly
right<00:03:36.440> and<00:03:36.710> so<00:03:36.890> I<00:03:36.920> think<00:03:37.100> I'll<00:03:37.430> probably<00:03:37.640> go

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
right and so I think I'll probably go

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.410 
right and so I think I'll probably go
through<00:03:38.390> and<00:03:38.780> get<00:03:39.680> all<00:03:39.890> those<00:03:40.220> 100%<00:03:41.030> markers<00:03:41.360> I

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
through and get all those 100% markers I

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.760 
through and get all those 100% markers I
might<00:03:41.570> even<00:03:41.750> do<00:03:41.900> some<00:03:42.050> walkthroughs<00:03:42.500> on<00:03:42.650> this

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
might even do some walkthroughs on this

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.380 
might even do some walkthroughs on this
game<00:03:42.950> because<00:03:43.460> I'm<00:03:43.580> really<00:03:43.730> enjoying<00:03:43.910> playing

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
game because I'm really enjoying playing

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.510 
game because I'm really enjoying playing
it<00:03:44.540> it's<00:03:44.750> a<00:03:44.810> pretty<00:03:45.020> fun<00:03:45.230> game<00:03:45.260> I<00:03:45.680> mean<00:03:45.860> it<00:03:46.010> the

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
it it's a pretty fun game I mean it the

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.570 
it it's a pretty fun game I mean it the
sound<00:03:47.480> really<00:03:47.960> gets<00:03:48.140> it<00:03:48.320> so<00:03:49.190> here<00:03:49.310> let's<00:03:49.460> take

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
sound really gets it so here let's take

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:50.920 
sound really gets it so here let's take
a<00:03:49.610> look<00:03:49.790> at<00:03:49.910> that<00:03:50.030> bonus<00:03:50.420> level<00:03:50.690> so<00:03:50.810> these

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
a look at that bonus level so these

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.980 
a look at that bonus level so these
bonus<00:03:51.320> levels<00:03:51.650> there<00:03:52.130> are<00:03:52.370> no<00:03:52.730> coins<00:03:53.120> in<00:03:53.390> the

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:53.990 
bonus levels there are no coins in the

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.550 
bonus levels there are no coins in the
idea<00:03:54.440> is<00:03:54.620> just<00:03:54.650> to<00:03:55.190> survive<00:03:56.470> and<00:03:57.470> I've

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
idea is just to survive and I've

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.320 
idea is just to survive and I've
actually<00:03:57.740> edited<00:03:58.250> this<00:03:58.370> footage<00:03:58.730> so<00:03:58.970> you're

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
actually edited this footage so you're

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.230 
actually edited this footage so you're
gonna<00:03:59.420> see<00:03:59.660> me<00:03:59.780> beat<00:04:00.080> this<00:04:00.260> level<00:04:00.650> but<00:04:01.030> this<00:04:02.030> is

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.240 
gonna see me beat this level but this is

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.720 
gonna see me beat this level but this is
not<00:04:02.390> an<00:04:02.570> easy<00:04:02.750> level<00:04:03.050> to<00:04:03.380> beat<00:04:03.590> you'll<00:04:04.370> die<00:04:04.670> the

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
not an easy level to beat you'll die the

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.070 
not an easy level to beat you'll die the
first<00:04:05.210> time<00:04:05.330> you<00:04:05.390> play<00:04:05.540> this<00:04:05.720> you'll<00:04:05.900> probably

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
first time you play this you'll probably

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.290 
first time you play this you'll probably
die<00:04:06.500> a<00:04:06.530> good<00:04:06.800> 20<00:04:07.190> or<00:04:07.280> 30<00:04:07.550> times<00:04:07.820> before<00:04:08.060> you're

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
die a good 20 or 30 times before you're

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.150 
die a good 20 or 30 times before you're
actually<00:04:08.480> able<00:04:08.780> to<00:04:08.870> clear<00:04:09.110> the<00:04:09.230> level<00:04:09.380> the

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
actually able to clear the level the

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.890 
actually able to clear the level the
reason<00:04:10.490> is<00:04:10.640> is<00:04:10.790> that<00:04:10.940> there<00:04:11.120> is<00:04:11.210> just<00:04:11.480> so<00:04:11.660> much

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
reason is is that there is just so much

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.230 
reason is is that there is just so much
hazard<00:04:12.560> in<00:04:12.650> this<00:04:12.770> level<00:04:12.980> and<00:04:13.280> so<00:04:13.490> many<00:04:13.670> jumps

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:14.240 
hazard in this level and so many jumps

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.310 
hazard in this level and so many jumps
that<00:04:14.330> need<00:04:14.450> to<00:04:14.510> be<00:04:14.600> memorized

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
that need to be memorized

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.190 
that need to be memorized
that<00:04:16.040> it's<00:04:17.030> gonna<00:04:17.210> catch<00:04:17.510> you<00:04:17.690> many<00:04:17.989> many

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
that it's gonna catch you many many

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.159 
that it's gonna catch you many many
times

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
times

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.080 
times
like<00:04:20.829> this<00:04:21.009> jump<00:04:21.280> right<00:04:21.400> here<00:04:21.459> you<00:04:21.789> have<00:04:21.819> to

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
like this jump right here you have to

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.149 
like this jump right here you have to
wait<00:04:22.270> for<00:04:22.539> it<00:04:22.569> and<00:04:23.139> go<00:04:23.469> backwards

00:04:24.149 --> 00:04:24.159 
wait for it and go backwards

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:25.830 
wait for it and go backwards
you<00:04:24.819> don't<00:04:24.969> realize<00:04:25.210> it<00:04:25.300> the<00:04:25.389> first<00:04:25.599> time<00:04:25.780> and

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
you don't realize it the first time and

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.360 
you don't realize it the first time and
you're<00:04:26.199> gonna<00:04:26.289> end<00:04:26.530> up<00:04:26.620> dying<00:04:26.860> there<00:04:27.069> two<00:04:27.249> or

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
you're gonna end up dying there two or

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.830 
you're gonna end up dying there two or
three<00:04:27.520> times<00:04:27.699> before<00:04:27.999> you<00:04:28.270> actually<00:04:28.599> finish

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
three times before you actually finish

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.140 
three times before you actually finish
it<00:04:28.870> the<00:04:29.770> ID<00:04:30.009> on<00:04:30.039> these<00:04:30.249> levels<00:04:30.580> is<00:04:30.759> is<00:04:30.999> that

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
it the ID on these levels is is that

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.879 
it the ID on these levels is is that
you're<00:04:31.270> trying<00:04:31.539> to<00:04:31.629> do<00:04:31.810> like<00:04:32.110> a<00:04:32.139> time<00:04:32.499> attack

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:32.889 
you're trying to do like a time attack

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:34.589 
you're trying to do like a time attack
or<00:04:33.129> a<00:04:33.159> time<00:04:33.490> time<00:04:33.999> score<00:04:34.270> you're<00:04:34.360> trying<00:04:34.509> to

00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:34.599 
or a time time score you're trying to

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:36.989 
or a time time score you're trying to
get<00:04:34.689> to<00:04:34.749> the<00:04:34.930> level<00:04:35.050> as<00:04:35.229> fast<00:04:35.439> as<00:04:35.620> possible<00:04:36.159> but

00:04:36.989 --> 00:04:36.999 
get to the level as fast as possible but

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:39.980 
get to the level as fast as possible but
it's<00:04:37.150> hard<00:04:37.330> just<00:04:37.749> surviving<00:04:38.439> in<00:04:38.529> these<00:04:38.650> levels

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
it's hard just surviving in these levels

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.860 
it's hard just surviving in these levels
nonetheless<00:04:40.990> they're<00:04:41.680> very<00:04:42.069> fun<00:04:42.840> whoa<00:04:43.840> I

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
nonetheless they're very fun whoa I

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.300 
nonetheless they're very fun whoa I
can't<00:04:44.349> believe<00:04:44.379> I<00:04:44.560> didn't<00:04:44.770> die<00:04:44.889> there

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
can't believe I didn't die there

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.439 
can't believe I didn't die there
that<00:04:45.460> looks<00:04:45.699> pretty<00:04:45.969> pretty<00:04:46.749> crazy<00:04:47.050> and<00:04:48.449> so

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:49.449 
that looks pretty pretty crazy and so

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:51.899 
that looks pretty pretty crazy and so
that's<00:04:49.870> it<00:04:50.169> 54<00:04:50.740> seconds<00:04:51.129> not<00:04:51.310> my<00:04:51.460> best<00:04:51.699> time<00:04:51.879> I

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:51.909 
that's it 54 seconds not my best time I

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:53.580 
that's it 54 seconds not my best time I
think<00:04:52.090> my<00:04:52.240> best<00:04:52.419> time<00:04:52.539> was<00:04:52.599> 53<00:04:53.110> seconds<00:04:53.409> but

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
think my best time was 53 seconds but

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:54.570 
think my best time was 53 seconds but
you<00:04:53.650> can<00:04:53.770> see<00:04:53.889> there's<00:04:54.069> a<00:04:54.129> lot<00:04:54.279> of<00:04:54.370> room<00:04:54.550> for

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
you can see there's a lot of room for

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.640 
you can see there's a lot of room for
improvement<00:04:54.789> on<00:04:55.270> that<00:04:55.330> run<00:04:55.659> I've<00:04:56.259> made<00:04:56.469> a<00:04:56.500> lot

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
improvement on that run I've made a lot

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.529 
improvement on that run I've made a lot
of<00:04:56.710> mistakes<00:04:56.860> there<00:04:57.340> that<00:04:57.550> could<00:04:57.729> optimize

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
of mistakes there that could optimize

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:01.890 
of mistakes there that could optimize
that<00:04:58.750> run<00:05:00.029> so<00:05:01.029> that's<00:05:01.180> the<00:05:01.300> game<00:05:01.479> there's<00:05:01.750> also

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
that run so that's the game there's also

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.689 
that run so that's the game there's also
punch<00:05:02.319> which<00:05:02.620> I<00:05:02.710> haven't<00:05:03.039> got<00:05:03.189> to<00:05:03.370> punch<00:05:03.550> yet

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:03.699 
punch which I haven't got to punch yet
