00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.150
 in these last days 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.350
 there is a lot of talk about production 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.680
 coconut 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:16.030
 but notice that I'm going to talk about 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.310
 coconut cultivation 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.740
 of production at this moment we talk 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.850
 of production through the cultivation of 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:27.580
 color because it 's an interesting business 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:31.119
 that is being carried out due to the 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.430
 needs that there are of the products that 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.910
 give the coconut 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:39.000
 and that a person who knows much 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.239
 doctor carlos loop talk about what are 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.300
 those alternatives that you have doing 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.130
 the cultivation of coconut because I had the 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.670
 opportunity to visit plants where 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:53.580
 process the coconut and how they are obtained 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.699
 different types of products whether 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.680
 detergent soaps projects for 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.040
 animal feed for food 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.530
 human for all social the coconut is 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.990
 take advantage of everything and it is interesting to see the 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.930
 possibilities that Paraguay has for 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.530
 that we have another alternative 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.960
 of farming that has much future 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.810
 the coconut tree in the mouth is already a plant 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.640
 oleaginous typical of Paraguay East 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.759
 cultivation represents an interesting 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.950
 option for the farmer when the coconut 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.950
 it is cultivated in a rational way and 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.270
 intentional you can get older 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.390
 Benefits 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.509
 and then we are seeing that the coconut 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.090
 cultivated yields more in terms of quality 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.729
 as for amount of fruits then 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.649
 is very different from the others as such 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.280
 and greens that exist in the country then 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.330
 a pretty performance is expected 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.970
 interesting also in the industries 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.429
 that are then of some costs and some 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.250
 yields that are profitable so that 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:58.440
 a coconut oil factory can 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.300
 work in Paraguay what we want 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.220
 then it is to encourage a little 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.990
 raise a little awareness of the peasant 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.240
 Paraguayan farmer who cultivates the coconut 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.700
 but no longer let nature 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.590
 is providing us but that they 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.959
 neither also in looking for nature 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.910
 taking advantage of the kindness that 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.560
 is giving nature in terms of 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.680
 should you be provided then this plant 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.790
 so generous so noble so useful for in 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.120
 the peasant family for 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:27.480
 go and for the country in general a total 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.689
 cultivated has an average density 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:34.319
 of 725 plants on one hectare instead 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:36.629
 1 wild has only 35 100 plants 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.700
 that gives us 30 boxes the cultivated of 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:41.099
 600 and 200 practicing drawers the 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.510
 productivity is 20 times higher than 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.799
 quality is also superior 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.319
 Factory performance is also 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:49.230
 superior the professional explains that the 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:51.719
 The caching practice does not generate any 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.780
 benefit for the production of coconut to 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:57.659
 house this is a coconut almost totally 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:01.230
 black true without shell without pericarp 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:03.810
 and the pulp is so deserved the oil that 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.409
 the stone to be then totally 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.790
 without having developed 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:10.560
 conveniently and the almond that 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.389
 will have inside will also be like this and with 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.760
 an oil also made him high and color 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:20.459
 High frisked is a practice 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.200
 disseminated and took root strongly in the 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.049
 Paraguayan farmer that consists of 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.330
 take off with a knife 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:29.520
 sharp the settler of aquara 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.230
 a bit that something that has barely 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:35.370
 started to mature and has not developed 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:38.220
 completely its components then 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.650
 when a farmer has 30 or 100 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.230
 plants in a story it's easy to go to 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.630
 hunt instead if you have cultivated 600 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.700
 plants he will not have time to 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.020
 go to cache his coconut because he's going to 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.690
 pick up the ripe coconut that fell on the 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.550
 clean soil and like when he got there 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.440
 extreme already has other bases the 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.750
 next round which the other coconuts 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.360
 that have also fallen naturally 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.310
 that the peasant will not seek to punish 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.040
 not the business the peasant there is 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.630
 have then the coconut mature completely 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.459
 full then it's easier to fill 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.709
 more quantity of drawers to be delivered to 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:13.410
 market and have your income on 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.480
 silver finally the doctor states that 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.180
 this item has an important potential 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.700
 to generate the opening of new 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.860
 markets but you must work for 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.170
 get bigger volume and better 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.640
 quality of the fruits and when there 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.530
 enough of enough 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.820
 quality of coconut fruit we will have 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.020
 then quality also in terms of 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.639
 oil is going to have 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.289
 volume to offer to the market 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.750
 international then the business is 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:38.490
 makes attractive while we are 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.470
 offering the normal small amount 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.569
 that we have today and with the quality that 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.180
 we have today it is very difficult to get 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:46.889
 markets and not only get to keep 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.750
 markets are also made more 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:50.190
 difficult is not so much the problem is not 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.569
 so much to achieve but to conserve those 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.580
 markets when we have 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:57.150
 quantity we have volume we have quality 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:59.039
 then the international buyer will see 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:02.400
 have a tranquility that is going to have 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:04.289
 volume you need in your industry in 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.639
 that country and will also have the 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:07.770
 tranquility have the quality that 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:09.389
 you need the center because in that country 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.250
 then we will win also 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:15.259
 tranquility in the client then 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.259
 we have assured that customer also
