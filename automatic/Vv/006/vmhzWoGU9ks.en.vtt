00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.060 
I was telling you about to go over top
more<00:03:49.080> storage<00:03:49.500> inside<00:03:49.980> the<00:03:50.130> unit<00:03:51.950> reason<00:03:52.950> why

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
more storage inside the unit reason why

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.190 
more storage inside the unit reason why
I'm<00:03:53.190> showing<00:03:53.580> you<00:03:53.610> all<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.330> storage<00:03:54.660> inside

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
here is because most of these units just

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.950 
here is because most of these units just
don't<00:03:57.990> have<00:03:58.290> it<00:03:59.240> there's<00:04:00.240> a<00:04:00.330> storage

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:00.960 
don't have it there's a storage

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:06.020 
don't have it there's a storage
everywhere<00:04:01.620> around<00:04:01.770> here<00:04:04.520> the<00:04:05.520> first<00:04:05.730> thing<00:04:05.910> I

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
everywhere around here the first thing I

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.120 
everywhere around here the first thing I
look<00:04:07.020> for<00:04:07.050> whenever<00:04:07.470> we<00:04:07.710> get<00:04:07.860> something
