have to be stat through flash because

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.240 
have to be stat through flash because
that's<00:01:08.440> all<00:01:08.680> that<00:01:09.130> kt<00:01:09.430> rolster<00:01:09.700> has<00:01:10.150> left<00:01:10.540> uh

that's all that kt rolster has left uh

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.980 
that's all that kt rolster has left uh
losing<00:01:12.250> twice<00:01:12.520> these<00:01:13.240> are<00:01:13.390> the<00:01:13.479> best<00:01:13.720> players

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
losing twice these are the best players

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.500

they<00:01:14.229> have<00:01:14.440> left<00:01:14.710> stats<00:01:15.520> and<00:01:15.820> flash<00:01:16.210> and<00:01:16.450> they

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:16.510 
they have left stats and flash and they

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.300 
they have left stats and flash and they
sent<00:01:16.750> stats<00:01:17.080> on<00:01:17.290> this<00:01:17.440> map<00:01:17.590> I<00:01:17.740> think<00:01:18.010> because

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
sent stats on this map I think because

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.460 
sent stats on this map I think because
this<00:01:18.610> is<00:01:18.729> Icarus<00:01:19.090> it's<00:01:19.840> pretty<00:01:20.080> favored

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
this is Icarus it's pretty favored

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.450 
this is Icarus it's pretty favored
towards<00:01:20.830> zerg<00:01:21.250> and<00:01:21.780> zbt<00:01:22.780> and<00:01:23.110> plus<00:01:23.799> flash<00:01:24.220> has

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.070 
towards zerg and zbt and plus flash has
had<00:01:24.580> troubles<00:01:24.970> on<00:01:25.150> this<00:01:25.299> map<00:01:25.510> before<00:01:25.750> I'm

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
had troubles on this map before I'm

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.289 
had troubles on this map before I'm
remembering<00:01:26.439> back<00:01:26.650> to<00:01:26.770> the<00:01:26.890> OSL<00:01:27.310> I<00:01:27.549> forget<00:01:28.180> who

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:28.299 
remembering back to the OSL I forget who

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:30.899 
remembering back to the OSL I forget who
he<00:01:28.450> faced<00:01:28.750> with<00:01:28.930> it<00:01:29.080> hook<00:01:29.460> not<00:01:30.460> exactly<00:01:30.790> sure

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
he faced with it hook not exactly sure

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.020 
he faced with it hook not exactly sure
but<00:01:31.799> whoever<00:01:32.799> he<00:01:33.130> faced<00:01:33.369> he<00:01:33.520> built<00:01:33.729> way<00:01:33.970> too

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
but whoever he faced he built way too

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.660 
but whoever he faced he built way too
many<00:01:34.689> turrets<00:01:35.310> overcommitted<00:01:36.310> two<00:01:36.490> turrets

many turrets overcommitted two turrets

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.580 
many turrets overcommitted two turrets
and<00:01:37.180> he<00:01:37.420> just<00:01:37.570> couldn't<00:01:37.840> seem<00:01:38.110> to<00:01:38.140> figure<00:01:38.380> this

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
and he just couldn't seem to figure this

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.620 
and he just couldn't seem to figure this
map<00:01:38.830> out<00:01:39.070> every<00:01:39.880> once<00:01:39.970> in<00:01:40.150> a<00:01:40.210> while<00:01:40.330> a<00:01:40.360> map

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
map out every once in a while a map

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.899 
map out every once in a while a map
comes<00:01:40.900> around<00:01:41.200> around<00:01:41.650> like<00:01:41.920> that<00:01:42.159> usually<00:01:42.430> a

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
comes around around like that usually a

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.480 
comes around around like that usually a
favorite<00:01:43.540> against<00:01:43.990> terran<00:01:44.500> that<00:01:44.979> flash<00:01:45.250> just

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
favorite against terran that flash just

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.330 
favorite against terran that flash just
can't<00:01:45.820> seem<00:01:46.090> to<00:01:46.119> get<00:01:46.450> his<00:01:46.630> mind<00:01:47.470> around<00:01:47.920> and<00:01:48.189> I

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
can't seem to get his mind around and I

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.039 
can't seem to get his mind around and I
think<00:01:48.610> match<00:01:48.729> point<00:01:49.060> is<00:01:49.210> another<00:01:49.450> example<00:01:49.630> of

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
think match point is another example of

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:51.870 
think match point is another example of
that<00:01:50.140> he<00:01:50.590> can<00:01:50.740> never<00:01:50.860> seem<00:01:51.100> to<00:01:51.220> quite<00:01:51.369> figure

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
that he can never seem to quite figure

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.120 
that he can never seem to quite figure
out<00:01:51.909> match<00:01:52.299> point<00:01:52.659> he<00:01:53.170> won<00:01:53.439> some<00:01:53.650> games<00:01:53.829> on<00:01:54.009> it

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
out match point he won some games on it

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.399 
out match point he won some games on it
obviously<00:01:54.220> but<00:01:54.759> couldn't<00:01:55.659> quite<00:01:55.930> figure<00:01:56.200> that

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
obviously but couldn't quite figure that

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.760 
obviously but couldn't quite figure that
map<00:01:56.619> out<00:01:56.829> his<00:01:57.549> terminator<00:01:58.119> of<00:01:58.479> math<00:01:59.320> skills

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
map out his terminator of math skills

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.429 
map out his terminator of math skills
just<00:01:59.950> couldn't<00:02:00.250> click<00:02:00.520> in<00:02:00.700> there<00:02:00.909> i<00:02:00.939> guess<00:02:01.439> my

own<00:03:30.709> Protoss<00:03:31.340> is<00:03:31.549> so<00:03:31.729> hard<00:03:32.260> and<00:03:33.260> I<00:03:34.190> could

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
own Protoss is so hard and I could

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.219 
own Protoss is so hard and I could
really<00:03:34.489> recall<00:03:35.209> any<00:03:35.510> games<00:03:35.780> were<00:03:35.930> asked<00:03:36.079> to

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:36.229 
really recall any games were asked to

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:37.899 
really recall any games were asked to
had<00:03:36.349> done<00:03:36.500> the<00:03:36.590> same<00:03:36.769> thing<00:03:36.829> but<00:03:37.099> obviously<00:03:37.639> as

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:37.909 
had done the same thing but obviously as

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:40.449 
had done the same thing but obviously as
two<00:03:38.260> very<00:03:39.260> good<00:03:39.319> he<00:03:39.620> owned<00:03:39.829> perfect<00:03:40.340> man

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
two very good he owned perfect man

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.119 
two very good he owned perfect man
pretty<00:03:40.760> hard<00:03:41.000> so<00:03:41.720> I<00:03:41.780> think<00:03:41.900> he<00:03:42.169> he<00:03:42.829> does<00:03:42.979> have

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:43.129 
pretty hard so I think he he does have

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:45.189 
pretty hard so I think he he does have
what<00:03:43.310> it<00:03:43.400> takes<00:03:43.609> to<00:03:43.699> take<00:03:43.970> down<00:03:44.180> stats<00:03:44.870> but<00:03:45.079> it

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:45.199 
what it takes to take down stats but it

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:47.199 
what it takes to take down stats but it
will<00:03:45.319> be<00:03:45.349> extremely<00:03:45.799> difficult<00:03:46.729> because

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
will be extremely difficult because

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.750 
will be extremely difficult because
that's<00:03:47.629> is<00:03:47.930> there<00:03:48.680> as<00:03:48.859> I<00:03:49.099> said<00:03:49.159> kt<00:03:49.519> rolster

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
that's is there as I said kt rolster

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
alright let's check this but the

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:30.700 
alright let's check this but the
observers<00:04:29.990> are<00:04:30.080> pointing<00:04:30.320> out<00:04:30.410> that<00:04:30.590> I

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
observers are pointing out that I

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.800 
observers are pointing out that I
there's<00:04:31.220> no<00:04:31.280> layer<00:04:31.850> at<00:04:32.090> all<00:04:32.270> i<00:04:32.300> thought<00:04:32.570> i<00:04:32.630> saw

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
there's no layer at all i thought i saw

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.170 
there's no layer at all i thought i saw
the<00:04:32.870> layer<00:04:33.110> morphing<00:04:33.590> earlier<00:04:33.920> actually<00:04:34.190> for

the layer morphing earlier actually for

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.000 
the layer morphing earlier actually for
s2<00:04:35.330> that<00:04:35.780> he<00:04:35.840> canceled<00:04:36.230> a<00:04:36.320> layer<00:04:36.500> or<00:04:36.650> something

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
s2 that he canceled a layer or something

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.190 
s2 that he canceled a layer or something
I<00:04:37.220> don't<00:04:37.610> see<00:04:38.030> it<00:04:38.060> anywhere<00:04:38.840> but<00:04:39.110> the

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
I don't see it anywhere but the

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.700 
I don't see it anywhere but the
hydrolysed<00:04:39.710> in<00:04:39.860> being<00:04:41.140> put<00:04:42.140> down<00:04:42.170> so<00:04:42.620> the

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
hydrolysed in being put down so the

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:43.840 
hydrolysed in being put down so the
hydrolysed<00:04:43.100> didn't<00:04:43.310> down<00:04:43.460> this<00:04:43.610> might<00:04:43.760> have

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
hydrolysed didn't down this might have

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.720 
hydrolysed didn't down this might have
been<00:04:43.910> a<00:04:43.970> fake<00:04:44.270> out<00:04:44.420> or<00:04:44.570> something<00:04:44.840> from<00:04:45.050> s<00:04:45.140> to

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730

been a fake out or something from s to
but<00:04:46.730> I<00:04:46.760> think<00:04:47.000> he's<00:04:47.120> gonna<00:04:47.210> push<00:04:47.480> the<00:04:47.600> front

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840

there but I don't think that applies to

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.840 
there but I don't think that applies to
this<00:05:08.720> game<00:05:09.020> because<00:05:09.890> the<00:05:10.220> flash<00:05:10.430> isn't<00:05:10.640> out

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
this game because the flash isn't out

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.650 
this game because the flash isn't out
there<00:05:10.880> yet<00:05:11.270> but<00:05:11.540> the<00:05:11.810> Stargate<00:05:12.350> of<00:05:12.940> 4<00:05:13.940> oh<00:05:14.150> man

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.600 
there yet but the Stargate of 4 oh man
this<00:05:14.840> is<00:05:14.990> ridiculous<00:05:15.560> there's<00:05:16.400> only<00:05:16.490> one

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
this is ridiculous there's only one

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.400 
this is ridiculous there's only one
cannon<00:05:17.300> at<00:05:17.390> the<00:05:17.480> front<00:05:17.750> so<00:05:17.930> this<00:05:18.080> is<00:05:18.170> going<00:05:18.350> to

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
cannon at the front so this is going to

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.580 
cannon at the front so this is going to
be<00:05:18.530> a<00:05:18.560> huge<00:05:19.100> very<00:05:20.090> powerful<00:05:20.690> attack<00:05:20.990> from<00:05:21.170> s2

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
be a huge very powerful attack from s2

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.400 
be a huge very powerful attack from s2
as<00:05:21.830> he's<00:05:22.010> going<00:05:22.160> to<00:05:22.250> work<00:05:22.580> hydrolysed<00:05:23.450> towards

the<00:05:24.530> natural<00:05:24.890> expansion<00:05:25.190> still<00:05:25.610> no<00:05:25.730> Scout<00:05:26.000> at

the natural expansion still no Scout at

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.600 
the natural expansion still no Scout at
all<00:05:26.300> from<00:05:27.140> stats<00:05:27.530> he<00:05:27.740> has<00:05:27.770> not<00:05:27.980> even<00:05:28.100> gone<00:05:28.340> out

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
all from stats he has not even gone out

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.260 
all from stats he has not even gone out
and<00:05:28.940> to<00:05:29.360> attempt<00:05:29.780> a<00:05:29.870> scout<00:05:30.110> with<00:05:30.140> the<00:05:30.350> probe<00:05:31.270> so

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
and to attempt a scout with the probe so

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.700 
and to attempt a scout with the probe so
I'm<00:05:32.330> surprised<00:05:32.750> that<00:05:32.900> he<00:05:33.170> has<00:05:33.260> to<00:05:33.380> put<00:05:33.560> down<00:05:33.680> a

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
I'm surprised that he has to put down a

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.550 
I'm surprised that he has to put down a
second<00:05:34.130> cannon<00:05:35.080> since<00:05:36.080> he<00:05:36.170> doesn't<00:05:36.320> have<00:05:36.470> the

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
second cannon since he doesn't have the

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.990 
second cannon since he doesn't have the
Scout<00:05:36.860> he<00:05:36.980> wants<00:05:37.160> to<00:05:37.220> play<00:05:37.340> as<00:05:37.520> safely<00:05:37.790> as

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
Scout he wants to play as safely as

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.240 
Scout he wants to play as safely as
possible<00:05:38.230> but<00:05:39.230> going<00:05:39.560> for<00:05:39.770> a<00:05:39.800> greedy<00:05:40.040> build

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.250 
possible but going for a greedy build

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:41.620 
possible but going for a greedy build
like<00:05:40.400> this<00:05:40.430> without<00:05:40.700> putting<00:05:40.970> down<00:05:41.210> cannons

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630 
like this without putting down cannons

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.570 
like this without putting down cannons
is<00:05:41.780> going<00:05:42.020> to<00:05:42.110> hurt<00:05:42.260> him<00:05:42.440> a<00:05:42.500> lot<00:05:42.830> if<00:05:43.220> he<00:05:43.370> doesn't
