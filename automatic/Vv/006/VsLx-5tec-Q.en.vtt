 hello very good I am 1889 and we are in 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.290
 a vote a vote to choose 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:12.120
 that pokemon will be the main the starter 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.070
 to choose in pokemon and that is at 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.839
 to arrive is that I am falling and there are 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.700
 days to start the adventure I've 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.290
 left three comments that you must vote 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.700
 according to the pokemon that you want to choose 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.890
 You must vote a comment by giving 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.509
 light or another I that I know or give to 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.640
 three if you like the three as you want 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:28.230
 What I recommend is that you do not give 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.599
 I like it because what it does is like that 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.130
 download the poll and vote 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.339
 has a little practice the matter 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.010
 flight the starter that you start with 

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:39.239
 It will be very important because according to him 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.670
 I have to choose because of you 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.649
 comments the singing will vary is 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.839
 say depending on which of you 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.399
 You voted and have more votes to choose 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:50.370

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.920
 santander or vulva south depending on 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.510
 of what I voted here for you 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.399

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.339
 thanks to the wedges of the leaks 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.440
 we already know what kind will be the last 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:03.089
 evolutions of each one we begin 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.800
 porches pints in type pokemon 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:07.410
 plant we always start with the type 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.450
 pokÃ©dex that when it reaches its last 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.640
 evolution apart from being plant will be of 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.470
 type fight triqui the team pokemon 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.470
 water when it reaches its last evolution 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.450
 it will be sinister and peking the pokemon of 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.390
 fire type will be fire and psychic type 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.010
 when it reaches its last evolutionary stage 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.270

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.350
