able to evaluate her you know the IDI is

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.930 
able to evaluate her you know the IDI is
a<00:03:47.100> place<00:03:47.760> where<00:03:48.269> we<00:03:48.810> can<00:03:49.079> do<00:03:49.319> many<00:03:49.940> appropriate

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
a place where we can do many appropriate

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.449 
a place where we can do many appropriate

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
that well maybe not life-threatening

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.870 
that well maybe not life-threatening
I<00:03:55.350> think<00:03:55.769> she<00:03:55.859> may<00:03:56.010> just<00:03:56.190> have<00:03:56.340> gall<00:03:56.579> stones

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
I think she may just have gall stones

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.830 
I think she may just have gall stones
but<00:03:57.600> it's<00:03:58.260> very<00:03:58.530> difficult<00:03:58.980> to<00:03:59.130> get<00:03:59.220> an<00:03:59.370> answer

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
but it's very difficult to get an answer

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.990 
but it's very difficult to get an answer
through<00:04:00.840> the<00:04:01.139> healthcare<00:04:01.530> system<00:04:01.980> and<00:04:02.190> you

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
through the healthcare system and you

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.819 
through the healthcare system and you
know<00:04:03.150> that<00:04:03.480> this<00:04:03.750> is<00:04:03.930> not<00:04:04.109> an<00:04:04.260> abuse<00:04:04.620> of<00:04:04.769> the

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829

she's<00:04:07.019> been<00:04:07.200> nauseated<00:04:07.920> and<00:04:08.910> I<00:04:09.329> think<00:04:09.600> it's

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
she's been nauseated and I think it's

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.449 
she's been nauseated and I think it's
very<00:04:09.930> reasonable<00:04:10.200> to<00:04:10.709> do<00:04:10.859> the<00:04:10.980> workup<00:04:11.310> is

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
very reasonable to do the workup is

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.069 
very reasonable to do the workup is

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
trying to get her answers I think we

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.949 
trying to get her answers I think we
might<00:04:13.260> do<00:04:13.380> an<00:04:13.500> ultrasound<00:04:14.069> to<00:04:14.630> make<00:04:15.630> sure<00:04:15.810> your

as<00:06:52.470> you<00:06:52.650> know<00:06:52.800> mr.<00:06:53.190> Lai<00:06:54.000> had<00:06:54.270> an<00:06:54.360> episode<00:06:54.630> of

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:54.810 
as you know mr. Lai had an episode of

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.740 
as you know mr. Lai had an episode of
where<00:06:55.139> his<00:06:55.350> pressures<00:06:55.800> dropped<00:06:56.130> and<00:06:56.520> he<00:06:57.510> came

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:57.750 
where his pressures dropped and he came

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.719 
where his pressures dropped and he came
a<00:06:57.810> little<00:06:58.080> bit<00:06:58.320> on<00:06:58.500> respond<00:06:58.860> so<00:06:59.070> I<00:06:59.340> think<00:06:59.490> the

00:06:59.719 --> 00:06:59.729 
a little bit on respond so I think the

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:02.330 
a little bit on respond so I think the
toughest<00:07:00.060> part<00:07:00.120> is<00:07:00.479> having<00:07:01.470> that<00:07:01.800> instinct

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:02.340 
toughest part is having that instinct

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.550 
toughest part is having that instinct
that<00:07:02.550> it<00:07:02.699> requires<00:07:03.060> to<00:07:03.570> know<00:07:03.960> when<00:07:04.199> someone<00:07:04.530> is

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 
that it requires to know when someone is

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.650 
that it requires to know when someone is
truly<00:07:04.949> ill<00:07:05.310> cuz<00:07:05.760> you're<00:07:05.880> the<00:07:05.910> first<00:07:06.210> person<00:07:06.389> in

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:06.660 
truly ill cuz you're the first person in

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.960 
truly ill cuz you're the first person in
the<00:07:06.720> hospital<00:07:07.260> when<00:07:07.680> they<00:07:07.740> come<00:07:07.919> in<00:07:08.100> how<00:07:08.729> big

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:08.970 
the hospital when they come in how big

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:11.770
