00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.480
 nice all guys sonar up there already 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.230
 I'm here with this new video to do 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.480
 a small quoted review 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:28.560
 that is, to show them what I think of them and 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.240
 also as a holder a mod that I too 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.130
 I discovered today how to install given 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.750
 that I had been following it for a couple of months 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.290
 but I didn't really understand what the 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.160
 problem 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:41.160
 we are talking as you can see now 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:44.010
 of not enough items then before 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.489
 what is the night naf items the note 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:52.530
 fighting is kind of too many items 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:55.500
 but much more extensive than options 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.809
 which contains an example as you can 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.270
 see now that we will go on in 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.390
 video will be to see how it is 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.549
 they deal with objects or with what 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.979
 just serve that object 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.900
 pressing two different keys anyway 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.070
 let's start seeing this this right away 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.340
 pagination in quotes then here 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.450
 at the top we have the button for 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.060
 turn on or off the mode of 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.280
 canceled which will allow you to 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.890
 delete with just one click 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.600
 I go to activate it so I can 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.430
 see will be active with a single click 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.540
 I delete what I have in the inventory 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.880
 let's try the rain the creative I can 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.189
 go into survival as they are now 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.009
 normal creative as you can see 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.869
 the objects on the right will disappear 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:45.329
 creative plus that will allow me to have 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.240
 also the space for nature and 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.939
 very much more inventory space e 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.829
 then again survival we have to ilmac.net 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.619
 off and on 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.689
 sorry that will let me if I throw 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.079
 ground objects as you can 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:04.079
 see these will be lured to mine 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.680
 body with cakes see only the rai not 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:12.350
 he pulled me back into my hand 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:17.090
 then we have to set at sunset and 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:20.600
 sorry at dawn at noon at 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.550
 sunset and midnight and this for 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.209
 give us all life is the whole bar 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.920
 we will save our hunger here 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:31.310
 configuration of the inventories here 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.050
 other we would have lighting sub 7 or ci 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.520
 will allow you to go and decide that 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:40.280
 objects show in this menu then 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.980
 we will have the menu on the right where we can 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.260
 go to our pages as to many 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.810
 items if you have not seen the review 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.270
 I'll leave you in description is a lot 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.670
 similar indeed in quotation marks with the teeth 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:57.470
 if not that he adds some new ones 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:59.450
 object like the spoilers here we have the 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.770
 bar to search for something now on 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.630
 play english though you if you have 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.250
 wood you will look for wood for example 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:08.330
 I look for wood 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:11.570
 sorry good then when we have 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:14.630
 found an object we could press and there 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.790
 will show all kinds of various uses if you 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.340
 they do so now we are in the 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.870
 crafting as you can see the stairs then 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.019
 with this page I go on in 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:27.110
 crafting with these arrows instead change 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:31.580
 therefore category or as propellant as 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:36.860
 You are combusted or vo again 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:38.780
 crafting while with if i go into a 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.400
 particular object like the piston that 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:45.190
 has something more complex than 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:48.380
 crafting I press r and he will give me the crafting 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:52.940
 then there is this inventory that there 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:56.720
 lets go see how many 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.760
 objects I believe display on this 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.010
 menu anyway i'm not so sure 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:04.190
 but I think it's the same even though I don't have 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.640
 well understood this less precisely to what 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.640
 need 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:13.319
 so we finally have the options button 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.140
 where we go to see all the options 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:18.630
 of the then we have the qualification 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.870
 if we want it or not the mode 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:25.800
 chip that as you can see this menu 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:27.860
 here if we go and we can have several 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.450
 objects if we go to put site areas 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:33.600
 how will you see if I go to 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:37.680
 clicking these objects do not come to me 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:41.460
 data so I can't can't 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:44.730
 then let them have the utility mood that 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:47.310
 instead it only keeps what is useful and 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:49.470
 this can be set in the config 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.450
 of fashion 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.860
 however I prefer the way resais 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.320
 when I play in single player 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.180
 then we have the layout of 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:01.830
 minecraft pure the too many items 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:06.360
 classic so with this black we have 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:10.320
 the light and made in that there can be 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.940
 useful to know that the di is a block 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.770
 settings of the various of which now do not 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.110
 I'm here to give because they are some things 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:19.970
 more complex than usually anyone 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:24.570
 touch and then we have the highlights 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:26.580
 or to double click on this 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.260
 bar as you can see will become 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.660
 yellow what it means that if I go to 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.280
 search for example gras 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.310
 you will see that there is in my inventory 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:38.340
 of the grass so it is highlighted if 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.720
 I'm going to look for disk the same though if ad 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.490
 example is worth looking for hood 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.350
 as you can see in my inventory 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.510
 there is no wood so it will not come 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.580
 highlighted this could be useful 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:49.289
 anyway i don't like it very much 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:53.039
 also because it makes all the inventing a 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:55.500
 a bit darker, therefore, given this part 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:57.600
 to understand what is not enough items 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:02.910
 now we'll see how it is 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:05.250
 install then to install the not 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:09.810
 enough items you will need to have these two 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:12.000
 file plus minecraft forge for note 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:14.010
 then make it work to install it 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.580
 where we go we go on start we are up 

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:19.860
 percent appdata per percent and we beat 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.629
 send if you are on windows write 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.060
 winged on execute write the same 

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:27.000
 command and hit enter you are on windows 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:30.120
 xp sorry then let's get inside point 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.430
 minecraft let's go a little further 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.500
 the important thing has really been 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:37.319
 important if you are using programs 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:39.330
 like multi minecraft or minecraft 

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:42.210
 magic launcher 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.860
 the important thing is that the jar file from which 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.750
 you have never called kraft in 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.689
 minecraft dot jar so let's make a 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:50.729
 right button opened with which and rar is here 

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:53.430
 inside you will have to drag all that 

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:56.460
 which is forge after deleting the 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:58.590
 half folder does it anyway will leave you 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:01.500
 a video here in description for how 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:03.750
 install fashions done this we will have to 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:06.090
 go to minecraft point go inside 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:07.620
 the folder corra mod 

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:09.300
 if you have not created it, there is one and 

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:12.990
 call them this way core 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:16.229
 mod we open and drag ourselves inside 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:19.409
 these two files or with codes that 

00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:22.110
 ncore and not enough items done this 

00:07:19.409 --> 00:07:24.569
 it's very simple fashion is full 

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:26.759
 installed you will only have to open yours 

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:30.690
 minecraft and launch it all here 

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:32.580
 I think this video is very simple 

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:34.500
 can end here there is nothing else to 

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:36.270
