00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:14.490
 Hi, I'm lying and I'm going to teach you 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.490
 make this rose cake pop 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:20.750
 We're going to need crumbly biscuits 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:23.240
 a little bit of toilet cream in this case 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.640
 it's chocolate strawberry flavor that we're going 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.900
 to melt I like to mix 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.490
 personally the candy mails of the 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.710
 returned brand although these are what we see 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.300
 here with white chocolate brand 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.640
 value that you can find in any 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.730
 supermarket then we will also be a 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.910
 little pink fondant and these 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.470
 pages 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.190
 well what we are going to do now is 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.510
 mix the wÃ¡ter cream 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.100
 with the sponge cake 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.920
 let's do it carefully because 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.820
 It costs a little if it's easier for you 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.820
 you can do with your hands 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.440
 and we are going to mix 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.640
 until a homogeneous mass is obtained 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.130
 well you see this is the final aspect that 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.079
 must have the toilet cream mixture with 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.549
 the sponge cake and now what we're going to do 

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:13.229
 they are not the typical balls of the cake 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.550
 pops but we have to make cones 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.650
 like this one 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.620
 we take a little bit to try to make them 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.900
 little ones 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.560
 if it gives us more books it's very big and 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.560
 they are going to weigh too much 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.210
 and let's learn the base a little 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.320
 and it is to ensure that everyone has the same 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.360
 size 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.490
 As we already have all of our 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.979
 pops the following is going to be melting the 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.260
 chocolate I use an elongated container 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.520
 like this one and be careful because the 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.110
 white chocolate is burned with a lot 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.540
 ease so when you put it in the 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:54.290
 microwave do it at intervals of 10 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:56.960
 seconds and stir constantly 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.710
 with the melted chocolate we introduce 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.710
 a little the straw 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.590
 and we play pop not much 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.870
 and now we are putting all the pops to 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.730
 the fridge for at least two hours 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.799
 before being carlos by the fridge 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.180
 let's make the petals you do not need 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:21.580
 no type of special cutters 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.769
 You can perfectly do the 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.209
 petals with a mouthpiece like this 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.209
 or as a cookie cutter 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.210
 we stretch with the fondant roller 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.730
 sure that as fine as possible 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.240
 and we cut 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.340
 and we try to make the edges 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.930
 and so make all our petals good 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:14.330
 Well, it's time to set up our 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.330
 pop we introduce in liquid chocolate 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.500
 we remove the excess 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.650
 do not worry if there are lumps 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.210
 and now let's put the objects 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.120
 Y 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.860
 i 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.200
 Y 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.590
 all right 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:32.710
 I hope you liked it we'll see you in 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.710
 the next video tutorial see you later
