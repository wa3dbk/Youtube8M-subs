tricks the choice scarf to this gun tank
right<00:00:26.010> off<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.310> bat<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:27.050> receives<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.199> damp

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
right off the bat and receives a damp

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.370 
right off the bat and receives a damp
rock<00:00:28.680> which<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:29.039> pretty<00:00:29.429> interesting<00:00:29.789> because

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
rock which is pretty interesting because

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.780 
rock which is pretty interesting because
that<00:00:31.380> means<00:00:31.529> Scott's<00:00:31.949> using<00:00:32.279> some<00:00:32.520> kind<00:00:32.550> of

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
that means Scott's using some kind of

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.180 
that means Scott's using some kind of
rain<00:00:33.000> dance<00:00:33.239> team<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:34.500> second<00:00:34.829> pursuit

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
rain dance team and the second pursuit

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.330 
rain dance team and the second pursuit
will<00:00:35.489> kill<00:00:35.910> this<00:00:36.300> Banette<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:36.960> now<00:00:37.710> the

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
will kill this Banette and now the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.880 
will kill this Banette and now the
opponent<00:00:38.670> goes<00:00:38.790> into<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.120> Meganium<00:00:39.890> because

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
opponent goes into a Meganium because

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.639 
opponent goes into a Meganium because
this<00:00:41.160> gun<00:00:41.370> tank<00:00:41.520> can't<00:00:41.790> do<00:00:41.910> much<00:00:42.440> Scott's<00:00:43.440> we

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
this gun tank can't do much Scott's we

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.170 
this gun tank can't do much Scott's we
do<00:00:43.739> sound<00:00:43.980> into<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.370> licky<00:00:44.640> licky<00:00:44.940> as

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
do sound into the licky licky as

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.100 
do sound into the licky licky as
Meganium<00:00:46.079> sets<00:00:46.530> up<00:00:46.649> reflect<00:00:47.100> now<00:00:48.090> now<00:00:49.050> the

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
Meganium sets up reflect now now the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.990 
Meganium sets up reflect now now the
Meganium<00:00:49.710> sets<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.129> leech<00:00:50.309> seed<00:00:50.579> which

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
Meganium sets of the leech seed which

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.830 
Meganium sets of the leech seed which
isn't<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.480> big<00:00:51.660> deal<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:52.820> now<00:00:53.820> look<00:00:54.390> he<00:00:54.660> gets

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
isn't a big deal and now look he gets

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.020 
isn't a big deal and now look he gets
the<00:00:54.960> rain<00:00:55.170> dance<00:00:55.410> set<00:00:56.100> up<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.550> that's<00:00:56.879> really

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
the rain dance set up and that's really

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.959 
the rain dance set up and that's really
nice<00:00:57.500> so<00:00:58.500> this<00:00:58.980> little<00:00:59.129> icky<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.609> pretty<00:00:59.850> much

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
nice so this little icky is pretty much

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.900 
nice so this little icky is pretty much
a<00:01:00.030> support<00:01:00.660> with<00:01:01.410> ulikki<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.980> now<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.789> is

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
a support with ulikki and now that is

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.870 
a support with ulikki and now that is
set<00:01:03.120> up<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.480> rain<00:01:03.979> the<00:01:04.979> local<00:01:05.280> icky<00:01:05.489> goes<00:01:05.670> for

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
set up the rain the local icky goes for

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.030 
set up the rain the local icky goes for
the<00:01:05.970> explosion<00:01:06.330> which<00:01:07.170> surprisingly<00:01:07.770> doesn't

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
the explosion which surprisingly doesn't

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.300 
the explosion which surprisingly doesn't
do<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.670> much<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:09.330> only<00:01:09.479> does<00:01:09.659> half<00:01:10.040> which<00:01:11.040> is

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
do that much it only does half which is

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.640 
do that much it only does half which is
kind<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.210> disappointing<00:01:12.330> because<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.500> was

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
kind of disappointing because I was

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.850 
kind of disappointing because I was
expecting<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.250> do<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.610> little<00:01:14.970> more<00:01:15.320> but<00:01:16.320> it

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
expecting it to do a little more but it

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.679 
expecting it to do a little more but it
ends<00:01:17.189> up<00:01:17.280> not<00:01:17.490> being<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.970> big<00:01:18.180> deal<00:01:18.420> because

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
ends up not being a big deal because

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.649 
ends up not being a big deal because
scouting<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:19.650> go<00:01:19.830> into<00:01:20.009> this<00:01:20.130> electrode<00:01:20.790> go

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
scouting this go into this electrode go

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.600 
scouting this go into this electrode go
for<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.990> super<00:01:22.259> effective<00:01:22.530> life<00:01:22.920> orb<00:01:23.189> signal

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
for the super effective life orb signal

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.539 
for the super effective life orb signal
beam<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.180> will<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:25.189> try<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.250> take<00:01:26.520> down

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
beam and that will and try to take down

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.789 
beam and that will and try to take down
this<00:01:26.880> Meganium<00:01:27.420> but<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.750> doesn't<00:01:28.049> quite<00:01:28.170> take

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
this Meganium but it doesn't quite take

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.249 
this Meganium but it doesn't quite take
down<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.070> Meganium<00:01:29.780> but<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.869> good<00:01:31.020> thing<00:01:31.079> is

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
down this Meganium but the good thing is

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.080 
down this Meganium but the good thing is
the<00:01:31.500> Meganium<00:01:32.009> is<00:01:32.159> just<00:01:32.400> going<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.670> heal<00:01:32.880> up

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
the Meganium is just going to heal up

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.109 
the Meganium is just going to heal up
and<00:01:33.390> because<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.470> rain<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:35.100> in<00:01:35.280> place<00:01:35.579> so<00:01:35.939> this

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
and because the rain is in place so this

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.810 
and because the rain is in place so this
is<00:01:36.150> doesn't<00:01:36.720> heal<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.290> much<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:38.280> only<00:01:38.460> heals

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
is doesn't heal that much it only heals

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.020 
is doesn't heal that much it only heals
a<00:01:38.970> quarter<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.659> health<00:01:39.979> so<00:01:40.979> eventually<00:01:41.189> on

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
a quarter of the health so eventually on

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.310 
a quarter of the health so eventually on
the<00:01:43.020> electrodes<00:01:43.920> going<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.189> take<00:01:44.369> down<00:01:44.579> this

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
the electrodes going to take down this

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.950 
the electrodes going to take down this
Meganium<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.409> signal<00:01:46.799> beam<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.840> Meganium<00:01:48.840> is

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
Meganium a signal beam and Meganium is

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.600 
Meganium a signal beam and Meganium is
going<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.229> use<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.500> synthesis<00:01:49.950> again<00:01:50.220> just<00:01:50.549> to

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
going to use the synthesis again just to

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.700 
going to use the synthesis again just to
try<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.299> stall<00:01:51.750> out<00:01:52.290> more<00:01:52.740> rain<00:01:53.100> time<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:54.710> the

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
try to stall out more rain time and the

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.340 
try to stall out more rain time and the
bad<00:01:56.130> thing<00:01:56.369> about<00:01:56.399> Meganium<00:01:57.149> is<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:57.869> his

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
bad thing about Meganium is that his

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.280 
bad thing about Meganium is that his
reflect<00:01:58.890> wears<00:01:59.159> down<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.840> that's<00:02:00.840> really<00:02:01.020> no

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
reflect wears down and that's really no

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.359 
reflect wears down and that's really no
big<00:02:01.469> deal<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:02.329> this<00:02:03.329> signal<00:02:03.659> beam<00:02:04.040> will<00:02:05.040> take

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
big deal and this signal beam will take

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.550 
big deal and this signal beam will take
down<00:02:05.610> this<00:02:05.880> Meganium<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:07.079> that's<00:02:07.290> really
