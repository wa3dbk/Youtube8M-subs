I've got a Chronos deluxe from lush skin
I've<00:00:15.750> also<00:00:15.900> got<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.260> couple<00:00:16.500> of<00:00:16.740> wildfires<00:00:17.250> the

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
I've also got a couple of wildfires the

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.790 
I've also got a couple of wildfires the
other<00:00:17.609> wildfire<00:00:18.150> is<00:00:18.330> plugged<00:00:19.170> into<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.529> SATA

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
other wildfire is plugged into a SATA

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.019 
other wildfire is plugged into a SATA
cable<00:00:20.160> hanging<00:00:20.279> off<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.609> back<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:20.789> this

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
cable hanging off the back of this

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.509 
cable hanging off the back of this
machine<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.800> so<00:00:22.800> basically<00:00:23.100> I<00:00:23.220> want<00:00:23.460> to

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
machine and so basically I want to

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.130 
machine and so basically I want to
switch<00:00:23.699> from<00:00:23.730> having<00:00:24.119> two<00:00:24.269> test<00:00:24.510> benches<00:00:24.900> to

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
switch from having two test benches to

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.870 
switch from having two test benches to
three<00:00:25.350> test<00:00:25.560> benches<00:00:25.949> so<00:00:26.010> I'll<00:00:26.279> have<00:00:26.490> instead

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
three test benches so I'll have instead

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.670 
three test benches so I'll have instead
of<00:00:26.939> an<00:00:27.060> AMD<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.449> Intel<00:00:27.750> I<00:00:27.990> want<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.529> have<00:00:28.650> a

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
of an AMD and Intel I want to have a

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.910 
of an AMD and Intel I want to have a
2011<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.519> 1155<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.510> an<00:00:30.570> am3+<00:00:31.019> so<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:31.650> can

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
2011 and 1155 and an am3+ so that I can

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.700 
2011 and 1155 and an am3+ so that I can
easily<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:32.940> quickly<00:00:33.090> compare<00:00:33.809> anything<00:00:34.440> on

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
easily and quickly compare anything on

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.900 
easily and quickly compare anything on
any<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.070> major<00:00:35.190> platforms<00:00:35.790> without

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
any of the major platforms without

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.740 
any of the major platforms without
swapping<00:00:36.450> CPU<00:00:36.809> coolers<00:00:37.200> etc<00:00:37.829> etc<00:00:37.890> etc<00:00:38.360> so<00:00:39.360> on

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
swapping CPU coolers etc etc etc so on

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.900 
swapping CPU coolers etc etc etc so on
now<00:00:40.320> they<00:00:40.559> finally<00:00:40.829> fix<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.280> stability

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
now they finally fix the stability

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.360 
now they finally fix the stability
issues<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.719> people<00:00:43.170> were<00:00:43.410> having<00:00:43.770> with<00:00:43.950> some

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
issues that people were having with some

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.430 
issues that people were having with some
blue<00:00:44.579> screens<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.149> whatnot<00:00:45.510> with<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.260> Sam

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
blue screens and whatnot with the Sam

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.990 
blue screens and whatnot with the Sam
for<00:00:46.649> state<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:46.980> three<00:00:47.129> drives<00:00:47.340> I'm<00:00:47.789> going<00:00:47.940> to

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
for state of three drives I'm going to

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.520 
for state of three drives I'm going to
go<00:00:48.090> ahead<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.450> update<00:00:48.719> these<00:00:49.020> three<00:00:49.260> drives

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
go ahead and update these three drives

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.060 
go ahead and update these three drives
and<00:00:49.800> then<00:00:49.890> I'm<00:00:50.070> going<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:51.199> well<00:00:52.199> get<00:00:52.739> my<00:00:52.860> test

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
and then I'm going to well get my test

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.130 
and then I'm going to well get my test
benches<00:00:53.370> set<00:00:53.579> up<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.239> figured<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:54.960> might<00:00:55.079> as

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
benches set up so I figured I might as

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.990 
benches set up so I figured I might as
well<00:00:55.230> do<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.440> video<00:00:55.620> about<00:00:55.890> how<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.160> update<00:00:56.550> the

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
well do a video about how to update the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.939 
well do a video about how to update the
firmware<00:00:57.329> on<00:00:57.570> your<00:00:57.600> SSD<00:00:58.020> so<00:00:58.379> in<00:00:58.469> this<00:00:58.559> case<00:00:58.770> I

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
firmware on your SSD so in this case I

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.920 
firmware on your SSD so in this case I
downloaded<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.489> Patriot<00:00:59.910> SSD<00:01:00.300> updater<00:01:00.629> so<00:01:00.899> I

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
downloaded the Patriot SSD updater so I

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.930 
downloaded the Patriot SSD updater so I
obviously<00:01:01.410> got<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:01.920> one<00:01:02.129> off<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.309> Patriot

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
obviously got that one off the Patriot

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.700 
obviously got that one off the Patriot

other things that you have to factor in
I<00:01:26.549> tried<00:01:27.000> this<00:01:27.119> on<00:01:27.240> an<00:01:27.360> AMD<00:01:27.600> chipset<00:01:28.229> this<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.619> a

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
I tried this on an AMD chipset this is a

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.130 
I tried this on an AMD chipset this is a
modern<00:01:28.920> AMD<00:01:29.340> chips<00:01:29.579> at<00:01:29.729> 990<00:01:30.150> FX<00:01:30.479> board<00:01:30.810> and

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
modern AMD chips at 990 FX board and

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.410 
modern AMD chips at 990 FX board and
this<00:01:31.680> error<00:01:31.950> doubt<00:01:32.220> after<00:01:32.430> about<00:01:32.820> half<00:01:32.880> a

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
this error doubt after about half a

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.990 
this error doubt after about half a
second<00:01:33.869> so<00:01:34.530> what<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:34.890> had<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.280> do<00:01:35.430> was<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.759> tried

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
second so what I had to do was I tried

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.899 
second so what I had to do was I tried
switching<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.450> HCI<00:01:36.869> mode<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.409> didn't<00:01:37.680> help

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
switching to HCI mode that didn't help

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.370 
switching to HCI mode that didn't help
so<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:38.939> moved<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.270> over<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.570> an<00:01:39.810> Intel<00:01:40.110> board

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
so I moved it over to an Intel board

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.499 
so I moved it over to an Intel board
this<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.710> p55<00:01:41.250> board<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.909> now<00:01:42.000> it's<00:01:42.180> working

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
this is a p55 board and now it's working

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.020 
this is a p55 board and now it's working
with<00:01:42.659> no<00:01:42.810> issues<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:43.409> only<00:01:43.890> certain<00:01:44.340> chipsets

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
with no issues so only certain chipsets

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.120 
with no issues so only certain chipsets
are<00:01:45.360> going<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.899> be<00:01:46.200> able<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.500> update<00:01:46.860> the

firmware correctly you do want to be in

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.530 
firmware correctly you do want to be in
HCI<00:01:50.579> mode<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.299> is<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.750> factor<00:01:52.170> as<00:01:52.530> well<00:01:52.890> and

other<00:01:57.540> than<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:57.810> can't<00:01:58.049> really<00:01:58.200> think<00:01:58.320> of

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
other than that I can't really think of

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.080 
other than that I can't really think of
anything<00:01:58.649> No<00:01:59.159> look<00:01:59.430> at<00:01:59.549> that<00:01:59.670> it's<00:01:59.820> complete

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
anything No look at that it's complete

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.429 
anything No look at that it's complete

utility and the patriot firmware because

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.790 
utility and the patriot firmware because
they<00:02:12.180> are<00:02:12.390> using<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.930> same<00:02:13.110> flash<00:02:13.379> these<00:02:13.650> are

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
they are using the same flash these are

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.059 
they are using the same flash these are
all

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069

hoggle<00:02:14.370> chip<00:02:14.579> drives<00:02:15.060> with<00:02:16.129> 2281<00:02:17.129> controller

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
hoggle chip drives with 2281 controller

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.379 
hoggle chip drives with 2281 controller
so<00:02:18.120> as<00:02:18.389> far<00:02:19.290> as<00:02:19.349> the<00:02:19.980> actual<00:02:20.489> hardware<00:02:21.239> is

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:21.389 
so as far as the actual hardware is

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:23.360 
so as far as the actual hardware is
concerned<00:02:21.900> they<00:02:22.139> are<00:02:22.200> basically<00:02:22.680> identical

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
concerned they are basically identical

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.390 
concerned they are basically identical
so<00:02:24.150> let's<00:02:24.359> see<00:02:24.659> if<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.139> mush<00:02:25.319> can<00:02:25.530> drive<00:02:27.290> will

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
so let's see if the mush can drive will

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.429 
so let's see if the mush can drive will
allow<00:02:29.400> me<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:30.599> update<00:02:30.840> it
