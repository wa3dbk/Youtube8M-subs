00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.320
 series start her this incredibly 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.719
 beautiful first spring day on 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.980
 summer is already sweating over yes and 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.510
 I thought today it starts again 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.920
 patrick tips to a channel again 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.550
 I have already refreshed 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.300
 again up here but today 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.300
 start as normal 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.440
 basics and pretty easy skateboarding 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.879
 could actually do it all 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.739
 just like the skate makes in 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.200
 any lines with a word or 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.790
 Somewhere you can always carry something 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:54.570
 also combined with everything possible 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:57.519
 It's pretty easy why that's what 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.129
 my imagination is actually relative 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:01.510
 how you really wanted to have the foot 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.550
 very little bit angled 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.869
 But it's not really because it's infected 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.450
 slaves mostly and europeans but 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:09.220
 actually fucking shit resists that 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.080
 then have the advantage that just 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.759
 could pull an ollie first and then 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.289
 only later will be the case 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:16.780
 that's really nice 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:18.160
 first time topped then turns right 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.920
 nice you could really nice 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.840
 Patching from the beginning it is okay though 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.550
 the club is pretty sticky on the floor 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.759
 you also not care if the non 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.220
 better at the beginning because it is like 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.710
 said file matter matter is and 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.619
 Although in the foot just completely immediately 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.570
 raus skin that the film looks like 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.530
 main thing from the stop then with you 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.479
 then you have also in the square 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.680
 yes my specialty and help to make 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.070
 As I said I have to actually 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.980
 actually 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.840
 is pretty pops hat off behind the 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.550
 continue pretty sideways away 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.220
 count so that's the advantage if 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.050
 Do not worry if that comes in the corner 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.310
 otherwise he will look like that 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.340
 because the foot of all ships to the day 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:06.320
 will put away really nice then 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:09.619
 the natural becomes straight and I like 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.420
 papa said to the features for relatively 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:16.880
 get out late and work summit relatively 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.750
 high I hope I have you 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.670
 helped a little bit 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.730
 Now there are a few more tips for the 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.730
 st
