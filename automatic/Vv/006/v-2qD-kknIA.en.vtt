00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:09.070
 This is because the 787 is expected to be a medium-sized aircraft that will lead the new generation of passenger aircraft 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:18.220
 It's been about a year since we entered service in the autumn of the night 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:23.820
 I'm concerned about the blockbuster that already has 800 orders or more 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.820
 The first reason is the cruising distance and good fuel efficiency 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:35.329
 Fuel efficiency is improved by 20% compared to the previous pure enemy and the cruising distance 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:41.809
 In other words, the distance that can be continued to fly by one refueling has increased by 30% 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:44.510
 For example, from Japan, the medium-sized aircraft so far is only on the American West Coast and Eastern Europe 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:51.850
 We did only go up eh 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:54.450
 This is 787 and was now able to go directly to the west Kamata East Coast of the United States Europe 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:01:01.260
 Well, such a region 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:03.330
 The core cities in these areas are not large enough to be profitable with large machines . 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:10.080
 Although there was no regular route 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:14.340
 Since profitable if the 787 from about 350 seats of 200 in the medium-sized machine 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.909
 Mitsumi and new route are established 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:23.939
 78 but breaks the distance wall of medium-sized aircraft 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:29.899
 The fierce competition is taking place due to the increased freedom of Dongairo to set up routes 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.899
 It is even said that the world's aerial map may change 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:40.600
 One of the reasons why the 787 was able to dramatically increase the cruising distance is the fuselage and wings etc. 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:45.960
 Part of the traditional metal instead 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:50.790
 The expectation was lightened by using a new material of carbon fiber 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:57.540
 In addition though is that there is ironic became another driving force behind 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:02:03.390
 It was electrical system including battery which serious trouble arose this time 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:12.030
 Previous airliners used metal cables and metal parts to investigate wings etc. 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:15.670
 Recent passenger plane has become the mechanism to move to convey the information from the cockpit by an electrical signal 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:21.160
 Boeing 787 did it even more 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:28.270
 All the devices that have been moved by the force of air through pipes 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:32.100
 This also the weight becomes lighter in place of the mechanism for the hydraulic device also moves much electrical 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.100
 It led to the improvement of the cruising distance 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:42.750
 Also, in order to keep the pressure of thin air of the air constant, it is 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:47.630
 I was sending high pressure air compressed by the engine to the room 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:52.970
 In 787 we changed to the method of compressing air by electricity 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:56.710
 This further reduces the load on the engine and prevents the engine output from dropping. 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.710
 Cruising distance I is extended 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:09.390
 The 787 has improved its performance with a mechanism that relies on electricity to operate in this way 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:13.860
 It is a high-performance lithium-ion battery that supports such a mechanism 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:21.660
 Boeing introduced lithium-ion batteries for the first time 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:27.080
 It can store three times as much electricity with the same weight as a conventional battery, but this is 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.080
 At the stage I have become Achilles tendon 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:39.689
 The 787 has two electric rooms under the cockpit floor and below the cabin behind the fuselage, each identical 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.689
 Loading a lithium ion battery
