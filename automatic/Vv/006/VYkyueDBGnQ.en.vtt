00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:06.600
 Hi, I 'm cute and today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:08.849
 how the meat stopped the pastor what 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.129
 we're going to need is a pineapple, not the pineapple 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.230
 complete but yes a little bit I have chile 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:15.569
 chipotle cream can get it dry 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.349
 it would be much better I have sauce 

00:00:15.569 --> 00:00:21.529
 English played poorly and this is a shot is of 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:23.220
 the only brand I know can 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.890
 take it off 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.749
 let's not say it's not obligatory too 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.329
 we need vinegar 

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:32.610
 I have half an onion onion 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:34.829
 white a big onion here I have what 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.190
 that is pork steak pork 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:43.350
 of pork I bought three rooms in 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:46.800
 kilo I also have cumin I have garlic the 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.899
 concentrate from nor switzerland to three sheets of 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.760
 laurel three black peppers three cloves 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.100
 and if you ask me how much is it 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.660
 use me here I have these spoons that 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.239
 they are the meters that you used to make 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.579
 desserts and I'm using the second 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.629
 that is being like 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:06.270
 ok I have three wide chiles since 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.729
 it is wrinkled and I also have four 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.020
 guajillo chili onions already the 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.080
 I had taught the chiles 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.909
 unveil and pass them water uses 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.159
 the pineapple as you see I will not use it 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.869
 all is just a bit the rest 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.960
 is going to be to make a fresh water or 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.850
 something out there we 're going to start in 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.260
 squares and this we're going to put a 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.610
 side 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:33.000
 steak meat steaks 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.980
 can we say that use as well as 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.540
 they come more or less that's how they're used 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.580
 the taquerias already know that they have as 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.250
 the top this where they insert the 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.350
 steak and pineapple but I to make it a 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:48.620
 little simpler easier I'm going to 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.620
 split into very small squares 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.390
 and that's how we're going to use it 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.140
 I already have my chiles well but well 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.390
 but well soaked so in the 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.420
 blender I'm going to place half of the 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.739
 onion that was using the one that 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.000
 I said I'm going to put the pieces of pineapple 

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:12.480
 You can put as many as you want 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.340
 but remember that pineapple is sweet 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.459
 I will also add the chiles these 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.000
 they will not take any of the water from the 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.310
 juice 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.050
 nothing so if you give them some 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.970
 little seed you have to be careful that 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.790
 it grinds very well if we're not going to have 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.920
 that strain it 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.900
 I will also add everything I had 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.390
 on the plate 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:38.120
 if they do not have cumin they can replace it 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.310
 by thyme no problem 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.769
 we will place it very well we are going to 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.260
 put the achiote as I tell you this is not 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.299
 it is mandatory that they put it 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.000
 but I like it I like the taste that 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:52.010
 gives so that's why I add it 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.739
 more or less I put the same amount that 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.170
 have a cube of concentrate I'm going to 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:00.530
 put 5 chipotle chilies because I've 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.540
 tested and there are no peaks os 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.580
 and in this system they were a little 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.100
 I'm going to remove the seeds too 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.830
 let's add a little sauce 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:14.540
 English and some corn juice 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.540
 they are only a few drops 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:23.510
 we add it and we are going to put a 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:27.250
 more trickle of vinegar we put the salt and 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.250
 we are going to take it to liquefy 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:33.920
 As a special or different tip I'm going to 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:36.620
 say that I like to put it in these 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.550
 that are like clay pots because 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.740
 it gives as another flavor 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:45.410
 different to the food so as I already 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:49.310
 I have it split into small pieces the meat already 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:52.440
 is split into small pieces I will put the 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.270
 meat and then I put the marinade 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.760
 and you have to come to them very well if you 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.100
 they are doing in steak you have to put 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.650
 first he dresses we bathed very well in 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.740
 adobo we continue with the following and so 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.020
 successively until this is ready 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:10.170
 is recommended recommended to be done 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.910
 from a night before for him to grab 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.480
 very well 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:18.660
 the aroma so that it is more penetrated 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.980
 our meat is worth here I have the 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.620
 sauce that I'm taking that is from 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.180
 tomato tomato green chile and also 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.870
 I have the pot where I'm going to put the 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.850
 meat that has a little bit of meat 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.830
 oil can add it or they can omit 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.780
 the oil I like so that it 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.290
 brown as they see, empty it completely 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:39.720
 everything and it starts to sew I'm going to leave 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:42.660
 there he is 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:45.000
 consume all their juices until that 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.220
 half dry and adore a little to 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.289
 that gives that effect that has been cut 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.360
 from the trunk 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:53.819
 and how I missed the last clip 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.189
 here I leave you a photograph of more or 

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:58.379
 less as they were my tacos you put 

00:04:56.189 --> 00:05:01.439
 lemon cilantro onion a little bit of 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:03.119
 roasted onion with the salsita and this 

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:05.099
 I would be everything I hope you liked it 

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:09.499
 very much the recipe put it in 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:09.499
 practice and I see them the next bye
