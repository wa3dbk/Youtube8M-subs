 canal soy félix rodríguez from blog tomo

 online today we are going to see a series of 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.840
 trick tips and small tips that 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.210
 we can use the short girls for 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.700
 see us much more stylized let's see 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.740
 a total of 10 different tips in the 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.109
 that we are going to take advantage of both the clothes 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.000
 as add-ons as well as 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.279
 attitude to see us much more 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.350
 stylized much higher and get 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.300
 a much more favorable visual effect 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.130
 If you want to learn how to get out much more 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.840
 party like mario and feel safer 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.109
 At the time of dressing, keep watching the 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.109
 video 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.900
 let's start with the feet and let's 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.630
 go up evidently to see us 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.340
 higher we will use shoes 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.580
 heel we will choose preferably 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.650
 colors claritos like the new color that 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.390
 being practically the same color as 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.850
 our leg is going to stylize 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.280
 much more shoes that have strips 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.199
 crossed in front we are also going to 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.760
 use much more legs on 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.739
 everything if it has a strip that crosses us 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.989
 over the instep if you are not one of the 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.970
 that supports wearing heels daily 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.100
 platforms are also going to benefit us 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.170
 very much from sports to shoes 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.690
 a little more feminine pants 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.509
 long black and dark colors 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:16.119
 we are going to make the leg much more 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:17.830
 slender you choose especially pants 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.509
 high shot because that way your legs get 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.950
 you will see much more elongated stripes 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:23.440
 verticals also favor us 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.380
 lot especially pants 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.000
 diplomatic lines that are stripes that do not 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.070
 there is a lot of color difference between 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.810
 them and they are very finite stripes and if 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.000
 you want to wear short pants too 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.860
 that is to detail the skirts that more 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.929
 favor the short girls are the 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.550
 short skirts always above the 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:42.130
 knees the minimum skirts 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.560
 nothing flattering we are going to leave alone to 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.450
 the tall girls do not turn the skirts 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.090
 that have too much flight that are 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.040
 too much with things because the effect goes 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.980
 to be the complete opposite of skirts with 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.690
 porte to are much more flattering and if 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.670
 He also has vertical suits 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.530
 you will see much more stylized 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.480
 dresses and the monkeys that are going to 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.310
 favor are also the cortitos 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.980
 preferably we will use colors 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.080
 solid without prints the sets two 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.640
 pieces that are the same color or with the 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.460
 same pattern also I 'm not so 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.390
 great if you want to dress with prints 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.430
 use those that are very very very 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.350
 little ones because that way you'll see much more 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.480
 great beyond you do not wear too much clothes 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.300
 wide because you'll see much more 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.000
 little girl chooses clothes that feel good 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.160
 that fits you fit that you mark a 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.890
 little your body when choosing tops 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.660
 and blouses v-shaped necklines 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.970
 they're going to make it look a lot higher 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.830
 preferably if we use pants 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.500
 that has gotten high let's use 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.510
 short tops so we can see each other 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.700
 legs much more elongated 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.890
 and the torso looks more short not 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.420
 favors nothing the shirts that are 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.730
 too long 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.680
 If they are long, wear a pair of trousers better 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.079
 short low t-shirts that are 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.459
 too wide too bulky 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:57.310
 they will also do us too much 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:59.349
 Bajitas uses something that fits you more in 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.060
 carved and that you favor the figure 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.519
 Jackets can also help us 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.769
 look much taller with jackets 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.769
 kimonos anything you can take 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.569
 open that create vertical lines that 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.280
 fall and use much more 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.950
 figure preferably do not carry 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.569
 too long jackets always by 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.190
 above the knee the jacket is 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.959
 too long they will make us see 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.180
 much smaller jackets 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.819
 Toreritas are going to sit us very well 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.859
 when you choose accessories always in 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.989
 the pockets the smaller it is 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:30.730
 better because being a small bag 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.980
 you will see much bigger 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.920
 bags that are too bulky to 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.480
 any very large multi backpacks 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.760
 what you wear will make you see much more 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.310
 little girl we also feel great the 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.470
 bandoliers and more if they are fringes that 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.060
 they now carry a lot because the effect is going to 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.280
 be much more stylized 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.989
 other accessories such as necklaces and 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.300
 how the handkerchiefs can help us 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.010
 appear taller choose collars that 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.220
 be tiny that are not very 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.110
 bulky never long necklaces 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.720
 handkerchiefs carry them simply hung 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.519
 around the neck do not wrap them in the 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.220
 neck because they will look much more fragile 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:08.410
 the earrings better if they are long and 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.720
 that the little earrings are going to 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.150
 make see maybe a little shorter but 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.370
 the long earrings will use us 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.530
 plus the neck and will seem much more 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.840
 high if you want to wear a hat better 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.700
 a little fairy hat short because 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.220
 wear a hat with a family 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.360
 too big we're going to look 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.639
 thumbtacks the best way to carry the 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.340
 hair always collected in a high ponytail 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.720
 that makes us look much more stylized 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.780
 much higher 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.000
 some monkey some horse ponytail and 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.250
 especially the most important point is 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.169
 have a proper attitude walks 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.960
 erect walks with safety 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:46.450
 feel comfortable with what you're wearing 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.300
 and comfortable as you are, always choose 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:52.020
 clothing that feels good to you 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.789
 you feel good and you dress the way 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.370
 if you go through life with a lot of security 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:57.690
 it will look much bigger much higher 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.090
 and of course you will not happen 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.310
