00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.890 
doing like um astronomy stuff I think
that<00:06:19.460> would<00:06:19.550> be<00:06:19.670> more<00:06:19.790> interesting<00:06:19.970> not<00:06:20.870> only

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:20.900 
that would be more interesting not only

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.660 
that would be more interesting not only
because<00:06:21.380> I<00:06:21.410> want<00:06:21.650> to<00:06:21.710> be<00:06:21.800> a<00:06:21.830> space<00:06:22.040> pirate<00:06:22.280> but

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:22.670 
because I want to be a space pirate but

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:24.610 
because I want to be a space pirate but
just<00:06:23.060> like<00:06:23.270> in<00:06:23.330> general<00:06:23.540> I<00:06:23.990> think<00:06:24.020> that<00:06:24.380> space

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:24.620 
just like in general I think that space

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:29.320 
just like in general I think that space
is<00:06:24.650> more<00:06:24.980> interesting<00:06:25.400> so<00:06:25.640> a<00:06:28.210> bunch<00:06:29.210> of<00:06:29.270> people

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:29.330 
is more interesting so a bunch of people

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:30.640 
is more interesting so a bunch of people
who<00:06:29.600> are<00:06:29.690> really<00:06:29.720> into<00:06:30.170> science

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:30.650 
who are really into science

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.040 
who are really into science
be<00:06:31.130> responding<00:06:31.580> with<00:06:31.729> oh<00:06:31.910> my<00:06:32.600> gosh<00:06:32.810> you

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:33.050 
be responding with oh my gosh you

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:34.450 
be responding with oh my gosh you
obviously<00:06:33.590> don't<00:06:33.800> understand<00:06:34.280> how

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.460 
obviously don't understand how

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.310 
obviously don't understand how
incredible<00:06:35.030> the<00:06:35.150> earth<00:06:35.270> is<00:06:35.540> I<00:06:35.750> know<00:06:35.810> the<00:06:36.080> earth

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:36.320 
incredible the earth is I know the earth

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.219 
incredible the earth is I know the earth
is<00:06:36.410> super<00:06:36.770> incredible<00:06:37.220> I<00:06:37.400> just<00:06:37.729> I<00:06:38.060> don't<00:06:38.990> want

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:39.229 
is super incredible I just I don't want

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:41.350 
is super incredible I just I don't want
to<00:06:39.289> be<00:06:39.380> studying<00:06:39.800> every<00:06:40.250> single<00:06:40.610> element<00:06:40.820> of<00:06:41.240> a

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 
to be studying every single element of a

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.159 
to be studying every single element of a
plant<00:06:41.690> I<00:06:41.930> don't<00:06:42.830> I<00:06:43.130> don't<00:06:43.870> my<00:06:44.870> brain<00:06:45.139> doesn't

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:45.169 
plant I don't I don't my brain doesn't

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:48.640 
plant I don't I don't my brain doesn't
latch<00:06:45.770> on<00:06:46.009> to<00:06:46.130> it<00:06:46.280> I<00:06:46.370> don't<00:06:46.430> care<00:06:47.259> it's<00:06:48.259> great

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:57.740 
with the scientific community that's

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.950 
with the scientific community that's
watching<00:06:57.919> this<00:06:58.190> right<00:06:58.340> now<00:06:58.400> I'm<00:06:59.030> sorry<00:06:59.360> my
