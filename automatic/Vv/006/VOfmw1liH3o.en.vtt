00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
this but I got this map for my little

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.490 
this but I got this map for my little
sister<00:02:39.730> and<00:02:40.120> then<00:02:40.209> also<00:02:40.360> one<00:02:40.930> of<00:02:40.959> my<00:02:41.110> other

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
sister and then also one of my other

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.190 
sister and then also one of my other
bridesmaids<00:02:42.130> because<00:02:42.459> they<00:02:42.910> both<00:02:43.150> travel<00:02:43.989> a

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
bridesmaids because they both travel a

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.020 
bridesmaids because they both travel a
lot<00:02:44.530> and<00:02:44.890> so<00:02:45.100> I<00:02:45.130> thought<00:02:45.400> this<00:02:45.579> was<00:02:45.819> something

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
lot and so I thought this was something

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.390 
lot and so I thought this was something
very<00:02:46.420> unique<00:02:46.750> and<00:02:47.140> special<00:02:47.769> that<00:02:47.799> I<00:02:48.010> can<00:02:48.220> give

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
very unique and special that I can give

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.630 
very unique and special that I can give
them<00:02:48.640> that<00:02:48.850> you<00:02:49.660> know<00:02:49.810> so<00:02:50.350> a<00:02:50.380> lot<00:02:50.470> about<00:02:50.829> like

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
them that you know so a lot about like

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.309 
them that you know so a lot about like
who<00:02:51.850> they<00:02:52.000> are<00:02:52.030> as<00:02:52.269> people<00:02:52.299> it<00:02:52.810> was<00:02:52.930> more<00:02:53.140> like

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
who they are as people it was more like

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.710 
who they are as people it was more like
a<00:02:53.350> more<00:02:53.620> personal<00:02:54.190> focused<00:02:54.670> so<00:02:55.450> I<00:02:55.510> thought

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
a more personal focused so I thought

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.780 
a more personal focused so I thought
this<00:02:55.930> was<00:02:56.109> just<00:02:56.139> like<00:02:56.350> a<00:02:56.410> really<00:02:56.680> cool<00:02:56.980> idea<00:02:57.220> so

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
this was just like a really cool idea so

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.970 
this was just like a really cool idea so
you<00:02:57.880> can<00:02:58.030> see<00:02:58.209> it's<00:02:58.329> like<00:02:58.389> this<00:02:58.569> huge<00:02:59.019> map<00:02:59.380> you

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
you can see it's like this huge map you

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.009 
you can see it's like this huge map you
scratch<00:03:00.549> off<00:03:00.819> all<00:03:01.180> the<00:03:01.359> places<00:03:01.600> that<00:03:01.810> you've

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
scratch off all the places that you've

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.440 
scratch off all the places that you've
been<00:03:02.049> to<00:03:02.380> so<00:03:02.560> you<00:03:02.620> know<00:03:02.859> like<00:03:03.069> where<00:03:03.819> you<00:03:04.000> visit

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
been to so you know like where you visit

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.879 
been to so you know like where you visit
it<00:03:04.540> in<00:03:04.660> the<00:03:04.780> world<00:03:04.959> and<00:03:05.319> I<00:03:05.380> just<00:03:05.410> thought<00:03:05.680> that

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:05.889 
it in the world and I just thought that

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:07.140 
it in the world and I just thought that
was<00:03:06.040> really<00:03:06.069> really<00:03:06.489> cool

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
was really really cool

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.539 
was really really cool
and<00:03:07.420> then<00:03:07.660> I'm<00:03:07.930> still<00:03:08.260> working<00:03:08.680> on<00:03:08.829> some<00:03:09.250> other

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
and then I'm still working on some other

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:11.490 
and then I'm still working on some other
things<00:03:09.850> for<00:03:10.060> my<00:03:10.180> other<00:03:10.329> bridesmaids<00:03:11.049> to<00:03:11.319> give

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
things for my other bridesmaids to give

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.319 
things for my other bridesmaids to give
them<00:03:11.739> because<00:03:12.489> I<00:03:12.639> really<00:03:12.850> want<00:03:13.030> to<00:03:13.060> make<00:03:13.209> it

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
them because I really want to make it

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:15.059 
them because I really want to make it
personal<00:03:13.510> so<00:03:13.989> I<00:03:14.109> think<00:03:14.200> a<00:03:14.470> really<00:03:14.500> good<00:03:14.950> idea

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
personal so I think a really good idea

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.059 
personal so I think a really good idea
is<00:03:15.880> you<00:03:16.630> don't<00:03:16.810> have<00:03:17.049> to<00:03:17.200> do<00:03:17.319> all<00:03:17.350> of<00:03:17.680> this<00:03:17.799> like

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
is you don't have to do all of this like

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:19.960 
is you don't have to do all of this like
I<00:03:18.190> said<00:03:18.220> you<00:03:18.579> can<00:03:18.730> maybe<00:03:18.940> just<00:03:19.060> do<00:03:19.389> the<00:03:19.540> jewel

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
I said you can maybe just do the jewel

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.580 
I said you can maybe just do the jewel
especially<00:03:20.390> if<00:03:20.450> you're<00:03:20.570> under<00:03:20.690> budget<00:03:21.110> the

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
especially if you're under budget the

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.010 
especially if you're under budget the
jewelry<00:03:21.950> is<00:03:22.010> awesome<00:03:22.460> because<00:03:22.810> everyone<00:03:23.810> will

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
jewelry is awesome because everyone will

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.020 
jewelry is awesome because everyone will
be<00:03:24.110> matching<00:03:24.350> at<00:03:24.650> your<00:03:24.800> wedding<00:03:25.190> for<00:03:25.670> jewelry

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:28.460 
and you can give it as a gift so this is

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.410 
and you can give it as a gift so this is
a<00:03:28.490> great<00:03:28.730> idea

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
a great idea

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.550 
a great idea
the<00:03:30.020> bouquet<00:03:30.260> you<00:03:30.560> can<00:03:30.890> also<00:03:31.130> do<00:03:31.520> as<00:03:31.670> a<00:03:31.700> gift<00:03:32.240> so

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
the bouquet you can also do as a gift so

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
the bouquet you can also do as a gift so
obviously<00:03:33.560> something<00:03:34.070> they're<00:03:34.220> gonna<00:03:34.340> need

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
obviously something they're gonna need

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.550 
obviously something they're gonna need
anyways<00:03:35.060> but<00:03:35.450> you<00:03:35.630> put<00:03:35.840> a<00:03:35.870> lot<00:03:36.050> of<00:03:36.140> time<00:03:36.320> and

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
anyways but you put a lot of time and

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.770 
anyways but you put a lot of time and
energy<00:03:36.680> and<00:03:37.010> effort<00:03:37.370> into<00:03:37.520> it<00:03:37.820> and<00:03:38.270> that's

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
energy and effort into it and that's

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.030 
energy and effort into it and that's
something<00:03:38.960> that<00:03:39.410> they<00:03:39.530> could<00:03:39.680> keep<00:03:39.860> the

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
something that they could keep the

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.950 
something that they could keep the
bouquets<00:03:40.400> and<00:03:40.700> then<00:03:41.210> another<00:03:41.510> thing<00:03:41.780> if

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:41.960 
bouquets and then another thing if

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.020 
bouquets and then another thing if
someone<00:03:42.290> loves<00:03:42.440> to<00:03:42.620> travel<00:03:43.010> the<00:03:43.280> scratch<00:03:43.610> map

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
someone loves to travel the scratch map

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.050 
someone loves to travel the scratch map
is<00:03:44.300> a<00:03:44.330> great<00:03:44.750> idea<00:03:44.900> and<00:03:45.620> then<00:03:46.430> you<00:03:46.760> don't<00:03:46.910> just

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
is a great idea and then you don't just
