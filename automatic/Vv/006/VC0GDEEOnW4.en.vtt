last<00:00:14.219> week<00:00:14.610> we<00:00:14.820> analyzed<00:00:15.269> black<00:00:15.660> third

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
last week we analyzed black third

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.650 
last week we analyzed black third
milkweed<00:00:16.710> g6<00:00:17.340> in<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.640> Scandinavian<00:00:17.970> defense

milkweed g6 in the Scandinavian defense

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.779 
milkweed g6 in the Scandinavian defense
and<00:00:18.990> today<00:00:19.710> we<00:00:20.010> will<00:00:20.130> take<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.369> different

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
and today we will take a different

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.420 
and today we will take a different
approach<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.480> opening<00:00:21.779> in<00:00:22.050> this<00:00:22.890> position

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
approach to the opening in this position

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.660 
approach to the opening in this position
after<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:24.000> first<00:00:24.330> movie<00:00:24.570> for<00:00:24.810> d5<00:00:25.740> whites<00:00:26.400> by

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
after the first movie for d5 whites by

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.330 
after the first movie for d5 whites by
far<00:00:27.029> most<00:00:27.269> popular<00:00:27.810> continuation<00:00:28.619> is<00:00:28.800> it

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
far most popular continuation is it

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.420 
far most popular continuation is it
takes<00:00:29.760> d5<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.750> move<00:00:31.380> which<00:00:31.590> we<00:00:31.800> have<00:00:31.980> analyzed

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
takes d5 and move which we have analyzed

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.030 
takes d5 and move which we have analyzed
in<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.759> last<00:00:33.000> couple<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:33.420> episodes<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.860> is

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
in the last couple of episodes and it is

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.400 
in the last couple of episodes and it is
probably<00:00:35.579> also<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:36.000> best<00:00:36.480> move<00:00:36.780> white<00:00:37.050> can't

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
probably also the best move white can't

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.860 
probably also the best move white can't
play<00:00:37.680> here<00:00:37.980> but<00:00:38.520> even<00:00:38.700> though<00:00:39.030> many<00:00:39.570> players

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
play here but even though many players

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.660 
play here but even though many players
are<00:00:40.230> uncomfortable<00:00:40.890> with<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.190> variation

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
are uncomfortable with the variation

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.389 
are uncomfortable with the variation
which<00:00:41.850> arise<00:00:42.239> off<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.719> desperation<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.649> some

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
which arise off the desperation and some

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.549 
which arise off the desperation and some
seek<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.850> find<00:00:45.030> alternative<00:00:45.750> options<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.410> this

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
seek to find alternative options to this

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.250 
seek to find alternative options to this
move<00:00:46.829> but<00:00:47.610> even<00:00:47.969> if<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.329> isn't<00:00:48.840> an<00:00:48.930> issue<00:00:49.079> for

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
move but even if this isn't an issue for

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.799 
move but even if this isn't an issue for
you<00:00:49.530> it's<00:00:49.800> always<00:00:50.160> good<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.640> have<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.149> less

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
here well if white by some reason

are<00:01:03.449> some<00:01:03.600> other<00:01:03.780> variations<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.680> play<00:01:04.920> and

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
are some other variations to play and

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.480 
are some other variations to play and
among<00:01:05.729> them<00:01:05.939> we<00:01:06.150> can<00:01:06.330> find<00:01:06.360> 9<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.049> c3<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.680> c4

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
among them we can find 9 to c3 and c4

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.420 
among them we can find 9 to c3 and c4
Knight<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.450> c3<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:10.080> quite<00:01:10.470> playable<00:01:10.799> but<00:01:11.250> in

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
Knight to c3 is quite playable but in

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.520 
Knight to c3 is quite playable but in
today's<00:01:11.729> episode<00:01:12.030> we'll<00:01:12.600> take<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.930> look<00:01:13.140> at<00:01:13.409> the

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
today's episode we'll take a look at the

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.490 
today's episode we'll take a look at the
more<00:01:13.710> aggressive<00:01:14.040> d4<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.810> first<00:01:16.110> thing<00:01:16.350> we

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
more aggressive d4 the first thing we

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.039 
more aggressive d4 the first thing we
see<00:01:16.680> here<00:01:17.009> is<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.250> y<00:01:17.759> has<00:01:18.000> sacrificed<00:01:18.270> upon

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
see here is that y has sacrificed upon

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.230 
see here is that y has sacrificed upon
and<00:01:19.320> there<00:01:19.950> is<00:01:20.070> really<00:01:20.250> no<00:01:20.580> sense<00:01:20.909> in<00:01:21.210> not

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
and there is really no sense in not

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.770 
and there is really no sense in not
taking<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.110> if<00:01:22.590> black<00:01:23.250> would<00:01:23.520> play<00:01:23.580> e6<00:01:24.479> though

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
taking it if black would play e6 though

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.050 
taking it if black would play e6 though
we<00:01:25.200> have<00:01:25.320> entered<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.009> French<00:01:26.310> defense<00:01:26.729> and

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
we have entered the French defense and

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.560 
we have entered the French defense and
if<00:01:27.750> c6<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.560> played<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.520> opening<00:01:29.759> instance

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570

these<00:01:34.320> most<00:01:34.710> probably<00:01:35.369> won't<00:01:35.579> be<00:01:35.790> chosen

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
these most probably won't be chosen

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.140 
these most probably won't be chosen
since<00:01:36.960> flack<00:01:37.350> by<00:01:37.560> his<00:01:37.710> first<00:01:38.040> move<00:01:38.369> decided<00:01:39.030> to

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
since flack by his first move decided to

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.719 
since flack by his first move decided to
pay<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.420> Scandinavian<00:01:40.290> defense<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.950> not<00:01:41.430> one

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
pay the Scandinavian defense and not one

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.020 
pay the Scandinavian defense and not one
of<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.939> other<00:01:42.090> two<00:01:42.799> but<00:01:43.799> it's<00:01:44.189> always<00:01:44.460> good<00:01:45.000> to

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
of the other two but it's always good to

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.780 
of the other two but it's always good to
note<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.780> opportunity<00:01:46.380> exists<00:01:46.860> black

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
note that the opportunity exists black

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.539 
note that the opportunity exists black
should<00:01:48.090> now<00:01:48.270> take<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.899> pawn<00:01:49.140> on<00:01:49.170> e4<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.040> no

doubt about it

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.649 
doubt about it
why<00:01:52.290> white<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:52.860> gives<00:01:53.159> away<00:01:53.520> upon<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.119> black

why white you gives away upon and black

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.859 
why white you gives away upon and black
