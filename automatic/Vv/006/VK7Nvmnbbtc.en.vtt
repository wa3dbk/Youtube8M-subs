00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:09.370
 Working here we made it 

00:00:03.979 --> 00:00:09.370
 a mash previously titled 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.939
 has appeared 3 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.720
 420 degrees 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.650

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.650
 valentina 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:56.510
 similar to the similar 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.790
 we have these accessories that 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.630
 good the turn to the left thermomix 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.360
 but here as we have it then 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.909
 we use these spoons to remove 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.620
 some have only in the surveys 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:20.490
 has the butterfly takes over 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.490
 well more or less 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.330
 As you can see, it is taking 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.330
 really cook 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.190
 it has quite powerful 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.740
 star 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.040
 Yes Yes 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:49.240
 and is already finishing cutting then 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.240
 we will continue 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.950
 people 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.090
 but I can also be desired 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.860
 all engines 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.860
 and if they look good 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.230
 5 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.690
 twenty 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:04.130
 so it's about 10 minutes benzia 3 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.130
 first in the chopped 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.930
 If we do not touch anything, it stays in 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.829
 heat maintenance 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:24.060
 but I want I want to show you 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.060
 our second 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.700
 good as I do not have good angle 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.240

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.780
 This is not everything 

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:56.729
 we give to open 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:05.180
 on a reel 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:07.970
 is the takeover nothing there is already a 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:11.330
 broth pill I do not know how you know 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:14.419
 because I liked or smell with this 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.840
 good cold but for you to do 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:16.840
 an idea 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.050
 if we want to make it more liquid with 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.569
 Water 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.249
 registered this year for me you 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:29.860
 as well 

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:32.169
 of the liquid because it happened like that 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.719
 and digs and I like it better so not so 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:40.169
 liquid we go and then if we can 

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:40.169
 reheat the big ones here we go
