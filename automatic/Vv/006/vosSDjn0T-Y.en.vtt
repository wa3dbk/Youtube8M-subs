beginnings of a snare snare consists of

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.790 
beginnings of a snare snare consists of
a<00:00:45.160> couple<00:00:45.400> pieces<00:00:45.550> this<00:00:45.910> is<00:00:46.030> the<00:00:46.150> Y<00:00:46.300> branch

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
a couple pieces this is the Y branch

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.729 
a couple pieces this is the Y branch
pretty<00:00:47.800> much<00:00:47.980> it<00:00:48.309> consists<00:00:48.970> of<00:00:49.260> one<00:00:50.260> branch<00:00:50.559> on

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
pretty much it consists of one branch on

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:51.720 
pretty much it consists of one branch on
this<00:00:50.890> side<00:00:51.070> you're<00:00:51.220> gonna<00:00:51.280> put<00:00:51.519> it<00:00:51.579> in<00:00:51.670> the

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
this side you're gonna put it in the

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.930 
this side you're gonna put it in the
ground<00:00:52.650> one<00:00:53.650> branch<00:00:53.890> here<00:00:54.250> with<00:00:54.519> your<00:00:54.670> trigger

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
ground one branch here with your trigger

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.060 
ground one branch here with your trigger
stick<00:00:55.269> notched<00:00:55.930> into<00:00:56.199> another<00:00:56.530> stick<00:00:56.860> right

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
stick notched into another stick right

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.490 
stick notched into another stick right
here<00:00:57.120> so<00:00:58.120> we'll<00:00:58.329> show<00:00:58.510> you<00:00:58.540> once<00:00:58.930> I<00:00:59.050> get<00:00:59.170> more

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
here so we'll show you once I get more

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.649 
here so we'll show you once I get more
of<00:00:59.589> the<00:00:59.650> sticks<00:00:59.890> made<00:01:00.070> but<00:01:00.280> right<00:01:00.430> now<00:01:00.580> this<00:01:01.330> is

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:01.659 
of the sticks made but right now this is

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:04.200 
of the sticks made but right now this is
the<00:01:01.869> Y<00:01:01.960> branch<00:01:02.260> that's<00:01:02.470> gonna<00:01:02.589> hold<00:01:02.890> the<00:01:03.879> stick

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
the Y branch that's gonna hold the stick

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.690 
the Y branch that's gonna hold the stick
with<00:01:04.659> the<00:01:04.960> Slipknot<00:01:05.440> right<00:01:05.680> here<00:01:05.950> so

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
with the Slipknot right here so

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.190 
with the Slipknot right here so
basically<00:01:06.820> what's<00:01:07.180> gonna<00:01:07.270> happen<00:01:07.360> is<00:01:07.869> the

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
basically what's gonna happen is the

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.710 
basically what's gonna happen is the
animal<00:01:08.560> is<00:01:08.950> going<00:01:09.310> to<00:01:09.490> push<00:01:10.360> on<00:01:10.540> the<00:01:10.630> trigger

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
animal is going to push on the trigger

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.000 
animal is going to push on the trigger
stick<00:01:11.080> because<00:01:11.200> you're<00:01:11.380> gonna<00:01:11.470> bait<00:01:11.710> it<00:01:11.860> with

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
stick because you're gonna bait it with

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.399 
stick because you're gonna bait it with
food<00:01:12.520> peanut<00:01:12.909> butter<00:01:13.060> or<00:01:13.210> whatever<00:01:13.270> and<00:01:13.869> it

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
food peanut butter or whatever and it

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.200 
food peanut butter or whatever and it
pushes<00:01:14.619> down<00:01:14.740> and<00:01:15.159> it<00:01:15.250> slips<00:01:15.580> out<00:01:15.700> of<00:01:15.760> here<00:01:16.090> and

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
pushes down and it slips out of here and

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.390 
pushes down and it slips out of here and
it<00:01:16.299> flings<00:01:16.570> up<00:01:16.780> on<00:01:16.900> the<00:01:16.990> sapling<00:01:17.380> so<00:01:18.010> I'm<00:01:18.310> gonna

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
it flings up on the sapling so I'm gonna

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.310 
it flings up on the sapling so I'm gonna
go<00:01:18.549> ahead<00:01:18.640> and<00:01:18.760> start<00:01:19.210> making<00:01:19.479> some<00:01:19.630> more<00:01:19.780> of

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
go ahead and start making some more of

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.780 
go ahead and start making some more of
the<00:01:20.470> components<00:01:20.950> and<00:01:21.100> I'll<00:01:21.310> get<00:01:21.460> back<00:01:21.580> to<00:01:21.610> you

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
the components and I'll get back to you

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.399 
the components and I'll get back to you
and<00:01:22.030> what<00:01:22.180> are<00:01:22.240> we<00:01:22.299> trying<00:01:22.420> to<00:01:22.509> catch<00:01:22.720> I<00:01:22.990> don't

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
and what are we trying to catch I don't

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:24.960 
and what are we trying to catch I don't
know<00:01:23.500> whatever<00:01:23.799> there's<00:01:24.400> not<00:01:24.610> a<00:01:24.640> lot<00:01:24.880> of

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
know whatever there's not a lot of

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.640 
know whatever there's not a lot of
wildlife<00:01:25.299> out<00:01:25.450> here<00:01:25.509> last<00:01:26.200> night<00:01:26.350> we<00:01:26.439> saw<00:01:26.560> an

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
wildlife out here last night we saw an

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:27.179 
wildlife out here last night we saw an
armadillo

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:27.189 
armadillo

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:28.800 
armadillo
so<00:01:27.340> we<00:01:28.060> kind<00:01:28.240> of<00:01:28.299> just<00:01:28.390> see<00:01:28.479> if<00:01:28.570> we<00:01:28.630> got<00:01:28.750> an

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
so we kind of just see if we got an

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.090 
so we kind of just see if we got an
armadillo<00:01:29.170> I<00:01:29.320> wouldn't<00:01:29.590> eat<00:01:29.680> it<00:01:29.799> or<00:01:29.920> anything

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
armadillo I wouldn't eat it or anything

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.179 
armadillo I wouldn't eat it or anything
but<00:01:30.720> we<00:01:31.720> have<00:01:31.900> seen<00:01:32.229> there's<00:01:32.619> been<00:01:32.829> like

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:33.189 
but we have seen there's been like

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:34.980 
but we have seen there's been like
rabbits<00:01:33.700> and<00:01:33.939> raccoons<00:01:34.299> and<00:01:34.689> all<00:01:34.749> that<00:01:34.840> kind

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
rabbits and raccoons and all that kind

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.029 
rabbits and raccoons and all that kind
of<00:01:35.020> stuff<00:01:35.109> out<00:01:35.320> here<00:01:35.439> we<00:01:35.590> don't<00:01:35.740> really<00:01:35.829> see

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:36.039 
of stuff out here we don't really see

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:38.130 
of stuff out here we don't really see
them<00:01:36.100> too<00:01:36.280> often<00:01:36.609> but<00:01:36.969> we're<00:01:37.359> just<00:01:37.390> gonna<00:01:37.630> set

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
them too often but we're just gonna set

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.450 
them too often but we're just gonna set
it<00:01:38.229> up<00:01:38.350> just<00:01:38.380> for<00:01:38.619> the<00:01:38.770> fun<00:01:38.920> of<00:01:38.950> it<00:01:39.100> and<00:01:39.189> see

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
it up just for the fun of it and see

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.940 
it up just for the fun of it and see
what<00:01:39.579> happens

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
what happens

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.929 
what happens
all<00:01:41.950> right<00:01:42.070> so<00:01:42.310> what<00:01:42.460> I've<00:01:42.549> done<00:01:42.670> here<00:01:42.880> is

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
all right so what I've done here is

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:45.330 
all right so what I've done here is
chosen<00:01:43.539> a<00:01:43.659> green<00:01:44.020> sapling<00:01:44.380> that<00:01:44.890> has<00:01:45.069> some

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
chosen a green sapling that has some

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.980 
chosen a green sapling that has some
elasticity<00:01:46.030> to<00:01:46.149> it<00:01:46.179> you<00:01:46.450> never<00:01:46.569> want<00:01:46.840> to<00:01:46.869> use

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
elasticity to it you never want to use

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.419 
elasticity to it you never want to use
dead<00:01:47.200> branches<00:01:47.560> because<00:01:47.829> dead<00:01:48.009> branches<00:01:48.280> will

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
dead branches because dead branches will

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:50.969 
dead branches because dead branches will
just<00:01:48.579> snap<00:01:48.729> on<00:01:48.969> you<00:01:49.119> but<00:01:49.810> pretty<00:01:50.350> much<00:01:50.409> I<00:01:50.799> went

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
just snap on you but pretty much I went

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.999 
just snap on you but pretty much I went
a<00:01:51.280> good<00:01:51.729> ways<00:01:52.299> up<00:01:52.600> the<00:01:52.719> tree<00:01:52.960> like<00:01:53.319> 2/3<00:01:53.710> of<00:01:53.859> the

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
a good ways up the tree like 2/3 of the

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.569 
a good ways up the tree like 2/3 of the
way<00:01:54.130> and<00:01:54.280> just<00:01:54.369> tied<00:01:54.579> a<00:01:54.729> regular<00:01:55.090> it's<00:01:55.990> like<00:01:56.140> a

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
way and just tied a regular it's like a

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.950 
way and just tied a regular it's like a
I<00:01:57.579> tied<00:01:58.119> a<00:01:58.149> Siberian<00:01:58.630> hitch<00:01:58.749> it's<00:01:58.929> a

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
I tied a Siberian hitch it's a

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.179 
I tied a Siberian hitch it's a
quick-release<00:01:59.170> not<00:01:59.590> but<00:01:59.829> it<00:01:59.920> holds<00:02:00.130> really

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 
quick-release not but it holds really

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:02.819 
quick-release not but it holds really
tight<00:02:00.520> and<00:02:00.969> the<00:02:01.689> snare<00:02:01.990> is<00:02:02.200> all<00:02:02.350> about<00:02:02.590> tension

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:02.829 
tight and the snare is all about tension

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:04.800 
tight and the snare is all about tension
so<00:02:03.280> I<00:02:03.310> made<00:02:03.549> just<00:02:03.909> a<00:02:03.999> regular<00:02:04.329> this<00:02:04.450> is<00:02:04.509> your

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
so I made just a regular this is your

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.929 
so I made just a regular this is your
trigger<00:02:05.020> stick<00:02:05.319> here<00:02:05.619> it's<00:02:06.340> just<00:02:06.549> a<00:02:06.639> regular

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:06.939 
trigger stick here it's just a regular

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:08.669 
trigger stick here it's just a regular
stick<00:02:07.270> but<00:02:07.479> with<00:02:07.569> a<00:02:07.600> notch<00:02:07.869> cut<00:02:07.899> in<00:02:08.380> the<00:02:08.500> end

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.570 
stick but with a notch cut in the end
here<00:02:08.950> and<00:02:09.130> if<00:02:10.090> you<00:02:10.179> follow<00:02:10.420> me<00:02:10.509> down<00:02:10.780> this<00:02:11.050> way

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
here and if you follow me down this way

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.949 
here and if you follow me down this way
those<00:02:12.580> two<00:02:12.850> sticks<00:02:13.180> that<00:02:13.450> I<00:02:13.540> was<00:02:13.660> working<00:02:13.900> on

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
those two sticks that I was working on

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.280 
those two sticks that I was working on
earlier<00:02:14.170> this<00:02:14.620> is<00:02:15.069> your<00:02:15.250> Y<00:02:15.459> stick<00:02:16.110> so<00:02:17.110> what<00:02:17.260> I

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
earlier this is your Y stick so what I

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.500 
earlier this is your Y stick so what I
did<00:02:17.560> was<00:02:17.860> it's<00:02:18.310> just<00:02:18.520> basically<00:02:18.940> a<00:02:19.060> fork<00:02:19.330> and<00:02:19.480> a

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
did was it's just basically a fork and a

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.040 
did was it's just basically a fork and a
branch<00:02:19.770> and<00:02:20.770> you<00:02:21.700> just<00:02:21.850> bury<00:02:22.540> that<00:02:22.750> in<00:02:22.930> the

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
branch and you just bury that in the

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.650 
branch and you just bury that in the
dirt<00:02:23.260> I'm<00:02:23.440> gonna<00:02:23.590> go<00:02:23.880> make<00:02:24.880> a<00:02:24.940> fresh<00:02:25.240> hole<00:02:25.450> here

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
dirt I'm gonna go make a fresh hole here

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.000 
dirt I'm gonna go make a fresh hole here
keep<00:02:26.080> it<00:02:26.200> nice<00:02:26.350> and<00:02:26.380> tight

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
keep it nice and tight

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
underneath here and then I made this

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.530 
underneath here and then I made this
other<00:02:32.180> stick<00:02:32.510> which<00:02:32.900> is<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:33.500> I<00:02:34.480> don't<00:02:35.480> know

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
underneath the Y branch and then this

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.759

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
place on this side of it

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.080 
place on this side of it
just<00:03:00.680> so<00:03:00.920> you<00:03:01.310> want<00:03:01.489> to<00:03:01.549> make<00:03:01.640> sure<00:03:01.790> you<00:03:01.879> get<00:03:01.970> it

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
nice and firmly on the ground so the

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.440 
nice and firmly on the ground so the
tree<00:03:03.799> doesn't<00:03:03.980> pull<00:03:04.280> the<00:03:04.910> sticks<00:03:05.180> out<00:03:05.299> of<00:03:05.329> the

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
tree doesn't pull the sticks out of the

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.270 
tree doesn't pull the sticks out of the
ground<00:03:05.510> so<00:03:06.290> then<00:03:06.440> what<00:03:06.650> you'll<00:03:06.799> see<00:03:06.950> here<00:03:07.220> is

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
ground so then what you'll see here is

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.550 
ground so then what you'll see here is
the<00:03:07.790> notches<00:03:08.209> line<00:03:08.510> up<00:03:08.660> perfectly<00:03:08.810> here<00:03:09.410> and

arm or some kind of limb so if the
animal<00:03:29.299> gets<00:03:29.569> caught<00:03:29.810> and<00:03:30.019> they<00:03:30.410> can<00:03:30.530> chew<00:03:30.680> the

animal gets caught and they can chew the

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:31.930 
animal gets caught and they can chew the
way<00:03:30.920> out<00:03:31.040> of<00:03:31.160> this<00:03:31.250> rope<00:03:31.430> that's<00:03:31.609> why<00:03:31.730> you<00:03:31.790> want

way out of this rope that's why you want

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.909 
way out of this rope that's why you want
to<00:03:32.000> use<00:03:32.030> wire<00:03:32.380> theoretically<00:03:33.380> but<00:03:33.620> just<00:03:33.829> for

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:33.919 
to use wire theoretically but just for

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:36.370 
to use wire theoretically but just for
demonstration<00:03:33.950> purposes<00:03:34.989> you<00:03:35.989> tie<00:03:36.139> just<00:03:36.349> a

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
demonstration purposes you tie just a

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.770 
demonstration purposes you tie just a
regular<00:03:36.709> slip<00:03:36.950> knot<00:03:37.130> and<00:03:37.389> you<00:03:38.389> make<00:03:38.540> sure<00:03:38.690> you

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
regular slip knot and you make sure you

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.180 
regular slip knot and you make sure you
open<00:03:38.959> it<00:03:39.200> up<00:03:39.290> enough<00:03:41.410> and<00:03:42.410> then<00:03:42.859> you<00:03:42.950> want<00:03:43.130> to

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
open it up enough and then you want to

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.849

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
pushing down the slip knot tightens and

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.729 
pushing down the slip knot tightens and
tightens<00:04:04.549> and<00:04:04.940> doesn't<00:04:05.209> come<00:04:05.510> loose<00:04:05.739> so

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
tightens and doesn't come loose so

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.240 
tightens and doesn't come loose so
basically<00:04:07.250> you<00:04:07.549> have<00:04:07.730> yourself<00:04:08.090> an<00:04:08.209> animal

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
basically you have yourself an animal

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.369 
basically you have yourself an animal
trapped<00:04:10.250> in<00:04:10.340> the<00:04:10.430> snare<00:04:10.639> so<00:04:11.480> that's<00:04:11.660> just<00:04:12.230> a

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
learned something so what happened here

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.159 
learned something so what happened here
John<00:04:28.180> the<00:04:29.180> snare<00:04:29.479> that<00:04:29.660> we<00:04:29.720> set<00:04:29.900> out<00:04:30.020> last

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 
John the snare that we set out last

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.640 
John the snare that we set out last
night<00:04:30.380> got<00:04:30.680> tripped<00:04:30.979> you<00:04:31.220> can<00:04:31.370> see<00:04:32.410> judging<00:04:33.410> by

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
night got tripped you can see judging by

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.909 
night got tripped you can see judging by
this<00:04:33.729> loop<00:04:34.729> here<00:04:35.180> the<00:04:35.720> Slipknot<00:04:36.169> it

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
this loop here the Slipknot it

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:38.800 
this loop here the Slipknot it
definitely<00:04:37.610> got<00:04:37.729> around<00:04:38.060> some<00:04:38.390> things<00:04:38.419> either

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
definitely got around some things either

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.110 
definitely got around some things either
neck<00:04:39.110> or<00:04:39.289> limb<00:04:39.469> and<00:04:39.860> it<00:04:40.310> either<00:04:40.400> struggled<00:04:41.000> and

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
neck or limb and it either struggled and

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.770 
neck or limb and it either struggled and
got<00:04:41.300> away

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
got away

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.320 
got away
or<00:04:41.960> it<00:04:42.500> wrapped<00:04:43.460> around<00:04:43.610> it<00:04:43.940> and<00:04:44.030> it<00:04:44.180> just

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
or it wrapped around it and it just

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.520 
or it wrapped around it and it just
happened<00:04:44.570> to<00:04:44.630> break<00:04:44.840> free<00:04:45.020> because<00:04:45.139> the<00:04:45.350> loop

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
happened to break free because the loop

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.680 
happened to break free because the loop
used<00:04:45.740> to<00:04:45.830> be<00:04:45.980> this<00:04:46.730> big<00:04:47.000> when<00:04:47.210> you<00:04:47.270> set<00:04:47.480> it<00:04:47.570> up

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
used to be this big when you set it up

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.840 
used to be this big when you set it up
so<00:04:48.470> judging<00:04:48.860> by<00:04:48.889> the<00:04:48.980> fact<00:04:49.280> that<00:04:49.370> it<00:04:49.490> was

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
so judging by the fact that it was

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.820 
so judging by the fact that it was
hanging<00:04:50.150> on<00:04:50.240> the<00:04:50.300> tree<00:04:50.540> about<00:04:51.290> that<00:04:51.500> big<00:04:51.710> this

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
hanging on the tree about that big this

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:52.930 
hanging on the tree about that big this
morning<00:04:52.250> leads<00:04:52.430> me<00:04:52.580> to<00:04:52.610> believe<00:04:52.790> that

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
morning leads me to believe that

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.340 
morning leads me to believe that
something<00:04:53.389> came<00:04:53.570> through<00:04:53.600> had<00:04:53.960> tripped<00:04:54.200> it

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
something came through had tripped it

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.800 
something came through had tripped it
and<00:04:54.830> you<00:04:54.950> can<00:04:55.070> also<00:04:55.220> see<00:04:55.610> it<00:04:55.760> evidence<00:04:56.540> down

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
and you can also see it evidence down

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.650 
and you can also see it evidence down
here<00:04:57.580> it<00:04:58.580> didn't<00:04:58.850> like<00:04:58.970> the<00:04:59.090> peppers<00:04:59.419> that<00:04:59.570> we

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
here it didn't like the peppers that we

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.420 
here it didn't like the peppers that we
put<00:04:59.810> out<00:04:59.960> but<00:05:00.260> whatever<00:05:00.560> it<00:05:00.740> was<00:05:00.770> came<00:05:01.220> through

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
put out but whatever it was came through

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.280 
put out but whatever it was came through
we<00:05:01.580> had<00:05:01.730> some<00:05:01.970> bread<00:05:02.180> dog<00:05:02.570> food<00:05:02.840> and<00:05:02.990> some<00:05:03.139> raw

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290 
we had some bread dog food and some raw

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.080 
we had some bread dog food and some raw
chicken<00:05:03.740> on<00:05:03.889> the<00:05:04.130> trigger<00:05:04.370> stick<00:05:04.490> so<00:05:04.910> that's

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
chicken on the trigger stick so that's

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.890 
chicken on the trigger stick so that's
all<00:05:05.240> gone<00:05:05.450> now

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
all gone now

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.280 
all gone now
so<00:05:06.590> whatever<00:05:06.950> it<00:05:07.100> was<00:05:07.280> made<00:05:08.090> a<00:05:08.290> harrowing

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 
so whatever it was made a harrowing

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.010 
so whatever it was made a harrowing
escape<00:05:09.410> and<00:05:10.389> we<00:05:11.389> don't<00:05:11.540> know<00:05:11.600> what<00:05:11.750> it<00:05:11.840> was

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
escape and we don't know what it was

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.070 
escape and we don't know what it was
what<00:05:12.410> it<00:05:12.560> could<00:05:12.680> have<00:05:12.710> been<00:05:12.800> how<00:05:13.160> big<00:05:13.520> it<00:05:13.639> was

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
what it could have been how big it was

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.860 
what it could have been how big it was
but<00:05:15.850> this<00:05:16.850> just<00:05:17.060> kind<00:05:17.270> of<00:05:17.330> emphasizes<00:05:17.780> the

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
but this just kind of emphasizes the

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.720 
but this just kind of emphasizes the
importance<00:05:18.290> of<00:05:18.440> using<00:05:18.620> snare<00:05:19.100> wire<00:05:19.310> because

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
importance of using snare wire because

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.100 
importance of using snare wire because
if<00:05:19.850> a<00:05:20.030> snare<00:05:20.270> wire<00:05:20.450> would<00:05:20.660> have<00:05:20.780> cinched<00:05:21.020> up

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
if a snare wire would have cinched up

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.630 
if a snare wire would have cinched up
really<00:05:21.380> tight<00:05:21.590> and<00:05:21.800> probably<00:05:22.280> wouldn't<00:05:22.490> have

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:22.640 
really tight and probably wouldn't have

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.100 
really tight and probably wouldn't have
let<00:05:22.760> it<00:05:22.790> go<00:05:23.000> and<00:05:23.180> broke<00:05:23.390> a<00:05:23.419> limb<00:05:23.660> or<00:05:23.780> something

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
let it go and broke a limb or something

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.960 
let it go and broke a limb or something
but<00:05:24.290> this<00:05:24.680> is<00:05:24.740> just<00:05:24.950> really<00:05:25.070> cheap<00:05:25.340> nylon<00:05:25.669> cord

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
but this is just really cheap nylon cord

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.030 
but this is just really cheap nylon cord
but<00:05:26.750> as<00:05:26.900> you<00:05:27.020> can<00:05:27.140> see<00:05:27.320> it<00:05:27.590> would<00:05:27.860> work

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
but as you can see it would work

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.250 
but as you can see it would work
typically<00:05:28.880> when<00:05:29.180> you<00:05:29.270> do<00:05:29.390> snares<00:05:29.780> you<00:05:29.870> want<00:05:30.169> to

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
typically when you do snares you want to

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.110 
typically when you do snares you want to
set<00:05:30.410> up<00:05:30.440> like<00:05:30.620> a<00:05:31.070> bunch<00:05:31.550> of<00:05:31.669> them<00:05:31.790> around<00:05:31.970> the

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
set up like a bunch of them around the

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.090 
set up like a bunch of them around the
perimeter<00:05:32.480> of<00:05:32.510> your<00:05:32.720> camp<00:05:32.930> or<00:05:33.080> even<00:05:33.380> off<00:05:33.919> in

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:34.100 
perimeter of your camp or even off in

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.320 
perimeter of your camp or even off in
the<00:05:34.190> woods<00:05:34.370> you<00:05:34.520> want<00:05:34.669> to<00:05:34.729> do<00:05:34.820> more<00:05:35.000> than<00:05:35.120> one

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
the woods you want to do more than one

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.960 
the woods you want to do more than one
because<00:05:35.630> it's<00:05:35.780> a<00:05:35.840> numbers<00:05:36.140> game<00:05:36.200> but<00:05:36.650> yep<00:05:37.640> that

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
because it's a numbers game but yep that

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.150 
because it's a numbers game but yep that
is<00:05:38.000> the<00:05:38.419> primitive<00:05:38.990> snare<00:05:39.470> and<00:05:39.770> this<00:05:40.040> is<00:05:40.130> a

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
is the primitive snare and this is a

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.030 
is the primitive snare and this is a
plane<00:05:40.430> flying<00:05:40.760> overhead
