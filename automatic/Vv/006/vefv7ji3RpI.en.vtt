branches off of that you don't need that
will<00:00:34.879> reduce<00:00:35.540> the<00:00:35.719> drag<00:00:36.140> and<00:00:36.469> allow<00:00:36.860> this

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
will reduce the drag and allow this

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.340 
will reduce the drag and allow this
thing<00:00:37.219> spring<00:00:37.579> up<00:00:37.700> a<00:00:37.790> little<00:00:37.940> faster<00:00:38.350> than

thing spring up a little faster than

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.410 
thing spring up a little faster than
normal<00:00:39.559> and<00:00:41.860> attach<00:00:42.860> your<00:00:43.100> snare<00:00:43.880> will<00:00:44.150> line

normal and attach your snare will line
up<00:00:44.450> to<00:00:44.840> the<00:00:44.960> top<00:00:45.170> of<00:00:45.320> this<00:00:45.410> pole<00:00:46.420> and<00:00:47.420> then<00:00:47.600> you

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
up to the top of this pole and then you

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.280 
up to the top of this pole and then you
attach<00:00:47.840> a<00:00:48.170> toggle<00:00:48.410> right<00:00:48.770> here<00:00:48.980> this<00:00:49.790> is<00:00:50.290> let's

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
attach a toggle right here this is let's

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.800 
attach a toggle right here this is let's
just<00:00:51.530> say<00:00:51.880> just<00:00:52.880> a<00:00:52.940> short<00:00:53.180> stick<00:00:53.450> and<00:00:53.690> you

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:53.810 
just say just a short stick and you

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.500 
just say just a short stick and you
offset<00:00:54.350> where<00:00:54.739> you<00:00:54.890> tie<00:00:55.100> it<00:00:55.160> on<00:00:55.399> or<00:00:56.270> you<00:00:56.329> tie

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
offset where you tie it on or you tie

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.470 
offset where you tie it on or you tie
your<00:00:56.630> line<00:00:56.840> on<00:00:57.020> to<00:00:57.170> the<00:00:57.290> stick<00:00:57.850> because<00:00:58.850> down

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
your line on to the stick because down

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.210 
your line on to the stick because down
here<00:00:59.720> we<00:00:59.840> have<00:00:59.960> Y<00:01:00.170> branching<00:01:00.770> this<00:01:00.950> will<00:01:01.100> go

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220 
here we have Y branching this will go

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.910 
here we have Y branching this will go
underneath<00:01:01.520> that<00:01:01.760> Y<00:01:01.940> branch<00:01:02.270> and<00:01:02.770> then<00:01:03.770> your

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
underneath that Y branch and then your

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.319 
underneath that Y branch and then your
bait<00:01:04.040> stick<00:01:04.280> will<00:01:04.430> go<00:01:04.549> against<00:01:04.970> it<00:01:05.089> and<00:01:05.210> that's

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:05.329 
bait stick will go against it and that's

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:08.350 
bait stick will go against it and that's
what<00:01:05.509> holds<00:01:05.840> your<00:01:06.079> trap<00:01:06.680> and<00:01:07.399> then<00:01:08.060> you<00:01:08.180> come

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
what holds your trap and then you come

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.569 
what holds your trap and then you come
down<00:01:08.540> here<00:01:08.689> with<00:01:08.869> your<00:01:09.049> line<00:01:09.829> I'm<00:01:10.070> using<00:01:10.250> bank

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:10.579 
down here with your line I'm using bank

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:12.850 
down here with your line I'm using bank
line<00:01:10.790> here<00:01:11.090> and<00:01:11.689> you<00:01:11.750> just<00:01:12.170> tie<00:01:12.380> a<00:01:12.409> little<00:01:12.680> loop

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
line here and you just tie a little loop

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:13.240 
line here and you just tie a little loop
in<00:01:13.040> it

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
in it

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.630 
in it
and<00:01:13.900> you<00:01:14.900> want<00:01:15.140> your<00:01:15.290> loop<00:01:15.530> to<00:01:15.830> be<00:01:15.860> about<00:01:16.190> three

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
and you want your loop to be about three

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.719 
and you want your loop to be about three
sizes<00:01:17.500> bigger<00:01:18.500> than<00:01:18.650> your<00:01:19.010> bank<00:01:19.190> line<00:01:19.460> and

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
sizes bigger than your bank line and

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:21.670 
sizes bigger than your bank line and
that<00:01:20.570> gives<00:01:20.840> you<00:01:20.930> just<00:01:21.049> the<00:01:21.170> right<00:01:21.260> amount<00:01:21.380> of

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
that gives you just the right amount of

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.109 
that gives you just the right amount of
speed<00:01:21.920> and<00:01:23.260> enough<00:01:24.260> holding<00:01:24.530> power<00:01:25.060> if<00:01:26.060> you

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
speed and enough holding power if you

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:27.399 
speed and enough holding power if you
make<00:01:26.360> your<00:01:26.540> loop<00:01:26.659> too<00:01:26.869> big

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
make your loop too big

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.330 
make your loop too big
it'll<00:01:28.040> be<00:01:28.159> your<00:01:28.729> snare<00:01:29.570> will<00:01:29.840> be<00:01:30.020> fast<00:01:30.380> but<00:01:31.190> it

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
it'll be your snare will be fast but it

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.590 
it'll be your snare will be fast but it
won't<00:01:31.580> hold<00:01:31.850> as<00:01:32.420> good<00:01:33.970> so<00:01:34.970> to<00:01:35.030> set<00:01:35.270> this<00:01:36.340> you

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
won't hold as good so to set this you

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.840 
won't hold as good so to set this you
bring<00:01:38.600> this<00:01:38.750> down<00:01:39.100> right<00:01:40.100> here<00:01:40.280> to<00:01:40.460> this<00:01:40.610> Y

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
bring this down right here to this Y

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.750 
bring this down right here to this Y
branch

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.610 

alright<00:01:45.760> I'll<00:01:46.120> pound<00:01:46.450> this<00:01:46.810> wah<00:01:47.050> branch<00:01:47.380> in

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
alright I'll pound this wah branch in

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.750 
alright I'll pound this wah branch in
the<00:01:48.100> ground<00:01:48.370> right<00:01:48.550> here<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:51.070> a<00:01:51.400> pound<00:01:51.610> of

then toggle it underneath it and that
wants<00:02:09.340> to<00:02:09.399> pull<00:02:09.610> out<00:02:11.280> put<00:02:12.280> your<00:02:12.430> bait<00:02:12.580> stick<00:02:12.940> in

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
wants to pull out put your bait stick in

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:20.100 
wants to pull out put your bait stick in
there<00:02:16.860> that's<00:02:17.860> what<00:02:18.040> keeps<00:02:18.780> so<00:02:19.780> hold<00:02:20.020> your

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
there that's what keeps so hold your

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:30.030 
there that's what keeps so hold your
trap<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:22.480> then<00:02:22.780> you<00:02:22.900> take<00:02:23.080> your<00:02:23.290> loop<00:02:29.040> let's

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
trap and then you take your loop let's

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.100 
trap and then you take your loop let's
say<00:02:30.220> that<00:02:30.280> every<00:02:30.490> flow<00:02:30.730> in<00:02:30.910> here<00:02:34.110> it's

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
say that every flow in here it's

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.660
