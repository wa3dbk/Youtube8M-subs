00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.080
 plus 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:20.680
 this conference basically for 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:24.070
 those who are interested in the 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:27.340
 music in worship for musicians to 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:30.310
 worshipers or does this conference a 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.829
 interest also in reaching pastors 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.210
 who are not musicians and reach even 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.520
 a general audience 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.219
 that's a question a question that has 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.559
 emerged with some frequency good 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:43.930
 reality is that worship that is very 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.390
 answer of everything that I am to everything 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.880
 what God is is not something exclusive or 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.829
 of musicians or of worship leaders or 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.230
 of worshipers because we are all 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:56.680
 worshipers is an answer that all 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:59.870
 we should give now within what is 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:03.559
 the understanding of that activity 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.510
 and spontaneous act on our part there 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.640
 some that carry out certain 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:11.000
 functions and for this we have some 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.009
 special workshops however many 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.100
 of the other workshops and papers or 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:19.970
 plenaries as we call it, they have 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:23.360
 goal to be able to instruct to give 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:26.240
 greater understanding about what they are 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.490
 response in biblical response to the 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.159
 God's revelation therefore we believe that 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.250
 this is a conference that can animate 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:37.789
 and should encourage and we are at the same time 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:41.030
 inviting for you to encourage all types 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:42.920
 of person who is interested in honoring 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.940
 our God through what 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.580
 we call worship but remember there 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.020
 special workshops for those who 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.119
 they help us 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.280
 to carry out precisely the 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.570
