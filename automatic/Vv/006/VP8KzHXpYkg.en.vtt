00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
game well I think I'm 44 and gay tryst

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.280 
game well I think I'm 44 and gay tryst
hit<00:02:56.910> New<00:02:57.600> Zealand<00:02:58.050> at<00:02:58.170> their<00:02:58.350> best<00:02:58.620> and<00:03:00.290> if

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
hit New Zealand at their best and if

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.260 
hit New Zealand at their best and if
it's<00:03:01.560> not<00:03:01.590> much<00:03:01.860> they<00:03:02.160> can<00:03:02.220> do<00:03:02.489> about<00:03:02.580> it<00:03:02.760> they

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
it's not much they can do about it they

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.820 
it's not much they can do about it they
know<00:03:03.510> they're<00:03:03.900> gonna<00:03:04.020> have<00:03:04.140> to<00:03:04.260> regroup<00:03:04.530> now

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830

and take it on to their next game but

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.790 
and take it on to their next game but
certainly<00:03:06.810> for<00:03:06.959> New<00:03:07.110> Zealand<00:03:07.470> they've<00:03:07.620> set

accomplished type team at certain times
that's<00:03:22.050> certainly<00:03:22.350> not<00:03:22.500> on<00:03:22.650> this<00:03:22.800> occasion

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
that's certainly not on this occasion

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
this tournament but I don't think

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.390 
this tournament but I don't think
they'll<00:03:31.019> have<00:03:31.200> an<00:03:31.320> easier<00:03:31.650> game<00:03:31.890> than<00:03:32.190> that
