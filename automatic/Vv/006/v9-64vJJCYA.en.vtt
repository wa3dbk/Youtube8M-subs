00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430

Boyd<00:01:14.610> both<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:14.970> them<00:01:15.860> to<00:01:16.860> get<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:18.030> small

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
Boyd both of them to get the small

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.010 
Boyd both of them to get the small
medium<00:01:19.680> which<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.220> like<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.759> guess<00:01:21.509> between<00:01:21.750> a

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
medium which is like I guess between a

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.399 
medium which is like I guess between a
size<00:01:22.380> six<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.820> eight<00:01:24.420> if<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.840> know<00:01:25.020> your<00:01:25.200> size

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
size six to eight if you know your size

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.590 
size six to eight if you know your size
because<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:25.890> know<00:01:26.040> I'm<00:01:26.280> like<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.490> seven<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:27.299> I

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
because I know I'm like a seven so I

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.410 
because I know I'm like a seven so I
guess<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.500> would<00:01:29.189> be<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.340> small/medium<00:01:29.880> and

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
guess that would be the small/medium and

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.810 
guess that would be the small/medium and
then<00:01:30.810> everything<00:01:31.079> else<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:32.369> medium/large

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
then everything else is the medium/large

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.600 
then everything else is the medium/large
so<00:01:33.299> if<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.600> want<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:34.079> win<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.680> small/medium<00:01:35.220> a

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
so if you want to win the small/medium a
