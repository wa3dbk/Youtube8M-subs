00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 Hello relatives, it's been a long time since 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.990
 I was uploading a video but here I am back 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.760
 hehe and with a new series of videos to 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.769
 I'll call you good games that the 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.900
 people hate or still do not know what to put 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.969
 hehe if they have an idea for the name 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.369
 please comment the down there well 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.260
 let's start this series of videos it's about 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.820
 of good games that have come out but that 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.590
 people do not like it for many 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.140
 reasons may be because it has changed 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.930
 much the gameplay or the characters or a 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.699
 lots of things well we will start the 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.780
 this series with a game that a lot of people 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:36.420
 I hate when the crash of the titans came out 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.879
 the saga changed the design of the 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.219
 characters the gameplay the design of the 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.110
 game and much more which much 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.199
 people were against this game 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.180
 just look at the drawings in my opinion if 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.489
 they are something ugly haha I do not like the 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.930
 design of coconut or cauca and also 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.360
 the one of the other that I do not remember his name 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.000
 haha but in this I agree if 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.010
 they are ugly xd but that's not why you're going to 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.049
 throw so much shit to the game just 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.120
 because the drawings are ugly do not want 

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:05.280
 say that the game is bad there are many 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.619
 games that his drawings are ugly but they are 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.720
 excellent a great example can be 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.729
 minecraft but for more than the drawings 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.729
 be rare people love it 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.040
 well we already talked a little about the graphs 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.140
 or drawings now let's talk a little bit about the 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.420
 playability or the gameplay the gameplay 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.670
 of the game is a little different from the 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.070
 previous deliveries to start the 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.530
 boxes disappeared normal boxes 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.200
 those that had metal around them 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.660
 which could jump on them in 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.390
 if all the boxes also removed them 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.490
 we no longer picked fruit we picked something 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.440
 called mojo that if they joined me what 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.120
 you had a new movement too 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.190
 we had to pick up by the level 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.380
 Tikachu dolls that were hidden in 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.420
 the levels also something that were like 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.880
 cameras that had three hidden in each 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.250
 level the fruit if it was but they gave us 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.560
 life itself the gameplay changed a lot to 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.660
 of the original games I crush 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.730
 I would say it is a reboot for those who do not 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.860
 know what they mean they are like a game 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.170
 new from a saga that has nothing to 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.240
 see with the previous ones an example is the 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.370
 new devil may cry game that I'll talk about 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.070
 something in another video but this crush is 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.500
 that's a reboot that's why a lot of people say 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.080
 what is bad 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.270
 the game does change a lot in the saga but 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.310
 that's not why it's going to be bad the game is 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.500
 I loved it, I loved it 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.410
 crossed like twice in playstation 2 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.750
 and now I'm playing it in p esp and I 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.150
 loved it but there are always the typical 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.790
 fun voice an example of a fan boy can 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.680
 be the user at home 17 he was the 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.540
 what inspired me to do this video haha 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.700
 I was watching your video games that 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.770
 bored which places a crash of the 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.690
 titans puts it in third place but not 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.150
 gives an argument as to why the game is 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.550
 bored just says the game is bad 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.800
 that the characters have changed a lot the 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.630
 playability et cetera etcetera but not 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.910
 because I was bored and if you are a fan boy 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.100
 they'll fill me with dislike with your multi 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.420
 accounts to me I do not care what 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.670
 I want to get there is that the fanboys 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.500
 criticize the game for being different from the 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.050
 others throw him shit without even 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.209
 try it I know that the game is old and has 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.980
 come out for many consoles but only 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.360
 I want to get there, not because it's different from 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.360
 the others are not going to try 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.969
 to conclude I want to say that the game 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.859
 It is very good and if you do not want to play 

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:26.709
 just because it's different from the others 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:29.170
 crush give it a try and do not be so 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.209
 fan boy give the opportunity to the new 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.250
 games do not say it's bad without 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.409
 I have not even tried it here 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.390
 I recommend that you play it and if you have not 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:39.760
 played I'll look for it haha and if I 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.069
 you want for psp I leave you in the link a 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.200
 tutorial to download it done by me 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.540
 in my other account hahaha good relatives 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.760
 with this concludes the first episode of 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.220
 this saga of videos if you liked it 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.319
 like and if we do not conclude in something bitch 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.450
 for the comments and finally they 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.669
 I mean, give him a chance 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.950
 to the new games since it's never going to 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:02.500
 be the same as it was when you started 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.689
 things change and this game is different 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:09.629
 the previous ones but it's very good 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:09.629
 I recommend 100% good I say goodbye
