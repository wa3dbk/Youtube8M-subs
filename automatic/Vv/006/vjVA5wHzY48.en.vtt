00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.780 

okay<00:02:24.530> i<00:02:24.560> think<00:02:24.680> i<00:02:24.860> glitched<00:02:25.069> it<00:02:25.250> out<00:02:25.340> actually

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
okay i think i glitched it out actually

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.380 
okay i think i glitched it out actually
there<00:02:26.480> we<00:02:26.690> go<00:02:27.069> yeah<00:02:28.069> that<00:02:28.280> in<00:02:28.459> the<00:02:28.670> delays<00:02:29.120> just

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
there we go yeah that in the delays just

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.990 
there we go yeah that in the delays just
forever<00:02:29.720> now<00:02:30.019> so<00:02:30.650> it's<00:02:30.890> not<00:02:30.950> really<00:02:31.280> viable<00:02:31.700> in

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
forever now so it's not really viable in

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.570 
forever now so it's not really viable in
combat<00:02:32.360> anymore<00:02:32.750> I<00:02:33.010> mean<00:02:34.010> it's<00:02:34.129> useful

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
combat anymore I mean it's useful

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.880 
combat anymore I mean it's useful
because<00:02:35.379> rap<00:02:36.379> it's<00:02:36.680> an<00:02:36.830> app<00:02:37.010> gun<00:02:37.670> that<00:02:38.890> doesn't

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
because rap it's an app gun that doesn't

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.940 
because rap it's an app gun that doesn't
hurt<00:02:40.400> itself<00:02:40.760> or<00:02:41.750> an<00:02:41.840> amp<00:02:41.959> she<00:02:42.799> will<00:02:42.890> not<00:02:43.040> go<00:02:44.950> in

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
hurt itself or an amp she will not go in

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.180 
hurt itself or an amp she will not go in
that<00:02:46.540> it's<00:02:47.540> great<00:02:47.780> but<00:02:48.080> it's<00:02:48.140> no<00:02:49.040> longer

that it's great but it's no longer

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.580 
that it's great but it's no longer
useful<00:02:50.000> in<00:02:50.420> the<00:02:50.540> exploit<00:02:50.930> that<00:02:50.959> people<00:02:51.379> use<00:02:51.560> to

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
useful in the exploit that people use to

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.430 
useful in the exploit that people use to
