00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
removable cable but there's a slight

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.640 
removable cable but there's a slight
drawback<00:02:56.819> the<00:02:57.720> tip<00:02:57.989> that<00:02:58.170> goes<00:02:58.349> to<00:02:58.530> the

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
drawback the tip that goes to the

drawback the tip that goes to the
headphones<00:02:59.040> on<00:02:59.250> both<00:02:59.489> it's<00:02:59.790> smaller<00:03:00.269> than<00:03:00.510> the

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
headphones on both it's smaller than the

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.809 
headphones on both it's smaller than the

tip that goes to your device but the

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.509 
tip that goes to your device but the
m50x<00:03:03.420> takes<00:03:03.930> a<00:03:04.049> step<00:03:04.379> further<00:03:04.650> and<00:03:05.010> you<00:03:05.099> have

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
m50x takes a step further and you have

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.670 
m50x takes a step further and you have

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
to use a locking method on the tip you

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.399 
to use a locking method on the tip you
put<00:03:07.889> your<00:03:08.040> headphones<00:03:08.430> in<00:03:09.019> there's<00:03:10.019> a<00:03:10.079> plus

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:27.080 
identical to each other but there's one
difference<00:06:24.779> that<00:06:25.409> is<00:06:25.529> so<00:06:25.800> so<00:06:26.190> tiny<00:06:26.490> that<00:06:26.940> you

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.090 
difference that is so so tiny that you

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.899 
difference that is so so tiny that you
barely<00:06:27.419> notice<00:06:27.840> it<00:06:28.169> the<00:06:28.860> m50x

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:29.909 
barely notice it the m50x

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:33.350 
barely notice it the m50x
has<00:06:30.180> a<00:06:30.389> slightly<00:06:30.840> more<00:06:31.620> surround<00:06:32.219> sound<00:06:32.729> but

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 
has a slightly more surround sound but

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.570 
has a slightly more surround sound but
you<00:06:33.479> actually<00:06:33.750> have<00:06:34.199> to<00:06:34.229> compare<00:06:34.830> them<00:06:35.009> many

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580 
you actually have to compare them many

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.719 
you actually have to compare them many
times<00:06:35.699> to<00:06:36.539> find<00:06:36.810> this<00:06:37.080> difference<00:06:37.649> as<00:06:37.860> far<00:06:38.430> as

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:38.729 
times to find this difference as far as

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:40.730 
times to find this difference as far as
noise<00:06:39.060> isolation<00:06:39.779> goes

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:40.740 
noise isolation goes

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.340 
noise isolation goes
so<00:06:40.860> these<00:06:41.010> do<00:06:41.280> a<00:06:41.310> decent<00:06:41.640> job<00:06:41.940> it<00:06:42.390> isolates

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:43.350 
so these do a decent job it isolates

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.460 
so these do a decent job it isolates
sound<00:06:43.620> very<00:06:44.250> well<00:06:44.700> it's<00:06:45.690> not<00:06:45.870> as<00:06:46.110> much

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:46.470 
sound very well it's not as much

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:47.930 
sound very well it's not as much
isolation<00:06:46.980> you<00:06:47.250> get<00:06:47.460> with<00:06:47.640> the<00:06:47.730> noise

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:47.940 
isolation you get with the noise

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.600 
isolation you get with the noise
cancelling<00:06:48.510> headphones<00:06:48.990> but<00:06:49.500> that's<00:06:49.980> obvious

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:50.610 
cancelling headphones but that's obvious

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.150 
cancelling headphones but that's obvious
there<00:06:51.360> are<00:06:51.450> a<00:06:51.600> lot<00:06:51.930> of<00:06:51.960> similarities<00:06:52.770> between

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:53.160 
there are a lot of similarities between

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.940 
there are a lot of similarities between
these<00:06:53.610> two<00:06:54.110> especially<00:06:55.110> because<00:06:55.710> they<00:06:55.890> are

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:55.950 
these two especially because they are

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.190 
these two especially because they are
the<00:06:56.100> same<00:06:56.370> type<00:06:56.640> of<00:06:56.670> headphones<00:06:57.300> and<00:06:57.450> the<00:06:57.900> same

00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:58.200 
the same type of headphones and the same

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.490 
the same type of headphones and the same
price<00:06:58.620> but<00:06:59.460> I'm<00:06:59.610> still<00:07:00.090> convinced<00:07:00.870> that<00:07:01.020> these

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:01.500 
price but I'm still convinced that these

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.280 
price but I'm still convinced that these
two<00:07:01.800> will<00:07:02.070> have<00:07:02.220> very<00:07:02.610> different<00:07:02.970> buyers<00:07:03.390> the

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:04.290 
two will have very different buyers the

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.440 
two will have very different buyers the
bose<00:07:04.500> soundtrue<00:07:04.800> headphones<00:07:05.150> for<00:07:06.150> the<00:07:06.240> more
