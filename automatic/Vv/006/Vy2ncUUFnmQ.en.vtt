00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.920 
roughly and then we'll
finish<00:02:13.459> em<00:02:13.610> off<00:02:15.069> last<00:02:16.069> one<00:02:16.750> see<00:02:17.750> what<00:02:17.840> I'm

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
finish em off last one see what I'm

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.690 
finish em off last one see what I'm
doing<00:02:18.200> and<00:02:18.319> rolling<00:02:18.650> them<00:02:18.740> into<00:02:19.040> balls<00:02:19.220> first

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
doing and rolling them into balls first

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.050 
doing and rolling them into balls first
and<00:02:20.440> then<00:02:21.440> just<00:02:22.069> flatten<00:02:22.520> them<00:02:22.670> and<00:02:22.880> like<00:02:22.970> I

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
and then just flatten them and like I

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.699 
and then just flatten them and like I
said<00:02:23.120> this<00:02:23.360> will<00:02:23.510> be<00:02:23.630> very<00:02:23.840> sticky<00:02:24.230> because

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
said this will be very sticky because

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.370 
said this will be very sticky because
this<00:02:24.890> is<00:02:25.010> ground<00:02:25.550> turkey<00:02:25.910> breast<00:02:26.260> then<00:02:27.260> you

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
this is ground turkey breast then you

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.650 
this is ground turkey breast then you
make<00:02:27.500> a<00:02:27.530> little<00:02:27.650> indent<00:02:28.250> into<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.700> center<00:02:29.060> so

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
make a little indent into the center so

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.600 
make a little indent into the center so
when<00:02:29.810> they<00:02:29.930> cook<00:02:30.200> they<00:02:30.800> puff<00:02:31.220> up<00:02:31.370> in<00:02:31.520> the

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
when they cook they puff up in the

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.250 
when they cook they puff up in the
middle<00:02:31.880> and<00:02:32.060> they<00:02:32.120> cook<00:02:32.300> evenly<00:02:32.450> instead<00:02:33.140> of

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
middle and they cook evenly instead of

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.440 
middle and they cook evenly instead of
having<00:02:33.440> this<00:02:33.560> big<00:02:33.830> huge<00:02:34.069> puff<00:02:34.370> now<00:02:34.819> mine<00:02:35.150> made

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
having this big huge puff now mine made

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.660 
having this big huge puff now mine made
five<00:02:35.900> big<00:02:36.110> ones<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:36.590> I<00:02:36.620> made<00:02:36.830> two<00:02:37.160> small<00:02:37.459> ones

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
five big ones and I made two small ones

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.420 
five big ones and I made two small ones
but<00:02:37.910> ideally<00:02:38.270> this<00:02:38.660> would<00:02:38.810> make<00:02:39.020> eight

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
but ideally this would make eight

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.190 
but ideally this would make eight
normal-sized<00:02:40.430> burgers<00:02:41.000> but<00:02:41.300> more<00:02:41.780> hungry<00:02:42.080> in

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
normal-sized burgers but more hungry in

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.110 
normal-sized burgers but more hungry in
