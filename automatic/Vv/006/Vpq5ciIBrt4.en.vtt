00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 beauty gal who still talking apathetic 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.930
 and welcome to another video 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.269
 name today let's talk about having there 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.280
 limited to selling players' prices 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.170
 actually like that worked 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.969
 There you want to end up with the stores that 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.980
 they sell fifa coins that you are 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.529
 connected is for example the shop as 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.140
 vital patron is you are there you 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.600
 and you and they buy a 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.820
 player your type any player your 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.710
 there he put an absurd price and 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.779
 You get this to buy a 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.610
 Kiss to buy players is then 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.790
 You make real money yours here. 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.829
 of the real world in fifa coins sell the 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.180
 but any player in the market to 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.059
 stop you could sell any 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.890
 player for any price and there 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.260
 trying to eliminate these stores from 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.950
 mattresses to strengthen the sale of your 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.620
 credit that game 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.960
 They decided to define a price pros 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.789
 players is a price he does not have to 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.430
 to fit the auction time then as 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.559
 is it going to be the stop is you talk to 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.239
 the technician is a very good example for 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.610
 to be difficult but at last is a player 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.530
 bronze there it's worth having a lot 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.049
 market that is saturated I do not know what 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.600
 then it will cost 150 with that to 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.299
 maximum six then how so or you give 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.369
 the minimum bid of 150 with this 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.920
 people struggle until they reach the 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.680
 buy it now in the dear fall 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.200
 hence three of dubai in al that is the 600 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.720
 but do not do what you read then so 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.280
 limiting the sale of players by limiting 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.979
 player selling price 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.900
 there it kills the dog sales market 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.759
 difficult to stop any of this market 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.740
 everybody can drug them goal of 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.049
 Earl playing making single player game 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.270
 to play a multiplayer game or to generate it 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.100
 an endless source and the people the shops 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.979
 sold these guardians for up to a 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.540
 fifa cast price room the same 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.040
 he wants the blue whiting there and maybe 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.250
 that blue cheese for example with 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.500
 ten reais you bought two packages and 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.750
 with the buying with it you with 10 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.909
 I bought type 15 package is on 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.979
 was an absurd difference because the price 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.409
 of the law it up because as it is known 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.079
 there points out a company in this scenario that 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:10.289
 You just want money, of course, then you have 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.750
 this one says regularity in the prisoner in the 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.360
 market of very competitive stores thing 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.730
 competitive 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.520
 between each other and consequently the 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.920
 of these things come out well below what 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.870
 Do you see these days in the market? 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.300
 official buy that son's dream 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.890
 some people defended iii on the 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.800
 surprisingly felt that the market for 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.500
 parallel mergers deregulate the game because 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.540
 some people were feeling 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.370
 encouraged to buy shares whenever 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.680
 people looking for strike by n 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.750
 people bought and made a 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.390
 very strong team for a very 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.910
 low who bought the same fifa coin 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.800
 ends up in the disadvantage of 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.280
 accounts will spend more money to have 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.510
 fewer players then I was 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.150
 deregulating the matches was 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.280
 the teams are uneven so the staff 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.560
 send it right on the internet in 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.350
 trips dragged him from the officially 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.570
 liked the sale of other great lame 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.730
 majority of people in favor of selling 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.560
 dogs for no reason I'm going to talk 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.550
 some of them also because I am the 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.410
 favor 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.480
 first of all when you put 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.820
 selling things through several stores you 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.200
 creates a market behind a game I 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.989
 I particularly find this very 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.690
 generate jobs generates people in 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:25.180
 with expensive income generates so much positive 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.040
 I can not imagine how a 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.200
 common person that a company that already has 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.350
 so much money to their accounts to 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.730
 damaging these stores and being hurtful 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.090
 It's also a competitive market for her. 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.370
 and everything else the sales market is the game 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.230
 them and do what they want but I 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.330
 I am in favor of that when you have a 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.340
 you generate an income whose 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.470
 game was never going to die right then 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.390
 Do you have and ways to make this game? 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.489
 keep acting generate money and you 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.080
 how to let these works continue 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:56.470
 working in my humble opinion 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.330
 although you think them coldly 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.860
 are selling a product that is within 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.540
 I am in favor of this game. 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.950
 trade that exists by people 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.170
 outside the games 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.530
 the person goes there dedicates himself and was a little 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.180
 dog bank and creates an expensive market is 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.430
 fuck because you turn a game of 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:16.060
 football for some people in a market 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.739
 of negotiation form knows and a source 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.010
 of income anyway I think it's always 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.479
 very positive after the players create 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.430
 a market out there is very positive 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:26.360
 for the players is very positive for 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.969
 the game but ikea 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.419
 Poliza sale noise and then they create 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:34.610
 this terrible method of forbidding 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:35.990
 people to sell some fruit from a 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.310
 their work because sometimes the guy 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.229
 stay all day playing fico 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.689
 forming with it it actually succeeds 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:44.150
 make these transactions social banks and 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:46.099
 nor thinking so much of the companies in 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.530
 companies in stores that sell more 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:50.270
 thinking also year player face that 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.669
 the whole day he plays and that he 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.919
 alone achieves a boom in the free 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:56.780
 make this trade correct the then 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:58.639
 I particularly think a lot 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.479
 I'm very interested in this. 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:01.460
 kind of thing 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:03.469
 other thing that leaving the market free 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.849
 fluctuation of the player's price 

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:07.129
 was one of the things that made me 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:09.379
 attracted in the ultimate team face is the fact 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:09.949
 that a letter is coming out in the 

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:11.539
 pec 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:13.460
 many are selling this letter 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:15.439
 officially the dispute between the people 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.680
 will cause the weight of the letter 

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:20.509
 download and the same thing happens a letter 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.860
 it was very rare that few people were selling 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:23.479
 so the guy will put it there 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.610
 the auction is going to have a limit going everybody 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:27.590
 to offer for that letter the letter will have 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.949
 a high value this will create a new 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.990
 average price then this deflation 

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:35.120
 Automatic is natural from the market lets 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.400
 very real expensive thing seems to be 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.839
 really in a negotiation game and 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.659
 this I missed a moment you limit 

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:43.610
 hand will give shit because he has a player 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:44.300
 that the price drops has a player that the price 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.159
 climbs up 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.529
 the market has all this inflation this 

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:50.270
 deflation and and you will have to 

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:51.740
 this will happen and you will have to get the 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.839
 player will talk little look now this 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.680
 player will have to be worth as much either alone 

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:56.449
 they will have to do it 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.240
 constantly making it happen. 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:01.099
 organic form and now it will have to 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.469
 care and officially staff do not 

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:05.629
 trust and thus not trust much 

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:07.699
 the game company to take care of the 

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:09.919
 Her own game, by the way, more bizarre. 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:11.509
 that it is you to think that sometimes 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:13.639
 will have a fucking situation where the master 

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:15.770
 valuation or devaluation and the 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:17.569
 people are going to have to come and then they will have to 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.969
 stop all that sales market and 

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:21.979
 set the price index of it and it already 

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:23.659
 will have player in the auction and will have 

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:25.759
 to play in this auction and will have a player 

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:26.779
 which is going to have a great price a lot 

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:29.900
 different from the other 

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:31.339
 There's going to be a zone, everything's going to go wrong. 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.629
 this update 

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:34.669
 I'm recording this video yet 

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:36.199
 nothing happened other than the company that 

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:37.909
 the market really is defined as 

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:39.440
 will work this way but the 

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:39.680
 son of the community is doing very 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.320
 for 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.539
 a large majority are in favor of prices 

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:47.210
 limited sale of run players 

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:49.190
 on the outside and everything else but learn not 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:51.710
 you can know what the posture of the 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.940
 I am in relation to this the young people I gave 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:55.039
 My opinion I think it has to be 

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:56.210
 released I do not know you guys if you 

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:57.919
 agree with this 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:59.539
 but I think in this excuse of the 

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:02.210
 famous for turning the game into a 

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:03.620
 penguin is quite relative after all 

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:06.229
 we have some elements hand cap 

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:08.120
 that is fact is that it rolls hand cap in fifa and 

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:09.560
 also has the factor that will still have 

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.289
 with it then selling a face that 

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.060
 want to buy with ether foot 

00:07:12.289 --> 00:07:16.220
 it's not like flame is not with her 

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:18.289
 It accompanies that we use but there we have 

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:20.660
 another currency that is but then the green currency 

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:22.550
 nha then is if the guy wants to buy 

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.110
 this green coin he's still going to buy 

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.370
 it will still unbalance the game and 

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.810
 will still have a much stronger team 

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:29.300
 than the Lord why he bought it for 

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:31.009
 of cash so I honestly think that 

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.530
 this excuse of thing default reveals 

00:07:31.009 --> 00:07:35.840
 the market is totally the opposite I 

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:39.110
 I think she stayed to watch over me because she 

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:41.240
 makes the ks trade players very 

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:42.800
 more feasible for all of us the way I want it 

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:44.210
 know your opinion do you think this 

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.990
 You fifa players that 

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:46.789
 accompany 

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:49.070
 leave us comments on this 

00:07:46.789 --> 00:07:51.470
 I am particularly concerned about what I 

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:52.729
 I see that the majority is against this new 

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:54.860
 working method 

00:07:52.729 --> 00:07:56.270
 but finally only seeing to know that deserves 

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:58.340
 the support of all of you who existed until 

00:07:56.270 --> 00:08:00.229
 here is this thank you very much 32 

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:03.970
 here's a hug from the package is 

00:08:00.229 --> 00:08:03.970
 next and thanks
