00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.770
 ae 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:20.560
 the staff touches the rectifier here 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:24.130
 it manufactures the rectifier and looks only 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.020
 interesting is this indicator 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.320
 it has the ability to load the 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:34.260
 battery in 12 standing when people 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:37.989
 places of falcon or cb 450 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:41.109
 Today I can not see the 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:45.550
 their load capacity but that of the stage 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:49.329
 we know it's 77 asks and the battery 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:53.859
 which is in the manual on our bike is 12 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:55.719
 in skins is 12 up to half an hour and second 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:58.569
 test that the sparrow was doing 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:01.359
 our motorcycle consumes 7 hours 

00:00:58.569 --> 00:01:03.549
 then according to him with the tests is 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:08.909
 possible to use a battery of nine 

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:08.909
 hours since consumption is 7 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.670
 so he 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:19.510
 The second test he believed was playing 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:22.690
 with the conclusion that the rectifier 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.310
 it does not do as much on the 91 skin battery 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.340
 so it's all a test question that 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.550
 and it will do more influence 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:36.729
 indicator can only see that it has a 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:39.130
 peculiarity it has here a fuse 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:42.910
 to protect the line 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.470
 in case of any failure to attain the 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.410
 electrical system 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.960
 it is protected akp exclusive of 30 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.960
 near and he already comes here by conectomia 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:57.190
 for those who still have positive connector 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:00.000
 and negative and ps3 here where the 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:03.369
 direct current conversion 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.350
 so I still do not know will stay in 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:10.840
 test knoc land ensures everything but 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.050
 anyway it's the tests that we're going to 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.050
 do 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.880
 ae
