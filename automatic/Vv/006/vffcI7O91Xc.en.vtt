00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.400
 It was very easy and glass that is 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.860
 right here on the sand and put it in the kitchen 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.620
 she the diamond is the hardest part 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.450
 prade up 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.700

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.390
 to have to do here is the school with a 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.960

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:59.700
 iron and iron near the bingo was occurs 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.190
 that an ice pack makes this base is 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.750
 here we will have to do as 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.910
 Empty you click here 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:11.010

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:14.710
 as this here I made the point ba 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:20.619
 little farther than here and there 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:22.990
 point b ready you will have to 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.000
 do the people now to quote 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.659

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.659
 hand 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:34.360
