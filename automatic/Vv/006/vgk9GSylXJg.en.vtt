00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.630 
bring that to continue the same success
what's<00:02:12.970> the<00:02:13.239> the<00:02:13.750> new<00:02:13.870> features<00:02:14.170> or<00:02:14.709> something

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
what's the the new features or something

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.610 
what's the the new features or something
that<00:02:15.819> the<00:02:16.120> Brazilian<00:02:16.510> people<00:02:16.810> maybe<00:02:17.290> can

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
that the Brazilian people maybe can

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.559 
that the Brazilian people maybe can
identify<00:02:17.860> themselves<00:02:18.430> with<00:02:18.790> this

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
identify themselves with this

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.059 
identify themselves with this
I<00:02:20.700> think<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:22.689> root<00:02:22.959> of<00:02:23.140> far<00:02:23.409> cry<00:02:23.439> is<00:02:23.680> to<00:02:23.950> be

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
I think the root of far cry is to be

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.250 
I think the root of far cry is to be
surprising<00:02:24.549> right<00:02:25.060> at<00:02:25.659> the<00:02:25.780> end<00:02:25.930> of<00:02:26.019> far<00:02:26.230> cry

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
surprising right at the end of far cry

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.809 
surprising right at the end of far cry
we<00:02:26.650> wanted<00:02:26.920> to<00:02:26.950> build<00:02:27.129> something<00:02:27.249> that<00:02:27.700> was

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
we wanted to build something that was

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.580

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
different and nobody saw blood dragon

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.890
