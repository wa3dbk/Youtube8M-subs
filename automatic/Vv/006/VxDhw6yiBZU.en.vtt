00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
him his own character I don't think they

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.310 
him his own character I don't think they
should<00:02:02.130> have<00:02:02.310> him<00:02:02.610> as<00:02:02.790> just<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.840> throw<00:02:04.140> in

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
should have him as just to throw in

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.440 
should have him as just to throw in
there<00:02:04.530> like<00:02:04.740> oh<00:02:04.920> here<00:02:05.219> Batman<00:02:05.460> fight<00:02:05.969> fight

to like wanna even destroy sonic run
even<00:03:46.709> more<00:03:47.040> I<00:03:47.280> think<00:03:47.670> that's<00:03:47.820> that<00:03:47.850> we<00:03:48.090> should

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
even more I think that's that we should

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.080 
even more I think that's that we should
do<00:03:48.450> is<00:03:48.720> just<00:03:48.750> have<00:03:49.500> citizens<00:03:50.459> who<00:03:50.579> didn't

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
do is just have citizens who didn't

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.210 
do is just have citizens who didn't
leave<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.329> city<00:03:51.600> in<00:03:51.840> their<00:03:52.079> homes<00:03:52.320> like<00:03:52.620> that

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
leave the city in their homes like that

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.920 
leave the city in their homes like that
is<00:03:53.430> easily<00:03:53.760> gonna<00:03:54.090> I<00:03:54.420> don't<00:03:54.540> know<00:03:54.660> why<00:03:54.780> they

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
is easily gonna I don't know why they

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:55.910 
is easily gonna I don't know why they
don't<00:03:55.019> do<00:03:55.200> something<00:03:55.380> like<00:03:55.500> that<00:03:55.680> and<00:03:55.829> I

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
don't do something like that and I

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:56.690 
don't do something like that and I
really<00:03:56.190> hope<00:03:56.310> they<00:03:56.489> do

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
really hope they do

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.640 
really hope they do
that'll<00:03:57.329> make<00:03:57.420> something<00:03:57.750> different<00:03:57.959> and<00:03:58.320> it

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
that'll make something different and it

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.110 
that'll make something different and it
would<00:03:58.769> add<00:03:59.010> to<00:03:59.040> the<00:03:59.370> effect<00:03:59.489> of<00:03:59.850> everything

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
would add to the effect of everything

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.970 
would add to the effect of everything
being<00:04:00.420> a<00:04:00.510> little<00:04:00.690> bit<00:04:00.780> more<00:04:00.930> real<00:04:01.230> so<00:04:01.680> to<00:04:01.799> recap
