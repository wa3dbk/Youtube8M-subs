00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:32.420 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.490 

first<00:00:33.420> thing<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.660> do<00:00:33.780> is<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:34.020> put<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.320> four

sixth string of the guitar I'm first of

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.810 
sixth string of the guitar I'm first of
all<00:00:45.719> we<00:00:45.870> gonna<00:00:46.079> release<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.100> little<00:00:47.399> finger

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
all we gonna release the little finger

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:55.520 
all we gonna release the little finger
and<00:00:49.610> the<00:00:50.610> ring<00:00:50.640> finger<00:00:52.070> middle<00:00:53.070> finger<00:00:54.530> index

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
and the ring finger middle finger index

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.240 
and the ring finger middle finger index
finger<00:00:56.930> and<00:00:57.930> come<00:00:58.140> back<00:00:58.289> up<00:00:58.559> with<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.890> index

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
finger and come back up with the index

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.950 
finger and come back up with the index
finger

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.799 

so<00:01:02.560> that's<00:01:02.800> the<00:01:02.980> five<00:01:03.220> strokes<00:01:03.730> four<00:01:04.510> down<00:01:04.780> one

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
so that's the five strokes four down one

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.529 
so that's the five strokes four down one
up

00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:10.539 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:15.149 

the<00:01:11.439> important<00:01:11.890> thing<00:01:12.070> is<00:01:13.680> when<00:01:14.680> the<00:01:14.829> index

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
the important thing is when the index

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:16.950 
the important thing is when the index
finger<00:01:15.490> is<00:01:15.520> going<00:01:15.880> down<00:01:16.119> make<00:01:16.450> sure<00:01:16.479> the<00:01:16.810> other

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
finger is going down make sure the other

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.109 
finger is going down make sure the other
fingers<00:01:17.320> come<00:01:17.560> back<00:01:17.770> up<00:01:17.979> in<00:01:18.280> the<00:01:18.610> panda<00:01:18.939> hand

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
fingers come back up in the panda hand

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:21.300 
fingers come back up in the panda hand
ready<00:01:19.479> to<00:01:19.750> start<00:01:20.020> again<00:01:20.350> to<00:01:20.829> do<00:01:20.920> a<00:01:20.979> continuous

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
ready to start again to do a continuous

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.359 
ready to start again to do a continuous
wrong<00:01:21.820> so<00:01:22.240> you<00:01:22.570> want<00:01:23.530> to<00:01:23.649> start<00:01:23.890> I'll<00:01:24.130> do<00:01:24.280> it

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
wrong so you want to start I'll do it

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:30.539 
wrong so you want to start I'll do it
slowly<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.960> thing<00:01:29.140> is<00:01:29.259> a<00:01:29.289> back<00:01:29.560> up<00:01:29.799> before<00:01:30.369> the

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
slowly the thing is a back up before the

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:40.200 
slowly the thing is a back up before the
index<00:01:30.880> finger<00:01:31.149> comes<00:01:31.390> up<00:01:32.579> once<00:01:33.579> again<00:01:39.090> so<00:01:40.090> the

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
index finger comes up once again so the

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:54.749 
index finger comes up once again so the
continuous<00:01:40.479> roll<00:01:40.960> would<00:01:41.289> be<00:01:53.549> it's<00:01:54.549> very

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
continuous roll would be it's very

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:56.639 
continuous roll would be it's very
important<00:01:55.119> to<00:01:55.209> keep<00:01:55.360> the<00:01:55.539> spaces<00:01:56.140> between<00:01:56.170> the

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
important to keep the spaces between the

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.870 
important to keep the spaces between the
strokes<00:01:56.950> very<00:01:57.429> even<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:59.649> lot<00:02:00.280> of<00:02:00.369> my<00:02:00.459> students

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
strokes very even a lot of my students

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.940 
strokes very even a lot of my students
are<00:02:00.970> over<00:02:01.149> the<00:02:01.209> years<00:02:01.360> of<00:02:01.509> a<00:02:01.569> great<00:02:01.950> difficulty

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950

are over the years of a great difficulty
learning<00:02:03.130> this<00:02:03.429> they're<00:02:03.670> not<00:02:03.819> saying<00:02:04.090> it's<00:02:04.239> an

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:04.329 
learning this they're not saying it's an

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:06.660 
learning this they're not saying it's an
easy<00:02:04.479> technique<00:02:04.840> but<00:02:05.709> anyone<00:02:06.159> can<00:02:06.340> play<00:02:06.520> it

that is amazing get into this

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.319 
that is amazing get into this
up-to-speed

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:19.329 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:24.849 

requires<00:02:20.329> a<00:02:20.420> lot<00:02:20.569> of<00:02:20.599> practice<00:02:23.530> you<00:02:24.530> can<00:02:24.590> watch
