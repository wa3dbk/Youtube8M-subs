alright<00:04:04.040> you've<00:04:04.160> got<00:04:04.190> a<00:04:04.310> power<00:04:05.030> adapter<00:04:05.570> and

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.900 

Ethernet<00:04:09.410> and<00:04:09.530> an<00:04:09.650> Ethernet<00:04:09.980> cable<00:04:10.100> alright

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
Ethernet and an Ethernet cable alright

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.070 
Ethernet and an Ethernet cable alright
so<00:04:11.030> the<00:04:11.090> thing<00:04:11.240> about<00:04:11.300> Sonos<00:04:11.750> is<00:04:11.840> you<00:04:11.930> need<00:04:12.050> to

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
so the thing about Sonos is you need to

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.110 
so the thing about Sonos is you need to
have<00:04:12.230> one<00:04:12.530> device<00:04:13.100> so<00:04:13.490> most<00:04:13.670> device<00:04:13.880> on

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
have one device so most device on

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.780 
have one device so most device on
hardwired<00:04:15.020> into<00:04:15.380> your<00:04:15.620> network<00:04:15.860> that's<00:04:16.670> why

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
hardwired into your network that's why

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.220 
hardwired into your network that's why
every<00:04:17.120> service<00:04:17.420> device<00:04:17.660> comes<00:04:17.930> with<00:04:18.020> an

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
every service device comes with an

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.170 
every service device comes with an
Ethernet<00:04:18.590> port<00:04:18.620> so<00:04:19.489> I<00:04:19.549> could<00:04:19.700> plug<00:04:19.790> this<00:04:19.970> into

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
Ethernet port so I could plug this into

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.900 
Ethernet port so I could plug this into
a<00:04:20.299> router<00:04:20.600> and<00:04:20.989> then<00:04:21.410> any<00:04:22.160> other<00:04:22.370> so<00:04:22.760> most

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
a router and then any other so most

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.640 
a router and then any other so most
device<00:04:23.150> that<00:04:23.360> I<00:04:23.390> get<00:04:23.660> would<00:04:23.930> not<00:04:24.170> need<00:04:24.440> to<00:04:24.470> be

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
device that I get would not need to be

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.220 
device that I get would not need to be
plugged<00:04:24.830> in<00:04:25.420> it<00:04:26.420> will<00:04:26.540> just<00:04:26.660> work<00:04:26.780> wirelessly

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
plugged in it will just work wirelessly

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.800 
plugged in it will just work wirelessly
but<00:04:27.440> you<00:04:27.530> do<00:04:27.650> need<00:04:27.830> one<00:04:28.540> cirno's<00:04:29.540> device

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
but you do need one cirno's device

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.230 
but you do need one cirno's device
plugged<00:04:30.200> in<00:04:30.380> hardwired<00:04:30.980> so<00:04:31.700> that<00:04:31.820> everything

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
plugged in hardwired so that everything

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.330 
plugged in hardwired so that everything
else<00:04:32.330> can<00:04:32.420> be<00:04:32.540> wireless<00:04:32.960> but<00:04:33.950> since<00:04:34.100> I<00:04:34.160> do<00:04:34.220> have

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
else can be wireless but since I do have

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.090 
else can be wireless but since I do have
a<00:04:34.520> bunch<00:04:34.820> of<00:04:34.880> so<00:04:35.000> most<00:04:35.150> devices<00:04:35.510> in<00:04:35.600> my<00:04:35.690> home

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
a bunch of so most devices in my home

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.350 
a bunch of so most devices in my home
this<00:04:37.100> can<00:04:37.280> just<00:04:37.340> be<00:04:37.430> plugged<00:04:37.730> right<00:04:37.940> in<00:04:38.150> and

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
this can just be plugged right in and

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.750 
this can just be plugged right in and
used<00:04:39.080> so<00:04:39.650> yeah<00:04:39.710> we've<00:04:39.860> got<00:04:39.980> our<00:04:40.010> AC<00:04:40.280> adapter

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
used so yeah we've got our AC adapter

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.370 
used so yeah we've got our AC adapter
here<00:04:41.000> and<00:04:41.180> our<00:04:41.300> Ethernet<00:04:41.690> port<00:04:41.930> and<00:04:42.080> that's<00:04:42.140> it

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
here and our Ethernet port and that's it

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.990 
here and our Ethernet port and that's it
I<00:04:42.500> would<00:04:42.590> think<00:04:42.770> this<00:04:42.830> thing<00:04:42.980> is<00:04:43.040> Wireless<00:04:43.430> so

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
I would think this thing is Wireless so

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.450 
I would think this thing is Wireless so
the<00:04:44.270> cool<00:04:44.420> thing<00:04:44.570> about<00:04:44.630> the<00:04:44.930> play<00:04:45.200> 3<00:04:45.560> is

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
the cool thing about the play 3 is

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.460 
the cool thing about the play 3 is
there's<00:04:46.640> three<00:04:46.790> speakers<00:04:47.180> in<00:04:47.480> there<00:04:47.630> and<00:04:47.870> if

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
there's three speakers in there and if

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.950 
there's three speakers in there and if
you<00:04:48.560> have<00:04:48.710> it<00:04:48.890> laying<00:04:49.490> down<00:04:49.700> like<00:04:49.910> that<00:04:50.150> it'll

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
you have it laying down like that it'll

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.470 
you have it laying down like that it'll
be<00:04:51.140> a<00:04:51.169> stereo<00:04:51.560> speaker<00:04:52.070> but<00:04:52.520> if<00:04:52.610> you<00:04:52.760> set

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
be a stereo speaker but if you set

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.890 
be a stereo speaker but if you set
up<00:04:53.570> like<00:04:53.750> that<00:04:54.080> and<00:04:55.000> put<00:04:56.000> it<00:04:56.030> upward<00:04:56.360> upright

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
up like that and put it upward upright

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.650 
up like that and put it upward upright
it'll<00:04:57.800> actually<00:04:57.980> use<00:04:58.700> an<00:04:58.850> accelerometer<00:04:59.330> in

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
it'll actually use an accelerometer in

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.390 
it'll actually use an accelerometer in
there<00:04:59.840> and<00:05:00.080> it'll<00:05:00.230> know<00:05:00.470> to<00:05:00.530> make<00:05:00.920> this<00:05:01.040> a<00:05:01.100> mono

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
there and it'll know to make this a mono

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.710 
there and it'll know to make this a mono
speaker<00:05:01.580> so<00:05:02.000> that<00:05:02.120> you're<00:05:02.210> gonna<00:05:02.330> have<00:05:02.450> two<00:05:02.690> of
