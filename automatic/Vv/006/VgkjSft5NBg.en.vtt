00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:19.590
 before applying game had palm 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.210
 moisten my hair so I never 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.300
 stained my hair dry 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.130
 Jacques then clicks on the palm oil 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.660
 starting with the root and I 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.820
 go down to the slopes 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:41.760
 I take this opportunity to untangle my hair 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:43.440
 the hand I put palm oil in 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.180
 insisting well on the tips and in 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.489
 removing the knots at the same time I 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.360
 go back to another section I add 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.469
 palm oil 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:59.129
 I'm sending mails I remove all the nodes 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:02.489
 and then I read the flash fiba in 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:07.430
 from there roots to the ends 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.430
 I end of course making a twist 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.770
 so already first impressions to 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.520
 the application I finally rinse my 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.590
 hands so it's going to be attached op 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:23.790
 orange or red it really goes into 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.560
 just use a little paper like that 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.180
 his share so I still have a little bit left 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.579
 but it only takes a laval date to 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.200
 allocated I think his share by cons 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.369
 I did well to put a lot of 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.700
 stuff around people plastic bags 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.400
 around because his task so happy 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.619
 we count placed township when we put 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.299
 all that in the hair that it can 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.320
 stain the stuff around so I 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.270
 really advise you to put 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.270
 plastic bags all around and avoid 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.920
 to use white it's pretty dry on 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.860
 the hair for now I do not feel 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.659
 still this effect infant etc. 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.450
 but good maybe leaving 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.820
 to rest for an hour I will see 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.409
 once I have reims and once 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.579
 that I will have reims and the oil how is 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:01.969
 what does that actually give on 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.280
 my hair 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:06.320
 so first impression rather low 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.549
 positive I did not notice any big 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.800
 changes in relation to the oil bath 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:12.920
 that I usually just do that 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.959
 it's red it shows his task but 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.519
 but yeah I thought I was waiting 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.310
 it's an oil that we have everywhere 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:21.140
 we in any case Afro Caribbean 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.480
 I know he uses a lot of oil 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.280
 red and it 's always said to have 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.930
 jojoba oil olive oil 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.799
 the excess peyrat and that's why not 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.440
 use red oil 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:31.580
 so I tried and so I'm going to see a 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.780
 time I will have reims is that 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:38.209
 gives on the hair the red oil in 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.829
 any case of positive effects on the 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.349
 sun was getting ready that protects 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:45.049
 sun's sun of the negative effects of 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:47.630
 sun on the hair and that that against the 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.829
 detachment of the hair so it will be 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.519
 maybe a city ​​that I will adopt 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:54.319
 during the summer but for now I'm going 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:57.319
 let it pause for a good 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:01.239
 hour and and reims and all that and I you 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.239
 show the result just after 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.180
 ok so next morning the test with 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.310
 her palm oil red oil 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.190
 palm oil so suddenly bah in 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.500
 done but I can dry you fast enough 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.840
 I must be I'm pretty surprised 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.579
 did that when I woke up this 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.410
 morning I do not know if it's just me 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:24.049
 or if it's actually the oil of 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.609
 palm who did this effect but I 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:27.859
 really felt that in fact my 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:29.959
 hair was much darker kind 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:32.739
 the black color and my hair and bo 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.819
 was much livelier 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:38.220
 so I do not know maybe the hero 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:40.410
 game revives hair colors 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.480
 what did I feel about others 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.040
 much sweeter really very we 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.050
 we really have superb 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.330
 he was super curly when I got them 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:51.690
 that defined the loops actually when 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.220
 I brought him palm oil but 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.890
 loop was really defined I never 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.480
 read my hair like that even in 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:02.360
 using cider vinegar 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:04.740
 but you who was really good people 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:08.990
 pale as a game as say the 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:14.430
 americans of dubbed reminiscences like that 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:18.140
 it was the shell what else ah yes 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:21.239
 positive point so hyper defined loop 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:23.010
 softness in the hair and I 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.110
 believe that it is an axis has an effect 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.970
 also blends on hair because 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.830
 that I honestly but the Vaudois 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.169
 passed between the hair without having to 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:34.230
 use brushes country anything 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:36.570
 either really that's an axis are in 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:40.640
 effect of millions for me anyway 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:43.350
 positive point the softness of the hair 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.380
 remain on the duration in fact so 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.450
 until now it's the day after 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.950
 two worlds - vendhuile with oil of 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.390
 palm so far but now I'm 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.919
 sense always so sweet and they have 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.460
 the air really matured actually they have not 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:56.360
 dry air 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.740
 negative point it is necessary at least 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:02.460
 rinse several several more 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:04.380
 time or that I left in 3-4 age 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:09.450
 I had to use a shampoo 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:11.940
 so really try to tie two 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:15.630
 tags the place you're going to do because 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:19.200
 that down it squirts his job and 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:21.390
 campsas watch out for a garment or on 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.850
 a surface that is pretty clear that 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:27.690
 leaves traces it's in itself that I 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:28.919
 would I do not think that time a 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.050
 once every two months 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:32.729
 to give a little bit of 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.560
 peps to my hair so as I wanted 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:37.110
 said that really delight and the color of 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.760
 my hair and I loved black really 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.310
 shining bright but I wanted 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.130
 really 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.460
 beautiful black lion and it scrolls in 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.710
 loop 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.090
 so here I invite you to try if 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.070
 it's a product you already have the 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.540
 house do not hesitate to try it a 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.690
 like that in a ball you do 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.830
 your own idea of ​​this oil but 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:56.830
 I think my grandmother gave me 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:59.350
 a trick to just avoid that 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:03.070
 the red oil remains red 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:04.450
 so I'm going to ask them and if I 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.800
 find this interesting tip I 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:08.350
 will not hesitate to share it with you 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.250
 so I'm telling you very soon and from here
