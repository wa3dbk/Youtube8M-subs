00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.330
 the next principle of operation is the principle 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.440
 continuation of the movement 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.420
 principle of continuation by movement 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.389
 set so that not 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.750
 stop the movement of the partner and their 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:19.369
 movement keep it moving and 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.630
 look for those necessary two points to 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.560
 partners dump me bring it 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.000
 external level 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:37.200
 let's see the effect on pain 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:45.530
 brush and figurative and go out together there 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:54.649
 which requires continued movement 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:54.649
 no resist no resist 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.789
 partners 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:09.100
 major mistakes in this work 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:12.189
 is that you are many at first 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.259
 you need to turn on the strength and fight to capture 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:17.740
 it is not correct if the partner 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:21.180
 the physical structure of the epam is stronger than me 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.310
 then i lose and seize no spa 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.430
 Therefore, at first in the first start 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:31.110
 don't resist grip 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:48.220
 goes you need to convert it by movement 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:57.280
 with my about moving as i go i go there 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:02:00.600
 where am i where and i will convert it 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.600
 movement with my movement 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.980
 also neck and continued movement and 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:18.120
 continues and can move but with his 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.000
 the next principle is 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.550
 principle of continuity 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.520
 what does this principle mean 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:30.240
 principle says it is necessary 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:36.290
 even you didnâ€™t manage to avoid capture 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:52.350
 so how do you like well for example for capturing 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:56.100
 for your strength do not throw do not push away 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:59.910
 him continue to move on to another 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:02.460
 work that is to another level and to 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.910
 other side impact on partner 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:11.520
 often 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:14.340
 mistakenly if something didn't go from that 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:17.610
 wrong your task is not discarded 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:25.260
 partner and work with him god of the end is not 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:27.570
 went this action didn't go passed on 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:34.130
 dumb so you get 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:37.290
 peculiar smack peculiar smeak 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:40.410
 once again i'm trying to break free of it 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:44.360
 I can't get hold of it 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.630
 actions were obtained but I should not again 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.730
 boulevard with 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:51.930
 or repel around because i can 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:55.470
 get hit i can get myself out of 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.930
 equilibrium so try even if 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:01.250
 you did not succeed liberation law 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.540
 did not work continue 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.780
 keep going that's the essence of it 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:10.530
 the continuity principle I'm constant 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:15.550
 I decided to search where it is possible to work 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:19.239
 where can you knock him down happened not 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:26.200
 gains something to do but fail 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:29.010
 It did not work and I'm looking for where 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:33.460
 You can always work Prince 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:37.360
 it does not work but I 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.680
 constantly work constantly food and on 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.710
 search leads 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.840
 expect 900 that's what's on principle 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.810
 continuity principle 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:50.410
 interrupt them first word 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:52.900
 does not interrupt movement with this 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:57.700
 set of circumstances to move and 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:05:00.550
 look not to break that logical chain 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:03.700
 in which derives his partner 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:07.170
 will enter it mobile and seek 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.170
 work long review
