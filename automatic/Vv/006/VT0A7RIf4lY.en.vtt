00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 on earth a lot of people every 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.960
 week every day 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.940
 they notice strange presences in the 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.820
 sky that could prove the existence 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.610
 of extraterrestrial visitors not 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.760
 However, almost as many people are 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.900
 that belie these observations 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.359
 attributing them to a product of the 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.970
 imagination to a pure lie what 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.029
 allows this division between believers and 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.980
 skeptics is the distance are we so 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.460
 far from what we want to know that nobody 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.530
 you can have a certainty about it 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.719
 so if the question is about the 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.390
 life outside of our planet and the 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.190
 problem is the distance nobody better 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.309
 prepared to respond to that a 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.039
 astronaut experienced in this regard 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.379
 or edwin aldrin member of the mission 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.420
 apollo 11 that took the human for the first 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.969
 once the moon has presented its 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.039
 testimony there was something out there what 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.210
 close enough to be 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.280
 observed and that could be 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.100
 consulted about why not 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.020
 reported that vision at the time 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.360
 Green explained that the three members 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.400
 of the mission they preferred to silence him 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.560
 prevent them from the earth forced them 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.130
 to return they demanded to realize a 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.649
 risky approach on your part edgar 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:23.149
 mitchell astronaut who participated in the 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:25.880
 Apollo 14 mission in 1971 and it was the sixth 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.970
 man on stepping on the moon said that then 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.899
 of traveling in space is 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.110
 completely sure that the 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:35.960
 aliens are watching us I do not know how many 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:39.140
 where or how they do it but they watch us 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.060
 we see these ships at all hours between 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.310
 testimonies that would confirm the 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.990
 existence of extraterrestrial life is 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.450
 account the transcription of a 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.520
 conversation between a researcher of the 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.200
 NASA and the astronauts after the 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.140
 apollo landing 11 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.200
 there the employee of the space agency 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.990
 warns those girls are immense not what 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.720
 they would believe I inform them that there are other ships 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.810
 space out there are on the moon 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.050
 observing us to what neil amstrong 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.959
 the first man to step on lunar soil 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.849
 he replied they warned us to get away 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:16.060
 Some time later the own armstrong 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:19.010
 stated I can not go into details 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.170
 except to say that their ships were 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.560
 far superior to ours both in 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:27.830
 size as in technology were great and 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.650
 threatening despite these testimonies 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.170
 the official version of the nasa denies 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.420
 all close encounter with aliens and 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.330
 their ships there is no version 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.940
 definitive but it is undoubted that if 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.739
 it's about a problem of points of view 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.739
 the astronauts got further
