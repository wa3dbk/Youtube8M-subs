00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
gone over the basic main one of the main

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.990 
gone over the basic main one of the main
guides<00:05:11.540> at<00:05:11.810> this<00:05:11.960> set<00:05:12.230> let's<00:05:12.890> go<00:05:13.130> on<00:05:13.310> to<00:05:13.640> the

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
guides at this set let's go on to the

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.320 
guides at this set let's go on to the
vehicle<00:05:14.770> it<00:05:15.770> really<00:05:16.010> wasn't<00:05:16.340> actually<00:05:17.000> pretty

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
vehicle it really wasn't actually pretty

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.510 
vehicle it really wasn't actually pretty
you<00:05:17.570> know<00:05:17.600> decent<00:05:17.990> size<00:05:18.440> I<00:05:18.860> thought<00:05:19.340> it<00:05:19.430> was

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
you know decent size I thought it was

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.170 
you know decent size I thought it was
going<00:05:19.669> to<00:05:19.730> be<00:05:19.850> smaller<00:05:20.270> and<00:05:20.690> more<00:05:21.380> shaped<00:05:21.800> and

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
going to be smaller and more shaped and

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.440 
going to be smaller and more shaped and
the<00:05:23.180> size<00:05:23.480> of<00:05:23.810> takanuva<00:05:24.530> old<00:05:25.220> vehicle<00:05:25.880> from

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 
the size of takanuva old vehicle from

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.210 
the size of takanuva old vehicle from
when<00:05:26.630> he<00:05:26.720> first<00:05:26.750> ever<00:05:27.169> came<00:05:27.440> out<00:05:27.560> but<00:05:27.740> actually

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
when he first ever came out but actually

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.330 
when he first ever came out but actually
it<00:05:28.580> was<00:05:28.850> quite<00:05:29.030> a<00:05:29.120> bit<00:05:29.360> bigger<00:05:29.919> the<00:05:30.919> UH<00:05:30.950> color

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
it was quite a bit bigger the UH color

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.730 
it was quite a bit bigger the UH color
scheme<00:05:31.730> I<00:05:31.910> enjoyed<00:05:32.720> more<00:05:32.990> when<00:05:33.230> I<00:05:33.260> opened<00:05:33.680> the

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
scheme I enjoyed more when I opened the

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.950 
scheme I enjoyed more when I opened the
set<00:05:33.980> because<00:05:34.310> these<00:05:34.520> colors<00:05:34.850> they've<00:05:35.720> got

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
set because these colors they've got

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.380 
set because these colors they've got
this<00:05:36.140> green<00:05:36.530> was<00:05:37.220> actually<00:05:37.580> kind<00:05:37.820> of<00:05:37.910> cool<00:05:38.180> I

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:38.390 
this green was actually kind of cool I

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:42.040 
this green was actually kind of cool I
enjoyed<00:05:39.050> that<00:05:39.080> it<00:05:39.850> gave<00:05:40.850> a<00:05:40.880> difference<00:05:41.360> to<00:05:41.570> all

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
enjoyed that it gave a difference to all

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:47.680 
enjoyed that it gave a difference to all
the<00:05:42.669> vehicles<00:05:44.800> the<00:05:46.060> shape<00:05:47.060> isn't<00:05:47.570> that

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:47.690 
the vehicles the shape isn't that

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.710 
the vehicles the shape isn't that
different<00:05:47.990> a<00:05:48.290> bit<00:05:48.470> from<00:05:48.740> Rocco<00:05:49.340> I<00:05:49.580> mean<00:05:50.540> it's

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
different a bit from Rocco I mean it's

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.610 
different a bit from Rocco I mean it's
our<00:05:50.900> but<00:05:52.390> we've<00:05:53.390> got<00:05:53.600> some<00:05:53.840> great<00:05:54.050> functions

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
our but we've got some great functions

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.420 
our but we've got some great functions
here<00:05:54.950> you<00:05:55.820> can<00:05:56.240> twist<00:05:57.169> this<00:05:57.560> thing<00:05:57.860> in<00:05:58.340> the

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
here you can twist this thing in the

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:03.340 
here you can twist this thing in the
back<00:05:59.410> to<00:06:00.410> make<00:06:00.650> these<00:06:01.540> like<00:06:02.540> that<00:06:02.810> the

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:03.350 
back to make these like that the

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.159 
back to make these like that the
shootings<00:06:03.860> and<00:06:04.190> then<00:06:05.150> what<00:06:05.690> I'm<00:06:05.780> going<00:06:05.960> to<00:06:06.020> so

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:06.169 
shootings and then what I'm going to so

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:07.900 
shootings and then what I'm going to so
long<00:06:06.410> for<00:06:06.680> to<00:06:06.890> shoot<00:06:07.100> this<00:06:07.280> area<00:06:07.520> sphere<00:06:07.760> what

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:07.910 
long for to shoot this area sphere what

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.060 
long for to shoot this area sphere what
I<00:06:07.940> thought<00:06:08.270> Volta<00:06:08.720> rested<00:06:09.050> but<00:06:09.230> didn't<00:06:09.500> you

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.070 
I thought Volta rested but didn't you

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.400 
I thought Volta rested but didn't you
there's<00:06:10.370> a<00:06:10.430> lever<00:06:10.700> back<00:06:10.970> here<00:06:11.270> you<00:06:11.419> pull<00:06:11.750> and

there's a lever back here you pull and

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:13.780 
there's a lever back here you pull and
it<00:06:12.500> shoots<00:06:12.770> out<00:06:12.950> like<00:06:13.010> that

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:13.790 
it shoots out like that

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:18.070 
it shoots out like that
and<00:06:13.970> it<00:06:14.360> shoots<00:06:14.750> pretty<00:06:15.470> far<00:06:16.720> let's<00:06:17.720> compare

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 
and it shoots pretty far let's compare

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.170 
and it shoots pretty far let's compare
it<00:06:18.140> to<00:06:18.230> some<00:06:18.470> other<00:06:18.500> vehicles<00:06:18.890> being<00:06:19.729> as<00:06:19.970> big

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 
it to some other vehicles being as big

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.550 
it to some other vehicles being as big
as<00:06:20.330> it<00:06:20.479> is<00:06:20.600> we've<00:06:20.810> always<00:06:21.020> got<00:06:21.320> bigger

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:21.560
