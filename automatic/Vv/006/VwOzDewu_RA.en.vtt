so<00:00:06.359> now<00:00:06.540> I've<00:00:06.750> been<00:00:06.779> having<00:00:07.350> said<00:00:07.649> the<00:00:07.799> fewer

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
so now I've been having said the fewer

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.220 
so now I've been having said the fewer

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
information about the exterior to guide

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.709 
information about the exterior to guide
you<00:00:10.469> through<00:00:10.769> this<00:00:10.950> this<00:00:11.460> goal<00:00:11.759> of<00:00:11.969> making<00:00:12.450> a

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
you through this this goal of making a

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.939 
you through this this goal of making a
tea<00:00:13.019> tea<00:00:13.230> and<00:00:13.440> making<00:00:13.799> a<00:00:13.889> sports<00:00:14.219> car<00:00:14.660> the<00:00:15.949> the

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
tea tea and making a sports car the the

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.390 
tea tea and making a sports car the the
second<00:00:17.520> goal<00:00:17.910> making<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.570> sports<00:00:18.900> car<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:19.289> very

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
second goal making a sports car is very

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.269 
second goal making a sports car is very
important<00:00:20.400> in<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.670> interior<00:00:21.270> so<00:00:22.160> very<00:00:23.160> early

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
important in the interior so very early

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.849 
important in the interior so very early
in<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.730> redesign<00:00:24.210> process<00:00:24.480> we<00:00:24.930> said<00:00:25.170> we<00:00:25.619> need

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
in the redesign process we said we need

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.189 
in the redesign process we said we need
to<00:00:26.070> make<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.310> very<00:00:26.580> legitimate<00:00:27.090> sports<00:00:27.960> car

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
to make a very legitimate sports car

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.439 
to make a very legitimate sports car
interior<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.250> therefore<00:00:29.849> we<00:00:30.090> try<00:00:30.390> to

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
interior and and therefore we try to

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.920 
interior and and therefore we try to
minimize<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.920> reduce<00:00:32.279> all<00:00:33.239> possible

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
minimize and reduce all possible

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.010 
minimize and reduce all possible
distraction<00:00:35.149> information<00:00:36.149> flow<00:00:36.450> from<00:00:36.870> the

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
distraction information flow from the

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.610 
distraction information flow from the
driver<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.790> do<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.480> machine<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:40.050> could

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
driver to do to the machine that could

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.459 
driver to do to the machine that could
eventually<00:00:41.340> distract<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.719> driver<00:00:43.020> from<00:00:43.379> his

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
eventually distract the driver from his

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.160 
eventually distract the driver from his
eyes<00:00:43.829> from<00:00:44.610> following<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.210> road<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.960> means

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
eyes from following the road that means

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.319 
eyes from following the road that means
we<00:00:46.680> took<00:00:46.890> all<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.430> information<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:48.270> we

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
we took all the information and we

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.779 
we took all the information and we
brought<00:00:48.960> all<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.770> information<00:00:50.399> in<00:00:50.610> the

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
brought all the information in the

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.119 
brought all the information in the
fields<00:00:51.149> of<00:00:51.239> veil<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.629> vision<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.620> drive<00:00:52.890> as

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
fields of veil of vision of the drive as

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.700 
fields of veil of vision of the drive as
close<00:00:53.489> as<00:00:53.730> possible<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:54.510> where<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.379> eye<00:00:55.410> at

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
close as possible that where the eye at

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.920 
close as possible that where the eye at
where<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.070> eyes<00:00:56.219> are<00:00:56.520> following<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:57.090> road<00:00:57.270> so

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
where the eyes are following the road so

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.959 
where the eyes are following the road so
this<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.649> very<00:00:58.920> important<00:00:59.550> point<00:00:59.730> and

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
this is a very important point and

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.819 
this is a very important point and
obviously<00:01:00.120> it's<00:01:00.690> changing<00:01:01.199> radically<00:01:01.469> the

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
obviously it's changing radically the

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.039 
obviously it's changing radically the
architecture<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.670> this<00:01:02.940> information<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.809> this

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
architecture of this information of this

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.690 
architecture of this information of this
interior<00:01:04.470> there's<00:01:05.369> no<00:01:06.860> removable<00:01:07.860> screen<00:01:08.280> in

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
interior there's no removable screen in

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.609 
interior there's no removable screen in
the<00:01:08.820> middle<00:01:08.970> everything<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.049> here

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
the middle everything is here

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.450 
the middle everything is here
so<00:01:11.340> this<00:01:11.880> was<00:01:12.180> allowing<00:01:12.750> us<00:01:12.960> as<00:01:13.200> in<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:13.979> design

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
so this was allowing us as in the design

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.359 
so this was allowing us as in the design
team<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:15.000> create<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.869> very<00:01:16.350> new<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:16.770> fresh<00:01:17.310> in

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
team to create a very new and fresh in

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.570 
team to create a very new and fresh in
Tyrion<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:19.170> aspect<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.770> reduction<00:01:20.430> and

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
Tyrion in the aspect of reduction and

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.630 
Tyrion in the aspect of reduction and
lightweight<00:01:21.030> design<00:01:21.240> was<00:01:22.020> taking<00:01:22.530> place<00:01:22.710> very

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
lightweight design was taking place very

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.520 
lightweight design was taking place very
very<00:01:24.119> strongly<00:01:25.110> in<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.650> interior<00:01:27.530> the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
very strongly in the interior the

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.420 
very strongly in the interior the
dashboard<00:01:29.159> is<00:01:30.140> influenced<00:01:31.140> from<00:01:31.710> an<00:01:32.040> airplane

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
dashboard is influenced from an airplane

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.240 
dashboard is influenced from an airplane
wing<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.180> if<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:34.049> section<00:01:34.470> is<00:01:34.619> also<00:01:35.009> very

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
wing and if the section is also very

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.080 
wing and if the section is also very
lightweight<00:01:35.780> there<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:37.140> events<00:01:37.740> are

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
lightweight there the events are

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.469 
lightweight there the events are
inspired<00:01:39.090> from<00:01:39.270> turbines<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:41.009> they've

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
inspired from turbines and and they've

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.560 
inspired from turbines and and they've
perfectly<00:01:42.479> integrated<00:01:43.280> if<00:01:44.280> we<00:01:44.850> start<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.420> and

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
perfectly integrated if we start the and

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:52.340 
perfectly integrated if we start the and
activate<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.320> car<00:01:46.939> you<00:01:47.939> will<00:01:48.149> see<00:01:51.170> you<00:01:52.170> will

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
activate the car you will see you will

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.429 
activate the car you will see you will
see<00:01:52.590> now<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:54.210> old<00:01:54.479> climate<00:01:54.960> control

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
see now that the the old climate control

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.410 
see now that the the old climate control
are<00:01:55.880> integrated<00:01:56.880> in<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.149> vents<00:01:58.310> how<00:01:59.420> our

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
are integrated in the vents how our

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.359 
are integrated in the vents how our
clothes<00:02:00.810> are<00:02:01.079> all<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.530> opened<00:02:01.979> there<00:02:02.159> the

clothes are all I opened there the

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.530 
clothes are all I opened there the
system<00:02:02.579> now<00:02:03.060> here<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:04.049> have<00:02:04.399> the<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.759> flow

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
system now here you have the the flow

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
system now here you have the the flow
direction<00:02:07.409> that<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.770> want<00:02:08.009> or<00:02:08.729> defrost<00:02:09.450> or

here<00:02:17.400> you<00:02:17.700> control<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.720> temperature<00:02:20.120> like

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
here you control the temperature like

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.810 
here you control the temperature like
this<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:22.230> here<00:02:22.560> you<00:02:22.680> can't<00:02:22.920> look<00:02:23.070> at<00:02:23.280> the

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
this and here you can't look at the

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.270 
this and here you can't look at the
velocity<00:02:24.180> of<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.780> air<00:02:24.890> which<00:02:25.890> is<00:02:26.070> very

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
velocity of the air which is very

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.670 
velocity of the air which is very
interesting<00:02:26.610> because<00:02:26.910> where<00:02:27.540> you<00:02:27.750> touch<00:02:28.020> you

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
interesting because where you touch you

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.620 
interesting because where you touch you
feel<00:02:28.980> what's<00:02:29.190> happening<00:02:29.670> at<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.240> tip<00:02:30.420> of<00:02:30.570> your

spoke<00:04:05.880> to<00:04:06.170> reinforce<00:04:07.170> the<00:04:07.380> fact<00:04:07.560> that<00:04:07.709> we

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
spoke to reinforce the fact that we

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.870 
spoke to reinforce the fact that we
wanted<00:04:08.250> to<00:04:08.400> create<00:04:08.700> a<00:04:08.730> lightweight<00:04:09.060> design

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.440 

mm<00:04:12.690> I<00:04:12.840> touch<00:04:13.170> is<00:04:13.380> also<00:04:14.070> part<00:04:14.340> of<00:04:14.520> this<00:04:14.700> car<00:04:15.030> so

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
mm I touch is also part of this car so

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.979 
mm I touch is also part of this car so
you<00:04:15.510> can<00:04:15.990> give<00:04:16.230> commando<00:04:17.239> for<00:04:18.239> example<00:04:18.690> if<00:04:18.840> we

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
you can give commando for example if we

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.940 
you can give commando for example if we
go<00:04:19.020> to<00:04:19.310> telephone<00:04:20.310> or<00:04:20.640> in<00:04:20.970> our<00:04:21.330> navigation

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
go to telephone or in our navigation

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.510 
go to telephone or in our navigation
then<00:04:22.950> you<00:04:23.340> can<00:04:23.720> describe<00:04:25.070> letters<00:04:26.070> as<00:04:26.340> you

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
then you can describe letters as you

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.300 
then you can describe letters as you
want<00:04:26.790> so<00:04:27.240> it<00:04:28.230> which<00:04:28.470> is<00:04:28.680> very<00:04:28.980> interesting

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
want so it which is very interesting

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.200 
want so it which is very interesting
because<00:04:29.730> you<00:04:30.000> can<00:04:30.390> describe<00:04:30.810> a<00:04:31.230> b<00:04:31.680> or<00:04:31.980> a<00:04:32.340> with

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
because you can describe a b or a with

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.360 
because you can describe a b or a with
your<00:04:33.420> fingers<00:04:33.810> without<00:04:34.290> looking<00:04:34.740> at<00:04:34.890> this<00:04:35.100> I

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
your fingers without looking at this I

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.360 
your fingers without looking at this I
mean<00:04:35.400> in<00:04:35.760> intuitive<00:04:36.480> you<00:04:36.930> can<00:04:37.140> keep<00:04:37.530> your<00:04:37.860> your
