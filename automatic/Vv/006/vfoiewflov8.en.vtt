announced and with that we don't know
whether<00:01:43.829> this<00:01:44.040> is<00:01:44.100> going<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.549> be<00:01:44.670> an<00:01:44.759> entirely

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
whether this is going to be an entirely

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.149 
whether this is going to be an entirely
original<00:01:45.450> plot<00:01:46.259> or<00:01:46.590> if<00:01:46.680> it's<00:01:46.799> gonna<00:01:46.920> follow

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
original plot or if it's gonna follow

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.800 
original plot or if it's gonna follow
one<00:01:47.399> of<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.640> game<00:01:47.880> definitely<00:01:48.509> they<00:01:48.630> could

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
one of the game definitely they could

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.030 
one of the game definitely they could
follow<00:01:48.990> maybe<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.439> plot<00:01:49.649> of<00:01:49.680> twilight

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
follow maybe the plot of twilight

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.000 
follow maybe the plot of twilight
princess<00:01:50.220> or<00:01:50.610> some<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.820> the

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
princess or some of the

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.800 
princess or some of the
other<00:01:51.130> games<00:01:51.250> but<00:01:51.790> I'm<00:01:51.970> more<00:01:52.300> inclined<00:01:52.450> to

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
other games but I'm more inclined to

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.090 
other games but I'm more inclined to
think<00:01:52.840> that<00:01:53.110> this<00:01:53.260> will<00:01:53.440> probably<00:01:53.680> be<00:01:53.860> an

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
think that this will probably be an

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.860 
think that this will probably be an
original<00:01:54.580> series<00:01:54.940> it's<00:01:55.180> going<00:01:55.540> to<00:01:55.600> keep<00:01:55.720> the

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:55.870 
original series it's going to keep the

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.780 
original series it's going to keep the
audience<00:01:55.990> on<00:01:56.350> their<00:01:56.500> toes<00:01:56.710> Zelda<00:01:57.340> fans<00:01:57.490> are

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
audience on their toes Zelda fans are

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:58.920 
audience on their toes Zelda fans are
definitely<00:01:57.970> going<00:01:58.330> to<00:01:58.420> tune<00:01:58.600> in<00:01:58.750> because

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
definitely going to tune in because

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.540 
definitely going to tune in because
they're<00:01:59.320> not<00:01:59.470> going<00:01:59.650> to<00:01:59.710> know<00:01:59.800> what<00:01:59.950> to<00:02:00.010> expect

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
they're not going to know what to expect

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.370 
they're not going to know what to expect
I<00:02:00.790> think<00:02:01.300> that's<00:02:01.480> just<00:02:01.570> the<00:02:01.810> best<00:02:01.960> way<00:02:02.140> to<00:02:02.200> go

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
I think that's just the best way to go

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.650 
I think that's just the best way to go
about<00:02:02.410> it<00:02:02.680> and<00:02:03.010> heck<00:02:03.520> this<00:02:03.880> is<00:02:03.940> another<00:02:04.330> link

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
about it and heck this is another link

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:05.940 
about it and heck this is another link
and<00:02:04.900> zelda<00:02:05.050> that<00:02:05.320> we<00:02:05.410> could<00:02:05.530> add<00:02:05.650> to<00:02:05.830> our

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
and zelda that we could add to our

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.860 
and zelda that we could add to our
timeline<00:02:06.490> for<00:02:06.940> casting<00:02:07.360> we<00:02:07.510> don't<00:02:07.720> know
