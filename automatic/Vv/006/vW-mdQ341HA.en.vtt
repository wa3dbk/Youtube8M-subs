alright<00:00:03.090> alright<00:00:03.360> so<00:00:03.780> I'd<00:00:03.870> done<00:00:04.080> a<00:00:04.110> little

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
alright alright so I'd done a little

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.390 
alright alright so I'd done a little
more<00:00:04.470> work<00:00:04.830> here<00:00:05.240> this<00:00:06.240> is<00:00:06.450> a<00:00:06.950> form<00:00:07.950> of<00:00:08.099> warm

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
more work here this is a form of warm

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.700 
more work here this is a form of warm
white<00:00:08.639> LED<00:00:08.809> but<00:00:09.809> as<00:00:10.019> you<00:00:10.170> can<00:00:10.320> see<00:00:10.530> it's

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
white LED but as you can see it's

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.799 
white LED but as you can see it's
distinctly<00:00:11.309> green<00:00:11.700> so<00:00:11.969> it<00:00:12.000> gives<00:00:12.210> more<00:00:12.509> of<00:00:12.660> a

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
distinctly green so it gives more of a

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.749 
distinctly green so it gives more of a
fluorescent<00:00:13.500> lighting<00:00:13.710> kind<00:00:14.070> of<00:00:14.160> effect<00:00:14.490> I

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
fluorescent lighting kind of effect I

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.500 
fluorescent lighting kind of effect I
think<00:00:15.480> this<00:00:15.599> is<00:00:15.660> pretty<00:00:15.960> much<00:00:17.060> pretty<00:00:18.060> good

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
think this is pretty much pretty good

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.480 
think this is pretty much pretty good
for<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:18.930> color<00:00:19.140> that<00:00:19.380> should<00:00:19.619> go<00:00:19.770> there<00:00:20.039> may

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
for the color that should go there may

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.330 
for the color that should go there may
be<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.730> bit<00:00:21.000> of<00:00:21.180> yellow<00:00:21.359> as<00:00:21.720> well<00:00:22.619> but<00:00:23.070> I'm

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
be a bit of yellow as well but I'm

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.150 
be a bit of yellow as well but I'm
definitely<00:00:23.970> liking<00:00:24.420> that<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.050> over<00:00:25.260> here<00:00:25.529> you

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
definitely liking that and over here you

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.880 
definitely liking that and over here you
can<00:00:26.279> see<00:00:26.430> I've<00:00:26.550> got<00:00:26.580> these<00:00:27.240> are<00:00:27.390> actually

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
can see I've got these are actually

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.030 
can see I've got these are actually
amber<00:00:28.890> LEDs<00:00:29.580> as<00:00:29.880> opposed<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.449> orange<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.170> I

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
amber LEDs as opposed to orange and I

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.709 
amber LEDs as opposed to orange and I
want<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.550> effect<00:00:32.880> here<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.329> be<00:00:33.480> the

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
want the effect here to be the

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.600 
want the effect here to be the
downstairs<00:00:34.530> looked<00:00:34.770> pretty<00:00:35.010> orange-ish

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
downstairs looked pretty orange-ish

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.280 
downstairs looked pretty orange-ish
yellow<00:00:35.670> overall<00:00:36.390> could<00:00:36.719> have<00:00:36.809> been<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.050> film

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
yellow overall could have been the film

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.380 
yellow overall could have been the film
stock<00:00:37.620> but<00:00:37.920> I'd<00:00:38.040> like<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.309> retain<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:39.120> kind

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
stock but I'd like to retain that kind

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.569 
stock but I'd like to retain that kind
of<00:00:39.480> effect<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:40.530> I'm<00:00:40.620> probably<00:00:40.739> going<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.100> add<00:00:41.250> a

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
of effect so I'm probably going to add a

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.650 
of effect so I'm probably going to add a
warm<00:00:42.360> white<00:00:42.629> LED<00:00:42.899> in<00:00:43.829> here<00:00:44.190> too<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:45.059> maybe

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
warm white LED in here too and maybe

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.540 
warm white LED in here too and maybe
ramp<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.260> orange<00:00:46.559> back<00:00:46.800> little<00:00:47.280> that's<00:00:47.430> a

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
ramp the orange back little that's a

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.600 
ramp the orange back little that's a
little<00:00:47.850> strong<00:00:48.149> right<00:00:48.480> now<00:00:49.010> and<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.250> elevator

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
little strong right now and the elevator

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.760 
little strong right now and the elevator
is<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.879> little<00:00:51.239> bright<00:00:51.449> too<00:00:51.750> but<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.410> can<00:00:52.620> work

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
is a little bright too but it can work

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.119 
is a little bright too but it can work
on<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:53.340> over<00:00:54.210> here<00:00:54.770> I'm<00:00:55.770> going<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.010> be

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
on that over here I'm going to be

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.779 
on that over here I'm going to be
putting<00:00:56.399> one<00:00:57.360> blue<00:00:57.840> for<00:00:58.230> every<00:00:58.530> two<00:00:58.829> regular

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
putting one blue for every two regular

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.330 
putting one blue for every two regular
white<00:01:00.059> LEDs<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.629> are<00:01:01.020> in<00:01:01.140> here<00:01:01.350> so<00:01:01.739> I<00:01:01.770> figured

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
white LEDs that are in here so I figured

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.780 
white LEDs that are in here so I figured
I'll<00:01:02.489> record<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.300> process<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.489> maybe<00:01:05.489> show

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
I'll record that process and maybe show

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.080 
I'll record that process and maybe show
you<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:06.000> trick<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.840> used<00:01:07.110> for<00:01:07.850> using<00:01:08.850> so

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
you a trick that I used for using so

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.500 
you a trick that I used for using so
little<00:01:09.420> wire<00:01:09.600> on<00:01:09.930> these<00:01:10.200> here<00:01:11.150> then<00:01:12.150> over<00:01:12.420> in

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
little wire on these here then over in

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.289 
little wire on these here then over in
the<00:01:12.600> center<00:01:12.900> I've<00:01:13.020> got<00:01:13.260> an<00:01:13.409> RGB<00:01:13.799> flasher<00:01:14.520> the

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
the center I've got an RGB flasher the

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.219 
the center I've got an RGB flasher the
initial<00:01:15.990> idea<00:01:16.530> for<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.400> was<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.150> have<00:01:18.330> one

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
initial idea for that was to have one

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.730 
initial idea for that was to have one
slow<00:01:20.040> RGB<00:01:20.670> flasher<00:01:21.270> behind<00:01:21.720> every<00:01:22.080> door<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:22.619> it

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
slow RGB flasher behind every door so it

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.260 
slow RGB flasher behind every door so it
looked<00:01:22.950> like<00:01:23.070> there's<00:01:23.310> just<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.820> little<00:01:24.060> bit<00:01:24.180> of

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
looked like there's just a little bit of

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.760 
looked like there's just a little bit of
life<00:01:24.450> going<00:01:24.840> on<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:27.080> I'm<00:01:28.080> definitely<00:01:28.439> not

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
life going on and I'm definitely not

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.100 
life going on and I'm definitely not
going<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.159> be<00:01:29.280> able<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.579> get<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.880> camera<00:01:30.360> too

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
going to be able to get the camera too

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.249 
going to be able to get the camera too
close<00:01:32.299> let's<00:01:33.299> try<00:01:33.630> this<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:35.869> little<00:01:36.869> better<00:01:37.049> but

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
close let's try this a little better but

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.249 
close let's try this a little better but
not<00:01:37.320> much<00:01:38.090> so<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.210> course<00:01:39.270> these<00:01:39.689> side<00:01:39.960> walls

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
not much so of course these side walls

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.899 
not much so of course these side walls
here<00:01:40.530> would<00:01:40.710> be<00:01:40.740> blocked<00:01:41.159> off<00:01:41.460> once<00:01:41.790> the

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
here would be blocked off once the

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.130 
here would be blocked off once the
landing<00:01:42.420> gear<00:01:42.630> Wells<00:01:43.380> go<00:01:43.740> in<00:01:43.979> but<00:01:44.939> uh<00:01:45.020> once<00:01:46.020> i

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
landing gear Wells go in but uh once i

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.749 
landing gear Wells go in but uh once i
actually<00:01:46.320> started<00:01:46.860> looking<00:01:47.340> around<00:01:47.430> the

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
actually started looking around the

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.999 
actually started looking around the
inside<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.509> window<00:01:48.840> here<00:01:49.110> there's

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
inside of the window here there's

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.990 
inside of the window here there's
actually<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.490> lot<00:01:50.579> going<00:01:51.149> on<00:01:51.560> there's<00:01:52.560> a

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
actually a lot going on there's a

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.030 
actually a lot going on there's a
details<00:01:54.000> on<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.450> roof<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:54.990> can<00:01:55.290> be<00:01:55.409> seen<00:01:55.619> of

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
details on the roof that can be seen of

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.010 
details on the roof that can be seen of
course<00:01:56.399> it's<00:01:56.610> easier<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.240> see<00:01:57.390> all<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.659> stuff

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
course it's easier to see all that stuff

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.090 
course it's easier to see all that stuff
over<00:01:58.619> here<00:01:59.090> but<00:02:00.090> uh<00:02:00.560> yeah<00:02:01.560> i'm<00:02:01.710> thinking<00:02:02.009> about

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
over here but uh yeah i'm thinking about

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.730 
over here but uh yeah i'm thinking about
throwing<00:02:02.460> some<00:02:02.790> like<00:02:02.969> pipes<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.689> boxes<00:02:04.439> and

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
throwing some like pipes and boxes and

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.410 
throwing some like pipes and boxes and
stuff<00:02:05.130> back<00:02:05.369> there<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.850> make<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.240> little

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
stuff back there to make it a little

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.760 
stuff back there to make it a little
more<00:02:07.489> active<00:02:08.489> basically<00:02:09.200> and<00:02:10.200> i<00:02:10.319> know<00:02:10.440> there's

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
more active basically and i know there's

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.860 
more active basically and i know there's
not<00:02:11.190> supposed<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.730> be<00:02:11.790> that<00:02:11.910> stuff<00:02:12.360> down<00:02:12.599> there

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
not supposed to be that stuff down there

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.400 
not supposed to be that stuff down there
and<00:02:13.020> those<00:02:13.170> probably<00:02:13.680> sealed<00:02:13.950> off

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
and those probably sealed off

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.980 
and those probably sealed off
air<00:02:14.620> locks<00:02:14.980> but<00:02:15.400> I<00:02:15.970> think<00:02:16.510> it'll<00:02:16.660> be<00:02:16.780> a<00:02:16.810> nice

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
air locks but I think it'll be a nice

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.050 
air locks but I think it'll be a nice
little<00:02:17.200> touch<00:02:17.500> there<00:02:18.460> will<00:02:18.640> be<00:02:18.670> some

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
little touch there will be some

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.390 
little touch there will be some
reflection<00:02:19.660> from<00:02:19.840> the<00:02:19.930> LED<00:02:20.470> coming<00:02:20.890> out<00:02:21.010> onto

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
reflection from the LED coming out onto

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.300 
reflection from the LED coming out onto
the<00:02:21.520> under<00:02:22.240> board<00:02:22.480> here<00:02:22.840> it's<00:02:23.620> not<00:02:23.770> showing<00:02:24.100> up

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
the under board here it's not showing up

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.640 
the under board here it's not showing up
too<00:02:24.550> well<00:02:24.730> on<00:02:24.760> camera<00:02:25.240> but<00:02:25.630> it<00:02:25.810> is<00:02:25.960> distinct<00:02:26.560> in

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
too well on camera but it is distinct in

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.130 
too well on camera but it is distinct in
person<00:02:27.390> but<00:02:28.390> there's<00:02:28.600> a<00:02:28.660> lot<00:02:28.780> of<00:02:28.810> stuff<00:02:29.110> that

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
person but there's a lot of stuff that

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.290 
person but there's a lot of stuff that
can<00:02:29.440> go<00:02:29.590> on<00:02:29.620> under<00:02:29.920> here<00:02:30.190> I<00:02:30.250> think<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:30.760> here's

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
can go on under here I think and here's

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.810 
can go on under here I think and here's
how<00:02:31.570> the<00:02:31.630> underside<00:02:32.260> of<00:02:32.290> this<00:02:32.800> look<00:02:33.130> so<00:02:33.430> I<00:02:33.490> put

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
how the underside of this look so I put

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.390 
how the underside of this look so I put
extra<00:02:34.030> strips<00:02:34.690> and<00:02:35.050> tubes<00:02:35.620> and<00:02:35.920> stuff<00:02:36.010> there

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
extra strips and tubes and stuff there

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.340 
extra strips and tubes and stuff there
so<00:02:36.580> I'm<00:02:37.270> just<00:02:37.480> thinking<00:02:37.750> a<00:02:37.840> couple<00:02:38.140> things

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
so I'm just thinking a couple things

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.200 
so I'm just thinking a couple things
hanging<00:02:38.620> down<00:02:38.920> from<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.250> ceiling<00:02:39.340> like<00:02:40.060> I

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
hanging down from the ceiling like I

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.170 
hanging down from the ceiling like I
said<00:02:40.420> like<00:02:40.450> just<00:02:41.320> get<00:02:41.440> a<00:02:41.470> brass<00:02:41.710> rod<00:02:42.040> half<00:02:42.970> an

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
said like just get a brass rod half an

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.750 
said like just get a brass rod half an
inch<00:02:43.330> or<00:02:43.480> so<00:02:43.690> if<00:02:43.960> that<00:02:44.230> just<00:02:44.920> to<00:02:45.130> glue<00:02:45.520> it<00:02:45.550> to

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
inch or so if that just to glue it to

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.570 
inch or so if that just to glue it to
the<00:02:45.790> ceiling<00:02:45.880> and<00:02:46.420> have<00:02:46.840> it<00:02:47.050> a<00:02:47.260> fallen<00:02:48.070> or

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
the ceiling and have it a fallen or

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.870 
the ceiling and have it a fallen or
rather<00:02:49.320> not<00:02:50.320> fall<00:02:50.620> into<00:02:50.800> the<00:02:51.040> room<00:02:51.190> but<00:02:51.460> fall

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
rather not fall into the room but fall

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.290 
rather not fall into the room but fall
into<00:02:52.210> the<00:02:52.330> room<00:02:52.740> so<00:02:53.740> right<00:02:54.310> now<00:02:54.340> like<00:02:55.150> I<00:02:55.270> said

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
into the room so right now like I said

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.930 
into the room so right now like I said
the<00:02:55.630> initial<00:02:55.990> idea<00:02:56.290> was<00:02:56.380> to<00:02:56.620> have<00:02:56.650> one<00:02:57.190> RGB

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
the initial idea was to have one RGB

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.470 
the initial idea was to have one RGB
behind<00:02:58.480> each<00:02:58.780> window<00:02:59.140> and<00:03:00.180> basically<00:03:01.180> what

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
behind each window and basically what

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:09.420 
behind each window and basically what
that<00:03:01.540> looked<00:03:01.960> like<00:03:02.160> was<00:03:03.570> this<00:03:08.070> so<00:03:09.070> now<00:03:09.190> right

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
that looked like was this so now right

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.730 
that looked like was this so now right
up<00:03:09.610> against<00:03:10.060> there<00:03:10.270> I<00:03:12.450> put<00:03:13.450> a<00:03:13.480> distinct<00:03:14.110> light

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
up against there I put a distinct light

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.260 
up against there I put a distinct light
on<00:03:14.980> the<00:03:15.340> upper<00:03:16.090> ceiling<00:03:16.480> there<00:03:17.640> and<00:03:18.640> of<00:03:19.180> course

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
on the upper ceiling there and of course

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.110 
on the upper ceiling there and of course
that<00:03:19.690> door<00:03:19.900> would<00:03:20.110> have<00:03:20.260> to<00:03:20.410> be<00:03:20.530> painted<00:03:21.120> fully

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
that door would have to be painted fully

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.570 
that door would have to be painted fully
black<00:03:22.450> to<00:03:22.870> stop<00:03:23.380> that<00:03:23.620> light<00:03:23.950> from<00:03:24.220> leaking

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
black to stop that light from leaking

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.530 
black to stop that light from leaking
through<00:03:26.340> but<00:03:27.340> overall<00:03:27.610> there's<00:03:27.940> not<00:03:28.120> a<00:03:28.150> lot

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
through but overall there's not a lot

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.320 
through but overall there's not a lot
effect<00:03:28.930> on<00:03:29.200> the<00:03:29.500> stuff<00:03:29.800> behind<00:03:30.130> it<00:03:30.610> all<00:03:30.790> so

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
effect on the stuff behind it all so

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.449 
effect on the stuff behind it all so
having<00:03:31.810> one<00:03:32.140> RGB<00:03:32.650> in<00:03:32.800> the<00:03:32.920> center<00:03:33.250> and<00:03:33.340> i'll

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
having one RGB in the center and i'll

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.970 
having one RGB in the center and i'll
probably<00:03:33.670> put<00:03:34.000> maybe<00:03:34.780> a<00:03:34.959> couple<00:03:35.230> yellows<00:03:35.650> and

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
probably put maybe a couple yellows and

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.420 
probably put maybe a couple yellows and
warm<00:03:36.790> white<00:03:37.060> I<00:03:37.860> don't<00:03:38.860> know<00:03:38.950> about<00:03:39.100> the

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
warm white I don't know about the

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.430 
warm white I don't know about the
fluorescent<00:03:40.120> light<00:03:40.270> is<00:03:40.540> what<00:03:40.840> I'll<00:03:40.959> refer<00:03:41.290> to

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
fluorescent light is what I'll refer to

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.250 
fluorescent light is what I'll refer to
that<00:03:41.590> kind<00:03:41.860> as<00:03:42.160> right<00:03:42.459> there<00:03:43.020> you<00:03:44.020> definitely

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
that kind as right there you definitely

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.210 
that kind as right there you definitely
see<00:03:44.620> there's<00:03:44.860> a<00:03:44.950> rat's<00:03:45.489> nest<00:03:45.790> going<00:03:46.239> on<00:03:46.390> here

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
see there's a rat's nest going on here

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.560 
see there's a rat's nest going on here
let's<00:03:48.220> get<00:03:48.400> some<00:03:48.610> light<00:03:48.790> going<00:03:49.030> on<00:03:51.300> so<00:03:52.300> now

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
let's get some light going on so now

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.390 
let's get some light going on so now
that<00:03:52.720> I've<00:03:52.840> got<00:03:53.050> those<00:03:53.260> LEDs<00:03:53.709> positioned<00:03:54.280> I

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
that I've got those LEDs positioned I

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.340 
that I've got those LEDs positioned I
can<00:03:54.580> trim<00:03:54.820> those<00:03:55.060> wires<00:03:55.390> down<00:03:55.750> really<00:03:56.050> nice

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
can trim those wires down really nice

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
can trim those wires down really nice
and<00:03:56.560> neat<00:03:56.770> and<00:03:56.980> clean<00:03:57.910> all<00:03:58.060> out<00:03:58.450> up<00:03:58.830> this<00:03:59.830> RGB

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
and neat and clean all out up this RGB

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.520 
and neat and clean all out up this RGB
flasher<00:04:00.910> is<00:04:01.060> just<00:04:01.270> hanging<00:04:01.690> out<00:04:02.100> over<00:04:03.100> here

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
flasher is just hanging out over here

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.460 
flasher is just hanging out over here
let's<00:04:05.530> get<00:04:05.770> on<00:04:05.950> to<00:04:06.250> the<00:04:06.580> blue<00:04:06.850> LEDs<00:04:07.300> I'm<00:04:07.660> going

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
let's get on to the blue LEDs I'm going

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.010 
let's get on to the blue LEDs I'm going
to<00:04:08.560> shave<00:04:08.739> these<00:04:08.980> down<00:04:09.280> the<00:04:09.940> tips<00:04:10.450> off<00:04:10.660> just

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
to shave these down the tips off just

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.090 
to shave these down the tips off just
like<00:04:11.110> I<00:04:11.350> did<00:04:11.410> on<00:04:11.590> the<00:04:11.860> other<00:04:11.890> ones<00:04:12.220> there<00:04:12.690> and

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
like I did on the other ones there and

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.190 
like I did on the other ones there and
I'm<00:04:15.100> probably<00:04:15.459> going<00:04:15.700> to<00:04:15.820> go<00:04:16.090> with<00:04:16.299> like<00:04:16.510> 5k

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
I'm probably going to go with like 5k

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.710 
I'm probably going to go with like 5k
resistors<00:04:17.770> on<00:04:17.950> these<00:04:18.160> off<00:04:18.430> the<00:04:18.609> bat<00:04:18.820> just

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
resistors on these off the bat just

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.440 
resistors on these off the bat just
because<00:04:20.020> I<00:04:20.049> only<00:04:20.380> want<00:04:20.770> them<00:04:21.010> to<00:04:21.549> I<00:04:21.580> want<00:04:22.300> it<00:04:22.419> to

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
because I only want them to I want it to

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.719 
because I only want them to I want it to
be<00:04:22.570> really<00:04:22.870> subtle<00:04:23.200> maybe<00:04:24.130> should<00:04:24.400> just<00:04:24.610> go

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
be really subtle maybe should just go

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.370 
be really subtle maybe should just go
with<00:04:24.910> tues<00:04:25.180> and<00:04:25.419> then<00:04:25.510> ramp<00:04:25.780> them<00:04:25.960> down<00:04:26.140> off

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
with tues and then ramp them down off

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.150 
with tues and then ramp them down off
the<00:04:26.560> master<00:04:26.979> I<00:04:27.010> guess<00:04:27.280> that<00:04:27.520> would<00:04:27.640> make<00:04:27.700> more

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
the master I guess that would make more

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.970 
the master I guess that would make more
since<00:04:28.370> you<00:04:28.610> can<00:04:28.760> pile<00:04:29.000> on<00:04:29.110> you<00:04:30.110> know<00:04:30.200> five<00:04:30.620> tues

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
since you can pile on you know five tues

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:37.270 
since you can pile on you know five tues
ten<00:04:31.490> fives<00:04:31.850> and<00:04:33.070> get<00:04:34.070> a<00:04:34.100> lot<00:04:34.460> of<00:04:36.070> dimming<00:04:37.070> on

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
ten fives and get a lot of dimming on

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
ten fives and get a lot of dimming on
the<00:04:37.760> LEDs<00:04:38.360> going<00:04:38.840> on<00:04:39.020> I<00:04:39.430> gotta<00:04:40.430> pull<00:04:40.700> that<00:04:40.910> led

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
the LEDs going on I gotta pull that led

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.710 
the LEDs going on I gotta pull that led
out<00:04:41.630> of<00:04:41.810> there<00:04:41.990> and<00:04:43.180> that<00:04:44.180> won't<00:04:44.420> be<00:04:44.600> a<00:04:44.630> problem

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
out of there and that won't be a problem

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.840 
out of there and that won't be a problem
at<00:04:45.200> all<00:04:45.320> i'm<00:04:45.500> going<00:04:45.650> to<00:04:45.710> leave<00:04:45.830> these<00:04:46.040> wires<00:04:46.400> in

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
at all i'm going to leave these wires in

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.810 
at all i'm going to leave these wires in
like<00:04:47.330> this<00:04:47.510> one<00:04:47.720> is<00:04:47.870> already<00:04:48.080> loosened<00:04:48.590> up<00:04:48.820> i'm

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
like this one is already loosened up i'm

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.730 
like this one is already loosened up i'm
just<00:04:49.970> going<00:04:50.120> to<00:04:50.180> leave<00:04:50.390> this<00:04:50.630> just<00:04:51.050> snip<00:04:51.320> it<00:04:51.500> so

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
just going to leave this just snip it so

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.040 
just going to leave this just snip it so
that<00:04:52.010> nothing<00:04:52.670> is<00:04:52.760> exposed<00:04:53.210> or<00:04:53.480> maybe<00:04:53.660> glue<00:04:53.930> it

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
that nothing is exposed or maybe glue it

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.380 
that nothing is exposed or maybe glue it
down<00:04:54.080> to<00:04:54.470> the<00:04:54.590> surface<00:04:54.770> so<00:04:55.220> there's<00:04:56.210> no<00:04:56.360> chance

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
down to the surface so there's no chance

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.470 
down to the surface so there's no chance
of<00:04:56.810> it<00:04:56.930> ever<00:04:57.080> doing<00:04:57.320> anything<00:04:58.150> and<00:04:59.150> then<00:04:59.330> this

00:04:59.470 --> 00:04:59.480 
of it ever doing anything and then this

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.420 
of it ever doing anything and then this
one<00:04:59.540> just<00:04:59.930> has<00:05:00.140> to<00:05:00.320> be<00:05:00.380> snipped<00:05:00.890> out<00:05:01.070> of<00:05:01.250> there

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
one just has to be snipped out of there

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.770 
one just has to be snipped out of there
and<00:05:01.870> that<00:05:02.870> should<00:05:03.110> be<00:05:03.230> good<00:05:03.440> as<00:05:03.650> is<00:05:04.630> so<00:05:05.630> i'll

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
and that should be good as is so i'll

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.060 
and that should be good as is so i'll
definitely<00:05:06.290> tape<00:05:07.210> the<00:05:08.210> blue<00:05:09.140> going<00:05:09.560> on<00:05:09.710> here

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
definitely tape the blue going on here

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.180 
definitely tape the blue going on here
and<00:05:10.390> all<00:05:11.390> that<00:05:11.660> will<00:05:11.840> be<00:05:11.870> wired<00:05:12.200> along<00:05:12.620> over<00:05:12.980> to

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
and all that will be wired along over to

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:19.230 
and all that will be wired along over to
this<00:05:13.340> area<00:05:16.120> definitely<00:05:17.120> get<00:05:17.210> a<00:05:17.240> few<00:05:17.990> more

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
this area definitely get a few more

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.820 
this area definitely get a few more
colored<00:05:20.240> LEDs<00:05:20.720> in<00:05:20.990> here<00:05:21.230> like<00:05:21.440> i<00:05:21.590> said<00:05:21.800> a

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
colored LEDs in here like i said a

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.450 
colored LEDs in here like i said a
couple<00:05:22.100> yellows<00:05:22.580> a<00:05:23.020> couple<00:05:24.020> warm<00:05:24.740> whites<00:05:25.040> and

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
couple yellows a couple warm whites and

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.260 
couple yellows a couple warm whites and
a<00:05:26.120> couple<00:05:26.390> flashers<00:05:26.990> just<00:05:27.410> to<00:05:27.850> give<00:05:28.850> things<00:05:29.090> a

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
a couple flashers just to give things a

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.640 
a couple flashers just to give things a
little<00:05:29.420> difference<00:05:30.250> so<00:05:31.810> this<00:05:32.810> is<00:05:32.840> a<00:05:33.320> fusion

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
little difference so this is a fusion

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.470 
little difference so this is a fusion
core<00:05:33.980> cover<00:05:34.190> that<00:05:34.730> started<00:05:35.300> off<00:05:35.450> just

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:35.480 
core cover that started off just

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.400 
core cover that started off just
basically<00:05:36.170> as<00:05:36.440> the<00:05:37.180> circle<00:05:38.180> to<00:05:38.420> block<00:05:38.900> the<00:05:39.170> top

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
basically as the circle to block the top

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.830 
basically as the circle to block the top
off<00:05:39.650> here<00:05:39.980> and<00:05:40.130> I<00:05:41.060> have<00:05:41.240> these<00:05:41.420> one<00:05:41.690> inch

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
off here and I have these one inch

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.540 
off here and I have these one inch
strips<00:05:42.200> laying<00:05:42.500> around<00:05:42.770> so<00:05:42.980> I<00:05:43.040> figured<00:05:43.430> well

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
strips laying around so I figured well

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.150 
strips laying around so I figured well
why<00:05:44.120> not<00:05:44.150> take<00:05:44.510> a<00:05:44.570> look<00:05:44.810> at<00:05:44.900> them<00:05:45.080> and<00:05:45.380> see<00:05:45.919> if<00:05:45.950> I

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 
why not take a look at them and see if I

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.590 
why not take a look at them and see if I
could<00:05:46.220> make<00:05:46.550> walls<00:05:46.820> going<00:05:47.240> all<00:05:47.390> the<00:05:47.510> way

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 
could make walls going all the way

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.620 
could make walls going all the way
around<00:05:47.750> because<00:05:48.740> it<00:05:49.340> was<00:05:49.669> almost<00:05:49.970> guaranteed

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
around because it was almost guaranteed

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:54.010 
around because it was almost guaranteed
to<00:05:50.660> be<00:05:50.960> light<00:05:51.410> bouncing<00:05:51.919> around<00:05:52.540> from<00:05:53.540> one<00:05:53.780> way

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 
to be light bouncing around from one way

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.830 
to be light bouncing around from one way
or<00:05:54.230> another<00:05:54.260> I<00:05:55.030> thought<00:05:56.030> this<00:05:56.210> would<00:05:56.390> fit<00:05:56.690> in

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
or another I thought this would fit in

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.690 
or another I thought this would fit in
any<00:05:57.080> which<00:05:57.290> way<00:05:57.350> but<00:05:57.560> I<00:05:58.070> guess<00:05:59.890> I<00:06:00.890> should<00:06:01.640> have

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:01.700 
any which way but I guess I should have

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.010 
any which way but I guess I should have
paid<00:06:01.850> attention<00:06:01.880> in<00:06:02.360> which<00:06:02.510> way<00:06:02.690> I<00:06:02.720> pulled

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
paid attention in which way I pulled

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.600 
paid attention in which way I pulled
this<00:06:03.140> off<00:06:04.419> there<00:06:05.419> we<00:06:05.540> go<00:06:06.100> so<00:06:07.100> I'll<00:06:07.370> have<00:06:07.550> to

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610 
this off there we go so I'll have to

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.790 
this off there we go so I'll have to
mark<00:06:07.910> that<00:06:08.090> then<00:06:08.390> this<00:06:08.930> way<00:06:09.140> goes<00:06:09.380> that<00:06:09.650> way

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:09.800 
mark that then this way goes that way

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.840 
mark that then this way goes that way
flight<00:06:10.190> deck<00:06:12.190> but<00:06:13.190> this<00:06:13.340> was<00:06:13.490> simple<00:06:13.820> enough

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:13.850 
flight deck but this was simple enough

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:16.690 
flight deck but this was simple enough
to<00:06:14.150> build<00:06:14.330> all<00:06:14.750> I<00:06:14.810> did<00:06:14.990> was<00:06:15.169> pop<00:06:15.650> out<00:06:15.890> the<00:06:15.919> outer

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:16.700 
to build all I did was pop out the outer

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.030 
to build all I did was pop out the outer
fusion<00:06:17.210> core<00:06:17.390> area<00:06:17.750> circle<00:06:18.230> add<00:06:18.350> onto<00:06:18.560> a<00:06:18.770> piece

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:19.040 
fusion core area circle add onto a piece

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.280 
fusion core area circle add onto a piece
of<00:06:19.070> styrene<00:06:19.520> trim<00:06:20.090> that<00:06:20.300> and<00:06:20.600> then<00:06:20.720> I<00:06:20.840> realized

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:21.290 
of styrene trim that and then I realized

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:24.159 
of styrene trim that and then I realized
that<00:06:21.500> where<00:06:22.400> it<00:06:22.550> hits<00:06:22.760> these<00:06:23.000> legs<00:06:23.480> i<00:06:23.780> needed<00:06:24.080> a

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:24.169 
that where it hits these legs i needed a

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:26.620 
that where it hits these legs i needed a
flat<00:06:24.470> place<00:06:24.740> going<00:06:25.040> across<00:06:25.340> to<00:06:25.700> get<00:06:26.270> it<00:06:26.390> to<00:06:26.510> fit

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:26.630 
flat place going across to get it to fit

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.190 
flat place going across to get it to fit
better<00:06:26.870> and<00:06:27.200> then<00:06:28.040> the<00:06:28.820> styrene<00:06:29.450> strips<00:06:29.930> here

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:30.200 
better and then the styrene strips here

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.530 
better and then the styrene strips here
they<00:06:31.010> are<00:06:31.160> just<00:06:31.340> scrapped<00:06:31.730> laying<00:06:32.000> around<00:06:32.330> i

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:32.540 
they are just scrapped laying around i

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.870 
they are just scrapped laying around i
went<00:06:32.750> with<00:06:32.840> the<00:06:33.050> superglue<00:06:33.650> and<00:06:33.919> see<00:06:34.190> a<00:06:34.220> combo

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 
went with the superglue and see a combo

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.100 
went with the superglue and see a combo
to<00:06:35.150> beat<00:06:35.630> those<00:06:35.840> up<00:06:36.080> real<00:06:36.320> fast

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.110 
to beat those up real fast

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.620 
to beat those up real fast
and<00:06:37.620> once<00:06:38.160> this<00:06:38.280> gets<00:06:38.490> painted<00:06:38.820> black<00:06:39.210> it's

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:39.630 
and once this gets painted black it's

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.240 
and once this gets painted black it's
going<00:06:39.870> to<00:06:39.930> be<00:06:40.080> really<00:06:40.380> good<00:06:40.650> at<00:06:40.770> blocking<00:06:40.920> all

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.250 
going to be really good at blocking all

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:45.230 
going to be really good at blocking all
the<00:06:41.400> light<00:06:42.020> so<00:06:43.020> uh<00:06:43.580> yeah<00:06:44.580> I<00:06:44.610> guess<00:06:44.820> that's

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.240 
the light so uh yeah I guess that's

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.730 
the light so uh yeah I guess that's
pretty<00:06:45.450> much<00:06:45.660> it<00:06:45.720> that's<00:06:46.140> definitely<00:06:46.590> a<00:06:46.710> good

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:46.740 
pretty much it that's definitely a good

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.580 
pretty much it that's definitely a good
one<00:06:47.040> to<00:06:47.220> have<00:06:47.370> here<00:06:48.170> doesn't<00:06:49.170> get<00:06:49.320> in<00:06:49.440> the<00:06:49.470> way

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:49.590 
one to have here doesn't get in the way

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:51.710 
one to have here doesn't get in the way
as<00:06:49.980> demonstrated<00:06:50.820> by<00:06:50.850> putting<00:06:51.300> a<00:06:51.390> floor<00:06:51.660> on

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 
as demonstrated by putting a floor on

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:58.160 
as demonstrated by putting a floor on
and<00:06:54.830> one<00:06:55.830> thing<00:06:56.070> that<00:06:56.100> there<00:06:56.820> is<00:06:57.030> some<00:06:57.810> blocker

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:58.170 
and one thing that there is some blocker

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.100 
and one thing that there is some blocker
somewhere<00:06:58.890> trying<00:06:59.850> to<00:07:00.000> think<00:07:00.210> now<00:07:00.420> one<00:07:00.990> of

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:01.110 
somewhere trying to think now one of

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:02.930 
somewhere trying to think now one of
these<00:07:01.230> struts<00:07:01.590> actually<00:07:02.130> interferes<00:07:02.670> with

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:02.940 
these struts actually interferes with

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.590 
these struts actually interferes with
the<00:07:03.180> LEDs<00:07:04.400> see<00:07:05.400> if<00:07:05.550> I<00:07:05.670> can<00:07:05.880> find<00:07:06.090> that<00:07:06.360> real

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:06.600 
the LEDs see if I can find that real

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:12.530 
the LEDs see if I can find that real
quick<00:07:07.910> all<00:07:08.910> right<00:07:08.970> it<00:07:09.660> was<00:07:10.880> these<00:07:11.880> three<00:07:12.240> tubes

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:12.540 
quick all right it was these three tubes

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.920 
quick all right it was these three tubes
and<00:07:13.460> that<00:07:14.460> wall<00:07:14.760> there<00:07:14.790> were<00:07:15.390> hitting<00:07:15.780> each

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:15.930 
and that wall there were hitting each

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:18.230 
and that wall there were hitting each
other<00:07:16.190> it<00:07:17.190> shouldn't<00:07:17.580> be<00:07:17.670> a<00:07:17.700> problem<00:07:18.030> though

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 
other it shouldn't be a problem though

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.080 
other it shouldn't be a problem though
at<00:07:19.110> worst<00:07:19.380> i'll<00:07:20.160> have<00:07:20.340> to<00:07:20.460> cut<00:07:20.640> a<00:07:20.670> little<00:07:20.850> bit

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:21.090 
at worst i'll have to cut a little bit

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:23.630 
at worst i'll have to cut a little bit
around<00:07:21.330> the<00:07:21.540> styrene<00:07:22.200> wall<00:07:22.560> to<00:07:22.830> get<00:07:23.220> him<00:07:23.310> fit

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:23.640 
around the styrene wall to get him fit

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.600 
around the styrene wall to get him fit
better<00:07:23.850> and<00:07:24.380> there's<00:07:25.380> the<00:07:25.650> blue<00:07:25.950> LED<00:07:26.370> I<00:07:26.400> was

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:26.610 
better and there's the blue LED I was

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:35.150 
better and there's the blue LED I was
looking<00:07:26.910> for<00:07:32.150> that's<00:07:33.150> it<00:07:33.360> for<00:07:33.950> the<00:07:34.950> main

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:35.160 
looking for that's it for the main

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:39.740 
looking for that's it for the main
talking<00:07:35.550> stuff<00:07:36.090> I<00:07:36.270> guess<00:07:37.910> so<00:07:38.910> now<00:07:39.330> what<00:07:39.630> I'll

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:39.750 
talking stuff I guess so now what I'll

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:43.310 
talking stuff I guess so now what I'll
do<00:07:39.990> is<00:07:40.400> set<00:07:41.400> up<00:07:41.430> the<00:07:41.700> camera<00:07:42.150> and<00:07:42.390> start<00:07:43.110> wiring

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:43.320 
do is set up the camera and start wiring

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:47.240 
do is set up the camera and start wiring
those<00:07:43.830> LEDs<00:07:44.490> into<00:07:44.910> the<00:07:45.030> mix
