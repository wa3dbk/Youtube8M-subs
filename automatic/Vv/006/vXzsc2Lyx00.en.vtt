instead<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:06.930> drawing<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.290> one<00:01:07.549> a<00:01:08.549> piece<00:01:09.030> is

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
instead of drawing you one a piece is

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.359 
instead of drawing you one a piece is
usually<00:01:09.810> more<00:01:09.990> complicated<00:01:10.740> as<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:10.979> know

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
usually more complicated as you know

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.429 
usually more complicated as you know
then<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.390> throw-up<00:01:12.840> or<00:01:13.200> just<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:14.010> tag<00:01:14.220> obviously

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
then a throw-up or just a tag obviously

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:18.080 
then a throw-up or just a tag obviously
so<00:01:16.439> you're<00:01:17.040> going<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.250> start<00:01:17.520> want<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.880> start

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
so you're going to start want to start

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.490 
so you're going to start want to start

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
maybe draw the sea without this

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.710 
maybe draw the sea without this
extension<00:01:24.450> piece<00:01:24.780> here<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:26.009> are<00:01:26.360> without<00:01:27.360> any

I<00:01:34.799> made<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.130> small<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.430> simple<00:01:35.729> like<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.590> in

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
I made it small and simple like that in

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.679 
I made it small and simple like that in
a<00:01:37.740> normal<00:01:37.890> scenario<00:01:38.250> I'll<00:01:38.880> show<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.540> piece

a normal scenario I'll show you a piece

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.149 
a normal scenario I'll show you a piece
later<00:01:39.960> on<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.909> this<00:01:41.909> U<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.270> normal<00:01:42.659> size<00:01:43.159> the

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
later on that this U is normal size the

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.520 
later on that this U is normal size the
D<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:45.060> just<00:01:45.119> started<00:01:45.540> off<00:01:45.689> as<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.899> simple<00:01:46.170> D

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
D is just started off as a simple D

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.649 
D is just started off as a simple D
still<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:47.189> it's<00:01:47.399> not<00:01:47.549> even<00:01:47.820> this<00:01:48.149> isn't<00:01:48.360> really

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
still is it's not even this isn't really

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.770 
still is it's not even this isn't really
wild<00:01:48.990> style<00:01:49.500> this<00:01:49.710> is<00:01:49.890> just<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.159> piece<00:01:50.750> the<00:01:51.750> e

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
wild style this is just a piece the e

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.039 
wild style this is just a piece the e
just<00:01:52.590> started<00:01:52.920> off<00:01:53.040> like<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:54.049> then

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
just started off like that and then

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.149 
just started off like that and then
you're<00:01:55.170> going<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.350> take<00:01:55.530> your<00:01:55.740> pencil<00:01:55.950> and

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
you're going to take your pencil and

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.560 
you're going to take your pencil and
you're<00:01:56.340> going<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.520> erase<00:01:56.790> certain<00:01:57.090> parts<00:01:57.479> that

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
you're going to erase certain parts that

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.050 
you're going to erase certain parts that
you<00:01:57.750> think<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.049> can<00:01:58.200> embellish<00:01:58.560> and

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
you think you can embellish and

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.130 
you think you can embellish and
embellishing<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.210> pretty<00:02:00.390> much<00:02:00.509> just<00:02:00.689> adding

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
embellishing is pretty much just adding

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.190 
embellishing is pretty much just adding
on<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.740> what<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.070> had<00:02:02.280> so<00:02:03.240> for<00:02:03.810> instance

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.110 
little bit so that got me that and then
I<00:02:35.080> started<00:02:35.620> with<00:02:35.769> this<00:02:35.890> theme<00:02:36.190> of<00:02:36.220> things

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
I started with this theme of things

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.030 
I started with this theme of things
coming<00:02:37.420> off<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:37.810> letters<00:02:38.110> as<00:02:38.410> you<00:02:38.650> can<00:02:38.799> see

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
coming off the letters as you can see

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.100 
coming off the letters as you can see
here<00:02:39.640> I<00:02:39.849> did<00:02:40.360> this<00:02:40.690> piece<00:02:40.959> on<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.260> R<00:02:43.080> so<00:02:44.080> that

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
here I did this piece on the R so that

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.610 
here I did this piece on the R so that
was<00:02:44.790> kind<00:02:45.790> of<00:02:45.910> established<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:46.840> style<00:02:47.170> of<00:02:47.470> the

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
was kind of established the style of the

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.850 
was kind of established the style of the
piece<00:02:48.690> this<00:02:49.690> arrow<00:02:50.049> I<00:02:50.380> don't<00:02:50.560> really<00:02:50.709> know

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
piece this arrow I don't really know

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.979 
piece this arrow I don't really know
what<00:02:50.980> I<00:02:51.040> was<00:02:51.130> thinking<00:02:51.190> there<00:02:51.670> it<00:02:52.510> really

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
what I was thinking there it really

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.500 
what I was thinking there it really
didn't<00:02:53.260> add<00:02:53.410> to<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:53.709> piece<00:02:53.950> I<00:02:54.190> think<00:02:54.549> it<00:02:54.700> took

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
didn't add to the piece I think it took

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.869 
didn't add to the piece I think it took
away<00:02:55.810> from<00:02:55.840> style<00:02:56.349> if<00:02:56.590> anything<00:02:57.010> because

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 
away from style if anything because

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:01.380 
away from style if anything because
nothing<00:02:58.120> else<00:02:58.450> has<00:02:58.629> an<00:02:58.750> arrow<00:02:58.959> on<00:02:59.049> it<00:02:59.200> so<00:03:00.390> the

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
nothing else has an arrow on it so the

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.569 
nothing else has an arrow on it so the
you<00:03:01.599> like<00:03:01.840> I<00:03:01.989> said<00:03:02.230> simple<00:03:02.560> couldn't<00:03:03.370> really

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
you like I said simple couldn't really

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:05.100 
you like I said simple couldn't really
add<00:03:03.700> anything<00:03:03.970> I<00:03:04.239> wanted<00:03:04.420> to<00:03:04.480> fit<00:03:04.690> the<00:03:04.810> rest<00:03:04.959> of

looking shape coming off the art and put

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.379 
looking shape coming off the art and put
it<00:03:16.120> on<00:03:16.209> the<00:03:16.299> D<00:03:16.450> so<00:03:16.750> there<00:03:17.230> it<00:03:17.410> is<00:03:17.470> e<00:03:18.150> same<00:03:19.150> thing

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:19.389 
it on the D so there it is e same thing

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:21.629 
it on the D so there it is e same thing
up<00:03:19.510> here<00:03:19.810> and<00:03:20.010> kind<00:03:21.010> of<00:03:21.190> to<00:03:21.310> keep<00:03:21.459> it

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
up here and kind of to keep it

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:24.479 
up here and kind of to keep it
symmetrical<00:03:22.030> I<00:03:22.660> use<00:03:23.019> the<00:03:23.200> same<00:03:23.440> pattern<00:03:23.859> to<00:03:24.340> do

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
symmetrical I use the same pattern to do

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.080 
symmetrical I use the same pattern to do
the<00:03:24.639> C<00:03:24.970> as<00:03:25.209> I<00:03:25.780> did<00:03:25.989> to<00:03:26.200> put<00:03:26.350> on<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:26.620> e<00:03:26.910> so<00:03:27.910> that's

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
the C as I did to put on the e so that's

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.970 
the C as I did to put on the e so that's
why<00:03:28.269> I<00:03:28.329> did<00:03:28.599> those<00:03:28.900> embellishments<00:03:29.319> up<00:03:29.799> there

because<00:03:43.630> it's<00:03:43.900> going<00:03:44.079> to<00:03:44.139> affect<00:03:44.530> how<00:03:44.739> you

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
because it's going to affect how you

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:47.550 
because it's going to affect how you
color<00:03:45.730> it<00:03:45.880> if<00:03:46.870> you<00:03:46.959> want<00:03:47.109> to<00:03:47.139> split<00:03:47.380> it<00:03:47.440> in<00:03:47.530> half

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
color it if you want to split it in half

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.289 
color it if you want to split it in half
if<00:03:48.010> you<00:03:48.069> want<00:03:48.130> to<00:03:48.310> just<00:03:48.519> go<00:03:48.700> crazy

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
if you want to just go crazy

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:52.259 
if you want to just go crazy
it's<00:03:50.079> up<00:03:50.200> to<00:03:50.319> you<00:03:50.739> as<00:03:51.040> I<00:03:51.370> said<00:03:51.579> it's<00:03:51.910> your<00:03:51.970> style

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
it's up to you as I said it's your style

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:53.940 
it's up to you as I said it's your style
you<00:03:52.480> can<00:03:52.599> do<00:03:52.690> what<00:03:52.810> you<00:03:52.900> want<00:03:53.079> so<00:03:53.230> I<00:03:53.349> just<00:03:53.739> put

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
you can do what you want so I just put

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.830 
you can do what you want so I just put

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
the color from the bottom and the top

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.259 
the color from the bottom and the top
and<00:03:56.380> the<00:03:56.440> top<00:03:56.650> and<00:03:56.799> the<00:03:56.889> bottom<00:03:57.120> kind<00:03:58.120> of

and the top and the bottom kind of

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:01.319 
and the top and the bottom kind of
something<00:03:58.540> that's<00:03:58.750> easy<00:03:58.930> to<00:03:59.139> do<00:03:59.819> and<00:04:00.819> then<00:04:01.239> I

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
something that's easy to do and then I

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:03.089 
something that's easy to do and then I
blended<00:04:01.720> it<00:04:01.870> right<00:04:02.049> in<00:04:02.169> the<00:04:02.230> middle<00:04:02.410> with<00:04:02.950> some

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 
blended it right in the middle with some

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:06.839 
blended it right in the middle with some
cross<00:04:03.340> hatching<00:04:03.790> and<00:04:03.970> uh<00:04:04.680> yeah<00:04:05.680> that's<00:04:06.099> it

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
cross hatching and uh yeah that's it

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:08.909 
cross hatching and uh yeah that's it
also<00:04:07.419> you<00:04:07.480> want<00:04:07.750> to<00:04:07.780> have<00:04:07.840> 3d<00:04:08.530> to<00:04:08.650> your<00:04:08.739> piece

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:08.919 
also you want to have 3d to your piece

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:11.670 
also you want to have 3d to your piece
that's<00:04:09.190> something<00:04:09.489> a<00:04:09.549> piece<00:04:09.730> needs<00:04:10.680> it's

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
that's something a piece needs it's

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.110 
that's something a piece needs it's
either<00:04:11.919> going<00:04:12.040> to<00:04:12.099> have<00:04:12.160> to<00:04:12.340> have<00:04:12.430> 3d<00:04:12.819> or<00:04:13.060> a

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
either going to have to have 3d or a

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.080 
either going to have to have 3d or a
nice<00:04:13.660> shadow<00:04:13.959> to<00:04:14.169> it<00:04:14.440> because<00:04:14.829> that<00:04:15.400> adds<00:04:15.730> to

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
nice shadow to it because that adds to

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.960 
nice shadow to it because that adds to
the<00:04:16.209> feel<00:04:16.479> of<00:04:16.510> it<00:04:16.780> in<00:04:17.470> my<00:04:18.400> book<00:04:18.609> it's<00:04:18.820> really

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
the feel of it in my book it's really

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.750 
the feel of it in my book it's really
just<00:04:19.239> not<00:04:19.329> a<00:04:20.130> complete<00:04:21.130> without<00:04:21.340> something

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
just not a complete without something

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.420 
just not a complete without something
like<00:04:21.880> that<00:04:22.090> so<00:04:22.390> I<00:04:22.710> mean<00:04:23.710> if<00:04:23.830> you<00:04:23.950> really<00:04:24.130> want

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
like that so I mean if you really want

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.530 
like that so I mean if you really want
to<00:04:24.580> you<00:04:24.700> don't<00:04:24.789> have<00:04:25.030> to

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
to you don't have to

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.480 
to you don't have to
but<00:04:25.660> I<00:04:26.490> definitely<00:04:27.490> recommend<00:04:28.120> it<00:04:29.130> next<00:04:30.130> we'll

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
but I definitely recommend it next we'll

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.460 
but I definitely recommend it next we'll
move<00:04:30.610> on<00:04:30.790> to<00:04:30.820> this<00:04:31.030> one<00:04:31.270> as<00:04:31.540> you<00:04:31.930> can<00:04:31.990> see<00:04:32.320> I'll

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
move on to this one as you can see I'll

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:33.630 
move on to this one as you can see I'll
just<00:04:32.620> go<00:04:32.770> through<00:04:32.950> the<00:04:33.010> rest<00:04:33.190> of<00:04:33.280> these<00:04:33.370> really

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
just go through the rest of these really

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.320 
just go through the rest of these really
quickly<00:04:34.230> blue<00:04:35.230> to<00:04:35.470> light<00:04:35.800> blue<00:04:35.950> fade<00:04:36.370> it's<00:04:37.120> got

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
quickly blue to light blue fade it's got

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.080 
quickly blue to light blue fade it's got
the<00:04:37.480> 3d<00:04:37.870> to<00:04:38.080> it<00:04:38.260> I<00:04:38.760> took<00:04:39.760> into<00:04:39.970> consideration

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
the 3d to it I took into consideration

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.910 
the 3d to it I took into consideration
that<00:04:40.660> the<00:04:40.780> majority<00:04:41.170> of<00:04:41.200> the<00:04:41.320> piece<00:04:41.500> is<00:04:41.680> blue

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:41.920 
that the majority of the piece is blue

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.090 
that the majority of the piece is blue
the<00:04:42.850> opposite<00:04:43.300> of<00:04:43.390> blue<00:04:43.540> is<00:04:43.750> orange<00:04:44.100> that's

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
the opposite of blue is orange that's

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.790 
the opposite of blue is orange that's
why<00:04:45.310> I<00:04:45.340> outlined<00:04:45.700> it<00:04:45.850> in<00:04:45.970> orange<00:04:46.530> this<00:04:47.530> kind<00:04:47.770> of

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
why I outlined it in orange this kind of

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.650 
why I outlined it in orange this kind of
has<00:04:47.950> a<00:04:47.980> flow<00:04:48.250> to<00:04:48.310> it<00:04:48.520> as<00:04:48.820> you<00:04:48.880> can<00:04:49.090> see<00:04:49.240> I<00:04:49.360> tried

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
has a flow to it as you can see I tried

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.660 
has a flow to it as you can see I tried
the<00:04:49.780> letter<00:04:49.990> connectors<00:04:50.530> it's<00:04:50.980> alright<00:04:51.490> I

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:51.670 
the letter connectors it's alright I

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.310 
the letter connectors it's alright I
mean<00:04:52.000> I<00:04:52.030> could<00:04:52.330> have<00:04:52.390> done<00:04:52.630> a<00:04:52.660> lot<00:04:52.840> better<00:04:53.110> if

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
mean I could have done a lot better if

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.380 
mean I could have done a lot better if
at<00:04:53.470> the<00:04:53.590> time<00:04:53.620> into<00:04:54.100> it<00:04:54.130> but<00:04:54.610> I<00:04:54.790> didn't<00:04:55.210> of

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.390 
at the time into it but I didn't of

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.680 
at the time into it but I didn't of
course<00:04:55.630> and<00:04:56.070> then<00:04:57.070> this<00:04:58.060> is<00:04:58.240> a<00:04:58.270> piece<00:04:58.510> I<00:04:58.660> did

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
course and then this is a piece I did

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.100 
course and then this is a piece I did
the<00:04:58.900> other<00:04:59.020> day<00:05:00.420> completely<00:05:01.420> bored<00:05:01.660> so<00:05:01.900> I<00:05:01.960> just

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
the other day completely bored so I just

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.680 
the other day completely bored so I just
started<00:05:02.440> drawing<00:05:02.680> a<00:05:03.250> lot<00:05:04.030> of<00:05:04.150> the<00:05:04.270> letters<00:05:04.540> are

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
started drawing a lot of the letters are

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.810 
started drawing a lot of the letters are
connected<00:05:05.170> you<00:05:05.440> can<00:05:05.500> see<00:05:05.740> the<00:05:05.830> arm<00:05:06.040> you<00:05:06.610> right

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
connected you can see the arm you right

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.940 
connected you can see the arm you right
there<00:05:07.060> see<00:05:07.510> the<00:05:07.660> are<00:05:07.840> that<00:05:08.290> one's<00:05:08.410> the<00:05:08.500> biggest

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
there see the are that one's the biggest

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.390 
there see the are that one's the biggest
one<00:05:09.220> I<00:05:09.250> think<00:05:09.400> most<00:05:09.850> obvious<00:05:10.240> d2e<00:05:11.220> this<00:05:12.220> is<00:05:12.370> a

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
one I think most obvious d2e this is a

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.660 
one I think most obvious d2e this is a
three<00:05:12.910> tone<00:05:13.090> feed<00:05:13.420> so<00:05:13.960> from<00:05:14.290> red<00:05:15.040> to<00:05:15.280> orange<00:05:15.310> to

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:15.670 
three tone feed so from red to orange to

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.020 
three tone feed so from red to orange to
yellow<00:05:16.170> warm<00:05:17.170> colors<00:05:17.590> same<00:05:17.830> family<00:05:18.250> group<00:05:18.430> so

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
yellow warm colors same family group so

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.190 
yellow warm colors same family group so
I<00:05:19.060> was<00:05:19.210> like<00:05:19.300> let's<00:05:19.480> complement<00:05:20.020> that<00:05:20.080> with

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.200 
I was like let's complement that with

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.080 
I was like let's complement that with
some<00:05:20.440> nice<00:05:20.560> cool<00:05:20.830> colors<00:05:21.220> that's<00:05:21.760> where<00:05:21.910> I<00:05:21.970> got

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
some nice cool colors that's where I got

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.220 
some nice cool colors that's where I got
the<00:05:22.210> blue<00:05:22.360> from<00:05:24.060> in<00:05:25.060> your<00:05:25.510> piece<00:05:25.750> just<00:05:26.020> make

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:26.230 
the blue from in your piece just make

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.320 
the blue from in your piece just make
the<00:05:26.320> letters<00:05:26.560> flow<00:05:26.800> like<00:05:27.040> I<00:05:27.160> said<00:05:27.430> you'll<00:05:28.270> be

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
the letters flow like I said you'll be
