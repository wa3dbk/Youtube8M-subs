we've picked on Hamburg the Aston Villa

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.990 
we've picked on Hamburg the Aston Villa
first<00:00:16.470> thing<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.740> note<00:00:16.859> here<00:00:16.890> is<00:00:17.279> we<00:00:17.430> have<00:00:17.460> a

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
first thing to note here is we have a

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.269 
first thing to note here is we have a
signal<00:00:18.869> strength<00:00:19.140> this<00:00:19.380> basically<00:00:19.890> indicates

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
signal strength this basically indicates

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.340 
signal strength this basically indicates
to<00:00:20.460> you<00:00:20.550> how<00:00:20.789> reliable<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.750> data<00:00:21.930> is<00:00:22.170> that<00:00:22.289> we

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
to you how reliable the data is that we

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.810 
to you how reliable the data is that we
feel<00:00:22.619> we're<00:00:22.980> getting<00:00:23.250> from<00:00:23.430> this<00:00:23.550> particular

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
feel we're getting from this particular

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.120 
feel we're getting from this particular
market<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:25.199> in<00:00:25.260> this<00:00:25.350> case<00:00:25.560> it's<00:00:25.740> four<00:00:25.980> out<00:00:26.099> of

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
market so in this case it's four out of

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.759 
market so in this case it's four out of
five<00:00:26.460> which<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.000> okay<00:00:27.510> but<00:00:28.349> nothing<00:00:28.680> can

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
five which is okay but nothing can

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.830 
five which is okay but nothing can
perfect<00:00:29.220> you<00:00:29.550> can<00:00:29.699> see<00:00:29.849> that<00:00:30.029> replicated<00:00:30.510> down

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
perfect you can see that replicated down

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.749 
perfect you can see that replicated down
here<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:32.070> can<00:00:32.099> see<00:00:32.340> there's<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.579> bit<00:00:32.730> of

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
here and you can see there's a bit of

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.440 
here and you can see there's a bit of
variance<00:00:33.239> here<00:00:33.570> between<00:00:34.410> what<00:00:35.219> soccer<00:00:36.090> mystic

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
variance here between what soccer mystic

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.060 
variance here between what soccer mystic
thinks<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:37.050> price<00:00:37.290> should<00:00:37.440> be<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.800> what<00:00:37.980> the

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
thinks the price should be and what the

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.760 
thinks the price should be and what the
market<00:00:38.399> thinks<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.700> price<00:00:38.879> should<00:00:39.059> be<00:00:39.120> so

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
market thinks the price should be so

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.650 
market thinks the price should be so
basically<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.010> market<00:00:41.219> is<00:00:42.980> pricing<00:00:43.980> in<00:00:44.660> two

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
basically the market is pricing in two

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.779 
basically the market is pricing in two
percent<00:00:46.050> better<00:00:46.649> chance<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.129> Hamburg<00:00:47.460> winning

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
percent better chance of Hamburg winning

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.220 
percent better chance of Hamburg winning
and<00:00:47.940> soccer<00:00:48.149> mistake<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.660> but<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:48.899> can<00:00:49.050> see

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
and soccer mistake is but you can see

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.470 
and soccer mistake is but you can see
that<00:00:49.379> there's<00:00:49.590> 0.6<00:00:50.039> percent<00:00:50.399> lost<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:51.390> the

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
that there's 0.6 percent lost to the

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.970 
that there's 0.6 percent lost to the
other<00:00:51.629> side<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.050> book<00:00:52.230> here<00:00:52.469> anyway

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
other side of the book here anyway

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.270 
other side of the book here anyway
over<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.489> under<00:00:54.620> fairly<00:00:55.620> similar<00:00:56.010> but<00:00:56.190> again

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
over and under fairly similar but again

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.619 
over and under fairly similar but again
you<00:00:56.520> can<00:00:56.670> see<00:00:56.789> there's<00:00:56.969> point<00:00:57.149> seven<00:00:57.510> percent

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
you can see there's point seven percent

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.389 
you can see there's point seven percent
lost<00:00:57.960> in<00:00:58.079> there<00:00:58.170> because<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.410> have<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.710> suck<00:00:59.370> a

mystic<00:00:59.730> is<00:00:59.789> always<00:00:59.969> going<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.149> price<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.539> to

mystic is always going to price it to

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.560 
mystic is always going to price it to
100%<00:01:01.100> and<00:01:02.100> therefore<00:01:02.520> it's<00:01:03.180> always<00:01:03.329> going<00:01:03.510> to

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
100% and therefore it's always going to

100% and therefore it's always going to
be<00:01:03.629> ever<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.140> slightly<00:01:04.409> out<00:01:04.939> but<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.030> essence

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
be ever so slightly out but the essence

be ever so slightly out but the essence
of<00:01:06.450> soccer<00:01:06.720> mystic<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:08.070> price<00:01:08.280> predictor

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
of soccer mystic and the price predictor

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.600 
of soccer mystic and the price predictor
is<00:01:09.049> to<00:01:10.049> allow<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.380> manage<00:01:10.710> your<00:01:10.740> risk<00:01:11.070> in<00:01:11.520> a

is to allow you to manage your risk in a
particular<00:01:11.850> market<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.570> I'll<00:01:12.659> demonstrate

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
particular market and I'll demonstrate

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.270 
particular market and I'll demonstrate
how<00:01:13.979> that's<00:01:14.159> possible<00:01:14.310> now<00:01:15.950> I'll<00:01:16.950> switch<00:01:17.070> off

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
how that's possible now I'll switch off

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.190 
how that's possible now I'll switch off
display<00:01:17.610> chart<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:18.030> 3d<00:01:18.390> we've<00:01:18.570> done<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.840> in<00:01:18.960> 3d

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
display chart in 3d we've done it in 3d

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.149 
display chart in 3d we've done it in 3d
just<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.820> looks<00:01:21.000> nice<00:01:21.150> basically

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
just so that it looks nice basically

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.289 
just so that it looks nice basically
so<00:01:23.400> if<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.580> switch<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:23.790> off<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.150> get<00:01:24.240> a

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
so if I switch that off you get a

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.730 
so if I switch that off you get a
slightly<00:01:24.930> more<00:01:25.140> structured<00:01:25.970> plane<00:01:26.970> graph<00:01:27.740> and

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
slightly more structured plane graph and

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.230 
slightly more structured plane graph and
what<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.070> do<00:01:29.159> here<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.520> we'll<00:01:29.670> examine<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.090> draw

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
what I do here is we'll examine the draw

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.260 
what I do here is we'll examine the draw
very<00:01:30.570> popular<00:01:30.930> strategy<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.650> lay<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.860> draw

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
very popular strategy is to lay the draw

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.830 
very popular strategy is to lay the draw
so<00:01:33.270> if<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:33.900> click<00:01:34.110> on<00:01:34.229> draw<00:01:35.420> and<00:01:36.420> we<00:01:36.570> only<00:01:36.689> have

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
so if I click on draw and we only have

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.539 
so if I click on draw and we only have
to<00:01:36.960> draw<00:01:37.170> on<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.920> I've<00:01:38.070> switched<00:01:38.250> on<00:01:38.460> the

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
to draw on and I've switched on the

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.130 
to draw on and I've switched on the
soccer<00:01:38.729> mystic<00:01:39.090> profit<00:01:39.390> line<00:01:39.540> here<00:01:39.810> as<00:01:39.930> well

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.580 
the match so you can see here the price
of<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.570> draw<00:01:45.750> starts<00:01:46.530> at<00:01:46.710> our<00:01:46.890> about<00:01:47.479> 3.8<00:01:48.479> 4<00:01:48.810> M

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
of the draw starts at our about 3.8 4 M

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.160 
of the draw starts at our about 3.8 4 M
and<00:01:49.890> then<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.100> price<00:01:50.360> eventually<00:01:51.360> moves<00:01:51.899> up

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
and then the price eventually moves up

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.280 
and then the price eventually moves up
to<00:01:53.070> 101<00:01:53.399> now<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.030> reason<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.450> this<00:01:54.689> graph<00:01:55.140> is

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
to 101 now the reason that this graph is

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.810 
to 101 now the reason that this graph is
inverted<00:01:55.829> is<00:01:55.920> because<00:01:56.189> we<00:01:56.310> have<00:01:56.430> display

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
inverted is because we have display

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.240 
inverted is because we have display
probability<00:01:57.509> chart<00:01:57.719> so<00:01:58.439> we<00:01:58.469> sing<00:01:58.799> here<00:01:59.040> is<00:01:59.130> the

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
probability chart so we sing here is the

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.100 
probability chart so we sing here is the
probability<00:01:59.430> of<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.390> draw<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:00.810> can<00:02:00.960> see

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
probability of a draw and you can see

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.660 
probability of a draw and you can see
that<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.320> probability<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:01.950> draw<00:02:02.100> increases

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
that the probability of a draw increases

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.450 
that the probability of a draw increases
as<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.119> match<00:02:03.270> progresses<00:02:03.950> obviously<00:02:04.950> we

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
as the match progresses obviously we

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.830 
as the match progresses obviously we
haven't<00:02:05.610> forecasted<00:02:06.119> any<00:02:06.210> girls<00:02:06.390> in<00:02:06.540> this<00:02:06.630> so

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
haven't forecasted any girls in this so

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.139 
haven't forecasted any girls in this so
that's<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.170> reason<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.500> you<00:02:07.619> can<00:02:07.770> see<00:02:07.950> that

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
that's the reason that you can see that

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.510 
that's the reason that you can see that
also<00:02:09.149> by<00:02:09.450> switching<00:02:09.840> on<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.530> soccer<00:02:11.160> mystic

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
also by switching on the soccer mystic

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.820 
also by switching on the soccer mystic
profit<00:02:11.849> line<00:02:12.000> you<00:02:12.629> can<00:02:12.810> see<00:02:12.989> here<00:02:13.200> it<00:02:13.290> says

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
profit line you can see here it says

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.850 
profit line you can see here it says
above<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:15.510> line<00:02:15.540> is<00:02:15.870> back<00:02:16.020> value<00:02:16.440> below<00:02:16.710> the

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
above the line is back value below the

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.500 
above the line is back value below the
line<00:02:16.980> is<00:02:17.010> slave<00:02:17.400> value<00:02:17.730> so<00:02:18.000> obviously<00:02:18.270> in<00:02:18.480> this

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
line is slave value so obviously in this

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.360 
line is slave value so obviously in this
particular<00:02:18.900> scenario<00:02:19.560> that<00:02:19.860> we've<00:02:20.010> laid<00:02:20.130> out

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
particular scenario that we've laid out

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.910 
particular scenario that we've laid out
it<00:02:20.820> says<00:02:21.360> above<00:02:21.570> the<00:02:21.690> line<00:02:21.840> is<00:02:21.870> Bank<00:02:22.200> value<00:02:22.530> so

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
it says above the line is Bank value so

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.740 
it says above the line is Bank value so
above<00:02:23.190> this<00:02:23.400> line<00:02:24.000> that<00:02:24.210> you<00:02:24.270> can<00:02:24.420> see<00:02:24.450> along

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
above this line that you can see along

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.840 
above this line that you can see along
here<00:02:24.810> all<00:02:25.410> of<00:02:25.470> this<00:02:25.830> is<00:02:26.130> backed<00:02:26.310> very<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:26.730> by

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
about two point nine nine so we back the

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.990 
about two point nine nine so we back the
draw<00:02:45.810> at<00:02:45.960> two<00:02:46.110> point<00:02:46.320> nine<00:02:46.500> nine<00:02:46.590> at<00:02:47.280> around

draw at two point nine nine at around
thirty<00:02:48.300> minutes<00:02:48.660> and<00:02:48.870> then<00:02:49.590> at<00:02:49.710> halftime<00:02:51.350> and

thirty minutes and then at halftime and

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.720 
thirty minutes and then at halftime and
let's<00:02:52.590> move<00:02:52.860> this<00:02:53.070> where<00:02:53.310> are<00:02:53.490> we<00:02:53.580> at<00:02:53.670> the

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
let's move this where are we at the

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.310 
let's move this where are we at the
moment<00:02:53.760> forty<00:02:54.330> four<00:02:54.570> point<00:02:54.720> four<00:02:54.960> there<00:02:55.110> we<00:02:55.200> go

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
moment forty four point four there we go

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.770 
moment forty four point four there we go
that's<00:02:55.530> about<00:02:55.740> half<00:02:55.920> time<00:02:56.270> click<00:02:57.270> again<00:02:57.540> and

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
that's about half time click again and

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.510 
that's about half time click again and
you<00:02:57.840> can<00:02:57.990> see<00:02:58.170> at<00:02:58.350> 45<00:02:58.740> minutes<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.160> draw<00:02:59.340> be

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
you can see at 45 minutes the draw be

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.120 
you can see at 45 minutes the draw be
about<00:02:59.670> 247<00:03:00.540> so<00:03:01.290> if<00:03:01.350> we<00:03:01.440> Bank<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:01.770> draw<00:03:01.920> at<00:03:01.980> two

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
about 247 so if we Bank the draw at two

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.430 
about 247 so if we Bank the draw at two
nine<00:03:02.280> nine<00:03:02.310> laid<00:03:02.760> it<00:03:02.880> off<00:03:02.970> at<00:03:03.090> 247<00:03:03.810> you'd<00:03:04.200> make

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
nine nine laid it off at 247 you'd make

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.830 
nine nine laid it off at 247 you'd make
fifty<00:03:05.100> two<00:03:05.250> tix<00:03:05.790> fifty<00:03:06.240> two<00:03:06.360> percent<00:03:06.510> or

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
fifty two tix fifty two percent or

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.780 
fifty two tix fifty two percent or
however<00:03:07.020> you<00:03:07.260> want<00:03:07.410> to<00:03:07.470> rationalize<00:03:08.280> your

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
however you want to rationalize your

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.060 
however you want to rationalize your
risk<00:03:08.940> in<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.210> market<00:03:09.540> so<00:03:09.690> you<00:03:09.720> can<00:03:09.900> see<00:03:10.080> in<00:03:10.350> 15

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
risk in the market so you can see in 15

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.130 
risk in the market so you can see in 15
minutes<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.940> probabilities<00:03:12.540> moved<00:03:12.780> 70

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
minutes the probabilities moved 70

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.480 
minutes the probabilities moved 70
percent<00:03:13.470> and<00:03:13.850> it's<00:03:14.850> moved<00:03:15.150> by<00:03:16.140> fifty<00:03:17.130> two<00:03:17.250> so

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
percent and it's moved by fifty two so

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.270 
percent and it's moved by fifty two so
you<00:03:18.209> can<00:03:18.300> see<00:03:18.600> here<00:03:18.810> that<00:03:19.050> obviously<00:03:19.770> that's<00:03:20.040> a

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
you can see here that obviously that's a

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.030 
you can see here that obviously that's a
profitable<00:03:21.060> scenario<00:03:21.530> what<00:03:22.530> a<00:03:22.560> lot<00:03:22.739> of<00:03:22.770> people

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
profitable scenario what a lot of people

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.520 
profitable scenario what a lot of people
that<00:03:23.130> though<00:03:23.520> is<00:03:23.730> they<00:03:24.000> don't<00:03:24.120> back<00:03:25.110> the<00:03:25.350> draw

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
that though is they don't back the draw

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.260

they<00:03:25.739> lay<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.220> draw<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:26.970> reason<00:03:27.180> they

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
they lay the draw and the reason they

they lay the draw and the reason they
laid<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:27.540> draw<00:03:27.690> is<00:03:27.750> because<00:03:28.110> of<00:03:28.230> what<00:03:28.320> happens

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620

of course the problem you have is if the

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
equation a bit you know and let's have a

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.610 
equation a bit you know and let's have a
look<00:04:27.950> at<00:04:28.040> how<00:04:28.160> that<00:04:29.110> messes<00:04:30.110> up<00:04:30.170> the<00:04:30.290> equation

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
look at how that messes up the equation

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.920 
look at how that messes up the equation
if<00:04:30.710> I<00:04:30.800> click<00:04:31.010> on<00:04:31.160> away<00:04:31.640> goal<00:04:31.910> can<00:04:32.630> you<00:04:32.690> see<00:04:32.810> what

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
if I click on away goal can you see what

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.740 
if I click on away goal can you see what
happens<00:04:33.230> instead<00:04:33.680> of<00:04:34.300> laying<00:04:35.300> the<00:04:35.420> drawer<00:04:35.660> and

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
happens instead of laying the drawer and

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.420 
happens instead of laying the drawer and
being<00:04:35.930> into<00:04:36.170> profit<00:04:36.560> we're<00:04:36.830> not<00:04:36.950> actually<00:04:37.130> in

being into profit we're not actually in

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.690 
being into profit we're not actually in
profit<00:04:37.820> for<00:04:38.120> a<00:04:38.180> long<00:04:38.390> long<00:04:38.600> time<00:04:38.780> and<00:04:38.840> in<00:04:39.050> fact

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
profit for a long long time and in fact

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.070 
profit for a long long time and in fact
we<00:04:40.700> can<00:04:40.850> put<00:04:41.030> the<00:04:41.120> crosshairs<00:04:41.570> here<00:04:41.840> and<00:04:42.020> you

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
we can put the crosshairs here and you

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.960 
we can put the crosshairs here and you
can<00:04:42.200> see<00:04:42.410> it's<00:04:42.560> about<00:04:42.680> 50<00:04:43.370> minutes<00:04:43.670> or<00:04:43.820> so

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
can see it's about 50 minutes or so

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.760 
can see it's about 50 minutes or so
before<00:04:44.180> it<00:04:44.540> begins<00:04:44.750> to<00:04:44.870> get<00:04:45.050> into<00:04:45.230> profit<00:04:45.590> and

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
before it begins to get into profit and

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.420 
before it begins to get into profit and
in<00:04:46.220> fact<00:04:46.460> it's<00:04:46.640> about<00:04:46.730> 60<00:04:47.390> before<00:04:48.310> you<00:04:49.310> know

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
in fact it's about 60 before you know

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.910 
in fact it's about 60 before you know
you<00:04:49.490> get<00:04:49.910> to<00:04:50.030> true<00:04:50.210> profitability<00:04:50.660> so<00:04:50.920> you

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:51.920 
you get to true profitability so you

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.320 
you get to true profitability so you
know<00:04:52.010> that<00:04:52.190> changes<00:04:52.610> your<00:04:52.730> perspective<00:04:52.970> a<00:04:53.300> bit
