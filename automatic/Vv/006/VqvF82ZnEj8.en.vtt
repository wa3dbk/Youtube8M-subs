actually so you twist that and it

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.010 
actually so you twist that and it
releases<00:03:09.380> a<00:03:09.560> cable<00:03:10.450> and<00:03:11.450> then<00:03:11.570> you<00:03:11.660> lift<00:03:11.900> the

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
releases a cable and then you lift the

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.530 
releases a cable and then you lift the
back<00:03:12.170> seat<00:03:12.440> up<00:03:12.590> so<00:03:12.740> that's<00:03:13.150> where<00:03:14.150> your<00:03:14.270> trunk

right there this is bigger than I

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:20.879 
right there this is bigger than I
thought

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:20.889 
thought

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:23.040 
thought
there's<00:05:21.789> actually<00:05:22.150> some<00:05:22.300> more<00:05:22.449> space<00:05:22.690> if<00:05:22.900> I

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
there's actually some more space if I

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.670 
there's actually some more space if I
put<00:05:23.259> some<00:05:23.409> more<00:05:23.560> stuff<00:05:23.770> in<00:05:23.860> there

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.969 

it<00:05:27.280> looks<00:05:27.430> really<00:05:27.729> good<00:05:28.770> there's<00:05:29.770> the<00:05:29.919> other

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:29.979 
it looks really good there's the other

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:35.790 
it looks really good there's the other
side<00:05:33.210> load<00:05:34.210> limit<00:05:34.660> one<00:05:35.260> and<00:05:35.410> a<00:05:35.440> half<00:05:35.560> kilograms

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
side load limit one and a half kilograms

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.360 
side load limit one and a half kilograms
so<00:05:36.220> they<00:05:36.340> can<00:05:36.430> only<00:05:36.520> hold<00:05:36.729> three<00:05:36.970> pounds<00:05:38.190> and<00:05:39.190> I

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
so they can only hold three pounds and I

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.939 
so they can only hold three pounds and I
got<00:05:39.610> you<00:05:39.760> can<00:05:39.910> hold<00:05:40.060> more<00:05:40.210> than<00:05:40.360> that<00:05:40.650> and<00:05:41.650> this

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:41.949 
got you can hold more than that and this

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:44.100 
got you can hold more than that and this
is<00:05:42.100> your<00:05:42.340> little<00:05:42.520> 12-volt<00:05:43.330> key<00:05:43.510> accessory
