a second in two weeks as well yeah you
know<00:00:25.050> I<00:00:25.199> think<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.500> biggest<00:00:25.680> thing<00:00:25.859> for<00:00:26.010> Regis

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
know I think the biggest thing for Regis

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.859 
know I think the biggest thing for Regis
is<00:00:26.490> breaking<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:26.910> resistance<00:00:27.359> you<00:00:27.599> when<00:00:27.779> you

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
is breaking the resistance you when you

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.210 
is breaking the resistance you when you
can<00:00:27.990> away<00:00:28.109> from<00:00:28.260> home<00:00:28.410> in<00:00:28.619> teams<00:00:28.830> are<00:00:28.949> hard<00:00:29.099> to

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
can away from home in teams are hard to

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.710 
can away from home in teams are hard to
beat<00:00:29.400> that<00:00:29.429> up<00:00:29.609> for<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.880> gear<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.599> begin

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
beat that up for the gear and to begin

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.479 
beat that up for the gear and to begin
the<00:00:30.990> first<00:00:31.199> school<00:00:31.380> they<00:00:31.500> got<00:00:31.679> that<00:00:31.830> but<00:00:32.279> can

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
the first school they got that but can

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.770 
the first school they got that but can
they<00:00:32.610> go<00:00:32.730> get<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.210> know<00:00:33.300> come<00:00:33.540> they<00:00:33.660> go

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
they go get that you know come they go

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.420 
they go get that you know come they go
get<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.079> Keller<00:00:34.290> second<00:00:34.680> goal<00:00:34.829> can<00:00:35.040> be<00:00:35.070> really
