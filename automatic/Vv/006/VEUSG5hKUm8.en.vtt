dips<00:00:59.649> of<00:00:59.860> all<00:01:00.010> times<00:01:00.309> and<00:01:00.579> it<00:01:00.640> starts<00:01:01.030> live

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
dips of all times and it starts live

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.360 
dips of all times and it starts live
with<00:01:01.360> the<00:01:01.420> humble<00:01:01.780> English<00:01:02.379> cucumber<00:01:02.980> now<00:01:03.340> I

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
with the humble English cucumber now I

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.310 
with the humble English cucumber now I
am<00:01:03.610> going<00:01:03.879> to<00:01:04.059> peel<00:01:04.449> this<00:01:04.659> one<00:01:04.869> it's<00:01:05.019> also<00:01:05.199> a

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
am going to peel this one it's also a

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.450 
am going to peel this one it's also a
massive<00:01:05.560> one<00:01:05.800> I'm<00:01:05.890> probably<00:01:06.040> only<00:01:06.220> going<00:01:06.369> to

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
massive one I'm probably only going to

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.399 
massive one I'm probably only going to
use<00:01:06.550> half<00:01:06.610> of<00:01:07.060> this<00:01:07.240> so<00:01:07.930> I'm<00:01:08.050> going<00:01:08.200> to<00:01:08.229> cut

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409

this<00:01:08.560> one<00:01:08.619> in<00:01:08.800> half<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:10.119> I<00:01:10.299> reckon<00:01:10.570> that<00:01:10.720> will

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
this one in half and I reckon that will

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:13.530 
this one in half and I reckon that will
make<00:01:11.049> us<00:01:11.200> about<00:01:11.409> two<00:01:11.680> cups<00:01:11.950> of<00:01:12.130> cucumber<00:01:13.000> but

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
make us about two cups of cucumber but
