00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.740
 the period magazine did a report 

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.460
 showing indexes that the tyririca can not read and write the citizen 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.870
 complete illiterate 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.570
 has a video on you tube where he has helped his son to understand what 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.449
 is written 

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:14.619
 an active role 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:19.439
 reporter gives it to him and the promoter Mauricio AntÃ´nio ribeiro lopes asked 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.869
 authorization to perform a reading and writing test with the 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:23.739
 tiririca 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:27.470
 nietzsche would like to do this second visit tomorrow 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.600
 This means that 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.089
 24 hours 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:33.040
 to learn how to read and write 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.180
 if you want to continue competing 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.069
 to the position of federal deputy 

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:40.720
 so I suggest you start learning the vowels right. 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.789
 Sent it. 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:46.679
 after the consonants try to form citizens who knows with an effort 

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:47.880
 about human 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.360
 it may be the fact of being in a day so maybe he can ask for everything the 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.490
 lolinha's son 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.069
 probably a child 

00:00:56.069 --> 00:01:01.329
 for who loves 600 reais in 2002 and after lula took the post there were millions 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.269
 maybe travel inter-islands aleix strike 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.740
 good now talking quite serious people in brazil 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.220
 still has 14 million illiterates, with one in five 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.180
 20% of the population is functional illiterate in less than 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.540
 four years of study 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.940
 in practice 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:27.850
 deic guy and no one is slow between 2005 and 2007 in the government squid rate 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.710
 of illiteracy falls per year 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.830
 less than 1% has been practically stagnant, it is clear that the Lula government is not 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.700
 directly responsible for bc in the forest high school municipal education 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.160
 state but I wonder why already in 2003 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.130
 in the field 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.080
 the great sea campaign 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.950
 the federal program 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.890
 incentive to education 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.000
 could be a 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.860
 acceleration program 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.399
 In education, Brazil. 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.149
 the federal effort to coordinate and completely eradicate illiteracy in the 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.749
 Brazil 

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:03.330
 I'm sure if it was an effort 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.909
 very strong in this regard 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.789
 in those eight years hour illiteracy rate would have fallen much more 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.209
 talk then I eat paulistano 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.599
 I am ashamed 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:17.529
 had predictions that Tiraica could win 1,000 votes in the census with one million 

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:18.899
 of votes 

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:22.339
 of voters who are not illiterate with it 

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:24.790
 are at least functional illiterates 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.749
 has no power to evaluate 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:31.159
 the quality of a candidate and this criticism even for those who declared 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:34.779
 that votes in the tiririca like a protest vote that I already showed in another 

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:37.720
 video if totally useless and still disastrous 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.419
 because it helps messes the comdema would like to elect anyway 

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:44.809
 I'm looking for an opportunistic party. 

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:46.299
 the party of the republic 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.859
 who is the party that accepted the candidacy of the Torah even knowing 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:55.089
 that he did not know how to write and the most regrettable is that the party is linked 

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:56.950
 just with pt 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.080
 Maybe it's the worst part of Brazil. 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.990
 and who knows everything 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.900
 lg 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.190
 your candidates 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.690
 even to quote 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.279
 a coalition with their party 

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:08.919
 who are not candidates 

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:10.519
 alias popular ' 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.090
 just to spend several dead 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.520
 even do not know or read I signed up 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.079
 including the despair of the pt who elects 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:20.899
 its candidates and so great 

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:25.319
 who has just filed a direct action of unconstitutionality in the 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:26.920
 Federal Court of Justice 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.790
 to overthrow the requirement 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.110
 of two documents at the time of voting that requirement was made 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.170
 to avoid fraud 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.499
 check here that person who is actually the voter the pt link 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.879
 would be detrimental to poorer voters, but rather 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:45.529
 no involvement with theft 

00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:48.300
 just elect of pt 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.410
 the poorest 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.859
 the less educated 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:52.589
 is that type of voter 

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:53.909
 that ptb has 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:57.209
 you see that is an illiteracy rate is concentrated in the 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.090
 as well as a poverty rate 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.150
 and it's amazing that a party with the pt sees a tent 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.169
 of this type of cancerous lesion 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:06.040
 that is 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.400
 for them it is interesting to maintain this poverty and this rate of illiteracy 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.489
 so he guarantees votes 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.590
 I want to see in a future 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:15.589
 Gabriel 

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:16.769
 where you 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.329
 Eradicate the illiteracy rate has clarified the population eradicate 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.800
 poverty if a party with the pt will remain in 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.639
 people will be educated and will be able to 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:32.110
 best candidates the best parties 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.600
 this is the extent to which the writer 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.639
 will be applied tiririca 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:39.690
 has to be done urgently because if it is done 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:40.969
 before the election 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:43.059
 in showing that he is illiterate 

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:46.260
 oshkosh that went to the ninja will be nullified 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.630
 and however, it is not accurate after the election that the votes 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.840
 are for the tiririca will be an invitation computed for the coalition deserved 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.300
 matches with pt 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.330
 such as pmdb itself 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.970
 the solution presents wages we would have to institute the vote 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.810
 in Brazil a large proportion of these team voters 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.240
 completely alienated 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.319
 functional and political illiterates 

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:16.419
 let in directing this of candidates who will help others the real ones 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:17.409
 corrupt 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:22.369
 because who chooses its candidate based on popularity 

00:05:22.369 --> 00:05:22.940
 living room 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.040
 is not politically aware 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.150
 and this person if the vote were optional would certainly not come back 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:30.969
 and I keep saying 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:32.389
 once again 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:34.979
 Lula should thank the press 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:37.320
 because if it was not for the reporting of the time 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.669
 mania questions if she knows how to read or write 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:44.409
 once again the congratulatory press giving a great service to Brazil 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.849
 helping to prevent 

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:49.849
 that a candidate of very low level as tiririca 

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:51.800
 be elected 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.889
 dragging even worse ones
