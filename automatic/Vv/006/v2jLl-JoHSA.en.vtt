00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.840
 I'll show you some excerpts from 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.930
 a final cruise to southern france 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.340
 and i just hope that the video is one 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.820
 a bit more sunshine and 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.099
 maybe a little summer hole in it 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.380
 Germany now brings to you 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.029
 and everyone really very much almost 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.619
 would watch my say yes 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.660
 facial expression you can already tell how 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.760
 I get excited about it, we're at night 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.090
 then you drove directly to the next 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.579
 day already in the south of france and us 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.250
 had a great layout and it was 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.530
 just as nice there right next 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.120
 day drove back to MÃ¼nster 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.590
 we'll probably hear it again 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.260
 facial expression that I am very happy 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.850
 about it because I've never been there and it 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.039
 is just so nice to the 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.100
 landscape and the city center is 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.809
 wonderfully easy and the food has 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.239
 you belong sooo delicious so if you 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.360
 Lately there's everyone 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.880
 eat case and I'll show you now too 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.100
 Here is my outfit for a short time which is relative 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.829
 Convenience was actually just one 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.560
 gray pullover and my loved ones 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:18.390
 hair in sport and shoes with heel 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.350
 but they were really comfortable 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.939
 actually and after such a long day 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.340
 of course she went to eat white 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.049
 and if eating was not that awesome 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.930
 that may have a bit too much 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.670
 then we have the evening just eyes 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.700
 still spent at the beach which was also very 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.380
 was nice and I tell you that makes 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.600
 once so much fun just by the sea too 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.469
 sit up and take time with his 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.469
 to spend friends 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.420
 The next day we had such a kind 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.920
 Active day where we went hiking 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.990
 that would not be so much excerpts 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.210
 by but it was so much fun 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.830
 just to experience the landscape and there 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.950
 to walk long and it was just 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.350
 beautiful and then we are in the pool 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.810
 went swimming well what wonderful 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.490
 was and I liked it so much 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.760
 After that it was already the next day 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:13.000

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.890

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.440
 We are then first to the palace 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.660

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.790
 guided and here you see 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.260

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.100

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.800
 even when we went there 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.410
 looked at and that was already 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.209
 really impressive and that 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.459
 we have then in cannes penultimate day 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.739

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.370
 outlook on can and this island was 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.360

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:25.150
 with my feet and that was just like that 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:27.340
 Great because it is so undeveloped and everything 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.959

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.389

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.020

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.810
