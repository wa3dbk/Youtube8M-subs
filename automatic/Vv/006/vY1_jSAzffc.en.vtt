after i had already understood the
evolutionary<00:00:27.060> perspective<00:00:27.660> so<00:00:27.869> i<00:00:28.400> didn't

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
evolutionary perspective so i didn't

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.030 
evolutionary perspective so i didn't
have<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:30.269> prerequisite<00:00:30.960> understanding<00:00:31.769> of

presented<00:00:36.300> that<00:00:36.800> I<00:00:37.800> was<00:00:38.370> able<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.670> work<00:00:39.059> to

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
this is just the way I came across them

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.050 
this is just the way I came across them
into<00:01:19.710> why<00:01:19.890> it's<00:01:20.130> worded<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.640> way<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:20.880> it

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
into why it's worded the way it is it

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.730 
into why it's worded the way it is it
doesn't<00:01:21.330> necessarily<00:01:21.930> mean<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.170> if<00:01:22.470> this<00:01:22.619> is

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
doesn't necessarily mean that if this is

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.830 
doesn't necessarily mean that if this is
exactly<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.369> way<00:01:23.490> things<00:01:23.549> happen<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.689> was

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
exactly the way things happen it was

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.660 
exactly the way things happen it was
just<00:01:24.930> praise<00:01:25.229> this<00:01:25.470> way<00:01:25.680> so<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:26.280> people

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
just praise this way so that people

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.700 
just praise this way so that people
would<00:01:26.820> keep<00:01:27.060> me<00:01:27.509> telling<00:01:27.960> story<00:01:28.320> even<00:01:28.619> though

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
would keep me telling story even though

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.350 
would keep me telling story even though
I<00:01:28.799> would<00:01:28.920> eventually<00:01:29.340> figure<00:01:29.880> out<00:01:29.939> what<00:01:30.240> it

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
I would eventually figure out what it

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.330 
I would eventually figure out what it
really<00:01:30.390> meant<00:01:31.549> and<00:01:32.600> you<00:01:33.600> get<00:01:34.290> happens<00:01:34.920> back<00:01:35.100> to

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
really meant and you get happens back to

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.069 
really meant and you get happens back to
the<00:01:35.490> idea<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.150> can't<00:01:36.420> go<00:01:36.630> back<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.990> your

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
the idea that you can't go back to your

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
to be interpreted they answered with it

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.709 
to be interpreted they answered with it
something<00:01:56.159> that<00:01:56.189> completely<00:01:56.640> threw<00:01:57.210> me<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.509> had

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
something that completely threw me I had

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.209 
something that completely threw me I had
no<00:01:58.049> concept<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.649> what<00:01:58.710> they<00:01:58.920> were<00:01:58.979> talking

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
no concept of what they were talking

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.590 
no concept of what they were talking
about<00:01:59.430> this<00:01:59.700> oh<00:01:59.820> well<00:01:59.850> then<00:02:00.119> what<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.420> the

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
about this oh well then what is the

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.740 
about this oh well then what is the
meaning<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:00.930> life<00:02:01.310> and<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.820> remember<00:02:03.060> be<00:02:03.210> what

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
meaning of life and I remember be what

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.740 
meaning of life and I remember be what
the<00:02:03.899> hell's<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:04.229> got<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:04.619> do<00:02:04.740> with<00:02:04.890> anything

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
the hell's that got to do with anything

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.520 
the hell's that got to do with anything
um<00:02:07.429> to<00:02:08.429> me<00:02:08.610> being<00:02:09.209> questioned<00:02:09.869> about<00:02:09.959> the

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
um to me being questioned about the

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
um to me being questioned about the
meaning<00:02:10.709> of<00:02:10.860> what<00:02:11.009> at<00:02:11.310> that<00:02:11.580> time<00:02:11.959> was<00:02:12.959> not

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
meaning of what at that time was not

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.390 
meaning of what at that time was not
significantly<00:02:14.530> different<00:02:15.530> than<00:02:15.680> the

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
significantly different than the

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.180 
significantly different than the
demeaning<00:02:16.790> of<00:02:17.030> TVs<00:02:17.630> or<00:02:18.050> if<00:02:18.170> you<00:02:18.350> throw<00:02:19.010> the

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
demeaning of TVs or if you throw the

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.950 
demeaning of TVs or if you throw the
chicken<00:02:19.400> bones<00:02:19.790> out<00:02:20.030> you<00:02:20.240> have<00:02:20.360> some<00:02:20.600> mystic

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
chicken bones out you have some mystic

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.750 
chicken bones out you have some mystic
try<00:02:21.170> to<00:02:21.230> read<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:21.770> way<00:02:21.890> that<00:02:22.070> they<00:02:22.190> fell<00:02:22.460> okay

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
try to read the way that they fell okay

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.040 
try to read the way that they fell okay
so<00:02:22.820> they<00:02:23.030> feel<00:02:23.180> this<00:02:23.330> way<00:02:23.510> but<00:02:23.570> what<00:02:23.810> does<00:02:23.930> it

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
so they feel this way but what does it

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.790 
so they feel this way but what does it
mean<00:02:24.340> well<00:02:25.340> it<00:02:25.430> was<00:02:25.550> just<00:02:25.760> as<00:02:25.970> empty<00:02:26.420> for<00:02:27.350> me<00:02:27.500> in

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
mean well it was just as empty for me in

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.910 
mean well it was just as empty for me in
at<00:02:28.310> that<00:02:28.520> time<00:02:28.580> as<00:02:29.000> TVs<00:02:29.930> or<00:02:30.140> chicken<00:02:30.440> bones<00:02:30.650> but

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
at that time as TVs or chicken bones but

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.570 
at that time as TVs or chicken bones but
later<00:02:31.820> as<00:02:32.210> I<00:02:33.080> got<00:02:33.260> into<00:02:33.560> this<00:02:33.740> this<00:02:34.250> debate

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
later as I got into this this debate

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.430 
later as I got into this this debate
with<00:02:34.850> theologians<00:02:35.480> and<00:02:35.630> such<00:02:35.900> I<00:02:36.050> realize<00:02:36.410> that

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
with theologians and such I realize that

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.990 
with theologians and such I realize that
there<00:02:36.710> were<00:02:36.830> deeper<00:02:37.190> aspects<00:02:37.670> of<00:02:37.820> that

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
there were deeper aspects of that

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.030 
there were deeper aspects of that
question<00:02:38.420> I<00:02:38.480> expect<00:02:38.810> that<00:02:39.620> we're<00:02:39.800> going<00:02:39.890> to<00:02:39.950> be

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
question I expect that we're going to be

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.410 
question I expect that we're going to be
talking<00:02:40.250> about<00:02:40.580> these<00:02:40.880> as<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.240> show

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
talking about these as the show

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.090 
talking about these as the show
progresses<00:02:41.900> I<00:02:42.200> actually<00:02:42.410> wanted<00:02:42.860> to<00:02:42.920> get

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
progresses I actually wanted to get

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.170 
progresses I actually wanted to get
other<00:02:43.340> people's<00:02:43.820> perspectives<00:02:44.830> explaining

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
other people's perspectives explaining

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.370 
other people's perspectives explaining
how<00:02:47.180> they<00:02:47.390> immediate<00:02:47.870> life<00:02:48.020> and<00:02:48.200> I'd<00:02:48.260> like<00:02:48.320> to

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
how they immediate life and I'd like to

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.900 
how they immediate life and I'd like to
do<00:02:48.530> some<00:02:48.680> comparisons<00:02:49.280> of<00:02:49.370> that<00:02:49.580> before<00:02:49.880> you

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
do some comparisons of that before you

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.660 
do some comparisons of that before you
go<00:02:50.030> further<00:02:50.240> into<00:02:50.420> my<00:02:51.110> unboxing<00:02:51.440> matter<00:02:51.920> safe

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
go further into my unboxing matter safe

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.180 
go further into my unboxing matter safe
here<00:02:52.910> would<00:02:53.630> you<00:02:53.720> like<00:02:53.840> to<00:02:54.910> comment<00:02:55.910> on<00:02:56.120> that

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
here would you like to comment on that

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.630 
here would you like to comment on that
well<00:02:58.190> um<00:02:58.880> for<00:02:59.840> me<00:02:59.960> it's<00:03:00.260> it's<00:03:00.590> more<00:03:00.860> on<00:03:01.310> what

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
well um for me it's it's more on what

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.480 
well um for me it's it's more on what
level<00:03:01.790> are<00:03:02.000> you<00:03:02.090> asking<00:03:02.690> this<00:03:02.810> question

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490 
level are you asking this question

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.880 
level are you asking this question
meaning<00:03:04.490> of<00:03:04.580> life<00:03:04.730> are<00:03:05.030> really<00:03:05.300> broad<00:03:05.890> context

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
meaning of life are really broad context

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.890 
meaning of life are really broad context
I'm<00:03:07.760> with<00:03:08.030> you<00:03:08.240> I<00:03:08.270> don't<00:03:08.450> think<00:03:08.600> there's

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
I'm with you I don't think there's

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.530 
I'm with you I don't think there's
really<00:03:09.050> a<00:03:09.230> geological<00:03:10.220> argument<00:03:10.730> we<00:03:10.910> need<00:03:11.120> for

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
really a geological argument we need for

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.340 
really a geological argument we need for
it<00:03:11.770> I<00:03:13.270> mean<00:03:14.270> sure<00:03:14.600> there's<00:03:14.840> probably<00:03:15.230> a

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
it I mean sure there's probably a

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.560 
it I mean sure there's probably a
proximate<00:03:16.010> cause<00:03:16.250> of<00:03:16.280> reproduction<00:03:17.240> but<00:03:17.420> as

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
proximate cause of reproduction but as

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.479 
proximate cause of reproduction but as
far<00:03:17.750> as<00:03:17.810> ultimate<00:03:18.380> cause<00:03:18.590> is<00:03:18.860> concerned<00:03:19.340> I

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
far as ultimate cause is concerned I

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.170 
far as ultimate cause is concerned I
don't<00:03:19.670> really<00:03:19.910> think<00:03:20.000> there<00:03:20.360> is<00:03:20.510> well<00:03:22.180> we're

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
don't really think there is well we're

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.449 
don't really think there is well we're
concerned<00:03:23.540> the<00:03:24.140> meaning<00:03:24.410> of<00:03:24.500> life<00:03:24.560> is<00:03:25.010> willing

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
concerned the meaning of life is willing

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.540 
concerned the meaning of life is willing
whatever<00:03:25.880> you<00:03:26.120> decide<00:03:26.600> it<00:03:26.959> to<00:03:27.230> be<00:03:27.410> for<00:03:27.920> you<00:03:28.340> as

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
whatever you decide it to be for you as

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.729 
whatever you decide it to be for you as
a<00:03:28.580> person<00:03:29.120> and<00:03:29.900> that's<00:03:30.110> pretty<00:03:30.320> much<00:03:30.440> where<00:03:30.709> I

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
a person and that's pretty much where I

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:36.550 
a person and that's pretty much where I
stand<00:03:32.020> Thunder<00:03:33.520> well<00:03:34.520> um<00:03:35.510> if<00:03:36.260> you<00:03:36.410> actually

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
stand Thunder well um if you actually

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.870 
stand Thunder well um if you actually
take<00:03:36.800> a<00:03:36.830> look<00:03:37.010> at<00:03:37.100> the<00:03:37.160> universe<00:03:37.520> what<00:03:37.790> it

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
take a look at the universe what it

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.600 
take a look at the universe what it
tends<00:03:38.090> to<00:03:38.209> do<00:03:38.390> is<00:03:40.570> minimizes<00:03:41.570> free<00:03:41.840> energy<00:03:42.170> and

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
tends to do is minimizes free energy and

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.000 
tends to do is minimizes free energy and
however<00:03:43.610> the<00:03:43.820> universe<00:03:44.150> is<00:03:44.300> also<00:03:44.630> a<00:03:45.170> keen<00:03:45.890> on

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
however the universe is also a keen on

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:52.180 
however the universe is also a keen on
equilibrium<00:03:46.690> problem<00:03:47.690> so<00:03:50.230> in<00:03:51.230> terms<00:03:51.620> of<00:03:51.920> what

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
equilibrium problem so in terms of what

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.729 
equilibrium problem so in terms of what
does<00:03:52.220> the<00:03:52.489> universe<00:03:52.820> want<00:03:53.270> to<00:03:53.360> do<00:03:53.510> it<00:03:54.140> wants<00:03:54.590> to

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
does the universe want to do it wants to

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.490 
does the universe want to do it wants to
sort<00:03:54.920> of<00:03:55.040> minimize<00:03:55.370> its<00:03:55.610> free<00:03:55.820> energy<00:03:56.500> and

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
sort of minimize its free energy and

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.800 
sort of minimize its free energy and
that<00:03:58.280> if<00:03:58.580> you<00:03:58.970> actually<00:03:59.090> follow<00:03:59.420> out<00:03:59.570> three

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
that if you actually follow out three

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.810 
that if you actually follow out three
does<00:03:59.989> versal<00:04:00.380> implications<00:04:01.070> for<00:04:01.640> and

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
does versal implications for and

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:09.660 
does versal implications for and
civilizations<00:04:04.820> and<00:04:05.030> the<00:04:05.090> such<00:04:05.270> like<00:04:05.540> in<00:04:05.780> that

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.830 

maybe<00:04:10.670> basically<00:04:11.060> boils<00:04:11.330> down<00:04:11.360> to<00:04:11.660> more

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
maybe basically boils down to more

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.000 
maybe basically boils down to more
likely<00:04:13.090> the<00:04:14.090> structures<00:04:14.680> or<00:04:15.680> more

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
likely the structures or more

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.740 
likely the structures or more
energetically<00:04:16.580> favorable<00:04:17.090> structures<00:04:17.540> are

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
energetically favorable structures are

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.960 
energetically favorable structures are
more<00:04:17.989> likely<00:04:18.200> so<00:04:19.040> for<00:04:19.250> instance<00:04:19.280> this<00:04:19.669> is<00:04:19.820> why

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
more likely so for instance this is why

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.029 
more likely so for instance this is why
you<00:04:20.030> get<00:04:20.209> protons<00:04:20.750> and<00:04:21.230> don't<00:04:21.739> have<00:04:21.890> them

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:22.039 
you get protons and don't have them

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:24.430 
you get protons and don't have them
flying<00:04:22.280> around<00:04:22.460> its<00:04:22.669> quirks<00:04:23.110> similarly<00:04:24.110> the

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
flying around its quirks similarly the

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.420 
flying around its quirks similarly the
reason<00:04:24.770> that<00:04:24.800> you<00:04:24.979> get<00:04:25.130> civilizations

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
reason that you get civilizations

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.129 
reason that you get civilizations
is<00:04:26.550> because<00:04:27.150> they<00:04:27.300> can<00:04:27.449> serve<00:04:27.660> pump<00:04:27.990> the

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:28.139 
is because they can serve pump the

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:29.960 
is because they can serve pump the
energy<00:04:28.440> around<00:04:28.530> company<00:04:29.370> knowledge<00:04:29.729> around

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
energy around company knowledge around

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.020 
energy around company knowledge around
and<00:04:30.860> that<00:04:31.860> in<00:04:32.190> that<00:04:32.340> sense<00:04:32.610> they're<00:04:32.850> more

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
and that in that sense they're more

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.129 
and that in that sense they're more
viable<00:04:33.300> and<00:04:35.030> so<00:04:36.030> if<00:04:36.479> you<00:04:36.630> like<00:04:36.780> there<00:04:36.990> is<00:04:37.110> a

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
viable and so if you like there is a

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:39.050 
viable and so if you like there is a
natural<00:04:37.650> order<00:04:37.860> to<00:04:38.009> things<00:04:38.160> do<00:04:38.669> you<00:04:38.699> call<00:04:38.940> up

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
natural order to things do you call up

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.400 
natural order to things do you call up

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.620

the<00:04:44.009> foundational<00:04:44.669> falsehoods<00:04:45.120> of<00:04:45.240> creation

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
the foundational falsehoods of creation

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.990 
the foundational falsehoods of creation
as<00:04:45.750> my<00:04:45.780> finger<00:04:46.110> was<00:04:46.199> part<00:04:46.470> two<00:04:47.539> where<00:04:49.699> yet<00:04:50.699> even

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
as my finger was part two where yet even

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.100 
as my finger was part two where yet even
if<00:04:51.090> you<00:04:51.180> don't<00:04:51.360> know<00:04:51.509> what<00:04:51.690> the<00:04:51.720> meaning<00:04:51.990> of

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
if you don't know what the meaning of

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.189 
if you don't know what the meaning of
life<00:04:52.169> is<00:04:52.620> you<00:04:52.979> can<00:04:53.310> actually<00:04:53.690> say<00:04:54.690> something

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 
life is you can actually say something

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:57.920 
life is you can actually say something
about<00:04:55.380> what<00:04:55.710> it's<00:04:55.860> not<00:04:56.130> and<00:04:56.690> that's<00:04:57.690> basically

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
about what it's not and that's basically

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.499 
about what it's not and that's basically
I<00:04:58.199> think<00:04:58.650> one<00:04:58.860> of<00:04:58.889> the<00:04:59.070> thrust<00:04:59.370> of<00:04:59.610> of<00:05:00.180> the

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:00.509 
I think one of the thrust of of the

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:02.029 
I think one of the thrust of of the
foundational<00:05:01.020> falsehoods<00:05:01.470> of<00:05:01.590> creationism

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:02.039 
foundational falsehoods of creationism

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:05.080 
foundational falsehoods of creationism
part<00:05:02.400> two<00:05:02.690> is<00:05:03.690> that<00:05:03.960> if<00:05:04.169> there<00:05:04.440> were<00:05:04.680> a<00:05:04.710> god

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
part two is that if there were a god

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:11.960 
part two is that if there were a god
then<00:05:06.090> you<00:05:07.050> would<00:05:07.650> expect<00:05:08.070> the<00:05:10.970> instructions

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
then you would expect the instructions

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.290 
then you would expect the instructions
of<00:05:12.180> this<00:05:12.449> divine<00:05:12.840> being<00:05:13.259> to<00:05:14.070> be<00:05:14.340> universally

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
of this divine being to be universally

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.360 
of this divine being to be universally
understood<00:05:15.330> I'm<00:05:16.080> in<00:05:16.800> the<00:05:17.070> same

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
understood I'm in the same

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.640 
understood I'm in the same
interpretation<00:05:17.820> all<00:05:18.750> throughout<00:05:19.229> the<00:05:19.440> world

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.810 
interpretation all throughout the world
and<00:05:21.949> let<00:05:22.949> me<00:05:23.039> see<00:05:23.220> where<00:05:23.310> i<00:05:23.340> can<00:05:23.430> get<00:05:23.490> me<00:05:23.639> back

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
and let me see where i can get me back

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.249 
and let me see where i can get me back
on<00:05:24.000> the<00:05:24.120> screen<00:05:24.419> of<00:05:24.539> them<00:05:24.660> on<00:05:24.810> there<00:05:25.050> you<00:05:25.169> go

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:25.259 
on the screen of them on there you go

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:29.439 
on the screen of them on there you go
guys<00:05:25.560> um<00:05:25.919> and<00:05:26.880> that's<00:05:27.120> not<00:05:27.509> what<00:05:27.780> you<00:05:27.990> see<00:05:28.199> um

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:29.449 
guys um and that's not what you see um

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:34.670 
guys um and that's not what you see um
and<00:05:30.620> so<00:05:31.620> in<00:05:31.949> that<00:05:32.070> sense<00:05:32.570> the<00:05:33.570> one<00:05:34.500> of<00:05:34.620> the

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
and so in that sense the one of the

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.320 
and so in that sense the one of the
things<00:05:34.889> you<00:05:34.949> can<00:05:35.159> say<00:05:35.190> that<00:05:35.669> the<00:05:35.820> meaning<00:05:36.270> of

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
things you can say that the meaning of

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.140 
things you can say that the meaning of
life<00:05:36.570> is<00:05:36.840> not<00:05:36.870> is<00:05:37.500> based<00:05:38.070> on<00:05:38.310> some<00:05:38.760> sort<00:05:39.120> of

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
life is not is based on some sort of

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.270 
life is not is based on some sort of
divine<00:05:39.650> being<00:05:40.650> like<00:05:41.070> Jesus<00:05:41.849> or<00:05:42.090> Mohammed

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
divine being like Jesus or Mohammed

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.920 
divine being like Jesus or Mohammed
because<00:05:44.280> if<00:05:44.400> it<00:05:44.520> yeah<00:05:44.940> these<00:05:45.120> do<00:05:45.389> not<00:05:45.419> have
