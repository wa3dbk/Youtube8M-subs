shooting film so let's begin now the
first<00:00:28.529> piece<00:00:28.769> of<00:00:28.800> advice<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.429> have<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:29.849> to

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
first piece of advice that I have is to

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.049 
first piece of advice that I have is to
try<00:00:30.359> different<00:00:31.109> films<00:00:31.439> out<00:00:31.619> right<00:00:32.520> now<00:00:32.700> I've

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
try different films out right now I've

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.540 
try different films out right now I've
probably<00:00:33.840> tried<00:00:34.200> around<00:00:34.590> five<00:00:34.860> types<00:00:35.160> of<00:00:35.370> a

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
probably tried around five types of a

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.850 
probably tried around five types of a
film<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.300> they've<00:00:36.600> all<00:00:36.840> been<00:00:36.870> colored<00:00:37.410> so<00:00:37.590> far

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
film and they've all been colored so far

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.700 
film and they've all been colored so far
so<00:00:38.670> I've<00:00:38.910> had<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.360> lot<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.930> different<00:00:40.290> types<00:00:40.590> of

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
so I've had a lot of different types of

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.290 
so I've had a lot of different types of
film<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:41.040> play<00:00:41.160> around<00:00:41.430> with<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.270> reason

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
film to play around with and the reason

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.240 
film to play around with and the reason
why<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:42.719> want<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.110> do<00:00:43.260> this<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:43.590> because<00:00:43.920> film

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
why you want to do this is because film

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.150 
why you want to do this is because film
each<00:00:45.289> film<00:00:46.289> stock<00:00:46.530> has<00:00:46.800> its<00:00:47.010> own

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
each film stock has its own

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.850 
each film stock has its own
characteristics<00:00:47.969> its<00:00:48.149> own<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:49.050> know<00:00:49.140> kind<00:00:49.770> of

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
characteristics its own you know kind of

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.430 
characteristics its own you know kind of
color<00:00:50.190> its<00:00:50.550> own<00:00:50.760> contrast<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.170> want

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
color its own contrast and so you want

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.350 
color its own contrast and so you want
to<00:00:52.590> try<00:00:52.949> these<00:00:53.010> things<00:00:53.190> out<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.579> see<00:00:53.940> what<00:00:54.180> fits

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
to try these things out to see what fits

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.360 
to try these things out to see what fits
your<00:00:54.629> style<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:55.020> shooting<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.440> most<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.829> what

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
your style of shooting the most and what

your style of shooting the most and what
fits<00:00:56.610> specific<00:00:57.600> styles<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.379> shooting<00:00:58.559> over

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
fits specific styles of shooting over

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.439 
fits specific styles of shooting over
the<00:00:59.129> other<00:00:59.309> so<00:00:59.609> there<00:00:59.850> are<00:00:59.910> some<00:01:00.030> films<00:01:00.329> that

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
recommend trying different films the

recommend trying different films the
second<00:01:13.680> piece<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.830> advice<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.400> have<00:01:14.549> to

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
second piece of advice that I have to

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.700 
second piece of advice that I have to
give<00:01:14.820> is<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.479> shoot<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:16.140> lot<00:01:16.320> when<00:01:16.590> you're

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
give is to shoot a lot when you're

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.440 
give is to shoot a lot when you're
starting<00:01:17.070> off<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.430> when<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:17.790> say<00:01:18.030> shoot<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.330> lot

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
starting off and when I say shoot a lot

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.999 
starting off and when I say shoot a lot
I<00:01:18.600> don't<00:01:18.659> mean<00:01:18.869> shoot<00:01:19.170> like<00:01:19.350> 20<00:01:19.619> year<00:01:19.710> olds<00:01:19.890> and

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
I don't mean shoot like 20 year olds and

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.140 
I don't mean shoot like 20 year olds and
then<00:01:20.100> develop<00:01:20.460> those<00:01:20.610> at<00:01:20.790> once

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
then develop those at once

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.190 
then develop those at once
I<00:01:21.180> mean<00:01:21.860> shooting<00:01:22.860> one<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.280> two<00:01:23.490> rolls<00:01:23.729> and

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
I mean shooting one to two rolls and

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.929 
I mean shooting one to two rolls and
taking<00:01:25.200> note<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.650> what<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.070> shot<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.850> then

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
taking note of what you shot and then

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.640 
taking note of what you shot and then
developing<00:01:27.450> those<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.689> then<00:01:27.990> viewing<00:01:28.530> your

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
developing those and then viewing your

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.280 
developing those and then viewing your
images<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:29.340> see<00:01:29.820> if<00:01:30.030> they<00:01:30.210> came<00:01:30.479> out<00:01:30.509> how<00:01:31.229> you

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
images to see if they came out how you

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.499 
images to see if they came out how you
wanted<00:01:31.680> them<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.040> or<00:01:32.070> if<00:01:32.610> not<00:01:32.880> what<00:01:33.180> changes

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
wanted them to or if not what changes

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.899 
wanted them to or if not what changes
you<00:01:33.659> can<00:01:33.780> make<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:34.280> make<00:01:35.280> them<00:01:35.460> come<00:01:35.670> out<00:01:35.700> the

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
you can make to make them come out the

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.280 
you can make to make them come out the
way<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.060> want<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.509> then<00:01:36.720> shoot<00:01:36.960> another

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
way you want to and then shoot another

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.719 
way you want to and then shoot another
two<00:01:37.530> rolls<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:37.979> then<00:01:38.250> see<00:01:38.490> if<00:01:38.579> you've

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
two rolls and then see if you've

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.670 
two rolls and then see if you've
corrected<00:01:39.240> those<00:01:39.360> changes<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.320> then<00:01:40.530> shoot

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
corrected those changes and then shoot

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.740 
corrected those changes and then shoot
another<00:01:40.950> two<00:01:41.220> rolls<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:42.000> on<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:42.420> forth

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
another two rolls and so on and so forth

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.660 
another two rolls and so on and so forth
and<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.470> that<00:01:43.680> way<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:43.890> can<00:01:44.130> really<00:01:44.340> learn<00:01:44.640> how

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
and so that way you can really learn how

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.789 
and so that way you can really learn how
your<00:01:45.000> camera<00:01:45.390> works<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.290> can<00:01:46.320> analyze

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
your camera works and you can analyze

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.560 
your camera works and you can analyze
your<00:01:46.950> image<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.640> when<00:01:48.030> you're<00:01:48.149> taking<00:01:48.479> an

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
your image so that when you're taking an

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.359 
your image so that when you're taking an
image<00:01:48.750> it's<00:01:49.049> not<00:01:49.259> totally<00:01:49.770> random<00:01:49.920> it's<00:01:50.310> a

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
image it's not totally random it's a

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.889 
image it's not totally random it's a
little<00:01:50.579> bit<00:01:50.670> more<00:01:50.820> predictable<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.659> sort

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
little bit more predictable and you sort

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.660 
little bit more predictable and you sort
of<00:01:51.960> know<00:01:52.170> what's<00:01:52.710> going<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.009> happen<00:01:53.369> in<00:01:53.520> terms

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
of know what's going to happen in terms

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.630 
of know what's going to happen in terms
of<00:01:53.820> exposure<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:55.320> all<00:01:55.439> that<00:01:55.619> stuff<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.610> other

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
of exposure and all that stuff the other

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.340 
of exposure and all that stuff the other
benefit<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.360> shooting<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.810> lot<00:01:57.990> when<00:01:58.229> you're

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
benefit to shooting a lot when you're

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.660 
benefit to shooting a lot when you're
first<00:01:58.469> starting<00:01:58.590> off<00:01:58.890> is<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.340> get<00:01:59.610> more

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
first starting off is that you get more

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.469 
first starting off is that you get more
comfortable<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:01.680> don't<00:02:01.920> get<00:02:02.640> too<00:02:03.090> scared

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
comfortable and you don't get too scared

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.420 
comfortable and you don't get too scared
to<00:02:03.689> shoot<00:02:03.899> when<00:02:04.439> I<00:02:04.469> first<00:02:04.740> started<00:02:05.009> off<00:02:05.159> I<00:02:05.369> was

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
to shoot when I first started off I was

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.449 
to shoot when I first started off I was
scared<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.210> shoot<00:02:06.420> because<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.500> didn't<00:02:08.039> know

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
scared to shoot because I didn't know

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.309 
scared to shoot because I didn't know
how<00:02:08.759> my<00:02:08.940> images<00:02:09.330> were<00:02:09.479> going<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.840> come<00:02:09.989> out<00:02:10.080> but

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
how my images were going to come out but

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.050 
how my images were going to come out but
the<00:02:10.410> more<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.679> shoot<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:11.310> more<00:02:11.489> confident

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
the more you shoot the more confident

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.370 
the more you shoot the more confident
that<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.450> get<00:02:12.629> and<00:02:12.840> the

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
that you get and the

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.500 
that you get and the
the<00:02:14.040> less<00:02:14.310> you<00:02:14.610> think<00:02:14.880> about<00:02:15.090> you<00:02:15.450> know

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510

to<00:03:02.190> when<00:03:02.460> it's<00:03:02.610> a<00:03:02.670> print<00:03:02.970> and<00:03:03.210> I<00:03:03.540> don't<00:03:04.170> wet

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
to when it's a print and I don't wet

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.890 
to when it's a print and I don't wet
print<00:03:04.890> I've<00:03:04.980> never<00:03:05.220> wet<00:03:05.850> printed<00:03:06.330> but<00:03:06.570> I<00:03:06.630> try

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
print I've never wet printed but I try

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.840 
print I've never wet printed but I try
to<00:03:06.930> include<00:03:07.440> myself<00:03:07.650> in<00:03:08.010> as<00:03:08.280> much<00:03:08.520> of<00:03:08.580> the

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
to include myself in as much of the

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.000 
to include myself in as much of the
process<00:03:09.060> as<00:03:09.390> I<00:03:09.600> can<00:03:09.840> and<00:03:10.080> I<00:03:10.470> haven't<00:03:10.800> developed

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
process as I can and I haven't developed

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.430 
process as I can and I haven't developed
a<00:03:11.250> lot<00:03:11.400> of<00:03:11.520> film<00:03:11.700> but<00:03:11.940> next<00:03:12.450> quarter<00:03:12.900> I'm

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
a lot of film but next quarter I'm

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.230 
a lot of film but next quarter I'm
taking<00:03:14.010> a<00:03:14.100> class<00:03:14.280> which<00:03:14.550> will<00:03:14.730> require<00:03:14.970> me<00:03:15.210> to

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
taking a class which will require me to

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.540 
taking a class which will require me to
develop<00:03:15.660> a<00:03:15.720> lot<00:03:15.870> of<00:03:15.960> film<00:03:16.140> so<00:03:16.560> I<00:03:16.950> hope<00:03:17.340> that

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
develop a lot of film so I hope that

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.540 
develop a lot of film so I hope that
really<00:03:17.730> you<00:03:17.910> know<00:03:18.000> pushes<00:03:18.390> me<00:03:18.540> to<00:03:18.720> be<00:03:18.750> a<00:03:19.560> bigger

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
really you know pushes me to be a bigger

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.460 
really you know pushes me to be a bigger
part<00:03:20.820> of<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:20.970> process<00:03:21.390> and<00:03:21.540> hopefully<00:03:21.960> it<00:03:22.170> you

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
part of the process and hopefully it you

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.870 
part of the process and hopefully it you
know<00:03:22.590> encourages<00:03:23.010> me<00:03:23.160> to<00:03:23.280> develop<00:03:23.520> more<00:03:23.640> film

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
know encourages me to develop more film

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.400 
know encourages me to develop more film
in<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.090> future<00:03:24.390> and<00:03:24.660> I<00:03:24.810> also<00:03:24.930> encourage<00:03:25.380> you

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
in the future and I also encourage you

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.200 
in the future and I also encourage you
guys<00:03:25.710> to<00:03:25.950> learn<00:03:26.280> how<00:03:26.490> to<00:03:26.520> develop<00:03:26.760> your<00:03:27.060> own

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 
guys to learn how to develop your own

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:28.880 
guys to learn how to develop your own
film<00:03:27.450> the<00:03:27.930> fourth<00:03:28.200> piece<00:03:28.380> of<00:03:28.530> advice<00:03:28.770> I<00:03:28.800> have

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
film the fourth piece of advice I have

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.680 
film the fourth piece of advice I have
to<00:03:29.010> give<00:03:29.190> is<00:03:29.340> to<00:03:29.370> find<00:03:29.760> a<00:03:29.910> good<00:03:30.120> lab<00:03:30.300> to<00:03:30.540> develop

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
to give is to find a good lab to develop

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.270 
to give is to find a good lab to develop
your<00:03:30.990> film<00:03:31.170> if<00:03:31.350> you're<00:03:31.470> not<00:03:31.620> developing<00:03:32.130> it<00:03:32.220> to

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
your film if you're not developing it to

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.210 
your film if you're not developing it to
yourself<00:03:32.670> and<00:03:33.420> to<00:03:33.960> develop<00:03:34.410> it<00:03:34.530> and<00:03:34.620> also<00:03:35.070> to

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
yourself and to develop it and also to

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.770 
yourself and to develop it and also to
stand<00:03:35.580> it<00:03:35.700> if<00:03:35.790> you're<00:03:35.940> also<00:03:36.090> not<00:03:36.330> scanning<00:03:36.690> it

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
stand it if you're also not scanning it

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.460 
stand it if you're also not scanning it
to<00:03:36.990> about<00:03:37.620> yourself<00:03:38.040> because<00:03:39.290> developing<00:03:40.290> is

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
to about yourself because developing is

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.170 
to about yourself because developing is
a<00:03:40.500> big<00:03:40.830> part<00:03:41.130> of<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.310> process<00:03:41.730> you<00:03:41.760> could<00:03:42.030> have

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
a big part of the process you could have

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.960 
a big part of the process you could have
taken<00:03:42.450> a<00:03:42.750> really<00:03:43.080> nice<00:03:43.470> picture<00:03:43.860> and<00:03:44.280> the

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
taken a really nice picture and the

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.550 
taken a really nice picture and the
exposure<00:03:45.270> could<00:03:45.540> have<00:03:45.630> been<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:45.900> bang<00:03:46.080> on<00:03:46.290> but

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
exposure could have been and bang on but

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.230 
exposure could have been and bang on but
if<00:03:46.680> you<00:03:46.800> don't<00:03:46.980> develop<00:03:47.250> it<00:03:47.490> correctly<00:03:47.820> it's

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.240 
if you don't develop it correctly it's

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.020 
if you don't develop it correctly it's
not<00:03:48.390> going<00:03:48.780> to<00:03:48.870> come<00:03:49.020> out<00:03:49.220> correctly<00:03:50.220> and<00:03:50.460> so

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
not going to come out correctly and so

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.800 
not going to come out correctly and so
you<00:03:51.090> want<00:03:51.450> to<00:03:51.600> spend<00:03:52.440> time<00:03:53.430> and<00:03:53.760> money<00:03:54.420> looking

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
you want to spend time and money looking

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.620 
you want to spend time and money looking
for<00:03:55.230> a<00:03:55.800> lab<00:03:56.580> that<00:03:56.610> you're<00:03:57.150> comfortable<00:03:57.360> with

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
for a lab that you're comfortable with

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.810 
for a lab that you're comfortable with
when<00:03:58.200> I'm<00:03:58.320> back<00:03:58.500> home<00:03:58.530> I<00:03:58.890> found<00:03:59.160> a<00:03:59.370> good<00:03:59.610> lab

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
when I'm back home I found a good lab

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.180 
when I'm back home I found a good lab
it's<00:04:00.060> a<00:04:00.120> kodak<00:04:00.450> lab<00:04:00.660> that<00:04:01.350> sends<00:04:01.710> it<00:04:01.770> out<00:04:01.890> to

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
it's a kodak lab that sends it out to

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.850 
it's a kodak lab that sends it out to
another<00:04:03.000> lab<00:04:03.480> to<00:04:03.720> get<00:04:03.990> my<00:04:04.110> film<00:04:04.350> developed<00:04:04.710> and

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
another lab to get my film developed and

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.490 
another lab to get my film developed and
when<00:04:04.980> I'm<00:04:05.100> at<00:04:05.220> school<00:04:05.390> the<00:04:06.390> school<00:04:06.720> has<00:04:06.990> a<00:04:07.020> lab

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
when I'm at school the school has a lab

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.170 
when I'm at school the school has a lab
and<00:04:07.800> you<00:04:07.890> just<00:04:08.040> have<00:04:08.190> to<00:04:08.280> pay<00:04:08.400> for<00:04:08.460> a<00:04:08.640> lab<00:04:09.000> fee

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
and you just have to pay for a lab fee

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.820 
and you just have to pay for a lab fee
and<00:04:09.390> they<00:04:09.840> get<00:04:09.990> it<00:04:10.110> done<00:04:10.140> pretty<00:04:10.440> good<00:04:10.650> and

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
and they get it done pretty good and

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.010 
and they get it done pretty good and
then<00:04:10.950> I<00:04:11.010> just<00:04:11.190> scan<00:04:11.400> my<00:04:11.550> own<00:04:11.670> film<00:04:11.910> so<00:04:12.120> I've

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
then I just scan my own film so I've

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.440 
then I just scan my own film so I've
also<00:04:13.290> developed<00:04:13.980> in<00:04:14.250> in<00:04:14.580> some<00:04:14.910> drug<00:04:15.150> stores

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
also developed in in some drug stores

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.560 
also developed in in some drug stores
like<00:04:15.720> CVS<00:04:16.470> and<00:04:17.010> it's<00:04:17.430> not<00:04:17.700> come<00:04:18.030> out<00:04:18.060> really

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
like CVS and it's not come out really

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.860 
like CVS and it's not come out really
good<00:04:18.870> and<00:04:19.080> that's<00:04:19.560> you<00:04:20.040> know<00:04:20.130> it's<00:04:20.430> really

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
good and that's you know it's really

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.680 
good and that's you know it's really
unmotivated<00:04:21.870> when<00:04:22.440> you<00:04:22.830> see<00:04:23.100> bad<00:04:23.970> results<00:04:24.540> in

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
unmotivated when you see bad results in

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.780 
unmotivated when you see bad results in
terms<00:04:24.840> of<00:04:25.050> the<00:04:25.350> pictures<00:04:25.800> that<00:04:25.830> you<00:04:26.010> take<00:04:26.190> take

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
terms of the pictures that you take take

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:27.920 
terms of the pictures that you take take
but<00:04:27.180> sometimes

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
but sometimes

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.270 
but sometimes
just<00:04:28.199> because<00:04:28.410> of<00:04:28.500> the<00:04:28.590> lab<00:04:28.800> that<00:04:29.009> you<00:04:29.100> didn't

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
just because of the lab that you didn't

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.430 
just because of the lab that you didn't
develop<00:04:29.850> it<00:04:30.060> in<00:04:30.210> so<00:04:30.419> try<00:04:30.750> different<00:04:31.050> labs<00:04:31.229> to

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
develop it in so try different labs to

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.430 
develop it in so try different labs to
see<00:04:31.650> which<00:04:32.310> one<00:04:32.550> does<00:04:33.000> the<00:04:33.030> best<00:04:33.210> job<00:04:33.479> and<00:04:33.930> also

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
see which one does the best job and also

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.779 
see which one does the best job and also
for<00:04:34.620> a<00:04:34.650> good<00:04:34.680> price<00:04:35.039> so<00:04:35.250> that's<00:04:35.430> my<00:04:35.580> first

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:35.789 
for a good price so that's my first

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:37.850 
for a good price so that's my first
piece<00:04:36.030> of<00:04:36.060> advice<00:04:36.289> developing<00:04:37.289> is<00:04:37.410> a<00:04:37.440> big<00:04:37.680> part
