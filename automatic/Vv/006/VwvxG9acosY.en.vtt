what<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.619> want<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.830> really<00:01:20.009> go<00:01:20.130> over<00:01:20.159> is<00:01:20.460> the

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
what I want to really go over is the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.570 
what I want to really go over is the
practical<00:01:21.150> reasons<00:01:21.570> as<00:01:21.720> an<00:01:22.380> installer<00:01:23.100> from

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
practical reasons as an installer from

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.300 
practical reasons as an installer from
that<00:01:23.759> point<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.150> view<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.450> why<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.170> dura<00:01:25.920> tack

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
that point of view of why the dura tack

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.700 
that point of view of why the dura tack
is<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:27.030> nice<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.390> work<00:01:27.420> with<00:01:27.750> so<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.470> first

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
is so nice to work with so the first

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.410 
is so nice to work with so the first
thing<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.070> that<00:01:29.100> dur<00:01:29.490> tech<00:01:29.759> has<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.000> two<00:01:30.270> inch

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
thing is that dur tech has a two inch

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.660 
thing is that dur tech has a two inch
clearance<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.990> combustibles<00:01:31.140> now<00:01:32.100> that's

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
clearance to combustibles now that's

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.420 
clearance to combustibles now that's
pretty<00:01:32.909> standard<00:01:33.180> in<00:01:33.540> high<00:01:33.720> temperature<00:01:34.430> pipe

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
pretty standard in high temperature pipe

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.569 
pretty standard in high temperature pipe
but<00:01:36.119> what<00:01:36.869> isn't<00:01:37.170> standard<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.369> has<00:01:38.549> a

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
but what isn't standard is that it has a

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.690 
but what isn't standard is that it has a
one-inch<00:01:39.420> thick<00:01:39.900> wall<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.220> can<00:01:41.369> see<00:01:41.549> it's

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
one-inch thick wall and you can see it's

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.210 
one-inch thick wall and you can see it's
a<00:01:41.790> it's<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.150> double<00:01:42.600> wall<00:01:42.810> pipe<00:01:43.070> it's<00:01:44.070> got<00:01:44.189> a

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
a it's a double wall pipe it's got a

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.760 
a it's a double wall pipe it's got a
one-inch<00:01:44.759> thick<00:01:45.030> wall<00:01:45.329> now<00:01:46.229> when<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.530> compare

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
one-inch thick wall now when you compare

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.310 
one-inch thick wall now when you compare
that<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.909> triple<00:01:48.299> wall<00:01:48.600> pipe<00:01:48.869> which<00:01:49.110> would

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
that to a triple wall pipe which would

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.770 
that to a triple wall pipe which would
have<00:01:49.470> another<00:01:49.860> layer<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.759> pipe<00:01:51.180> around<00:01:51.360> it

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
have another layer of pipe around it

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.990 
have another layer of pipe around it
with<00:01:51.960> an<00:01:52.110> air<00:01:52.380> insulation<00:01:53.070> in<00:01:53.220> there<00:01:53.430> you

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
with an air insulation in there you

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.179 
with an air insulation in there you
really<00:01:54.390> expand<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.079> diameter<00:01:55.380> the

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
really expand to the diameter the

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.069 
really expand to the diameter the
benefit<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.000> double<00:01:57.329> wall<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.930> that

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
benefit to the double wall and that

and you're penetrating that instead of

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.880 
and you're penetrating that instead of

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
the duratec double wall pipe can

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.250 
the duratec double wall pipe can
typically<00:02:21.030> go<00:02:21.209> right<00:02:21.480> through<00:02:21.690> those<00:02:21.840> joists

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
typically go right through those joists

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.070 
typically go right through those joists
and<00:02:22.970> that<00:02:23.970> just<00:02:24.150> means<00:02:24.270> less<00:02:24.600> time<00:02:24.780> in<00:02:24.990> the

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
and that just means less time in the

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.809 
and that just means less time in the
attic<00:02:25.470> less<00:02:25.740> time<00:02:25.980> modifying<00:02:26.490> your<00:02:26.580> home

structure<00:02:27.300> and<00:02:27.480> I<00:02:27.930> just<00:02:28.140> feel<00:02:28.260> that<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.500> be<00:02:28.590> a

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
structure and I just feel that to be a

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.410 
structure and I just feel that to be a
big<00:02:28.830> benefit<00:02:29.310> for<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:30.090> dura<00:02:30.300> tack<00:02:31.940> the<00:02:32.940> the

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
big benefit for the dura tack the the

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.060 
big benefit for the dura tack the the
second<00:02:33.750> reason<00:02:33.870> that<00:02:34.170> I<00:02:34.350> really<00:02:34.620> like<00:02:34.800> der

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
second reason that I really like der

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.140 
second reason that I really like der
attack<00:02:35.340> is<00:02:35.490> that<00:02:35.610> it<00:02:35.700> doesn't<00:02:35.850> have<00:02:36.000> any

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
attack is that it doesn't have any

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.640 
attack is that it doesn't have any
locking<00:02:36.480> bands<00:02:36.840> it<00:02:36.990> doesn't<00:02:37.230> require<00:02:37.410> them

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
locking bands it doesn't require them

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.040 
locking bands it doesn't require them
it's<00:02:38.160> got<00:02:38.340> this<00:02:38.490> twist<00:02:38.880> lock<00:02:39.180> connection

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
it's got this twist lock connection

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.110 
it's got this twist lock connection
which<00:02:40.200> most<00:02:40.530> high<00:02:41.070> temperature<00:02:41.550> pipes<00:02:41.820> have

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
which most high temperature pipes have

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.680 
which most high temperature pipes have
however<00:02:43.400> duratec<00:02:44.400> is<00:02:44.610> rated<00:02:45.300> so<00:02:45.450> that<00:02:45.600> you

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
however duratec is rated so that you

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.810 
however duratec is rated so that you
don't<00:02:45.930> have<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.470> install<00:02:46.709> locking<00:02:47.310> bands<00:02:47.520> and

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
don't have to install locking bands and

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.120 
don't have to install locking bands and
it's<00:02:48.750> not<00:02:48.959> really<00:02:49.140> a<00:02:49.260> big<00:02:49.470> deal

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
it's not really a big deal

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.920 
it's not really a big deal
however<00:02:50.700> you<00:02:50.970> know<00:02:51.090> locking<00:02:51.450> bands<00:02:51.660> cost

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
however you know locking bands cost

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.150 
however you know locking bands cost
around<00:02:52.110> $10<00:02:52.680> a<00:02:52.709> piece

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
around $10 a piece

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.949 
around $10 a piece
so<00:02:53.550> if<00:02:53.640> you've<00:02:53.790> got<00:02:53.820> three<00:02:54.180> seams<00:02:54.570> in<00:02:54.840> your

so if you've got three seams in your

so if you've got three seams in your
installation<00:02:55.230> you're<00:02:55.590> gonna<00:02:55.680> need<00:02:55.890> you<00:02:56.220> know

spend<00:02:56.550> about<00:02:56.760> thirty<00:02:57.000> dollars<00:02:57.330> in<00:02:57.510> locking

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
spend about thirty dollars in locking

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.240 
spend about thirty dollars in locking
bands<00:02:58.050> if<00:02:58.500> you've<00:02:58.620> got<00:02:58.769> ten<00:02:59.040> you're<00:02:59.160> gonna

breathing thing that moves all the time
and<00:04:26.490> so

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
and so

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.570 
and so
just<00:04:27.599> to<00:04:27.689> have<00:04:27.900> that<00:04:28.110> extra<00:04:28.259> security<00:04:29.039> of<00:04:29.370> an

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
extra thick inner wall it it makes me

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.429 
extra thick inner wall it it makes me
sleep<00:04:32.789> better<00:04:32.969> knowing<00:04:33.210> that<00:04:33.419> I've<00:04:34.169> got<00:04:34.199> a

00:04:34.429 --> 00:04:34.439 
sleep better knowing that I've got a

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:38.659 
sleep better knowing that I've got a
nice<00:04:35.099> high-quality<00:04:35.550> pipe<00:04:36.210> installed<00:04:37.669> the

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
nice high-quality pipe installed the

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:40.760 
nice high-quality pipe installed the
fourth<00:04:39.180> reason<00:04:39.360> that<00:04:39.659> I<00:04:39.719> like<00:04:39.990> the<00:04:40.229> dura<00:04:40.439> tack

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
fourth reason that I like the dura tack

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.659 
fourth reason that I like the dura tack
is<00:04:41.039> that<00:04:41.990> it's<00:04:42.990> the<00:04:43.199> only<00:04:43.669> high-temperature

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
is that it's the only high-temperature

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:47.360 
is that it's the only high-temperature
chimney<00:04:45.150> system<00:04:45.330> that's<00:04:46.080> available<00:04:46.409> in<00:04:46.979> five

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
chimney system that's available in five

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.540 
chimney system that's available in five
foot<00:04:47.639> lengths<00:04:47.969> that<00:04:48.120> I'm<00:04:48.210> aware<00:04:48.479> of<00:04:48.539> and<00:04:48.900> so

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
foot lengths that I'm aware of and so

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.249 
foot lengths that I'm aware of and so
five<00:04:50.550> foot<00:04:50.789> lengths<00:04:51.120> simply<00:04:51.479> means<00:04:51.689> less

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:52.259 
five foot lengths simply means less

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:54.110 
five foot lengths simply means less
pieces<00:04:52.499> of<00:04:52.770> pipe<00:04:52.949> I've<00:04:53.430> got<00:04:53.639> a<00:04:53.669> ship<00:04:53.939> less

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
pieces of pipe I've got a ship less

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.550 
pieces of pipe I've got a ship less
pieces<00:04:54.479> of<00:04:54.599> pipe<00:04:54.779> you<00:04:55.110> know<00:04:55.139> I've<00:04:55.409> got<00:04:55.529> a

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
pieces of pipe you know I've got a

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.709 
pieces of pipe you know I've got a
handle<00:04:55.979> less<00:04:56.129> pieces<00:04:56.460> of<00:04:56.550> pipe<00:04:56.729> it's<00:04:57.180> one<00:04:57.509> less

00:04:57.709 --> 00:04:57.719 
handle less pieces of pipe it's one less

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:59.959 
handle less pieces of pipe it's one less
trip<00:04:58.020> up<00:04:58.169> the<00:04:58.319> ladder<00:04:58.560> or<00:04:58.919> one<00:04:59.400> less<00:04:59.580> trip<00:04:59.819> up

00:04:59.959 --> 00:04:59.969 
trip up the ladder or one less trip up

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:01.100 
trip up the ladder or one less trip up
into<00:05:00.240> the<00:05:00.330> crawl<00:05:00.539> space

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
into the crawl space

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.420 
into the crawl space
I'm<00:05:01.800> sorry<00:05:02.069> attic<00:05:03.169> it's<00:05:04.169> a<00:05:04.319> one<00:05:04.710> less<00:05:04.949> seam

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
I'm sorry attic it's a one less seam

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.209 
I'm sorry attic it's a one less seam
potentially<00:05:06.270> in<00:05:06.449> my<00:05:06.569> installation<00:05:06.900> so<00:05:07.650> the

00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:08.219 
potentially in my installation so the

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:10.820 
potentially in my installation so the
versatility<00:05:08.639> of<00:05:08.879> having<00:05:09.360> that<00:05:09.650> five<00:05:10.650> foot

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
versatility of having that five foot

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.890 
versatility of having that five foot
length<00:05:11.069> is<00:05:11.250> pretty<00:05:11.490> nice<00:05:11.699> and<00:05:12.090> and<00:05:12.389> as<00:05:12.779> an

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
length is pretty nice and and as an

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.029 
length is pretty nice and and as an
installer<00:05:13.349> you'll<00:05:14.009> appreciate<00:05:14.550> that<00:05:16.039> the

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 
installer you'll appreciate that the

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:19.670 
installer you'll appreciate that the
last<00:05:17.279> reason<00:05:17.550> that<00:05:17.969> I<00:05:18.240> choose<00:05:18.750> dura<00:05:19.080> tack<00:05:19.409> is

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
last reason that I choose dura tack is

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.070 
last reason that I choose dura tack is
that<00:05:20.219> it<00:05:20.339> has<00:05:20.490> a<00:05:20.520> really<00:05:21.029> wide<00:05:21.449> range<00:05:21.509> of

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
that it has a really wide range of

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.140 
that it has a really wide range of
components<00:05:22.520> everything<00:05:23.520> from<00:05:25.009> black<00:05:26.009> pipe<00:05:26.669> so

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
components everything from black pipe so

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.959 
components everything from black pipe so
if<00:05:27.270> you<00:05:27.360> have<00:05:27.509> to<00:05:27.689> bring<00:05:28.080> a<00:05:28.789> double<00:05:29.789> wall<00:05:29.939> pipe

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:29.969 
if you have to bring a double wall pipe

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:32.659 
if you have to bring a double wall pipe
into<00:05:30.509> a<00:05:31.169> living<00:05:31.710> space<00:05:31.919> for<00:05:32.219> some<00:05:32.370> reason

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
into a living space for some reason

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:34.159 
into a living space for some reason
maybe<00:05:32.879> because<00:05:33.000> you<00:05:33.330> have<00:05:33.449> a<00:05:33.479> close<00:05:33.719> clearance

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:34.169 
maybe because you have a close clearance

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:36.740 
maybe because you have a close clearance
to<00:05:34.409> a<00:05:34.680> wall<00:05:35.580> or<00:05:35.849> ceiling<00:05:36.000> or<00:05:36.240> something<00:05:36.539> and

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:38.909 
you've got to bring that into the room

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:41.149 
you've got to bring that into the room
it's<00:05:39.180> got<00:05:39.419> pre<00:05:39.689> black<00:05:40.199> painted<00:05:40.680> pipe<00:05:40.889> and
