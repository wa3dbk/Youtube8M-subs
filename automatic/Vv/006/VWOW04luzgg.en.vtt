00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.670 
quite firm it's not overcooked
then<00:03:45.400> it's<00:03:45.639> delicately<00:03:46.150> I<00:03:46.269> must<00:03:46.629> lift<00:03:47.229> out<00:03:47.470> the

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
then it's delicately I must lift out the

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.009 
then it's delicately I must lift out the
bass<00:03:47.889> I<00:03:48.099> don't<00:03:48.280> want<00:03:48.430> to<00:03:48.519> break<00:03:48.729> thee<00:03:49.060> I<00:03:49.329> might

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
bass I don't want to break thee I might

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.170 
bass I don't want to break thee I might
break<00:03:50.319> the<00:03:50.500> fish<00:03:50.680> a<00:03:50.709> little<00:03:50.889> bit<00:03:51.099> but<00:03:52.030> it

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
break the fish a little bit but it

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.059 
break the fish a little bit but it
doesn't<00:03:52.540> matter<00:03:52.810> too<00:03:53.139> much<00:03:53.169> it's<00:03:53.709> a<00:03:53.769> little

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
doesn't matter too much it's a little

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:55.680 
doesn't matter too much it's a little
bit<00:03:54.220> broken<00:03:54.819> but<00:03:55.000> I<00:03:55.180> don't<00:03:55.389> think<00:03:55.479> it<00:03:55.629> will

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
bit broken but I don't think it will

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.469 
bit broken but I don't think it will
impair<00:03:56.019> the<00:03:56.199> flavour<00:03:56.440> and<00:03:56.799> then<00:03:57.519> we'll<00:03:58.389> get

00:03:58.469 --> 00:03:58.479 
impair the flavour and then we'll get

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:03.250 
impair the flavour and then we'll get
this<00:03:58.659> beautiful<00:03:59.139> longest<00:03:59.739> e<00:03:59.889> note
