 3-4 cups a day or more but most 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:22.369
 of people do not think of it as a 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.769
 healthy drink and consume it from a 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.019

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.129

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:38.870
 most important to maximize the 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.269
 coffee benefits and minimize what 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.739
 negative first in the first place is 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:47.660
 necessary to avoid using refined sugar or 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:50.239
 artificial sweeteners instead of 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.269
 sugar uses a very small touch of 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:57.160
 organic maple syrup stevia natural 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:01:00.700
 some of those luxury coffee drinks 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:04.140
 and other coffee shops can have 300 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:06.490
 400 calories in one way 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.340
 It is definitely not good for your 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.250
 body or your blood sugar this 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:15.190
 elevates insulin levels second 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.690
 that you should also try to avoid all 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.600
 coast some of those creams 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.610
 artificial liquid or powder is made 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.270
 usually with syrup solids 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.220
 corn and hydrogenated oils 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.470
 harmful trans fats in place 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.410
 use a little bit of real milk 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:35.170
 coconut milk creamy coconut milk is 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:38.320
 the healthiest option and I recommend you 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.180
 for the third coffee cream if you want 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.380
 load the coffee with more antioxidants 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:46.479
 healthy adds cinnamon to your coffee 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.210
 also sometimes you can add a 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.009
 teaspoon organic cocoa powder 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.289
 not sugary last is very 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.960
 important to go organic coffee beans 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:58.150
 since conventional coffees are 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.450
 treated with pesticides and has 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.820
 a chronic exposure to our gene 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.550
 which also causes fat 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.310
 abdominal in both sets these things so 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.740
 small spoils even all 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:16.530
 a diet to lose weight remember 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.530
