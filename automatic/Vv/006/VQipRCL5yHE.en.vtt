00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.370

 I'm really super happy because 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.180
 As I told you in the video, it's happened 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.709

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.140
 surprises that I bring you a recipe 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:20.480
 very rich and as the title says here 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.580
 down is a sweet pizza this is 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.530
 super easy to do everyone what 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.030
 can make and I'm sure the ingredients 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.190
 you have them in your house and if not 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.320
 you find in the store or in the 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.580
 mercadito so what do you think if we go 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.170
 to see the ingredients that we are going to 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.170
 to keep watching is cheap 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.770
 let's put a little butter 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.370
 obviously with this super brother 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.370
 clean 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.530
 with a little bit as you can see 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.640
 let's let it melt 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.710
 and then we are going to put our tortilla 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.710
 Of flour 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.979
 if they are hit, they will get married 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.050
 since we let it expand a little bit 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.820
 our tortilla is this super patient 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:32.780
 easy the truth anyone can 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:35.820
 do let's put our cream on 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:39.850
 hazelnuts with cocoa 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.900
 We're going to use it 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.900
 to our tortilla 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:53.270
 as if it were the sauce 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:55.429
 of our pizzas but let's go 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.380
 to decorate our pizza we are going to 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:59.850
 occupy the banana your cúper case 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.740
 any fruit that you like 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.680
 I really like the paternal and 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.740
 combines super well with cocoa butter 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.050
 and hazelnuts 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.310
 with a knife very carefully 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.310
 to cut slices 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.360
 simulating as if they were to programs 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.360
 salami 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.970
 since we have super well assembled 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.610
 our flour tortilla in the cream 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.260
 with abellán and cacao is super sweet if you 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.420
 love the sweet because if you mess 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.150
 very much but with a little bit that 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.040
 put and the unt is super well this if 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.250
 you feel 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.840
 to decorate it as we already did 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:48.879
 we cut the slices and the lows 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.879
 to accommodate 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.150
 ah 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:05.670
 and then this is optional decorate it with 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:08.569
 sweet rolls 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.569
 vargas 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.840
 a little bit because then I eat a lot 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.840

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.239
 and sometimes safe 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.420
