and<00:01:51.399> we're<00:01:51.549> going<00:01:51.759> to<00:01:51.850> look<00:01:51.939> at<00:01:52.030> making<00:01:52.359> a<00:01:52.539> size

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
and we're going to look at making a size

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.609 
and we're going to look at making a size
seven<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:54.310> will<00:01:54.520> take<00:01:54.729> that<00:01:55.000> and<00:01:55.509> wrap<00:01:56.439> it

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
seven you will take that and wrap it

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:03.149 
seven you will take that and wrap it
around<00:01:56.679> your<00:01:57.099> ring<00:01:57.310> sizer<00:02:01.799> using<00:02:02.799> the<00:02:02.920> force

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
around your ring sizer using the force

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.139 
around your ring sizer using the force
of<00:02:03.340> your<00:02:03.369> hands<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:06.189> get<00:02:06.340> it<00:02:06.459> to<00:02:06.579> that<00:02:06.610> seven

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
of your hands to get it to that seven

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.979 
of your hands to get it to that seven
point<00:02:07.769> make<00:02:08.769> a<00:02:08.799> loop<00:02:09.129> underneath<00:02:09.819> come<00:02:10.810> back

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
point make a loop underneath come back

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:16.380 
point make a loop underneath come back
up<00:02:12.900> again<00:02:13.900> make<00:02:14.260> it<00:02:14.410> to<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.650> seven<00:02:14.980> point<00:02:15.390> you

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
up again make it to the seven point you

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:23.069 
up again make it to the seven point you
can<00:02:16.599> add<00:02:16.720> your<00:02:16.870> loop<00:02:17.110> again<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:21.870> we'll<00:02:22.870> make

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:23.079 
can add your loop again and we'll make

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:25.740 
can add your loop again and we'll make
it<00:02:23.110> as<00:02:23.349> a<00:02:23.379> to<00:02:23.680> ring<00:02:23.890> segment<00:02:24.420> remove<00:02:25.420> your<00:02:25.569> wing
