slightly<00:02:28.440> different<00:02:28.680> manner<00:02:29.100> today<00:02:29.340> so<00:02:29.519> you

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
slightly different manner today so you

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.440 
slightly different manner today so you

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
change the pot around let me know if

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.199 
change the pot around let me know if
it's<00:02:36.360> too<00:02:36.560> distracting

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
it's too distracting

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.300 
it's too distracting
but<00:02:39.209> let's<00:02:39.440> let's<00:02:40.440> get<00:02:40.620> going<00:02:40.860> as<00:02:40.950> we<00:02:41.070> go<00:02:41.220> up

machine so if you're using a single

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.530 
machine so if you're using a single
ticket<00:03:12.190> and<00:03:12.340> you<00:03:12.489> didn't<00:03:12.790> pay<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.060> proper

amount<00:03:13.950> you<00:03:14.950> can<00:03:15.220> use<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:15.909> net<00:03:16.090> so

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379 
amount you can use the net so

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:20.250

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:23.409 
and this is a slightly different one so

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:26.539 
and this is a slightly different one so
let's<00:03:23.709> see<00:03:23.860> how<00:03:23.980> much<00:03:24.129> money<00:03:24.790> I<00:03:24.879> have<00:03:25.090> left

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:18.060 
so overall the boon done extension
really<00:06:15.580> isn't<00:06:15.940> that<00:06:16.180> big<00:06:16.930> and<00:06:17.590> you<00:06:17.710> can<00:06:17.830> see

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:18.070 
really isn't that big and you can see

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:19.430 
really isn't that big and you can see
right<00:06:18.910> here

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 
right here

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.730 
right here
my<00:06:20.440> sue<00:06:20.680> insatiable

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:24.740 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.830 

so<00:06:25.250> really<00:06:25.340> just<00:06:25.490> takes<00:06:25.850> you<00:06:25.970> down<00:06:26.120> here<00:06:26.450> it's

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:26.840 
so really just takes you down here it's

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.170 
so really just takes you down here it's
a<00:06:26.900> nice<00:06:27.080> extent<00:06:27.500> extension<00:06:28.220> really<00:06:28.640> easy<00:06:28.910> to

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:29.180 
a nice extent extension really easy to

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.770 
a nice extent extension really easy to
navigate<00:06:29.330> so<00:06:29.960> if<00:06:30.200> your

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780 
navigate so if your

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:35.660 
navigate so if your
so<00:06:32.330> use<00:06:33.330> that<00:06:33.360> express<00:06:34.260> that<00:06:34.830> they<00:06:34.980> have<00:06:35.220> a

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:35.670 
so use that express that they have a

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:37.550 
so use that express that they have a
couple<00:06:36.030> of<00:06:36.240> times

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 
couple of times

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.950 
couple of times
we<00:06:38.560> need<00:06:38.800> to<00:06:38.920> get<00:06:39.130> to<00:06:39.340> assume<00:06:39.640> on<00:06:39.790> say<00:06:40.030> she<00:06:40.090> is

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:40.960 
we need to get to assume on say she is

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.100 
we need to get to assume on say she is
lazy<00:06:41.590> sometimes<00:06:41.949> like<00:06:42.340> me<00:06:42.550> just<00:06:43.000> want<00:06:43.210> to<00:06:43.270> sit

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.110 
lazy sometimes like me just want to sit

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:46.290 
lazy sometimes like me just want to sit
on<00:06:44.139> the<00:06:44.350> moon<00:06:44.590> down

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:46.300 
on the moon down

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.110 
on the moon down

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:50.120 
that's certainly appropriate so yeah

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.540
