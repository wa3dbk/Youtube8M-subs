for another chemistry play here now
we've<00:01:45.180> got<00:01:45.390> i<00:01:45.570> think<00:01:46.080> his<00:01:46.170> name<00:01:46.230> is<00:01:46.500> salcedo<00:01:47.280> he

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
we've got i think his name is salcedo he

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.820 
we've got i think his name is salcedo he
was<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.240> defensive<00:01:48.780> side<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:49.110> my<00:01:49.230> two<00:01:49.290> central

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
was the defensive side of my two central

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.560 
was the defensive side of my two central
midfielders<00:01:50.340> he<00:01:50.910> did<00:01:51.060> put<00:01:51.240> in<00:01:51.330> a<00:01:51.390> pretty

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
midfielders he did put in a pretty

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.540 
midfielders he did put in a pretty
decent<00:01:51.960> shift<00:01:52.230> he's<00:01:52.590> got<00:01:52.740> five<00:01:52.950> star<00:01:53.190> week<00:01:53.340> for

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
decent shift he's got five star week for

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.070 
decent shift he's got five star week for
so<00:01:53.730> he's<00:01:54.030> pretty<00:01:54.210> good<00:01:54.420> for<00:01:54.540> passing<00:01:54.870> the<00:01:54.930> ball

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.399 
squad was lacking in some areas i think
i<00:03:38.120> should<00:03:38.299> have<00:03:38.389> had<00:03:38.479> a<00:03:38.510> more<00:03:38.780> defensive

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:39.409 
i should have had a more defensive

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:41.860 
i should have had a more defensive
center<00:03:40.099> mid<00:03:40.310> then<00:03:40.609> salcedo<00:03:41.329> cuz<00:03:41.569> he's<00:03:41.690> work

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870
