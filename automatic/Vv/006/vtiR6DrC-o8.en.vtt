00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.630
 no no no 

00:00:07.219 --> 00:00:11.940
 and not from youtube as they are today I bring you 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.530
 a new video tutorial that we are going to 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.719
 be seeing good the different 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.360
 varieties of network watches stones like 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.790
 come here we have materials of everything but 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.160
 well the first one is the most basic good 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.290
 I'm going to need the blocks first and 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.720
 most basic the one that most use 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:33.710
 we're going to have to do this place two 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.710
 of the rest with an ak other side equal 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:42.330
 not only happens repsol and connecting like this and 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.130
 As you can see, it is not fast but the truth is 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.320
 that this process is very very fast and that 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.970
 they go out like I do right now and 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.700
 have this rest in the chaos they return to 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.700
 put as it would already be working now 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.489
 we try with this gesture as you see it is 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:59.160
 very very fast until seville look 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.650
 our cebiche I think that this is the most 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.930
 fast that there is good for me that is the 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.930
 faster it's not so fast that it does not look 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.479
 not even movement and good now the 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.790
 second thing we're going to be seeing is the 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.570
 of wheel it is enough to put a 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.630
 repeater like that because of all this as well 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.490
 in a wheel not good to have the micro and 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.200
 good to put them and shin shin timing but 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.450
 well not just good and good and ready 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.890
 then as they see only good we put and 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.390
 we remove a car that has replaced very 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.940
 fast and with more days takes days and 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.590
 accelerating the process but good everything 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.700
 to show them that it works very 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.479
 ok let's put 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.890
 a piston and as you can see it was very fast and what 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.020
 we are going to work we put it all 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.740
 the gone 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:50.380
 as well as the call and all good 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.119
 now we go with the other that what 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.310
 I learned from the channel of a friend called 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:59.859
 devil but this is very good the truth 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:05.950
 for this side another in another and now only 

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:10.629
 because I leave you with the description and 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:18.120
 well what we have to do is remove 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:18.120
 the rest me but it is very very fast 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.870
 and what we are 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.840
 we are like they did not make it very slow but 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.780
 when the community members take to see 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.970
 I know I have not fought 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.350
 1 points which is very very fast to me not 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.010
 I know because you always have to stay 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:39.540
 punctured swollen was enjoyed 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.540
 forgive for that interruption 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.030
 Well the point is that they do the 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.670
 repeater indeed we apply it 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.980
 tutorials in the tutorial section 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.470
 that says good this last one that we're going 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.810
 to have to put a rail like this to another 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.660
 detector 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:04.569
 and in this part in any other we go 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:09.880
 to put this as propelled propelled 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:11.950
 then for the rest but otherwise 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.870
 to pronounce 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.470
 and well now we just put the 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:19.540
 cart here or push and as he leaves 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.849
 so far and the piston this is the 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.519
 crowd slower want it faster 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:28.510
 I just put in another propelled post 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:32.189
 here the combat is taught 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.189
 and there it will go much faster 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.640
 although it is the truth is that most of 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.010
 their churches but the point is that it leads 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.080
 like something quickie 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.510
 this is what we are going to do to make 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.730
 a gender of driver that will be of 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.319
 we with him and good the only thing that 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.500
 mean then to watch this video 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:52.360
 they comment subscribe in like and 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.189
 everything and also one more thing 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.959
 so if you can see that the definition 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:58.989
 is higher there all because also 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:01.480
 capture now so where are you going to 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:04.079
 have more definition than before and good 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.079
 see you later 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.590
 want
