case if I have to kill you
as<00:00:21.180> discussed<00:00:21.859> so<00:00:22.859> let's<00:00:23.039> call<00:00:23.189> that<00:00:23.250> three

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
as discussed so let's call that three

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.099 
as discussed so let's call that three
minutes<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.240> then<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.359> minute<00:00:24.689> break

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
minutes and then a minute break

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.210 
minutes and then a minute break
rubble<00:00:25.380> should<00:00:25.500> leave<00:00:25.650> allegedly<00:00:26.010> two

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
whatever it's starting all the fires so

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.500 
whatever it's starting all the fires so
maybe<00:00:29.400> that's<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.789> itinerary

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
maybe that's the itinerary

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.749
