00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.640
You're not dead!

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.540
Matt, where are you guys?
You should have been back by now.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.390
Jeremy.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.670
I think
you've done enough.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.960
How did you even
get in here?

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.310
I don't know.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.080
I just wanted to say good-bye
and it kind of happened.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.090
Ric?

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.060
I just want you to know...

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.710
That I will always be here
to look after you, Jeremy.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.820
And you'll never be alone.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:12.870
OK?

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.980
I promise.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.130
I don't understand.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:24.450
Oh, my God,
you're a ghost.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.660
But if you're dead...

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.330
It means Elena...

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.370
Wait! You need to know,
when Jeremy brought Elena

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.060
in here earlier tonight, her
injuries were worse than I let on.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.160
It wasn't a concussion.
It was a cerebral hemorrhage.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.819
Bleeding on the brain.

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:00.870
What are you saying?

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.170
I was so worried,
I didn't want to tell anybody.

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.250
I helped her.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.890
She needed my help.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:15.890
You what?!
