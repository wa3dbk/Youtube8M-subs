 us in the music store in ferrari-red and 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.320
 what they can do and how sound looks

 now here with us at music tv 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.399
 No 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.520
 the guitar is not just an optical one 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.740
 highlight by their special 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.900
 paint ferrari red we have too 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.420
 still strong inlays over the complete 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.300
 fingerboard distributed we have some web 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.470
 blanket and a godfather corpus that is 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.620
 the playability is really great 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:05.910
 very pleasant and completely black 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.910
 hardware very stylish 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.510
 The guitar has two jackson 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.130
 in-house j e10 high output ceramics 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.020
 hamm bakker that means they have enough 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.240
 pressure for metal rock but of course, too 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.970
 for calmer things we have one 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.670
 black tremolo bridge with tremolo ebel 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.310
 we have a volume regulator a tone 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.660
 riegler a triple world switch and 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.630
 in the triple which is it like that 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.460
 often on the lower position of the bridge 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.040
 a backhoe on the middle position 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:17.290
 Both have Becker together and also the 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.290
 upper positions of the hamburg on the neck 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.730
 O 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.730
 No 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.610
 the rest of the guitar now more accurate 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.150
 I look at the neck we see 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.400
 have 24 reasons on a 25 5 inches 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.680
 mensur that means the city standard if 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.689
 We have a few sander 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.379
 Fingerboard still lives here 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:07.349
 deposits from berlin inlays around us die 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:09.930
 back we look at the one 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.430
 maple neck with graffiti enforcement 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.450
 means stiff neck even further 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.519
 We have a white binding around neck 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.989
 and head plate and above we see then 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.250
 the black mechanics are 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.720
 enclosed and closed 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.720
 also households jackson 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.410
 b 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.099
 G 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.450
 who through the optics and also the sound 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:04.830
 then convinced of the matter 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.970
 you the price even more pleased than the 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.709
 is very attractive 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.120
 I wonder again the jackson 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.110
 actually for the price of one 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.209
 instrument can build 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.140
 that has everything you need that is 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.550
 easy to play 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.680
 it has a great sound many 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.419
 adjustment options and is included 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.160
 still pretty easy to wait and if 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.019
 you look at it it is like that 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.040
 that you do not make it harder 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.479
 as it must be then it is very 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.240
 pleasant not good in the hand 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:29.040
