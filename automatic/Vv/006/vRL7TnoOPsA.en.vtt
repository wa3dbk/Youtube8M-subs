00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.580
 CHURCH: Let me sort out 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.160
 Have you handed our flag to this guy? 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.260
 CABOOSE: Not good? 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.720
 CHURCH: Not good? Oh, no, what's wrong! 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.780
 Next time he comes over again, you might as well help him to blow the base off! 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.540
 TUCKER: There! Where is he! 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:18.120
 CHURCH: Where? 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.460
 Oh yes! I saw him! 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.820
 He is sneaking behind the cliff 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.280
 TUCKER: The mind of this nephew must be very smart. 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.040
 DONUT: Ah, my god, I am lost. 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.320
 Where is the base? 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.780
 CHURCH: I rely on... 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.540
 Hey Tucker, look at his armor. 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.420
 Is red 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.540
 TUCKER: No! Then he is their sergeant! 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.620
 CHURCH: Well, that makes sense. 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.180
 At least I know how he sneaked into our defense. 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.980
 CABOOSE: I’m saying that he came in from the back door where you just stood there. 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.800
 TUCKER: Oh, then let's get rid of him. 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.720
 CHURCH: Received 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.380
 All right 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.980
 Say good night, Sarge. 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.280
 DONUT: The scorpion raises! 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.820
 CHURCH: Hey, I am going 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.820
 What? 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.820
 TUCKER: You really don't really use that stuff, right? 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.380
 DONUT: Hey! It's me! Don't shoot! 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.220
 I am the one who bought the flag, remember? 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.720
 TUCKER: Great, he started to mock us. 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.260
 That’s really awkward 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.660
 CHURCH: Ok, stop here! I've had enough! 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.080
 Newcomer, you stay here! 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.560
 Me and Tucker, we will go to the portal and stop him at the exit. 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.140
 CABOOSE: Ok 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.440
 CHURCH: Tucker, are you ready? Let's go! 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.320
 TUCKER: I definitely don't go through this thing. 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.520
 CHURCH: Tucker, we have no time! 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.160
 If the portal is not useful, why give us the portal? 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.660
 TUCKER: How do I know! If no one can open a tank, why give us the tank? 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.700
 CHURCH: We have tested the portal already, remember? 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.400
 TUCKER: That's throwing stones in! 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.040
 CHURCH: Right, what about that? 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.580
 The stone is coming out from the other side, isn't it? 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.120
 TUCKER: The stones are coming out, they are all hot, and there are black things attached to them. 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.360
 CHURCH: Oh, everything is because of this? 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.460
 Are you afraid of that dark thing? 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.960
 TUCKER: Yes! That's right! 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.020
 I am afraid of dark things 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.360
 CHURCH: Tucker, I almost don't want to do this. 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.320
 TUCKER: You won't 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.760
 CHURCH: You know, I think about this problem like this. 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:11.740
 A, let's go through and take the flag back. B We stay here, I can kill you. 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.600
 No matter which option, I am the winner. 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.880
 TUCKER: Please remember, I want you to understand that the stone is not a human 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:17.720
 CHURCH: I will pay attention to it. 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.760
 Go inside now 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.180
 TUCKER: By... Okay. 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.800
 One! 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.380
 two! 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:40.060
 ... 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.700
 CABOOSE: Hey... 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.360
 He didn't come out from the other side 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.980
 CHURCH: Yeah... 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.340
 I am still worth... I still decided not to transfer the door. 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.540
 Ok, newcomer, you stay here! I will bring the flag back! 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.640
 SIMMONS: I still don't understand what you are saying, I didn't hear anything. 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.420
 GRIF: (sigh) I told you that it was four shots. 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.480
 Like 砰砰砰

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.040
 SIMMONS: Wait, there are only three shots. 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.900
 GRIF: Hey... 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.360
 Wait, there is a guy with a blue team moving over there. 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.620
 SIMMONS: Where are you going? 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.960
 GRIF: Oh, damn it! 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.940
 Is Donut 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.100
 What is he holding! 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.160
 looks like... 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.700
 Simmons... 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.900
 ... fast on the pig 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:23.940
 SIMMONS: Do you mean a cougar? 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.300
 CABOOSE: Where am I? 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.760
 Oh! That looks so beautiful! 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.040
 My goodness! A giant!
