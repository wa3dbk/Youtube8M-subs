00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.830 

okay<00:00:01.140> so<00:00:01.199> this<00:00:01.829> is<00:00:02.040> another<00:00:02.580> ECG<00:00:03.300> question

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
okay so this is another ECG question

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.049 
okay so this is another ECG question
that<00:00:04.170> I<00:00:04.350> got<00:00:05.210> it<00:00:06.210> says<00:00:06.600> that<00:00:06.960> this<00:00:07.799> is<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.220> ECG

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
that I got it says that this is the ECG

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.530 
that I got it says that this is the ECG
tracing<00:00:09.620> awfully<00:00:10.620> -<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.429> they<00:00:12.059> want<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.300> know

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
tracing awfully - and they want to know

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.470 
tracing awfully - and they want to know
from<00:00:13.349> where<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:14.280> B<00:00:14.519> wave<00:00:14.849> come<00:00:15.590> now<00:00:17.480> with

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
from where the B wave come now with

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.120 
from where the B wave come now with
things<00:00:18.810> that<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.289> B<00:00:19.410> wave<00:00:19.710> could<00:00:21.740> is<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:22.800> like

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
things that the B wave could is it like

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.519 
things that the B wave could is it like
abnormal<00:00:23.789> yes<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.720> see<00:00:25.109> you<00:00:25.350> can<00:00:25.740> see<00:00:26.300> pqrst

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529 
abnormal yes I see you can see pqrst

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.030 
abnormal yes I see you can see pqrst
pqrst<00:00:28.550> over<00:00:29.550> here<00:00:30.000> there's<00:00:30.390> no<00:00:30.570> B<00:00:30.990> there's<00:00:31.859> a

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
pqrst over here there's no B there's a

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.790 
pqrst over here there's no B there's a
there's<00:00:32.850> no<00:00:32.969> Q<00:00:33.329> deflection<00:00:33.960> either<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.559> then

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
there's no Q deflection either and then

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.869 
there's no Q deflection either and then
it<00:00:34.950> goes<00:00:35.130> our<00:00:35.399> SD<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.210> goes<00:00:36.660> on<00:00:36.840> so<00:00:37.590> now<00:00:38.250> let<00:00:38.850> us

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
it goes our SD and goes on so now let us

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.720 
it goes our SD and goes on so now let us
see<00:00:39.360> what<00:00:39.629> options<00:00:40.110> we<00:00:40.260> have<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.920> why<00:00:41.430> they're

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
see what options we have and why they're

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.549 
see what options we have and why they're
incorrect<00:00:42.329> put<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.530> speed<00:00:43.920> be<00:00:45.559> originated

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
incorrect put the speed be originated

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.760 
incorrect put the speed be originated
from<00:00:46.739> this<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.129> know<00:00:47.190> each<00:00:47.489> reload<00:00:48.379> no<00:00:49.379> because

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
from this I know each reload no because

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.860 
from this I know each reload no because
it<00:00:49.950> would<00:00:50.039> cause<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.719> depolarization<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.809> the

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
it would cause a depolarization of the

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.590 
it would cause a depolarization of the
atria<00:00:51.989> force<00:00:52.800> right<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.879> it's<00:00:54.000> not<00:00:54.149> design<00:00:54.480> of

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
atria force right so it's not design of

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.549 
atria force right so it's not design of
each<00:00:54.750> reload

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
each reload

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.740 
each reload
nor<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.309> from<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.699> atrium<00:00:57.300> because<00:00:57.449> we

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
nor is it from the atrium because we

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.900 
nor is it from the atrium because we
don't<00:00:58.109> have<00:00:58.410> anything<00:00:58.829> there<00:00:59.340> for<00:00:59.670> the

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
don't have anything there for the

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.720 
don't have anything there for the
ventricular<00:01:00.239> contractions<00:01:01.430> you<00:01:02.430> know<00:01:02.550> does

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
ventricular contractions you know does

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.479 
ventricular contractions you know does
another<00:01:03.059> thing<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.570> ran<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.680> says<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:05.189> the

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
another thing I ran and it says that the

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.580 
another thing I ran and it says that the
small<00:01:06.210> QD<00:01:07.220> depolarization<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.430> because<00:01:09.090> of

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
small QD depolarization is because of

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.620 
small QD depolarization is because of
septal<00:01:10.640> depolarization<00:01:11.640> from<00:01:12.030> left<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.390> right

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
septal depolarization from left to right

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.020 
septal depolarization from left to right
and<00:01:13.670> if<00:01:14.670> you're<00:01:14.939> septums<00:01:15.450> are<00:01:15.659> not<00:01:15.810> being

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
and if you're septums are not being

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.420 
and if you're septums are not being
depolarized<00:01:18.030> then<00:01:18.780> it's<00:01:19.229> probably<00:01:20.009> the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
depolarized then it's probably the

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.510 
depolarized then it's probably the
ventricles<00:01:21.330> which<00:01:21.479> initiated<00:01:22.380> this<00:01:22.830> abnormal

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
ventricles which initiated this abnormal

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.200 
ventricles which initiated this abnormal
beat<00:01:23.869> now<00:01:24.869> we<00:01:25.500> have<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.920> figure<00:01:26.250> out<00:01:26.280> which

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
beat now we have to figure out which

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.359 
beat now we have to figure out which
ones<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.600> can<00:01:27.780> turn<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.140> was<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.189> right

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
ones you can turn it was it the right

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.660 
ones you can turn it was it the right
ventricle<00:01:30.030> or<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.630> left<00:01:30.869> ventricle<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.770> this

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
ventricle or the left ventricle and this

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.960 
ventricle or the left ventricle and this
kind<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.030> goes<00:01:33.240> back<00:01:33.659> into<00:01:34.310> Ethan's<00:01:35.310> freindly

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
kind of goes back into Ethan's freindly

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.170 
kind of goes back into Ethan's freindly
which<00:01:36.869> says<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.110> if<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.680> electrical<00:01:38.430> beat<00:01:38.850> is

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
which says that if a electrical beat is

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.530 
which says that if a electrical beat is
going<00:01:39.840> towards<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.680> positive<00:01:41.340> note<00:01:41.610> then<00:01:42.390> you

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
going towards a positive note then you

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.530 
going towards a positive note then you
have<00:01:42.689> an<00:01:42.930> upward<00:01:43.170> deflection<00:01:43.970> now<00:01:44.970> we<00:01:45.030> have<00:01:45.329> an

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
have an upward deflection now we have an

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.889 
have an upward deflection now we have an
upward<00:01:45.810> deflection<00:01:46.350> here<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.240> must<00:01:48.689> be

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
upward deflection here so it must be

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.060 
upward deflection here so it must be
traveling<00:01:49.860> from<00:01:51.049> and<00:01:52.049> you<00:01:52.170> have<00:01:52.200> we<00:01:52.710> know<00:01:52.860> that

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
traveling from and you have we know that

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.880 
traveling from and you have we know that
is<00:01:53.220> lead<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.820> that<00:01:54.119> we're<00:01:54.390> talking<00:01:54.899> about<00:01:55.409> so

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
is lead to that we're talking about so

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.590 
is lead to that we're talking about so
it<00:01:56.340> must<00:01:57.090> be<00:01:57.570> from<00:01:58.200> lead<00:01:58.740> two<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.130> positive

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
it must be from lead two to positive

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.389 
it must be from lead two to positive
putting<00:02:00.600> an<00:02:00.689> upward<00:02:01.170> deflection<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:02.040> going

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
putting an upward deflection is going

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.230 
putting an upward deflection is going
from<00:02:02.700> right<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.659> left<00:02:04.079> so<00:02:04.590> it's<00:02:05.310> probably<00:02:05.880> the

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
from right to left so it's probably the

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.690 
from right to left so it's probably the
right<00:02:06.450> ventricle<00:02:07.079> who<00:02:07.290> caused<00:02:07.560> this<00:02:07.890> because

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
right ventricle who caused this because

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.800 
right ventricle who caused this because
if<00:02:08.849> it<00:02:08.970> was<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.300> left<00:02:09.660> ventricle

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
if it was the left ventricle

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.250 
if it was the left ventricle
left<00:02:11.080> ventricle<00:02:11.620> who<00:02:11.800> initiated<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.700> north

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
left ventricle who initiated the north

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.440 
left ventricle who initiated the north
sorry<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.530> beat<00:02:14.709> that<00:02:15.610> will<00:02:15.790> have<00:02:15.970> caused<00:02:16.270> a

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
sorry the beat that will have caused a

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.610 
sorry the beat that will have caused a
negative<00:02:16.989> deflection<00:02:17.200> and<00:02:18.209> that's<00:02:19.209> cool<00:02:19.620> let

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
negative deflection and that's cool let

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.040 
negative deflection and that's cool let
me<00:02:20.650> know<00:02:20.830> is<00:02:21.040> that<00:02:21.250> any<00:02:21.520> corrections<00:02:22.360> because

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
me know is that any corrections because

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.580 
me know is that any corrections because
I'm<00:02:23.319> a<00:02:23.950> medical<00:02:24.580> student<00:02:24.910> and<00:02:25.330> I<00:02:26.290> don't

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
I'm a medical student and I don't

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.770 
I'm a medical student and I don't
understand<00:02:27.069> a<00:02:27.220> lot<00:02:27.459> of<00:02:27.489> things<00:02:27.790> myself<00:02:28.030> and<00:02:28.510> I

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
understand a lot of things myself and I

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.070 
understand a lot of things myself and I
could<00:02:29.260> have<00:02:29.349> missed<00:02:29.650> out<00:02:29.830> a<00:02:29.860> whole<00:02:30.160> of<00:02:30.370> points
