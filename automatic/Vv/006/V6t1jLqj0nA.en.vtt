00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
was you know that it just you know when

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.120 
was you know that it just you know when
you're<00:05:06.020> playing<00:05:06.290> on<00:05:06.470> the<00:05:06.560> road<00:05:06.710> you're

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
you're playing on the road you're

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.370 
you're playing on the road you're
playing<00:05:07.400> a<00:05:07.550> good<00:05:07.880> defense<00:05:08.300> anyway<00:05:08.540> and<00:05:08.990> then

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
playing a good defense anyway and then

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.350 
playing a good defense anyway and then
you<00:05:09.860> hurt<00:05:10.070> yourself<00:05:10.220> an<00:05:10.730> easy<00:05:10.880> start<00:05:11.030> pressing

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
you hurt yourself an easy start pressing

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.080 
you hurt yourself an easy start pressing
I<00:05:11.690> think<00:05:12.080> that<00:05:12.230> was<00:05:12.410> some<00:05:12.620> of<00:05:12.800> it

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
I think that was some of it

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:15.580 
I think that was some of it
at<00:05:14.240> the<00:05:14.360> bottom<00:05:14.780> line<00:05:15.020> you<00:05:15.290> know<00:05:15.410> in<00:05:15.500> the

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
at the bottom line you know in the

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.710 
at the bottom line you know in the
second<00:05:16.010> half<00:05:16.130> relax<00:05:16.910> a<00:05:17.060> little<00:05:17.150> bit<00:05:17.330> started

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:20.389 
playing and I said the third downs

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:22.600 
playing and I said the third downs
in<00:05:21.169> the<00:05:21.320> second<00:05:21.710> half<00:05:21.860> I<00:05:21.980> mean<00:05:22.160> I<00:05:22.190> thought<00:05:22.430> the

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
in the second half I mean I thought the

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.270
