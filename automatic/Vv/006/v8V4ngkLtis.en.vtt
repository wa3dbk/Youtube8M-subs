00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:11.110
 one should be a hair mask for 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.180
 what are the split ends I do not know if 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.150
 have noticed that after ironing a lot 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:18.849
 the hair has our dryer 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.220
 tips start to open really is 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:23.050
 because they are very dehydrated with 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.239
 this the elements very 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.009
 easy to find in the house we are going to 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:29.950
 rehydrate a little our 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.320
 super simple hair that we're going to 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.570
 need 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.310
 a little honey has to treat honey 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.180
 natural 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:40.630
 two teaspoons of honey 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.630
 we have 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.870
 two teaspoons we are dying 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.870
 Hello 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:56.230
 in listening to this planting 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.550
 to this mixture we are going to add what is 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.360
 vinegar 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:03.850
 I'm using apple cider vinegar 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:06.220
 good to guess the normal this is the 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.400
 white vinegar to half apple I like 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.950
 more because it is not so distillate nor 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.950
 as processed as the other then it is 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.930
 softer 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.400
 this and not 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.870
 like a week and it does not have so many chemicals 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.260
 if they do not have this there is no 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.260
 problem 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.770
 a teaspoon of vinegar 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.810
 and finally we are going to use what is 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.670
 almond oil in the middle 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.950
 it's also about a lot of hydration in 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.560
 our hair this we can follow 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.780
 the two actually sold at any 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.970
 what's achieved this supermarket 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.020
 a little bit we are going to put a 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.020
 teaspoon of oil 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:10.869
 a teaspoon of this movement of what 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:14.379
 what should 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:18.420
 and if I broke my foot where the 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:20.460
 camera then I do not have how to move it 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.590
 after 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.590
 since we have our mix stays with 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:29.450
 a consistency for honey if left 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.450
 liquid but a little sticky 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.900
 we can apply only at the tip 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:39.180
 of the hair then this with a lot 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:43.489
 careful let's take a little 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.489
 and we are going to apply it in the tips 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.940
 and so we're going to apply on all the leather 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:53.730
 scalp 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.730
 it's easier to get wet directly 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.460
 and we're going to let it act after 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:04.210
 cover all the hair let's leave 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:06.430
 half an hour half an hour to the 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:10.130
 ingredients penetrate well hydrated in 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:13.060
 the hair and removed with water 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.060
 if it's water 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.150
 in the morning already after 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.310
 perfectly the hair if it was 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.380
 having a little with honey and oil 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.740
 to remove it with water a little more 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.870
 hot is removed faster 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.450
 so I hope you serve them this 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.060
 remedy they will see that it hydrates quite 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.470
 the hair 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:37.209
 so that they can use it between 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.590
 yes they are going to plan hair straighteners and 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:42.379
 treat it before 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.400
 so that I do not mistreat myself so much I hope that 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:48.769
 like this guy 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.769
 and put it into practice until later
