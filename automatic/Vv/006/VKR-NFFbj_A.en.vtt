00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.670 

now<00:00:55.150> she<00:00:55.510> needs<00:00:55.720> to<00:00:55.870> be<00:00:55.930> left<00:00:56.170> alone

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
so that she can settle find the eggs and

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.850 
so that she can settle find the eggs and
hopefully<00:01:00.040> sit<00:01:00.310> on<00:01:00.490> them<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:02.140> she's<00:01:02.410> seen<00:01:02.680> the

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
hopefully sit on them so she's seen the

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.040
