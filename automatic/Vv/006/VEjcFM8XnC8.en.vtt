 dividers where leave feet for it 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.260
 need to pay extra it costs 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:39.640
 560 rubles in my opinion if I am mistaken 500 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:41.560
 with something the separator itself i have to have 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.019
 keep them in mind because i was 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.670
 Extremely surprised and buying for the first time 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.709
 such a big palette and in fact 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.840
 very good that they get out of the cows 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.090
 product to show it because i 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.069
 I was very surprised why there are no these 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.900
 hundred Vachik for chemistry what it is I 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.299
 explain to him yes it is bought separately 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.269
 because here in this big palette 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:03.670
 but you can bet as the contributions that such a 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:07.330
 small holes with the same shadows 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:09.670
 great for powder or rouge in general here 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.100
 a story so well here in Polinochka 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:15.070
 I got here not only shadows 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.620
 mac a few throw ears triple nyushi here 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:20.100
 these pink here's these two is 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.660
 the shadow of it 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.790
 unpacked spill nila old 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.609
 packs you really so convenient 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.530
 I also wanted to see these shadows at once 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:31.299
 so that I understand that I have 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.780
 I now see that for example 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:37.540
 not enough blue and green colors well 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.519
 and I think that in principle I have things 23 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.310
 more precisely 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:45.130
 the place is so I will to buy their 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.510
 mac shadow collection go shopping 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.299
 from the body shop 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:52.510
 and the first thing I sat down is such an oil for 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:55.060
 body with argan oil called butter 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.760
 for body and hair a wild body is very 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.060
 cool thing i just try it i 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.650
 I tried the store on his hand 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.079
 need to be applied on slightly moist skin 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.050
 after shower on the body and you spray 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:10.250
 others jointly such massage 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:12.690
 rub their body smell just 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.510
 incredibly amazing 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.380
 skin becomes smooth very well 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.180
 moisturizes 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.090
 I really like that it is oil with 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.820
 pump need not squeeze anything 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.880
 cream is oil seems to me this 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:30.140
 convenient it is easy to sprinkle do 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.460
 such a massage rubbed on the body and 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.240
 actually satisfied here so here 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.700
 such a thing 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.260
 Further, that's why I came to this. 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.670
 cream for pens took here such 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.160
 small because in fact 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:44.460
 The value for the body shop is not the cheapest 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.940
 to be honest I took this 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:50.700
 a small tube of cream cream called 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:54.990
 understanding honey mania is very tasty 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:57.180
 it smells too he tried it stunning 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.790
 the smell also tried it in the store 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.190
 put on the handles very much gives 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.410
 good food moisturizing but not greasy 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.420
 I can not stand fatty hand creams 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:09.540
 me, I use them 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:11.910
 small-small amount and me 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.010
 like when he is very good 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.290
 whether it is distributed on hands of such more 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.919
 less liquid not thick straight such as 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.440
 butter 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:21.990
 Well, respectively, to moisturize here 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.790
 this cream fits my 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.070
 requirements but I will use 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:28.860
 actually think that this box is not 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.540
 enough for some months like 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.790
 finish don't necessarily tell him 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:35.640
 empty jars which in the end I 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:39.210
 impressions also bring about bought 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:42.590
 face mask here masks twice 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:47.130
 this is a mask with vitamin e 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:49.230
 indelible such is applied overnight 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.960
 it is not washed off by a fat layer well actually 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:54.300
 in the morning you wash off the remnants of the usual 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:58.080
 Yes, when I wash very much like these 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:59.370
 things you never need 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.490
 Apply there some special 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:05.110
 I donâ€™t like to apply a mask 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:08.050
 be like not 30 minutes later 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:11.650
 flush out there are of course exceptions but in 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:13.900
 Yes, I love such people 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:16.240

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:23.770
 heart of us hurry or satisfied and a mask 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.740
