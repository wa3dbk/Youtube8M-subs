not<00:00:27.349> to<00:00:27.500> do<00:00:27.619> that<00:00:27.800> because<00:00:28.040> I<00:00:28.220> still<00:00:28.610> do<00:00:28.820> have

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
not to do that because I still do have

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.540

tabs<00:01:52.670> in<00:01:53.000> Lightroom<00:01:53.450> to<00:01:54.080> do<00:01:54.230> this<00:01:54.410> is<00:01:54.590> very

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
tabs in Lightroom to do this is very

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.100 
tabs in Lightroom to do this is very
simple<00:01:55.180> the<00:01:56.180> first<00:01:56.420> step<00:01:56.660> would<00:01:56.870> be<00:01:56.930> to

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
simple the first step would be to

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.510 
simple the first step would be to
prepare<00:01:57.770> a<00:01:57.800> logo<00:01:58.280> to<00:01:58.340> go<00:01:58.700> here<00:01:59.030> you<00:02:00.020> need<00:02:00.230> to
