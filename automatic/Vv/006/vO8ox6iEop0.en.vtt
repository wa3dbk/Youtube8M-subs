server<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.750> whatnot<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.350> when<00:01:10.560> i<00:01:10.590> change<00:01:10.979> to

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
server and whatnot and when i change to

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.570 
server and whatnot and when i change to
let's<00:01:11.520> say<00:01:11.930> bait<00:01:12.930> time<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:14.010> will<00:01:14.189> turn<00:01:14.400> off

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
let's say bait time it will turn off

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.300 
let's say bait time it will turn off
everything<00:01:14.790> else<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.600> will<00:01:15.750> change<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.439> the

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
everything else and will change to the

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.100 
everything else and will change to the
clock<00:01:17.729> i<00:01:17.939> think<00:01:18.180> if<00:01:18.390> i'm<00:01:18.540> not<00:01:18.659> wrong<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:19.080> it

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
clock i think if i'm not wrong is it

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.570 
clock i think if i'm not wrong is it
changing<00:01:19.409> two<00:01:19.650> o'clock<00:01:19.890> there<00:01:20.130> we<00:01:20.220> go<00:01:20.369> it

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
changing two o'clock there we go it

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.280 
changing two o'clock there we go it
loads<00:01:20.850> up<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.119> clock<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.659> changes<00:01:22.049> and

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
loads up the clock and it changes and

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.120 
loads up the clock and it changes and
when<00:01:22.799> i<00:01:22.830> change<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.250> office<00:01:24.890> and<00:01:25.890> will

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
when i change the office and will

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.609 
when i change the office and will
automatically<00:01:26.820> change<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.180> office<00:01:27.689> so<00:01:27.990> that's

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
automatically change to office so that's

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.530 
automatically change to office so that's
it<00:01:28.799> for<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.460> Sony<00:01:29.820> Xperia<00:01:30.030> Sola<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:31.759> yeah<00:01:32.759> the

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
it for the Sony Xperia Sola and yeah the

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.390 
it for the Sony Xperia Sola and yeah the
cool<00:01:34.110> thing<00:01:34.140> would<00:01:34.470> be<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.799> floating<00:01:35.189> touch

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
cool thing would be the floating touch

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.020 
cool thing would be the floating touch
and<00:01:35.700> as<00:01:36.600> what<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.320> know<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.920> only<00:01:38.159> supports<00:01:38.520> in

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
and as what I know it only supports in

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.630 
and as what I know it only supports in
the<00:01:39.290> browser<00:01:40.290> so<00:01:40.829> currently<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.340> doesn't

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
the browser so currently it doesn't

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.399 
the browser so currently it doesn't
fight<00:01:41.909> support<00:01:42.240> anywhere<00:01:42.509> else<00:01:42.689> but<00:01:43.140> if<00:01:43.320> you

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
fight support anywhere else but if you

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.749 
fight support anywhere else but if you
can<00:01:43.590> take<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.799> look<00:01:44.040> let's<00:01:44.310> say<00:01:44.490> for<00:01:44.729> example

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
can take a look let's say for example

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.569 
can take a look let's say for example
the<00:01:45.509> home<00:01:46.170> screen<00:01:46.530> has<00:01:46.680> finite<00:01:46.950> OMT<00:01:47.430> home

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
the home screen has finite OMT home

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.109 
the home screen has finite OMT home
screen<00:01:47.880> we<00:01:48.360> see<00:01:48.570> right<00:01:48.840> if<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.670> just<00:01:50.670> hold<00:01:50.939> on

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
screen we see right if I just hold on

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.880 
screen we see right if I just hold on
top<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.689> see<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.930> background<00:01:52.140> over<00:01:52.680> there

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
top you see the background over there

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.249 
top you see the background over there
it's<00:01:53.579> actually<00:01:53.759> reacting<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.630> my<00:01:54.750> touch<00:01:55.020> let

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
it's actually reacting to my touch let
