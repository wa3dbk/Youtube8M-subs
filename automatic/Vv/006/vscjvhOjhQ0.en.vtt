ties i rustled are and I attacked my
attack<00:00:18.380> rate<00:00:18.589> was<00:00:18.769> was<00:00:19.159> high<00:00:19.339> that's<00:00:19.550> what

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
attack rate was was high that's what

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.349 
attack rate was was high that's what
I've<00:00:20.089> been<00:00:20.119> working<00:00:20.359> on<00:00:21.460> it<00:00:22.460> seemed<00:00:22.849> like<00:00:23.089> he

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:23.359 
I've been working on it seemed like he

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:24.909 
I've been working on it seemed like he
had<00:00:23.390> a<00:00:23.480> pretty<00:00:23.779> good<00:00:23.929> strategy<00:00:24.470> hit-and-run

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:24.919 
had a pretty good strategy hit-and-run

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:27.099 
had a pretty good strategy hit-and-run
he<00:00:25.099> was<00:00:25.249> all<00:00:25.550> defense<00:00:26.119> for<00:00:26.390> a<00:00:26.419> minute<00:00:26.689> 40<00:00:27.050> in

he was all defense for a minute 40 in
the<00:00:27.289> last<00:00:27.470> 20<00:00:27.859> seconds<00:00:28.869> like<00:00:29.869> I<00:00:30.970> think<00:00:33.070> maybe<00:00:34.070> I

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
the last 20 seconds like I think maybe I

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.310 
the last 20 seconds like I think maybe I
needed<00:00:34.460> to<00:00:34.550> slow<00:00:34.820> down<00:00:35.000> have<00:00:35.330> more<00:00:35.930> headache

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320

00:01:15.489 --> 00:01:15.499 
best compared to vodka compared to here

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:19.719 
best compared to vodka compared to here
probably<00:01:16.840> about<00:01:17.840> eighty<00:01:18.170> percent<00:01:18.259> okay<00:01:19.130> but

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
probably about eighty percent okay but

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:21.370 
probably about eighty percent okay but
at<00:01:19.850> that<00:01:19.880> eighty<00:01:20.210> percent<00:01:20.329> you<00:01:20.899> were<00:01:21.020> prepared

definitely felt like I could still come

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.760 
definitely felt like I could still come
here<00:01:23.910> and<00:01:24.090> when<00:01:24.300> what<00:01:25.020> do<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.140> take<00:01:25.380> from<00:01:25.590> this

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770
