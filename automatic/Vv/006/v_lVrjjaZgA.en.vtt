it'll<00:02:28.970> power<00:02:29.120> the<00:02:29.330> unit<00:02:29.600> up<00:02:29.720> and<00:02:30.050> give<00:02:30.680> us<00:02:30.800> a

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
it'll power the unit up and give us a

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.920 
it'll power the unit up and give us a
blinking<00:02:31.250> blue<00:02:31.430> light<00:02:31.670> well<00:02:32.510> if<00:02:32.570> you<00:02:32.660> can<00:02:32.780> see

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
blinking blue light well if you can see

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.980 
blinking blue light well if you can see
that<00:02:33.110> on<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.350> camera<00:02:33.620> or<00:02:33.650> not<00:02:33.940> but<00:02:34.940> that<00:02:35.240> tells

that on the camera or not but that tells
us<00:02:36.200> we're<00:02:36.560> powered<00:02:36.860> up<00:02:37.010> and<00:02:37.810> we'll<00:02:38.810> go<00:02:38.960> ahead

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
us we're powered up and we'll go ahead

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.950 
us we're powered up and we'll go ahead
and<00:02:39.500> set<00:02:40.040> this<00:02:40.160> up<00:02:40.340> we're<00:02:41.090> actually<00:02:41.660> reading

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
and set this up we're actually reading

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.090 
and set this up we're actually reading
the<00:02:42.050> data<00:02:42.230> via<00:02:42.770> bluetooth<00:02:43.250> so<00:02:44.740> we'll<00:02:45.740> set<00:02:45.980> this

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
the data via bluetooth so we'll set this

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.970 
the data via bluetooth so we'll set this
up<00:02:46.340> so<00:02:46.370> that<00:02:46.730> we<00:02:46.910> can<00:02:47.120> actually<00:02:47.570> give<00:02:48.260> you<00:02:48.350> just

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
up so that we can actually give you just

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.590 
up so that we can actually give you just
a<00:02:49.070> little<00:02:49.100> streaming<00:02:49.760> data<00:02:49.910> as<00:02:50.120> an<00:02:50.270> example

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
a little streaming data as an example

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.850 
a little streaming data as an example
before<00:02:51.290> we<00:02:51.880> record<00:02:52.880> to<00:02:53.270> an<00:02:53.420> EEPROM<00:02:53.840> since<00:02:54.650> the

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
before we record to an EEPROM since the

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.240 
before we record to an EEPROM since the
Bluetooth<00:02:55.310> can't<00:02:55.610> read<00:02:56.180> through<00:02:56.390> water<00:02:57.250> will

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
Bluetooth can't read through water will

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.300 
Bluetooth can't read through water will
record<00:02:58.580> to<00:02:58.730> EEPROM<00:02:59.360> and<00:02:59.660> then<00:02:59.930> later<00:03:00.620> pull<00:03:01.190> the

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
record to EEPROM and then later pull the

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.110 
record to EEPROM and then later pull the
data<00:03:01.460> out<00:03:02.710> so<00:03:03.710> we'll<00:03:04.160> choose<00:03:04.400> our<00:03:04.610> comm<00:03:04.850> port

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
data out so we'll choose our comm port

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.080 
data out so we'll choose our comm port
on<00:03:05.360> the<00:03:05.570> GUI<00:03:05.720> and<00:03:06.489> go<00:03:07.489> ahead<00:03:07.700> and<00:03:07.850> connect<00:03:10.090> it

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
on the GUI and go ahead and connect it

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.729 
on the GUI and go ahead and connect it
says<00:03:11.270> port<00:03:11.570> opens<00:03:11.900> so<00:03:12.110> we're<00:03:12.260> good<00:03:12.470> to<00:03:12.560> go

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
says port opens so we're good to go

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.250 
says port opens so we're good to go
and<00:03:13.310> we'll<00:03:13.730> go<00:03:13.850> ahead<00:03:13.880> and<00:03:14.090> stream<00:03:14.450> data<00:03:14.690> and

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
and we'll go ahead and stream data and

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.540 
and we'll go ahead and stream data and
when<00:03:16.040> I<00:03:16.070> pass<00:03:16.610> my<00:03:16.850> hand<00:03:16.880> over<00:03:17.300> it<00:03:17.450> like<00:03:18.350> so<00:03:18.590> you

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
when I pass my hand over it like so you

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.490 
when I pass my hand over it like so you
can<00:03:19.910> actually<00:03:20.330> see<00:03:20.870> the<00:03:21.640> the<00:03:22.640> light<00:03:22.880> data

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
can actually see the the light data

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.740 
can actually see the the light data
reduce<00:03:24.500> and<00:03:24.830> then<00:03:25.130> replenish<00:03:25.880> itself<00:03:26.180> as<00:03:26.480> as

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
reduce and then replenish itself as as

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.780 
reduce and then replenish itself as as
the<00:03:27.470> ambient<00:03:27.830> light<00:03:27.950> again<00:03:28.220> is<00:03:28.370> then<00:03:28.730> detected

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
the ambient light again is then detected

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.930 
the ambient light again is then detected
so<00:03:31.790> that<00:03:32.150> gives<00:03:32.300> it<00:03:32.360> a<00:03:32.540> little<00:03:32.810> example<00:03:33.230> and

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
so that gives it a little example and

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.400 
so that gives it a little example and
we're<00:03:34.940> ready<00:03:35.150> to<00:03:35.239> drop<00:03:35.780> this<00:03:35.959> thing<00:03:36.170> into<00:03:36.290> the

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
we're ready to drop this thing into the

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.800 
we're ready to drop this thing into the
water<00:03:36.560> and<00:03:36.950> we'll<00:03:37.820> go<00:03:37.940> ahead<00:03:38.030> and<00:03:38.180> start

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
water and we'll go ahead and start

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.140 
water and we'll go ahead and start
pulling<00:03:39.620> data<00:03:39.890> out<00:03:40.040> reading<00:03:40.790> it<00:03:40.970> to<00:03:41.060> the

in<00:03:45.500> the<00:03:45.590> water

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
in the water

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.280 
in the water
we've<00:03:47.810> got<00:03:48.020> ballast<00:03:48.440> at<00:03:48.590> the<00:03:48.680> bottom<00:03:49.010> that<00:03:49.190> and

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
we've got ballast at the bottom that and
