00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
collapse feature that so wonderful in

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:08.630 
collapse feature that so wonderful in
mind<00:01:06.180> got<00:01:07.180> that<00:01:07.330> element<00:01:07.690> let's<00:01:07.810> go<00:01:07.930> inside

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
mind got that element let's go inside

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:25.899 
mind got that element let's go inside
create<00:01:09.640> a<00:01:09.670> class

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.179 

and<00:01:26.509> there's<00:01:26.689> some<00:01:26.929> code<00:01:27.229> completion<00:01:27.710> here

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
and there's some code completion here

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.550 
and there's some code completion here
just<00:01:29.149> very<00:01:29.240> limited<00:01:29.840> hopes<00:01:30.020> it'll<00:01:30.259> get<00:01:30.409> better

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
just very limited hopes it'll get better

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.609 
just very limited hopes it'll get better
and<00:01:30.890> subsequent<00:01:31.609> releases<00:01:32.350> now<00:01:33.350> get<00:01:33.530> our

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
and subsequent releases now get our

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.639 
and subsequent releases now get our
class<00:01:33.859> and<00:01:34.310> those<00:01:34.670> curly<00:01:35.119> braces<00:01:35.649> actually

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
class and those curly braces actually

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:38.590 
class and those curly braces actually
indicate<00:01:37.009> that<00:01:37.039> the<00:01:37.579> contest<00:01:38.000> the<00:01:38.119> class<00:01:38.329> are

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
indicate that the contest the class are

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.830 
indicate that the contest the class are
wrapped<00:01:38.780> up<00:01:38.990> under<00:01:39.319> this<00:01:39.469> element<00:01:40.689> so<00:01:41.689> let's

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
wrapped up under this element so let's

00:01:41.840 --> 00:02:06.440 
wrapped up under this element so let's
add<00:01:41.959> a<00:01:41.990> function

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.850 

add<00:02:07.259> some<00:02:07.469> content<00:02:08.039> for<00:02:08.190> function<00:02:08.849> this<00:02:09.179> is<00:02:09.390> an

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
add some content for function this is an

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:56.059 
add some content for function this is an
operational<00:02:10.860> curve<00:02:11.099> that<00:02:11.760> you<00:02:11.910> really<00:02:12.239> need

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.580 

so<00:02:56.700> there<00:02:56.879> we<00:02:56.969> have<00:02:56.999> it<00:02:57.180> we<00:02:57.870> just<00:02:58.200> created<00:02:58.439> a

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
so there we have it we just created a

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.170 
so there we have it we just created a
PHP<00:02:59.400> class<00:02:59.700> file<00:03:00.209> in<00:03:00.480> minds
