00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 Hi Guys, I hope you are 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.330
 because today we have a 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.140
 step by step special decoration by 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.840
 that 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.809
 to hp after the so-called silk route project 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.410
 the journalist joseph ramada and called for 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:19.650
 create a special project to have me sky 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.210
 inspiring in the photos of that path three 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.880
 of project photos 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.859
 my three photos are textures if 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.470
 You follow me on instagram, what I already 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.019
 I liked the photos, I even have some 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.270
 spots here in turns with 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.760
 spots then pink that the colleague in the 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.570
 wall to post week looking at the 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.809
 photos and inspire me and stick with tape 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.030
 colored adhesive but back to our self 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.789
 I have three images here and I found the 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.329
 very sensory photos 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.520
 first of all we seem here this 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.980
 photo here for me is the culprit 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.440
 I see the pictures with these capetinha 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.309
 with this texture of the will to play 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.120
 in her 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.890
 this other one here refers me to fado because 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.439
 This is how I see this picture. 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.159
 always that smell only you see who 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.619
 pieces of fruit a fruit peels 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.970
 seeds some dry leaves and I think 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.310
 know the magician 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.080
 here comes the third that refers to the one here 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.500
 to the palate 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:26.020
 I see here it makes me want with this sweet 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.180
 Peanut almonds I guess I know but in 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.940
 I see quoted but the fame of it will 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.860
 eating sugar decided to choose one of these 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.080
 three here to make an equal project 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.810
 You think I chose 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.130
 I chose this papal agenda to give my 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.920
 feel favorite 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.810
 I hope you like it, it 's very easy. 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.840
 very simple I think it is not 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.120
 done really nice even is very useful 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.430
 besides the chosen stamp you also 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.780
 will need a cutting board is 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.610
 small and an empty can 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.690
 You start by painting the can with the color 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.610
 which you prefer 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:05.500
 I always go gold with the 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.140
 help of silicone glue you go 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:12.400
 put pieces of paper all around 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:15.400
 of 1 hour when the silicone glue ck is 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.770
 time to stick the can on the board 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.330
 then you will use contact glue that 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.520
 it's much stronger 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.670
 pass contact glue on both 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.650
 surfaces in the can and board 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.230
 then you let it dry for about 10 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.570
 minutes so that the solvent of cip 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:36.310
 only then will you join the two parts 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:38.350
 and let it dry for a few hours is already 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.600
 Ready, just put it on your wall. 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.600
 put the utensils you want 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.100
 This is it, I hope you guys have 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.840
 I like the step by step that you 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.410
 can make this point has children in 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.450

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.250

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.830
