where I take a standard minecraft
contraption<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:13.950> try<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:14.730> bring<00:00:15.540> it<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.750> the

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
contraption and try to bring it to the

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.930 
contraption and try to bring it to the
next<00:00:16.170> level<00:00:16.520> today

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
next level today

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.130 
next level today
sand<00:00:18.480> doors<00:00:20.510> here<00:00:21.510> we<00:00:21.630> have<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.810> pretty

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
sand doors here we have a pretty

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.310 
sand doors here we have a pretty
standard<00:00:22.560> sand<00:00:22.830> door<00:00:23.510> yeah<00:00:24.510> it's<00:00:24.720> fine<00:00:25.019> it

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
standard sand door yeah it's fine it

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.959 
standard sand door yeah it's fine it
works<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:27.050> it's<00:00:28.050> compact<00:00:31.369> it's<00:00:32.369> efficient

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
works and it's compact it's efficient

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.200 
works and it's compact it's efficient
but<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:34.500> know<00:00:34.620> what<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:35.040> think<00:00:35.309> we<00:00:35.760> can<00:00:35.940> make

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
but you know what I think we can make

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.720 
but you know what I think we can make
this<00:00:36.360> more<00:00:36.660> interesting<00:00:37.280> let's<00:00:38.280> see<00:00:38.460> if<00:00:38.550> this

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
this more interesting let's see if this

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:47.900 
this more interesting let's see if this
fits<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.120> bill<00:00:41.719> ok<00:00:42.719> good<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:43.079> far<00:00:46.820> what<00:00:47.820> is

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
fits the bill ok good so far what is

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.840 
fits the bill ok good so far what is
that<00:00:48.030> beautiful<00:00:48.300> noise<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.870> hear

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:11.109 

oh<00:00:54.280> let's<00:00:55.280> see<00:00:55.400> what<00:00:55.610> this<00:00:55.700> is<00:00:55.760> doing<00:01:09.940> yep<00:01:10.940> I

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
oh let's see what this is doing yep I

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.480 
oh let's see what this is doing yep I
definitely<00:01:11.240> call<00:01:11.900> that<00:01:12.050> over-engineered<00:01:12.830> but

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
definitely call that over-engineered but

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:14.310 
definitely call that over-engineered but
you<00:01:13.670> know<00:01:13.790> what

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
you know what

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.380 
you know what
bigger<00:01:15.320> ah<00:01:16.630> yes<00:01:17.660> bigger<00:01:18.170> bigger<00:01:18.800> is<00:01:19.009> good

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
bigger ah yes bigger bigger is good

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:41.530 
bigger ah yes bigger bigger is good
let's<00:01:20.390> try<00:01:20.630> it<00:01:22.960> okay<00:01:23.960> okay

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:52.380 

I'm<00:01:41.960> liking<00:01:42.200> all<00:01:42.410> the<00:01:42.500> Pistons

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.330 

okay<00:01:53.390> that's<00:01:53.840> fun<00:01:54.140> that<00:01:54.650> is<00:01:54.740> fun<00:01:54.980> and<00:01:55.010> it's

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
okay that's fun that is fun and it's

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.420 
okay that's fun that is fun and it's
definitely<00:01:55.790> over-engineered<00:01:56.770> but<00:01:57.770> you<00:01:58.340> know

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
definitely over-engineered but you know

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.890 
definitely over-engineered but you know
what<00:01:58.580> let's<00:01:58.730> think<00:01:59.000> outside<00:01:59.240> the<00:01:59.450> box<00:01:59.660> a<00:01:59.870> bit

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
what let's think outside the box a bit

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.840 
what let's think outside the box a bit
more<00:02:00.170> and<00:02:01.060> bigger<00:02:03.070> now<00:02:04.070> this<00:02:04.340> looks<00:02:04.580> like<00:02:04.700> it

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
more and bigger now this looks like it

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:15.360 
more and bigger now this looks like it
has<00:02:04.880> promised<00:02:06.190> let's<00:02:07.190> try<00:02:07.460> this<00:02:07.520> out<00:02:07.880> oh<00:02:12.430> yeah

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
has promised let's try this out oh yeah

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.420 
has promised let's try this out oh yeah
now<00:02:16.370> that's<00:02:16.610> a<00:02:16.700> lot<00:02:16.880> of<00:02:16.910> sand<00:02:18.250> alright<00:02:19.250> let's

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
now that's a lot of sand alright let's

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:29.170 
now that's a lot of sand alright let's
try<00:02:19.640> opening<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:20.510> door<00:02:27.400> all<00:02:28.400> righty

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
try opening the door all righty

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.750 
try opening the door all righty
you<00:02:29.660> know<00:02:29.780> what<00:02:29.930> we're<00:02:30.080> almost<00:02:30.230> there<00:02:30.890> I<00:02:30.920> think

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
you know what we're almost there I think

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.200 
you know what we're almost there I think
this<00:02:31.850> is<00:02:31.970> almost<00:02:32.770> good<00:02:33.770> enough<00:02:34.000> let's<00:02:35.000> see<00:02:35.150> how

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
this is almost good enough let's see how

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:40.870 
this is almost good enough let's see how
this<00:02:35.360> works<00:02:38.320> we<00:02:39.320> are<00:02:39.350> duplicating<00:02:39.890> bug<00:02:40.610> for

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
this works we are duplicating bug for

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.300 
this works we are duplicating bug for
the<00:02:40.940> wind<00:02:43.990> but<00:02:44.990> you<00:02:45.080> know<00:02:45.170> what<00:02:45.380> we<00:02:45.920> can<00:02:46.130> go

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
the wind but you know what we can go

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.130 
the wind but you know what we can go
even<00:02:46.520> further<00:02:46.850> my<00:02:47.450> game<00:02:47.690> isn't<00:02:47.960> lagging

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
even further my game isn't lagging

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.450 
even further my game isn't lagging
nearly<00:02:48.770> enough<00:02:49.010> yet

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
nearly enough yet

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.860 
nearly enough yet
let's<00:02:50.209> try<00:02:50.570> even<00:02:50.720> more<00:02:51.110> ah<00:02:52.150> yes<00:02:53.150> this<00:02:53.510> will<00:02:53.690> fit

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
let's try even more ah yes this will fit

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:00.100 
let's try even more ah yes this will fit
the<00:02:53.989> bill<00:02:54.170> a<00:02:54.700> 40<00:02:55.700> by<00:02:55.970> 40<00:02:56.030> sand<00:02:56.810> or<00:02:57.020> I<00:02:57.940> think<00:02:59.110> you

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
the bill a 40 by 40 sand or I think you

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.160 
the bill a 40 by 40 sand or I think you
can<00:03:00.260> call<00:03:00.500> this<00:03:00.650> over<00:03:01.070> engineering<00:03:01.610> if<00:03:02.600> not<00:03:02.930> I

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
can call this over engineering if not I

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.360 
can call this over engineering if not I
don't<00:03:03.980> know<00:03:04.400> what<00:03:04.520> is<00:03:05.440> let's<00:03:06.440> give<00:03:06.709> this<00:03:06.920> guy<00:03:07.340> a

FPS goodbye sand alright let's go up
there<00:03:53.860> and<00:03:54.070> see<00:03:54.250> how<00:03:54.400> this<00:03:54.550> goes<00:03:54.720> don't<00:03:55.720> know

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
there and see how this goes don't know

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
there and see how this goes don't know
what<00:03:55.959> the<00:03:56.050> frames<00:03:56.260> are<00:03:56.380> going<00:03:56.500> to<00:03:56.560> be<00:03:56.650> like

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
what the frames are going to be like

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:04.910
