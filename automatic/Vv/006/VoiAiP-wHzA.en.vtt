00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.870
 Hello everyone, reality check 

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:08.189
 Once upon a time there was a gamer image 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.960
 closed hermit forced 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.210
 look for virtual communication in order 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.509
 to integrate into society and find in it 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.400
 its place and even more so not sure 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.230
 that everyone knows the stereotype at the hands of that for 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.600
 fans of online games virtual and 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.880
 become analog or even substitutes 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.560
 communicating in the real world and that in 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.240
 online games people are not capable 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.250
 adapt to reality is easier 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.260
 interact with others without all 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.710
 of the difficulties and contradictions of the real 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.760
 the world we are people playing games not 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.249
 hearsay know why we say it 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.469
 completely wrong but unfortunately this 

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:44.489
 the stereotype is still preserved in 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.559
 certain circles 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.480
 well fortunately we now have 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.760
 reliably and scientific evidence which 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.800
 can show these people to dispel 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.780
 this myth is once and for all this issue 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.019
 reality checks is dedicated exactly 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.019
 to this 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.400
 social manifestations of hobbies for games 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.930
 studying online games in clinical 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.420
 conditions this is the name of the study 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.100
 conducted by university researchers 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.990
 north carolina state article 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.850
 published in the journal my computer 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.100
 children . I am Nikishin researchers 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.990
 reported that my holes can complement 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.670
 and even improve public life 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.680
 gamers and not overwhelm and and 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.960
 according to lead author Dr. Nick 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.330
 taylor gamers are not social types 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.760
 living in basements which shows them 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.220
 pop culture they are extremely sociable 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.619
 hermit people are more likely exceptions 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.320
 they are the norm and so how did they support it 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.119
 what did the researchers analyzed 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.640
 behavior in thousands of players in online games 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.930
 especially those who play mom like 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.210
 world of warcraft or 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.100
 iv online they visited a huge 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.320
 number of gaming events in canada 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.180
 and britain including small network 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.289
 meetings fan conventions 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.280
 Internet cafes and pub games 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:58.660
 parallel with these serious 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.670
 observations and interviews 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.970
 researchers spent one less 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.759
 large-scale but more detailed survey 378 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:10.990
 gamers to learn how they communicate with 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:12.970
 other people their goal was to compare 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.920
 online and offline gamer behavior 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.590
 to understand how they interact 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.480
 each other much to their surprise 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.190
 gathering of all events 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.770
 games were only one aspect 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.110
 social interaction and again 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.910
 quote Dr. taylor we found 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.380
 what gamers are showing at the same time 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.050
 many types of social behavior 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.030
 they are watching the game talking 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.740
 drink and chat online 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.900
 so although some species studied 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.640
 stops where gamers were going to such 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.860
 as an internet cafe with booths for one 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.830
 human and interfered with communication they 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.170
 other species were in the minority 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.630
 such as network meetings or 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.560
 network parties gaming conventions and 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.959
 Pub meetings 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.950
 complemented or strengthened social 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.290
 interconnection and 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.450
 as emphasized in the study 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.220
 network meetings were most often held 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.190
 romantic people friends 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.349
 relationships were guild members for 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.510
 most of them are the reasons for visiting them 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:10.180
 there was a desire to participate in online 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.910
 And offline communication is clear that this 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.280
 did not depend on what and 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.250
 players won and not even dependent on 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.870
 as they behaved during the 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.000
 There is if in the game their behavior was 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.000
 extremely hostile then to real life 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.980
 she was not tolerated player can be 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.600
 incredibly cruel in the game and still 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:32.280
 normal offline communication is great 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.810
 linked to other things about which 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.600
 reported by researchers 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.710
 moreover, they claim that all that 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.960
 going to mom 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:42.930
 can not be considered an analogue of what 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.820
 happens in real life they state 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.650
 that we should not think that the players 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.440
 are either here in the real world 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:52.200
 either there in the online world we have to think 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.450
 that they combine both essentially 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.490
 do not forget that I will repeat again 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.390
 the vast majority of people playing 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.580
 in online games 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.440
 a sense of reality remains however 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.210
 one thing that Dr. Taylor didn't know 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.280
 and the rest of the team is 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.990
 what this research focuses on 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.880
 western community alone 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.010
 differences and, accordingly, other 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.690
 results could be detected if 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.790
 I would be re-conducted study 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.070
 in other gaming cultures this is exactly 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.510
 they are planning to do well in the future 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.459
 what conclusions did you draw about it 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.560
 study write in the comments under 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.520
 video as well as if you want to read 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.650

 go to the author's blog at the link in 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.419

 watch it on youtube and link too 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:34.590
 is in the description in the last issue 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.810
 reality checks I asked 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.300
 suggest me possible topics for the future 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.280
 and i got a ton of great options 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.350
 especially on twitter user levi 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.780
 smith suggested so you should do 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.520
 the issue of batman and whether it is possible 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.830
 gadgets in reality get ready 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.480
 find out this bill hudson asked what 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.660
 causes during the game in civilization 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:57.360
 situation one more move and more suggestions 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.730
 make release accounts as a string or in 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.720
 hello or in any other 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.640
 sci-fi huge thing 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.980
