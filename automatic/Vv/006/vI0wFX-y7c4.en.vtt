all right today I want to talk about

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.990 
all right today I want to talk about
hand<00:00:07.399> signals<00:00:07.669> in<00:00:08.180> dog<00:00:08.629> training<00:00:09.549> we<00:00:10.549> get<00:00:10.760> this

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:11.000 
hand signals in dog training we get this

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.849 
hand signals in dog training we get this
every<00:00:11.570> day<00:00:11.600> all<00:00:12.379> the<00:00:12.799> time<00:00:13.070> and<00:00:14.559> it<00:00:15.559> happened

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:15.859 
every day all the time and it happened

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:17.679 
every day all the time and it happened
to<00:00:15.920> get<00:00:16.070> this<00:00:16.160> morning<00:00:16.460> so<00:00:16.699> I<00:00:16.789> figured<00:00:17.660> since

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:17.689 
to get this morning so I figured since

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:20.080 
to get this morning so I figured since
we<00:00:18.050> get<00:00:18.230> it<00:00:18.380> so<00:00:18.529> often<00:00:18.950> I<00:00:19.100> never<00:00:19.820> thought<00:00:20.030> of

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
we get it so often I never thought of

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.490 
we get it so often I never thought of
doing<00:00:20.560> any<00:00:21.560> information<00:00:22.190> on<00:00:22.250> this<00:00:22.400> but<00:00:23.500> most

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
doing any information on this but most

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.650 
doing any information on this but most
of<00:00:24.710> our<00:00:24.860> clients<00:00:25.010> neither<00:00:25.580> have<00:00:26.119> had<00:00:26.300> dog

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
of our clients neither have had dog

because I need to direct them to where
the<00:01:06.060> object<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.899> may<00:01:07.140> always<00:01:07.470> move<00:01:08.009> or

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
the object is it may always move or

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.859 
the object is it may always move or
change<00:01:09.920> most<00:01:10.920> other<00:01:11.250> things<00:01:11.759> we<00:01:12.420> do<00:01:12.630> not<00:01:12.810> want

change most other things we do not want
hand<00:01:13.439> signals<00:01:13.830> now<00:01:14.399> the<00:01:15.090> public<00:01:15.630> thinks<00:01:16.049> that

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
hand signals now the public thinks that

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.469 
hand signals now the public thinks that
hand<00:01:16.409> signals<00:01:16.830> are<00:01:16.979> cool<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.520> that's<00:01:18.330> a

hand signals are cool and that's a

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.200 
hand signals are cool and that's a
well-trained<00:01:18.960> dog<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.770> us<00:01:19.979> it's<00:01:20.399> the<00:01:20.520> opposite

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
well-trained dog to us it's the opposite

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.219 
well-trained dog to us it's the opposite
we<00:01:21.720> call<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.049> amateur<00:01:22.860> trained<00:01:23.250> or<00:01:24.229> making

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
we call that amateur trained or making

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.279 
we call that amateur trained or making
us<00:01:25.640> so<00:01:26.640> if<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.330> dogs<00:01:27.539> not<00:01:27.780> looking<00:01:28.140> at<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.939> sit

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:30.289 
us so if the dogs not looking at you sit

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:35.210 
us so if the dogs not looking at you sit
come<00:01:31.580> down<00:01:32.630> right<00:01:33.630> now<00:01:33.960> they<00:01:34.530> don't<00:01:34.830> realize

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
come down right now they don't realize

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.609 
come down right now they don't realize
on<00:01:35.490> hand<00:01:35.789> signals<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.509> has<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.960> be<00:01:37.080> looking<00:01:37.440> at

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
on hand signals and has to be looking at

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.430 
on hand signals and has to be looking at
you<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.860> do<00:01:37.979> everything<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.840> usually<00:01:39.840> also

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
you to do everything and usually also

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.469 
you to do everything and usually also
the<00:01:40.860> way<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.009> dogs<00:01:41.310> do<00:01:41.580> those<00:01:41.819> things<00:01:42.179> it's

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
the way the dogs do those things it's

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.669 
the way the dogs do those things it's
not<00:01:42.780> as<00:01:43.220> fluent<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.399> pretty<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.330> watch

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:45.679 
not as fluent and pretty to watch

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:48.800 
not as fluent and pretty to watch
because<00:01:46.679> going<00:01:47.280> off<00:01:47.459> the<00:01:47.580> hand<00:01:47.819> it's<00:01:48.179> not<00:01:48.420> the

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
because going off the hand it's not the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.559 
because going off the hand it's not the
sound<00:01:49.110> itself<00:01:49.649> so<00:01:50.399> things<00:01:50.729> become<00:01:50.880> delayed<00:01:51.860> so

00:01:53.559 --> 00:01:53.569 
sound itself so things become delayed so

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:57.080 
sound itself so things become delayed so
you<00:01:54.569> always<00:01:54.780> see<00:01:55.200> I<00:01:55.530> start<00:01:56.369> everything<00:01:56.850> from

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
you always see I start everything from

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.499 
you always see I start everything from
the<00:01:57.240> end<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.780> never<00:01:58.619> do<00:01:58.860> six<00:01:59.189> days<00:01:59.490> in<00:01:59.939> practice

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
the end I never do six days in practice

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.740 
the end I never do six days in practice
