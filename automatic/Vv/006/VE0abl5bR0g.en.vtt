00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:13.900

first<00:00:18.130> heard<00:00:18.640> the<00:00:18.970> ecstatic<00:00:19.660> chants<00:00:20.050> and

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.410 
first heard the ecstatic chants and

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.870 
first heard the ecstatic chants and
inhuman<00:00:21.340> shrieks

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880

or perhaps their ancient gods were

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.520 
or perhaps their ancient gods were
merely<00:00:37.870> mocking<00:00:38.470> me<00:00:38.680> with<00:00:39.040> their<00:00:39.220> presence
