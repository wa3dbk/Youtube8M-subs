 sure everyone will do at home 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:53.160
 So let's cook, I'll start. 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.020
 beating 110 grams of butter with 80 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.550
 grams of crystal sugar that will leave 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.710
 your name is a lot cuter 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.020
 structured and with that 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.699
 The top that everyone loves then puts 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.680
 these two ingredients in the mixer and 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.400
 beat until smooth 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.400
 whitish 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.540
 my path has already gone whitish and 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.330
 now I'll add two eggs one of 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.310
 every time and every new addition I hit 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.110
 a little bit for all this to mix 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.580
 when everything mixes the time for you 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.640
 put flour you will need to use 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.990
 130 grams of sifted flour is very 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.820
 important you lose your flour 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.990
 for your name to be much lighter 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.180
 More delicious 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.480
 in the sequence I put a pinch of salt 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:44.000
 that will enhance the taste of our angel and a 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.400
 tablespoon baking powder 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.350
 now you hit only weaves do not mix 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.850
 Beat up a lot if you will not stay 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.210

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.210

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.850

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.710
 grams of blueberry now the blueberry more 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.080

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.700
 thirds of my style and leave a third 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.800

 I will use that traditional molds of 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.300
 I'm going to use a simple paper 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.220
 butter 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.440
 so I took a piece of parchment paper 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.530
 the size of a square has more or 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.239
 less 15 centimeters by 15 and then I 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.160
 I will put it within my family of 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.260
 ivory or you can put nuno ant 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.780
 of anything you want 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.640

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.320
 butter pick up a little bit of the mass I 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.300
 I always use an ice cream goleador to 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.370
 take the right amount of the dough because 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.800
 he gives the right amount and then 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.540
 put inside the bowl means the 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.209
 our butter paper plays a little bit 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.730
 of granola on top and some women and 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.480
 this will go to 200 degrees for 20 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.810
 minutes 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.220
