00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:25.820
 half a year to learn how to program it 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.800

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:35.210

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.780
 He wants to go to Google and he asks 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.329
 Now tell me how google is there and in general 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.570
 how to get there how much they pay 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.579
 requirements and so on I would not yet become 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.710

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.170

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.920
 programmer going to work got 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.780
 but so as if without irony people 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.340

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.359

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.189

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.939
 grow swift as well as you 

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:19.700
 half a year you also became a programmer 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:22.219
 you can for a couple of years the world try to become 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.609

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:29.389
 years a good programmer and so on 

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:31.789
 What about Google, I would say that there is 

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:33.619

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:35.719
 Now you have such a child programmers 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.330

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:42.190
 children's dreaminess 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:43.170

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.120
 I'm in the same office 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.220
 the tester was type manager by 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.110
 testing and there was a boy one he 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.690
 with such a cart walked there and delivered 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.710
 carried such a cocktail on which he was there 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.680
 the department was 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.110
 maybe by sending there odd and and he somehow 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.600

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.220

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.110

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.090
 it burns I'm hot 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.260

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.940
 94 year and this 20 years ago and then 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.830
 microsoft was not like it is now 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.770
 he was trampled there and then it was 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.720
 not at all what he says imagine 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.930
 year here I go with a cart down the hall and 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.720

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.850

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:38.170
 what can I say she is not bad I am generally for 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.500
 then to have a good dream and such 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.959
 warm which warms but i think 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.459
 when you become serious how would 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.920
 you will have no problems 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:51.160
 how to get to google and you will have 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.810
 question and I need it, but if I am 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.940
 take there let's say in absolutely any 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.440
 company where i want to go and this one 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.239
 almost so when you have 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.600
 will appear in an experienced green card in your pocket 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:04.750
 will we have on the channel I do not want a finger 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.800
 poke we had one man I him 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.900
 filmed some time ago here's one of 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.970
 startups clients and rekhyan like me 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.070
 So 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.790
 filmed an interview with him and so he worked in 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.980
 Facebook 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.650
 before you start your company your business 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.990
 and he was on a work visa he had 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.290
 Visa and hoses are a bit more complicated than 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:28.870
 when their gel card so here it is 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:33.220
 Facebook has earned him 500,000 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.900
 dollars a year and and before that in google and 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.370
 worked there somewhere else I just worked 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.280
 what am telling when your level 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.080
 what that is who you are not thinking about 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.030
 what will you google like manna 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.500
 heavenly and you already appear 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.080
 professional goals 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.630
 here you are as an expert as a professional 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.170
 as a person who wants something 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.910
 to tell 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.240
 don't want to go to such a place 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.640
 where is that you yourself are not very can 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:00.940
 offset by the fact that the company has a strong 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.800
 you get to a place where if you don’t 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.040
 it was such a level you would not take here 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:09.330
 But in this state have to come so 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:13.290
 in terms of setting goals 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:16.239
 such short term and maybe 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.430
 in the long run I would not strive to work in 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.160
 this or that company is no difference 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.990
 here we have google and I don’t remember them 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.000
 4000 that lego works here in 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.890
 Silicon Valley everyone who wanted to work 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.050
 in google and all worked in google it is 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.330
 large such employer also like apple 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.180
 constantly hiring me is full of guys 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.350
 straight from school worked in google and but 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.610
 if you want a permanent job there 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.500
 it's harder they are very much 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.380
 consultants are taken there for some 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.180
 half a year old 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.250
 permanent job more difficult selection 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.490
 to a more serious position even more 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.230
 difficult selection and so on but the matter even 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.630
 Is n't that what it is you need? 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.550
 from this you will have and how it is 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.880
 fits your long term goals 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:00.370
 when you have your own 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:03.820
 long-term goals then you will think 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:07.450
 google fits my goals or not 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:10.450
 if this google is also what exactly 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:12.860
 google class and I would like yes 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:15.250
 not that there is not 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:18.110
 give as uncle works in the Kremlin and 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.909
 sweep pass you don't want to sweep 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.680
 in the Kremlin, if you already work in the Kremlin 

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:23.629
 want to work for a serious position 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.020
 sweat and go to google and work 

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:28.699
 so not a janitor so here i would 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.349
 focused on putting 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:34.250
 in front of some serious 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:36.889
 professional goals and objectives and here 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:41.569
 then it will be clear in which company 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:44.389
 where exactly is there more 

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:47.060
 narrow technologically there and so on here 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:49.759
 everything else is very self in itself 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.330
 That’s why it shouldn’t fit now 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:52.969
 to worry 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:55.069
 how do you google have to 

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:57.710
 worry how to grow to that level 

00:05:55.069 --> 00:05:59.569
 when you say what google can do and 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.279
 work look, please take a look 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:02.870
 Now you have a choice of 10 positions here here 

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:07.180
 it is a worthy goal 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.180
 especially for beginners happy
