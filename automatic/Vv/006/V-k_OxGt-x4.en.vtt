looks out by the t-rex and you got the

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.610 
looks out by the t-rex and you got the
Pteranodon<00:04:28.540> in<00:04:28.690> the<00:04:28.780> sky<00:04:28.960> so<00:04:29.230> it's<00:04:29.380> really

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
Pteranodon in the sky so it's really

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.710 
Pteranodon in the sky so it's really
different<00:04:29.890> it's<00:04:30.850> not<00:04:30.940> just<00:04:31.000> asymmetric

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
different it's not just asymmetric

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.700 
different it's not just asymmetric
gameplay<00:04:31.750> it's<00:04:32.230> asymmetric<00:04:32.770> camera<00:04:33.130> work

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
gameplay it's asymmetric camera work

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.680 
gameplay it's asymmetric camera work
so<00:04:34.100> the<00:04:34.220> scaling<00:04:34.640> is<00:04:34.730> definitely<00:04:35.270> on<00:04:35.420> point

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
so the scaling is definitely on point

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.080
