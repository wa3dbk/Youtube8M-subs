hi<00:00:08.670> i'm<00:00:08.820> jay<00:00:09.059> from<00:00:09.240> real<00:00:09.420> street<00:00:09.599> performance

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
hi i'm jay from real street performance

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.209 
hi i'm jay from real street performance
and<00:00:10.290> today<00:00:10.440> we're<00:00:10.559> going<00:00:10.679> to<00:00:10.740> talk<00:00:10.889> about<00:00:11.010> the

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
and today we're going to talk about the

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.129 
and today we're going to talk about the
surface<00:00:11.610> finish<00:00:11.910> of<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.240> deck<00:00:12.690> of<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:12.900> block

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
surface finish of the deck of the block

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.620 
surface finish of the deck of the block
and<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.740> solar<00:00:13.980> head<00:00:14.190> in<00:00:14.309> regards<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:14.790> gasket

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
and the solar head in regards to gasket

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:22.070 
and the solar head in regards to gasket
sealing<00:00:20.029> so<00:00:21.029> one<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.420> problems<00:00:21.779> that<00:00:21.900> we

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
sealing so one of the problems that we

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.929 
sealing so one of the problems that we
see<00:00:22.320> is<00:00:22.500> people<00:00:22.859> have<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.310> wrong<00:00:23.460> surface

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
see is people have the wrong surface

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.060 
see is people have the wrong surface
finish<00:00:24.269> or<00:00:24.539> are<00:00:25.019> applying<00:00:25.470> some<00:00:25.830> sort<00:00:25.859> of

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
finish or are applying some sort of

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.800 
finish or are applying some sort of
secondary<00:00:26.550> sealant<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.269> multi-layer

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
secondary sealant to a multi-layer

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.009 
secondary sealant to a multi-layer
gasket<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:29.130> will<00:00:29.279> create<00:00:29.840> more<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:30.960> a

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
gasket and that will create more of a

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.510 
gasket and that will create more of a
sealing<00:00:31.380> problems<00:00:31.890> than<00:00:32.250> if<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.489> just

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
sealing problems than if you just

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.190 
sealing problems than if you just
install<00:00:33.059> it<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.300> way<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.630> manufacturer

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
install it the way that manufacturer

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.319 
install it the way that manufacturer
suggests<00:00:34.410> so<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.460> problem<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:35.940> with<00:00:36.300> a

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
suggests so the problem is with a

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.970 
suggests so the problem is with a
multi-layer<00:00:36.809> still<00:00:37.140> head<00:00:37.320> gasket<00:00:37.739> it

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
multi-layer still head gasket it

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.819 
multi-layer still head gasket it
requires<00:00:38.340> not<00:00:39.000> only<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.329> truly<00:00:39.960> flat<00:00:40.260> surface

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
requires not only a truly flat surface

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.060 
requires not only a truly flat surface
but<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.430> surface<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.390> has<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.960> right<00:00:43.140> finish

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
but a surface that has the right finish

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.770 
but a surface that has the right finish
on<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.399> so<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.879> gasket<00:00:45.090> can<00:00:45.450> do<00:00:45.570> its<00:00:45.719> job

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
on it so that the gasket can do its job

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.959 
on it so that the gasket can do its job
correctly<00:00:46.230> while<00:00:46.950> most<00:00:47.160> tension<00:00:47.340> shops<00:00:47.760> have

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
correctly while most tension shops have

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.580 
correctly while most tension shops have
a<00:00:48.000> tool<00:00:48.329> like<00:00:48.360> this<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.960> measure<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.379> surface

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
a tool like this to measure the surface

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.170 
a tool like this to measure the surface
finish<00:00:49.890> at<00:00:50.219> home<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.579> can<00:00:50.700> get<00:00:50.820> away<00:00:50.940> with

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
finish at home you can get away with

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.869 
finish at home you can get away with
just<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.539> fingernail<00:00:51.930> test<00:00:52.430> so<00:00:53.430> here<00:00:53.640> we<00:00:53.760> have

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
just the fingernail test so here we have

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.340 
just the fingernail test so here we have
a<00:00:53.910> cylinder<00:00:54.270> head<00:00:54.420> that's<00:00:54.570> been<00:00:54.750> recently

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
a cylinder head that's been recently

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.229 
a cylinder head that's been recently
decked<00:00:55.739> while<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.340> can<00:00:56.460> see<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.730> surface<00:00:57.059> is

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
decked while you can see the surface is

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.060 
decked while you can see the surface is
clean<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.870> smooth<00:00:58.199> when<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:58.680> drag<00:00:58.949> your

clean and smooth when you drag your

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.650 
clean and smooth when you drag your
fingernail<00:00:59.399> across<00:00:59.730> it<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.210> doesn't<00:01:00.420> really

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
fingernail across it it doesn't really

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
over from a dull cutter or you can catch

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.340 
over from a dull cutter or you can catch
your<00:01:08.189> fingernail<00:01:08.729> in<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.330> grooves<00:01:09.659> that's

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
your fingernail in the grooves that's

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.899 
your fingernail in the grooves that's
not<00:01:10.619> gonna<00:01:10.770> work<00:01:11.040> well<00:01:11.220> with<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.430> multi-layer

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
not gonna work well with a multi-layer

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.000 
not gonna work well with a multi-layer
steel<00:01:12.210> head<00:01:12.330> gasket<00:01:12.780> so<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.530> one<00:01:13.680> subject

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
steel head gasket so this is one subject

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.770 
steel head gasket so this is one subject
that<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.430> OE<00:01:14.580> manufacturers<00:01:15.360> have<00:01:15.540> really

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
that the OE manufacturers have really

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.630 
that the OE manufacturers have really
figured<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.259> out<00:01:16.350> for<00:01:16.619> us<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:17.220> don't<00:01:17.400> need<00:01:17.520> to

figured it out for us you don't need to

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.510 
figured it out for us you don't need to
use<00:01:17.909> any<00:01:18.720> sort<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.080> sealant<00:01:19.590> or<00:01:19.920> listen<00:01:20.400> to
