years<00:00:39.030> we<00:00:39.540> now<00:00:39.660> have<00:00:39.840> 73<00:00:40.320> countries

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
years we now have 73 countries

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.369 
years we now have 73 countries
participating<00:00:41.600> it's<00:00:42.600> very<00:00:42.780> important<00:00:43.260> to

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
participating it's very important to

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.250 
participating it's very important to
involve<00:00:43.739> children<00:00:44.129> in<00:00:44.789> two<00:00:45.149> decisions<00:00:45.960> now

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
involve children in two decisions now

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.010 
involve children in two decisions now
about<00:00:47.190> what<00:00:47.579> we're<00:00:47.760> doing<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:48.149> safeguard<00:00:48.840> the

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
about what we're doing to safeguard the

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.990 
about what we're doing to safeguard the
future<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.680> think<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.340> lot<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.520> people<00:00:50.820> would

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
future I think a lot of people would

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.420 
future I think a lot of people would
recognize<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.510> adults<00:00:51.899> today<00:00:52.500> haven't<00:00:53.280> done

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
recognize that adults today haven't done

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.380 
recognize that adults today haven't done
a<00:00:53.460> very<00:00:53.670> good<00:00:53.820> job<00:00:54.260> of<00:00:55.260> protecting<00:00:56.239> the<00:00:57.239> future

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
a very good job of protecting the future

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.270 
a very good job of protecting the future
of<00:00:57.750> protecting<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.289> environment<00:00:58.379> protecting

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
of protecting the environment protecting

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.700 
of protecting the environment protecting
future<00:00:59.609> generations<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:00.960> our<00:01:01.140> idea<00:01:01.320> is<00:01:01.680> to

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
future generations so our idea is to

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.310 
future generations so our idea is to
give<00:01:01.980> children<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.910> voice<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.840> these<00:01:04.019> matters

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
give children a voice in these matters

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.830 
give children a voice in these matters
and<00:01:04.710> they've<00:01:05.549> completely<00:01:06.119> listened<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.720> the

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
and they've completely listened to the

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.890 
and they've completely listened to the
challenge<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.549> we've<00:01:08.549> been<00:01:08.760> blown<00:01:09.540> away<00:01:09.780> by

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
challenge and we've been blown away by

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.500 
challenge and we've been blown away by
the<00:01:10.170> incredible<00:01:11.070> interest<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:12.030> excitement

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
the incredible interest and excitement

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.660 
the incredible interest and excitement
about<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.049> competition<00:01:13.590> from<00:01:13.920> all<00:01:14.430> around

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
about the competition from all around

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.000 
about the competition from all around
the<00:01:14.880> world

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.010 
the world

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.100 
the world
incredibly<00:01:16.790> excited<00:01:17.300> about<00:01:17.360> the<00:01:17.600> protection

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
incredibly excited about the protection

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.790 
incredibly excited about the protection

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.660 

I<00:01:25.620> used<00:01:26.620> to<00:01:26.680> always<00:01:26.770> think<00:01:27.040> that<00:01:27.190> environment

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
I used to always think that environment

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.270 
I used to always think that environment
was<00:01:27.880> just<00:01:28.390> one<00:01:28.750> single<00:01:29.410> aspect<00:01:29.830> of<00:01:30.100> our

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
was just one single aspect of our

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.620 
was just one single aspect of our
community<00:01:30.670> which<00:01:30.850> was<00:01:30.970> really<00:01:31.210> important<00:01:31.540> but

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
community which was really important but

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.120 
community which was really important but
now<00:01:31.870> I<00:01:31.900> realize<00:01:32.320> that<00:01:32.350> there's<00:01:32.950> so<00:01:33.070> many

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
now I realize that there's so many

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.800 
now I realize that there's so many
different<00:01:33.700> aspects<00:01:34.030> that<00:01:34.060> could<00:01:34.270> be<00:01:34.420> joined

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
different aspects that could be joined

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.080 
different aspects that could be joined
to<00:01:34.990> our<00:01:35.020> environment<00:01:35.560> and<00:01:35.740> sustainability<00:01:36.280> is

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
to our environment and sustainability is

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.850 
to our environment and sustainability is
much<00:01:37.480> more<00:01:37.780> than<00:01:38.110> just<00:01:38.140> being<00:01:38.530> eco-friendly

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
much more than just being eco-friendly

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.090 
much more than just being eco-friendly
or<00:01:39.520> just<00:01:39.850> kind<00:01:40.300> of<00:01:40.360> recycling<00:01:40.900> it's<00:01:41.140> more<00:01:41.380> the

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
or just kind of recycling it's more the

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.040 
or just kind of recycling it's more the
way<00:01:42.250> that<00:01:42.850> you<00:01:43.000> live<00:01:43.240> in<00:01:43.420> the<00:01:43.540> way<00:01:43.660> that<00:01:43.870> you
