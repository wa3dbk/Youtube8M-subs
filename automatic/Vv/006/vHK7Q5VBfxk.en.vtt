00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
the instructions I guess you can call

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.030 
the instructions I guess you can call
them<00:02:31.730> so<00:02:32.730> looks<00:02:33.120> like<00:02:33.360> my<00:02:34.080> uses<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.620> little

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
them so looks like my uses the little

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.890 
them so looks like my uses the little
hole<00:02:35.340> here<00:02:35.370> I<00:02:35.880> believe<00:02:36.180> I<00:02:36.270> have<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.450> first

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
hole here I believe I have to first

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.010 
hole here I believe I have to first
unscrew<00:02:37.350> this<00:02:37.740> to<00:02:38.610> open<00:02:39.120> it<00:02:39.210> up<00:02:39.300> so<00:02:39.480> we'll<00:02:39.600> fit

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
unscrew this to open it up so we'll fit

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:57.300 
unscrew this to open it up so we'll fit
in<00:02:40.610> let's<00:02:41.610> see<00:02:46.430> pretty<00:02:47.430> sure<00:02:47.580> unscrews

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.090 

there<00:02:58.310> we<00:02:58.400> go<00:02:58.630> all<00:02:59.630> right<00:02:59.690> so<00:03:00.560> I<00:03:00.590> got<00:03:00.740> loosened

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
there we go all right so I got loosened

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.190 
there we go all right so I got loosened
up<00:03:01.160> then<00:03:02.380> so<00:03:03.380> we<00:03:03.470> can<00:03:03.500> insert<00:03:04.130> that<00:03:04.580> in<00:03:05.200> and

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
up then so we can insert that in and

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.830 
up then so we can insert that in and
then<00:03:06.380> get<00:03:06.650> it<00:03:06.770> worked<00:03:07.190> back<00:03:07.460> into<00:03:07.790> place<00:03:10.840> let's

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
then get it worked back into place let's

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:20.400 
then get it worked back into place let's
see

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:28.510 

tres<00:03:21.410> Telus<00:03:21.800> works<00:03:22.010> exactly<00:03:27.010> so<00:03:28.010> as<00:03:28.100> you<00:03:28.220> turn

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
tres Telus works exactly so as you turn

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.310 
tres Telus works exactly so as you turn
it<00:03:28.580> and<00:03:29.120> kind<00:03:29.360> of<00:03:29.420> locks<00:03:29.630> and<00:03:29.750> unlocks<00:03:29.900> it<00:03:30.230> in

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
it and kind of locks and unlocks it in

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.880 
it and kind of locks and unlocks it in
different<00:03:30.560> parts<00:03:30.950> but<00:03:32.380> like<00:03:33.380> right<00:03:33.560> now<00:03:33.680> it's

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
different parts but like right now it's

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.550 
different parts but like right now it's
loose<00:03:34.610> in<00:03:34.940> there<00:03:35.270> I<00:03:37.900> think<00:03:38.900> you<00:03:38.960> have<00:03:39.080> to<00:03:39.140> get

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
loose in there I think you have to get

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.660 
loose in there I think you have to get
and<00:03:39.770> then<00:03:39.920> lock<00:03:40.460> into<00:03:40.760> place<00:03:40.910> somehow

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
and then lock into place somehow

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.570 
and then lock into place somehow
