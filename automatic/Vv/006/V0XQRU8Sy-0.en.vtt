in<00:00:00.060> this<00:00:00.930> metal<00:00:01.260> forming<00:00:01.589> video<00:00:01.890> I'm<00:00:02.190> going<00:00:02.399> to

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
in this metal forming video I'm going to

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.640 
in this metal forming video I'm going to
show<00:00:02.760> you<00:00:02.820> how<00:00:03.030> to<00:00:03.090> correctly<00:00:03.510> use<00:00:03.600> ascribe<00:00:04.380> to

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
show you how to correctly use ascribe to

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.470 
show you how to correctly use ascribe to
make<00:00:05.130> a<00:00:05.160> mark<00:00:05.460> on<00:00:05.549> your<00:00:05.730> sheet<00:00:05.970> so<00:00:06.210> that<00:00:06.359> you

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
make a mark on your sheet so that you

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.150 
make a mark on your sheet so that you
can<00:00:06.660> drill<00:00:06.930> through<00:00:06.960> your<00:00:07.379> sheet<00:00:07.620> to<00:00:08.130> make

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
can drill through your sheet to make

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.250 
can drill through your sheet to make
rivets<00:00:08.639> or<00:00:08.880> other<00:00:09.150> types<00:00:09.450> of<00:00:09.570> connections<00:00:10.050> to

dapping block and then take your
millimeter<00:00:36.059> gauge<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.809> great<00:00:36.989> thing

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
millimeter gauge and the great thing

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.479 
millimeter gauge and the great thing
about<00:00:37.260> this<00:00:37.620> millimeter<00:00:38.070> gauge<00:00:38.280> in

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
about this millimeter gauge in

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.670 
about this millimeter gauge in
particular<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:39.960> can<00:00:40.110> remove<00:00:40.410> the

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
particular is that you can remove the

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.830 
particular is that you can remove the
center<00:00:40.980> like<00:00:41.399> so<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.910> now<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.210> have<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.510> very

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
center like so and now you have a very

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.100 
center like so and now you have a very
useful<00:00:43.079> ruler<00:00:44.329> place<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.480> horizontally<00:00:46.079> on

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
useful ruler place it horizontally on

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.139 
useful ruler place it horizontally on
your<00:00:46.410> work<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.770> for<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:47.370> first<00:00:47.610> measurement

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
your work and for this first measurement

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.510 
your work and for this first measurement
you<00:00:48.420> can<00:00:48.450> approximate<00:00:49.320> in<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.829> middle<00:00:50.100> where

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
you can approximate in the middle where

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.639 
you can approximate in the middle where
to<00:00:50.610> line<00:00:50.789> up<00:00:50.940> your<00:00:51.059> ruler<00:00:51.120> you'll<00:00:52.079> really<00:00:52.350> dial

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
to line up your ruler you'll really dial

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.410 
to line up your ruler you'll really dial
it<00:00:52.800> in<00:00:52.890> after<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.340> turn<00:00:53.489> your<00:00:53.670> ruler<00:00:53.910> on<00:00:54.090> the

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
it in after you turn your ruler on the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.330 
it in after you turn your ruler on the
vertical<00:00:54.690> but<00:00:55.379> for<00:00:55.530> this<00:00:55.620> first<00:00:55.800> measurement

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
vertical but for this first measurement

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.520 
vertical but for this first measurement
anywhere<00:00:56.940> here<00:00:57.180> somewhere<00:00:57.840> in<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.050> middle<00:00:58.379> is

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
anywhere here somewhere in the middle is

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.439 
anywhere here somewhere in the middle is
just<00:00:58.620> fine<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.219> then<00:00:59.550> hold<00:00:59.789> everything<00:01:00.300> down

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
just fine and then hold everything down

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.139 
just fine and then hold everything down
with<00:01:00.629> your<00:01:00.780> non-dominant<00:01:00.960> hand<00:01:01.379> like<00:01:01.829> so<00:01:02.149> take

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
with your non-dominant hand like so take

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.329 
with your non-dominant hand like so take
your<00:01:03.300> scribe<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:04.860> course<00:01:05.040> if<00:01:05.220> you're

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
your scribe and of course if you're

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.100 
your scribe and of course if you're
left-handed<00:01:05.610> just<00:01:06.180> reverse<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.630> hands<00:01:06.960> and

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
left-handed just reverse the hands and

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.030 
left-handed just reverse the hands and
then<00:01:08.070> measure<00:01:08.549> out<00:01:09.500> exactly<00:01:10.500> where<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.830> want

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
then measure out exactly where you want

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.679 
then measure out exactly where you want
your<00:01:11.130> mark<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.460> be<00:01:11.580> for<00:01:11.939> me<00:01:12.060> I'm<00:01:12.330> trying<00:01:12.540> to

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
your mark to be for me I'm trying to

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.990 
your mark to be for me I'm trying to
find<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.350> exact<00:01:13.710> middle<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.280> sheet<00:01:14.790> so

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
find the exact middle of the sheet so

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.340 
find the exact middle of the sheet so
that<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.150> control<00:01:15.479> right<00:01:15.720> through<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.080> center

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
that I control right through the center

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.890 
that I control right through the center
now<00:01:17.280> as<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.670> can<00:01:17.820> see<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.150> don't<00:01:18.270> have<00:01:18.689> this

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
now as you can see I don't have this

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.749 
now as you can see I don't have this
scribe<00:01:19.229> in<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.799> death<00:01:20.009> grip<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.490> I'm<00:01:20.580> not

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
scribe in a death grip and I'm not

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.969 
scribe in a death grip and I'm not
really<00:01:21.210> itching<00:01:21.810> on<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.020> metal<00:01:22.290> I'm<00:01:22.470> simply

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
really itching on the metal I'm simply

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.060 
really itching on the metal I'm simply
making<00:01:23.009> just<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.729> quick<00:01:24.229> light<00:01:25.229> mark<00:01:25.530> because

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
making just a quick light mark because

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.730 
making just a quick light mark because
the<00:01:26.280> tip<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.640> this<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:27.090> very<00:01:27.479> sharp<00:01:27.810> this<00:01:28.590> will

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
the tip of this is very sharp this will

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.780 
the tip of this is very sharp this will
do<00:01:28.860> all<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.100> work<00:01:29.130> for<00:01:29.280> you

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
do all the work for you

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.880 
do all the work for you
make<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.240> little<00:01:30.570> scratch<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.380> then<00:01:31.650> let<00:01:31.799> me

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
make a little scratch and then let me

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.950 
make a little scratch and then let me
pick<00:01:32.040> this<00:01:32.189> up<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.670> can<00:01:32.790> see<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.750> is

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
pick this up so that you can see this is

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.230 
pick this up so that you can see this is
the<00:01:34.229> scratch<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.860> was<00:01:34.979> left<00:01:35.189> nothing<00:01:36.119> too

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
the scratch that was left nothing too

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.289 
the scratch that was left nothing too
big<00:01:36.420> we<00:01:36.869> don't<00:01:36.900> want<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.759> so<00:01:38.759> now<00:01:38.880> lay<00:01:39.119> your

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
big we don't want that so now lay your
