00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.599
 good afternoon dear channel viewers 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.389
 plants we are visiting with the ogres lau and 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.130
 now we are in the greenhouse in which 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.210
 full as you see all sorts of different 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.340
 junipers and we'll talk about 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.250
 Blue chip junipers are very 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.590
 cute very, very, very 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.759
 juniper which i really love me 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.960
 he likes the fact that when it grows 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.570
 already an adult plant 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.990
 she looks almost like a clear star 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:44.250
 rare rare branches need to prune 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:46.560
 fills the middle very well bares 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.130
 branches much later than many others 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:52.020
 central century bare therefore 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:54.690
 probably for this i love him and how are you 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.960
 you can see it is not just lying on the ground and 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.810
 the branches are slightly raised it grows 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.670
 as low as possible in the central 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:06.090
 point at the center point of the trunk 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:10.530
 adult condition probably centimeter 25 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.860
 but it should try but you look 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.260
 what a beautiful color it is blue 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:19.200
 juniper is another nuance 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.720
 in winter this blueness acquires such 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.380
 a lilac pinkish hue is also very 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.060
 looks nice and again you 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.900
 juniper of two colors 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.690
 in summer 1 in winter another juniper this 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.330
 not capricious it grows beautifully on 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.970
 the sun then it is brighter more 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.560
 blue is not in the shadows either 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.909
 feel bad the only thing 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.159
 on the branches a little more suspender and 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.780
 the plant will not be such a bright color but 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.930
 some part of the blueness she's still 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.330
 save and naturally need to remember about 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.880
 the fact that such junipers 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.290
 you can direct as you want 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.290
 you can cut off 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:06.320
 one part and lower the second 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.960
 let's say it will be already as more 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.420
 curb or cascade version but it 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.940
 also looks interesting you can let 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.330
 him grow to chance as he grows and 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.280
 then you will get on your plot 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.070
 very beautiful bright blue star 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.670
 so do not be afraid of this juniper 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:27.440
 it grows well in our zone and 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.570
 feel great need 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.100
 try to kill him all 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.100
 Good, see our channel
