00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:10.330
 Hi everyone, alright, thanks for being 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.490
 watching this video and in this video here 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:17.080
 that I will show a simple technique 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:20.050
 to photograph that changes this 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.300
 Our location of the photograph is not 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.940
 we can see that the scenario here a 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:28.630
 common theme a florida tree 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:31.630
 down there and this train track has already 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:35.230
 abandoned with these marks in front of you 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:37.690
 and if we pick up the camera so change 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.860
 just a little bit I'll take this camera 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:44.829
 here and I will hold the focus here on the tree 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.710
 leave the focus there in the manual and leave 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:51.040
 recorded there in the tree more or less and I'll 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:54.460
 simply lower the camera that this 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.620
 positioning the camera to let 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.750
 these elements of composition nor 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.550
 What are these grasses that are in front 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:05.259
 This little girl was already a little bit 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.160
 florida and how the focus is set there in the 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:08.200
 tree 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.330
 All these plants in front here I go 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.420
 stay out of focus right? 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.880
 and I'm using s 50 that taking with 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:19.810
 her and taking some photos in 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.640
 we see that just putting those 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.490
 other elements in front of the 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.069
 photography, we transform this 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.740
 this location of the photo on the 

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:32.080
 It does not look like the picture was 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.200
 done in some other place or some 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:38.619
 another much more beautiful place of 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.890
 which is really here and this is just for 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:44.560
 show that this change in the position of the 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:48.160
 camera is already making a very big change 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:52.360
 in our composition of the image as 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.580
 in this perhaps allegory in this reality of the 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.319
 image as soon as we can 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.229
 transform yourself using this 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:02.289
 positioning of the bed nor here I am 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:05.410
 I lowered the camera to the ground and left 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:07.110
 right behind this kills here to be able 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.270
 then blurs 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.340
 if you take that full blur so he 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.400
 It looks like there's a ring in the front here. 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.130
 nor does it seem like there's a fog in the city 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.620
 There's nothing like that, and it changes. 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.720
 enough in this one photo like this 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.240
 It was black and white and it ends up giving 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.760
 feeling of a technical thing, too. 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:30.090
 and it depends on how we want it 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.130
 demonstrate our photography right now and 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.380
 camera positioning than the protocol 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.330
 showing cnec is now downloading 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.840
 quite the chamber so close to the show 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:43.380
 already turns that photograph into another 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:46.890
 photography and turns this place into 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.890
 very different place that probably 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.630
 a person who understands a lot of photography 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.730
 you will never be able to relate this 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.410
 place with those with these photos 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.420
 What did I do here? 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:01.830
 especially this is where it appears 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.870
 the trunk that shows it well so aa 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.200
 difference that gives even so that the 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.780
 shift position of the camera then 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.230
 people fixing focus on main object 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.930
 that we want and that leaving blurring 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.780
 all these other elements on the front 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.060
 it will be on this main object that people 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.269
 You want to shoot ends up giving this 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.459
 fog print of a scenery 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.489
 maybe even romantic that we can 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:32.130
 leave it to our ideas 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.470
 so this video was just to show that 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.230
 a simple change of position from the 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.790
 already makes a big change in the 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.750
 our image that we can 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:45.510
 produce and can put other types 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.549
 of feelings within our image and 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.220
 This is what we should do as 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:53.070
 photographer to explore all these 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.220
 other points of view that exist in the 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.560
 that we often can not 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.600
 realize and it's good for us to train 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.310
 enough for us to realize 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.660
 this kind of thing 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.220
