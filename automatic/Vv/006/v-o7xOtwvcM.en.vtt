00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
visual inspection it is a good idea to

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.030 
visual inspection it is a good idea to
inspect<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.269> battery<00:02:30.420> charge<00:02:30.989> and<00:02:31.319> condition

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
inspect the battery charge and condition

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.240 
inspect the battery charge and condition
then<00:02:32.970> look<00:02:33.599> for<00:02:33.810> any<00:02:33.959> disconnected<00:02:34.739> or<00:02:34.890> miss

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
then look for any disconnected or miss

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.850 
then look for any disconnected or miss
routed<00:02:35.610> wires<00:02:35.880> or<00:02:36.180> hoses<00:02:36.599> you<00:02:36.810> may<00:02:37.319> also<00:02:37.500> look

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
routed wires or hoses you may also look

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.890 
routed wires or hoses you may also look
for<00:02:38.099> any<00:02:38.250> broken<00:02:38.610> or<00:02:38.879> miss<00:02:39.180> installed<00:02:39.599> parts

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
for any broken or miss installed parts

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.780 
for any broken or miss installed parts
we<00:02:42.900> can<00:02:43.079> start<00:02:43.410> and<00:02:43.650> run<00:02:43.799> the<00:02:43.920> engine<00:02:44.310> to<00:02:44.610> see

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
we can start and run the engine to see

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:51.380 
we can start and run the engine to see
if<00:02:44.910> it<00:02:45.030> is<00:02:45.150> running<00:02:45.390> properly<00:02:49.730> this<00:02:50.730> engine<00:02:51.209> is

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
if it is running properly this engine is

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.760 
if it is running properly this engine is
not

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.380 

we<00:02:57.770> can<00:02:57.950> also<00:02:58.099> see<00:02:58.490> that<00:02:58.640> the<00:02:58.790> check<00:02:59.000> engine

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
we can also see that the check engine

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:11.270 
we can also see that the check engine
light<00:02:59.540> is<00:02:59.569> on<00:02:59.870> so<00:03:00.140> we<00:03:00.890> know<00:03:01.040> there's<00:03:01.280> a<00:03:01.340> problem

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.030 

now<00:03:12.280> we<00:03:12.340> will<00:03:12.760> perform<00:03:13.000> step<00:03:13.660> three<00:03:14.110> a<00:03:14.320> vehicle

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
now we will perform step three a vehicle

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.660 
now we will perform step three a vehicle
system<00:03:15.550> check<00:03:15.850> including<00:03:16.540> scan<00:03:16.870> test<00:03:17.670> will

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
system check including scan test will

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.840 
system check including scan test will
scan<00:03:19.000> all<00:03:19.270> modules<00:03:19.950> for<00:03:20.950> diagnostic<00:03:21.520> trouble

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
scan all modules for diagnostic trouble

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:28.140 
scan all modules for diagnostic trouble
codes<00:03:23.700> and<00:03:25.200> we<00:03:26.200> can<00:03:26.410> see<00:03:26.590> that<00:03:26.800> the<00:03:26.950> PCM<00:03:27.490> has<00:03:28.120> a

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
codes and we can see that the PCM has a

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.270 
codes and we can see that the PCM has a
trouble<00:03:28.660> code<00:03:28.690> none<00:03:29.620> of<00:03:29.770> the<00:03:29.860> rest<00:03:30.040> of<00:03:30.220> the

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:38.550 
trouble code none of the rest of the
modules<00:03:30.700> have<00:03:30.820> any<00:03:31.209> code<00:03:31.510> stored<00:03:37.290> so<00:03:38.290> from

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
modules have any code stored so from

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.530 
modules have any code stored so from
here<00:03:38.800> we'll<00:03:39.010> go<00:03:39.040> and<00:03:39.430> look<00:03:39.580> and<00:03:39.760> see<00:03:39.940> what<00:03:40.240> code

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
here we'll go and look and see what code

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:59.900 
here we'll go and look and see what code
is<00:03:40.570> stored<00:03:41.170> in<00:03:41.470> the<00:03:42.100> PCM

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.290 

and<00:04:00.530> we<00:04:01.530> can<00:04:01.710> see<00:04:01.920> that<00:04:02.070> there's<00:04:02.280> a<00:04:02.340> p0<00:04:02.910> 300

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
and we can see that there's a p0 300

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.740 
and we can see that there's a p0 300
engine<00:04:04.260> misfire<00:04:04.710> detected<00:04:05.370> we<00:04:06.000> can<00:04:06.180> also<00:04:06.330> see

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
engine misfire detected we can also see

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.260 
engine misfire detected we can also see
that<00:04:07.380> the<00:04:07.560> mi<00:04:07.860> L<00:04:08.040> has<00:04:08.280> been<00:04:08.460> requested<00:04:09.030> so

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
that the mi L has been requested so

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.000 
that the mi L has been requested so
that's<00:04:09.450> the<00:04:09.660> reason<00:04:09.840> for<00:04:10.260> our<00:04:10.380> check<00:04:10.650> engine

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
that's the reason for our check engine

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:21.199 
that's the reason for our check engine
light<00:04:11.190> being<00:04:11.580> on<00:04:18.980> so<00:04:19.980> now<00:04:20.250> we'll<00:04:20.550> go<00:04:20.790> and<00:04:21.060> we'll

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
light being on so now we'll go and we'll

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.830 
light being on so now we'll go and we'll
capture<00:04:21.930> the<00:04:22.640> trouble<00:04:23.640> code<00:04:23.850> information

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
capture the trouble code information

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.780 
capture the trouble code information
onto<00:04:25.110> the<00:04:25.470> scanner<00:04:28.010> so<00:04:29.010> that<00:04:29.190> if<00:04:29.310> more<00:04:29.520> codes

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
onto the scanner so that if more codes

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.880 
onto the scanner so that if more codes
are<00:04:30.000> induced<00:04:30.360> during<00:04:30.690> testing<00:04:31.290> we'll<00:04:31.710> have<00:04:31.860> a

spark plug was worn and needed replacing

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:50.780 
spark plug was worn and needed replacing
that<00:06:48.220> was<00:06:48.400> the<00:06:48.580> cause<00:06:48.790> of<00:06:49.330> our<00:06:49.600> misfire<00:06:50.139> and

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:50.790 
that was the cause of our misfire and

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:57.150 
that was the cause of our misfire and
service<00:06:51.790> engine<00:06:52.150> soon<00:06:52.180> light<00:06:55.770> it<00:06:56.770> should<00:06:57.010> be

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:57.160 
service engine soon light it should be

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.490 
service engine soon light it should be
noted<00:06:57.550> to<00:06:57.700> always<00:06:58.090> use<00:06:58.300> professional<00:06:59.080> methods

00:06:59.490 --> 00:06:59.500

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:26.790 

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:29.030 

now<00:07:27.330> let's<00:07:27.600> verify<00:07:27.870> that<00:07:28.380> the<00:07:28.500> problem<00:07:28.920> is

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:29.040 
now let's verify that the problem is

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.520 
now let's verify that the problem is
completely<00:07:29.580> fixed<00:07:30.060> we<00:07:30.780> can<00:07:30.990> see<00:07:31.170> that<00:07:31.380> the

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:31.530 
completely fixed we can see that the

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:36.290 
completely fixed we can see that the
engine<00:07:31.890> is<00:07:32.040> running<00:07:32.100> just<00:07:32.640> fine<00:07:32.730> now<00:07:35.180> with<00:07:36.180> the

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:36.300 
engine is running just fine now with the

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.450 
engine is running just fine now with the
engine<00:07:36.660> running<00:07:36.710> there<00:07:37.710> is<00:07:37.740> no<00:07:38.010> longer<00:07:38.280> a

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:38.460 
engine running there is no longer a

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:42.920 
engine running there is no longer a
check<00:07:38.730> engine<00:07:38.910> light<00:07:39.120> on<00:07:41.180> and<00:07:42.180> we<00:07:42.510> can<00:07:42.720> see

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:42.930 
check engine light on and we can see

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:48.800 
check engine light on and we can see
that<00:07:43.140> there<00:07:43.350> are<00:07:43.380> no<00:07:43.680> trouble<00:07:44.160> codes<00:07:44.430> set<00:07:47.810> if

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:48.810 
that there are no trouble codes set if

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:51.140 
that there are no trouble codes set if
the<00:07:49.050> problem<00:07:49.470> was<00:07:49.500> not<00:07:49.920> completely<00:07:50.550> resolved

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:51.150 
the problem was not completely resolved

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.810 
the problem was not completely resolved
we<00:07:51.540> would<00:07:51.780> need<00:07:51.990> to<00:07:52.050> follow<00:07:52.800> the<00:07:53.130> chart<00:07:53.370> back

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:53.820 
we would need to follow the chart back

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:56.810 
we would need to follow the chart back
up<00:07:54.090> to<00:07:54.270> step<00:07:54.540> number<00:07:54.750> one<00:07:55.140> and<00:07:55.580> re-examine<00:07:56.580> the

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:56.820 
up to step number one and re-examine the

00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:03.050 
up to step number one and re-examine the
concern<00:08:00.500> if<00:08:01.500> the<00:08:01.740> problem<00:08:02.130> is<00:08:02.250> verified<00:08:02.730> to<00:08:02.940> be

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:03.060 
concern if the problem is verified to be

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:06.680 
concern if the problem is verified to be
fixed<00:08:03.510> then<00:08:03.810> we<00:08:03.960> are<00:08:04.080> done<00:08:04.380> I<00:08:05.690> recommend

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:06.690 
fixed then we are done I recommend
