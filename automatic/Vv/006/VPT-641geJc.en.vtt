00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.550
 oh a mistake 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:11.070
 hallucinate with each other 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:14.370
 today it's about a single speed 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.870
 project first I want to explain to you 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.720
 what is a single speed at all 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.880
 bike as you can on the screen 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.830
 it is a bicycle with one 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.359
 gear 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.609
 you still know the bikes back then 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.769
 from mutti or at that time from the ddr the 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.910
 has only one gang and they were quasi 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.160
 indestructible 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.840
 That is also the first reason you are 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.550
 virtually indestructible and very low maintenance 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.820
 which of course something cool again 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.539
 Moreover, they are very effective 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.410
 a very good run drove the 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:48.660
 efficiency is higher than one 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.070
 name circuit and you are too 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.160
 lighter than bicycles with a name 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.500
 Divorce as we can see you 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.329
 also make a lot of individual thing 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.320
 and that looks pretty cool too 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.879
 you can get different wheels zig 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.690
 different colors different 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.970
 build types 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.810
 This has already a small teeth 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.369
 There are two types of 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.710
 singlespeed once the normal 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.509
 singlespeed with freewheel that is if 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.960
 downhill him and learns can you just 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.360
 roll 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.670
 and then there is the fixe that is 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.159
 when you go down the mountain with her 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.450
 she is in it all the time 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.950
 not really the big ones right now 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.799
 but you can use it 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.549
 try it out then there is one more 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.000
 other reason 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.270
 You have an old mountain bike like that 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.270
 here 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.090
 and the circuit does not work 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.370
 more that was my old mountain bike 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.130
 After 14 years, the divorce has the 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.810
 ghost abandoned and now I have that 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.640
 simply converted to single speed it 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.890
 was two kilos lighter and that drives 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.150
 now again as 40 as pure have it mine 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.730
 cousin will be given only then 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.340
 he also drove 500 kilometers again 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.590
 can not complain 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:04.770
 works and here in berlin is no 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:09.210
 large terrain and therefore it is hardly one 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:12.660
 problem with this and just do it 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:16.650
 fun as you can see I have here 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:21.540
 a small chain tensioner inside the 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:23.880
 is because, for example, the frame 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.790
 here has no horizontal precipitate the 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.590
 the chain means I have to be exciting and 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.350
 Now with the room, I can just do that 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.580
 pull the wheel backwards 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:36.140
 This causes the chain tensioner to fall here 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:39.630
 away from home old road bike room too 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.490
 this kind and therefore the 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.470
 sometimes to immensely high prices gladly 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.120
 from four to five hundred euros easy 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.209
 because the light and the possibility 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.070
 have to tension the chain without tensioner 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.150
 but without joke with chains spanner she 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.070
 not so nice but it 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:58.220
 does not work fine 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:58.220
 problems like that 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.660
 then there is a second variant 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.880
 you just buy a finished one 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.160
 singlespeed ready like this 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.250
 cheap price everything nice everything cool 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:16.000
 looks fancy yes and then there is 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.000
 still red in black 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.040
 if everything was good the wheels and 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.660
 so are not too high quality for 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.000
 short tours okay was quick to 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.820
 shopping is going on as an antique loud bicycle 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.480
 But it is also so great fun 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:34.430
 you do not have with 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.230
 looks different, for example, in the 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.500
 bike already clear that's great 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:42.680
 I can not buddy of mine 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.480
 bought something like this 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.820
 a buddy of mine bought something now 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.330
 absolutely super frivolous super 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.560
 not really individual and 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.090
 that 's what the single speed is all about 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.500
 I can only drive with it and there I can 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.500
 I buy the same with my bike 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.590
 I think so a third variant man 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.400
 Just buy such a cheap 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:13.820
 bike okay and you just notice 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:15.100
 for example, the 210 euro and one alone 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:20.210
 frame 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.930
 150 euro expected as we need there 

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:23.630
 still mature 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.920
 we still need wheels we need 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.270
 still pedal we only need planing 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.840
 use only use a chain 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.940
 saddle 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.940
 we need brakes handlebar stem 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:38.630
 reflectors tubing and so on and 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.130
 there are some things yes and yes 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.630
 which are of course more expensive 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.340
 and that's the way to go 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.800
 get the bike and for example the 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.030
 Replace impellers 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.620
 For example, I do not plan it that way 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.850
 good and the wheels are not so good 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.830
 on the bike and you can easily 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.520
 replace 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:57.770
 Now, for example, do you hear that? 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.270
 wheelset and the bike and then has 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.730
 you ever for 400 euro something 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.500
 decent there you can someday 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:07.390
 let's know who do something individually 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.390
 we bring in other colors and stuff 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.139
 is unimportant 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:15.300
 always pay attention to the installation width here 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:22.439
 front is always the same and have the back 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:26.209
 we are 120mm singlespeed more often 

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:28.289
 actually always 120mm the rule 

00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:31.949
 How can I show you again briefly 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:36.719
 how many possibilities there are to the 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:38.849
 farm what you can do so for 

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:43.110
 example is now mario rispo 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:45.300
 Carbon pretty cool you can him 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.800
 really do all the crazy things 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.259
 You can also spend a lot of money there 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.439
 I have decided now 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:54.569
 to build my bike completely yourself 

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:58.529
 I'm just getting so brave I'll 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:06:01.289
 I'm probably in white and he me 

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:02.879
 it will not be cheap about 700 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:04.289
 euro costs the fun but I still have 

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:06.869
 a few things here will still be 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:08.699
 a bit cheaper and of course that 

00:06:06.869 --> 00:06:11.039
 team completely individual one has him 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:11.929
 completely own things one can complete 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:13.259
 according to your own needs 

00:06:11.929 --> 00:06:16.829
 compile 

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:18.749
 that's something special you know 

00:06:16.829 --> 00:06:22.229
 are also what you have installed so is 

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:25.829
 as if you buy the cane soup 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:28.259
 or as if you are cooking something yourself and yes 

00:06:25.829 --> 00:06:29.849
 that's the cool thing and it's one 

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:32.569
 Quite a job I enjoy 

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:36.779
 sometimes he is less fun 

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:39.539
 yes and that's it within the next 

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:42.449
 video I show you wettteil arrived 

00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:44.550
 are and i hope i could get you one 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:47.579
 Little clear what's up with the singles 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:50.279
 with bicycles on it has one more 

00:06:47.579 --> 00:06:52.619
 thing if you are in very mountainous country 

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:55.619
 dwell lets the fingers of it buys 

00:06:52.619 --> 00:06:57.719
 rather mountain bike or road bike than in 

00:06:55.619 --> 00:07:01.439
 Flachland does not live in Hamburg 

00:06:57.719 --> 00:07:02.879
 Berlin or wherever no problem 

00:07:01.439 --> 00:07:04.369
 there you can the things without problems 

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:09.300
 drive that is very effective 

00:07:04.369 --> 00:07:12.749
 and yes you can to 35 40 already loose 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:14.009
 So I can tell you that 

00:07:12.749 --> 00:07:15.869
 drive really fast and you 

00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:17.090
 can still go there you can fit like 

00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:21.680
 you want 

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:24.580
 good thanks for seeing you and see you 

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.580
 next video
