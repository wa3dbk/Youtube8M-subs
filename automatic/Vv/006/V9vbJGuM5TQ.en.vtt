00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.270
 since the beginning of the hamas time too 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.410
 there are frequent increases in 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.570
 fuel ne 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.150
 so let's give some tips for 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.790
 you save fuel 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.359
 in the day to day the first tip that I give 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:22.320
 is calibration of tires you calibrate the 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:25.170
 weekly tire because the waned tire 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.630
 you have a bigger drag of the motor car 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.269
 It will make more force in the car to walk. 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.989
 ends up spending another fuel 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:38.040
 The tip I give is the way to drive. 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:40.200
 acceleration is accelerating the 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.059
 car unnecessarily there in front of you 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.440
 the traffic light is closed you are still 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.480
 speeding up 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.610
 get in there and brake from that more 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.030
 strong in the traffic light sometimes the person 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.660
 complains about the consumption of the car but the 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:59.399
 use the car in a very short distance 5 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.440
 kms less than 5 from the house to the service there 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.449
 on this route 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.369
 Are you working with the motor in the 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.770
 cold when the engine is still 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.030
 growing to the ideal temperature 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.520
 of operation 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.360
 in this period the car has a consumption 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.619
 bigger 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:19.770
 already the person that has a course of 20km 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.960
 for example at her house to the service 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.630
 she will spend more fuel because the 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.330
 longer course but consumption of the 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.119
 car in this case it can be much better 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.299
 than the person who uses the car I 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.060
 I know very short and the tip most 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.420
 important to keep the review up to date 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.640
 the dirty air filter interferes with the 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.369
 fuel consumption 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.680
 in them are also interfering with the 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.040
 fuel consumption 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.079
 ie a periodic review of the car 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.960
 you will be spending on the review but 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.280
 We're already saving at the time of 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.850
 fuel your car 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.240
 A final tip is you put in your 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.340
 car with good fuel 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.560
 to give up on the market several 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.800
 gasoline and that to obtain a 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.620
 you are saving on the pump and 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.420
 spending on consumption and maintenance if 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.810
 You suddenly do the math . 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.420
 cheap gasoline will get more expensive than 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.550
 that good quality petrol and 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.060
 good quality gasoline depends a lot on 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:30.319
 of the owner of the post there are the flags 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.900
 known in the market but always 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.870
 you look for an owner of 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.830
 trust that well you will not 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.720
 have problem 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.610
 the site will also help you in 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.160
 fuel we have two more videos 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.000
 about this subject is just click on 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.100
 watch 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.100
 That's it, guys, until next time.
