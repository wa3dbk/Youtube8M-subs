00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 Barbara Schöneberger here at the moderation of Mongolia and a great 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.930
 Appear for the reduction of the other parts of the Bundeswehr 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.389
 Student a creates 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:14.349
 because I say that this is not easy Liso a stab in the heart that 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.289
 is my dress what is there then it is not mean Seiser worse 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:19.640
 It can not be 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.210
 he was so happy with the young designer that Barbara Schöneberger now 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.970
 belong to the clientele 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.220
 She has the hand-made silk dress for the prominent presenter 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.810
 Worked up from the first draft summit to the finished piece makes the 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.460
 26-year-old had Phelps, the model is 1 percent 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.639
 Dorsten way shows that it is the original dress 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.440
 this model was then copied in the color green I do not know the provider 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.760
 I offer none of his clothes in the carriageway 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.160
 how Barbara Schöneberger was wearing the Jula and therefore I am 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.390
 can not be sure that it will not do it 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.480
 but how does the presenter come to Karmann's customers? 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.930
 she has the simplified knees designer tee July 11 o'clock 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.870
 then decide for myself i had my dress here so well that they said 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.830
 once copying has 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:11.930
 but 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.850
 it's just terrible community 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.950
 I hold the right of her table to initiate steps as I want to 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.280
 that 's the reason I have the copyrights I also have the 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.500
 Protection logged in and percent 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.270
 another than Intel's processors 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.700
 I would have given him any rights APA as I said that you want 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.759
 not really i want to avoid that because i think that you look 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:33.800
 on too 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.900
 also earlier 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.930
 can handle peaceful ways 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.500
 but there can be no talk of that at the moment 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.110
 The prominent blonde is for the fashion designer not to speak 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.370
 also in management concern the accusations are not expressed 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.650
 while the young designer has a great proposal for the fashion conscious 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.720
 moderators 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.350
 Eichberger ITRI is giving away eleven of me to give insider sources 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.330
 and is in return as it were advertised 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.450
 We are curious if Barbara Schöneberger the generous offer 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:05.760
 some
