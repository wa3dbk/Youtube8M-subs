like<00:00:54.440> brand-new<00:00:55.640> except<00:00:56.640> where<00:00:56.760> there<00:00:56.850> are

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.150 
like brand-new except where there are

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.439 
like brand-new except where there are
like<00:00:58.100> on<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.280> low<00:00:59.430> like<00:00:59.580> turn<00:00:59.850> watt<00:01:00.089> class

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
like on this low like turn watt class

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.119 
like on this low like turn watt class
thing<00:01:00.839> there's<00:01:01.080> some<00:01:01.290> like<00:01:01.470> where<00:01:01.769> on<00:01:02.010> the

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
thing there's some like where on the

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.829 
thing there's some like where on the
metal<00:01:02.670> but<00:01:02.879> that's<00:01:03.119> I<00:01:03.449> mean<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.720> would

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:03.839 
metal but that's I mean that would

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:05.390 
metal but that's I mean that would
happen<00:01:04.170> no<00:01:04.290> matter<00:01:04.350> what<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.220> can't

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
happen no matter what and you can't

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.539 
happen no matter what and you can't
really<00:01:05.580> fix<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:06.229> and<00:01:07.229> um<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:08.070> straps<00:01:08.340> I

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
really fix that and um the straps I

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.070 
really fix that and um the straps I
think<00:01:08.729> on<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.090> edges<00:01:09.420> it's<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.659> little<00:01:09.869> bit<00:01:09.990> of

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
think on the edges it's a little bit of

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.480 
think on the edges it's a little bit of
there's<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.469> little<00:01:10.500> wear<00:01:10.829> but<00:01:11.070> it's<00:01:11.219> not<00:01:11.310> that

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
there's a little wear but it's not that

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.270 
there's a little wear but it's not that
big<00:01:11.609> of<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.759> deal<00:01:11.909> so<00:01:12.320> I'm<00:01:13.320> just<00:01:13.530> so<00:01:13.710> excited<00:01:13.829> to

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
big of a deal so I'm just so excited to

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.770 
big of a deal so I'm just so excited to
have<00:01:14.399> this<00:01:14.609> because<00:01:14.969> I<00:01:15.090> really<00:01:15.329> like<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.689> I

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
have this because I really like it I

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.910 
have this because I really like it I
also<00:01:15.960> like<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.649> was<00:01:17.250> also<00:01:17.430> looking<00:01:17.609> for<00:01:17.939> on<00:01:18.240> I

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
also like I was also looking for on I

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.529 
also like I was also looking for on I
forget<00:01:19.920> what<00:01:20.100> style<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.579> is<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.880> think<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.359> would

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:21.539 
forget what style it is I think it would

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:25.760 
forget what style it is I think it would
be<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.920> court<00:01:22.920> bag<00:01:23.789> I<00:01:24.380> think<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.500> don't<00:01:25.679> know

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
be the court bag I think I don't know

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.560 
be the court bag I think I don't know
but<00:01:25.979> there's<00:01:26.250> some<00:01:26.549> other<00:01:26.640> cells<00:01:27.030> I<00:01:27.240> really

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
but there's some other cells I really

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.389 
but there's some other cells I really
like<00:01:27.750> too<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.020> hopefully<00:01:28.590> maybe<00:01:28.890> one<00:01:29.100> day<00:01:29.280> we'll

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
like too I hopefully maybe one day we'll

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:32.359 
like too I hopefully maybe one day we'll
find<00:01:30.020> okay<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.079> I<00:01:31.229> guess<00:01:31.439> I'll<00:01:31.619> just<00:01:31.649> get<00:01:32.250> into

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
find okay so I guess I'll just get into

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:32.810 
find okay so I guess I'll just get into
it

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
it

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.410 
it
so<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.780> has<00:01:33.929> a<00:01:33.960> short<00:01:34.859> strap<00:01:35.700> right<00:01:35.909> here<00:01:36.210> and

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
so it has a short strap right here and

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.859 
so it has a short strap right here and
then<00:01:36.539> this<00:01:36.689> long<00:01:36.979> strap<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:39.390> obviously

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
then this long strap and I obviously

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.270 
then this long strap and I obviously
don't<00:01:40.140> care<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.499> by<00:01:40.649> this<00:01:40.859> stroke<00:01:41.130> because

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
don't care it by this stroke because

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.789 
don't care it by this stroke because
that's<00:01:41.429> kind<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.670> strange<00:01:41.909> um<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:43.320> always<00:01:43.530> just

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
that's kind of strange um I always just

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.169 
that's kind of strange um I always just
kind<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:44.039> put<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.399> around<00:01:44.490> on<00:01:44.759> my<00:01:44.880> shoulder

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
kind of put it around on my shoulder

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:47.569 
kind of put it around on my shoulder
like<00:01:45.329> this<00:01:45.390> okay<00:01:46.109> so<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.320> had<00:01:46.499> this<00:01:46.679> one<00:01:46.920> pocket

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579
