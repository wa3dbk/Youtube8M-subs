we need to move the treadmill down to

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.620 
we need to move the treadmill down to
0.5<00:02:58.340> get<00:02:59.340> it<00:02:59.430> very<00:02:59.700> very<00:02:59.880> slow<00:03:00.210> so<00:03:00.450> that's

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
0.5 get it very very slow so that's

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.690 
0.5 get it very very slow so that's
safer<00:03:00.990> you're<00:03:01.800> still<00:03:01.980> going<00:03:02.100> to<00:03:02.130> get<00:03:02.280> just<00:03:02.550> as

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
safer you're still going to get just as

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.090 
safer you're still going to get just as
much<00:03:02.820> out<00:03:03.000> of<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.180> exercise<00:03:03.830> now<00:03:04.830> it's<00:03:05.010> a

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
much out of the exercise now it's a

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.190 
much out of the exercise now it's a
ballistic<00:03:05.580> plyometric<00:03:06.210> type<00:03:06.420> lunge<00:03:06.690> you're

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200
