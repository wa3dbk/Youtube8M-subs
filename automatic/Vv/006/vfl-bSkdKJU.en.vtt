00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
in the microwave for about three minutes

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.550 
in the microwave for about three minutes
and<00:02:12.280> then<00:02:12.850> take<00:02:13.060> it<00:02:13.090> out<00:02:13.270> stir<00:02:13.720> it<00:02:13.930> and<00:02:14.170> check

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
and then take it out stir it and check

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.740 
and then take it out stir it and check
on<00:02:14.740> it<00:02:14.890> and<00:02:14.920> make<00:02:15.250> sure<00:02:15.280> you<00:02:15.520> know<00:02:15.820> it's<00:02:15.970> if<00:02:16.600> it

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
on it and make sure you know it's if it

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:17.910 
on it and make sure you know it's if it
needs<00:02:16.930> more<00:02:17.020> cooking<00:02:17.410> with<00:02:17.560> middle<00:02:17.770> for

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
needs more cooking with middle for

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.070 
needs more cooking with middle for
another<00:02:18.070> minute<00:02:18.459> or<00:02:18.490> so<00:02:18.610> that's<00:02:19.420> about<00:02:19.600> it<00:02:19.810> and

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
another minute or so that's about it and

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.840 
another minute or so that's about it and
you're<00:02:20.260> not<00:02:20.290> looking<00:02:20.739> for<00:02:21.040> it<00:02:21.250> to<00:02:21.370> cook<00:02:21.550> all

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
you're not looking for it to cook all

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.370 
you're not looking for it to cook all
the<00:02:21.970> way<00:02:22.000> through<00:02:22.120> this<00:02:22.480> is<00:02:22.690> kind<00:02:22.989> of<00:02:23.050> a<00:02:23.140> half

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
the way through this is kind of a half

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.290 
the way through this is kind of a half
cook<00:02:23.709> because<00:02:24.340> again<00:02:24.580> it<00:02:24.760> is<00:02:24.850> gonna<00:02:25.000> go<00:02:25.180> into

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
cook because again it is gonna go into

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.300 
cook because again it is gonna go into
the<00:02:25.450> oven<00:02:25.540> for<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.200> night<00:02:26.380> time<00:02:26.650> and<00:02:27.010> then<00:02:27.190> it

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
the oven for the night time and then it

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.160 
the oven for the night time and then it
just<00:02:27.489> speeds<00:02:27.760> up<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.030> process<00:02:28.060> of<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.750> oven

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
just speeds up the process of the oven

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
just speeds up the process of the oven
so<00:02:31.230> after<00:02:32.230> all<00:02:32.260> we<00:02:32.440> want<00:02:32.680> a<00:02:32.709> quick<00:02:32.920> snack

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
so after all we want a quick snack

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.590 
so after all we want a quick snack
that's<00:02:33.880> true

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
that's true

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.470 
that's true
so<00:02:34.959> in<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:35.320> microwave<00:02:35.709> this<00:02:35.830> goes<00:02:36.480> potatoes

00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:19.839 
sticking on to the potatoes really well
if<00:06:18.349> you<00:06:18.559> introduce<00:06:18.800> water<00:06:19.249> and<00:06:19.459> that<00:06:19.669> makes

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:19.849 
if you introduce water and that makes

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:22.389 
if you introduce water and that makes
all<00:06:20.089> the<00:06:20.509> spices<00:06:21.259> will<00:06:21.409> kind<00:06:21.589> of<00:06:21.649> sit<00:06:22.189> at<00:06:22.369> the

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:22.399 
all the spices will kind of sit at the

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:24.100 
all the spices will kind of sit at the
bottom<00:06:22.639> and<00:06:23.059> it<00:06:23.539> won't<00:06:23.659> flavor<00:06:23.899> the<00:06:24.019> potatoes

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.110 
bottom and it won't flavor the potatoes

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:29.199 
bottom and it won't flavor the potatoes
so<00:06:24.769> and<00:06:25.339> we<00:06:25.519> want<00:06:25.699> them<00:06:25.849> nice<00:06:25.999> and<00:06:26.029> dry<00:06:28.209> and

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:32.449 
we're going to pour this now on to the

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:40.209 
we're going to pour this now on to the
sheet<00:06:32.719> baking<00:06:33.229> sheet<00:06:38.769> good<00:06:39.769> thing<00:06:39.949> would<00:06:40.099> be

00:06:40.209 --> 00:06:40.219 
sheet baking sheet good thing would be

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:43.179 
sheet baking sheet good thing would be
to<00:06:40.369> try<00:06:40.610> and<00:06:40.789> spread<00:06:40.969> it<00:06:41.149> out<00:06:41.829> so<00:06:42.829> that's<00:06:43.039> why

00:06:43.179 --> 00:06:43.189 
to try and spread it out so that's why

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:51.249
