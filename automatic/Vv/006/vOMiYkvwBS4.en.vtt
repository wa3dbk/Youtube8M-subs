00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
going to die to two earthquakes I'm

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.440 
going to die to two earthquakes I'm
actually<00:02:07.290> special<00:02:08.190> defensive<00:02:08.790> feature<00:02:09.000> so

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
actually special defensive feature so

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.340 
actually special defensive feature so
that's<00:02:09.810> why<00:02:09.980> one<00:02:10.980> was<00:02:11.400> not<00:02:11.700> enough<00:02:12.020> as<00:02:13.020> now

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
that's why one was not enough as now

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.230 
that's why one was not enough as now
because<00:02:13.650> in<00:02:13.800> two<00:02:13.890> actors<00:02:14.190> not<00:02:14.550> really<00:02:14.850> worried

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
because in two actors not really worried

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.300 
because in two actors not really worried
adults<00:02:16.080> when<00:02:16.230> he's<00:02:16.380> gonna<00:02:16.500> set<00:02:16.740> up<00:02:16.830> my<00:02:16.860> style

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
rocks and suppose you have to go for the

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.730 
rocks and suppose you have to go for the
crunch<00:02:21.210> here<00:02:21.720> because<00:02:22.020> it<00:02:22.140> does<00:02:22.290> more<00:02:22.530> with

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
crunch here because it does more with
