00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
I start I want to have a little bit of a

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.240 
I start I want to have a little bit of a
disclaimer<00:00:20.359> right<00:00:20.810> here<00:00:21.199> I've<00:00:21.470> never<00:00:21.890> seen<00:00:22.220> a

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250 
disclaimer right here I've never seen a

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.159 
disclaimer right here I've never seen a
single<00:00:22.669> episode<00:00:22.910> not<00:00:23.390> even<00:00:23.630> so<00:00:23.810> much<00:00:23.869> as<00:00:24.140> a

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:24.169 
single episode not even so much as a

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:26.679 
single episode not even so much as a
single<00:00:24.410> clip<00:00:24.800> of<00:00:25.130> the<00:00:25.310> show<00:00:25.490> Danny<00:00:25.820> Phantom<00:00:26.179> so

despite<00:00:27.109> some<00:00:27.380> pretty<00:00:27.650> extensive<00:00:28.039> research<00:00:28.699> I

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
despite some pretty extensive research I

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.050 
despite some pretty extensive research I
may<00:00:29.449> miss<00:00:29.720> big<00:00:30.050> so<00:00:30.289> if<00:00:30.439> I<00:00:30.560> do

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
may miss big so if I do

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.940 
may miss big so if I do

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
don't don't whine about it please now

that<00:00:33.980> that's<00:00:34.250> out<00:00:34.460> of<00:00:34.520> the<00:00:34.700> way<00:00:34.730> we<00:00:35.000> can<00:00:35.180> dive

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
that that's out of the way we can dive

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.660 
that that's out of the way we can dive
right<00:00:35.660> into<00:00:36.110> this<00:00:36.380> theory<00:00:36.920> which<00:00:37.130> says<00:00:37.400> that

right into this theory which says that

Danny Phantom theories in fairly
oddparents<00:00:53.930> theories<00:00:54.290> quite<00:00:54.800> a<00:00:54.830> bit<00:00:55.100> so<00:00:55.280> I

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:55.310 
oddparents theories quite a bit so I

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.040 
oddparents theories quite a bit so I
figured<00:00:55.790> I'd<00:00:56.120> kill<00:00:56.390> two<00:00:56.450> birds<00:00:56.840> with<00:00:56.960> one

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
figured I'd kill two birds with one

figured I'd kill two birds with one
stone<00:00:57.200> now<00:00:57.980> from<00:00:58.160> what<00:00:58.280> I<00:00:58.310> can<00:00:58.400> tell<00:00:58.550> this

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
stone now from what I can tell this

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.480 
stone now from what I can tell this
theory<00:00:59.480> originated<00:01:00.110> from<00:01:00.230> a<00:01:00.440> tumblr<00:01:00.950> post<00:01:01.190> and

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:01.490 
theory originated from a tumblr post and

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.100 
theory originated from a tumblr post and
if<00:01:01.550> you<00:01:01.640> guys<00:01:01.760> know<00:01:01.820> anything<00:01:02.510> about<00:01:02.600> me

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
if you guys know anything about me

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.920 
if you guys know anything about me
I<00:01:03.140> really<00:01:04.040> hate<00:01:04.280> tumblr<00:01:04.790> so<00:01:04.820> it<00:01:05.119> kind<00:01:05.479> of<00:01:05.630> pains

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
I really hate tumblr so it kind of pains

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.529 
I really hate tumblr so it kind of pains
me<00:01:06.200> to<00:01:06.409> talk<00:01:06.799> about<00:01:07.009> it<00:01:07.369> basically<00:01:07.939> someone<00:01:08.329> on

00:01:08.529 --> 00:01:08.539 
me to talk about it basically someone on

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:10.239 
me to talk about it basically someone on
tumblr<00:01:08.749> noticed<00:01:09.350> that<00:01:09.499> there<00:01:09.679> are<00:01:09.829> a<00:01:09.890> lot<00:01:10.219> of

00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:10.249 
tumblr noticed that there are a lot of

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:12.279 
tumblr noticed that there are a lot of
characters<00:01:10.969> and<00:01:11.149> Fairly<00:01:11.509> OddParents<00:01:12.079> that

00:01:12.279 --> 00:01:12.289 
characters and Fairly OddParents that

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:13.929 
characters and Fairly OddParents that
look<00:01:12.530> like<00:01:12.740> characters<00:01:13.189> from<00:01:13.249> Danny<00:01:13.640> Phantom

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:13.939 
look like characters from Danny Phantom

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:16.300 
look like characters from Danny Phantom
for<00:01:14.539> example<00:01:14.990> both<00:01:15.170> Danny's<00:01:15.710> parents<00:01:15.950> and

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
for example both Danny's parents and

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.489 
for example both Danny's parents and
Timmy's<00:01:16.909> parents<00:01:17.149> do<00:01:17.539> look<00:01:17.869> kind<00:01:18.200> of<00:01:18.289> similar

00:01:18.489 --> 00:01:18.499 
Timmy's parents do look kind of similar

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:20.919 
Timmy's parents do look kind of similar
not<00:01:19.069> necessarily<00:01:19.729> identical<00:01:20.509> but<00:01:20.689> they<00:01:20.869> do

00:01:20.919 --> 00:01:20.929 
not necessarily identical but they do

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:23.620 
not necessarily identical but they do
have<00:01:21.469> very<00:01:21.829> similar<00:01:22.130> physical<00:01:22.729> traits<00:01:23.090> not

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
have very similar physical traits not

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.120 
have very similar physical traits not
only<00:01:23.929> that<00:01:24.109> but<00:01:24.259> from<00:01:24.409> what<00:01:24.560> I've<00:01:24.679> read<00:01:24.920> they

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
only that but from what I've read they

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.639 
only that but from what I've read they
also<00:01:25.399> have<00:01:25.819> somewhat<00:01:26.299> similar<00:01:26.649> personality

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
also have somewhat similar personality

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:30.099 
also have somewhat similar personality
so<00:01:27.950> there's<00:01:28.399> that<00:01:28.759> not<00:01:29.270> only<00:01:29.539> them<00:01:29.780> but<00:01:29.810> if<00:01:30.079> we

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:30.109 
so there's that not only them but if we

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:32.139 
so there's that not only them but if we
compare<00:01:30.679> the<00:01:30.859> side<00:01:31.189> characters<00:01:31.549> of<00:01:31.999> the<00:01:32.119> show

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
compare the side characters of the show

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:34.090 
compare the side characters of the show
their<00:01:32.840> physical<00:01:33.259> appearances<00:01:33.770> are<00:01:33.920> pretty

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
their physical appearances are pretty

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.069 
their physical appearances are pretty
similar<00:01:34.369> as<00:01:34.670> well<00:01:34.909> we've<00:01:35.329> got<00:01:35.539> the<00:01:35.689> token

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
similar as well we've got the token

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:38.559 
similar as well we've got the token
black<00:01:36.259> kid<00:01:36.770> we<00:01:37.069> have<00:01:37.219> the<00:01:37.369> trailer-trash<00:01:38.179> kid

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
we have the girl that Timmy has a crush

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.279 
we have the girl that Timmy has a crush
on<00:01:40.340> basically<00:01:41.060> all<00:01:41.389> of<00:01:41.659> the<00:01:41.749> characters<00:01:42.139> from

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:42.289 
on basically all of the characters from

fairy world instead there is a ghost

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000 
fairy world instead there is a ghost
world<00:02:55.480> so<00:02:55.989> basically<00:02:56.470> what<00:02:56.620> people<00:02:56.650> are

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
world so basically what people are

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.130 
world so basically what people are
theorizing<00:02:57.280> is<00:02:57.819> that<00:02:58.030> because<00:02:58.540> of<00:02:58.569> Timmy's

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
theorizing is that because of Timmy's

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.619 
theorizing is that because of Timmy's
wish<00:02:59.440> he<00:02:59.950> was<00:03:00.099> transported<00:03:00.819> to<00:03:00.849> an<00:03:01.000> alternate

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:01.629 
wish he was transported to an alternate

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:03.539 
wish he was transported to an alternate
universe<00:03:01.660> which<00:03:02.379> is<00:03:02.410> basically<00:03:02.980> kind<00:03:03.220> of<00:03:03.370> a

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
universe which is basically kind of a

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.270 
universe which is basically kind of a
parallel<00:03:04.180> to<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:04.959> universe<00:03:05.379> that<00:03:05.530> he<00:03:05.739> was<00:03:05.920> in

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
parallel to the universe that he was in

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.069 
parallel to the universe that he was in
so<00:03:06.730> basically<00:03:07.180> Timmy<00:03:07.540> and<00:03:07.750> all<00:03:07.840> of<00:03:07.959> his

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:09.960 
so basically Timmy and all of his
friends<00:03:08.260> go<00:03:08.560> from<00:03:08.829> being<00:03:09.010> children<00:03:09.519> to<00:03:09.760> being

friends go from being children to being

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.059 
friends go from being children to being
teenagers<00:03:10.569> instead<00:03:11.349> of<00:03:11.440> the<00:03:11.560> fairy<00:03:11.859> world

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069
