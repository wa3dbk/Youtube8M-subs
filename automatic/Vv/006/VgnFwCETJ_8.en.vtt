00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.410 
you hold down the spacebar it'll turn
any<00:00:23.180> tool<00:00:23.450> into<00:00:23.750> the<00:00:24.500> move<00:00:24.710> tool<00:00:24.950> so<00:00:25.670> you<00:00:25.700> can

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
any tool into the move tool so you can

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.870 
any tool into the move tool so you can
move<00:00:27.320> around<00:00:27.470> the<00:00:27.680> image<00:00:27.920> and<00:00:28.130> let's

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
move around the image and let's

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.340 
move around the image and let's
duplicate<00:00:29.300> our<00:00:29.330> layer<00:00:29.540> by<00:00:29.810> grabbing<00:00:30.170> the

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:30.350 
duplicate our layer by grabbing the

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.080 
duplicate our layer by grabbing the
background<00:00:30.710> layer<00:00:30.860> and<00:00:31.100> dragging<00:00:31.880> it<00:00:31.970> to<00:00:32.000> the

new layer icon this will allow us to

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.790 
new layer icon this will allow us to
work<00:00:35.180> on<00:00:35.510> a<00:00:35.630> duplicate<00:00:36.050> as<00:00:36.230> opposed<00:00:36.560> to<00:00:36.650> your

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
work on a duplicate as opposed to your

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.950 
work on a duplicate as opposed to your
original<00:00:36.950> we<00:00:37.400> can<00:00:37.520> always<00:00:37.700> go<00:00:37.790> back<00:00:37.820> and<00:00:38.270> the

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
original we can always go back and the

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.540 
original we can always go back and the
first<00:00:39.170> time<00:00:39.410> going<00:00:39.500> to<00:00:39.560> show<00:00:39.710> you<00:00:39.770> is<00:00:40.040> the

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
first time going to show you is the

clone tool which is in the tool bar over

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.600 
clone tool which is in the tool bar over
here<00:00:43.340> looks<00:00:43.850> like<00:00:43.970> a<00:00:44.000> little<00:00:44.240> stamp<00:00:44.450> and

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
here looks like a little stamp and

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.190 
here looks like a little stamp and
keyboard<00:00:46.610> shortcut<00:00:46.880> for<00:00:46.910> that<00:00:47.060> is<00:00:47.150> s<00:00:47.390> so<00:00:48.020> we

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
keyboard shortcut for that is s so we

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.500 
keyboard shortcut for that is s so we
choose<00:00:48.380> that<00:00:48.590> and<00:00:48.800> what<00:00:49.040> this<00:00:49.220> does<00:00:49.520> is<00:00:49.790> it

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
choose that and what this does is it

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.150 
choose that and what this does is it
actually<00:00:50.810> allows<00:00:50.960> you<00:00:51.140> to<00:00:51.320> clone<00:00:51.620> a<00:00:51.860> part<00:00:52.100> of

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
actually allows you to clone a part of

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.710 
actually allows you to clone a part of
the<00:00:52.220> image<00:00:52.489> and<00:00:52.700> use<00:00:53.180> it<00:00:53.329> somewhere<00:00:53.570> else

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
the image and use it somewhere else

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.870 
the image and use it somewhere else
within<00:00:54.050> the<00:00:54.140> image

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:55.880 
within the image

and the difference between those are
this<00:01:07.420> to<00:01:08.420> use<00:01:08.570> this<00:01:08.720> tool<00:01:08.930> you<00:01:09.050> have<00:01:09.080> to<00:01:09.230> sample

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
this to use this tool you have to sample

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.340 
this to use this tool you have to sample
an<00:01:09.740> area<00:01:10.040> on<00:01:10.520> the<00:01:10.610> subject<00:01:11.180> and<00:01:11.300> to<00:01:12.050> do<00:01:12.170> that

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
an area on the subject and to do that

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.470 
an area on the subject and to do that
you<00:01:12.560> hold<00:01:12.740> down<00:01:12.890> alt<00:01:13.100> or<00:01:13.220> option<00:01:13.400> and<00:01:13.730> it<00:01:14.240> turns

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:14.480 
you hold down alt or option and it turns

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.620 
you hold down alt or option and it turns
into<00:01:14.630> a<00:01:14.780> crosshair<00:01:15.290> and<00:01:15.550> then<00:01:16.550> you<00:01:16.790> click<00:01:17.390> once

painting<00:01:47.680> so<00:01:48.680> no<00:01:49.220> matter<00:01:49.340> when<00:01:49.729> you<00:01:49.759> let<00:01:50.210> go

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
painting so no matter when you let go

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.300 
painting so no matter when you let go
and<00:01:50.420> you<00:01:50.720> start<00:01:50.960> to<00:01:51.140> click<00:01:51.290> again<00:01:51.560> it<00:01:52.130> will

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
and you start to click again it will

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.950 
and you start to click again it will
always<00:01:52.520> align<00:01:52.880> itself<00:01:53.210> so<00:01:53.450> now<00:01:53.600> it's<00:01:53.750> up<00:01:53.840> in

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
always align itself so now it's up in

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.450 
always align itself so now it's up in
the<00:01:54.050> hair<00:01:54.229> and<00:01:54.470> if<00:01:54.619> I<00:01:54.710> go<00:01:54.830> down<00:01:54.860> you<00:01:55.130> can<00:01:55.250> see<00:01:55.430> it

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
the hair and if I go down you can see it

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.520 
the hair and if I go down you can see it
now<00:01:55.700> on<00:01:55.820> the<00:01:55.880> forehead<00:01:56.210> it's<00:01:56.990> always<00:01:57.380> going<00:01:57.470> to

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
now on the forehead it's always going to

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.140 
now on the forehead it's always going to
be<00:01:57.619> that<00:01:57.890> distance<00:01:58.130> away<00:01:58.460> and<00:01:58.729> paint<00:01:58.970> that

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
be that distance away and paint that

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.330 
be that distance away and paint that
part<00:01:59.390> of<00:01:59.450> the<00:01:59.540> image<00:01:59.750> so<00:02:00.020> let's<00:02:00.740> undo<00:02:01.220> that<00:02:01.690> and

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
part of the image so let's undo that and

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.620 
part of the image so let's undo that and
let<00:02:04.340> me<00:02:04.429> show<00:02:04.610> you<00:02:04.670> what<00:02:05.000> happens<00:02:05.420> when<00:02:05.539> you

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
let me show you what happens when you

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.779 
let me show you what happens when you
don't<00:02:05.750> use<00:02:05.869> aligned<00:02:06.259> if<00:02:06.860> you<00:02:07.069> uncheck<00:02:07.250> aligned

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
don't use aligned if you uncheck aligned

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:10.450 
don't use aligned if you uncheck aligned
and<00:02:08.000> we<00:02:08.929> sample<00:02:09.350> the<00:02:09.440> eye<00:02:09.470> by<00:02:09.830> using<00:02:10.130> the<00:02:10.280> alt

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
and we sample the eye by using the alt

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.870 
and we sample the eye by using the alt
or<00:02:10.610> option<00:02:10.670> key<00:02:10.970> and<00:02:11.500> clicking<00:02:12.500> and<00:02:13.430> we<00:02:13.640> start

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
or option key and clicking and we start

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.220 
or option key and clicking and we start
to<00:02:13.970> paint<00:02:14.120> down<00:02:14.300> here<00:02:14.540> it<00:02:14.720> will<00:02:14.810> paint<00:02:15.050> the<00:02:15.200> eye

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
to paint down here it will paint the eye

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.370 
to paint down here it will paint the eye
and<00:02:15.680> if<00:02:16.400> we<00:02:16.550> let<00:02:16.700> go<00:02:16.940> and<00:02:17.540> we<00:02:17.810> start<00:02:18.110> to<00:02:18.200> paint

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
and if we let go and we start to paint

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.770 
and if we let go and we start to paint
over<00:02:18.470> here<00:02:18.560> it<00:02:18.890> will<00:02:19.010> paint<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.340> eye<00:02:19.370> again

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
over here it will paint the eye again

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.090 
over here it will paint the eye again
basically<00:02:20.780> you<00:02:20.870> have<00:02:20.990> sampled<00:02:21.470> that<00:02:21.590> area<00:02:21.950> and

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
basically you have sampled that area and

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.970 
basically you have sampled that area and
it's<00:02:22.250> always<00:02:22.640> going<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:22.819> paint<00:02:23.060> that<00:02:23.980> the

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
it's always going to paint that the

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.610 
it's always going to paint that the
reference<00:02:25.400> point<00:02:25.670> of<00:02:25.850> where<00:02:26.060> you<00:02:26.180> sampled<00:02:26.630> so

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
reference point of where you sampled so

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.800 
reference point of where you sampled so
let's<00:02:27.920> undo<00:02:28.220> that<00:02:28.250> and<00:02:28.670> I<00:02:29.030> generally<00:02:29.420> tend<00:02:29.750> to

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
let's undo that and I generally tend to

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.250 
let's undo that and I generally tend to
work<00:02:30.110> with<00:02:30.410> the<00:02:30.830> aligned<00:02:31.220> box<00:02:31.640> unchecked<00:02:32.260> so

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
work with the aligned box unchecked so

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.559 
work with the aligned box unchecked so
that<00:02:33.410> I<00:02:33.620> can<00:02:33.980> manipulate<00:02:34.490> the<00:02:34.850> images<00:02:35.240> more

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
that I can manipulate the images more

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.780 
that I can manipulate the images more
closely<00:02:35.900> to<00:02:36.260> where<00:02:36.410> I'm<00:02:36.530> at<00:02:36.680> I<00:02:36.920> like<00:02:37.490> to<00:02:37.640> know

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
closely to where I'm at I like to know

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.430 
closely to where I'm at I like to know
where<00:02:38.060> I<00:02:38.120> sampled<00:02:38.720> and<00:02:38.930> where<00:02:39.110> it's<00:02:39.230> going<00:02:39.350> to

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
where I sampled and where it's going to

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.530 
where I sampled and where it's going to
go<00:02:39.560> so<00:02:40.430> what<00:02:40.550> we<00:02:40.610> can<00:02:40.730> do<00:02:40.850> with<00:02:41.000> this<00:02:41.090> tool<00:02:41.330> is

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
go so what we can do with this tool is

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.130 
go so what we can do with this tool is
we<00:02:42.170> can<00:02:43.030> hold<00:02:44.030> down<00:02:44.180> order<00:02:44.510> option<00:02:44.660> and<00:02:45.050> get

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
we can hold down order option and get

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.140 
we can hold down order option and get
close<00:02:45.410> to<00:02:45.590> a<00:02:45.620> blemish<00:02:46.010> like<00:02:46.580> this<00:02:46.760> little<00:02:46.940> Mole

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
close to a blemish like this little Mole

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.940 
close to a blemish like this little Mole
here<00:02:47.420> and<00:02:47.720> get<00:02:47.900> close<00:02:48.140> to<00:02:48.290> it<00:02:48.319> and<00:02:48.500> hold<00:02:48.680> alt<00:02:48.890> or

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
here and get close to it and hold alt or

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.440 
here and get close to it and hold alt or
option<00:02:49.010> and<00:02:49.430> click<00:02:49.580> once<00:02:49.819> and<00:02:50.060> we've<00:02:50.270> now

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
option and click once and we've now

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.660 
option and click once and we've now
sampled<00:02:50.930> that<00:02:51.050> area<00:02:51.380> and<00:02:51.590> if<00:02:52.250> you<00:02:52.340> click<00:02:52.550> over

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
sampled that area and if you click over

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.540 
sampled that area and if you click over
top<00:02:52.970> of<00:02:53.000> the<00:02:53.569> blemish<00:02:53.870> it's<00:02:54.050> now<00:02:54.200> gone<00:02:54.550> we've

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
top of the blemish it's now gone we've

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.010 
top of the blemish it's now gone we've
sampled<00:02:55.790> an<00:02:56.000> area<00:02:56.209> that's<00:02:56.360> similar<00:02:56.569> and<00:02:56.930> it

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
sampled an area that's similar and it

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.050 
sampled an area that's similar and it
will<00:02:57.140> fade<00:02:57.410> in<00:02:57.620> to<00:02:58.130> the<00:02:58.280> other<00:02:58.400> end<00:02:58.670> part<00:02:59.030> of

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
will fade in to the other end part of

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.690 
will fade in to the other end part of
the<00:02:59.120> image<00:02:59.450> and<00:02:59.770> because<00:03:00.770> it<00:03:00.920> was<00:03:01.040> so<00:03:01.190> flawless

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
the image and because it was so flawless

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.400 
the image and because it was so flawless
it's<00:03:01.940> because<00:03:02.300> we<00:03:02.510> go<00:03:02.690> up<00:03:02.750> to<00:03:02.870> the<00:03:02.990> brush<00:03:03.170> tool

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
it's because we go up to the brush tool

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.260 
it's because we go up to the brush tool
and<00:03:04.130> we<00:03:04.220> make<00:03:04.370> sure<00:03:04.520> that<00:03:04.550> the<00:03:04.760> hardness<00:03:05.120> is

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
and we make sure that the hardness is

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.750 
and we make sure that the hardness is
set<00:03:05.450> to<00:03:05.570> zero<00:03:05.810> and<00:03:06.200> that<00:03:07.130> will<00:03:07.280> allow<00:03:07.460> it<00:03:07.520> to

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
set to zero and that will allow it to

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.589 
set to zero and that will allow it to
fade<00:03:07.970> into<00:03:08.300> the<00:03:08.570> other<00:03:08.690> parts<00:03:08.960> of<00:03:09.020> the

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
fade into the other parts of the

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:12.640 
fade into the other parts of the
let's<00:03:11.599> do<00:03:11.750> that<00:03:11.870> on<00:03:12.020> another<00:03:12.200> part<00:03:12.500> of<00:03:12.530> the

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
let's do that on another part of the

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.500 
let's do that on another part of the
image<00:03:12.860> let's<00:03:13.310> see<00:03:13.790> this<00:03:13.910> little<00:03:14.090> Mole<00:03:14.330> down

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
image let's see this little Mole down

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.080 
image let's see this little Mole down
here<00:03:14.810> and<00:03:14.989> let's<00:03:15.680> sample<00:03:15.920> right<00:03:16.160> next<00:03:16.970> to<00:03:17.060> it

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
here and let's sample right next to it

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.339 
here and let's sample right next to it
and<00:03:17.989> click<00:03:18.680> once<00:03:19.040> and<00:03:19.220> now<00:03:19.370> it's<00:03:19.459> going<00:03:20.349> the

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:30.349 
and this works kind of like the clone

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:33.160 
and this works kind of like the clone
tool<00:03:30.680> but<00:03:31.190> you<00:03:31.340> don't<00:03:31.489> have<00:03:31.610> to<00:03:31.730> sample<00:03:32.110> if<00:03:33.110> you

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
tool but you don't have to sample if you

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.199 
tool but you don't have to sample if you
just<00:03:33.650> find<00:03:33.920> an<00:03:34.069> area<00:03:34.340> like<00:03:34.550> this<00:03:34.580> blemish<00:03:34.940> up

click<00:03:37.400> once<00:03:37.430> on<00:03:38.090> top<00:03:38.239> of<00:03:38.390> it<00:03:38.510> it<00:03:39.110> samples

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
click once on top of it it samples

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.580 
click once on top of it it samples
around<00:03:39.950> that<00:03:40.220> part<00:03:40.519> and<00:03:40.700> blends<00:03:41.180> it<00:03:41.330> in<00:03:41.590> so

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
around that part and blends it in so

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.350 
around that part and blends it in so
that's<00:03:42.920> a<00:03:43.040> very<00:03:43.250> effective<00:03:43.790> tool<00:03:44.120> that<00:03:44.150> you

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
that's a very effective tool that you

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.580 
that's a very effective tool that you
can<00:03:44.420> use<00:03:44.480> but<00:03:44.780> sometimes<00:03:45.110> you<00:03:45.260> get<00:03:45.380> weird

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
can use but sometimes you get weird

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.550 
can use but sometimes you get weird
results<00:03:46.069> and<00:03:46.810> it<00:03:47.810> might<00:03:47.959> not<00:03:47.989> blend<00:03:48.410> as<00:03:48.530> well

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
results and it might not blend as well

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.160 
results and it might not blend as well
so<00:03:49.010> if<00:03:49.250> it<00:03:49.400> happens<00:03:49.970> that<00:03:50.269> way<00:03:50.390> just<00:03:50.690> click

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
so if it happens that way just click

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.229 
so if it happens that way just click
over<00:03:51.319> it<00:03:51.500> one<00:03:51.620> more<00:03:51.739> time<00:03:51.920> until<00:03:52.819> it<00:03:52.910> starts<00:03:53.180> to

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
over it one more time until it starts to

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.030 
over it one more time until it starts to
look<00:03:53.390> good<00:03:53.540> or<00:03:54.019> you<00:03:54.140> can<00:03:54.260> always<00:03:54.380> undo<00:03:54.590> and<00:03:54.950> try

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
look good or you can always undo and try

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.470 
look good or you can always undo and try
it<00:03:55.130> again

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
it again

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.610 
it again
so<00:03:56.480> let's<00:03:56.840> find<00:03:57.049> another<00:03:57.110> area<00:03:57.590> of

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
so let's find another area of

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.229 
so let's find another area of
imperfection<00:03:58.250> and<00:03:58.400> let's<00:03:58.640> try<00:03:58.819> this<00:03:58.880> tool

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
imperfection and let's try this tool

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.360 
imperfection and let's try this tool
I'll<00:04:00.140> zoom<00:04:00.410> in<00:04:00.530> a<00:04:00.590> little<00:04:00.680> bit<00:04:00.860> and<00:04:01.010> there's<00:04:01.310> a

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
I'll zoom in a little bit and there's a

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:02.559 
I'll zoom in a little bit and there's a
little<00:04:01.549> bit<00:04:01.670> of<00:04:01.760> freckles<00:04:02.090> over<00:04:02.269> here<00:04:02.450> and

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
little bit of freckles over here and

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:04.259 
little bit of freckles over here and
let's<00:04:02.690> try<00:04:02.930> that<00:04:03.049> again<00:04:03.110> just<00:04:03.470> click<00:04:03.590> once

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
let's try that again just click once

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:06.490 
let's try that again just click once
sample<00:04:05.269> is<00:04:05.329> the<00:04:05.390> rest<00:04:05.569> of<00:04:05.630> the<00:04:05.690> area<00:04:05.930> and<00:04:06.110> now

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
sample is the rest of the area and now

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.400 
sample is the rest of the area and now
it<00:04:06.769> looks<00:04:06.799> like<00:04:07.069> they<00:04:07.280> weren't<00:04:07.459> even<00:04:07.549> there

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
it looks like they weren't even there

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.860 
it looks like they weren't even there
we'll<00:04:09.410> try<00:04:09.620> this<00:04:09.680> area<00:04:10.130> right<00:04:10.280> here<00:04:10.750> on<00:04:11.750> the

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
we'll try this area right here on the

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.840 
we'll try this area right here on the
cheek<00:04:12.019> bone<00:04:12.230> slight<00:04:12.739> imperfection<00:04:13.280> click

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
cheek bone slight imperfection click

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.670 
cheek bone slight imperfection click
once<00:04:14.060> and<00:04:14.299> you<00:04:15.079> wouldn't<00:04:15.319> even<00:04:15.380> know<00:04:15.500> it<00:04:15.590> was

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
once and you wouldn't even know it was

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.020 
once and you wouldn't even know it was

is within the same tool set it's called

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:26.170 
is within the same tool set it's called
the<00:04:22.039> patch<00:04:22.250> tool<00:04:22.610> and<00:04:23.590> the<00:04:24.590> patch<00:04:24.800> tool<00:04:25.180> allows

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
the patch tool and the patch tool allows

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.000 
the patch tool and the patch tool allows
you<00:04:26.360> to<00:04:26.450> actually<00:04:26.539> draw<00:04:26.990> a<00:04:27.229> selection<00:04:27.289> and

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
you to actually draw a selection and

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.250 
you to actually draw a selection and
then<00:04:28.070> sample<00:04:29.030> another<00:04:29.330> part<00:04:29.630> of<00:04:29.690> the<00:04:29.750> image<00:04:29.960> to

in texture and color and let go and it

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.920 
in texture and color and let go and it
automatically<00:05:00.849> will<00:05:01.849> blend<00:05:02.150> those<00:05:02.389> areas

automatically will blend those areas

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.640 
automatically will blend those areas
together<00:05:03.740> by<00:05:04.370> taking<00:05:04.700> a<00:05:04.789> sample<00:05:05.180> so<00:05:06.050> if<00:05:06.470> we

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
together by taking a sample so if we

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.950 
together by taking a sample so if we
uncheck<00:05:07.160> the<00:05:07.849> top<00:05:08.060> layer<00:05:08.360> we<00:05:08.570> can<00:05:08.690> see<00:05:08.870> the

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
uncheck the top layer we can see the

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.620

that and we can click in and drag down
to<00:05:35.630> the<00:05:35.750> cheek<00:05:35.990> which<00:05:36.200> is<00:05:36.350> similar<00:05:36.650> in<00:05:36.740> texture

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.010 
to the cheek which is similar in texture

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:41.410 
to the cheek which is similar in texture
color<00:05:37.280> and<00:05:37.520> let<00:05:37.730> go<00:05:37.910> and<00:05:38.650> if<00:05:39.650> we<00:05:39.800> deselect<00:05:40.420> with

color and let go and if we deselect with
commander<00:05:41.840> control<00:05:41.990> D<00:05:42.260> we<00:05:42.650> can<00:05:42.800> see<00:05:42.980> that<00:05:43.130> now

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
commander control D we can see that now

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.010 
commander control D we can see that now
that's<00:05:43.640> blended<00:05:43.880> into<00:05:44.180> the<00:05:44.270> eye<00:05:44.300> and<00:05:44.690> we've

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 
that's blended into the eye and we've

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.130 
that's blended into the eye and we've
reduced<00:05:45.800> those<00:05:46.250> bags<00:05:46.580> and<00:05:46.820> the<00:05:46.940> eye<00:05:47.140> here's

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:48.140 
reduced those bags and the eye here's

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:53.410 
reduced those bags and the eye here's
before<00:05:48.520> here's<00:05:49.520> the<00:05:49.700> after<00:05:52.240> you<00:05:53.240> can

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:53.420 
before here's the after you can

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.610 
before here's the after you can
sometimes<00:05:53.840> use<00:05:54.020> this<00:05:54.140> to<00:05:54.290> get<00:05:54.440> rid<00:05:54.590> of

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
sometimes use this to get rid of

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:55.150 
sometimes use this to get rid of
wrinkles

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.160 
wrinkles

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.860 
wrinkles
so<00:05:55.550> if<00:05:55.640> we<00:05:55.730> go<00:05:55.850> down<00:05:55.880> here<00:05:56.030> to<00:05:56.270> the<00:05:56.510> bottom<00:05:56.660> of

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
so if we go down here to the bottom of

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.760 
so if we go down here to the bottom of
the<00:05:56.930> neck<00:05:57.080> and<00:05:58.060> highlight<00:05:59.060> and<00:05:59.240> drag<00:05:59.360> around

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
the neck and highlight and drag around

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.080 
the neck and highlight and drag around
and<00:06:00.770> we<00:06:00.950> find<00:06:01.220> an<00:06:01.310> area<00:06:01.460> that's<00:06:01.700> similar<00:06:01.910> in

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.090 
and we find an area that's similar in

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:03.730 
and we find an area that's similar in
color<00:06:02.270> maybe<00:06:02.540> this<00:06:03.110> part<00:06:03.290> of<00:06:03.350> the<00:06:03.410> cheek<00:06:03.560> and

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
color maybe this part of the cheek and

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.580 
color maybe this part of the cheek and
let<00:06:04.010> go<00:06:04.160> and<00:06:04.390> then<00:06:05.390> deselect<00:06:05.660> we<00:06:06.170> can<00:06:06.320> see<00:06:06.440> that

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:06.590 
let go and then deselect we can see that

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.190 
let go and then deselect we can see that
that's<00:06:06.770> now<00:06:06.950> gone<00:06:07.480> you<00:06:08.480> could<00:06:08.600> also<00:06:08.780> have<00:06:08.930> used

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:09.200 
that's now gone you could also have used

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.250 
that's now gone you could also have used
the<00:06:09.380> clone<00:06:09.620> tool<00:06:09.890> or<00:06:10.420> the<00:06:11.420> Healing<00:06:11.810> Brush<00:06:11.840> to

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:12.260 
the clone tool or the Healing Brush to

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.710 
the clone tool or the Healing Brush to
try<00:06:12.440> that<00:06:12.620> as<00:06:12.740> well<00:06:13.060> but<00:06:14.060> just<00:06:14.540> use<00:06:14.690> a

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:14.720 
try that as well but just use a

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.180 
try that as well but just use a
different<00:06:15.080> technique<00:06:15.350> if<00:06:15.650> you<00:06:15.830> don't<00:06:15.980> get<00:06:16.070> the

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.190 
different technique if you don't get the

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.980 
different technique if you don't get the
right<00:06:16.280> thing<00:06:16.490> you<00:06:16.580> need<00:06:16.730> just<00:06:17.450> use<00:06:17.660> one<00:06:17.900> of

details within and to do that what we
need<00:06:35.270> to<00:06:35.330> do<00:06:35.480> is<00:06:35.690> we<00:06:35.900> need<00:06:35.990> to<00:06:36.110> go<00:06:36.200> up<00:06:36.320> to<00:06:36.380> filter

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.020 
need to do is we need to go up to filter

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:45.970 
need to do is we need to go up to filter
blur<00:06:39.020> and<00:06:39.350> choose<00:06:41.320> surface<00:06:42.320> blur<00:06:44.980> surface

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:45.980 
blur and choose surface blur surface

blur will blur the surface of this image

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:50.380 
blur will blur the surface of this image
in<00:06:48.470> a<00:06:49.010> nice<00:06:49.190> way<00:06:49.430> that<00:06:49.700> will<00:06:49.820> allow<00:06:49.910> us<00:06:50.120> to<00:06:50.240> make

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:50.390 
in a nice way that will allow us to make

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:53.890 
in a nice way that will allow us to make
the<00:06:50.420> skin<00:06:50.750> look<00:06:51.370> very<00:06:52.370> smooth<00:06:52.700> you<00:06:52.970> have<00:06:53.750> two

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:53.900 
the skin look very smooth you have two

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.410 
the skin look very smooth you have two
options<00:06:54.290> the<00:06:54.410> radius<00:06:54.770> and<00:06:55.010> the<00:06:55.130> threshold<00:06:55.420> the

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:56.420 
options the radius and the threshold the

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:59.440 
options the radius and the threshold the
radius<00:06:57.010> basically<00:06:58.010> just<00:06:58.190> shows<00:06:58.460> you<00:06:58.640> how<00:06:58.850> much

00:06:59.440 --> 00:06:59.450 
radius basically just shows you how much

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:01.330 
radius basically just shows you how much
how<00:06:59.960> many<00:07:00.110> pixels<00:07:00.380> are<00:07:00.650> being<00:07:00.770> affected<00:07:01.220> by

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:01.340 
how many pixels are being affected by

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.790 
how many pixels are being affected by
this<00:07:01.400> tool<00:07:01.760> so<00:07:02.300> if<00:07:02.390> we<00:07:02.540> raise<00:07:02.660> it<00:07:02.870> thirty<00:07:03.650> eight

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:03.800 
this tool so if we raise it thirty eight

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.990 
this tool so if we raise it thirty eight
pixels<00:07:04.100> are<00:07:04.190> being<00:07:04.310> affected<00:07:04.670> and<00:07:04.820> really

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:05.000 
pixels are being affected and really

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.270 
pixels are being affected and really
smooth<00:07:05.270> and<00:07:05.600> then<00:07:06.320> we<00:07:06.440> have<00:07:06.590> the<00:07:06.740> threshold

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:07.280 
smooth and then we have the threshold

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.880 
smooth and then we have the threshold
which<00:07:08.270> lets<00:07:08.630> us<00:07:08.750> know<00:07:08.990> what<00:07:09.530> part<00:07:09.800> of<00:07:09.830> the

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:09.890 
which lets us know what part of the

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:11.830 
which lets us know what part of the
image<00:07:10.100> is<00:07:10.220> going<00:07:10.400> to<00:07:10.490> affect<00:07:10.850> so<00:07:11.510> if<00:07:11.600> we<00:07:11.690> drag

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:11.840 
image is going to affect so if we drag

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:12.850 
image is going to affect so if we drag
it<00:07:11.990> all<00:07:12.080> the<00:07:12.110> way<00:07:12.170> up<00:07:12.260> it's<00:07:12.470> going<00:07:12.620> to<00:07:12.680> affect

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:12.860 
it all the way up it's going to affect

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:15.190 
it all the way up it's going to affect
everything<00:07:13.130> and<00:07:13.520> it's<00:07:14.150> based<00:07:14.360> on<00:07:14.510> contrast<00:07:14.990> if

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:15.200 
everything and it's based on contrast if

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.290 
everything and it's based on contrast if
we<00:07:15.260> drag<00:07:15.470> it<00:07:15.620> all<00:07:15.710> the<00:07:15.740> way<00:07:15.800> down<00:07:16.300> nothing's

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:17.300 
we drag it all the way down nothing's

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.580 
we drag it all the way down nothing's
going<00:07:17.420> to<00:07:17.450> be<00:07:17.540> affected<00:07:17.960> so<00:07:17.990> it<00:07:18.320> looks<00:07:18.470> for

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:18.590 
going to be affected so it looks for

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:21.910 
going to be affected so it looks for
here's<00:07:18.830> a<00:07:18.860> contrast<00:07:19.370> and<00:07:20.650> that's<00:07:21.650> what

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:21.920 
here's a contrast and that's what

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.070 
here's a contrast and that's what
determines<00:07:22.040> where<00:07:22.850> the<00:07:22.880> radius<00:07:23.390> is<00:07:23.660> going<00:07:23.960> to

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.080 
determines where the radius is going to

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.140 
determines where the radius is going to
be<00:07:24.140> affected<00:07:24.500> so<00:07:24.850> generally<00:07:25.850> I<00:07:25.910> keep<00:07:26.060> these

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:26.150 
be affected so generally I keep these

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.210 
be affected so generally I keep these
pretty<00:07:26.360> low<00:07:26.540> I'll<00:07:27.200> take<00:07:27.410> the<00:07:27.530> radius<00:07:27.770> down<00:07:28.040> to

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:28.220 
pretty low I'll take the radius down to

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:31.780 
pretty low I'll take the radius down to
about<00:07:28.960> four<00:07:29.960> or<00:07:30.080> five<00:07:30.229> and<00:07:30.620> then<00:07:31.550> I'll<00:07:31.640> play

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:31.790 
about four or five and then I'll play

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:32.920 
about four or five and then I'll play
with<00:07:31.880> the<00:07:31.970> threshold<00:07:32.419> a<00:07:32.450> little<00:07:32.660> bit

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:32.930 
with the threshold a little bit

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:36.940 
with the threshold a little bit
start<00:07:33.350> out<00:07:33.470> low<00:07:35.110> and<00:07:36.110> start<00:07:36.470> to<00:07:36.560> bring<00:07:36.710> it<00:07:36.830> up

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:36.950 
start out low and start to bring it up

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:38.710 
start out low and start to bring it up
just<00:07:37.310> to<00:07:37.850> where<00:07:38.000> it<00:07:38.090> starts<00:07:38.330> to<00:07:38.390> smooth<00:07:38.630> out

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:38.720 
just to where it starts to smooth out

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.660 
just to where it starts to smooth out
that<00:07:38.900> skin<00:07:39.200> I<00:07:39.470> don't<00:07:39.920> want<00:07:40.070> it<00:07:40.130> to<00:07:40.220> look<00:07:40.370> too

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:40.670 
that skin I don't want it to look too

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:47.020 
that skin I don't want it to look too
fake<00:07:41.770> so<00:07:42.770> if<00:07:43.010> I<00:07:43.100> do<00:07:43.160> about<00:07:43.460> 4<00:07:43.910> in<00:07:44.410> 13<00:07:45.640> maybe<00:07:46.640> 15

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:47.030 
fake so if I do about 4 in 13 maybe 15

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:49.510 
fake so if I do about 4 in 13 maybe 15
let's<00:07:47.210> try<00:07:47.330> 15<00:07:47.720> we<00:07:48.620> now<00:07:48.770> can<00:07:49.010> see<00:07:49.220> that<00:07:49.400> that

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:49.520 
let's try 15 we now can see that that

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:50.860 
let's try 15 we now can see that that
image<00:07:49.700> is<00:07:49.940> starting<00:07:50.180> to<00:07:50.240> smooth<00:07:50.450> out<00:07:50.600> and<00:07:50.810> you

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:50.870 
image is starting to smooth out and you

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.270 
image is starting to smooth out and you
can<00:07:51.020> see<00:07:51.110> it<00:07:51.170> in<00:07:51.230> the<00:07:51.320> preview<00:07:51.500> too<00:07:51.830> so<00:07:52.100> if<00:07:52.190> you

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:52.280 
can see it in the preview too so if you

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.790 
can see it in the preview too so if you
click<00:07:52.400> and<00:07:52.580> drag
