00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:23.190 
there's something on the hill I do think

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:30.440 
there's something on the hill I do think
there's<00:00:23.520> a<00:00:23.640> Squatch<00:00:23.760> in<00:00:24.119> these<00:00:24.509> woods

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:30.450 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.930 

okay<00:00:31.170> here<00:00:31.350> we<00:00:31.440> go<00:00:31.470> we're<00:00:31.770> going<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:32.009> we<00:00:32.759> heard

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
okay here we go we're going to we heard

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.790 
okay here we go we're going to we heard
some<00:00:33.180> weird<00:00:33.450> noises<00:00:33.840> last<00:00:34.110> night<00:00:34.290> we're<00:00:34.680> going

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
some weird noises last night we're going

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.640 
some weird noises last night we're going
to<00:00:34.860> go<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.010> investigate<00:00:35.660> we've<00:00:36.660> heard<00:00:37.440> some

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650 
to go to investigate we've heard some

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.299 
to go to investigate we've heard some
howls<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.880> some<00:00:39.059> knock<00:00:39.780> some<00:00:40.140> trees<00:00:40.280> so<00:00:41.280> we

howls and some knock some trees so we

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
think it may be a sure sign of Sasquatch

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.820 
think it may be a sure sign of Sasquatch
so<00:00:45.570> definitely<00:00:45.989> Sasquatch
