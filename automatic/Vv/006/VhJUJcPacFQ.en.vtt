like it's more i almost said more better
which<00:03:31.940> is<00:03:31.970> not<00:03:32.540> correct<00:03:32.959> i<00:03:33.290> feel<00:03:33.650> like<00:03:33.680> it

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:33.949 
which is not correct i feel like it

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:35.229 
which is not correct i feel like it
makes<00:03:34.069> more<00:03:34.310> sense<00:03:34.370> from<00:03:34.879> a<00:03:35.030> business

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
makes more sense from a business

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.030 
makes more sense from a business
standpoint<00:03:35.629> to<00:03:36.109> say<00:03:36.290> okay<00:03:36.620> we're<00:03:36.799> going<00:03:36.919> to
