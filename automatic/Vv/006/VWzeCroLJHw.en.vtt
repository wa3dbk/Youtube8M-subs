00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
i'm jason with pierre talk and these are

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:13.759 
i'm jason with pierre talk and these are
gear<00:00:04.020> pods<00:00:11.179> pure<00:00:12.179> pods<00:00:12.420> is<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:12.750> modular<00:00:13.410> gear

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
gear pods pure pods is a modular gear

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.359 
gear pods pure pods is a modular gear
system<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.460> it<00:00:15.210> consists<00:00:15.660> of<00:00:15.870> these<00:00:16.470> small

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
system and it consists of these small

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.450 
system and it consists of these small
pods<00:00:18.090> that<00:00:18.810> each<00:00:18.990> contain<00:00:19.439> different<00:00:19.740> types

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
pods that each contain different types

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.490 
pods that each contain different types
of<00:00:20.609> gear<00:00:20.820> so<00:00:21.029> for<00:00:21.180> example<00:00:21.240> this<00:00:21.990> one<00:00:22.230> has<00:00:22.470> a

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
of gear so for example this one has a

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.560 
of gear so for example this one has a
fire<00:00:22.800> symbol<00:00:23.250> on<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.340> so<00:00:23.609> that's<00:00:23.789> fire

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
fire symbol on it so that's fire

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.500 
fire symbol on it so that's fire
starting<00:00:25.019> stuff<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.769> survival<00:00:26.369> things<00:00:26.580> this

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
starting stuff and survival things this

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.929 
starting stuff and survival things this
one<00:00:27.750> has<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.320> little<00:00:28.439> shelter<00:00:28.949> symbol<00:00:29.429> on<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.550> so

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
one has a little shelter symbol on it so

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.260 
one has a little shelter symbol on it so
that's<00:00:30.630> your<00:00:30.810> shelter<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.830> this<00:00:32.640> one<00:00:32.850> has<00:00:33.239> the

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
that's your shelter and this one has the

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.440 
that's your shelter and this one has the
cooking<00:00:33.870> icon<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:34.829> that's<00:00:35.309> your<00:00:35.430> emergency<00:00:36.120> or

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
cooking icon so that's your emergency or

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.819 
cooking icon so that's your emergency or
survival<00:00:36.989> cooking<00:00:37.380> gear<00:00:39.410> the<00:00:40.410> idea<00:00:40.649> is<00:00:40.710> that

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
survival cooking gear the idea is that

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.310 
survival cooking gear the idea is that
you<00:00:41.160> can<00:00:41.399> put<00:00:41.730> together<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:42.120> customized<00:00:42.809> gear

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
you can put together a customized gear

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.500 
you can put together a customized gear
kit<00:00:43.559> by<00:00:44.010> putting<00:00:44.520> different<00:00:44.700> pods<00:00:45.120> together

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
kit by putting different pods together

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.139 
kit by putting different pods together
so<00:00:45.840> they<00:00:46.530> come<00:00:46.770> with<00:00:46.980> end<00:00:47.219> caps<00:00:47.520> like<00:00:47.730> this<00:00:47.940> but

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
so they come with end caps like this but

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.910 
so they come with end caps like this but
you<00:00:48.270> can<00:00:48.300> also<00:00:48.539> attach<00:00:48.960> them<00:00:49.230> together<00:00:49.379> with

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
you can also attach them together with

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.270 
you can also attach them together with
some<00:00:50.640> additional<00:00:50.879> caps<00:00:51.329> like<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.280> form

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
some additional caps like this and form

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.910 
some additional caps like this and form
a<00:00:53.399> stack<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.030> really<00:00:54.930> just<00:00:55.050> customize<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.739> and

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
a stack and really just customize it and

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.220 
a stack and really just customize it and
only<00:00:56.070> bring<00:00:56.340> whatever<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.760> really<00:00:57.360> need<00:00:57.539> so

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
only bring whatever you really need so

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.099 
only bring whatever you really need so
you<00:00:58.649> can<00:00:59.309> do<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.579> with<00:00:59.760> cap<00:01:00.329> like<00:01:00.539> this<00:01:00.780> that's

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
you can do it with cap like this that's

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.689 
you can do it with cap like this that's
solid<00:01:01.559> if<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:01.859> want<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.070> keep<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.250> contents

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
solid if you want to keep the contents

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.420 
solid if you want to keep the contents
separated<00:01:03.449> or<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:04.049> can<00:01:04.229> make<00:01:04.379> one<00:01:04.559> big<00:01:04.830> long

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
separated or you can make one big long

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
myself on knowing most of the designs

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.259 
myself on knowing most of the designs
that<00:03:14.680> are<00:03:14.769> out<00:03:14.920> there<00:03:14.950> but<00:03:15.400> like<00:03:15.850> I<00:03:15.940> said<00:03:16.000> this

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
that are out there but like I said this

that are out there but like I said this
one<00:03:16.480> really<00:03:16.690> threw<00:03:16.989> me<00:03:17.049> for<00:03:17.170> a<00:03:17.350> loop<00:03:17.380> so<00:03:17.769> let's

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
one really threw me for a loop so let's

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.810 
one really threw me for a loop so let's
go<00:03:18.280> see<00:03:18.459> how<00:03:18.549> the<00:03:18.609> stove<00:03:18.880> performs<00:03:20.820> here's

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
go see how the stove performs here's

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:28.140 
go see how the stove performs here's
what<00:03:22.060> the<00:03:22.180> flame<00:03:22.600> pattern<00:03:22.810> looks<00:03:23.200> like

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:34.679 

and<00:03:28.980> there's<00:03:29.980> our<00:03:30.159> boil<00:03:30.579> at<00:03:31.650> about<00:03:33.689> six

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:34.689 
and there's our boil at about six

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:37.199 
and there's our boil at about six
minutes<00:03:34.930> and<00:03:35.230> 11<00:03:35.500> seconds<00:03:35.920> little<00:03:36.640> slow<00:03:36.939> but

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
minutes and 11 seconds little slow but

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.899 
minutes and 11 seconds little slow but
again<00:03:38.200> this<00:03:38.470> is<00:03:38.530> for<00:03:38.890> emergency<00:03:39.430> use<00:03:39.459> or

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:39.909 
again this is for emergency use or

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:44.750 
again this is for emergency use or
survival<00:03:40.360> situations<00:03:40.930> so<00:03:41.200> not<00:03:41.920> too<00:03:42.159> bad<00:03:43.260> in

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
survival situations so not too bad in

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.849 
survival situations so not too bad in
addition<00:03:45.760> to<00:03:46.209> the<00:03:46.359> cooking<00:03:46.840> pod<00:03:47.049> I<00:03:47.290> also<00:03:47.530> got

the<00:03:48.069> shelter<00:03:48.400> pod<00:03:48.579> so<00:03:49.510> let's<00:03:49.659> just<00:03:49.750> open<00:03:50.200> this

00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:50.439 
the shelter pod so let's just open this

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090 
slings that they're carrying and want to

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:51.580 
slings that they're carrying and want to
you<00:05:50.480> know<00:05:50.600> customize<00:05:51.050> the<00:05:51.260> different

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590 
you know customize the different

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.270 
you know customize the different
situations<00:05:52.490> but<00:05:52.700> anyway<00:05:52.970> a<00:05:53.000> really<00:05:53.420> cool<00:05:53.660> idea

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
situations but anyway a really cool idea

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.230 
situations but anyway a really cool idea
they've<00:05:55.280> definitely<00:05:55.550> paid<00:05:55.880> a<00:05:55.910> lot<00:05:56.120> of

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
they've definitely paid a lot of

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.910 
they've definitely paid a lot of
attention<00:05:56.660> to<00:05:56.690> detail<00:05:56.810> when<00:05:57.620> they<00:05:57.710> came<00:05:57.860> up

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:57.920 
attention to detail when they came up

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.910 
attention to detail when they came up
with<00:05:58.160> this<00:05:58.250> system<00:05:59.590> I've<00:06:00.590> been<00:06:00.740> thinking

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:00.920 
with this system I've been thinking

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.640 
with this system I've been thinking
about<00:06:01.420> applications<00:06:02.420> of<00:06:02.690> the<00:06:03.080> gear<00:06:03.440> pod

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.650 
about applications of the gear pod

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.710 
about applications of the gear pod
system<00:06:03.980> and<00:06:04.370> what<00:06:04.910> I've<00:06:05.000> concluded<00:06:05.330> is<00:06:05.690> that

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:05.720 
system and what I've concluded is that

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.570 
system and what I've concluded is that
it's<00:06:06.170> not<00:06:06.230> really<00:06:06.680> for<00:06:06.980> ultralight

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580 
it's not really for ultralight

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.420 
it's not really for ultralight
backpackers<00:06:08.240> that<00:06:08.690> is<00:06:08.840> the<00:06:09.140> whole<00:06:09.290> system<00:06:09.560> no

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.430 
backpackers that is the whole system no

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.580 
backpackers that is the whole system no
one<00:06:10.580> would<00:06:10.730> put<00:06:11.540> this<00:06:11.690> thing<00:06:11.930> in<00:06:11.990> a<00:06:12.260> you<00:06:12.500> know

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590 
one would put this thing in a you know

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.410 
one would put this thing in a you know
ultralight<00:06:13.190> backpacking<00:06:13.220> and<00:06:13.820> telling<00:06:14.330> it

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:14.420 
ultralight backpacking and telling it

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.930 
ultralight backpacking and telling it
around<00:06:14.860> however<00:06:15.860> the<00:06:16.160> components<00:06:16.700> that<00:06:16.820> they

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:16.940 
around however the components that they

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.120 
around however the components that they
sell<00:06:17.350> individually<00:06:18.350> are<00:06:18.560> for<00:06:18.950> you<00:06:19.010> l

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.130 
sell individually are for you l

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:20.590 
sell individually are for you l
backpackers<00:06:19.700> and<00:06:19.730> if<00:06:19.940> you<00:06:20.030> go<00:06:20.120> to<00:06:20.180> their<00:06:20.360> site

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:20.600 
backpackers and if you go to their site

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.330 
backpackers and if you go to their site
they<00:06:21.170> have<00:06:21.290> a<00:06:21.320> lot<00:06:21.530> more<00:06:21.710> stuff<00:06:21.980> that<00:06:22.220> I<00:06:22.250> don't

they have a lot more stuff that I don't

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.250 
they have a lot more stuff that I don't
even<00:06:22.610> talk<00:06:23.060> about<00:06:23.120> today<00:06:23.690> just<00:06:23.870> because<00:06:23.930> they

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:24.260 
even talk about today just because they

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.050 
even talk about today just because they

have so much that I think you all

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.570 
have so much that I think you all
backpackers<00:06:26.630> would<00:06:26.840> love<00:06:27.070> the<00:06:28.070> application

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:28.580 
backpackers would love the application

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.390 
backpackers would love the application
for<00:06:28.790> the<00:06:28.850> whole<00:06:29.000> system<00:06:29.360> I<00:06:29.810> see<00:06:30.410> as<00:06:30.710> many<00:06:31.070> fold

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:31.400 
for the whole system I see as many fold

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.340 
for the whole system I see as many fold
I<00:06:31.610> would<00:06:32.360> like<00:06:32.450> to<00:06:32.600> leave<00:06:32.690> one<00:06:32.870> of<00:06:32.960> these<00:06:33.050> in<00:06:33.230> my

of<00:06:54.710> applications<00:06:55.070> think<00:06:55.910> 80<00:06:56.150> beers<00:06:56.660> might

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:56.930 
of applications think 80 beers might

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.160 
of applications think 80 beers might
want<00:06:57.140> to<00:06:57.550> have<00:06:58.550> one<00:06:58.700> of<00:06:58.760> these<00:06:58.850> on<00:06:59.270> their<00:06:59.630> ATV

to have this whole sling right here you

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.330 
to have this whole sling right here you
could<00:07:05.420> probably<00:07:05.600> survive<00:07:05.870> just<00:07:06.470> with<00:07:06.620> this<00:07:06.830> it

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:07.340 
could probably survive just with this it

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:08.740 
could probably survive just with this it
carries<00:07:07.700> basically<00:07:08.090> everything<00:07:08.360> you<00:07:08.450> need<00:07:08.600> if

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:14.030 
so I love the modular design I don't see

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:15.970 
so I love the modular design I don't see
the<00:07:14.060> system<00:07:14.390> working<00:07:14.750> for<00:07:15.140> you<00:07:15.260> l<00:07:15.380> backpackers
