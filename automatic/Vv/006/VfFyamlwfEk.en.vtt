00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
a log or a try but I couldn't really

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.420 
a log or a try but I couldn't really
maintain<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.480> temperature<00:00:49.020> on<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:50.250> was

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.749 

and<00:01:17.270> it's<00:01:18.270> actually<00:01:18.979> it<00:01:19.979> was<00:01:20.130> brewed<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.520> little

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
and it's actually it was brewed a little

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.399 
and it's actually it was brewed a little
bit<00:01:20.939> warm<00:01:21.240> i'll<00:01:21.540> tell<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:21.750> how<00:01:21.900> i<00:01:21.930> brewed<00:01:22.259> it

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
bit warm i'll tell you how i brewed it

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.950 
bit warm i'll tell you how i brewed it
i'll<00:01:22.530> put<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.830> recipe<00:01:23.340> up<00:01:23.460> as<00:01:23.670> well<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.630> this

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
i'll put the recipe up as well so this

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.320 
i'll put the recipe up as well so this
was<00:01:25.170> just<00:01:25.200> your<00:01:25.560> Cooper's<00:01:26.189> European<00:01:26.729> market

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
was just your Cooper's European market

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.870 
was just your Cooper's European market
and<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:28.439> standard<00:01:28.890> way<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.070> usually<00:01:29.400> make<00:01:29.549> beer

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
and the standard way I usually make beer

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.749 
and the standard way I usually make beer
two<00:01:30.750> pounds<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.320> light<00:01:31.619> malt<00:01:31.890> extract<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.700> a

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
two pounds of light malt extract and a

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.319 
two pounds of light malt extract and a
pound<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.240> half<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.630> high<00:01:33.900> Mach<00:01:34.110> lukose<00:01:34.560> and

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
pound and a half of high Mach lukose and

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:38.240 
pound and a half of high Mach lukose and
this<00:01:36.329> is<00:01:36.509> what<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.689> produced<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.409> typical

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
this is what it produced a typical

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.910 
this is what it produced a typical
longer<00:01:38.670> very<00:01:38.970> small<00:01:39.840> head<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.350> doesn't<00:01:40.530> last

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
longer very small head it doesn't last

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.030 
longer very small head it doesn't last
all<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.640> long<00:01:41.810> but<00:01:42.810> it's<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.560> good<00:01:43.710> taste<00:01:43.920> of

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
all that long but it's a good taste of

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.469 
all that long but it's a good taste of
beer<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.399> actually<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:45.090> way<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.210> like<00:01:45.450> to

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
beer and actually the way I like to

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.819 
beer and actually the way I like to
describe<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.799> tastes<00:01:47.280> kind<00:01:47.579> of<00:01:47.700> like<00:01:47.759> a

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
describe it it tastes kind of like a

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:54.770 
describe it it tastes kind of like a
Heineken<00:01:49.829> without<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.280> stinky<00:01:50.700> taste<00:01:53.659> and<00:01:54.659> it

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
Heineken without the stinky taste and it

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.999 
Heineken without the stinky taste and it
doesn't<00:01:55.170> quite<00:01:55.439> have<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:55.770> up<00:01:56.420> the<00:01:57.420> crisp

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
doesn't quite have that up the crisp

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.620 
doesn't quite have that up the crisp
lager<00:01:59.009> taste<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.610> that's<00:02:00.060> just<00:02:00.270> because<00:02:00.420> it

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
lager taste and that's just because it

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.270 
lager taste and that's just because it
was<00:02:00.659> brewed<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.380> little<00:02:01.649> bit<00:02:01.799> ly<00:02:01.950> but<00:02:02.159> it's

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
was brewed a little bit ly but it's

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.310 
was brewed a little bit ly but it's
still<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.520> delicious<00:02:03.060> beer<00:02:03.329> it's<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:04.110> noise

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
still a delicious beer it's a noise

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.289 
still a delicious beer it's a noise
light<00:02:04.649> lager<00:02:04.950> it's<00:02:05.369> probably<00:02:05.790> not<00:02:06.030> something

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
light lager it's probably not something

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.419 
light lager it's probably not something
I'll<00:02:06.810> make<00:02:07.140> again<00:02:07.469> it's<00:02:07.710> pretty<00:02:08.009> good<00:02:08.160> beer

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429
