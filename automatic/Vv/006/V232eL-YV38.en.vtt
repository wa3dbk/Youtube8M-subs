00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:53.380 
original schedule which is often

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.050 
original schedule which is often
difficult<00:00:53.590> with<00:00:54.010> a<00:00:54.040> hardware<00:00:54.310> project<00:00:54.880> like

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:55.060 
difficult with a hardware project like

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.800 
difficult with a hardware project like
this<00:00:55.270> so<00:00:56.110> here<00:00:56.320> we<00:00:56.410> go<00:00:56.530> this<00:00:56.770> is<00:00:56.800> the<00:00:57.810> pluggable

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:58.810 
this so here we go this is the pluggable
