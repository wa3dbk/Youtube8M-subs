00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
about that we've gotten a great response

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.010 
about that we've gotten a great response
of<00:01:11.070> them<00:01:11.189> from<00:01:11.640> them<00:01:11.790> this<00:01:11.909> year<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:12.900> we're

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
of them from them this year so so we're

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.660 
of them from them this year so so we're
gonna<00:01:13.080> continue<00:01:13.470> moving<00:01:13.860> forward<00:01:14.310> with<00:01:14.430> those

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
gonna continue moving forward with those

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.570 
gonna continue moving forward with those
and<00:01:15.320> we<00:01:16.320> find<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.680> X's<00:01:17.009> in<00:01:17.040> general<00:01:17.460> are

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
and we find the X's in general are

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.070 
and we find the X's in general are
really<00:01:17.610> bridging<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.299> gap<00:01:18.479> between<00:01:18.509> ass

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
really bridging the gap between ass

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.260 
really bridging the gap between ass
active<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.740> passive<00:01:19.890> pickups<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:20.700> if<00:01:21.150> you've

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270
