00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.890
 and nowhere in the development of the 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.930
 shipping the briefing what we created 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.640
 have based on the feedback of our 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.590
 testplayers in many 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.090
 training sessions consider whether heart and 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.859
 have tested kidney based on this 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.140
 We then have the briefings 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.340
 developed in cooperation with ours 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:38.150
 Developers are particularly beautiful 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.610
 the shape structure of the rapid here 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:44.100
 mhd light microscope extraordinary 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.590
 large pores that are measured microscopically 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.600
 can and can evaluate 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.820
 we have many larger spaces 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.820
 swim with others 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.900
 Rapid mix consists of over 15 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.210
 components are the main ingredient 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.730
 Natural rubber from controlled cultivation 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.490
 everything from a selected plantation 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.680
 we start with a reactive ago 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.500
 Mix it here on the roller 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.750
 is opened first time the mix 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.040
 tree on the roller must next 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.590
 we color here too 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.800
 the chemicals are now mixed 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.110
 whether the mix will make that reactive 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.930
 run two chemical reactions 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.430
 Synchronous the networking reaction and 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.229
 the third-party reaction 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:36.509
 The latter is such a kind of baking powder 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:38.820
 later in vulcanization process for the 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.680
 Curves ensures these chemicals will be 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.110
 on roller thoroughly one after the other 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.690
 mixed in and distributed at the end of the 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.490
 Mixture provided so-called fabric countries 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.930
 for a thorough left right 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.930
 distribution of all components 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.290
 at the conception of a 90 of the plaque 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.880
 is of course to note that the two 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.480
 components have to play together 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.850
 have to 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.520
 this is the one to the other already 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.320
 but still 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.880
 and if a coating works well 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.560
 should then these two 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.710
 be compatible with each other 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.270
 that's something we at the beginning of 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.670
 to have to do 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:33.070
 already includes the basic design 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.930
 both components in the development 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.660
 the water has seen us too 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.650
 this particular swing also 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.040
 make changes to don gummer 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.280
 have to 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.660
 that is, here was another 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.990
 Mixture for the Obergoms uses the 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.910
 was reintroduced and with this 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.280
 interplay of the new mix and the 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.920
 new sponge we could do a lot 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.770
 generate good resonance of the coating around 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.150
 so that the maximum spin what the 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.240
 to get it out 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.570
 Here we see a simulation of the 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:08.160
 Influence of his balles with rotation in 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:11.980
 a covering and you can do very well here 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.200
 recognize that the ball is being slowed down 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.570
 the energy is the integration in it 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.110
 is stored in bella and with the 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:23.080
 ball is given back optimally 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.060
 So here's this spin reversal 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.470
 have the lining and thus the spin 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.470
 maximize effect 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.400
 However, we have some analogies to 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:39.250
 formula 1 as well as there the tire optimally 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.830
 can also stick to the street 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.140
 here the plaque only work if 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:48.190
 the friction of the efficient between 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:50.950
 ball and flooring is optimal and that too 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.420
 was the aim of this new development to 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.270
 really leave an optimal here 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.220
 system has reached the formula we 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.870
 has found us for the rapid 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.450
 now also a lot of potential 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.100
 shown what we vote for others 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:10.209
 can do so that we can say 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:12.040
 we are rapidly developing 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.620
 others are of the firm view that it 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.870
 not the perfect covering there but 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.030
 only the individually suitable covering for 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.680
 every special player types 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.810
 development of on rohrer was definitely 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.750
 very time consuming and has a lot of power 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:29.070
 tasted but like the result in the end 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.070
 showed it was worth it
