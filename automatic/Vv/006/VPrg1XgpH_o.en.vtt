00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 Hi, how are you, David Vlogs? 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.480
 today my friends, I bring you a 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.580
 new recent video like the bread that 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.620
 he leaves his bakery around the corner on 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.769
 today we are going to talk about fifa 16 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.740
 but a little more focused on Mexico to the 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.260
 liga bancomer mx than through its 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.960
 twitter account and facebook the 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.029
 esports and league account 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.269
 bancomer mx itself announced that it was going to 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.949
 have new news for the people of 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:31.679
 mexico the people who liked the 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.690
 liga bancomer mx and that I was going to see 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.030
 changes and the whole roll made a 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.860
 countdown and they painted it as 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.660
 shocking news and all the roll and 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.840
 the truth I was excited I said 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.399
 maybe they are stadiums with more licenses 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.800
 as the omnilife that really 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.480
 dislike the name and the stadium well 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.070
 built in the game or the new one that 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.199
 they made the striped that is 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.899
 pretty good I think it's called the bbv 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.850
 I 'm not very sure I think so but 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.039
 It's pretty good and I think it's no longer 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.960
 nothing is missing to be released and 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.500
 would be great to put him there I 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.360
 I thought maybe they announced better build 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.140
 in the face of the players thing that 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.510
 comment 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.860
 digital past time maybe they will improve 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.190
 the face of all the players of 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.440
 mexico to the best I said maybe to the 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.729
 better the league of promotion to the best that 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.050
 is the great news that you want to give and 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.350
 sporting the league bancomer to the best 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:28.950
 goal in the league of ascent and ascent mx 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.470
 on fifa 16 maybe possibly maybe 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.050
 that he announced that they finally have 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.470
 concachampions license and then everything 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:40.080
 that roll or leagues more removed cup mx or 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.840
 whatever it may be or already flat out I said 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.509
 well already in the very given case I know that 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.390
 konami and pro evolution about you have the 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.479
 licenses of the narration of Martinoli 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.360
 luís garcía directed the best in one of 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.130
 those unlikely was the lowest that the 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.300
 they got to them because the truth told me 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.220
 I would love a game with them from 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.810
 storytellers instead of those who have 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.270
 right now they are fernando pigeon and cough 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.300
 but obviously I prefer those of them 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.250
 they ask that the television ones that's a lot 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.679
 more obvious but I was anxious watching 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.989
 the conference or listening to it because the 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.830
 stupid transmission of the conference 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.350
 he does not wear 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.540
 It fell down I said well then let's see 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.090
 which of which I am thinking is the 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.890
 great news bomb and well really not 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.170
 has nothing spectacular and does not have 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.570
 nothing to do with the game of fifa itself 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.810
 the only thing that is giving you and sports 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.210
 and fifa good yes and fifa and the league is that 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.820
 you who are hearing this are going to 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.410
 decide or you will be able to choose the player 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.960
 that will come out on the cover of the game 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.300
 that's the only thing that's going to happen 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.550
 curious but possibly you were 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.440
 thinking good they 're going to put this to 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.090
 'chicharito' month and is from sodium box 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.010
 it's going to be month and shared with another 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.840
 but you could have thought 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.600
 good does the 'chicharito' or carlos vela 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:58.470
 but they did not give eight people eight 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.810
 players that play in Mexico that do not 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.830
 they are abroad and they are going to 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.420
 appear on the cover 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.090
 here I am leaving players 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.520
 that are of moises muñoz of the america the 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.350
 goalkeeper and is eduardo herrera de pumas 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.730
 the giménez chaco that although it is not 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.560
 Mexican since it is practically 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.780
 adopted with Mexican that with the cross 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.209
 blue is frame fabian of chivas 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.400
 hugo ayala de tigres hiram mier de 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.640
 striped diego debuen de pachuca 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.220
 good since the and the gold chop 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.680
 of saints those are the eight players 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.659
 offered by the bancomer league so that 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.390
 you can choose one of them so that 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:35.340
 share cover with lionel messi in the 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.489
 fifa 16 that is going to be obviously for 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.349
 Mexico a few hours ago they launched the 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:42.659
 Well how would you say voting through 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:45.269
 a conference and they released them all 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:46.620
 them and you through a page that yes 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.170
 I'll leave you in the description 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.349
 You can go vote for the player that you 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:56.370
 prefer in the truth being sincere I 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:58.250
 then I would vote for moisés muñoz I want 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.220
 think 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.600
 moises muñoz or go to mier grape and tea 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.610
 same in defense but we will not discuss 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.520
 of football they asked the account of 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.560
 esports why not chicharito or not 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.470
 carlos candle and said that people 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.900
 demanded new new faces in the 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.450
 covers and then I started thinking 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.519
 why not why not think about yuri 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.140
 fasting is a great player because it does not 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.060
 think of the hector herrera who is a 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.770
 great player I think the best 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.620
 half Mexican who is right now in the 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.660
 alien great player because not 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.610
 think about him a lot to why not think 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.110
 in players who play in the 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.490
 foreign but that is not very common 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.580
 see them on the cover 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.860
 I thought I suggested truth so you what 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.010
 Do you think that one of them deserves 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:45.290
 be recorded on the cover of fifa and 6 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.450
 what do you think you care that one of 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.340
 they come out you think someone else that 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:51.890
 milita in the Mexican league deserved a 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.540
 place of lost as a candidate do you think 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.160
 that it is unfair that they have not thought about 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.410
 players who are abroad that 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.180
 they take time without appearing all 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.220
