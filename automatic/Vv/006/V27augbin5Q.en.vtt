00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.550 

I<00:00:15.100> had<00:00:16.059> been<00:00:16.480> given<00:00:16.750> the<00:00:16.810> opportunity<00:00:17.320> to<00:00:17.350> work

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:17.560 
I had been given the opportunity to work

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.370 
I had been given the opportunity to work
in<00:00:17.740> a<00:00:17.830> large<00:00:18.250> manufacturing<00:00:19.000> company<00:00:19.390> with

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:20.380 
in a large manufacturing company with

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.770 
in a large manufacturing company with
with<00:00:20.650> plants<00:00:21.250> all<00:00:21.760> around<00:00:21.910> the<00:00:22.119> country<00:00:22.300> and

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:22.780 
with plants all around the country and

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.200 
with plants all around the country and
so<00:00:23.410> I<00:00:23.470> was<00:00:23.740> able<00:00:23.890> to<00:00:24.070> really<00:00:24.340> begin<00:00:24.580> to<00:00:24.730> test<00:00:25.090> a

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
so I was able to really begin to test a

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.150 
so I was able to really begin to test a
lot<00:00:25.360> of<00:00:25.480> the<00:00:25.540> methodologies<00:00:26.260> that<00:00:26.529> I<00:00:26.890> felt

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
lot of the methodologies that I felt

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.990 
lot of the methodologies that I felt
would<00:00:27.250> be<00:00:27.310> laid<00:00:27.610> on<00:00:27.640> my<00:00:27.820> heart<00:00:27.850> by<00:00:28.300> God<00:00:28.510> and<00:00:29.260> in

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
would be laid on my heart by God and in

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.180 
would be laid on my heart by God and in
terms<00:00:31.000> of<00:00:31.150> trying<00:00:31.390> to<00:00:31.420> help<00:00:31.570> a<00:00:31.869> culture<00:00:32.590> in<00:00:33.010> an

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 
terms of trying to help a culture in an

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.549 
terms of trying to help a culture in an
organization<00:00:33.820> actually<00:00:34.059> change<00:00:34.690> to<00:00:35.410> become

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
organization actually change to become

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:37.740 
organization actually change to become
better<00:00:35.890> and<00:00:36.220> not<00:00:37.030> just<00:00:37.180> the<00:00:37.300> better<00:00:37.420> I<00:00:37.540> should

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
better and not just the better I should

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.119 
better and not just the better I should
say<00:00:37.870> to<00:00:38.050> become<00:00:38.290> the<00:00:38.410> best<00:00:38.620> that<00:00:38.710> it<00:00:38.830> could<00:00:38.949> be

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:39.129 
say to become the best that it could be

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:41.790 
say to become the best that it could be
so<00:00:39.910> I<00:00:39.940> had<00:00:40.120> these<00:00:40.300> methodologies<00:00:40.720> that<00:00:41.260> for

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
so I had these methodologies that for

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.380 
so I had these methodologies that for
about<00:00:41.890> five<00:00:42.220> year<00:00:42.489> period<00:00:42.730> I<00:00:42.970> was<00:00:43.090> able<00:00:43.360> to

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
about five year period I was able to

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.590 
about five year period I was able to
actually<00:00:43.570> test<00:00:44.170> in<00:00:44.890> a<00:00:45.100> large<00:00:45.790> organization

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
actually test in a large organization

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.970 
actually test in a large organization
setting<00:00:47.320> the<00:00:47.409> large<00:00:47.620> organization<00:00:48.309> and

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
setting the large organization and

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.500 
setting the large organization and

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
that just really struggled with and

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
and actually kind of culminated with I

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.690 
and actually kind of culminated with I
lost<00:02:33.569> a<00:02:33.720> whole<00:02:33.870> day<00:02:33.930> of<00:02:34.080> stuff<00:02:34.440> on<00:02:34.650> my<00:02:34.770> on<00:02:35.640> my

my heart you know from that point on the
next<00:03:20.980> ten<00:03:21.189> weeks<00:03:21.459> really<00:03:22.200> it<00:03:23.200> was<00:03:23.379> as<00:03:23.500> fast<00:03:23.739> as

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:23.889 
next ten weeks really it was as fast as

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:25.500

methodologies<00:03:43.930> that<00:03:44.049> I<00:03:44.109> had<00:03:44.319> laid<00:03:44.560> out<00:03:44.590> there

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:45.159 
methodologies that I had laid out there

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:47.339 
methodologies that I had laid out there
was<00:03:45.280> all<00:03:45.549> these<00:03:45.669> steps<00:03:46.000> that<00:03:46.180> I<00:03:46.329> thought<00:03:46.629> you

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
was all these steps that I thought you

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.309 
was all these steps that I thought you
know<00:03:47.439> I<00:03:47.469> was<00:03:47.590> going<00:03:47.680> to<00:03:47.769> be<00:03:47.859> writing<00:03:48.219> about<00:03:48.280> to

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
know I was going to be writing about to

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.149 
know I was going to be writing about to
transform<00:03:50.319> the<00:03:50.530> culture<00:03:50.919> of<00:03:50.949> an<00:03:51.099> organization

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:51.159 
transform the culture of an organization

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:54.509 
transform the culture of an organization
or<00:03:51.909> a<00:03:51.970> team<00:03:52.209> and<00:03:52.659> it<00:03:53.620> ended<00:03:53.829> up<00:03:53.919> being<00:03:54.129> just<00:03:54.430> the

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
or a team and it ended up being just the

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.580 
or a team and it ended up being just the
first<00:03:54.760> step<00:03:55.030> which<00:03:55.299> really<00:03:56.199> is<00:03:56.349> the<00:03:56.470> most

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
first step which really is the most

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.369 
first step which really is the most
important<00:03:57.069> step<00:03:57.280> which<00:03:58.209> is<00:03:58.299> answering<00:03:59.260> that

00:03:59.369 --> 00:03:59.379 
important step which is answering that

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:01.349 
important step which is answering that
question<00:03:59.560> why<00:03:59.979> you<00:04:00.040> do<00:04:00.370> what<00:04:00.400> you<00:04:00.549> do<00:04:00.819> and

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
question why you do what you do and

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:02.969 
question why you do what you do and
understanding<00:04:01.959> that<00:04:02.049> it<00:04:02.169> has<00:04:02.349> to<00:04:02.530> line<00:04:02.739> with

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:02.979 
understanding that it has to line with

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:06.149 
understanding that it has to line with
why<00:04:03.159> you<00:04:03.220> exist<00:04:03.489> in<00:04:03.849> the<00:04:03.909> first<00:04:04.030> place<00:04:05.159> once

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:06.159 
why you exist in the first place once

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:08.369 
why you exist in the first place once
you<00:04:06.280> get<00:04:06.519> to<00:04:06.639> that<00:04:06.669> point<00:04:07.000> and<00:04:07.329> lay<00:04:08.229> the

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:08.379 
you get to that point and lay the

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:10.649 
you get to that point and lay the
foundation<00:04:08.919> on<00:04:09.069> that<00:04:09.359> everything<00:04:10.359> else<00:04:10.540> has

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:10.659 
foundation on that everything else has

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:27.980 
foundation on that everything else has
to<00:04:10.780> flow<00:04:11.049> from<00:04:11.319> there

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990
