00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.370
 and well we are here we will go back comments 

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:07.100
 I bring you white gameplay all with 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.960
 the ballista so you are going to see a bit of 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.190
 choose it and well I do not know what was 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.810
 doing while I was playing the 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.540
 true or was it super pie of 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:16.519
 chop was playing by playing and you see 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.769
 that I'm super slow at the beginning and at 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:19.970
 final too but well just a 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:21.589
 time and we talked a bit about the 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.970
 sniper that by the way has already 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:26.689
 come out these maps that you are seeing 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.829
 for play 3 and for pc I imagine that good 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.300
 maybe when I'm uploading this 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:31.149
 video are not yet for pc because 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.590
 the updates on pc are like more 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:36.530
 late but nevertheless in place and that 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.789
 I'll have them already in the morning because 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.609
 they make them like with early morning hours 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:42.170
 in the USA or something similar but good 

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:44.660
 you already have it, I imagine that 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.309
 available in case someone wants to play 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.170
 or imagine that many are wishing 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.090
 play and other zombies on everything 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.070
 that is what I played more of 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.230
 this new tlc and even much more than 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.280
 the multiplayer and as I tell you was 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.289
 playing the trident with the sniper 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.699
 as you see here is a hit mark there to 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.679
 through the wood I do not even know where 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.719
 points was super breached between that 

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:05.059
 I was playing and good to figure a little 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.440
 that as it is we say that all those 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:11.390
 criticisms of playing with him 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.830
 etc as you see it is not to say I'm going to 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.120
 tell a little from my point of view 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.500
 that is, how do I play with the 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.920
 sniper and like me playing from 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.900
 that the cocolos and you already know that 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.280
 reports playing with sniper is 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.860
 you can simply use it as a 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.780
 weapon more is to say I for example kill 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.820
 let's say that a make a good game 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.990
 let's say that playing normal or how could 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.970
 play anyone not do 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.460
 watermarks or anything like that 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.770
 simply to what you come to play it 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.290
 what do I really like and kill 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.850
 many people then always use 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.740
 another quote as a weapon is to say 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.480
 as a tool imagine playing and 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.270
 that's not all for the best super 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.710
 small as knock down and what else 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.390
 I know what I most want with what more 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.220
 kill is with a sub-machine gun at best or with 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.810
 a escopetilla not so we put the 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.030
 competed to kill more then maybe 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.530
 there is a map on which you put a 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.940
 sniper and you kill more than if you played 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.380
 with a shotgun I know what I mean 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.090
 that is, it is always used 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.950
 sniper on those occasions in 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.780
 those that were better or the best option 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.960
 than any other weapon therefore 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.209
 encono city 4 is super useful in the name 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.620
 of 25 practically the same model of 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.500
 Her2 was also super last way 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.030
 maps on which planet was that you could 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.739
 bloat with the sniper and everything 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.599
 he spent super well they killed a lot more 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.000
 that already better with another weapon and then 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:25.250
 also when the back went out 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.230
 1 was when the disappointment began and it was 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.569
 when putting on a sniper was a 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.610
 mission of suicides was impossible you had 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.829
 a sniper and it's that he did not kill or 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.940
 is that it is not impossible to do 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:36.860
 a good game with a sniper 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:41.000
 you had to line up the 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.349
 stars and I that something happened 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.629
 incredible for me to get is for 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:47.209
 well to say get a good game 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:49.099
 however then the morgan came out to be 3 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.450
 and we said all of you that well it's not going to 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.739
 be something super good but more than 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.989
 same the maps were not good that's 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.359
 to play with the sniper that is 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.980
 have a weapon that you say oysters 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:00.620
 this is a good weapon that is not a 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.659
 weapon that would use it because in some 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.819
 Sometimes it is better not and good the truth 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:06.769
 it's something that caught my attention 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.450
 especially when this game came not 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.040
 because there are many maps in which 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.590
 example imagine afghan 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.969
 any map like that and quite large not 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.840
 is that a compiler is good because 

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:16.189
 then good games like 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.260
 sniper or I have good games 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:19.579
 with a sniper because let's say 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.189
 in this case it was the best option 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:24.019
 they used a sniper and the truth is that 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:25.310
 I do not know I want to walk 'you because I know 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.170
 than the rest of people who maybe 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.720
 play with the sniper to get out 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.709
 your montages or kill fitz and so on 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.209
 the best thing seemed to him that the modern 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.650
 warfare 3 where the truth is that I saw 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.569
 pretty people with the sniper and 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.010
 others because those seemed to be super 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:38.629
 good and so on I do not know what it is that has 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.129
 seemed this white all that yes that 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:42.709
 I know I have not seen many people 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:44.750
 complain and I've seen other times when 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.010
 when I see montages of people I see say 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.109
 that a lot of casualties and enough 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.019
 snipers uses the people that you 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:52.700
 you can put with this with the x pr with the 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:55.069
 Frank staple to give only the head 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.959
 let's say enough variety and these 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.310
 I seemed to ask all those 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.959
 how to play you with a 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.400
 sniper and how do you find him as 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.769
 compared to other call of duty if 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.079
 I have not told you that for me the best was 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.799
 with 84 in sniper account and also 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.510
 in modern warfare 2 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:10.790
 in fact I would say more the module for pigs 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.530
 for a reason why you put on 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.930
 play and you could get the streaks from 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.940
 away with the sniper and then already 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.760
 you put a little more 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.220
 to more closely advancing a little more 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.900
 and he brings from all runs as 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.810
 you can do a lot for back that 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.550
 example that with the 4 in fact there was 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.650
 maps that like for example map of 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.850
 matojos or the map on which always 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.230
 he used a lot of sniper and 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.390
 They took it out like in modern warfare2 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.920
 as a tlc not as a content 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.120
 downloadable basically as for example 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.590
 this map that you are seeing here not that 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.480
 it came out in the dark pack 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.550
 practically they took it out like a dlc and 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.440
 I swelled to kill seriously killed 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.970
 very much with the gusts until here 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.490
 we take air supports we take a 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.830
 bunch of thanks as I tell you and the 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.750
 agent personally did not like 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.590
 especially the pigs model I think it's 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.840
 the best 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.450
 say that all one example of how 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.980
 I was happy with him with the collector 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.930
 that is to say with a lot of people I thought that 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.120
 It was too easy, so play with 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.260
 he but let's say he can serve 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.790
 better a lot of people are the ones who 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.740
 I personally like where I remember 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.210
 that more French did but yes that is 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.580
 to say is true that in this game it is 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.870
 super balanced and the truth is that no 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.520
 you can also make very 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.290
 good with the sniper so nothing 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.220
 it is simply for you to tax 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.990
 in the comments what is it that you 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.310
 it seems the video has liked to vote it and 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.310
 we 're going to the next one just all
