00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.869 

although<00:00:57.899> it's<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.170> DSF<00:00:58.559> three<00:00:58.739> remote<00:00:59.129> app<00:00:59.399> it

actually<00:01:00.239> goes<00:01:00.539> together<00:01:00.780> with<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.230> BSF

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
actually goes together with the BSF

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.319 
actually goes together with the BSF
three<00:01:01.800> hardware<00:01:02.430> box<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:02.850> we<00:01:02.940> still<00:01:03.149> have<00:01:03.300> a

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
three hardware box so we still have a

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.780 
three hardware box so we still have a
virtual<00:01:03.870> zero<00:01:04.439> latency<00:01:04.710> hardware<00:01:05.489> where<00:01:05.670> the

virtual zero latency hardware where the
audio<00:01:06.030> runs<00:01:06.210> through<00:01:06.450> but<00:01:06.930> we<00:01:07.049> have<00:01:07.170> now<00:01:07.350> the

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
audio runs through but we have now the

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.810 
audio runs through but we have now the

physically having to touch the

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.730 
physically having to touch the
microphone<00:01:30.180> so<00:01:30.930> I'll<00:01:31.020> just<00:01:31.170> quickly<00:01:31.350> run<00:01:31.590> you

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740

through the features here first of all
we<00:01:34.229> have<00:01:34.350> microphone<00:01:34.860> rotate<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:35.880> without

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
we have microphone rotate so without

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.390 
we have microphone rotate so without
actually<00:01:36.810> touching<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.590> microphone<00:01:37.979> at<00:01:38.070> all

one of the issues with hanging

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:59.990 
one of the issues with hanging
microphone<00:01:59.040> this<00:01:59.189> stadium<00:01:59.640> is<00:01:59.729> that<00:01:59.909> the

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
microphone this stadium is that the

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.330 
microphone this stadium is that the
microphone<00:02:00.360> is<00:02:00.390> quite<00:02:00.810> high<00:02:01.020> up<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.469> when<00:02:02.189> you

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
microphone is quite high up and when you

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.330 
microphone is quite high up and when you
then<00:02:03.119> tilt<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.600> down<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:04.170> get<00:02:04.409> more<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:04.979> pick

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
then tilt it down to get more of a pick

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.370 
then tilt it down to get more of a pick
up<00:02:05.520> from<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.969> crowd<00:02:06.240> now<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.869> back<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.290> the

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
up from the crowd now the back of the

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.809 
up from the crowd now the back of the
microphone<00:02:07.770> is<00:02:07.799> actually<00:02:08.009> facing<00:02:08.640> in<00:02:08.729> the

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
microphone is actually facing in the

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.420 
microphone is actually facing in the
roof<00:02:09.000> which<00:02:09.270> is<00:02:09.390> not<00:02:09.539> maybe<00:02:09.989> what<00:02:10.259> you<00:02:10.379> want

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
roof which is not maybe what you want

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.970 
roof which is not maybe what you want
with<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.520> snap<00:02:11.790> tilt<00:02:12.060> in<00:02:12.900> software

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
with the snap tilt in software

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.759 
with the snap tilt in software
we<00:02:14.040> can<00:02:14.220> actually<00:02:14.519> independently<00:02:15.450> tilt<00:02:16.230> the

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
we can actually independently tilt the

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.070 
we can actually independently tilt the
rear<00:02:16.980> of<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.280> microphone<00:02:17.760> up<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:18.659> down<00:02:18.810> and

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
rear of the microphone up and down and

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.380 
rear of the microphone up and down and
the<00:02:19.620> front<00:02:19.860> of<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.069> microphone<00:02:20.549> up<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.209> down

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
the front of the microphone up and down

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.000 
the front of the microphone up and down
and<00:02:21.629> this<00:02:21.840> without<00:02:22.110> ever<00:02:22.379> touching<00:02:22.590> the

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
and this without ever touching the

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.430 
and this without ever touching the
microphone<00:02:23.670> if<00:02:24.510> you<00:02:24.599> wanted<00:02:24.989> to<00:02:25.049> change<00:02:25.230> the

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
microphone if you wanted to change the

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.470 
microphone if you wanted to change the
balance<00:02:25.650> of<00:02:25.980> your<00:02:26.040> 5.1<00:02:26.819> so<00:02:27.060> you<00:02:27.120> wanna<00:02:27.330> for

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
balance of your 5.1 so you wanna for

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.940 
balance of your 5.1 so you wanna for
example<00:02:27.810> emphasize<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.349> front<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.709> little<00:02:28.799> bit

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
example emphasize the front a little bit

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.979 
example emphasize the front a little bit
or<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.370> rear<00:02:29.580> a<00:02:29.610> little<00:02:29.940> bit<00:02:30.060> without<00:02:30.540> having

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
or the rear a little bit without having

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.240 
or the rear a little bit without having
to<00:02:31.080> spill<00:02:31.290> it<00:02:31.410> out<00:02:31.530> on<00:02:31.680> your<00:02:31.769> console<00:02:32.220> and

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
to spill it out on your console and

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.070 
to spill it out on your console and
trying<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:32.790> rebalance<00:02:33.120> it<00:02:33.450> you<00:02:33.900> can<00:02:34.049> just

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
trying to rebalance it you can just

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.500 
trying to rebalance it you can just
literally<00:02:34.470> move<00:02:34.830> this<00:02:35.040> control<00:02:35.970> here<00:02:36.299> and

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
literally move this control here and

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.650 
literally move this control here and
give<00:02:36.690> it<00:02:36.780> a<00:02:36.840> bit<00:02:36.959> more<00:02:37.140> focus<00:02:37.530> either<00:02:37.890> way

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
give it a bit more focus either way

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.240 
give it a bit more focus either way
similar<00:02:39.660> can<00:02:40.110> also<00:02:40.290> change<00:02:40.739> either

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
similar can also change either

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.280 
similar can also change either
individually<00:02:42.060> or<00:02:42.090> linked<00:02:42.690> together<00:02:42.870> as<00:02:43.170> is

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
individually or linked together as is

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.410 
individually or linked together as is
the<00:02:43.409> case<00:02:43.560> here<00:02:43.620> all<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.670> polar<00:02:44.879> patterns<00:02:45.269> so

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
the case here all the polar patterns so

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.900 
the case here all the polar patterns so
we<00:02:45.450> can<00:02:45.629> go<00:02:45.720> all<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.110> way<00:02:46.140> from<00:02:46.769> cardioids<00:02:47.340> to

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
we can go all the way from cardioids to

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.729 
we can go all the way from cardioids to
hyper-cardioid<00:02:48.599> or<00:02:48.959> anywhere<00:02:49.290> in<00:02:49.319> between

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
hyper-cardioid or anywhere in between

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.740 
hyper-cardioid or anywhere in between
and<00:02:49.950> this<00:02:50.340> makes<00:02:50.549> a<00:02:50.670> really<00:02:50.700> large<00:02:51.239> difference

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
and this makes a really large difference

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.020 
and this makes a really large difference
to<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:51.989> sound<00:02:52.230> you<00:02:52.500> get<00:02:53.430> it<00:02:53.640> might<00:02:53.819> really

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
to the sound you get it might really

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.089 
to the sound you get it might really
open<00:02:54.390> it<00:02:54.480> up<00:02:54.569> and<00:02:54.900> make<00:02:55.379> it<00:02:55.470> a<00:02:55.560> bit<00:02:55.680> more<00:02:55.799> crisp

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
open it up and make it a bit more crisp

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:57.650 
open it up and make it a bit more crisp
and<00:02:56.190> a<00:02:56.280> bit<00:02:56.400> more<00:02:56.519> bright<00:02:56.760> depending<00:02:57.329> on<00:02:57.450> your

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
and a bit more bright depending on your

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.170 
and a bit more bright depending on your
application<00:02:58.319> so<00:02:58.950> it's<00:02:59.310> a<00:02:59.430> very<00:02:59.700> very<00:02:59.849> flexible

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
application so it's a very very flexible

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.660 
application so it's a very very flexible
approach<00:03:01.140> to<00:03:01.440> fight<00:03:02.010> from<00:03:02.160> one<00:03:02.310> ambience

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
approach to fight from one ambience

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.849 
approach to fight from one ambience
miking<00:03:03.120> but<00:03:03.540> it's<00:03:03.720> very<00:03:04.019> very<00:03:04.260> simple<00:03:04.560> to<00:03:04.829> use

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
miking but it's very very simple to use

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:07.430 
miking but it's very very simple to use
and<00:03:05.549> now<00:03:06.090> with<00:03:06.299> the<00:03:06.390> DSF<00:03:06.720> free<00:03:06.900> remote<00:03:07.200> app

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
and now with the DSF free remote app

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.199 
and now with the DSF free remote app
rather<00:03:07.709> than<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.010> hardware<00:03:08.250> controls<00:03:08.760> it's

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
rather than the hardware controls it's

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.300 
rather than the hardware controls it's
also<00:03:09.390> very<00:03:09.720> very<00:03:09.840> visual<00:03:10.410> so<00:03:10.950> that<00:03:11.190> was<00:03:11.280> a

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
also very very visual so that was a

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.880 
also very very visual so that was a
little<00:03:11.519> overview<00:03:11.970> of<00:03:12.150> our<00:03:12.510> latest<00:03:12.959> remote<00:03:13.680> app

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
little overview of our latest remote app

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.609
