00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
got a 90-degree head on it so if you

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.069 
got a 90-degree head on it so if you
want<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:58.560> move<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.369> around<00:01:59.820> you<00:02:00.659> hold<00:02:00.930> in<00:02:01.049> your

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
hand you just do this you just turn it

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.690 
hand you just do this you just turn it
like<00:02:02.820> this<00:02:03.320> which<00:02:04.320> is<00:02:04.469> nice<00:02:04.680> because<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.549> don't

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
like this which is nice because I don't

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.880 
like this which is nice because I don't
want<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:05.939> it's<00:02:06.540> easier<00:02:06.840> than<00:02:06.960> been<00:02:07.469> doing<00:02:07.740> this

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
want to it's easier than been doing this

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.580 
want to it's easier than been doing this
and<00:02:08.459> it's<00:02:08.610> kind<00:02:08.789> of<00:02:08.819> cool<00:02:09.200> so<00:02:10.200> another<00:02:10.440> good

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
you know that's a nice feature

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.210 
you know that's a nice feature
so<00:02:46.200> I'm<00:02:46.260> going<00:02:46.380> to<00:02:46.440> turn<00:02:46.560> off<00:02:46.680> my<00:02:46.710> other<00:02:47.010> lights

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
so I'm going to turn off my other lights

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.890 
so I'm going to turn off my other lights
here<00:02:47.460> and<00:02:47.580> we'll<00:02:47.820> we'll<00:02:48.240> see<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.510> brightness

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
here and we'll we'll see the brightness

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.750 
here and we'll we'll see the brightness
of<00:02:49.080> it<00:02:50.120> so<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.240> low<00:02:51.450> mode<00:02:51.690> here<00:02:52.320> is<00:02:52.760> actually

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
of it so the low mode here is actually

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.750 
of it so the low mode here is actually
fairly<00:02:54.510> bright<00:02:54.780> I<00:02:55.050> mean<00:02:55.290> I<00:02:55.550> don't<00:02:56.550> know<00:02:56.610> if<00:02:56.670> you

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
fairly bright I mean I don't know if you

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.550 
fairly bright I mean I don't know if you
can<00:02:56.880> see<00:02:57.060> that<00:02:57.240> you<00:02:57.840> can't<00:02:58.050> really<00:02:58.200> see<00:02:58.440> it

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
can see that you can't really see it

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.130 
can see that you can't really see it
unfortunately<00:02:59.220> on<00:02:59.340> camera<00:02:59.730> but<00:03:00.570> it's<00:03:00.900> enough

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
unfortunately on camera but it's enough

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.770 
unfortunately on camera but it's enough
to<00:03:01.260> illuminate<00:03:01.670> more<00:03:02.670> than<00:03:02.910> more<00:03:03.420> than<00:03:03.600> like

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
to illuminate more than more than like

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.390 
to illuminate more than more than like
just<00:03:04.050> looking<00:03:04.260> for<00:03:04.410> your<00:03:04.530> keys<00:03:04.710> like<00:03:05.040> this

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
just looking for your keys like this

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.740 
just looking for your keys like this
would<00:03:05.550> be<00:03:05.640> perfect<00:03:06.030> for<00:03:06.060> looking<00:03:06.420> for<00:03:06.570> keys

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
would be perfect for looking for keys

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.800 
would be perfect for looking for keys
and<00:03:06.990> and<00:03:07.830> a<00:03:07.920> little<00:03:08.130> bit<00:03:08.250> extra<00:03:08.450> in<00:03:09.450> your<00:03:09.570> car

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
and and a little bit extra in your car

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.540 
and and a little bit extra in your car
or<00:03:09.990> whatever<00:03:10.460> so<00:03:11.780> number<00:03:12.780> two<00:03:12.990> mode<00:03:13.740> well

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
or whatever so number two mode well

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:15.140 
or whatever so number two mode well
let's<00:03:14.730> see

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
let's see

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.450 
let's see
camera's<00:03:15.840> not<00:03:16.110> even<00:03:16.710> really<00:03:17.010> pointed<00:03:17.310> at<00:03:17.400> the

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
camera's not even really pointed at the

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:23.330 
camera's not even really pointed at the
garbage<00:03:17.730> can<00:03:20.180> there's<00:03:21.180> the<00:03:21.300> garbage<00:03:21.600> can

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
garbage can there's the garbage can

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.940 
garbage can there's the garbage can
so<00:03:24.870> there's<00:03:25.870> the<00:03:26.019> garbage<00:03:26.260> can<00:03:26.409> on<00:03:26.500> mode<00:03:26.739> two

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
so there's the garbage can on mode two

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.179 
so there's the garbage can on mode two
pretty<00:03:27.849> nice<00:03:28.230> and<00:03:29.230> there's<00:03:29.409> mode<00:03:29.620> three<00:03:29.980> I

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:30.189 
pretty nice and there's mode three I

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:31.559 
pretty nice and there's mode three I
could<00:03:30.489> see<00:03:30.670> all<00:03:30.760> the<00:03:30.849> way<00:03:30.939> over<00:03:31.090> to<00:03:31.180> that<00:03:31.299> fence

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
could see all the way over to that fence

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:32.990 
could see all the way over to that fence
I<00:03:31.750> don't<00:03:31.870> know<00:03:31.930> if<00:03:31.989> it's<00:03:32.109> shown<00:03:32.260> up<00:03:32.409> on<00:03:32.530> camera

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
I don't know if it's shown up on camera

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.309 
I don't know if it's shown up on camera
but<00:03:34.000> it's<00:03:34.810> probably<00:03:36.299> you<00:03:37.299> know<00:03:37.329> it's<00:03:37.450> for

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
but it's probably you know it's for

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.009 
but it's probably you know it's for
flashlights<00:03:38.739> to<00:03:38.829> have<00:03:38.920> 18<00:03:39.219> 650s<00:03:39.819> or<00:03:39.939> two<00:03:40.150> cr123

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
flashlights to have 18 650s or two cr123

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:46.229 
flashlights to have 18 650s or two cr123
I'd<00:03:41.890> say<00:03:42.189> that<00:03:42.400> it's<00:03:43.530> at<00:03:44.530> like<00:03:44.799> the<00:03:45.239> level

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
I'd say that it's at like the level

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.660 
I'd say that it's at like the level
that's<00:03:47.049> like<00:03:47.470> two<00:03:47.709> below<00:03:47.980> the<00:03:48.099> highest<00:03:48.430> or

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
that's like two below the highest or

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.179 
that's like two below the highest or
it's<00:03:49.120> in<00:03:49.269> the<00:03:49.329> middle<00:03:49.420> mode<00:03:49.810> basically<00:03:50.189> so

00:03:51.179 --> 00:03:51.189 
it's in the middle mode basically so

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:53.039 
it's in the middle mode basically so
it's<00:03:51.340> it's<00:03:51.700> pretty<00:03:51.909> freakin<00:03:52.329> bright<00:03:52.540> for<00:03:52.900> how
