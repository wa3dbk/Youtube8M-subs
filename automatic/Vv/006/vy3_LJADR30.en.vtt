00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.359
 nice guys they are android there 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:09.780
 I show the fantastic games of 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:12.809
 water bike races and another one of 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:18.600
 machines that I loved a lot about 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:22.800
 does not repeat gp presented in the episode 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:29.160
 of the best games and real racing 2 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:34.890
 let's start with residue this game has 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:37.110
 need a 3g 2g wi fi network and i am 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.960
 currently with its rows 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.780
 oh well this game you can decide i 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.320
 commands this summer updated then 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.039
 appeared so are are various commands or 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.329
 an accelerometer passer and the newspaper 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:56.280
 automatic acceleration we see the 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:01:00.329
 initial video is a game that has me 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.280
 surprised a lot in the file while the 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:07.020
 video focuses on it 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:16.080
 here is a beautiful practice just me 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:19.350
 I started with golf gti 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.290
 easy to let you see the screen 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.030
 then as we can see on android is 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:30.080
 different because on ios 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.080
 the different setting 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:38.159
 the setting is different where it is 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:40.100
 the car then we have four today 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.299
 career mode with clocks that e 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.170
 time and box challenges 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:50.130
 if there are boxes we have the profile le 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.259
 my personal cars or our car and the 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.729
 There are cars on the market 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:02:03.719
 really a lot of cars do a race 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:06.259
 fast because then you acted 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.259
 we put you 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:15.319
 this that I or I must not do in the 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:21.290
 barrier and I'll see how that is with you 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:25.040
 of rom etro remember this weighs a 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.500
 because it has beautiful graphics 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.690
 sorry that it was right here is this 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.470
 my favourite 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:36.890
 if not so we can see everything 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:41.170
 then you see the cars when the net went up 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:43.760
 there will also be more powerful levels 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:48.380
 you always have to have some money for 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:52.459
 the cars that the other cars trickett is here 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:55.370
 difficult is my screen because from 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.769
 when even here is how you can see i 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.549
 details on these screens have been 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:06.110
 well cared for are fourteenth because 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:10.370
 I'm looking at the camera guys 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:13.280
 now I have to curve here by mistake or 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:18.500
 destroyed my front windshield goes 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:23.260
 this is this game to the detriment again 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:26.989
 outdated I don't want to show you why 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.660
 however, you have understood the objective 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.519
 we just have to try to win 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.630
 let's move on to the next game just 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:37.989
 ends loading vd vi do un 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.730
 advice when you have to leave the game 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:43.269
 come out you have to intense rewards back 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:47.169
 in short, I will lose myself on the start page 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:49.489
 doing the casting I was so the game 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:52.099
 the next one will work perfectly 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:56.419
 game is called gp and pay up 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:04:00.590
 soon gifts resume stop talk all 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:02.389
 the games were two minutes long 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.470
 counted then the fast deal here are 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:09.190
 very good we make a fast race and 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.190

 with the camera not focusing 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:49.470
