camera has another trick up its loop to

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.749 
camera has another trick up its loop to
help<00:01:19.020> with<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.530> that's<00:01:19.619> unboard<00:01:20.280> Wi-Fi

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
help with that and that's unboard Wi-Fi

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.490 
help with that and that's unboard Wi-Fi
it<00:01:21.030> creates<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.450> local<00:01:21.630> Wi-Fi<00:01:21.930> network<00:01:22.470> you

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
it creates a local Wi-Fi network you

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.320 
it creates a local Wi-Fi network you
connect<00:01:23.040> your<00:01:23.130> phone<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.700> fire<00:01:23.909> up<00:01:24.119> the

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
app and your phone then becomes a

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.520 
app and your phone then becomes a

control unit and display screen for the

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.130 
control unit and display screen for the

makes this waterproof up to a depth of

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.660 
makes this waterproof up to a depth of
about<00:01:47.369> 60<00:01:47.909> meters<00:01:48.240> just<00:01:48.680> clip<00:01:49.680> shut<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.220> this

this but there is a bicycle mount it is

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.460 
this but there is a bicycle mount it is
capable<00:02:07.560> of<00:02:07.860> taking<00:02:08.190> photos<00:02:08.989> cos<00:02:09.989> are<00:02:10.200> pretty

capable of taking photos cos are pretty

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.800 
capable of taking photos cos are pretty
good<00:02:10.679> it's<00:02:11.430> really<00:02:11.730> designed<00:02:12.030> for<00:02:12.120> wide-angle

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
good it's really designed for wide-angle

of<00:02:17.490> some<00:02:17.670> nice<00:02:17.850> scenery<00:02:18.140> so<00:02:19.140> here<00:02:19.260> we've<00:02:19.380> got

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
of some nice scenery so here we've got

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.080 
of some nice scenery so here we've got
some<00:02:19.680> moving<00:02:20.070> footage<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.640> as<00:02:20.730> you<00:02:20.820> can<00:02:20.940> see

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
some moving footage and as you can see

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.370 
some moving footage and as you can see
it<00:02:21.180> actually<00:02:21.450> stays<00:02:21.660> quite<00:02:21.930> stable<00:02:22.170> I'm

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
it actually stays quite stable I'm

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.590 
it actually stays quite stable I'm
simply<00:02:22.800> holding<00:02:23.460> this<00:02:23.610> while<00:02:23.910> in<00:02:24.420> the

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
simply holding this while in the

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.990 
simply holding this while in the
passenger<00:02:24.990> seat<00:02:25.170> and<00:02:25.440> even<00:02:26.190> on<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.520> side<00:02:26.730> and

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
passenger seat and even on the side and

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.310 
passenger seat and even on the side and
resting<00:02:27.270> on<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.450> side<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:27.780> going<00:02:27.960> over<00:02:28.140> some

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
resting on the side and going over some

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.290 
resting on the side and going over some
bumps<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:28.860> few<00:02:29.130> speed<00:02:29.400> bumps<00:02:29.430> it<00:02:29.880> still<00:02:30.120> stays

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
bumps a few speed bumps it still stays

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.150 
bumps a few speed bumps it still stays
nice<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.170> steady<00:02:31.290> now<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:31.680> test<00:02:31.980> this

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
nice and steady now to test this

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.430 
nice and steady now to test this
stabilization<00:02:32.850> further<00:02:33.480> I've<00:02:33.750> attached<00:02:34.230> it

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
stabilization further I've attached it

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.560 
stabilization further I've attached it
to<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:34.980> rake<00:02:35.280> it's<00:02:35.550> very<00:02:35.730> scientific<00:02:35.940> test<00:02:36.420> this

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
to a rake it's very scientific test this

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:37.820 
to a rake it's very scientific test this
now<00:02:37.110> we're<00:02:37.230> going<00:02:37.350> to<00:02:37.410> see<00:02:37.500> what<00:02:37.650> it's<00:02:37.770> like

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
now we're going to see what it's like

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.920 
now we're going to see what it's like
it's<00:02:38.130> a<00:02:38.250> DC<00:02:38.820> electric<00:02:38.940> bouncing<00:02:39.630> up<00:02:39.690> and<00:02:39.810> down

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
it's a DC electric bouncing up and down

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.800 
it's a DC electric bouncing up and down
and<00:02:40.320> actually<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.520> image<00:02:41.670> is<00:02:41.970> pretty<00:02:42.570> good

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
and actually the image is pretty good

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.900 
and actually the image is pretty good
and<00:02:43.020> it<00:02:43.380> stays<00:02:43.650> stable<00:02:43.890> even<00:02:44.370> if<00:02:44.580> you<00:02:44.730> are

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
and it stays stable even if you are

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.199 
and it stays stable even if you are
running<00:02:45.150> so<00:02:45.570> we<00:02:46.200> repeat<00:02:46.440> up<00:02:46.590> here<00:02:46.800> and<00:02:47.040> I<00:02:47.730> get

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
running so we repeat up here and I get

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.640 
running so we repeat up here and I get
down<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:48.480> garden<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:48.989> you<00:02:49.050> can<00:02:49.200> see<00:02:49.350> it<00:02:49.440> stays

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
down the garden and you can see it stays

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.400 
down the garden and you can see it stays
fairly<00:02:50.610> consistent<00:02:51.209> much<00:02:51.780> better<00:02:52.020> than<00:02:52.260> some

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
fairly consistent much better than some

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.780 
fairly consistent much better than some
cameras<00:02:52.739> now<00:02:52.860> up<00:02:52.980> close<00:02:53.220> you<00:02:53.370> can<00:02:53.489> see<00:02:53.640> you've

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
cameras now up close you can see you've

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.220 
cameras now up close you can see you've
got<00:02:53.820> a<00:02:54.030> bit<00:02:54.239> of<00:02:54.330> a<00:02:54.420> fisheye<00:02:54.750> effect<00:02:54.780> that's

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
got a bit of a fisheye effect that's

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.960 
got a bit of a fisheye effect that's
because<00:02:55.440> this<00:02:55.560> is<00:02:55.709> a<00:02:55.739> wide-angle<00:02:56.010> lens<00:02:56.310> so

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
because this is a wide-angle lens so

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.240 
because this is a wide-angle lens so
that<00:02:57.090> spider<00:02:57.420> running<00:02:57.780> and<00:02:57.980> it's<00:02:58.980> not<00:02:59.160> the

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
that spider running and it's not the

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.500 
that spider running and it's not the
best<00:02:59.280> camera<00:02:59.700> for<00:02:59.850> that<00:02:59.880> kind<00:03:00.150> of<00:03:00.180> close-up

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
best camera for that kind of close-up

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.570 
best camera for that kind of close-up
that's<00:03:00.750> not<00:03:00.900> always<00:03:01.080> designed<00:03:01.560> for<00:03:01.709> it<00:03:02.370> can

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
that's not always designed for it can

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.370 
that's not always designed for it can
however<00:03:02.760> do<00:03:03.060> some<00:03:03.270> very<00:03:03.450> nice<00:03:03.600> general<00:03:04.110> shots

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
however do some very nice general shots

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.800 
however do some very nice general shots
