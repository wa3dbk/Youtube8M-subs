00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
defender and that is pretty much what I

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.050 
defender and that is pretty much what I
went<00:02:49.240> with<00:02:49.480> in<00:02:49.750> my<00:02:49.930> team<00:02:50.230> I<00:02:50.500> decided<00:02:51.100> or<00:02:51.460> well<00:02:52.030> I

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
went with in my team I decided or well I

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.180 
went with in my team I decided or well I
didn't<00:02:52.450> really<00:02:52.690> decide<00:02:53.050> but<00:02:53.320> I<00:02:53.380> did<00:02:53.680> hear<00:02:54.010> that

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
didn't really decide but I did hear that

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.640 
didn't really decide but I did hear that
a<00:02:54.550> lot<00:02:54.670> of<00:02:54.970> my<00:02:55.180> team<00:02:55.480> players<00:02:55.810> are<00:02:56.140> shooting

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
a lot of my team players are shooting

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.830 
a lot of my team players are shooting
three-point<00:02:57.220> shots<00:02:57.580> and<00:02:57.880> they're<00:02:58.540> pretty

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
three-point shots and they're pretty

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.050 
three-point shots and they're pretty
much<00:02:59.500> making<00:02:59.830> them<00:03:00.190> with<00:03:00.459> a<00:03:00.489> very<00:03:00.760> high

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
much making them with a very high

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.810 
much making them with a very high
percentage<00:03:01.690> so<00:03:02.080> I<00:03:02.110> decided<00:03:02.500> to<00:03:02.620> go<00:03:02.860> with<00:03:03.459> a<00:03:03.489> few

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
percentage so I decided to go with a few

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.610 
percentage so I decided to go with a few
players<00:03:04.180> that<00:03:04.360> are<00:03:04.720> great<00:03:05.020> perimeter

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
players that are great perimeter

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.710 
players that are great perimeter
defenders<00:03:06.220> but<00:03:06.820> also<00:03:07.030> throughout<00:03:07.660> the

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
defenders but also throughout the

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.770 
defenders but also throughout the

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
because quite frankly I don't have time

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.830 
because quite frankly I don't have time
to<00:03:53.739> save<00:03:53.980> up<00:03:54.160> all<00:03:54.370> these<00:03:54.519> VC<00:03:55.090> and<00:03:55.360> pretty<00:03:55.630> much

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
to save up all these VC and pretty much

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.200 
to save up all these VC and pretty much
the<00:03:56.080> 50k<00:03:56.680> that<00:03:56.950> I<00:03:56.980> had<00:03:57.280> to<00:03:57.519> start<00:03:57.760> out<00:03:57.940> this

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:58.210 
the 50k that I had to start out this

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.530 
the 50k that I had to start out this
series<00:03:58.510> they're<00:03:59.380> all<00:03:59.560> gone<00:03:59.860> and<00:04:00.760> I<00:04:01.210> didn't

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
series they're all gone and I didn't

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.570 
series they're all gone and I didn't
really<00:04:01.780> get<00:04:01.900> any<00:04:02.170> great<00:04:02.500> players<00:04:02.830> in<00:04:02.950> return

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
really get any great players in return

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.150 
really get any great players in return
so<00:04:03.820> that<00:04:04.000> was<00:04:04.150> a<00:04:04.180> total<00:04:04.690> bust<00:04:05.170> but<00:04:05.530> hopefully

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
so that was a total bust but hopefully

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.420 
so that was a total bust but hopefully
hopefully<00:04:06.910> in<00:04:07.630> a<00:04:07.750> week<00:04:07.990> or<00:04:08.230> two<00:04:08.440> I<00:04:08.470> can<00:04:08.920> collect

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
hopefully in a week or two I can collect

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.670 
hopefully in a week or two I can collect
