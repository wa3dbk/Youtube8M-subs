welcome<00:00:22.930> to<00:00:23.169> our<00:00:23.200> eighth<00:00:23.470> technical<00:00:24.340> problem

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
welcome to our eighth technical problem

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.310 
welcome to our eighth technical problem
how<00:00:25.960> easily<00:00:26.470> and<00:00:27.179> musically<00:00:28.179> play<00:00:29.080> large

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
how easily and musically play large

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:41.900 
how easily and musically play large
escapes

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.349 

so<00:00:43.019> skips<00:00:44.019> are<00:00:44.260> nothing<00:00:44.649> more<00:00:44.859> than<00:00:45.359> single

00:00:46.349 --> 00:00:46.359 
so skips are nothing more than single

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:48.840 
so skips are nothing more than single
notes<00:00:46.570> or<00:00:46.930> chords<00:00:47.440> that<00:00:47.800> are<00:00:47.859> separated<00:00:48.609> by<00:00:48.820> a

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
notes or chords that are separated by a

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.500 
notes or chords that are separated by a
lot<00:00:49.390> of<00:00:49.629> distance<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:51.550> this<00:00:51.670> creates<00:00:52.420> a

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
lot of distance so this creates a

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.329 
lot of distance so this creates a
challenge<00:00:52.960> for<00:00:53.140> us<00:00:53.199> right<00:00:53.469> how<00:00:53.890> do<00:00:53.949> we<00:00:54.100> find

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:54.339 
challenge for us right how do we find

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:55.950 
challenge for us right how do we find
the<00:00:54.460> notes<00:00:54.640> in<00:00:54.789> the<00:00:54.879> first<00:00:55.149> place<00:00:55.329> and<00:00:55.719> then

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
the notes in the first place and then

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.410 
the notes in the first place and then
how<00:00:56.949> do<00:00:57.010> we<00:00:57.190> play<00:00:57.489> them<00:00:57.729> in<00:00:57.820> an<00:00:57.969> easy<00:00:58.269> manner

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
how do we play them in an easy manner

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.560 
how do we play them in an easy manner
such<00:00:59.199> that<00:00:59.229> it<00:00:59.769> doesn't<00:01:00.190> upset<00:01:00.610> the<00:01:00.879> flow<00:01:01.239> of

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
such that it doesn't upset the flow of

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:08.820 
such that it doesn't upset the flow of
the<00:01:02.140> music<00:01:03.720> let's<00:01:04.720> check<00:01:05.019> it<00:01:05.170> out<00:01:07.710> let's<00:01:08.710> go

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
right now this pattern is absolutely

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.609 
right now this pattern is absolutely
awesome<00:01:43.929> for<00:01:44.709> exposing<00:01:45.100> any<00:01:45.549> tension<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:47.439> is

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
awesome for exposing any tension that is

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:50.100 
awesome for exposing any tension that is
created<00:01:48.100> by<00:01:48.280> not<00:01:48.520> allowing<00:01:48.789> your<00:01:49.270> power<00:01:49.630> and

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
created by not allowing your power and

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.510 
created by not allowing your power and
control<00:01:50.920> to<00:01:51.909> flow<00:01:52.509> from<00:01:53.500> your<00:01:53.560> Center<00:01:54.100> right

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
control to flow from your Center right

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.469 
control to flow from your Center right
that<00:01:55.119> is<00:01:55.360> by<00:01:55.689> using<00:01:56.350> your<00:01:56.619> upper<00:01:56.979> arms<00:01:57.579> to

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
that is by using your upper arms to

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.480 
that is by using your upper arms to
guide<00:01:58.689> the<00:01:58.899> action<00:01:59.350> of<00:01:59.439> your<00:01:59.590> forearms<00:02:00.280> and

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
guide the action of your forearms and

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.510 
guide the action of your forearms and
hand<00:02:00.789> and<00:02:01.090> fingers<00:02:01.630> rather<00:02:02.350> than<00:02:02.710> the<00:02:03.250> other

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
hand and fingers rather than the other

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.990 
hand and fingers rather than the other
way<00:02:03.609> around<00:02:04.409> okay<00:02:05.609> now<00:02:06.609> there<00:02:06.789> are<00:02:06.880> at<00:02:06.969> least

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
way around okay now there are at least

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.660 
way around okay now there are at least
seven<00:02:07.869> key<00:02:08.320> elements<00:02:08.979> that<00:02:09.009> help<00:02:09.280> us<00:02:09.519> achieve

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
seven key elements that help us achieve

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.380 
seven key elements that help us achieve
the<00:02:10.359> sense<00:02:10.780> of<00:02:11.109> central<00:02:11.739> control<00:02:12.160> let's<00:02:13.150> take

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
the sense of central control let's take

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.690 
the sense of central control let's take
a<00:02:13.450> look
