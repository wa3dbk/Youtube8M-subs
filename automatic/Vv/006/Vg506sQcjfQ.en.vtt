00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.830
 service youtube and come on our 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.840
 channel beats aliens and today it works 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.960
 therefore we have the op telegate 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.350
 or michaels car in online 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.650
 can get mode and behave year 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:33.030
 times to first proof as you see 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:35.880
 I have him that is the same time so im 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:43.340
 background with me he is here and 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:52.860
 on the map looked at the airport 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:54.199
 and yes I have a list of simeon 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.539
 to get 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:02.219
 he said he wants the overtake 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.969
 and then I thought of a video 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.979
 watched 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.700
 in youtube and her all said on 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.890
 golf course at the golf course I am almost 1000 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.920
 times more in and out one 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.710
 Going in rather drove and he is 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.240
 just never saved and then I have 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.030
 nor a video watched then he 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.280
 I'm at the airport at the airport 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:28.049
 then drove a couple of laps and three times 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.790
 then he is actually band and day 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.729
 So I'm starting to just find it 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.729
 cool because the car is that the 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.040
 second fastest limousine here and is 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.520
 Almost nobody has author 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.390
 just brutally hard to find so that 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:48.450
 car into the portal difficult to find 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:51.060
 and yes as I said he needs the list 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.189
 from simeon then fatih here and then 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.409
 you should just stand here so 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.700
 I guess probably needs 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.990
 certainly needs to consume the list 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.479
 and then you probably still need 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.460
 such a particular car so a colleague 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.950
 from me as with the witch made so 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.349
 the motorcycle 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.810
 Some have to say with the motorcycling 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:13.129
 others say with whom I guess 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.890
 times that it does not matter what with now 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:19.010
 found any car 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:24.620
 I sometimes know what it's called and 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:25.099
 yes, if you are almost looking for it and not 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.360
 finds 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:32.000
 then write me a message and 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:35.510
 over the xbox and I press him 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.160
 you then that he then with you 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.720
 So even in the garage is not here 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.269
 are so to drive around that he's off 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:45.799
 is actually insured for you 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:46.849
 the her the warrant can and yes to 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.940
 we just have a message 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:51.709
 So you do not have to write now 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.200
 Subscribe specially but who also 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:58.040

00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:00.250
 So as I said when I have nothing 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.250
 made 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.569
 yes yes yes as I said so if you want 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:10.010
 then just write a message 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:10.730
 over the xbox xbox gamer tag is in the 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:17.900
 description 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:19.870

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.200
 partie 1 or into the game 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:26.000
