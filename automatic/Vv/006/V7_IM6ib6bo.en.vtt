00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
software and now it seems like sales is

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.980 
software and now it seems like sales is
following<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.490> move<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.000> marketing<00:01:18.509> is

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
following that move and marketing is

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.010 
following that move and marketing is
