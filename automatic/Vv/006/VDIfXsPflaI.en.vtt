00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.040 
the game saves and there's the
checkpoints<00:02:11.680> where<00:02:12.030> it<00:02:13.030> saves<00:02:13.450> but<00:02:13.720> you<00:02:13.810> can't

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
checkpoints where it saves but you can't

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.680 
checkpoints where it saves but you can't
reload<00:02:14.410> from<00:02:14.740> it's<00:02:15.550> fucking<00:02:15.910> confusing<00:02:16.390> and

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
reload from it's fucking confusing and

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.210 
reload from it's fucking confusing and
it<00:02:16.900> took<00:02:17.080> me<00:02:17.110> a<00:02:17.260> while<00:02:17.440> to<00:02:17.500> figure<00:02:17.800> out<00:02:17.980> that

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
it took me a while to figure out that

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.070 
it took me a while to figure out that
what<00:02:18.370> was<00:02:18.460> even<00:02:18.670> going<00:02:18.820> on<00:02:19.030> but<00:02:19.240> like<00:02:19.360> at<00:02:19.990> the

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
what was even going on but like at the

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.220 
what was even going on but like at the
beginning<00:02:20.200> of<00:02:20.530> this<00:02:20.650> video<00:02:20.830> was<00:02:21.840> a<00:02:22.840> real

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
beginning of this video was a real

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.900 
beginning of this video was a real
checkpoint<00:02:23.830> I<00:02:23.950> guess<00:02:24.100> you<00:02:24.250> can<00:02:24.370> call<00:02:24.550> it<00:02:24.610> and

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
checkpoint I guess you can call it and

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.640 
checkpoint I guess you can call it and
there<00:02:25.030> are<00:02:25.150> like<00:02:25.420> sub<00:02:25.840> checkpoints<00:02:26.410> in<00:02:26.500> this

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
there are like sub checkpoints in this

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.280 
there are like sub checkpoints in this
level<00:02:26.950> where<00:02:27.210> if<00:02:28.210> you<00:02:28.360> die<00:02:28.600> you<00:02:28.660> go<00:02:28.840> back<00:02:29.140> to

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
level where if you die you go back to

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.080 
level where if you die you go back to
them<00:02:29.440> but<00:02:29.770> if<00:02:29.860> you<00:02:29.950> quit<00:02:30.220> you<00:02:30.520> go<00:02:30.760> back<00:02:30.940> even

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
them but if you quit you go back even

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.420 
them but if you quit you go back even
further<00:02:31.210> if<00:02:32.200> that<00:02:32.410> makes<00:02:32.620> sense<00:02:32.770> yeah<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:35.430> we

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
further if that makes sense yeah and we

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.040 
further if that makes sense yeah and we
just<00:02:36.910> kept<00:02:37.060> getting<00:02:37.150> disconnected<00:02:37.480> and

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
just kept getting disconnected and

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.490 
just kept getting disconnected and
disconnected<00:02:38.590> over<00:02:38.770> and<00:02:38.890> over<00:02:38.980> again<00:02:39.190> and

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
disconnected over and over again and

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.780 
disconnected over and over again and
that's<00:02:41.500> why<00:02:41.740> I<00:02:41.770> have<00:02:42.100> the<00:02:42.220> grenade<00:02:42.460> launcher

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
that's why I have the grenade launcher

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.940 
that's why I have the grenade launcher
when<00:02:43.390> I<00:02:43.420> shouldn't<00:02:43.840> have<00:02:43.900> had<00:02:44.050> it<00:02:44.170> yet<00:02:44.350> that

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
when I shouldn't have had it yet that

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
when I shouldn't have had it yet that
was<00:02:45.100> a<00:02:46.380> like<00:02:47.380> two<00:02:47.680> minute<00:02:48.010> description<00:02:48.310> of<00:02:48.790> how

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
was a like two minute description of how

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.960 
was a like two minute description of how
you<00:02:49.030> have<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.600> grenade<00:02:49.900> launcher<00:02:50.290> well<00:02:50.470> the

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
you have the grenade launcher well the

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.040 
you have the grenade launcher well the
system<00:02:51.970> fucking<00:02:52.330> worked<00:02:52.540> it<00:02:52.750> wouldn't<00:02:52.959> be<00:02:53.020> a

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
system fucking worked it wouldn't be a

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.420 
system fucking worked it wouldn't be a
problem<00:02:53.290> no<00:02:53.680> you<00:02:53.740> might<00:02:54.010> have<00:02:54.100> noticed<00:02:54.130> that

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
problem no you might have noticed that

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.640 
problem no you might have noticed that
at<00:02:54.610> the<00:02:54.700> beginning<00:02:54.790> of<00:02:55.090> this<00:02:55.240> I<00:02:55.530> dropped<00:02:56.530> a

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
at the beginning of this I dropped a

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.140 
at the beginning of this I dropped a
couple<00:02:56.830> minds<00:02:57.430> right<00:02:57.640> where<00:02:57.790> I<00:02:57.820> know<00:02:57.910> those

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
couple minds right where I know those

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.890 
couple minds right where I know those
guys<00:02:58.209> were<00:02:58.480> going<00:02:58.600> to<00:02:58.690> spawn<00:02:58.959> but<00:02:59.410> I<00:03:00.900> don't

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
guys were going to spawn but I don't

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.980 
guys were going to spawn but I don't
know<00:03:01.959> they<00:03:02.620> spawned<00:03:03.130> past<00:03:03.490> them<00:03:03.820> or<00:03:04.120> what<00:03:04.840> one

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
know they spawned past them or what one

know they spawned past them or what one
of<00:03:05.020> the<00:03:05.140> earlier<00:03:05.470> guys<00:03:05.650> already<00:03:05.950> killed<00:03:06.220> them

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
of the earlier guys already killed them

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.110 
of the earlier guys already killed them

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
utilized very much up to this point the

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.300 
utilized very much up to this point the

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:33.510 
run past him and run away and there's

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:37.100 
run past him and run away and there's
even<00:06:33.750> like<00:06:33.840> cutscenes<00:06:34.320> that<00:06:34.500> imply<00:06:35.400> that<00:06:36.110> you

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.110 
even like cutscenes that imply that you

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.350
