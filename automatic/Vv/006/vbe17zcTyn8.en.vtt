00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.470 
to fall for you this look is inspired by
the<00:00:06.839> deer<00:00:07.649> home<00:00:07.890> spring<00:00:08.460> so<00:00:08.639> much<00:00:08.820> doesn't<00:00:09.150> the

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
the deer home spring so much doesn't the

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.900 
the deer home spring so much doesn't the
teeny<00:00:09.870> number<00:00:10.290> by<00:00:10.380> my<00:00:10.530> looks<00:00:10.710> and<00:00:10.980> it's<00:00:11.610> just<00:00:11.759> a

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
teeny number by my looks and it's just a

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.959 
teeny number by my looks and it's just a
very<00:00:12.240> very<00:00:12.679> clean<00:00:13.679> and<00:00:14.070> very<00:00:14.099> very<00:00:14.610> like

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
very very clean and very very like

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.140 
very very clean and very very like
old-school<00:00:15.619> side<00:00:16.619> parting<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.670> just<00:00:18.000> like<00:00:18.119> a

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
old-school side parting and just like a

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.660 
old-school side parting and just like a
very<00:00:18.449> flat<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:18.810> shiny<00:00:19.199> look<00:00:19.470> I<00:00:19.740> seen<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:20.550> in

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
very flat and shiny look I seen it in

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.880 
very flat and shiny look I seen it in
like<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.850> lot<00:00:21.150> of<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.359> shows<00:00:22.170> during<00:00:22.650> that

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
like a lot of the shows during that

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.170 
like a lot of the shows during that
season<00:00:23.100> so<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.490> thought<00:00:23.670> it<00:00:23.789> would<00:00:23.850> be<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.029> good

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
season so I thought it would be a good

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.570 
season so I thought it would be a good
idea<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.539> do<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:25.949> more<00:00:26.279> like<00:00:26.430> an

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
idea to do it it is a more like an

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.460 
idea to do it it is a more like an
editorial<00:00:27.210> look<00:00:27.390> so<00:00:27.750> I<00:00:27.779> don't<00:00:27.990> think<00:00:28.199> at<00:00:28.320> the

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
editorial look so I don't think at the

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.009 
editorial look so I don't think at the
very<00:00:28.920> like<00:00:29.310> street<00:00:29.609> style<00:00:30.150> kind<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.689> friendly

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
very like street style kind of friendly

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.930 
very like street style kind of friendly
but<00:00:31.679> i<00:00:31.710> think<00:00:31.980> you<00:00:32.009> know<00:00:32.160> if<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:32.460> can<00:00:32.610> rock<00:00:32.790> out

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
this is a very flat tutorial tutorial a

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.369 
this is a very flat tutorial tutorial a
very<00:00:55.590> flat<00:00:55.890> kind<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.340> i'm<00:00:56.550> here<00:00:56.820> look<00:00:57.030> so<00:00:57.690> what

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
very flat kind of i'm here look so what

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.200 
very flat kind of i'm here look so what
i<00:00:58.410> would<00:00:58.530> recommend<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:59.250> if<00:00:59.460> you<00:00:59.609> do<00:00:59.910> have

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
i would recommend this if you do have

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.930 
i would recommend this if you do have
more<00:01:00.539> curly<00:01:00.960> hair<00:01:01.460> you<00:01:02.460> should<00:01:02.760> probably

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
more curly hair you should probably

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.200 
more curly hair you should probably
strayed<00:01:03.809> in<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:04.409> i<00:01:04.650> would<00:01:05.159> probably<00:01:05.640> let<00:01:05.880> it

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
strayed in it so i would probably let it

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.530 
strayed in it so i would probably let it
air<00:01:06.869> dry<00:01:06.900> first<00:01:07.619> because<00:01:08.460> i<00:01:08.580> feel<00:01:08.850> like<00:01:09.060> when

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
air dry first because i feel like when

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.410 
air dry first because i feel like when
you<00:01:09.570> do<00:01:09.900> blow<00:01:10.680> dryer<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.369> does<00:01:11.520> some<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.970> lot<00:01:12.299> of

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
you do blow dryer it does some a lot of

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.969 
you do blow dryer it does some a lot of
all<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.930> your<00:01:13.020> hair<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.500> don't<00:01:13.740> want

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
all you to your hair and you don't want

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.940 
all you to your hair and you don't want
that<00:01:14.040> so<00:01:14.390> yeah<00:01:15.390> if<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.750> can<00:01:16.020> just<00:01:16.080> let<00:01:16.590> your

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
that so yeah if you can just let your

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.120 
that so yeah if you can just let your
hair<00:01:17.130> air<00:01:17.970> dry<00:01:18.030> or<00:01:19.020> towel<00:01:19.350> drive<00:01:19.680> as<00:01:19.890> well<00:01:19.920> as

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.360 
don't actually iron gel i'm going to use
some<00:02:11.570> mousse<00:02:11.810> so<00:02:12.080> I<00:02:12.110> just<00:02:12.350> have<00:02:12.560> this<00:02:12.740> moose<00:02:13.070> by

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
some mousse so I just have this moose by

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:21.970 
some mousse so I just have this moose by
arms<00:02:13.790> Rosco<00:02:15.220> so<00:02:16.220> put<00:02:16.790> on<00:02:17.030> my<00:02:17.420> hand<00:02:17.690> a<00:02:20.980> little

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
arms Rosco so put on my hand a little

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.710 
arms Rosco so put on my hand a little
bit<00:02:22.130> start<00:02:22.610> off<00:02:22.760> with<00:02:23.030> and<00:02:23.270> then<00:02:23.360> we'll<00:02:23.510> see

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
bit start off with and then we'll see

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:37.980 
bit start off with and then we'll see
how<00:02:23.870> we<00:02:23.930> go

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.170 

so<00:02:38.770> at<00:02:38.890> this<00:02:38.920> stage<00:02:39.100> I'm<00:02:39.550> just<00:02:39.760> going<00:02:39.940> to<00:02:40.000> grab

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
so at this stage I'm just going to grab

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.230 
so at this stage I'm just going to grab
a<00:02:40.270> little<00:02:40.540> caring<00:02:41.050> minimun<00:02:41.610> try<00:02:42.610> to<00:02:43.440> get<00:02:44.440> a<00:02:45.240> bit

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
a little caring minimun try to get a bit

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:56.840 
a little caring minimun try to get a bit
of<00:02:46.270> precision<00:02:46.900> precision<00:02:47.350> going<00:02:48.190> this<00:02:48.550> look

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.250 

so<00:02:57.850> now<00:02:58.030> you<00:02:58.090> can<00:02:58.390> hopefully<00:02:58.600> see<00:02:58.810> that<00:02:59.080> it's

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
so now you can hopefully see that it's

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.170 
so now you can hopefully see that it's
starting<00:02:59.680> to<00:02:59.800> kind<00:03:00.010> of<00:03:00.130> resemble<00:03:00.700> that<00:03:00.880> look

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
starting to kind of resemble that look

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.790 
starting to kind of resemble that look
that<00:03:01.480> was<00:03:01.990> on<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:02.260> runway<00:03:03.900> but<00:03:04.900> I<00:03:05.200> think<00:03:05.650> it

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
that was on the runway but I think it

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.180 
that was on the runway but I think it
needs<00:03:05.860> a<00:03:06.190> bit<00:03:06.400> more<00:03:06.690> shine<00:03:07.710> we<00:03:08.710> believe<00:03:09.040> it<00:03:09.160> I

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
needs a bit more shine we believe it I

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.440 
needs a bit more shine we believe it I
think<00:03:09.250> we<00:03:09.460> need<00:03:09.520> a<00:03:09.670> little<00:03:09.760> bit<00:03:10.090> more<00:03:10.210> shots

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
think we need a little bit more shots

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.450 
think we need a little bit more shots
i'm<00:03:10.660> going<00:03:10.780> to<00:03:10.840> use<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.980> american<00:03:12.340> crew
