00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:15.760 
be proportionate with the exception of

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.300 
be proportionate with the exception of
maybe<00:06:16.090> a<00:06:16.300> muumuu<00:06:16.950> everything<00:06:17.950> is<00:06:18.070> really

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.430 
proportionate to how it would be next to
a<00:06:21.010> champion<00:06:21.790> or<00:06:22.000> in<00:06:22.180> relation<00:06:22.510> to<00:06:22.900> a<00:06:22.930> champion
