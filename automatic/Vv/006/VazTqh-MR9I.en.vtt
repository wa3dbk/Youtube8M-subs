00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
so what I grab is just my trusty paring

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.070 
so what I grab is just my trusty paring
knife<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:23.210> stick<00:00:24.210> it<00:00:24.359> in<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.509> onion<00:00:25.050> just

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
knife and stick it in the onion just

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:36.260 
knife and stick it in the onion just
like<00:00:25.499> that<00:00:26.419> and<00:00:27.890> cuts<00:00:29.599> back<00:00:30.599> in<00:00:30.929> for<00:00:31.289> Earths

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.099 

just<00:00:37.020> like<00:00:37.260> that

00:00:40.099 --> 00:00:40.109 

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:42.319 

and<00:00:40.589> when<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.859> come<00:00:41.039> almost<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.789> end<00:00:41.999> you

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
and when you come almost to the end you

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.569 
and when you come almost to the end you
kind<00:00:42.539> of<00:00:42.629> have<00:00:42.839> to<00:00:43.050> see<00:00:43.350> where<00:00:43.710> your<00:00:43.859> last<00:00:44.129> cut

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
kind of have to see where your last cut

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.829 
kind of have to see where your last cut
is<00:00:44.789> so<00:00:45.659> you<00:00:45.750> can<00:00:46.079> match<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.379> up<00:00:46.800> so<00:00:47.640> probably<00:00:48.239> my

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:48.839 
is so you can match it up so probably my

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:50.899 
is so you can match it up so probably my
next<00:00:48.899> cut<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:49.679> should<00:00:49.949> start<00:00:50.370> right<00:00:50.729> around

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:50.909 
next cut that should start right around

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:55.639 
next cut that should start right around
here<00:00:52.129> just<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.309> match<00:00:53.549> up<00:00:53.969> if<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:55.140> don't<00:00:55.350> do

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
here just to match up if you don't do

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.969 
here just to match up if you don't do
that<00:00:55.920> then<00:00:56.489> you<00:00:56.670> will<00:00:56.879> not<00:00:57.119> end<00:00:57.570> up<00:00:57.930> with<00:00:58.799> an

00:00:58.969 --> 00:00:58.979 
that then you will not end up with an

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:05.600 
that then you will not end up with an
even<00:00:59.430> pattern<00:01:02.030> so<00:01:03.680> just<00:01:04.680> make<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.129> two-inch

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
even pattern so just make the two-inch

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.779 
even pattern so just make the two-inch
connects<00:01:06.390> now<00:01:07.350> what<00:01:07.560> will<00:01:07.770> happen<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:09.320> your

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:10.789 
connects now what will happen is your

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:14.630 
connects now what will happen is your
onion<00:01:11.789> will<00:01:12.000> open<00:01:12.619> so<00:01:13.619> what<00:01:13.770> we'll<00:01:13.979> do<00:01:14.220> is

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
onion will open so what we'll do is

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.740 
onion will open so what we'll do is
we'll<00:01:14.880> peel<00:01:15.390> off<00:01:15.920> this<00:01:16.920> first<00:01:17.340> layer

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
we'll peel off this first layer

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.960 
we'll peel off this first layer
something<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:19.049> should<00:01:19.319> have<00:01:19.350> done<00:01:19.619> before<00:01:19.970> cut

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
something I should have done before cut

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.149 
something I should have done before cut
off<00:01:21.149> the<00:01:21.330> end<00:01:21.569> so<00:01:21.750> it'll<00:01:22.080> be<00:01:22.229> flat<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.619> little

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
off the end so it'll be flat a little

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:29.180 
off the end so it'll be flat a little
bit<00:01:23.420> after<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.659> what<00:01:25.590> we<00:01:25.799> do<00:01:26.090> is<00:01:28.130> make<00:01:29.130> a

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
bit after this what we do is make a

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.949 
bit after this what we do is make a
little<00:01:30.110> slice<00:01:31.110> in<00:01:31.530> here<00:01:32.509> and<00:01:33.509> what<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.810> will

00:01:33.949 --> 00:01:33.959 
little slice in here and what you will

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:39.840 
little slice in here and what you will
do<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.590> take<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.250> layers<00:01:35.580> apart

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.340 

of<00:01:40.300> the<00:01:40.659> onion<00:01:41.080> so<00:01:41.260> you<00:01:41.350> start<00:01:41.620> the<00:01:41.710> peel<00:01:42.190> um

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
of the onion so you start the peel um

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.390 
of the onion so you start the peel um
one<00:01:44.350> by<00:01:44.620> one<00:01:45.720> but<00:01:46.720> you<00:01:46.930> start<00:01:47.260> doing<00:01:47.530> then<00:01:48.010> is

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
one by one but you start doing then is

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:56.130 
one by one but you start doing then is
you<00:01:49.270> twist<00:01:50.760> every<00:01:51.760> layer<00:01:52.120> a<00:01:53.430> little<00:01:54.430> bit<00:01:55.140> so

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
you twist every layer a little bit so

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.660 
you twist every layer a little bit so
that<00:01:56.700> petals<00:01:57.700> in<00:01:58.180> between<00:01:59.050> the<00:01:59.410> cuts<00:01:59.710> will<00:02:00.640> be

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
that petals in between the cuts will be

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.770 
that petals in between the cuts will be
visible

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.780 

and<00:02:07.200> when<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.770> do<00:02:07.980> so<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:09.500> end<00:02:10.500> up<00:02:10.830> with<00:02:11.670> the

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
and when you do so you end up with the

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.830 
and when you do so you end up with the
pretty<00:02:12.090> flower

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
pretty flower

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.650 
pretty flower
