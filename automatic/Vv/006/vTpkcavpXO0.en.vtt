because uh oh I know that teaching

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.770 
because uh oh I know that teaching
private<00:00:39.609> lessons<00:00:40.030> that<00:00:40.179> some<00:00:40.359> of<00:00:40.420> my<00:00:40.480> students

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
private lessons that some of my students

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.209 
private lessons that some of my students
have<00:00:40.839> had<00:00:40.960> issues<00:00:41.320> with<00:00:41.530> this<00:00:41.829> and<00:00:42.070> let's

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:42.219 
have had issues with this and let's

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:44.610 
have had issues with this and let's
cover<00:00:42.579> what's<00:00:42.879> the<00:00:42.999> most<00:00:43.149> difficult<00:00:43.690> aspect

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
cover what's the most difficult aspect

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.459 
cover what's the most difficult aspect
of<00:00:44.739> it<00:00:44.859> um<00:00:45.659> sometimes<00:00:46.659> guys<00:00:46.839> are<00:00:47.050> hit<00:00:47.140> too<00:00:47.289> hard

00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:47.469 
of it um sometimes guys are hit too hard

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:48.720 
of it um sometimes guys are hit too hard
they<00:00:47.679> think<00:00:47.890> that's<00:00:48.010> got<00:00:48.219> to<00:00:48.309> be<00:00:48.370> really<00:00:48.579> loud

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
they think that's got to be really loud

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.340 
they think that's got to be really loud
so<00:00:48.789> when<00:00:49.120> they<00:00:49.210> clap<00:00:49.510> down<00:00:49.690> really<00:00:49.899> hard<00:00:49.989> they

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
so when they clap down really hard they

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.549 
so when they clap down really hard they
get<00:00:50.499> notes<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:52.030> that's<00:00:52.210> not<00:00:52.629> good<00:00:52.960> the<00:00:53.409> other

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
get notes and that's not good the other

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.279 
get notes and that's not good the other
time<00:00:53.829> you<00:00:54.039> you<00:00:54.249> clack<00:00:54.489> to<00:00:54.850> light<00:00:55.269> and<00:00:55.600> you

00:00:56.279 --> 00:00:56.289 
time you you clack to light and you

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:57.809 
time you you clack to light and you
sometimes<00:00:56.649> get<00:00:56.800> like<00:00:56.979> a<00:00:57.010> harmonic<00:00:57.640> or<00:00:57.789> a

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:57.819 
sometimes get like a harmonic or a

00:00:57.819 --> 00:01:00.569 
sometimes get like a harmonic or a
sustained<00:00:58.420> ring<00:00:58.719> and<00:00:59.050> it's<00:01:00.010> so<00:01:00.190> hard<00:01:00.489> to

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
sustained ring and it's so hard to

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.180 
sustained ring and it's so hard to
communicate<00:01:00.850> this<00:01:01.179> via<00:01:01.420> a<00:01:01.569> video<00:01:02.469> camera<00:01:02.889> but

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
communicate this via a video camera but

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.310 
communicate this via a video camera but
you<00:01:03.969> got<00:01:04.150> to<00:01:04.180> find<00:01:04.449> that<00:01:04.540> middle<00:01:04.780> point<00:01:05.019> of

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
you got to find that middle point of

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.859 
you got to find that middle point of
enough<00:01:05.680> enough<00:01:06.280> pressure<00:01:06.640> to<00:01:06.939> get<00:01:07.479> a<00:01:07.540> clunk

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
enough enough pressure to get a clunk

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:10.050 
enough enough pressure to get a clunk
but<00:01:08.380> not<00:01:08.920> hitting<00:01:09.369> it<00:01:09.430> and<00:01:09.520> getting<00:01:09.700> off<00:01:09.850> where

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
but not hitting it and getting off where

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.330 
but not hitting it and getting off where
you<00:01:10.149> get<00:01:10.299> you<00:01:10.810> know<00:01:10.869> you're<00:01:11.590> not<00:01:11.710> striking<00:01:12.219> and

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
you get you know you're not striking and

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.440 
you get you know you're not striking and
pulling<00:01:12.549> your<00:01:12.610> fingers<00:01:12.909> off<00:01:13.060> because<00:01:13.270> that's

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
pulling your fingers off because that's

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.469 
pulling your fingers off because that's
just<00:01:13.600> going<00:01:13.750> to<00:01:13.840> make<00:01:13.899> a<00:01:14.020> muddled<00:01:14.860> mess<00:01:15.100> um

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
just going to make a muddled mess um

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.870 
just going to make a muddled mess um
there<00:01:16.479> is<00:01:16.630> one<00:01:16.960> adjustment<00:01:17.590> that<00:01:17.920> I<00:01:17.950> made<00:01:18.430> when

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
there is one adjustment that I made when

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.880 
there is one adjustment that I made when
I<00:01:18.909> started<00:01:19.329> doing<00:01:19.479> it<00:01:19.719> that<00:01:19.899> might<00:01:20.350> help<00:01:20.619> and

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
I started doing it that might help and

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.109 
I started doing it that might help and
I'm<00:01:20.950> a<00:01:20.979> turn<00:01:21.280> a<00:01:21.310> little<00:01:21.460> bit<00:01:21.610> so<00:01:21.759> you<00:01:21.820> can<00:01:21.880> kind

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
I'm a turn a little bit so you can kind

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.450 
I'm a turn a little bit so you can kind
of<00:01:22.149> see<00:01:22.210> my<00:01:22.390> finger<00:01:22.659> board<00:01:22.840> better<00:01:23.020> I<00:01:23.340> like<00:01:24.340> to

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
of see my finger board better I like to

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.850 
of see my finger board better I like to
leave<00:01:24.640> my<00:01:24.670> index<00:01:25.210> finger<00:01:25.270> down<00:01:25.719> covering<00:01:26.649> the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
leave my index finger down covering the

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.060 
leave my index finger down covering the
ad<00:01:27.460> and<00:01:27.610> g-string<00:01:28.170> now<00:01:29.170> on<00:01:29.289> a<00:01:29.320> five<00:01:29.560> string<00:01:29.829> it

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
ad and g-string now on a five string it

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.349 
ad and g-string now on a five string it
would<00:01:30.189> be<00:01:30.340> similar<00:01:30.640> you<00:01:30.850> might<00:01:31.000> want<00:01:31.180> to<00:01:31.240> cover

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:31.359 
would be similar you might want to cover

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:33.840 
would be similar you might want to cover
the<00:01:31.539> first<00:01:31.750> four<00:01:31.960> string<00:01:32.200> and<00:01:32.320> and<00:01:33.219> I<00:01:33.609> leave<00:01:33.820> it

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
the first four string and and I leave it

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.120 
the first four string and and I leave it
down<00:01:34.180> and<00:01:34.450> I<00:01:34.509> really<00:01:34.869> clap<00:01:35.109> these<00:01:35.380> now<00:01:35.890> what

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
down and I really clap these now what

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.219 
down and I really clap these now what
that<00:01:36.159> does<00:01:36.549> is<00:01:36.579> that<00:01:37.060> mutes<00:01:37.359> these<00:01:37.630> top<00:01:37.899> three

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
that does is that mutes these top three

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:39.630 
that does is that mutes these top three
strings<00:01:38.560> so<00:01:38.770> that<00:01:38.920> there's<00:01:39.100> no<00:01:39.159> chance<00:01:39.460> of

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
strings so that there's no chance of

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.999 
strings so that there's no chance of
harmonic<00:01:40.149> or<00:01:40.329> sympathetic<00:01:41.229> vibrations<00:01:41.829> going

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
harmonic or sympathetic vibrations going

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:43.709 
harmonic or sympathetic vibrations going
to<00:01:42.070> get<00:01:42.189> through<00:01:42.340> the<00:01:42.939> reason<00:01:43.240> I<00:01:43.299> don't<00:01:43.479> do<00:01:43.600> it

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:43.719 
to get through the reason I don't do it

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:45.810 
to get through the reason I don't do it
across<00:01:43.899> all<00:01:44.229> of<00:01:44.259> them<00:01:44.590> is<00:01:44.740> because<00:01:45.039> a<00:01:45.549> lot<00:01:45.789> of

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
across all of them is because a lot of

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.419 
across all of them is because a lot of
my<00:01:45.969> grooves<00:01:46.270> I<00:01:46.450> use<00:01:46.600> an<00:01:46.750> open<00:01:47.049> E<00:01:47.259> and<00:01:47.530> so<00:01:47.979> being

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
my grooves I use an open E and so being

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:50.130 
my grooves I use an open E and so being
able<00:01:48.609> to<00:01:48.880> kind<00:01:49.179> of<00:01:49.210> just<00:01:49.390> lift<00:01:49.630> these<00:01:49.780> fingers

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
able to kind of just lift these fingers

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.870 
able to kind of just lift these fingers
and<00:01:50.320> get<00:01:50.619> that<00:01:50.740> opening<00:01:51.159> and<00:01:51.399> then<00:01:51.460> close<00:01:51.700> the

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
and get that opening and then close the

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.130 
and get that opening and then close the
door<00:01:52.090> is<00:01:52.329> pretty<00:01:53.280> advantageous<00:01:54.280> to<00:01:54.579> my<00:01:54.700> style

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
door is pretty advantageous to my style

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.830 
door is pretty advantageous to my style
but<00:01:56.140> by<00:01:56.289> leaving<00:01:56.500> one<00:01:56.649> finger<00:01:56.950> down

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
but by leaving one finger down

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.149 
but by leaving one finger down
it's<00:01:59.840> pretty<00:02:00.049> much<00:02:00.110> easier<00:02:00.560> to<00:02:00.740> get<00:02:00.860> a<00:02:00.920> good

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
it's pretty much easier to get a good

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.580 
it's pretty much easier to get a good
loud<00:02:01.430> click<00:02:01.820> without<00:02:02.270> either<00:02:02.479> getting<00:02:02.780> a<00:02:03.049> note

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
loud click without either getting a note

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.649 
loud click without either getting a note
or<00:02:03.860> any<00:02:04.399> kind<00:02:04.579> of<00:02:04.700> resonance<00:02:05.119> that<00:02:05.390> kind<00:02:05.600> of

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
or any kind of resonance that kind of

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.510 
or any kind of resonance that kind of
models<00:02:05.960> up<00:02:06.110> the<00:02:06.229> group<00:02:06.439> now<00:02:07.280> when<00:02:07.460> you

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
models up the group now when you

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.509 
models up the group now when you
practice<00:02:07.939> alone<00:02:08.209> at<00:02:08.720> home<00:02:08.869> alone<00:02:09.709> just<00:02:10.099> kind

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
practice alone at home alone just kind

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.570 
practice alone at home alone just kind
of<00:02:11.230> isolate<00:02:12.230> just<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.620> left<00:02:12.830> hand<00:02:13.069> and<00:02:13.280> just

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
of isolate just the left hand and just

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.940 
of isolate just the left hand and just
kind<00:02:14.120> of<00:02:14.180> get<00:02:14.300> a<00:02:14.330> clunk<00:02:14.660> and<00:02:14.840> and<00:02:15.500> you<00:02:15.709> have<00:02:15.860> to

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
kind of get a clunk and and you have to

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.339 
kind of get a clunk and and you have to
be<00:02:15.980> really<00:02:16.550> attentive<00:02:17.269> to<00:02:17.750> how<00:02:17.959> much<00:02:18.050> pressure

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
be really attentive to how much pressure

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.610 
be really attentive to how much pressure
using<00:02:18.830> so<00:02:19.310> if<00:02:19.610> it's<00:02:19.790> to<00:02:19.970> lie<00:02:20.200> you're<00:02:21.200> not<00:02:21.410> loud

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
using so if it's to lie you're not loud

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.740 
using so if it's to lie you're not loud
enough<00:02:21.650> to<00:02:21.890> are<00:02:22.489> you<00:02:23.120> want<00:02:23.300> to<00:02:23.360> kind<00:02:23.480> of<00:02:23.569> just

enough to are you want to kind of just

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.660 
enough to are you want to kind of just
find<00:02:24.019> that<00:02:24.230> one<00:02:24.470> yeah<00:02:25.459> that'll<00:02:26.060> sound<00:02:26.209> good

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
find that one yeah that'll sound good

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.650 
find that one yeah that'll sound good
you<00:02:28.670> want<00:02:28.880> to<00:02:28.940> really<00:02:29.090> just<00:02:29.300> sounded<00:02:29.510> like<00:02:29.540> a

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
you want to really just sounded like a

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.000 
you want to really just sounded like a
car<00:02:29.989> door<00:02:30.200> closing<00:02:31.299> you<00:02:32.299> know<00:02:32.360> and<00:02:32.630> then<00:02:33.500> work

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
car door closing you know and then work

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.170 
car door closing you know and then work
in<00:02:34.190> just<00:02:34.430> that<00:02:34.519> opening<00:02:34.970> I<00:02:35.030> talked<00:02:35.299> about<00:02:37.180> now

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
in just that opening I talked about now

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.300 
in just that opening I talked about now
why<00:02:38.420> I<00:02:38.450> say<00:02:38.780> open<00:02:39.110> it<00:02:39.230> we<00:02:39.530> add<00:02:39.650> in<00:02:39.860> the<00:02:39.980> open<00:02:40.220> E

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
why I say open it we add in the open E

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.190 
why I say open it we add in the open E
is<00:02:40.370> then<00:02:40.819> you<00:02:40.910> want<00:02:41.060> to<00:02:41.150> gauge<00:02:41.330> your<00:02:41.599> volume

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
is then you want to gauge your volume

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.410 
is then you want to gauge your volume
with<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:42.769> volume<00:02:43.040> and<00:02:43.130> open<00:02:43.549> thumb<00:02:43.880> note<00:02:44.150> make

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
with the volume and open thumb note make

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.059 
with the volume and open thumb note make
sure<00:02:44.599> that<00:02:44.810> you<00:02:45.019> can<00:02:45.200> hear<00:02:45.470> because<00:02:45.769> the<00:02:45.890> worst

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
sure that you can hear because the worst

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:47.800 
sure that you can hear because the worst
part<00:02:46.310> is<00:02:46.489> if<00:02:46.670> it's<00:02:46.819> like<00:02:46.970> you<00:02:47.150> play<00:02:47.360> and<00:02:47.750> that's

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
part is if it's like you play and that's

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.100 
part is if it's like you play and that's
really<00:02:48.049> quiet<00:02:49.540> say<00:02:50.540> I'm<00:02:50.630> not<00:02:50.780> really<00:02:50.930> getting

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
really quiet say I'm not really getting

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.720 
really quiet say I'm not really getting
to<00:02:51.260> click<00:02:51.440> I'm<00:02:51.590> just<00:02:51.769> stopping<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.310> note<00:02:52.519> you

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
to click I'm just stopping the note you

00:02:52.730 --> 00:03:01.089 
to click I'm just stopping the note you
want<00:02:53.569> to<00:02:53.630> get<00:02:53.780> a<00:02:54.019> percussive<00:02:54.440> clunk<00:02:59.739> so<00:03:00.739> be

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
want to get a percussive clunk so be

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:03.069 
want to get a percussive clunk so be
patient<00:03:01.340> with<00:03:01.670> yourself<00:03:01.760> I<00:03:02.269> select<00:03:02.930> that

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
patient with yourself I select that

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:04.059 
patient with yourself I select that
technique<00:03:03.470> if<00:03:03.650> it's<00:03:03.799> something<00:03:03.950> you're

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
technique if it's something you're

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.370 
technique if it's something you're
interested<00:03:04.280> in<00:03:04.609> and<00:03:04.819> just<00:03:05.510> be<00:03:05.720> real<00:03:05.989> attentive

interested in and just be real attentive
to<00:03:06.620> how<00:03:06.859> much<00:03:07.010> pressure<00:03:07.280> and<00:03:07.730> when<00:03:08.060> you<00:03:08.150> get<00:03:08.299> a

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
to how much pressure and when you get a

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:09.880 
to how much pressure and when you get a
good<00:03:08.569> sound<00:03:08.720> and<00:03:08.930> one<00:03:09.019> try<00:03:09.170> to<00:03:09.230> just<00:03:09.500> mirror

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
good sound and one try to just mirror

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.170 
good sound and one try to just mirror
that<00:03:10.100> and<00:03:10.250> try<00:03:10.370> to<00:03:10.430> get<00:03:10.579> that<00:03:10.670> muscle<00:03:10.940> memory

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
that and try to get that muscle memory

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.979 
that and try to get that muscle memory
down<00:03:11.590> with<00:03:12.590> just<00:03:12.859> an<00:03:13.010> afternoon<00:03:13.819> of<00:03:14.000> kind<00:03:14.930> of

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
down with just an afternoon of kind of

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.080 
down with just an afternoon of kind of
being<00:03:15.170> you<00:03:15.769> know<00:03:15.859> aware<00:03:16.340> what<00:03:16.609> you're<00:03:16.760> doing

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
being you know aware what you're doing

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.789 
being you know aware what you're doing
and<00:03:17.269> isolating<00:03:17.900> the<00:03:17.989> drill<00:03:18.230> then<00:03:18.530> you<00:03:18.680> should

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
and isolating the drill then you should

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.110 
and isolating the drill then you should
probably<00:03:18.859> will<00:03:19.370> have<00:03:19.489> it<00:03:19.609> down<00:03:19.730> for<00:03:19.910> the<00:03:19.940> rest

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
probably will have it down for the rest

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.580 
probably will have it down for the rest
your<00:03:20.180> life<00:03:20.299> at<00:03:20.660> least<00:03:20.780> that's<00:03:20.989> that's<00:03:21.319> how<00:03:21.470> it

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
your life at least that's that's how it

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.920 
your life at least that's that's how it
happened<00:03:21.950> for<00:03:22.130> me<00:03:22.250> and<00:03:22.459> believe<00:03:22.970> me<00:03:23.090> I<00:03:23.120> sucked

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
happened for me and believe me I sucked

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.809 
happened for me and believe me I sucked
at<00:03:24.170> first<00:03:24.470> I<00:03:24.709> mean<00:03:24.889> I<00:03:24.920> was<00:03:25.069> the<00:03:25.190> worst<00:03:25.400> at<00:03:25.639> left

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
at first I mean I was the worst at left

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.030 
at first I mean I was the worst at left
hand<00:03:26.000> claps<00:03:26.209> but<00:03:26.930> once<00:03:27.290> you<00:03:27.410> kind<00:03:27.590> of<00:03:27.739> get<00:03:27.859> that

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
hand claps but once you kind of get that

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.590 
hand claps but once you kind of get that
zone<00:03:28.310> where<00:03:28.340> you<00:03:28.670> get<00:03:28.819> that<00:03:28.850> pressure<00:03:29.209> and<00:03:29.540> you

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
zone where you get that pressure and you
