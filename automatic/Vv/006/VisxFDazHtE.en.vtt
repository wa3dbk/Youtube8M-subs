that me Oh Lee duck ok back to the

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.919 
that me Oh Lee duck ok back to the
particle<00:01:56.770> accelerator<00:01:57.179> you<00:01:58.179> simply<00:01:58.659> push

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
particle accelerator you simply push

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:01.469 
particle accelerator you simply push
something<00:01:59.289> in<00:01:59.619> this<00:01:59.770> end<00:02:00.069> and<00:02:00.280> it<00:02:01.030> comes<00:02:01.329> out

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
something in this end and it comes out

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.039 
something in this end and it comes out
the<00:02:01.689> upward<00:02:01.959> AB<00:02:02.229> maximum<00:02:03.069> velocity<00:02:04.049> resembles

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049
