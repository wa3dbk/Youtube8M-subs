00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
it has it has a pump and it'll pump that

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.420 
it has it has a pump and it'll pump that
that<00:02:31.790> nectar<00:02:32.300> up<00:02:32.510> out<00:02:32.750> of<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:33.080> flower<00:02:33.430> the

that nectar up out of the flower the

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.780 
that nectar up out of the flower the
hummingbird

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
hummingbird

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.190 
hummingbird
are<00:02:36.209> there<00:02:36.480> some<00:02:36.629> of<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.810> most<00:02:36.959> colorful

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
are there some of the most colorful

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.940 
are there some of the most colorful
birds<00:02:37.860> that<00:02:38.250> we<00:02:38.400> have<00:02:38.610> and<00:02:39.650> their<00:02:40.650> color

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
birds that we have and their color

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.580 
birds that we have and their color
though<00:02:41.250> doesn't<00:02:41.939> come<00:02:42.090> from<00:02:42.269> pigment<00:02:42.780> that

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
though doesn't come from pigment that

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.059 
though doesn't come from pigment that
God<00:02:44.400> has<00:02:44.670> made<00:02:44.939> the<00:02:45.180> hummingbird<00:02:45.719> with<00:02:47.629> like<00:02:48.629> a

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
God has made the hummingbird with like a

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.699 
God has made the hummingbird with like a
scaly<00:02:50.069> type<00:02:50.519> formation<00:02:51.180> of<00:02:51.359> its<00:02:51.540> feathers<00:02:51.959> so

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
scaly type formation of its feathers so

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.679 
scaly type formation of its feathers so
that<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.129> light<00:02:53.340> is<00:02:53.640> refracted<00:02:54.120> and

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:54.689 
that the light is refracted and

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:57.890 
that the light is refracted and
reflected<00:02:55.530> through<00:02:56.400> that<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:56.970> outcomes<00:02:57.689> all

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
reflected through that and outcomes all

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.530 
reflected through that and outcomes all
these<00:02:58.049> colors<00:02:58.260> so<00:02:58.560> maybe<00:02:59.250> at<00:02:59.549> night<00:02:59.579> you<00:03:00.420> would

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
these colors so maybe at night you would

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.789 
these colors so maybe at night you would
look<00:03:00.629> at<00:03:00.750> a<00:03:00.810> hummingbird<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:01.409> it<00:03:01.500> would<00:03:01.590> kind

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
look at a hummingbird and it would kind

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.220 
look at a hummingbird and it would kind
of<00:03:01.829> be<00:03:01.950> just<00:03:02.189> drab<00:03:02.659> but<00:03:03.659> that<00:03:03.810> you<00:03:03.930> get<00:03:04.109> the

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
of be just drab but that you get the

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.050 
of be just drab but that you get the
daylight<00:03:04.709> and<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:05.010> light<00:03:05.189> shining<00:03:05.549> on<00:03:05.730> it<00:03:05.790> and

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
daylight and the light shining on it and

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.470 
daylight and the light shining on it and
all<00:03:06.239> these<00:03:06.510> brilliant<00:03:06.870> colors<00:03:07.439> come<00:03:07.680> out

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
all these brilliant colors come out

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.940 
all these brilliant colors come out
another<00:03:09.480> thing<00:03:09.689> about<00:03:09.810> them<00:03:10.079> at<00:03:10.200> night<00:03:10.230> their

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
another thing about them at night their

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.129 
another thing about them at night their
little<00:03:11.340> metabolism<00:03:12.030> is<00:03:12.150> just<00:03:12.420> going<00:03:12.689> a<00:03:12.810> mile<00:03:13.109> a

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:13.139 
little metabolism is just going a mile a

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:14.750 
little metabolism is just going a mile a
minute<00:03:13.500> here<00:03:13.739> all<00:03:13.950> day<00:03:14.159> long<00:03:14.340> and<00:03:14.549> they<00:03:14.609> have

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
minute here all day long and they have

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.610 
minute here all day long and they have
to<00:03:14.879> eat<00:03:15.060> almost<00:03:15.419> constantly<00:03:16.019> all<00:03:16.230> day<00:03:16.260> long

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
to eat almost constantly all day long

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.860 
to eat almost constantly all day long
because<00:03:16.829> they<00:03:17.069> burn<00:03:17.280> so<00:03:17.489> much<00:03:17.669> energy<00:03:17.879> but

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
because they burn so much energy but

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.509 
because they burn so much energy but
then<00:03:19.049> at<00:03:19.200> night<00:03:19.439> when<00:03:19.680> they<00:03:19.769> go<00:03:19.889> to<00:03:19.950> sleep<00:03:20.159> if

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
then at night when they go to sleep if

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.670 
then at night when they go to sleep if
they<00:03:21.269> didn't<00:03:21.659> go<00:03:21.780> into<00:03:21.930> this<00:03:22.109> condition

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
they didn't go into this condition

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.860 
they didn't go into this condition
that's<00:03:22.829> called<00:03:23.099> torpor<00:03:23.609> which<00:03:23.879> slows<00:03:24.450> their

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
that's called torpor which slows their

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.679 
that's called torpor which slows their
metabolism<00:03:24.900> down<00:03:25.829> slows<00:03:26.790> their<00:03:27.150> heart<00:03:27.450> rate

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:27.689 
metabolism down slows their heart rate

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:30.849 
metabolism down slows their heart rate
way<00:03:28.109> down<00:03:28.639> slows<00:03:29.639> their<00:03:29.909> body<00:03:30.150> temperature

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
way down slows their body temperature

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:33.589 
way down slows their body temperature
cools<00:03:31.859> down<00:03:32.189> their<00:03:32.430> body<00:03:32.639> temperature<00:03:33.209> so

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
cools down their body temperature so

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.649 
cools down their body temperature so
that<00:03:33.629> they're<00:03:33.900> only<00:03:34.109> a<00:03:34.230> couple<00:03:34.470> degrees<00:03:34.739> above

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:35.659 
that they're only a couple degrees above

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:38.000 
that they're only a couple degrees above
outside<00:03:36.659> temperature<00:03:36.989> whatever<00:03:37.439> it<00:03:37.590> is<00:03:37.739> and

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
outside temperature whatever it is and

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.280 
outside temperature whatever it is and
then<00:03:38.549> they<00:03:38.730> sleep<00:03:39.060> that<00:03:39.299> way<00:03:39.480> well<00:03:40.169> then

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
then they sleep that way well then

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.229 
then they sleep that way well then
they're<00:03:40.440> not<00:03:40.560> burning<00:03:40.799> a<00:03:41.159> lot<00:03:41.639> of<00:03:41.819> energy<00:03:41.970> at

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
they're not burning a lot of energy at

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.330 
they're not burning a lot of energy at
night<00:03:42.299> because<00:03:42.629> most<00:03:43.260> flowers<00:03:43.530> close<00:03:44.040> up<00:03:44.220> at

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
night because most flowers close up at

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.979 
night because most flowers close up at
night<00:03:44.549> and<00:03:44.849> there<00:03:45.239> and<00:03:45.419> they<00:03:45.569> just<00:03:45.720> don't<00:03:45.930> go

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
night and there and they just don't go

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.930 
night and there and they just don't go
looking<00:03:46.260> for<00:03:46.409> flowers<00:03:46.560> at<00:03:46.829> night<00:03:46.979> anyway<00:03:47.370> but

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
looking for flowers at night anyway but

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.920 
looking for flowers at night anyway but
if<00:03:48.090> they<00:03:48.269> didn't<00:03:48.690> have<00:03:48.959> this<00:03:49.260> particular<00:03:50.930> way

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
if they didn't have this particular way

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.890 
if they didn't have this particular way
of<00:03:52.319> protecting<00:03:52.949> themselves<00:03:53.280> at<00:03:53.729> night<00:03:53.940> they

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
of protecting themselves at night they

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.689 
of protecting themselves at night they
would<00:03:55.169> they<00:03:55.379> would<00:03:55.409> they<00:03:56.040> would<00:03:56.069> like<00:03:56.340> starve

would they would they would like starve
to<00:03:56.940> death<00:03:56.970> overnight<00:03:57.599> because<00:03:57.959> of<00:03:58.079> this<00:03:58.169> rapid

flowers<00:04:05.159> as<00:04:05.400> the<00:04:05.760> flowers<00:04:06.120> are<00:04:06.269> blooming<00:04:06.479> and

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
flowers as the flowers are blooming and

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.539 
flowers as the flowers are blooming and
then<00:04:07.019> they're<00:04:07.500> going<00:04:07.530> farther<00:04:08.010> north<00:04:08.370> each

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
then they're going farther north each

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.099 
then they're going farther north each
year<00:04:08.790> the<00:04:08.909> hummingbirds<00:04:09.359> go<00:04:09.569> right<00:04:09.780> with<00:04:09.930> the

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
year the hummingbirds go right with the

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:13.460 
year the hummingbirds go right with the
flowers<00:04:10.500> some<00:04:11.239> hummingbirds<00:04:12.239> will<00:04:12.540> go<00:04:13.139> and

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
flowers some hummingbirds will go and

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.559 
flowers some hummingbirds will go and
fly<00:04:13.949> all<00:04:14.340> the<00:04:14.669> way<00:04:14.699> across<00:04:14.879> the<00:04:15.120> Gulf<00:04:15.449> of

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
fly all the way across the Gulf of

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.589 
fly all the way across the Gulf of
Mexico<00:04:16.049> what's<00:04:16.709> like<00:04:16.859> 500<00:04:17.400> miles<00:04:17.609> you<00:04:18.359> have<00:04:18.570> a

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:18.599 
Mexico what's like 500 miles you have a

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:21.800 
Mexico what's like 500 miles you have a
little<00:04:18.900> two<00:04:19.229> or<00:04:19.530> three<00:04:19.889> inch<00:04:20.130> long<00:04:20.489> bird<00:04:21.000> that

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
little two or three inch long bird that

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.399 
little two or three inch long bird that
normally<00:04:22.409> is<00:04:22.590> eating<00:04:23.159> all<00:04:23.370> day<00:04:23.449> every<00:04:24.449> day<00:04:24.479> and

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:25.409 
normally is eating all day every day and

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:27.260 
normally is eating all day every day and
now<00:04:25.650> all<00:04:25.770> of<00:04:25.860> a<00:04:25.949> sudden<00:04:26.280> it<00:04:26.430> takes<00:04:26.729> off<00:04:27.000> and

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
now all of a sudden it takes off and

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.080 
now all of a sudden it takes off and
it's<00:04:27.870> going<00:04:27.990> to<00:04:28.050> fly<00:04:28.260> 500<00:04:28.590> miles<00:04:29.159> and<00:04:29.430> it<00:04:29.820> can't

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
it's going to fly 500 miles and it can't

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.230 
it's going to fly 500 miles and it can't
rest<00:04:30.419> it<00:04:30.720> can't<00:04:31.050> it<00:04:31.320> can't<00:04:31.650> land<00:04:32.220> it's<00:04:33.030> going

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
rest it can't it can't land it's going

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.950 
rest it can't it can't land it's going
to<00:04:33.300> fly<00:04:33.479> that<00:04:33.690> whole<00:04:33.900> distance

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
to fly that whole distance

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.800 
to fly that whole distance
well<00:04:35.319> how<00:04:35.440> does<00:04:35.500> it<00:04:35.770> do<00:04:35.919> that<00:04:35.979> well<00:04:36.940> I<00:04:37.240> haven't

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
well how does it do that well I haven't

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.330 
well how does it do that well I haven't
been<00:04:37.900> able<00:04:38.020> to<00:04:38.169> find<00:04:38.350> any<00:04:38.560> researchers<00:04:39.160> that

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
been able to find any researchers that

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.010 
been able to find any researchers that
really<00:04:39.610> know<00:04:39.789> how<00:04:40.060> it<00:04:40.240> does<00:04:40.449> that<00:04:40.509> there's

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
really know how it does that there's

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.870 
really know how it does that there's
different<00:04:41.440> theories<00:04:41.830> about<00:04:42.069> that<00:04:42.340> I<00:04:42.550> think

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
different theories about that I think

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.760 
different theories about that I think
this<00:04:43.180> is<00:04:43.330> another<00:04:43.569> area<00:04:43.660> we<00:04:44.139> could<00:04:44.289> use<00:04:44.560> some

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
this is another area we could use some

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.770 
this is another area we could use some
young<00:04:44.949> people<00:04:45.130> to<00:04:45.430> let's<00:04:46.060> figure<00:04:46.360> this<00:04:46.539> out

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
young people to let's figure this out

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.770 
young people to let's figure this out
how<00:04:47.590> does<00:04:47.800> it<00:04:47.949> something<00:04:48.639> that<00:04:48.970> burns<00:04:49.270> energy

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
how does it something that burns energy

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.969 
how does it something that burns energy
rapidly<00:04:50.680> then<00:04:51.430> with<00:04:51.960> still<00:04:52.960> using<00:04:53.620> a<00:04:53.710> lot<00:04:53.860> of

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979 
rapidly then with still using a lot of

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:56.700 
rapidly then with still using a lot of
energy<00:04:54.419> conserve<00:04:55.419> energy<00:04:55.930> as<00:04:56.080> it's<00:04:56.470> fine

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
energy conserve energy as it's fine

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.939 
energy conserve energy as it's fine
across<00:04:57.639> the<00:04:57.819> Gulf<00:04:57.970> of<00:04:58.060> Mexico<00:04:58.509> and<00:04:58.750> so<00:04:59.710> there's

00:04:59.939 --> 00:04:59.949 
across the Gulf of Mexico and so there's

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:02.010 
across the Gulf of Mexico and so there's
some<00:05:00.520> mysteries<00:05:01.090> here<00:05:01.210> built<00:05:01.509> into<00:05:01.930> the

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
some mysteries here built into the

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.070 
some mysteries here built into the
hummingbird<00:05:02.500> to<00:05:02.770> that<00:05:03.250> I<00:05:03.280> think<00:05:03.599> deserve<00:05:04.599> some

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
hummingbird to that I think deserve some

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.080 
hummingbird to that I think deserve some
of<00:05:05.110> us<00:05:05.319> to<00:05:05.440> take<00:05:05.590> a<00:05:05.620> look<00:05:05.770> at<00:05:05.949> of<00:05:06.580> course<00:05:06.789> a

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
of us to take a look at of course a

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.390 
of us to take a look at of course a
hummingbird<00:05:07.660> is<00:05:07.780> so<00:05:07.900> tiny<00:05:08.229> that<00:05:08.560> they<00:05:09.099> make<00:05:09.370> a

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
hummingbird is so tiny that they make a

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.790 
hummingbird is so tiny that they make a
tiny<00:05:09.729> nest<00:05:10.090> and<00:05:10.389> they<00:05:10.599> can<00:05:10.750> make<00:05:10.900> a<00:05:10.930> nest<00:05:11.199> in<00:05:11.440> a

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
tiny nest and they can make a nest in a

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.420 
tiny nest and they can make a nest in a
matter<00:05:11.979> of<00:05:12.099> hours<00:05:13.080> sometimes<00:05:14.080> they<00:05:14.229> do<00:05:14.430> but

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
matter of hours sometimes they do but

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.010 
matter of hours sometimes they do but
usually<00:05:15.759> they'll<00:05:15.910> work<00:05:16.030> on<00:05:16.150> a<00:05:16.210> day<00:05:16.449> or<00:05:16.599> two<00:05:16.750> and

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
usually they'll work on a day or two and

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.020 
usually they'll work on a day or two and
they<00:05:17.770> make<00:05:17.919> the<00:05:18.070> nest<00:05:18.280> and<00:05:18.460> sometimes<00:05:18.880> the

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
they make the nest and sometimes the

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.879 
they make the nest and sometimes the
nest<00:05:19.240> is<00:05:19.419> it's<00:05:19.930> only<00:05:20.139> about<00:05:20.259> the<00:05:20.440> size<00:05:20.470> of<00:05:20.800> a

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:20.889 
nest is it's only about the size of a

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:24.300 
nest is it's only about the size of a
quarter<00:05:21.220> a<00:05:21.550> 25<00:05:22.479> cent<00:05:22.690> piece<00:05:22.930> the<00:05:23.560> eggs<00:05:23.770> about

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
quarter a 25 cent piece the eggs about

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.790 
quarter a 25 cent piece the eggs about
the<00:05:24.580> size<00:05:24.789> of<00:05:25.000> a<00:05:25.090> small<00:05:25.210> p<00:05:25.720> it<00:05:26.020> only<00:05:26.259> lays<00:05:26.500> two

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
the size of a small p it only lays two

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.110 
the size of a small p it only lays two
eggs<00:05:26.979> so<00:05:27.190> it'll<00:05:27.340> have<00:05:27.370> those<00:05:27.580> two<00:05:27.789> little<00:05:27.909> eggs

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
eggs so it'll have those two little eggs

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.020 
eggs so it'll have those two little eggs
but<00:05:29.080> it's<00:05:29.530> interesting<00:05:29.889> how<00:05:30.310> they<00:05:30.520> get<00:05:30.880> the

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
but it's interesting how they get the

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.210 
but it's interesting how they get the
material<00:05:31.539> to<00:05:31.690> make<00:05:31.870> their<00:05:32.139> nests<00:05:32.500> they'll<00:05:32.979> use

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.220 
material to make their nests they'll use

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.070 
material to make their nests they'll use
a<00:05:33.250> little<00:05:33.490> bits<00:05:33.639> of<00:05:33.729> grass<00:05:34.000> and<00:05:34.030> and<00:05:34.630> and

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
a little bits of grass and and and

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.589 
a little bits of grass and and and
sometimes<00:05:35.560> some<00:05:36.069> twigs<00:05:36.430> and<00:05:36.729> things<00:05:36.970> how<00:05:37.569> they

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:37.599 
sometimes some twigs and things how they

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:40.200 
sometimes some twigs and things how they
hold<00:05:38.050> it<00:05:38.139> all<00:05:38.289> together<00:05:38.759> they<00:05:39.759> go<00:05:39.940> and<00:05:40.120> get

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
hold it all together they go and get

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.770 
hold it all together they go and get
spider<00:05:40.570> webbing<00:05:40.840> and<00:05:41.080> then<00:05:41.979> different<00:05:42.940> kinds

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:43.780 
spider webbing and then different kinds

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.680 
spider webbing and then different kinds
of<00:05:43.870> hummingbirds<00:05:44.440> will<00:05:45.000> make<00:05:46.000> different

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690 
of hummingbirds will make different

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.810 
of hummingbirds will make different
varieties<00:05:47.380> of<00:05:47.409> nests<00:05:47.919> and<00:05:48.039> of<00:05:48.280> course<00:05:48.490> if<00:05:48.699> you

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
varieties of nests and of course if you

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.520 
varieties of nests and of course if you
know<00:05:49.030> how<00:05:49.210> many<00:05:49.360> birds<00:05:49.570> and<00:05:49.900> you<00:05:50.050> see<00:05:50.259> a<00:05:50.289> nest

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:50.530 
know how many birds and you see a nest

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:51.629 
know how many birds and you see a nest
then<00:05:50.800> you'll<00:05:50.949> know<00:05:51.130> well<00:05:51.310> that's<00:05:51.400> the

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:51.639 
then you'll know well that's the

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:53.550 
then you'll know well that's the
hummingbird<00:05:52.060> but<00:05:52.780> some<00:05:52.990> of<00:05:53.050> them<00:05:53.139> their<00:05:53.289> nests

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
hummingbird but some of them their nests

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.010 
hummingbird but some of them their nests
are<00:05:53.710> just<00:05:53.889> hanging<00:05:54.400> off<00:05:54.520> of<00:05:54.580> limbs<00:05:55.449> little

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
are just hanging off of limbs little

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.499 
are just hanging off of limbs little
twigs<00:05:56.380> and<00:05:56.590> things<00:05:56.770> and<00:05:56.949> it's<00:05:57.729> not<00:05:57.969> balanced

00:05:58.499 --> 00:05:58.509 
twigs and things and it's not balanced

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:00.360 
twigs and things and it's not balanced
right<00:05:58.659> so<00:05:59.320> they<00:05:59.469> will<00:05:59.620> go<00:05:59.800> and<00:06:00.009> they<00:06:00.099> will<00:06:00.219> pick

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
right so they will go and they will pick

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.550 
right so they will go and they will pick
up<00:06:00.490> little<00:06:00.669> pebbles<00:06:01.120> and<00:06:01.360> with<00:06:02.229> spider

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
up little pebbles and with spider

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.580 
up little pebbles and with spider
webbing<00:06:02.860> they'll<00:06:03.370> hang<00:06:03.729> pebbles<00:06:04.330> on<00:06:04.719> the<00:06:05.320> side

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:05.590 
webbing they'll hang pebbles on the side

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.950 
webbing they'll hang pebbles on the side
of<00:06:05.620> the<00:06:05.889> nest<00:06:06.159> to<00:06:06.669> balance<00:06:07.150> the<00:06:07.330> nest<00:06:07.570> so<00:06:07.810> that

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 
of the nest to balance the nest so that

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.140 
of the nest to balance the nest so that
when<00:06:08.110> then<00:06:08.289> when<00:06:08.710> the<00:06:08.979> bird<00:06:09.460> is<00:06:09.669> in<00:06:09.880> the<00:06:09.940> nest

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150 
when then when the bird is in the nest

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.310 
when then when the bird is in the nest
on<00:06:10.659> the<00:06:10.930> eggs<00:06:11.110> these<00:06:12.009> stones<00:06:12.520> act<00:06:13.419> as<00:06:13.719> as<00:06:13.990> a

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:14.320 
on the eggs these stones act as as a

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.820 
on the eggs these stones act as as a
balance<00:06:14.889> so<00:06:15.219> that<00:06:15.250> the<00:06:15.490> nest<00:06:15.759> hangs<00:06:16.300> a

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
balance so that the nest hangs a

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:20.939 
balance so that the nest hangs a
straighter<00:06:17.830> as<00:06:18.070> well<00:06:18.669> as<00:06:18.880> it<00:06:19.120> doesn't<00:06:19.740> rock<00:06:20.740> as

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:20.949 
straighter as well as it doesn't rock as

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:22.560 
straighter as well as it doesn't rock as
much<00:06:21.190> in<00:06:21.430> the<00:06:21.550> wind<00:06:21.729> because<00:06:22.150> of<00:06:22.300> the<00:06:22.389> weight

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:22.570 
much in the wind because of the weight

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.540 
much in the wind because of the weight
of<00:06:22.810> the<00:06:22.930> pebbles<00:06:23.259> hanging<00:06:23.560> on<00:06:23.680> why<00:06:24.250> would<00:06:24.520> a

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:24.550 
of the pebbles hanging on why would a

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.420 
of the pebbles hanging on why would a
how<00:06:25.389> could<00:06:25.690> how<00:06:25.990> big<00:06:26.320> could<00:06:26.800> the<00:06:26.919> brain<00:06:27.159> of<00:06:27.190> a

how could how big could the brain of a

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:28.310 
how could how big could the brain of a
hummingbird<00:06:27.610> be

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:28.320 
hummingbird be

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.650 
hummingbird be
you<00:06:28.590> know<00:06:28.650> this<00:06:28.830> little<00:06:29.070> tiny<00:06:29.520> creature<00:06:29.910> and

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:30.660 
you know this little tiny creature and

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.460 
you know this little tiny creature and
it<00:06:30.930> has<00:06:31.200> the<00:06:31.800> knowledge<00:06:32.550> to<00:06:33.450> build<00:06:33.840> a<00:06:34.140> nest

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:34.470 
it has the knowledge to build a nest

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:37.850 
it has the knowledge to build a nest
first<00:06:34.890> of<00:06:35.070> all<00:06:35.220> it<00:06:36.030> has<00:06:36.360> its<00:06:36.720> own<00:06:36.930> kind<00:06:37.260> of<00:06:37.590> nest

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860 
first of all it has its own kind of nest

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.980 
first of all it has its own kind of nest
that<00:06:38.190> it's<00:06:38.310> going<00:06:38.520> to<00:06:38.610> build<00:06:38.880> and<00:06:39.210> then<00:06:39.840> it

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:39.990 
that it's going to build and then it

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.340 
that it's going to build and then it
knows<00:06:40.140> how<00:06:40.200> to<00:06:40.470> balance<00:06:40.890> a<00:06:41.250> nest<00:06:41.580> by<00:06:42.420> certain

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:43.350 
knows how to balance a nest by certain

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.700 
knows how to balance a nest by certain
weights<00:06:43.680> that<00:06:44.220> it<00:06:44.370> cooks<00:06:44.640> in<00:06:44.880> in<00:06:45.330> there<00:06:45.900> that

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:46.710 
weights that it cooks in in there that

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:50.060 
weights that it cooks in in there that
that<00:06:47.040> seems<00:06:47.340> like<00:06:47.610> a<00:06:47.850> design<00:06:48.510> feature<00:06:49.070> that

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:50.070 
that seems like a design feature that

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.540 
that seems like a design feature that
would<00:06:50.340> require<00:06:50.900> information<00:06:51.950> put<00:06:52.950> in<00:06:53.250> there

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:53.550 
would require information put in there

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.970 
would require information put in there
so<00:06:54.180> that<00:06:54.210> it<00:06:54.420> knows<00:06:54.600> what<00:06:54.810> to<00:06:54.870> do<00:06:55.140> and<00:06:55.500> I

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:55.980 
so that it knows what to do and I

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:57.560 
so that it knows what to do and I
believe<00:06:56.220> our<00:06:56.340> Creator<00:06:56.730> is<00:06:56.940> the<00:06:57.090> one<00:06:57.240> that<00:06:57.360> does

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:57.570 
believe our Creator is the one that does

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:00.560 
believe our Creator is the one that does
that<00:06:57.780> with<00:06:57.990> the<00:06:58.140> hummingbird
