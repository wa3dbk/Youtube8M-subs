00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:18.660
 Good day to all I do not want to talk 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:25.170
 about insulation for you dad such 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:31.349
 pin finger is very thick with a thickness of only 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:34.680
 2 millimeters this penofol is desirable 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:38.340
 fits under the warm floor that is here 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:44.580
 the heating element itself as assured 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:45.860
 manufacturer specified shortens time 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.180
 heating up 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.940
 increases the heat transfer surface 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.940
 full 15 percent withstand the load 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:59.760
 200 kilograms environmentally friendly 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:03.330
 product that is this penofol he 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.810
 pushes the type up does not give 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:11.100
 pass down if you put this 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.740
 insulation for underfloor heating by itself 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.650
 heating element heating 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.440
 the element will heat accordingly 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.290
 tile well and cement screed which 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.990
 is above the surface of this 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.900
 thermal insulation that is heavy down in 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.810
 the depth that we do not need to warm up there 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.030
 floor slabs so reverend he 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.090
 warm something well or will 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.490
 warm up but very little then there is this 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:43.640
 film helps us save 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:48.150
 electricity let's say 20 percent 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:50.600
 point here to 15 percent well I think 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.220
 percent 20 120 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:57.840
 I advise you to take this dense 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.090
 the film and the walls are as thick as nothing 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.990
 then 2 3 millimeters 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:07.409
 there is a thicker thickness of 5 millimeters but 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.090
 she is very wrinkled if you put 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.120
 tile 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.599
 chances are that while the insulation is warm 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:20.129
 5 liter will play your tiles 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:24.000
 over time crack fuck us this is not 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:28.670
 it is necessary therefore take here so thin 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.640
 at night effective thermal insulation for the floor 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:36.090
 invest it elementary laid 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.230
 reflecting the country's laying up 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.099
 warm floor 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:43.760
 then pour it all over with tile glue and 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:47.910
 steamy top 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:51.380
 tile now I will put under the warm floor 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.380
 roots that turned out 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.210
 so I laid 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.060
 insulation for underfloor heating under 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:05.550
 sanction battle goal 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:08.210
 so it turned out to be exactly the zone 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.210
 heating 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:16.530
 here is a warm floor top 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:20.940
 heat insulation for all football shiny 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:31.520
 side made here such here in the slot 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:31.520
 here here here here to 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:39.720
 tile adhesive penetrated between 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:43.320
 heat insulation and tightened it 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:46.200
 let's say so if we put the total reservoir 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.740
 then the tile glue will just light 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.350
 over the top 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:52.850
 heat insulation will not be very 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:57.150
 okay he will play attack on 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:04:00.239
 Dubow is available as if grabbed together 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:04.590
 with cement screed and will be on the street 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:12.230
 firmly lie worth paying attention to 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:15.560
 temperature sensor temperature sensor lies with us 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:20.970
 thermal sensor i isolate 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:26.910
 the same thermal insulation only as it was 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:31.290
 that is, it lies in his yellow and yellow 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:39.630
 and the thermal sensor will not lose heat if 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:42.530
 its not to isolate that thermo dat itself 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.850
 temperature is faster than under floor heating and 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:50.550
 accordingly will turn on will be 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:54.479
 hordes here for a thermal sensor also 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:59.030
 cut to warm the floor here this 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:05:01.080
 the heating element was heating it 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:04.790
 let's say so that the warm floor is not 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:08.970
 overheated if not cut here 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:12.210
 hole for temperature sensor warm floor 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.640
 It will get so hot that 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:17.760
 temperature project passed to temperature 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:20.610
 that is, the warm floor will be much warmer 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.990
 that is, you are there for this example 30 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.690
 degrees and warm floor 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:27.120
 reaches 50 degrees only then 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:30.360
 the temperature will pass through warm 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:32.400
 insulating film having reached 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:35.310
 thermal sensors so for thermal sensor 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:38.370
 need to make your hole so he 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.090
 heated let's say so along with warm 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.080
 floor 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:45.780
 that is, the temperature is not different 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:52.620
 Here is such a heat insulation film 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:58.190
 what is god for pro top oh we pour 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:58.190
 tile glue and accordingly 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:05.030
 so everyone think you found a fashion blog
