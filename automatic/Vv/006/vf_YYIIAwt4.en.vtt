about three years ago by an optometrist

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.379 
about three years ago by an optometrist

whereby I first attending Specsavers yes
on<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.750> age<00:00:12.840> of<00:00:12.929> 18<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:14.030> that's<00:00:15.030> when<00:00:15.210> I

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
on the age of 18 and that's when I

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.460 
on the age of 18 and that's when I
realized<00:00:15.660> that<00:00:15.780> my<00:00:15.870> vision<00:00:16.170> was

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
realized that my vision was

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.160 
realized that my vision was
deteriorating<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:18.240> so<00:00:18.810> they've<00:00:18.930> tried

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
deteriorating and so they've tried

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.960 
deteriorating and so they've tried
various<00:00:19.740> lenses<00:00:20.520> for<00:00:21.180> me<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.630> that<00:00:22.529> failed

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
various lenses for me and that failed

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.890 
various lenses for me and that failed
and<00:00:23.970> they<00:00:24.060> say<00:00:24.210> there<00:00:24.359> wasn't<00:00:24.480> much<00:00:24.689> they

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
and they say there wasn't much they

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:25.490 
and they say there wasn't much they
could<00:00:24.930> do

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
could do

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.439 
could do
so<00:00:25.949> it's<00:00:26.070> fx8<00:00:26.550> was<00:00:26.699> referred<00:00:27.029> on<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.390> an

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
so it's fx8 was referred on to an

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.599 
so it's fx8 was referred on to an
optometrist<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.289> he<00:00:29.099> said<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.400> glasses

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
optometrist and he said the glasses

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.790 
optometrist and he said the glasses
aren't<00:00:30.000> going<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.179> be<00:00:30.269> enough<00:00:30.330> for<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:30.720> so<00:00:30.929> and

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
aren't going to be enough for you so and

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.080 
aren't going to be enough for you so and
I<00:00:32.040> think<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:32.550> you've<00:00:32.640> got<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.850> condition

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
I think that you've got a condition

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.569 
I think that you've got a condition
called<00:00:33.420> character<00:00:33.780> codes<00:00:33.989> I'm<00:00:34.140> not<00:00:34.260> sure<00:00:34.579> and

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
called character codes I'm not sure and

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.490 
called character codes I'm not sure and
that's<00:00:35.850> getting<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.360> bit<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:36.750> that's<00:00:36.960> when<00:00:37.230> that

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
that's getting a bit so that's when that

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.350 
that's getting a bit so that's when that
was<00:00:37.620> about<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.040> time<00:00:38.070> they<00:00:38.520> considered<00:00:39.270> it

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
was about the time they considered it

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.180 
was about the time they considered it
but<00:00:39.629> it<00:00:39.750> wasn't<00:00:39.960> certain<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:40.980> was<00:00:41.100> about

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
but it wasn't certain so it was about

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.869 
but it wasn't certain so it was about
three<00:00:41.460> years<00:00:41.550> ago<00:00:41.840> okay<00:00:43.040> but<00:00:44.040> they<00:00:44.219> found<00:00:44.610> out

that<00:03:42.400> I<00:03:42.459> realized<00:03:42.730> how<00:03:43.060> much<00:03:43.540> my<00:03:43.959> life

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
that I realized how much my life

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.319 
that I realized how much my life
depended<00:03:44.709> on<00:03:44.799> my<00:03:44.950> vision<00:03:45.160> and<00:03:45.609> everything

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
depended on my vision and everything

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:48.300 
depended on my vision and everything
came<00:03:46.480> to<00:03:46.630> standstill<00:03:47.019> because<00:03:47.590> I<00:03:47.950> realized

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
came to standstill because I realized

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.910 
came to standstill because I realized
how<00:03:48.459> much<00:03:48.609> I<00:03:48.760> was<00:03:48.850> depending<00:03:49.299> on<00:03:49.390> these

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
how much I was depending on these

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.460 
how much I was depending on these
peas<00:03:50.190> and<00:03:50.220> I<00:03:50.430> got<00:03:50.610> very<00:03:50.730> frustrated<00:03:51.420> so<00:03:52.410> I

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
peas and I got very frustrated so I

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.260 
peas and I got very frustrated so I
thought<00:03:52.680> now<00:03:52.920> the<00:03:53.520> kinds<00:03:53.790> of<00:03:53.880> time<00:03:54.090> I

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
thought now the kinds of time I

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.180 
thought now the kinds of time I
finishing<00:03:54.720> diversity<00:03:55.230> came<00:03:55.680> down<00:03:55.890> to<00:03:56.040> London

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
finishing diversity came down to London

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.370 
finishing diversity came down to London
I<00:03:56.760> said<00:03:56.940> enough<00:03:57.209> is<00:03:57.300> enough<00:03:57.360> I<00:03:57.900> want<00:03:58.230> to<00:03:58.319> get

I said enough is enough I want to get

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.850 
I said enough is enough I want to get
something<00:03:58.739> done<00:03:59.150> so<00:04:00.150> then<00:04:00.360> I<00:04:00.720> went<00:04:01.140> online<00:04:01.349> and

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
something done so then I went online and

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.559 
something done so then I went online and
I<00:04:02.010> typed<00:04:02.400> him<00:04:02.670> treatment<00:04:03.030> of<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.270> character

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
I typed him treatment of the character

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:04.850 
I typed him treatment of the character
comas<00:04:03.900> and<00:04:03.989> the<00:04:04.050> first<00:04:04.290> thing<00:04:04.470> that<00:04:04.500> came<00:04:04.830> up

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
comas and the first thing that came up

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.760 
comas and the first thing that came up
was<00:04:05.040> occupation<00:04:06.030> which<00:04:06.660> was<00:04:06.840> one<00:04:07.260> of<00:04:07.290> the<00:04:07.470> best

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
was occupation which was one of the best

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.699 
was occupation which was one of the best
in<00:04:07.890> the<00:04:07.950> world<00:04:09.020> in<00:04:10.020> treating<00:04:10.410> keratoconus

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
in the world in treating keratoconus

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.530 
in the world in treating keratoconus
because<00:04:11.370> obviously<00:04:11.520> it's<00:04:11.790> my<00:04:11.940> science<00:04:12.239> and<00:04:12.450> I

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
because obviously it's my science and I

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.570 
because obviously it's my science and I
didn't<00:04:12.750> want<00:04:12.900> to<00:04:12.959> go<00:04:13.080> to<00:04:13.140> any<00:04:13.770> old<00:04:13.980> backstreet

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
didn't want to go to any old backstreet

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.699 
didn't want to go to any old backstreet
and<00:04:14.819> I<00:04:15.030> realize<00:04:15.690> all<00:04:15.959> the<00:04:16.079> shortcomings<00:04:16.620> in

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
and I realize all the shortcomings in

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.090 
and I realize all the shortcomings in
the<00:04:16.739> NHS<00:04:17.340> didn't<00:04:18.000> really<00:04:18.239> offer<00:04:18.389> me<00:04:18.859> much<00:04:19.859> in

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
the NHS didn't really offer me much in

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.920 
the NHS didn't really offer me much in
turn<00:04:20.310> in<00:04:20.489> waves<00:04:20.700> of<00:04:20.880> options<00:04:21.299> of<00:04:21.660> how<00:04:21.780> they

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
turn in waves of options of how they

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.180 
turn in waves of options of how they
could<00:04:22.109> treat<00:04:22.260> me<00:04:22.470> and<00:04:22.620> I<00:04:22.650> needed<00:04:23.010> something

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
could treat me and I needed something

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.159 
could treat me and I needed something
done<00:04:23.550> there<00:04:23.850> and<00:04:23.970> then<00:04:24.320> so<00:04:25.320> I<00:04:25.979> read<00:04:26.790> a<00:04:27.169> few

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
done there and then so I read a few

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.140 
done there and then so I read a few
blogs<00:04:28.500> on<00:04:28.710> a<00:04:29.040> key<00:04:29.160> vision<00:04:29.580> and<00:04:29.820> I<00:04:29.850> looked<00:04:30.030> at

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
blogs on a key vision and I looked at

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.820 
blogs on a key vision and I looked at
the<00:04:30.240> website<00:04:30.690> which<00:04:31.050> was<00:04:31.169> very<00:04:31.350> informative

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
the website which was very informative

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.560 
the website which was very informative
and<00:04:32.540> then<00:04:33.540> I<00:04:33.660> ranked<00:04:34.169> a<00:04:34.440> key<00:04:34.710> vision<00:04:35.100> and<00:04:35.570> I

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
and then I ranked a key vision and I

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.200 
and then I ranked a key vision and I
could<00:04:37.080> tell<00:04:37.320> from<00:04:37.590> the<00:04:38.100> moment<00:04:38.340> that<00:04:38.610> that<00:04:39.000> I

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
could tell from the moment that that I

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.409 
could tell from the moment that that I
spoke<00:04:39.630> to<00:04:39.690> one<00:04:40.560> of<00:04:40.590> the<00:04:40.800> staff<00:04:41.240> but<00:04:42.240> they<00:04:42.360> were

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
it was I felt very rushed I felt like it

it was I felt very rushed I felt like it
was<00:05:22.110> wasn't<00:05:22.560> very<00:05:22.740> recognized<00:05:24.380> so<00:05:25.380> anyway

do the cross thinking on my left eye
which<00:05:41.370> was<00:05:41.520> quite<00:05:41.700> scary<00:05:44.479> what's<00:05:45.479> going<00:05:45.690> to

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
which was quite scary what's going to

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.469 
which was quite scary what's going to
the<00:05:45.919> details<00:05:46.919> of<00:05:46.979> that<00:05:47.100> so<00:05:47.310> they<00:05:47.520> got<00:05:48.270> the

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 
the details of that so they got the

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:50.200 
the details of that so they got the

collagen cross-linking is in three

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.290 
collagen cross-linking is in three
stages<00:05:51.100> they<00:05:52.100> administer<00:05:52.910> a<00:05:52.940> local

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
stages they administer a local

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.580 
stages they administer a local
anesthetic<00:05:53.919> and<00:05:54.919> then<00:05:55.600> they<00:05:56.600> scrape<00:05:56.930> the<00:05:57.169> the

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590 
anesthetic and then they scrape the the

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.170

surface of the cornea and obviously that

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.379 
surface of the cornea and obviously that
was<00:05:59.330> quite<00:05:59.539> scary<00:05:59.960> but<00:06:00.740> it<00:06:01.220> was<00:06:01.280> pain-free<00:06:01.639> and

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:02.389 
was quite scary but it was pain-free and

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:03.969 
was quite scary but it was pain-free and
you<00:06:02.569> didn't<00:06:02.780> feel<00:06:02.960> anything<00:06:02.990> it<00:06:03.710> was<00:06:03.830> only

you didn't feel anything it was only
quite<00:06:04.430> hazy<00:06:04.819> and<00:06:05.240> then<00:06:05.750> the<00:06:06.500> last<00:06:07.310> bit<00:06:07.490> of<00:06:07.550> the

quite hazy and then the last bit of the
