parts of the brain are involved like the

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.600

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
temporal lobe in a funnel lobe but this

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.660 
temporal lobe in a funnel lobe but this
left-sided<00:05:15.270> activation<00:05:15.990> then<00:05:16.740> it<00:05:17.490> is

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:17.670 
left-sided activation then it is

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.940 
left-sided activation then it is
suggesting<00:05:18.420> that<00:05:18.720> they<00:05:19.080> may<00:05:19.230> be<00:05:19.290> using<00:05:19.740> more

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
suggesting that they may be using more

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:25.130 
suggesting that they may be using more
analytic<00:05:20.610> and<00:05:20.820> detail<00:05:21.680> processing<00:05:23.990> so<00:05:24.990> what

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:25.140 
analytic and detail processing so what

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.810 
analytic and detail processing so what
this<00:05:25.260> may<00:05:25.440> mean<00:05:25.680> is<00:05:25.920> that<00:05:26.160> people<00:05:26.490> with<00:05:26.610> body

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
this may mean is that people with body

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:27.980 
this may mean is that people with body
this<00:05:26.970> motor<00:05:27.180> sort<00:05:27.510> of<00:05:27.600> when<00:05:27.690> they're<00:05:27.810> looking

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
this motor sort of when they're looking

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.770 
this motor sort of when they're looking
at<00:05:28.260> faces<00:05:28.500> their<00:05:29.370> brains<00:05:29.730> are<00:05:30.150> picking<00:05:30.630> out

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
at faces their brains are picking out

all the little details and putting
