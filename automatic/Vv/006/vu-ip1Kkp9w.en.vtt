00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.150 
turns out it's not very complicated but
it<00:02:03.520> does<00:02:03.700> require<00:02:03.850> steady<00:02:04.450> hand<00:02:04.800> the<00:02:05.800> easiest

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
it does require steady hand the easiest

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.020 
it does require steady hand the easiest
way<00:02:06.370> to<00:02:06.430> deal<00:02:06.640> with<00:02:06.670> it<00:02:06.820> is<00:02:07.120> to<00:02:07.330> use<00:02:07.450> guides

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
way to deal with it is to use guides

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.640 
way to deal with it is to use guides
using<00:02:10.030> a<00:02:10.090> toothpick<00:02:10.360> which<00:02:11.140> you<00:02:11.260> can<00:02:11.410> sharpen

connect those dots with the middle of
the<00:02:45.120> line<00:02:52.849> and<00:02:55.099> there<00:02:56.099> you<00:02:56.250> will<00:02:56.310> have<00:02:56.519> the

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
the line and there you will have the

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.820 
the line and there you will have the
first<00:02:56.880> part<00:02:57.180> of<00:02:57.239> the<00:02:57.360> pattern<00:03:00.680> we<00:03:01.680> can

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
first part of the pattern we can

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.589 
first part of the pattern we can
therefore<00:03:01.980> move<00:03:02.340> on<00:03:02.489> to<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:02.730> second<00:03:03.060> part<00:03:03.209> by

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
therefore move on to the second part by

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.240 
therefore move on to the second part by
drawing<00:03:03.900> two<00:03:04.049> new<00:03:04.319> dots<00:03:04.530> on<00:03:04.739> each<00:03:04.890> side<00:03:05.099> of<00:03:05.130> the

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
drawing two new dots on each side of the

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:15.410 
drawing two new dots on each side of the
first<00:03:05.519> one<00:03:05.730> we<00:03:05.819> painted

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.429 

while<00:03:16.420> trying<00:03:16.659> to<00:03:16.810> keep<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:17.049> design<00:03:17.290> as

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:17.439 
while trying to keep the design as

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:19.470 
while trying to keep the design as
symmetrical<00:03:17.920> as<00:03:18.040> possible<00:03:18.519> you're<00:03:19.209> on<00:03:19.269> your

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
symmetrical as possible you're on your

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.030 
symmetrical as possible you're on your
nail<00:03:19.629> six<00:03:19.959> other<00:03:20.140> dots<00:03:20.349> in<00:03:20.560> a<00:03:20.620> triangular

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
nail six other dots in a triangular

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:38.000 
nail six other dots in a triangular
formation<00:03:21.519> like<00:03:21.879> so

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.740 

now<00:03:39.010> connect<00:03:39.790> the<00:03:39.820> dots<00:03:40.060> you<00:03:40.180> just<00:03:40.360> made<00:03:40.540> in<00:03:40.690> a

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
now connect the dots you just made in a

00:03:40.750 --> 00:04:17.039 
now connect the dots you just made in a
white<00:03:40.930> sheet

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:18.899 

the<00:04:17.590> next<00:04:17.799> step<00:04:17.949> would<00:04:18.069> now<00:04:18.250> be<00:04:18.459> to<00:04:18.669> connect

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:18.909 
the next step would now be to connect

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:20.999 
the next step would now be to connect
the<00:04:19.090> three<00:04:19.359> branches<00:04:19.569> together<00:04:19.959> on<00:04:20.379> the<00:04:20.859> line

00:04:20.999 --> 00:04:21.009 
the three branches together on the line

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:23.999 
the three branches together on the line
of<00:04:21.159> the<00:04:21.250> French<00:04:21.459> manicure<00:04:21.930> to<00:04:22.930> do<00:04:23.050> so<00:04:23.259> start<00:04:23.889> on

00:04:23.999 --> 00:04:24.009 
of the French manicure to do so start on

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:25.469 
of the French manicure to do so start on
one<00:04:24.129> side<00:04:24.190> of<00:04:24.400> the<00:04:24.520> nail<00:04:24.669> and<00:04:24.879> paint<00:04:25.240> little

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
one side of the nail and paint little

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:48.880 
one side of the nail and paint little
arcs<00:04:25.840> between<00:04:25.960> the<00:04:26.349> branches<00:04:26.530> like<00:04:26.889> so

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:48.890 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.080 

we<00:04:49.890> are<00:04:50.010> now<00:04:50.130> almost<00:04:50.430> done<00:04:50.850> with<00:04:51.000> the

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
we are now almost done with the

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.450 
we are now almost done with the
snowflake<00:04:51.450> pattern<00:04:51.750> since<00:04:52.740> I<00:04:52.920> felt<00:04:53.160> there<00:04:53.340> was

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
snowflake pattern since I felt there was

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.980 
snowflake pattern since I felt there was
something<00:04:53.490> missing<00:04:54.000> when<00:04:54.330> I<00:04:54.360> first<00:04:54.660> did<00:04:54.810> this

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
something missing when I first did this

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.410 
something missing when I first did this
design<00:04:55.350> I<00:04:55.590> decided<00:04:56.280> to<00:04:56.520> add<00:04:56.640> two<00:04:56.880> small<00:04:57.180> lines

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
design I decided to add two small lines

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.180 
design I decided to add two small lines
on<00:04:57.570> the<00:04:57.690> arts<00:04:57.960> closest<00:04:58.470> to<00:04:58.590> the<00:04:58.680> middle<00:04:58.980> of<00:04:59.070> the
