00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.500
 up 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.300

 twice the grid with the bark 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.690
 sad the lightning strike the escort 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.650
 roon and matty and pi system so we go 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.019
 trying to do our best 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.280
 toy my cargo the jar is already 30 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:44.540
 Seconds busy so if course 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.650
 a little disadvantage 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.030
 but 30 seconds is not very bad 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.190
 much the we can still just us 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.659
 try best and we go 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.739
 see what can go back in before 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:53.600
 of course we just go for that growth 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.729
 score but of course with a random 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.229
 play glass that you do not know yourself 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:58.519
 always quite difficult and two trophy 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:00.799
 systems that we will use 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:02.600
 and there is hot shiro I had that 

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:04.430
 feel the range that my car and that 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.020
 not a bit vague back and forth I had 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.310
 the feeling that there is someone city but the 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.750
 city ​​is also really real 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.790
 someone here oh no no no no no no 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.260

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.030
 yes with bad 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.159
 Sodeknetter is so dirty and those fans are LEDs 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.659
 chose system and those are firm brakes 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:22.130
 yet no 'is coming again 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.939
 rotting close you come that fat is bad 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.469
 quick man 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:26.359
 he tries so many long distance and 

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:27.590
 shoot with his 

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:29.030
 rm i ton it can do that brake i want 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.619
 not at all i have i online 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.119
 ironing okay we throw here and here 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.680
 here it sometimes comes in my back 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.880
 you can keep an eye on 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.530
 again with a brake I do what you do now 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.270
 let's triple pill let's man all the time 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.530
 go and this is going in the right direction and dr 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.850
 livesey again a pity 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.229
 we were there now must again 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.630
 of course 30 kills we make this fire 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.310
 especially potje won and m27 I have 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.840
 stockpair wedges received from the 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.549
 random class as a natural feyenoord 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.890
 I have been along for ages and sometimes rival 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.020
 but of course got a grip and 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.820
 if there is not working in black or two and 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.719
 is then nothing for gillet 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.579
 and it is more something psychological 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:03.560
 so you think you can do what you think of it 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.539
 eye for crap I get less risk 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.549
 but actually get nothing at all 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:08.960
 for the rebol remains about normal 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.460
 you also have the same for control 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.780
 stand a weapon so that is quite one 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.130
 hard pole of course but continuous 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.600
 in my back 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.480
 you go through that truck young permar 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.220
 no you do but sit there what 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.200
 the fuck 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.030
 fuck oh shit he went next to that 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.890
 truck he took over system 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.540
 just destroy why again 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.250
 cho fascists that fans sat well so dirty 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.420
 , and I'm still a now not so dirty 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.800
 there is quite a bit of chemistry to hand 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.150
 I never use them on I 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.290
 actually nothing here 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.390
 but its just funny to be with 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.130
 you can use 'search all the way ' 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.810
 somewhere already in a fighting sense something's there 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.950
 in just have trophy sister by one 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.600
 previous pc 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.070
 you break it again with so dirty she 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.810
 just works like a die kooijman 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.220
 not so dirty is they go home 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.450
 hurry up and because they go on it 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.010
 I know exactly where they are shooting 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.360
 so I can chill them right away 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.040
 so it just works like a tico here 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.420
 he comes again 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.490
 because they again go anywhere here 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.500
 who is coming again now I will log in 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.120
 there's that name three times in a row 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.260
 ah runs there again in circumcision then 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.600
 Come here 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.310
 leave it behind you he ran away too 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.470
 don't walk the two 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.230
 your bingo your fat is pretty good with 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.760
 its the cikam cpb because it does hit me 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.080
 all the time but fortunately no longer 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.270
 that chilly because I have this random 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.160
 Lesson today so got toughness 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.000
 is really something very useful sim black 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.260
 the two of us 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.910
 it's going to come back in call of duty 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.830
 ghosts like and perk for two points 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.120
 I think and yes that helps anyway 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.470
 we don't aim the sky at all 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.840
 is about the moment you are hit 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.790
 and that is just something you need 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.070
 if you have normal choir stuff so if 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.870
 call if duty ghosts will come out soon 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.220
 I certainly also just the new 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.650
 turn on topless in the game 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.970
 because I personally have it 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.440
 always standing around a bottle like me 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.600
 just fire as we stuff our newspapers 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.790
 because it's really just super super handy 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.050
 is so I definitely recommend his toe 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.150
 on commission that chose it 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.340
 because it really works really well 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.290
 and if you like you fly with you right away 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.489
 target point and sky arrived in two 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.870
 stupid-0 around him is of course all that 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.040
 bullets after that because you aim with what 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.019
 is in the air and that and more than not 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.310
 more character , it really works a lot 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.750
 good 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.010
