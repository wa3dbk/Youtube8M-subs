00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
time to use more casting resin I also

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.700 
time to use more casting resin I also
try<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.670> experiment<00:01:27.180> with<00:01:27.450> how<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.810> layer<00:01:28.320> the

lot of resin I think I use about four
ounces<00:03:31.120> each<00:03:31.630> in<00:03:32.020> mixing<00:03:32.560> so<00:03:32.710> a<00:03:32.740> total<00:03:32.980> of

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
ounces each in mixing so a total of

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.840 
ounces each in mixing so a total of
eight<00:03:33.250> ounces<00:03:33.670> of<00:03:33.820> resin<00:03:34.180> to<00:03:34.360> make<00:03:34.540> this<00:03:34.750> so

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
eight ounces of resin to make this so

this is an experimentation so I use some
chalk<00:04:32.110> pastels<00:04:32.620> to<00:04:33.100> color<00:04:33.460> the<00:04:33.760> resin<00:04:34.120> and<00:04:34.270> the

chalk pastels to color the resin and the

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.800 
chalk pastels to color the resin and the
back<00:04:35.050> here<00:04:35.380> is<00:04:35.530> actually<00:04:36.040> a<00:04:36.280> match<00:04:37.060> so<00:04:37.450> here's

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
back here is actually a match so here's

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.510
