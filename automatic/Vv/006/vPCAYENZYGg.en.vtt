anything<00:02:34.650> is<00:02:34.709> out<00:02:34.950> I<00:02:35.370> think<00:02:35.670> everything<00:02:36.239> is<00:02:36.510> in

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780

it's finding what fits to your body and
that's<00:02:39.239> what's<00:02:39.450> so<00:02:39.570> great<00:02:39.600> about<00:02:39.780> training

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
that's what's so great about training

today<00:02:40.680> for<00:02:40.890> women<00:02:41.160> there's<00:02:41.580> so<00:02:41.790> many<00:02:41.910> options

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
today for women there's so many options

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
and there's so many great programs I

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.190 
and there's so many great programs I
think<00:02:44.940> it's<00:02:45.060> only<00:02:45.209> going<00:02:45.540> to<00:02:45.630> improve<00:02:45.780> then

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
think it's only going to improve then

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.180 
think it's only going to improve then
we're<00:02:46.290> only<00:02:46.440> gonna<00:02:46.680> see<00:02:46.860> more<00:02:46.980> precipitation

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
we're only gonna see more precipitation

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.150 
we're only gonna see more precipitation
with<00:02:47.940> time
