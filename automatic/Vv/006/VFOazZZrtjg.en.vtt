00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:02.070

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:05.100
 up to 6 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.210
 and it is the same as not all something behind on 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.409
 apart from everything 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.409
 and know the game 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.890
 Who 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.590

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.270
 and pass 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.760
 but 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.970
 but 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.270
 2

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.780
 monkey volume 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:28.140
 Ilya 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.120
 I'll be honest 1 hour of your speech 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.790
 no supporter at all when dancing 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:37.560
 begin to show the text with 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:41.970
 so very zealously heart like a fist soul 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.530
 like a gun or bullshit you know 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.120
 when vocabulary you don't know what 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.000
 say you start to cling for some reason 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.920
 for words and show on yourself on the body 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.020
 everything else in the text I 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.750
 not a supporter of it at all 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:57.450
 speaks of scarcity in general 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:00.209
 choreographic capacity in drive 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.490
 you have to you have some lit 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.610
 because it was obvious that you are here 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:08.490
 something inside that basically gives you 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.830
 a chance to catch on somehow I don’t know what 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:13.340
 say glad 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:15.900
 the original you kid me personally very much 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:20.959
 it would be interesting to watch you in 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.959
 alien choreography is therefore heavy duty in the evening 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:29.780
 the verdict of the court of mitrokhin with examined g for 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.780
 such pro
