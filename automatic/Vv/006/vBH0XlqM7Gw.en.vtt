00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.720
 scientists from around the world try to unravel the mystery that can tear down 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.020
 the concepts about the limits of the universe who explain the corresponding

00:00:13.689 --> 00:00:14.830
 of all laws 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.610
 those governing the functioning of the universe seemed to be the 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:25.430
 speed of light at almost 300,000 kilometers per second to Bern

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.820
 stated that nothing could move faster this is the limit for example of 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.980
 all transmissions of human communication 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.460
 but an experiment that began in Switzerland put that limit in doubt

 of the European Center for Nuclear Research in Geneva 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.230
 a neutrino beam was fired underground 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:50.949

 the particles smaller than an atom traveled in a carreata 723 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.580

 says that the Italian laboratory is not the most important in the world and not only 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.100
 precision equipment but also because it has an excellent

 twitter places for several months and look for an explanation some mistake 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.190
 but we did not find people singing we felt compelled to divulge the 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.170
 results for others to verify our unique experience 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.409
 the question until it is confirmed by science needs to be confronted with 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:54.890
 other experiences 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.950
 currently in both the United States and Japan 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.939
 similar research is being carried out 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:05.640
 the national institute of nuclear physics of italy believes that in a year the 

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:09.929
 world will know that neutrinos are no faster than light
