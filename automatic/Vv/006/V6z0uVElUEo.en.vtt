from injuries have stayed away from this
view<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:38.189> think<00:01:38.369> it's<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.520> smart<00:01:38.640> move<00:01:38.850> i<00:01:39.150> think

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
view I think it's a smart move i think

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.219 
view I think it's a smart move i think
they've<00:01:39.479> really<00:01:39.720> done<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.869> good<00:01:40.020> job<00:01:40.079> of

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
they've really done a good job of

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.810 
they've really done a good job of
managing<00:01:40.500> all<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:40.979> this<00:01:41.280> i<00:01:41.430> mean<00:01:41.460> it's<00:01:41.670> been

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
managing all of this i mean it's been

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.899 
managing all of this i mean it's been
very<00:01:41.970> difficult<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.630> gauge<00:01:42.840> how<00:01:43.560> far<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.759> know

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
very difficult to gauge how far you know

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.249 
very difficult to gauge how far you know
he<00:01:45.030> can<00:01:45.210> take<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.509> right<00:01:45.540> now<00:01:45.840> but<00:01:46.049> i<00:01:46.079> mean<00:01:46.229> i

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
he can take it right now but i mean i

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.840 
he can take it right now but i mean i
think<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.799> best<00:01:47.009> is<00:01:47.189> yet<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.490> come<00:01:47.520> obviously

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
think the best is yet to come obviously

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.370 
think the best is yet to come obviously
he'll<00:01:48.299> kill<00:01:48.479> get<00:01:48.659> out<00:01:48.780> there<00:01:48.960> he'll<00:01:49.079> get<00:01:49.200> fit

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
he'll kill get out there he'll get fit

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.810 
he'll kill get out there he'll get fit
