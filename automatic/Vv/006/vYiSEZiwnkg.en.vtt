00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049 
enough ranking on each of these islands

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:19.240 
enough ranking on each of these islands
so<00:02:16.250> good<00:02:17.250> stuff<00:02:17.549> in<00:02:17.670> terms<00:02:17.910> of<00:02:18.090> unlocks<00:02:18.599> there

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
here two different modes one is the

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.870 
here two different modes one is the

highest score out of five islands and

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.750 
highest score out of five islands and
the<00:02:27.450> other<00:02:27.570> is<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:28.079> first<00:02:28.500> to<00:02:28.769> 10,000<00:02:29.519> so

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
the other is the first to 10,000 so

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.289 
the other is the first to 10,000 so

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
you can choose handicap timers if you

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.039 
you can choose handicap timers if you

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
am pretty sure the other it is that

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.610 
am pretty sure the other it is that
there's<00:02:42.030> often<00:02:42.269> fraught<00:02:42.540> ematic<00:02:42.900> handicap<00:02:43.380> so

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
there's often fraught ematic handicap so

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.840 
there's often fraught ematic handicap so
if<00:02:43.799> someone's<00:02:44.160> doing<00:02:44.250> really<00:02:44.489> really<00:02:44.609> well

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
if someone's doing really really well

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.150 
if someone's doing really really well
they'll<00:02:45.660> automatically<00:02:46.260> get<00:02:46.440> a<00:02:46.470> handicap<00:02:46.739> put

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
they'll automatically get a handicap put

they'll automatically get a handicap put
on<00:02:47.310> them<00:02:47.430> so<00:02:48.060> that's<00:02:48.299> that's<00:02:48.600> a<00:02:48.750> nice<00:02:48.989> kind<00:02:49.290> of
