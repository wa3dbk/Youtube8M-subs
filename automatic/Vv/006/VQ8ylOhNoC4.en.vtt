00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.050
 of international information 

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:05.390
 Spaniards do not know what to do with 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:08.810
 those Africans who try to enter 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.250
 to his territory Peter Brieger this one 

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.630
 which is why we are now seeing the 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.120
 map of north africa what 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:18.109
 commonly called the morocco morghreb 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:20.150
 Algeria Tunisia and Libya on purpose today in 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:21.619
 Libya tried to take weapons from a 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.919
 weapons deposit is said to have died 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:27.650
 more than 40 people but let's go back to 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:29.869
 Morocco we see Spain and Morocco in the 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.029
 map what we see in the north of 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.670
 Morocco are two Spanish cities 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.770
 ceuta and melilla have borders by 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.140
 course with morocco morocco always 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.180
 It asks the Spanish government to 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.920
 Moroccan territory that actually what 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.240
 they have to leave the Spaniards to 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.270
 renault abandon are two enclaves 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:50.000
 Spanish colonials in the north of 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.190
 morocco ceuta and melilla many 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.980
 Africans especially Moroccans but 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.940
 They do not just try to enter Ceuta and 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.980
 melilla because it is in the territory 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.180
 Spanish who crosses the border is in 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.520
 Spanish territory 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:05.030
 the Spaniards try to avoid it as 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.400
 they do at the border they have wiring 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.409
 and on many occasions if you are motivated 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.229
 all a great debate have placed 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.490
 razor blades on the wiring in 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.530
 the consequences are obviously 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.780
 terrible people climb the fence 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.600
 to try to cross over to Ceuta and 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.520
 Melilla dies dies bleeding 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.869
 cutting this is discussed in the 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.270
 Spanish parliament that proposed the 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.070
 Spanish workers socialist party that 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.320
 is against the blades that are 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.930
 they use to be used from now on more 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.690
 unmanned aircraft the acquaintances with 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.420
 the word in English bronze usa usa 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.119
 in pakistan in yemen in somalia in 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.590
 afghanistan to kill people what it says 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.960
 the Spanish socialist workers party 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.929
 we have to use them to monitor the 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.210
 border or the big debate is how 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:53.780
 prevent Africans from getting in 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.360
 Spanish territory what they do not debate is 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.179
 why not leave ceuta melilla 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.080
 being that in the south of Spain and this 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:02.119
 We have commented on more than one 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.789
 opportunity is the famous opinion of 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:07.399
 Gibraltar Spain says to the 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:09.380
 British that withdraw from the territory 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.300
 of Gibraltar but when Morocco 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:15.420
 says to retire from Ceuta and Melilla 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.090
 is that not the big debate is how to avoid 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.100
 that the Africans get into Ceuta and 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.050
 melilla in two small cities with 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.030
 little population but that the Moroccans 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.760
 these territories say our clearings 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.840
 when you look at the map you realize 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.840
 clearly it is the north of africa
