00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
different programming in different

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.990 
different programming in different

you can achieve select from select it

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.730 
you can achieve select from select it
and<00:03:00.950> then<00:03:01.070> play<00:03:01.340> it<00:03:01.959> and<00:03:02.959> like<00:03:03.260> I<00:03:03.410> said<00:03:03.470> it

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
and then play it and like I said it

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.350 
and then play it and like I said it
usually<00:03:04.040> takes<00:03:05.230> 3<00:03:06.230> to<00:03:06.260> 4<00:03:06.620> seconds<00:03:07.160> and<00:03:07.340> once<00:03:08.180> it

usually takes 3 to 4 seconds and once it

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.880 
usually takes 3 to 4 seconds and once it
has<00:03:08.510> been<00:03:08.630> completed<00:03:08.840> and<00:03:09.380> you<00:03:09.440> can<00:03:09.590> actually

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
has been completed and you can actually

has been completed and you can actually
view<00:03:10.130> it<00:03:11.260> and<00:03:12.820> that's<00:03:13.820> practically<00:03:14.300> all<00:03:14.420> you

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
view it and that's practically all you

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.570 
view it and that's practically all you
need<00:03:15.320> to<00:03:15.470> do<00:03:15.590> in<00:03:15.709> order<00:03:15.890> for<00:03:16.100> you<00:03:16.190> to<00:03:16.220> view<00:03:16.459> the
