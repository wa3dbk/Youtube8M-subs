00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
again your chocolate becomes a little

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.940 
again your chocolate becomes a little
runny<00:03:06.330> because<00:03:06.750> it<00:03:06.930> will<00:03:07.140> dry<00:03:07.380> and<00:03:07.680> you<00:03:07.800> can

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
runny because it will dry and you can

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.190 
runny because it will dry and you can
always<00:03:08.130> fix<00:03:08.490> that<00:03:08.730> with<00:03:09.000> a<00:03:09.270> toothpick<00:03:09.630> and
