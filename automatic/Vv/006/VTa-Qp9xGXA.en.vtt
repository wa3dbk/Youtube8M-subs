00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.179 
hi I'm Albert and today we're reviewing
this<00:00:04.950> program<00:00:05.430> called<00:00:05.670> detox<00:00:06.210> my<00:00:06.450> pc<00:00:07.189> I'd

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
this program called detox my pc I'd

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.610 
this program called detox my pc I'd
started<00:00:08.849> using<00:00:09.330> it<00:00:09.599> because<00:00:09.780> my<00:00:10.050> pc<00:00:10.440> was

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
started using it because my pc was

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.740 
started using it because my pc was
lagging<00:00:11.130> and<00:00:11.309> I<00:00:11.759> was<00:00:11.910> running<00:00:12.210> out<00:00:12.300> of<00:00:12.360> free

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
lagging and I was running out of free

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.140 
lagging and I was running out of free
space<00:00:13.080> on<00:00:13.410> my<00:00:13.620> hard<00:00:13.650> drive<00:00:14.040> so<00:00:14.490> I<00:00:14.519> decided<00:00:14.910> to

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
space on my hard drive so I decided to

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.109 
space on my hard drive so I decided to
give<00:00:15.389> it<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.540> go<00:00:15.690> I<00:00:16.640> installed<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.880> full

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
give it a go I installed the full

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.640 
give it a go I installed the full
version<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.750> it's<00:00:18.869> important<00:00:19.350> because<00:00:19.439> many

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
version and it's important because many

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.040 
version and it's important because many
options<00:00:20.279> are<00:00:20.430> limited<00:00:20.880> in<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.420> shareware

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
options are limited in the shareware

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.730 
options are limited in the shareware
version<00:00:22.850> so<00:00:23.850> let<00:00:24.180> us<00:00:24.210> now<00:00:24.449> see<00:00:24.689> how<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:24.960> runs<00:00:25.140> we

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
version so let us now see how it runs we

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.349 
version so let us now see how it runs we
start<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.189> scan<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.789> here<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.720> goes<00:00:27.960> it's

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:29.359 
start the scan and here it goes it's

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.319 
start the scan and here it goes it's
detoxes<00:00:30.359> history<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:31.710> detoxes<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:33.090> cache

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
detoxes history it detoxes the cache

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.010 
detoxes history it detoxes the cache
logs<00:00:34.290> trash<00:00:35.010> temporary<00:00:35.760> files<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.510> can<00:00:36.719> see

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
logs trash temporary files you can see

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.350 
logs trash temporary files you can see
the<00:00:37.170> full<00:00:37.380> list<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.219> does<00:00:38.430> in<00:00:38.700> here<00:00:39.180> and

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
the full list that it does in here and

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.229 
the full list that it does in here and
it<00:00:39.989> also<00:00:40.170> fixes<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.010> registry<00:00:41.610> which<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:41.910> very

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
it also fixes the registry which is very

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.810 
it also fixes the registry which is very
important<00:00:42.780> because<00:00:42.899> over<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.770> time<00:00:44.160> windows

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
important because over the time windows

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.690 
important because over the time windows
become<00:00:45.180> stacked<00:00:45.660> with<00:00:45.899> all<00:00:46.050> kinds<00:00:46.530> of

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
become stacked with all kinds of

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.729 
become stacked with all kinds of
registry<00:00:47.700> leftovers<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.989> it's<00:00:49.350> great<00:00:49.559> to

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
registry leftovers and it's great to

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.290 
registry leftovers and it's great to
have<00:00:49.860> them<00:00:50.100> removed<00:00:50.460> which<00:00:50.820> will<00:00:51.000> make<00:00:51.120> your

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
have them removed which will make your

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.619 
have them removed which will make your
pc<00:00:51.660> run<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:51.989> lot<00:00:52.320> faster<00:00:52.940> ok<00:00:53.940> so<00:00:54.329> now<00:00:54.570> the

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
pc run a lot faster ok so now the

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.049 
pc run a lot faster ok so now the
scanning<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.379> complete<00:00:55.800> as<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.250> can<00:00:56.399> see<00:00:56.610> here

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
scanning is complete as you can see here

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.139 
scanning is complete as you can see here
it<00:00:57.210> has<00:00:57.510> found<00:00:58.050> forty<00:00:59.010> eight<00:00:59.250> gigabytes<00:01:00.000> of

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
it has found forty eight gigabytes of

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.810 
it has found forty eight gigabytes of
temporary<00:01:00.750> files<00:01:01.109> which<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.100> can<00:01:02.280> remove<00:01:02.609> and

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
temporary files which I can remove and

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.729 
temporary files which I can remove and
it'll<00:01:03.090> be<00:01:03.180> amazing<00:01:03.539> because<00:01:04.019> it<00:01:04.199> will<00:01:04.439> recover

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
it'll be amazing because it will recover

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.240 
it'll be amazing because it will recover
so<00:01:05.250> much<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.700> free<00:01:06.119> space<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:07.200> has<00:01:07.590> also<00:01:07.799> found

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
so much of free space it has also found

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.969 
so much of free space it has also found
some<00:01:08.909> problems<00:01:09.510> in<00:01:09.720> my<00:01:09.840> registry<00:01:10.590> which<00:01:10.860> is

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
some problems in my registry which is

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.429 
some problems in my registry which is
also<00:01:11.460> great<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.880> be<00:01:12.210> fixed<00:01:12.750> here<00:01:12.930> we<00:01:13.290> can

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
also great to be fixed here we can

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.010 
also great to be fixed here we can
review<00:01:13.770> what<00:01:14.070> will<00:01:14.400> be<00:01:14.549> fixed<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.150> what<00:01:15.780> won't

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.749 
that it doesn't touch the history which
I<00:01:21.180> probably<00:01:21.390> need<00:01:21.840> now<00:01:22.740> as<00:01:22.950> far<00:01:23.159> as<00:01:23.340> cash<00:01:23.549> is
