00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:04.510
 I 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:14.799
 external 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:30.100
 and it's curiosities about goian 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.650
 number 1 rohan in the resurrection of 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.600
 freser uses this new green garb 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.880
 because he could not get to his 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.920
 house to change and put on his suit 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.989
 of battle so he wears the new clothes 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.739
 that bought just the one that is 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:46.360
 loading in those boxes number 2 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.580
 currently in dragon ball super is still 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.070
 more powerful than goku and vegeta since 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.530
 possesses the mystic state which is more 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.660
 mighty than a super sayayin 3 but 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.820
 later in the resurrection to offer his 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.800
 power is clearly surpassed by goku and 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.739
 vegeta that could reach the phase 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.370
 super sayayin god super sayayin number 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.619
 3 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.690
 gokhan transformed into super sayayin 2 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:10.060
 in the room of time and not against 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.619
 be as many believed although this one only 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.200
 was seen by goku and only lasted two 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.270
 second number 4 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.710
 goian could have overcome the powers of 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.050
 Goku if I had continued training 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.450
 because the union of human blood and 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.759
 sayayin makes him more facilitate the 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.619
 transformations and therefore have a 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.890
 level of power superior to others there 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:32.080
 a jim is purebred give number 5 goian 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.640
 of the alternative future never reached the 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.070
 transformation of his Persian 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.930
 cute apparently never got 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.580
 enough will go to achieve that 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.979
 transformation of having reached it 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.130
 could have killed the androids 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:47.619
 easily number 6 yes goian it 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.200
 transforms into super sayayin in your state 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.420
 mystic his power would not change it would only be 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.610
 its appearance and it would be wasted more 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.759
 energy this is said when they release the 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.890
 hidden power of goian number 7 in the 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.619
 dragon ball z budokai video game 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.200
 Tenkaichi 3 enjoy the alternate future 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:07.390
 appears with his two arms this is due 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.750
 that if they had only put it with a 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.910
 arm could not perform combos well 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.459
 number 8 the great suit are called and 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.350
 his ridiculous poses are inspired by 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.910
 the healing forces that to them 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.820
 they were made in honor of the power 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.950
 rangers like number 9 when goian 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.230
 start to fight against wow they use the 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.470
 Same positions as when Goku fights 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.570
 against vegeta number 10 at the beginning of 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.400
 the saga of the androids your your tower 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.470
 he says he was not going to do anything 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.269
 These words are very similar to 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.440
 they told Albert Einstein the 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:40.060
 famous scientist 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.940

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.300

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.700
