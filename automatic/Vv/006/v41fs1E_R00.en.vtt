00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
even though he hasn't painted yet so I

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.530 
even though he hasn't painted yet so I
basically<00:01:07.740> did<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.070> same<00:01:08.310> thing<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.790> got<00:01:09.420> some

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
basically did the same thing I got some

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.630 
basically did the same thing I got some
old<00:01:09.720> paints<00:01:10.140> from<00:01:10.229> old<00:01:10.979> warhammer<00:01:11.549> stuff
