00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.560
 rock 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:23.720
 This is it, guys, I'm with some andal 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:27.950
 Live milk 250cc engine in v 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:31.419
 a motorcycle that gave a gas is not 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:35.480
 initially for the 50 line but the 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:38.410
 president of the action ended up leaving the 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.670
 walk to invest in it so that 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.460
 stopped walking sideways and now also 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.380
 let it be that way because it's because 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:49.790
 turned where it goes 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:55.040
 and it ends with everything so that matter is 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:56.090
 carburetion and it will not be possible to 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.180
 filming 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:02.210
 this time to go pro goal over the 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.950
 battery unfortunately I will not change with 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:10.729
 she and then I'll say what I found 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:11.720
 she is able to ride the bike and it is good that 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.320
 I can speak 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.630
 She is very different from the mirage she 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.460
 is not focused on performance in the 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.630
 The city is doing very well even though I 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.810
 I found the bank a little rough but on the highway 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.700
 I do not know how she would behave 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:32.090
 This is the one from here haviland there a 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:35.600
 option and ge 250 cubic 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.830
 It's going to be difficult to find the pieces. 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.790
 is not compatible this engine 1 and 6 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.580
 mooring turn 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.500
 I do not know how to tell you but the mirage sent 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.470
 this suzuki is easier to find 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.299
 share compatibility but it will be 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.440
 that in times of crisis is not a project of 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.979
 some other motorcycle 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.119
 usually it is the turn that they 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.240
 take the project 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:04.820
 she talks about the ticket has the garinni has to 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:06.470
 shineray xy 250 and is this option for 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:12.759
 everyone 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:12.759
 I'm just here with ax the ax
