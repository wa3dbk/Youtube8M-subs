 our hearts and is true is the 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.570
 bible I believe in this book as the sword 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.240
 double-edged that is able to penetrate 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.890

 word and its truth by the spirit 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.510
 holy for this reason if you think that 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.270
 this word is not true and true 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.700

 will teach the way and the truth then this

 it is a book of faith and prophecy the bible 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.730

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:55.129

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.360
 they write 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.670
 by divine authority under the direction 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.920
 of the holy spirit which makes the 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.549

 all of it is with play is evident 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.909
 that is the work of a mastermind the 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.670
 world recognizes the divinity of the book 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.380
 the great thinkers have placed the 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.950
 bible in a separate category 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:41.509
 recognizing his supernatural character the 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:45.539
 book of apocalypse says apocalypse 22 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:47.550
 18 19 I testified to everyone who hears 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:50.220
 the words of the prophecy of this 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.740
 book if someone added these things 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.580
 God will bring upon him the plagues that 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.560
 are written in this book verse 19 and 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.990
 if any one will remove from the words of 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.360
 book of this prophecy God will take away his 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.369
 part of the book of life and the saint 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.950
 city ​​and the things that are written 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.039
 in this book 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.440
 what is faith there are several points very 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.379
 important which we must have 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.930
 clear if these are any human being 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:21.170
 can create faith and it is Jesus the author and 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.470
 consummate faith 12 2 faith is not 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.810
 to see and to believe is therefore faith the certainty 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.140
 of what is expected the conviction of what 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.569
 who does not see Hebrews 11 1 faith works by 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.400
 love because in Christ Jesus neither the 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.650
 circumcision is worth something or the 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.879
 circumcision but the faith that works for the 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.880
 love 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:43.010
 Galatians 55 the true faith is not 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.280
 based on the word of any man 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:49.610
 without in the word of God is not to believe 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.160
 men is and believe god so the 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:56.390
 faith comes by hearing and hearing the word of 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:59.019
 Roman god 10 17 the hand of god is not 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.840
 moves by needs but by faith 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:05.599
 without faith it is impossible to please God 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.549
 Hebrews 11 6 our requests must 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:10.010
 be based on the word of 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.780
 God believing what God says so that 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.090
 be answered 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.610
 this is the confidence we have in the 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.360
 that if we ask for something according to your 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.450
 Will 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.910
 he hears us and if we know that he is not in 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.860
 anything we ask we know that 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:29.690
 we have the requests that we have 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:32.390
 made an eye on 5 14 15 faith comes by 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.850
 the jesus wef asked when the 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:39.260
 son of man will find faith on earth 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:41.569
 lucas 18 8 good question how is 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.870
 our faith how many have true faith 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:47.989
 in Mr. jesus to the water those who had 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:52.190
 much faith said to the Canaanite woman or woman 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:54.769
 great your faith mateo 15 28 about the 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.050
 faith of the centurion said of certain I say to you 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:04:00.530
 that not even in Israel and found so much faith 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.900
 I killed 810 but unfortunately said to 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:06.680
 times to his disciples men of little 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:10.130
 faith mathematician 630 what would Jesus say about our 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.920
 faith the apostle Paul says justified 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.950
 because by faith we have peace with God 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.209
 through our Lord Jesus Christ 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:21.350
 Romans 51 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:23.600
 many have memorized John 316 because of 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.970
 such a way God loved the world that has given 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.250
 his only begotten son so that everyone 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:31.310
 that in him he believes he does not lose but has 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:34.520
 eternal life but what kind of faith do we 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.470
 save you see that man 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.630
 is justified by the works and not 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.000
 only by faith because as the 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.069
 body without spirit is dead like that 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.360
 also faith without works is dead 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:49.009
 santiago 2 24 26 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:52.130
 Santiago uses the same word as Pablo 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:54.580
 therefore justified uses faith 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:58.039
 it saves us it has to be an obedient faith 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:00.020
 but to obey that the faith that saves has 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:02.750
 to be the one who comes to hear the word 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:06.110
 of God so faith is by hearing and 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:09.320
 hear by the word of Roman god 10 17 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:12.530
 that is, we can not believe doctrines 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.780
 biblical and wait for God to save us the 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.180
 gospel is simple everyone can 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:22.030
 understand and you need to obey it two 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:25.700
 by saloni senses 181 pedro 122 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:28.550
 17 everyone will be judged by the word 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:32.000
 of Jesus the word that I have spoken she 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:34.610
 will judge him on the last day John 12 48 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.950
 the apostle Paul talks about the day when 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.290
 God will judge by Jesus Christ the secrets 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:43.940
 of men according to my gospel 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:45.980
 Romans 2 16 it suits us then to study 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.930
 with all diligence the teaching of 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:51.320
 Jesus and his apostles revealed in the 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:53.630
 new testament is necessary to have the 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.120
 attitude of the duties that received the 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:58.100
 word with all your request scrutinizing 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:02.060
 every day the scriptures to see if 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:04.070
 these things were thus done 17 11 when 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:07.130
 the apostle Peter came to the house of 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:10.550
 cornelius this said you have done well in 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:13.130
 come now because all of us are 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:15.320
 here in the presence of God to hear 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:19.490
 everything God has sent you facts 10 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:21.500
 33 attitude of beautiful though cornelius 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:24.070
 He was a Roman military man of great authority 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:27.350
 he humbled himself before the word of God 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:29.840
 I wanted to know and obey his will 

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:32.090
 the decision to believe is yours and if 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.790
 having the word of God and the truth 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.890
 of Christ you do not repent and you look for his 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:39.520
 I'm sorry to tell you that desert 

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.520
 you will die
