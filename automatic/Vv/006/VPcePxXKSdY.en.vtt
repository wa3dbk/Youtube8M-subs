00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
level dungeon ears but I imagine it's

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.399 
level dungeon ears but I imagine it's

still pretty good amount of tokens if

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.530 
still pretty good amount of tokens if
you<00:01:31.560> are<00:01:31.680> lower<00:01:31.890> level<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:33.390> would

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
kind of messed up but in this video I

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.550 
kind of messed up but in this video I
believe<00:01:47.340> we<00:01:47.729> did<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.060> sinkhole<00:01:48.479> in<00:01:48.659> about<00:01:48.960> six

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
believe we did the sinkhole in about six

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.130 
believe we did the sinkhole in about six
minutes<00:01:49.799> or<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:51.329> what<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.720> want<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.020> do

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
minutes or so and so what you want to do

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.749 
minutes or so and so what you want to do
is<00:01:52.259> just<00:01:52.470> go<00:01:52.649> through<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:53.130> kill<00:01:53.549> all<00:01:53.729> the

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
is just go through and kill all the

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.139 
is just go through and kill all the
monsters<00:01:54.240> really<00:01:54.450> fast<00:01:55.219> in<00:01:56.219> all<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.820> rooms

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
monsters really fast in all of the rooms

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.429 
monsters really fast in all of the rooms
that<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.479> open<00:01:57.840> up<00:01:57.990> there<00:01:58.259> will<00:01:58.409> be

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
that you open up there will be

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.819 
that you open up there will be
exploratory<00:01:59.369> tokens<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:00.540> if<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:01.049> are<00:02:01.380> totems

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
exploratory tokens so if you are totems

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.010 
exploratory tokens so if you are totems
so<00:02:02.460> if<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:02.820> see<00:02:03.060> one<00:02:03.210> of<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.420> red<00:02:03.600> totems

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
so if you see one of the red totems

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.170 
so if you see one of the red totems
immediately<00:02:04.560> pick<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:04.890> up<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.820> second

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
immediately pick it up and the second

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.089 
immediately pick it up and the second
thing<00:02:06.299> you<00:02:06.420> want<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.659> do<00:02:06.840> on<00:02:07.079> upon<00:02:07.530> entering<00:02:07.860> a

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
thing you want to do on upon entering a

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.790 
thing you want to do on upon entering a
room<00:02:08.310> is<00:02:08.660> to<00:02:09.660> kill<00:02:09.869> all<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.140> monsters<00:02:10.590> within

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
room is to kill all the monsters within

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.420 
room is to kill all the monsters within
the<00:02:11.039> room

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
the room

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.759 
the room
and<00:02:11.519> pick<00:02:11.939> up<00:02:12.120> any<00:02:12.329> combat<00:02:12.989> totems<00:02:13.439> that<00:02:13.620> they

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
and pick up any combat totems that they

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.119 
and pick up any combat totems that they
drop<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.280> you'll<00:02:14.700> get<00:02:14.879> points<00:02:15.269> for<00:02:15.450> that<00:02:15.569> and

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 
drop and you'll get points for that and

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.830 
drop and you'll get points for that and
once<00:02:17.129> all<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.670> rooms<00:02:17.939> have<00:02:18.090> been<00:02:18.269> opened<00:02:18.629> and

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
once all the rooms have been opened and

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.720 
once all the rooms have been opened and
all<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.290> monsters<00:02:19.680> are<00:02:19.860> dead<00:02:20.099> then<00:02:20.370> you<00:02:20.400> can

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
all the monsters are dead then you can

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.399 
all the monsters are dead then you can
go<00:02:20.879> around<00:02:20.970> and<00:02:21.269> gather<00:02:21.390> resources<00:02:21.900> there's

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 
go around and gather resources there's

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:24.319 
go around and gather resources there's
really<00:02:22.650> no<00:02:22.890> point<00:02:23.189> before<00:02:23.340> that<00:02:23.549> because<00:02:24.120> the

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
really no point before that because the

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:27.920 
really no point before that because the
exploration<00:02:25.110> totems<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:25.879> the<00:02:26.879> combat<00:02:27.569> totems

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
exploration totems and the combat totems

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.899 
exploration totems and the combat totems
give<00:02:28.260> more<00:02:28.680> points<00:02:29.220> than<00:02:29.430> killing<00:02:29.819> the

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
give more points than killing the

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.270 
give more points than killing the
monsters<00:02:30.390> as<00:02:31.170> you<00:02:31.319> can<00:02:31.470> see<00:02:31.620> this<00:02:31.769> is<00:02:31.920> my<00:02:32.040> first

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
monsters as you can see this is my first

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.759 
monsters as you can see this is my first
time<00:02:32.489> that's<00:02:32.730> why<00:02:32.909> I'm<00:02:33.030> picking<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.769> Nettles

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
time that's why I'm picking the Nettles

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.399 
time that's why I'm picking the Nettles
but<00:02:35.430> you<00:02:35.579> want<00:02:35.819> to<00:02:36.000> wait<00:02:36.209> to<00:02:36.599> do<00:02:36.780> that<00:02:36.989> and<00:02:37.170> tell

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
but you want to wait to do that and tell

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:39.470 
but you want to wait to do that and tell
all<00:02:37.709> the<00:02:37.950> combat<00:02:38.310> totems<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:39.000> exploratory

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
all the combat totems and exploratory

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.140 
all the combat totems and exploratory
totems<00:02:40.049> have<00:02:40.170> been<00:02:40.290> found<00:02:40.560> because<00:02:41.159> you<00:02:42.000> get

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
totems have been found because you get

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.089 
totems have been found because you get
more<00:02:42.269> points<00:02:42.510> for<00:02:42.750> them<00:02:42.870> so<00:02:43.440> you<00:02:43.530> want<00:02:43.950> to

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
more points for them so you want to

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.460 
more points for them so you want to
ideally<00:02:44.670> not<00:02:45.030> be<00:02:45.299> in<00:02:45.450> fifth<00:02:45.750> place<00:02:45.959> because

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
ideally not be in fifth place because

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.809 
ideally not be in fifth place because
that<00:02:46.500> kind<00:02:46.889> of<00:02:46.920> puts<00:02:47.159> you<00:02:47.280> in<00:02:47.370> a<00:02:47.430> bad<00:02:47.549> position

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
that kind of puts you in a bad position

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.869 
that kind of puts you in a bad position
fifth<00:02:48.540> place<00:02:48.780> gets<00:02:49.079> the<00:02:49.260> small<00:02:49.530> lamp<00:02:49.829> and<00:02:50.099> I

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
fifth place gets the small lamp and I

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.879 
fifth place gets the small lamp and I
believe<00:02:51.269> the<00:02:52.019> fourth<00:02:52.260> place<00:02:52.560> gets

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:52.889 
believe the fourth place gets

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:54.680 
believe the fourth place gets
dungeoneering<00:02:53.400> tokens<00:02:53.940> or<00:02:54.180> maybe<00:02:54.450> that's

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
dungeoneering tokens or maybe that's

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.750 
dungeoneering tokens or maybe that's
third<00:02:54.870> place<00:02:55.139> anyway<00:02:56.040> you'll<00:02:56.220> see<00:02:56.430> at<00:02:56.519> the<00:02:56.549> end

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
third place anyway you'll see at the end

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.360 
third place anyway you'll see at the end
of<00:02:56.849> the<00:02:56.939> video<00:02:57.180> exactly<00:02:57.510> how<00:02:57.780> it<00:02:57.900> goes<00:02:58.079> but<00:02:59.010> um

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
of the video exactly how it goes but um

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.809 
of the video exactly how it goes but um
yeah<00:03:00.359> you<00:03:00.420> want<00:03:00.870> to<00:03:00.959> wait<00:03:01.590> until<00:03:02.189> all<00:03:02.489> the

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
yeah you want to wait until all the

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.210 
yeah you want to wait until all the
tokens<00:03:03.540> are<00:03:03.870> found<00:03:04.139> and<00:03:04.470> then<00:03:04.709> gather<00:03:05.040> the

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
tokens are found and then gather the

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.789 
tokens are found and then gather the
nettles<00:03:05.519> and<00:03:05.730> it<00:03:05.879> is<00:03:06.000> a<00:03:06.030> really<00:03:06.450> easy

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
nettles and it is a really easy

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.020 
nettles and it is a really easy
distraction<00:03:07.799> diversion<00:03:08.340> I<00:03:08.459> would<00:03:08.579> recommend

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
distraction diversion I would recommend

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.539 
distraction diversion I would recommend

dungeoneering<00:03:16.949> XP<00:03:17.430> um<00:03:18.109> one<00:03:19.109> thing<00:03:19.319> that<00:03:19.470> you

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
dungeoneering XP um one thing that you

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.490 
dungeoneering XP um one thing that you
can<00:03:19.949> do<00:03:20.190> is<00:03:20.370> you<00:03:20.519> can<00:03:20.790> just<00:03:20.870> stand<00:03:21.870> at<00:03:22.379> the

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
can do is you can just stand at the

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.110 
can do is you can just stand at the
starting<00:03:22.829> point<00:03:22.889> not<00:03:23.340> do<00:03:23.609> anything<00:03:23.849> and

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
starting point not do anything and

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.720 
starting point not do anything and
basically<00:03:24.510> just<00:03:24.840> afk<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.709> entire<00:03:26.160> sinkhole

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
basically just afk the entire sinkhole

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.720 
basically just afk the entire sinkhole
and<00:03:26.940> at<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:27.989> end<00:03:28.169> if<00:03:28.889> you<00:03:29.040> play<00:03:29.250> your<00:03:29.370> cards

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730

trading<00:04:09.090> leeches<00:04:09.419> cards<00:04:09.810> which<00:04:10.019> trades<00:04:11.090> your

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
trading leeches cards which trades your

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.390 
trading leeches cards which trades your
chests<00:04:12.599> with<00:04:13.019> the<00:04:13.349> player<00:04:13.769> that<00:04:13.949> is<00:04:14.099> behind

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
chests with the player that is behind

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.240 
chests with the player that is behind
you<00:04:14.819> not<00:04:15.720> the<00:04:15.959> player<00:04:16.229> that<00:04:16.590> is<00:04:16.739> in<00:04:16.919> front<00:04:17.070> of

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
you not the player that is in front of

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.979 
you not the player that is in front of
you<00:04:17.370> which<00:04:17.579> I<00:04:17.789> believed<00:04:18.090> but<00:04:18.359> I<00:04:18.389> did<00:04:18.659> not<00:04:18.780> read

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
you which I believed but I did not read

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.949 
you which I believed but I did not read
the<00:04:20.060> explanation<00:04:21.060> of<00:04:21.450> the<00:04:21.539> cards<00:04:21.779> correctly

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
the explanation of the cards correctly

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.990 
the explanation of the cards correctly
so<00:04:22.320> what<00:04:22.590> happens<00:04:22.979> is<00:04:23.250> the<00:04:23.490> guy<00:04:23.520> in<00:04:23.639> fifth

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
so what happens is the guy in fifth

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000 
so what happens is the guy in fifth
place<00:04:24.210> goes<00:04:24.419> first

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
place goes first

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.330 
place goes first
and<00:04:25.100> then<00:04:25.190> second<00:04:25.610> place<00:04:25.760> third<00:04:26.000> place<00:04:27.340> second

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
and then second place third place second

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.850 
and then second place third place second
place<00:04:28.400> first<00:04:28.760> place<00:04:28.820> so<00:04:29.510> the<00:04:29.930> cards<00:04:30.320> you<00:04:30.620> get

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
place first place so the cards you get

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.160 
place first place so the cards you get
them<00:04:31.100> during<00:04:31.550> the<00:04:31.670> dungeon<00:04:32.060> they're<00:04:32.750> found<00:04:33.020> in

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.170 
them during the dungeon they're found in

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.170 
them during the dungeon they're found in
treasure<00:04:33.440> chests<00:04:33.830> and<00:04:34.010> monsters<00:04:34.820> dropped

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
treasure chests and monsters dropped

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.350 
treasure chests and monsters dropped
them<00:04:35.360> as<00:04:35.510> well<00:04:35.750> so<00:04:36.250> they're<00:04:37.250> under<00:04:37.520> the<00:04:37.970> combat

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
them as well so they're under the combat

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.050 
them as well so they're under the combat
totems<00:04:38.750> when<00:04:38.930> you<00:04:39.020> kill<00:04:39.200> a<00:04:39.230> monster<00:04:39.470> so<00:04:40.370> you

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
totems when you kill a monster so you

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.720 
totems when you kill a monster so you
just<00:04:41.270> go<00:04:41.570> in<00:04:41.600> turn<00:04:42.170> and<00:04:42.470> everyone<00:04:42.830> uses<00:04:43.250> a<00:04:43.280> card

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
just go in turn and everyone uses a card

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.790 
just go in turn and everyone uses a card
I<00:04:44.000> don't<00:04:44.660> think<00:04:44.840> this<00:04:44.930> is<00:04:44.990> the<00:04:45.230> best<00:04:45.380> idea<00:04:45.620> I

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
I don't think this is the best idea I

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.680 
I don't think this is the best idea I
think<00:04:45.920> it<00:04:46.310> would<00:04:46.430> be<00:04:46.520> way<00:04:46.790> better<00:04:46.820> if<00:04:47.150> just

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
think it would be way better if just

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.080 
think it would be way better if just
whatever<00:04:48.080> place<00:04:48.470> you<00:04:48.710> were<00:04:48.830> in<00:04:49.090> automatically

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
whatever place you were in automatically

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.110 
whatever place you were in automatically
gave<00:04:50.390> you<00:04:50.540> that<00:04:50.750> reward<00:04:51.140> but<00:04:51.950> anyway<00:04:52.340> I<00:04:52.520> used

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
gave you that reward but anyway I used

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.820 
gave you that reward but anyway I used
the<00:04:53.330> trading<00:04:53.660> leech<00:04:53.780> card<00:04:54.080> so<00:04:54.260> I<00:04:54.290> traded<00:04:54.710> my

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
the trading leech card so I traded my

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.490 
the trading leech card so I traded my
large<00:04:55.220> lamp<00:04:55.550> for<00:04:55.970> a<00:04:56.030> small<00:04:56.390> lamp<00:04:56.660> which<00:04:56.900> wasn't

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
large lamp for a small lamp which wasn't

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.740 
large lamp for a small lamp which wasn't
the<00:04:57.620> best<00:04:57.860> idea<00:04:58.310> in<00:04:58.520> the<00:04:58.550> world

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
the best idea in the world

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.960 
the best idea in the world
but<00:05:00.260> anyway<00:05:00.590> that's<00:05:00.980> just<00:05:01.190> how<00:05:01.520> that<00:05:01.730> played

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
but anyway that's just how that played

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.900 
but anyway that's just how that played
out<00:05:02.000> I<00:05:02.980> wasn't<00:05:03.980> sure<00:05:04.220> what<00:05:04.340> I<00:05:04.400> was<00:05:04.520> doing<00:05:04.760> and<00:05:04.880> I

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
out I wasn't sure what I was doing and I

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.280 
out I wasn't sure what I was doing and I
just<00:05:05.120> wanted<00:05:05.330> to<00:05:05.420> use<00:05:05.600> a<00:05:05.630> card<00:05:05.930> for<00:05:06.080> the<00:05:06.140> sake

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
just wanted to use a card for the sake

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.770 
just wanted to use a card for the sake
of<00:05:06.320> the<00:05:06.470> video<00:05:06.590> but<00:05:07.100> in<00:05:07.280> the<00:05:07.400> future<00:05:07.760> I<00:05:07.910> do<00:05:08.600> not

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
of the video but in the future I do not

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.930 
of the video but in the future I do not
use<00:05:09.140> a<00:05:09.170> card<00:05:09.680> unless<00:05:10.100> you<00:05:10.280> actually<00:05:10.610> read<00:05:10.790> what

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
use a card unless you actually read what

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.150 
use a card unless you actually read what
it<00:05:11.030> does<00:05:11.210> that<00:05:11.840> certain<00:05:12.170> card<00:05:12.410> trades<00:05:12.800> the

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
it does that certain card trades the

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.270 
it does that certain card trades the
chest<00:05:13.460> with<00:05:13.640> the<00:05:13.760> player<00:05:14.000> and<00:05:14.330> the<00:05:15.280> standing

doing the sinkhole and then doing a
little<00:05:49.460> reward<00:05:49.670> minigame<00:05:50.300> it's<00:05:50.480> probably

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 
little reward minigame it's probably

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.230 
little reward minigame it's probably
only<00:05:50.990> about<00:05:51.080> 10<00:05:51.590> minutes<00:05:51.830> altogether<00:05:52.520> so<00:05:53.060> it

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 
only about 10 minutes altogether so it

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.210 
only about 10 minutes altogether so it
really<00:05:53.510> barely<00:05:53.810> takes<00:05:54.110> any<00:05:54.290> time<00:05:54.530> I<00:05:54.740> would

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:55.220 
really barely takes any time I would

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.370 
really barely takes any time I would
highly<00:05:55.670> recommend<00:05:55.700> doing<00:05:56.240> this<00:05:56.570> to<00:05:56.930> anyone

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:57.380 
highly recommend doing this to anyone

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.590 
highly recommend doing this to anyone

00:05:59.590 --> 00:05:59.600 
it's basically like the big chin Champa

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.300 
it's basically like the big chin Champa
of<00:05:59.750> dungeoneering<00:06:00.230> and<00:06:00.530> it's<00:06:00.710> actually<00:06:01.100> quite

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
of dungeoneering and it's actually quite

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:02.920 
of dungeoneering and it's actually quite
fun<00:06:01.490> so<00:06:02.030> that's<00:06:02.120> all<00:06:02.360> for<00:06:02.480> this<00:06:02.570> video<00:06:02.750> thanks
