the strings here starting on the a say

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.720 
the strings here starting on the a say
can<00:00:57.269> be<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.420> flat<00:00:58.460> immediately<00:00:59.460> we<00:00:59.580> have

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
can be a flat immediately we have

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.210 
can be a flat immediately we have
freedom<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.210> move<00:01:00.510> around<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.930> instrument

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
but for the time being we learn the a

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.680 
but for the time being we learn the a
chord<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:04.320> that's<00:01:05.309> using<00:01:05.610> three<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.090> four<00:01:06.360> as

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
chord and that's using three and four as

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.330 
chord and that's using three and four as
we<00:01:07.410> did<00:01:07.619> in<00:01:07.800> G<00:01:09.290> two<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.500> one<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:10.979> two

we did in G two and one and two

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.810 
we did in G two and one and two
we<00:01:11.880> go<00:01:12.030> three<00:01:12.300> and<00:01:12.330> four<00:01:12.600> like<00:01:12.810> this<00:01:13.580> so<00:01:14.580> we<00:01:14.670> got

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
we go three and four like this so we got

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.960 
we go three and four like this so we got
our<00:01:14.940> fourth<00:01:15.180> finger<00:01:15.570> on<00:01:15.770> an<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:17.100> note<00:01:17.550> which<00:01:17.789> is

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
our fourth finger on an a note which is

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.570 
our fourth finger on an a note which is
all<00:01:18.210> we<00:01:18.570> three<00:01:18.899> four<00:01:19.140> five<00:01:19.350> fifth<00:01:19.649> fret<00:01:22.580> third

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
all we three four five fifth fret third

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.510 
all we three four five fifth fret third
finger<00:01:23.850> on<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.420> C<00:01:24.750> sharp

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.069 

and<00:01:29.030> then<00:01:29.180> this<00:01:29.540> first<00:01:30.020> finger<00:01:31.689> really<00:01:32.689> it

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
and then this first finger really it

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.620 
and then this first finger really it
doesn't<00:01:33.350> have<00:01:33.439> to<00:01:33.530> be<00:01:33.649> straight<00:01:34.030> because<00:01:35.030> it

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
doesn't have to be straight because it

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.300 
doesn't have to be straight because it
can<00:01:35.840> be<00:01:35.960> on<00:01:36.079> an<00:01:36.200> angle<00:01:36.470> because<00:01:36.799> these<00:01:37.070> two

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
can be on an angle because these two

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.370 
can be on an angle because these two
three<00:01:38.180> and<00:01:38.330> four<00:01:38.540> are<00:01:38.659> taking<00:01:38.990> care<00:01:39.200> of<00:01:39.229> the
