00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 hello youtube friends in this video 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:10.660
 tutorial I'm going to teach you a topic of 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:14.049
 windows 8 for for windows 7 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:16.080
 ready to start be to the description 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:20.420
 of the video 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.420
 and they are going to copy this link 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.960
 go to 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:35.440
 they are going to paste it in the url bar 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:37.790
 grab links we wait for the 25 seconds 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.430
 and let's go 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.890
 will be a folder of yes but a 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.590
 real file but I recommend that you 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:50.440
 Do not keep a folder because there are several 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.440
 lean files is to bring here 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:01.360
 so 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:04.570
 as has already been seen here 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:07.000
 the extracted files then the subject 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.700
 is here then and the only thing they are going to 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.540
 do is select the east and this 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:16.120
 binder 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.120
 copy they take it to the team 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.909
 local disk set 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:24.979
 windows 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.979
 they are going to look for the folder red source 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:32.659
 this month's challenges are here and what 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.430
 they are going to hit what they had 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.149
 cancel because I already had it then 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.149
 when they have stuck 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.350
 give right click customize since 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.020
 go to do 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.909
 and how do they see it since it appears windows 8 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.710
 floating 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.710
 let's wait for him to put on 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:59.310
 and keep it up because I have my football has 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:01.080
 activated but already the race 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.890
 already 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:08.240
 Well, this is the issue, but not what 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:11.710
 makes it look more bacano are the 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.710
 for example gold 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.950
 and all this to put it on and all that 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.470
 for example the faces is where the 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.120
 folders 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.020
 this is to be done by the 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.240
 folders for for example I'm like this 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.530
 like to make the folders like that but 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.530
 this is another way 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.540
 and so 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.060
 this is the gold 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.519
 with this 9 with this you need a 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.940
 program to change this button that 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.940
 is here 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.209
 Well then that's all I hope that 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:58.130

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:02.140

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.140
