00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello to everyone here is a video for you 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.509
 nail art collection in this video vi 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.730
 I will show the realization of this 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.950
 tutorial that is very particular in 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.599
 how much we will use the piercings anyway 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.150
 for nails that you will find in the exit 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.770
 itself and not on the ring finger 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.869
 the medium as you see I did a little 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.270
 decor because in any case already the piercings 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.060
 they already have their value if it makes you 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.410
 pleasure follow the tutorial 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.180
 first let's apply one 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.160
 base I remind you that the base always goes 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.720
 mass protects the nail from the color 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.390
 next making it not 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.860
 see the nail staining each base 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.469
 at its function this is a basis 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.120
 reinforcer dries very quickly 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:41.370
 so always remember always to 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.820
 apply it even to your advantage 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.379
 of your umbria the passage 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.600
 next is to take the color 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.190
 of the exit that will be white and it 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.680
 stand one- color fingers over the entire nail 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.840
 you have to give a lot in the drafts 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.149
 thin cover the lateral tips well 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.370
 let the enamel dry well and then give 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.989
 however the second pass is a lot 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.090
 important because the second pass 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.510
 will outline the best define the 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.700
 all 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.350
 so if the first one didn't come perfect 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.479
 don't worry that there will always be the 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.439
 second the white a little difficult to 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.810
 to apply 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.330
 so be very light with la con la 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.490
 hand with the brush when we pass on 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.200
 surface because it has a little mangy 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.119
 after which we expect really good that 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.490
 the glaze dries up but we take 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.780
 to the glitter ace of the past releases e 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.640
 let's go to make small nuances 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.549
 side as you see from the image 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.740
 we do it on all nails and if you do 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.869
 a case you like something more intense 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.869
 we still expect ashley and 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.920
 then let's take the second pass 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:41.939
 I only half-nail because 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.680
 in the other half will put a sticker now 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.920
 we take these stickers and those with 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.280
 pink decoration and we are going to apply it on the 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.570
 empty side that is left of the nail 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.490
 precisely we apply it as you wish 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.009
 April , however, we apply this yes 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.320
 that on all the nails I on the little finger and 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.540
 the ring finger I attached this sticker to 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.430
 this size shape on the other three 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.220
 red nails or grips that a little more 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.260
 great 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.510
 it's a bit bigger than I always put it 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.440
 side we press well to make it stick 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.440
 perfectly on the surface 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.010
 as you see this one instead the more 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.420
 great that will be applied anyway 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.910
 on the other nails always with the same 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.590
 the same way we have the form 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.210
 lobby we already apply it more or less 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.190
 at the same point of all nails 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.720
 spades we are good to make it join 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.820
 perfectly on the surface 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.280
 now let's take our sandwich between that 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.350
 there will be an exit and let's just start at 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.670
 pierce our fingernail gently 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:38.890
 for they do not forgive does evil and two for 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.500
 do not pierce gold break it myself 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.240
 then gently we go to turn 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.520
 just as if it were a trapani it is not 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.670
 long until this hole is better 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.800
 do it just for the reasons you have 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.140
 I said before so there were holes in them 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.720
 holes until the drills do not pass 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.390
 from side to side of your nail 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.360
 we pass it slightly to enlarge the 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.070
 hole once the hole is enlarged you must 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.620
 however just attack the piercing 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.390
 intensive is composed of a ring e 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.680
 then the cross we chose precisely 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.570
 with those who have rhinestones 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.400
 so once the hole is done I will 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.290
 I advise you to take the tweezers there 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.480
 will help to insert this 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.790
 ring that already opened in the house there 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.250
 pass you can enlarge it more once 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.840
 that you have inserted it we take care of it excused 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.300
 once you have entered it we put 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.519
 the cross after putting the cross there 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.769
 well close well well well well well well 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:32.200
 tight to avoid losing it 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:34.150
 cross then we have finished 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.519
 attached our piercing vi 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.230
 I recommend the split to turn it and 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.480
 make it end up under the nail at least not 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.340
 you notice it and in any case despite being 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.280
 reusable as you once are 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.680
 fed up you can widen to avellino e 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.630
 store it and use another time 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.060
 you just have to pay attention anyway 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.280
 when you go around that in the clubs the 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.750
 nail art once we go we go 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.430
 apply the top coat over the whole 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.580
 nail surface to protect 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:03.840
 precisely the rai side made and make it last 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.840
 longer the enamel 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.630
 we wait for the enamel to be 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:11.400
 completely dry before 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.400
 proceed using our hands 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.980
 this is the end result of the nail 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.170
 art I really hope my idea of 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.610
 ice therefore who is particular vi 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.620
 also like using piercings 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.250
 next video a big hug everyone 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.000
 How many 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.000
