00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
I mean I I honestly don't think that the

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.550 
I mean I I honestly don't think that the
three<00:02:14.370> issues<00:02:14.520> have<00:02:15.030> been<00:02:15.270> as<00:02:15.960> sweet<00:02:16.200> as<00:02:16.380> the

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
three issues have been as sweet as the

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.590 
three issues have been as sweet as the
originals<00:02:16.950> okay<00:02:17.400> but<00:02:17.910> for<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.180> money<00:02:18.360> they're

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
originals okay but for the money they're

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.210 
originals okay but for the money they're
not<00:02:18.750> a<00:02:18.780> super<00:02:19.110> expensive<00:02:19.380> amp<00:02:19.770> they're<00:02:19.920> still

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
not a super expensive amp they're still

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.000 
not a super expensive amp they're still
sounded<00:02:20.550> pretty<00:02:20.700> good<00:02:20.820> okay

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
sounded pretty good okay

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.170 
sounded pretty good okay
they're<00:02:23.010> not<00:02:23.190> inserted<00:02:23.670> they<00:02:23.790> weren't<00:02:24.000> like

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
they're not inserted they weren't like

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.820 
they're not inserted they weren't like
100<00:02:24.690> percent<00:02:24.990> the<00:02:25.770> same<00:02:27.530> because<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.680> old

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
100 percent the same because the old

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.580 
100 percent the same because the old
ones<00:02:29.070> are<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.220> point-to-point<00:02:29.670> wiring<00:02:30.360> in<00:02:31.200> the

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
ones are a point-to-point wiring in the

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.740 
ones are a point-to-point wiring in the
amp<00:02:31.770> and<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.130> reissues<00:02:32.730> were<00:02:32.880> like<00:02:33.090> some

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
amp and the reissues were like some

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.010 
amp and the reissues were like some
circuit<00:02:34.080> boards<00:02:34.290> refused<00:02:34.770> up<00:02:35.780> so<00:02:36.780> I<00:02:36.840> think

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
circuit boards refused up so I think

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.130 
circuit boards refused up so I think
they<00:02:37.140> were<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.880> little<00:02:38.880> bit<00:02:39.090> yeah<00:02:39.870> there<00:02:39.990> was<00:02:40.110> a

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
they were a little bit yeah there was a

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.390 
they were a little bit yeah there was a
little<00:02:40.290> something<00:02:40.680> that<00:02:40.710> wasn't<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.160> same

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
little something that wasn't the same

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.000 
little something that wasn't the same
yeah<00:02:41.760> yeah<00:02:42.060> okay<00:02:42.390> an<00:02:42.930> ampeg<00:02:43.380> amps<00:02:43.710> though<00:02:43.830> but

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
yeah yeah okay an ampeg amps though but

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.370 
yeah yeah okay an ampeg amps though but
they're<00:02:44.330> they<00:02:45.330> have<00:02:45.480> a<00:02:45.510> lot<00:02:45.750> of<00:02:45.870> classic<00:02:46.230> amps

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
they're they have a lot of classic amps

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.890 
they're they have a lot of classic amps
from<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.650> 60s<00:02:47.040> so<00:02:47.220> they<00:02:47.370> eventually<00:02:47.580> in<00:02:48.030> in

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
from the 60s so they eventually in in

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.070 
from the 60s so they eventually in in
the<00:02:49.050> past<00:02:49.970> ten<00:02:50.970> years<00:02:51.000> or<00:02:51.390> so<00:02:51.540> they<00:02:51.690> start<00:02:52.020> at

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
the past ten years or so they start at

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.010 
the past ten years or so they start at
reissue<00:02:52.470> some<00:02:52.800> of<00:02:52.920> them<00:02:53.040> huh<00:02:54.090> let's<00:02:54.480> go<00:02:54.630> in<00:02:54.840> the

the anthems have kind of a different

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.640 
the anthems have kind of a different
thing<00:03:01.800> that<00:03:02.100> they<00:03:02.250> do<00:03:02.310> very<00:03:03.290> cool<00:03:04.290> all<00:03:04.590> right

here I've got a rat and two lab Sparkle

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.920 
here I've got a rat and two lab Sparkle
drives<00:03:16.670> for<00:03:17.670> distortion<00:03:18.450> and<00:03:18.630> then<00:03:18.720> I<00:03:18.750> have

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
drives for distortion and then I have

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.550 
drives for distortion and then I have
another<00:03:19.050> rat<00:03:19.500> here<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.760> rack<00:03:20.940> mounted<00:03:21.530> so<00:03:22.530> I

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
another rat here the rack mounted so I

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.190 
another rat here the rack mounted so I
and<00:03:22.830> then<00:03:22.980> I<00:03:23.070> and<00:03:23.340> I<00:03:23.519> have<00:03:23.730> a<00:03:23.760> g-force<00:03:24.360> a<00:03:24.750> TC

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
and then I and I have a g-force a TC

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.430 
and then I and I have a g-force a TC
electronic<00:03:25.680> g-force<00:03:26.330> multi<00:03:27.330> effects<00:03:27.780> you've

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
electronic g-force multi effects you've

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.880 
electronic g-force multi effects you've
had<00:03:28.560> that<00:03:28.709> for<00:03:28.890> a<00:03:28.920> while<00:03:28.980> yeah<00:03:29.580> and<00:03:29.940> so<00:03:30.739> you<00:03:31.739> can

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
had that for a while yeah and so you can

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.040 
had that for a while yeah and so you can
patch<00:03:32.100> um<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.970> a<00:03:33.000> tens<00:03:33.330> and<00:03:33.480> eight<00:03:33.600> outs<00:03:33.810> and

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
patch um the a tens and eight outs and

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.660 
patch um the a tens and eight outs and
you<00:03:34.170> can<00:03:34.290> take<00:03:34.470> any<00:03:34.620> of<00:03:34.769> your<00:03:34.920> you<00:03:35.100> can<00:03:35.220> do<00:03:35.310> any

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
you can take any of your you can do any

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:36.860 
you can take any of your you can do any
of<00:03:35.700> your<00:03:35.850> effects<00:03:36.120> in<00:03:36.269> any<00:03:36.450> order<00:03:36.720> that<00:03:36.750> you

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
of your effects in any order that you

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.440 
of your effects in any order that you
want<00:03:37.110> so<00:03:37.440> it'll<00:03:37.650> switch<00:03:37.890> and<00:03:38.250> in<00:03:38.880> parallel<00:03:39.150> or

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
want so it'll switch and in parallel or

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.770 
want so it'll switch and in parallel or
series<00:03:39.870> oh<00:03:40.230> cool<00:03:40.860> okay<00:03:41.250> so<00:03:41.580> it<00:03:42.180> adds<00:03:42.450> a<00:03:42.570> lot<00:03:42.720> of

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
series oh cool okay so it adds a lot of

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.509 
series oh cool okay so it adds a lot of
flexibility<00:03:43.410> you<00:03:43.800> can<00:03:43.860> run<00:03:44.190> you<00:03:44.489> know

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
flexibility you can run you know

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.120 
flexibility you can run you know
distortions<00:03:45.510> in<00:03:45.660> different<00:03:45.959> order<00:03:46.320> i<00:03:46.530> Kara

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
distortions in different order i Kara

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.440 
distortions in different order i Kara
might<00:03:47.400> you<00:03:47.580> know<00:03:47.700> I<00:03:47.910> want<00:03:48.060> to<00:03:48.090> go<00:03:48.180> into<00:03:48.330> the

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
might you know I want to go into the

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.150 
might you know I want to go into the
distortion<00:03:48.989> that<00:03:49.140> ensure<00:03:49.470> the<00:03:49.590> delay<00:03:49.890> then

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
distortion that ensure the delay then

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.340 
distortion that ensure the delay then
back<00:03:50.310> into<00:03:50.550> another<00:03:50.730> distortion<00:03:51.450> okay<00:03:52.140> right

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
back into another distortion okay right

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.600 
back into another distortion okay right
I<00:03:52.380> run<00:03:52.590> into<00:03:52.830> that<00:03:52.890> distortion<00:03:53.489> that

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
I run into that distortion that

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.400 
I run into that distortion that
distortion<00:03:54.150> then<00:03:54.300> delay<00:03:55.400> and<00:03:56.900> it<00:03:57.900> lets<00:03:58.170> you<00:03:58.290> do

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
distortion then delay and it lets you do

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:59.990 
distortion then delay and it lets you do
it<00:03:58.560> because<00:03:59.010> of<00:03:59.160> the<00:03:59.220> flexibility<00:03:59.760> it<00:03:59.850> lets

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
it because of the flexibility it lets
