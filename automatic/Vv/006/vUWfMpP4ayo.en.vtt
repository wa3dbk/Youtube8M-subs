00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:10.650
 can I eat macaroni and lose weight 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.870
 say nutritionists but only for this 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.030
 they must be made of solid 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.080
 wheat varieties for those who want to reduce 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.029
 pasta weight 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.730
 you can use pasta from solid 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.830
 wheat varieties since in them 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.320
 contains more protein and it slows down 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.099
 carbohydrate absorption and less increase 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.740
 blood sugar 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.630
 better to eat and pasta in a small 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.230
 quantity that is, it is approximately worth 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.820
 100 150 grams in combination with vegetables and 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.620
 Ideal is the first half 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.780
 of the day it can be breakfast or 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.300
 lunch but how to understand from which wheat 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.730
 Some made the crown 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.950
 this can be determined by eye and ostensibly 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.190
 pasta from durum smooth and 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.930
 vitreous and soft varieties 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.730
 rough actually not visually 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.559
 one specialist will not determine the soft 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.940
 wheat or solid technology 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.280
 making crowns in fact now 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.199
 such that it tastes great from 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.770
 me to wheat varum then on modern 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.080
 equipment 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.049
 no different from macaroni 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.600
 group products and accomplishments and determine 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.460
 it can only be chemically not so 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.920
 understand what wheat is made of 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.229
 Pasta them make electrophoresis 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.960
 soft wheat proteins move slowly 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.450
 solid more mobile we sent on 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.320
 examination of pasta 10 brands and 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.390
 found out 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.350
 soft wheat is added to pasta 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.900
 pasta zara 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.060
 donguz something and taste of villas abroad 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.020
 use is prohibited by law 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.320
 soft wheat 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.430
 that is, for example, the laws of Italy and France 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.840
 prohibits the manufacturer to produce 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.820
 wheat pasta sign 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.979
 allow only from solid on for them 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.259
 this is our law because solid 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.540
 wheat grows small and 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.490
 cultivate hard our manufacturers 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.350
 they are generally kind of forced 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.170
 produce pasta from flour 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.270
 common wheat in our country is allowed 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.310
 add to pasta dough 15 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.680
 percent soft wheat and at the same time 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.049
 write on durum label 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.049
 what actually pasta differ from 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.909
 hard and soft wheat varieties 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.920
 soft products 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.200
 from bread flour well this is essentially 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.690
 white bread the same buns only in 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.670
 another form and I as a consumer 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.340
 Naturally right to know what I buy 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.489
 or buy from the crown or I buy 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.250
 flour product durum wheat contains 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.650
 slightly more protein amino acid 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.830
 its composition is more favorable and the most 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.860
 the main thing is that the starch grains in solid 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.299
 wheat have a slightly different configuration 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.959
 so it is absorbed a little slower 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:37.760
 so pasta are real groups a of 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.099
 Durum wheat are considered more 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.650
 useful for body shape and health 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.200
 whole what pasta really is 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.860
 made from durum wheat 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.360
 look at the site 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.360
