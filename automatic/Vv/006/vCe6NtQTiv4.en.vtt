back down and it sounds like this you

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.050 
back down and it sounds like this you
can<00:01:04.949> probably<00:01:05.070> tell<00:01:05.430> I'm<00:01:05.610> not<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.820> very<00:01:05.970> good

not the better that's a better

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.070 
not the better that's a better
representation<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.420> what<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.630> technique

actually<00:01:49.680> do<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.040> lip<00:01:50.220> personing<00:01:50.720> and<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:52.200> way

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
actually do it lip personing and the way

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.590 
actually do it lip personing and the way
you<00:01:52.380> do<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.890> is<00:01:53.100> basically<00:01:53.940> it's<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.420> same

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
you do it is basically it's the same

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.980 
you do it is basically it's the same
idea<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.050> you<00:01:56.210> take<00:01:57.210> your<00:01:57.479> one<00:01:57.720> hole<00:01:57.960> that

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
idea you you take your one hole that

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.810 
idea you you take your one hole that
you're<00:01:58.259> playing<00:01:58.470> you<00:01:59.160> widen<00:01:59.490> your<00:01:59.520> end<00:01:59.729> be

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
you're playing you widen your end be

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.910 
you're playing you widen your end be
sure<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:00.660> get<00:02:00.900> the<00:02:01.440> holes<00:02:01.650> on<00:02:01.800> either

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
sure and you get the holes on either

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.890 
sure and you get the holes on either
side<00:02:02.190> so<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.580> get<00:02:02.790> in<00:02:02.940> this<00:02:03.360> case<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.750> stuff

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
side so and get in this case and stuff

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.660 
side so and get in this case and stuff
lifting<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.320> tongue<00:02:04.530> up<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:05.190> getting<00:02:05.550> these

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
lifting the tongue up and getting these

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.120 
lifting the tongue up and getting these
tools<00:02:06.119> down<00:02:06.300> here<00:02:06.660> you've<00:02:07.200> got<00:02:07.380> your<00:02:07.410> sort<00:02:08.070> of

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
tools down here you've got your sort of

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.249 
tools down here you've got your sort of
punker<00:02:08.759> playing<00:02:09.209> for<00:02:09.479> example<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.869> two<00:02:10.020> hole

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
punker playing for example the two hole

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.770 
punker playing for example the two hole
you<00:02:10.740> just<00:02:10.950> why<00:02:11.160> not<00:02:11.430> your<00:02:11.640> mouth<00:02:11.850> like<00:02:12.540> that

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
you just why not your mouth like that

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.780 
you just why not your mouth like that
and<00:02:13.380> you<00:02:13.470> get<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.830> one<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.220> three<00:02:14.519> on<00:02:14.670> either

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
and you get the one and three on either

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:21.530 
and you get the one and three on either
side<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.300> it<00:02:15.420> sounds<00:02:15.690> like<00:02:15.810> this

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.880 

it's<00:02:22.540> very<00:02:22.720> similar<00:02:23.020> you<00:02:23.350> can<00:02:23.470> even<00:02:23.620> actually

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
it's very similar you can even actually

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.590 
it's very similar you can even actually
if<00:02:24.190> you're<00:02:24.370> quick<00:02:24.790> enough<00:02:24.910> you<00:02:25.030> can<00:02:25.330> actually

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
if you're quick enough you can actually

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.960 
if you're quick enough you can actually
play<00:02:25.840> to<00:02:26.320> one<00:02:26.530> side<00:02:26.770> so<00:02:27.310> if<00:02:27.430> I'm<00:02:27.580> playing<00:02:27.790> on

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
play to one side so if I'm playing on

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:28.620 
play to one side so if I'm playing on
the<00:02:28.000> three<00:02:28.240> hall

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
the three hall

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.890 
the three hall
I<00:02:28.740> can<00:02:29.740> actually<00:02:29.890> probably<00:02:30.370> just<00:02:31.180> open<00:02:31.480> up<00:02:31.600> the

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
I can actually probably just open up the

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.420 
I can actually probably just open up the
left<00:02:32.230> side<00:02:32.410> of<00:02:32.530> it<00:02:32.620> off<00:02:32.740> and<00:02:32.800> get<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.130> one<00:02:33.280> and

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
left side of it off and get the one and

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.810 
left side of it off and get the one and
two<00:02:36.990> so<00:02:37.990> in<00:02:38.320> fact<00:02:38.560> you<00:02:38.680> can<00:02:38.830> actually<00:02:38.860> mimic

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
two so in fact you can actually mimic

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.540 
two so in fact you can actually mimic
the<00:02:40.030> tongue<00:02:40.240> block<00:02:40.510> lips<00:02:41.230> slap<00:02:41.470> sorry<00:02:42.340> at<00:02:42.460> the

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
the tongue block lips slap sorry at the

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.030 
the tongue block lips slap sorry at the
tongue<00:02:43.120> slap<00:02:43.420> with<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:43.750> lip<00:02:43.900> slap<00:02:44.140> so<00:02:44.800> it's

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
tongue slap with the lip slap so it's

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.060 
tongue slap with the lip slap so it's
almost<00:02:45.340> identical<00:02:45.580> and<00:02:46.710> how<00:02:47.710> would<00:02:47.920> you<00:02:48.040> use

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
almost identical and how would you use

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.360 
almost identical and how would you use
it<00:02:48.310> well<00:02:49.320> if<00:02:50.320> you're<00:02:50.500> playing<00:02:50.740> a<00:02:50.890> slow<00:02:51.130> blues

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
it well if you're playing a slow blues

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.300 
it well if you're playing a slow blues
you<00:02:51.730> would<00:02:51.880> probably<00:02:52.360> put<00:02:52.600> it<00:02:52.720> as<00:02:53.590> an<00:02:53.830> accent

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
you would probably put it as an accent

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:04.980 
you would probably put it as an accent
between<00:02:54.520> us<00:02:54.880> so<00:02:55.150> you<00:02:55.209> go<00:03:02.610> so<00:03:03.610> that's<00:03:04.570> one<00:03:04.810> way

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
between us so you go so that's one way

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.140 
between us so you go so that's one way
if<00:03:05.350> you're<00:03:05.560> playing<00:03:05.890> some<00:03:06.790> kind<00:03:07.000> of

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
if you're playing some kind of

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:24.260 
if you're playing some kind of
boogie-woogie<00:03:07.750> or<00:03:08.050> something

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.180 

every<00:03:25.270> time<00:03:25.569> you<00:03:25.900> hear<00:03:26.080> that<00:03:26.260> sort<00:03:26.590> of<00:03:26.709> chord

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
every time you hear that sort of chord

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.309 
every time you hear that sort of chord
blast<00:03:27.520> that's<00:03:27.970> me<00:03:28.150> opening<00:03:28.750> my<00:03:28.810> embouchure<00:03:29.050> a

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
blast that's me opening my embouchure a

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:36.870 
blast that's me opening my embouchure a
little<00:03:29.590> bit<00:03:34.500> anyway<00:03:35.500> that's<00:03:35.980> uh<00:03:36.130> and<00:03:36.670> so<00:03:36.819> you

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
little bit anyway that's uh and so you

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.699 
little bit anyway that's uh and so you
don't<00:03:37.209> have<00:03:37.450> to<00:03:37.540> do<00:03:37.660> it<00:03:37.780> as<00:03:37.900> a<00:03:37.930> slab<00:03:38.200> you<00:03:38.410> can<00:03:38.590> do

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
don't have to do it as a slab you can do

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.220 
don't have to do it as a slab you can do
it<00:03:38.830> as<00:03:38.920> a<00:03:39.010> pull<00:03:39.420> so<00:03:40.420> a<00:03:40.450> slap<00:03:40.720> is<00:03:40.930> where<00:03:41.110> you

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
it as a pull so a slap is where you

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.080 
it as a pull so a slap is where you
attack<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:41.860> note<00:03:42.069> with<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:42.580> cord<00:03:42.880> and<00:03:42.970> you

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
attack the note with the cord and you

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:49.640 
attack the note with the cord and you
narrow<00:03:43.300> down<00:03:43.360> into<00:03:44.200> the<00:03:44.410> single<00:03:45.100> note<00:03:45.519> so<00:03:45.790> you

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.350 

can<00:03:50.650> actually<00:03:50.920> do<00:03:51.010> it<00:03:51.130> as<00:03:51.250> a<00:03:51.280> as<00:03:51.640> a<00:03:51.700> pool<00:03:52.120> so

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
can actually do it as a as a pool so

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.640 
can actually do it as a as a pool so
that'd<00:03:52.540> be<00:03:52.690> like<00:03:52.870> where<00:03:53.080> you<00:03:53.170> start<00:03:53.470> with<00:03:53.590> a

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
that'd be like where you start with a

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.259 
that'd be like where you start with a
single<00:03:53.830> note<00:03:54.069> and<00:03:54.250> then<00:03:54.340> you<00:03:54.370> open<00:03:54.700> up<00:03:55.060> into

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
single note and then you open up into

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:03.900 
single note and then you open up into
the<00:03:55.390> chord<00:03:59.160> and<00:04:02.340> then<00:04:03.340> when<00:04:03.489> you<00:04:03.610> you<00:04:03.880> know

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
the chord and then when you you know

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.100 
the chord and then when you you know
when<00:04:04.030> you're<00:04:04.360> doing<00:04:04.600> it<00:04:04.690> between<00:04:04.959> notes

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
when you're doing it between notes

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.539 
when you're doing it between notes
you're<00:04:05.290> kind<00:04:05.470> of<00:04:05.530> doing<00:04:05.769> both<00:04:06.010> of<00:04:06.310> them

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
you're kind of doing both of them

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:12.300 
you're kind of doing both of them
together<00:04:06.730> a<00:04:06.970> slap<00:04:07.810> and<00:04:07.989> a<00:04:08.049> full<00:04:11.069> anyway<00:04:12.069> I<00:04:12.190> just

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
together a slap and a full anyway I just

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.940 
together a slap and a full anyway I just
thought<00:04:12.580> I'd<00:04:12.790> make<00:04:12.970> a<00:04:13.000> quick<00:04:13.090> video<00:04:13.709> show<00:04:14.709> how

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
thought I'd make a quick video show how

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.770 
thought I'd make a quick video show how
I<00:04:15.010> do<00:04:15.160> that<00:04:15.519> technique<00:04:15.760> and<00:04:16.269> how<00:04:16.359> it<00:04:16.510> can<00:04:16.660> be

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
I do that technique and how it can be

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.719 
I do that technique and how it can be
used<00:04:17.579> really<00:04:18.579> like<00:04:19.359> I<00:04:19.690> think<00:04:20.500> the<00:04:21.010> moderate

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
used really like I think the moderate

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.400 
used really like I think the moderate
side<00:04:22.030> of<00:04:22.210> the<00:04:22.270> debate<00:04:22.570> is<00:04:22.810> that<00:04:23.020> it<00:04:23.260> really

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
side of the debate is that it really

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.409 
side of the debate is that it really
doesn't<00:04:23.800> matter<00:04:23.919> whether<00:04:24.220> you<00:04:24.490> let<00:04:24.910> purse<00:04:25.180> or

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
doesn't matter whether you let purse or

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:29.250 
doesn't matter whether you let purse or
you<00:04:26.460> tongue<00:04:27.460> block<00:04:27.700> as<00:04:28.539> long<00:04:28.780> as<00:04:28.930> it's<00:04:29.110> what

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
you tongue block as long as it's what

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.450 
you tongue block as long as it's what
you're<00:04:29.410> comfortable<00:04:29.620> with<00:04:29.860> and<00:04:29.919> what<00:04:30.190> gives

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
you're comfortable with and what gives

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.070 
you're comfortable with and what gives
you<00:04:30.550> the<00:04:30.669> sound<00:04:30.880> you<00:04:31.060> want<00:04:31.240> to<00:04:31.300> hear<00:04:31.360> there's

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
you the sound you want to hear there's

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.050 
you the sound you want to hear there's
very<00:04:32.380> few<00:04:32.470> techniques<00:04:33.280> that<00:04:33.460> you<00:04:33.669> actually

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
very few techniques that you actually

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.029 
very few techniques that you actually
can't<00:04:34.330> translate<00:04:34.810> between<00:04:35.020> them<00:04:35.350> in<00:04:35.740> fact<00:04:35.860> I

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.039 
can't translate between them in fact I

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:37.680 
can't translate between them in fact I
think<00:04:36.100> probably<00:04:36.400> the<00:04:36.640> only<00:04:36.940> technique<00:04:37.360> that

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
think probably the only technique that

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:38.969 
think probably the only technique that
at<00:04:37.840> least<00:04:38.020> I<00:04:38.140> got<00:04:38.320> and<00:04:38.560> found<00:04:38.710> a<00:04:38.800> way<00:04:38.919> to

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
at least I got and found a way to

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:43.140 
at least I got and found a way to
translate<00:04:39.460> between<00:04:39.910> them<00:04:40.090> is<00:04:40.330> the<00:04:42.150> tongue

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
translate between them is the tongue

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:48.580 
translate between them is the tongue
split<00:04:43.510> octaves<00:04:43.990> and<00:04:44.140> intervals

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.560 

you're<00:04:49.590> playing<00:04:49.860> in<00:04:50.040> that<00:04:50.190> case<00:04:50.430> two<00:04:50.910> slightly

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
you're playing in that case two slightly

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.150 
you're playing in that case two slightly
separated<00:04:52.170> holes<00:04:52.440> with<00:04:52.650> your<00:04:52.680> tongue<00:04:52.950> in<00:04:53.100> the

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
separated holes with your tongue in the

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.670 
separated holes with your tongue in the
middle<00:04:53.400> would<00:04:53.880> be<00:04:53.940> very<00:04:54.240> difficult<00:04:54.450> for<00:04:54.780> you

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
middle would be very difficult for you

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.930 
middle would be very difficult for you
to<00:04:55.710> probably<00:04:56.040> play<00:04:56.190> that<00:04:57.620> lip<00:04:58.620> first<00:04:58.940> other

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
to probably play that lip first other

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.940 
to probably play that lip first other
than<00:05:00.210> that<00:05:00.420> I<00:05:00.720> don't<00:05:01.170> really<00:05:01.500> see<00:05:01.770> any

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
than that I don't really see any

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.710 
than that I don't really see any
difference<00:05:02.250> between<00:05:02.370> the<00:05:02.790> tone<00:05:03.030> to<00:05:03.330> me<00:05:03.450> is<00:05:03.600> the

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
difference between the tone to me is the

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:14.300 
difference between the tone to me is the
same

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.140 

you<00:05:15.310> probably<00:05:15.580> didn't<00:05:15.760> hear<00:05:15.820> any<00:05:15.970> difference

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
you probably didn't hear any difference

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.640 
you probably didn't hear any difference
that's<00:05:16.540> because<00:05:16.900> there<00:05:17.110> wasn't<00:05:17.440> any

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
that's because there wasn't any

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:18.810 
that's because there wasn't any
difference<00:05:17.980> except<00:05:18.310> I<00:05:18.460> was<00:05:18.640> actually

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
difference except I was actually

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.990 
difference except I was actually
switching<00:05:19.300> between<00:05:19.420> tongue<00:05:19.870> blocking<00:05:20.080> and

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
switching between tongue blocking and

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.600 
switching between tongue blocking and
puckering<00:05:22.000> for<00:05:22.510> whole<00:05:22.720> drop<00:05:22.990> on<00:05:23.290> on<00:05:24.040> that<00:05:24.280> and

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
puckering for whole drop on on that and

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.850 
puckering for whole drop on on that and
to<00:05:24.850> me<00:05:24.970> there's<00:05:25.300> no<00:05:25.510> difference<00:05:25.540> in<00:05:26.050> tone<00:05:26.290> it's

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
to me there's no difference in tone it's

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.740 
to me there's no difference in tone it's
all<00:05:27.010> about<00:05:27.250> how<00:05:27.490> you<00:05:27.550> open<00:05:28.000> up<00:05:28.090> your<00:05:28.240> mouth<00:05:28.420> and

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
all about how you open up your mouth and

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.680 
all about how you open up your mouth and
your<00:05:29.280> your<00:05:30.280> chest<00:05:30.700> cavity<00:05:31.180> and<00:05:31.210> your<00:05:31.450> throat

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
your your chest cavity and your throat

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.570 
your your chest cavity and your throat
and<00:05:31.870> stuff<00:05:32.110> when<00:05:32.320> you<00:05:32.410> play<00:05:32.620> and<00:05:33.130> you<00:05:33.400> can

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
and stuff when you play and you can

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:39.230 
and stuff when you play and you can
actually<00:05:33.760> change<00:05:34.180> the<00:05:34.510> tone<00:05:34.690> of<00:05:34.720> a<00:05:34.990> note

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.180 

that's<00:05:40.240> just<00:05:40.540> me<00:05:40.720> opening<00:05:41.500> up<00:05:41.650> the<00:05:41.860> inside<00:05:42.160> of

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
that's just me opening up the inside of

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.580 
that's just me opening up the inside of
my<00:05:42.430> mouth<00:05:42.660> and<00:05:43.660> so<00:05:43.870> I<00:05:43.900> think<00:05:44.020> people<00:05:44.290> probably

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:44.590 
my mouth and so I think people probably

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.640 
my mouth and so I think people probably
like<00:05:45.190> to<00:05:45.340> think<00:05:45.580> that<00:05:45.930> the<00:05:46.930> tongue<00:05:47.140> Bach<00:05:47.380> tone

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
like to think that the tongue Bach tone

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.650 
like to think that the tongue Bach tone
is<00:05:47.890> thicker<00:05:48.520> or<00:05:48.790> better<00:05:49.000> or<00:05:49.120> something<00:05:49.540> like

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:49.660 
is thicker or better or something like

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.870 
is thicker or better or something like
that<00:05:49.930> it's<00:05:50.200> nothing<00:05:50.830> to<00:05:51.070> do<00:05:51.250> really<00:05:51.460> with<00:05:51.640> the

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 
that it's nothing to do really with the

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.670 
that it's nothing to do really with the
tongue<00:05:52.060> blocking<00:05:52.420> other<00:05:52.540> than<00:05:52.780> that<00:05:52.990> kind<00:05:53.650> of

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
tongue blocking other than that kind of

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.560 
tongue blocking other than that kind of
forces<00:05:54.070> your<00:05:54.220> mouth<00:05:54.400> and<00:05:54.670> back<00:05:55.300> of<00:05:55.450> your

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
forces your mouth and back of your

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:57.690 
forces your mouth and back of your
throat<00:05:55.660> to<00:05:55.870> be<00:05:55.960> open<00:05:56.260> a<00:05:56.320> little<00:05:56.470> bit<00:05:56.560> more<00:05:56.830> but

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:57.700 
throat to be open a little bit more but

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.340 
throat to be open a little bit more but
you<00:05:57.820> can<00:05:57.940> do<00:05:58.060> that<00:05:58.210> just<00:05:58.360> fine<00:05:58.570> with<00:05:58.840> lip

00:05:59.340 --> 00:05:59.350 
you can do that just fine with lip

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:01.860 
you can do that just fine with lip
piercing<00:05:59.790> in<00:06:00.790> effect<00:06:01.180> you<00:06:01.300> can<00:06:01.450> actually<00:06:01.600> eat

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870 
piercing in effect you can actually eat

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.480 
piercing in effect you can actually eat
more<00:06:02.080> easily<00:06:02.410> vary<00:06:02.770> the<00:06:02.980> tone<00:06:03.190> that<00:06:03.220> you<00:06:03.460> want

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
more easily vary the tone that you want

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.460 
more easily vary the tone that you want
from<00:06:03.880> thin<00:06:04.120> to<00:06:04.270> thick<00:06:04.300> just<00:06:04.840> by<00:06:05.020> fooling

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.470 
from thin to thick just by fooling

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.950 
from thin to thick just by fooling
around<00:06:05.680> with<00:06:05.860> your<00:06:05.920> mouth<00:06:06.190> I<00:06:06.880> find<00:06:07.570> any<00:06:07.780> way

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 
around with your mouth I find any way

around with your mouth I find any way
for<00:06:08.020> me<00:06:08.320> lit<00:06:08.590> person<00:06:08.950> so<00:06:09.910> anyway<00:06:10.180> I<00:06:10.210> guess<00:06:10.570> I'm

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 
for me lit person so anyway I guess I'm

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.590 
for me lit person so anyway I guess I'm
going<00:06:10.900> off<00:06:11.110> on<00:06:11.140> a<00:06:11.290> rant<00:06:11.530> I<00:06:11.860> don't<00:06:12.430> usually<00:06:12.600> do

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:13.600 
going off on a rant I don't usually do

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.840 
going off on a rant I don't usually do
these<00:06:13.780> sort<00:06:14.050> of<00:06:14.110> talking<00:06:14.350> videos<00:06:14.770> anymore

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:15.850 
these sort of talking videos anymore

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:18.960 
these sort of talking videos anymore
but<00:06:16.570> felt<00:06:17.320> like<00:06:17.440> I<00:06:17.560> should<00:06:17.740> tonight<00:06:17.910> have<00:06:18.910> a
