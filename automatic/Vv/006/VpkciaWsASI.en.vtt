licking<00:00:53.190> their<00:00:53.340> wounds<00:00:53.550> from<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:54.000> so<00:00:54.390> I

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
licking their wounds from that so I

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.939 
licking their wounds from that so I
would<00:00:55.020> hope<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.410> game's<00:00:55.590> going<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.860> be

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
would hope that the game's going to be

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.350 
would hope that the game's going to be
open<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.430> both<00:00:56.610> teams<00:00:56.789> try<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.149> score<00:00:57.300> goals

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
open and both teams try and score goals

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.799 
open and both teams try and score goals
and<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:58.590> predict<00:00:59.280> more<00:00:59.460> painful<00:01:00.090> brazil<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.719> i

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
and I predict more painful brazil and i

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.000 
and I predict more painful brazil and i
think<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.109> netherlands<00:01:01.530> are<00:01:01.649> probably<00:01:01.890> going

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
think the netherlands are probably going

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.850 
think the netherlands are probably going
to<00:01:02.100> win<00:01:02.280> maybe<00:01:02.760> 21<00:01:03.270> or<00:01:03.539> 32<00:01:04.110> okay<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.650> pick

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
to win maybe 21 or 32 okay so you pick

certainly with the bookmakers but i'm
thinking<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.900> game's<00:01:40.079> going<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.290> be<00:01:40.380> very

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
thinking the game's going to be very

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.120 
thinking the game's going to be very
close<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.420> argentina<00:01:42.420> will<00:01:43.350> definitely<00:01:44.009> give

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
close and argentina will definitely give

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.319 
close and argentina will definitely give
germany<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.520> good<00:01:44.700> run<00:01:44.850> for<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.090> money<00:01:45.180> they

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
germany a good run for the money they

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.120 
germany a good run for the money they
certainly<00:01:45.659> won't<00:01:45.810> roll<00:01:46.049> over<00:01:46.350> like<00:01:46.470> resulted

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
certainly won't roll over like resulted

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.230 
certainly won't roll over like resulted
i<00:01:47.310> would<00:01:47.880> say<00:01:48.180> that<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.750> end<00:01:48.899> all<00:01:49.110> day<00:01:49.759> I<00:01:50.759> would

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
i would say that the end all day I would

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.960 
i would say that the end all day I would
say<00:01:51.450> maybe<00:01:51.720> Germany<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:53.159> sneak<00:01:53.460> past<00:01:53.670> and

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
say maybe Germany to to sneak past and

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.600 
say maybe Germany to to sneak past and
claim<00:01:54.240> their<00:01:54.479> first<00:01:54.630> trophy<00:01:54.979> Germany<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.130> NJ

what<00:01:56.790> do<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:56.939> predict<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.360> score<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.689> be<00:01:57.780> I

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
what do you predict the score to be I

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.770 
what do you predict the score to be I
think<00:01:58.170> it's<00:01:58.290> going<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.469> be<00:01:58.530> low<00:01:58.770> scoring<00:01:59.189> 10

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
think it's going to be low scoring 10

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.209 
think it's going to be low scoring 10
probably<00:02:00.780> one<00:02:00.990> goal<00:02:01.200> separate<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.829> two<00:02:01.979> teams

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
probably one goal separate the two teams

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.620 
probably one goal separate the two teams
