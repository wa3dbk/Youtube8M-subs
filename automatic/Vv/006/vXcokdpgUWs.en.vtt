00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
4/10 over in that direction we need my

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.350 
4/10 over in that direction we need my
laser<00:03:39.170> pointer<00:03:39.319> now<00:03:39.650> just<00:03:40.160> up<00:03:40.250> there<00:03:40.430> is<00:03:41.120> the

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
laser pointer now just up there is the

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.490 
search there yeah yeah I'm guessing you
could<00:03:49.970> probably<00:03:50.090> pick<00:03:50.330> out<00:03:50.450> those<00:03:50.600> stars<00:03:50.900> back

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
could probably pick out those stars back

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.070 
could probably pick out those stars back
in<00:03:51.680> London

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
in London

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.930

London you can't see any I've got one oh

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:22.779 
London you can't see any I've got one oh
it<00:04:21.320> might<00:04:21.470> be<00:04:21.590> discrepancy<00:04:22.280> it's<00:04:22.400> on<00:04:22.520> the<00:04:22.640> line

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:22.789 
it might be discrepancy it's on the line

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:29.830 
it might be discrepancy it's on the line
okay<00:04:27.310> so<00:04:28.310> if<00:04:28.400> you<00:04:28.520> can<00:04:28.640> see<00:04:28.820> 12<00:04:29.120> stars<00:04:29.510> within

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
okay so if you can see 12 stars within
