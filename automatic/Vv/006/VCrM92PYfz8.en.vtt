00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.620

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.470
 especially we are in a new news 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.050
 of playstation 4 and is that good as 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.090
 you all know I told the news the 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.790
 another day that they are and would have the same 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.700
 plans that microsoft for the second 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.850
 hand or good would have a kind of 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:23.640
 business in which I would raise the 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.180
 possibility of companies in putting the 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.920
 trm in the famous games and even 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.110
 can you somehow escape the sale 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.189
 second hand you know already 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.780
 explain in the video 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.560
 you have all the information in the video 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.610
 previous in the channel you can find it and 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.200
 complement this information that gives you 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.930
 which is the one I am going to comment on now and 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.900
 is that in the social network twitter 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:50.610
 all the saunier are posting the 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:52.950
 hashtag not ps4 not from rm so they are and 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.800
 Do not fit in the second hand with your new 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.440
 playstation 4 these are the ones like I've 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.360
 said the news related to the 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.229
 second hand they were directly bad 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:07.400
 since yes the good yesterday a few days ago 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:11.000
 which she is echoed and was also 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:14.690
 trying had plans to implement 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.660
 somehow some kind of 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:20.000
 business voucher for the second hand goes very 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.740
 similar to the one you want to take 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.990
 microsoft that has not yet explained 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.870
 your plans neither microsoft nor are and still 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.490
 nothing is clear but rangers have 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.320
 launched a strong campaign on twitter 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.810
 with the hashtag that I told you 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.810
 you are looking at the title to alert 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.550
 to the people of sony that of their march 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.400
 back to that directly that not the 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.970
 pongan is an attempt to put rm in 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.920
 the new console this is something that as 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.660
 you will know ubisoft tried to put the one of rm 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.340
 in some of his games with the loop 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:53.880
 famous play you remember 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.479
 and really, it went badly, it was very 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.090
 wrong and also you have to remember in the case 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.179
 most recently with sheen city having 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.060
 rm I started and really people criticized 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:08.330
 from the first day of departure for I 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.709
 here I think what I think that according to 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.660
 has understood are going to leave the door 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.480
 open for the development of 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.700
 developers are those that implement 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.580
 srm or not or they will be at your disposal 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.650
 if the developer wants to put it 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.650
 will put and sony microsoft will not be able to 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.110
 they are not going to put any hits because it would be 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.450
 lose that game for that console or 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.220
 directly it would not be soleil's fault of 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.620
 microsoft but yes it would be the 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.680
 developer that will implement that of 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.420
 rm so I think this is going to be like this 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.910
 is going to happen is not going to do anything they are going to 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.400
 leave at the hands of the developers and 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.069
 I know and it will be them who we 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.860
 we have to complain so good and 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:52.370
 you can comment tell me what you think 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.870
 especially this one of rb that for me is 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.940
 prison of the games a cancer that has 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.460
 two games 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.530
 although they have tried to implement it for 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:04.650
 fight the piracy that you already know 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.900
 I do not know is a complicated subject to comment 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.880
 what do you think and nothing else as always 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.360
 informing the last one we see ourselves in the 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.360
 following
