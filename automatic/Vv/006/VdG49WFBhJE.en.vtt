00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.890
 this one a number of extinguishing agents 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.990
 In this opportunity we will refer to the three portable painters that are 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.120
 most common use 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.120
 have prevented carbon seo2 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.980
 it is an inert gas 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.160
 odorless and tasteless 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.480
 it is not corrosive and toxic and exp there was coma five times heavier than the air 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.480
 so closes moving occupies its place 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.400
 its greatest effect is obtained from its suffocating power 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.140
 although it also acts a bit by cooling 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.490
 since when it expands violently when applied it reaches a temperature 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.480
 from 43 degrees celsius 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.100
 Being a gas that does not conduct electricity 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.510
 non-corrosive suffocating and refrigerant 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.510
 it is used for extinguishing fires 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.810
 the foam 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.370
 it is an extinguishing agent that acts forming a mantle that covers the game 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.560
 suffocating no and there yes landover 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.560
 must explode quickly over flammable liquids 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.890
 It must be stable 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.580
 will not disappear high temperatures jack must have adhesion properties and 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.070
 cohesion 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.070
 the foam is used with good results 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.400
 after class d 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.790
 although it also applies if those of class a 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.380
 for being constituted in water base 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.120
 should not be used 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.120
 Well, this class s 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.590
 Dry chemical powder pqdc 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.860
 this agent was especially for you my vision 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.999
 interrupting the chain reaction 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:11.390
 Its manufacturing components are sodium bicarbonate 

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:14.379
 by potassium carbonate 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:16.399
 potassium chloride 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:18.989
 diammonium phosphate 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.509
 policies are applied between two classes 

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:23.079
 26 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:29.059
 the pqs to pass of ammonium phosphate are considered multipurpose for games class 

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:03.629
