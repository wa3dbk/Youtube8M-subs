00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.140
 min 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.159
 to play this song to the height that it does indeed deprive them of the 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:40.590
 court roberto carlos 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.219
 we have to put proposals have to do 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:45.420
 if you touch it without cobo fret 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.200
 you can not touch the same 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.280
 it would sing matter nor means below 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.180
 good 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.180
 to begin I want to explain you there are some antics there 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.720
 apart 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.400
 I do not know if you can see the cinema 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.310
 in this part 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.720
 1 - aragon circle and four numbers that follow 4 was locked in a 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.249
 circle and others 

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:13.619
 4 - that this one 

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:16.619
 what is it for, this is all essentially 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:21.489
 per hundred of the beginning of the song the beginning leandro díaz so that you can 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.399
 as care they have nails because the hardest thing is at the beginning to try 

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:26.889
 place the voice well 

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:29.929
 placement at the beginning later it will be easier 

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:31.339
 percent carry 

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:32.399
 the melody 

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:33.769
 in this case 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.609
 is how the song begins with that end 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:38.199
 never min 

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:39.869
 a descent that will be the oiea 

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:42.359
 I love martín 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:46.719
 per hundred then what we do here is tell you that on the fourth string that 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:49.719
 that's good to know in a circle this is the fifth setback 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.029
 after a quarter 

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:55.089
 very different 

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:58.469
 bieber 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:00.919
 if you touch that min 

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:04.379
 neck with the voice knowing how high to start singing 

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:06.649
 min 

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:11.149
 vicky of 200 songs from start to finish 

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:13.239

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.729
 very close efe 

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:21.289
 these indications will sing to you in 100 to place the voice are in each one 

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:24.939
 some songs and you're not going to have problems then 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.549
 to not enter out of tune in that letter 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:32.639
 percent after the rhythm that is used 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:37.289
 he walked number one that has already been extensively explained the songs 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:48.669
 it seems that we hope to have 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:51.669
 a four-stroke count 

00:03:53.029 --> 00:03:56.029
 4 

00:03:58.279 --> 00:03:59.290
 two 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.209
 cristina 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.209
 4 and him 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.669
 there is a part in this song 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:11.669
 we try to cut whoever wants it 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:14.929
 Not every man who knows how to love 

00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:17.929
 the seventies 

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:21.879
 nun 

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:25.659
 we are doing here 

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:30.689
 although there are other positions of solos vinceti major peron his seventh major 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:32.090
 to be chord 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.830
 but let's use this list 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.050
 on this occasion 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.050
 May 12 a 

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:44.999
 F sharp junior seventh inning 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.139
 17 and we're not going to do it here min 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:52.360
 not here as usual but here 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.360
 more than half a second the companies 

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:05.409
 apart from this indication I think that is all that 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:07.400
 we can say 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.900
 in this song 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.900

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.930
