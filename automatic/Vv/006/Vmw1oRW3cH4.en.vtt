hi guys this is an update video about my
planted<00:00:09.030> aquarium<00:00:09.480> here<00:00:09.630> people<00:00:10.019> have<00:00:10.110> been

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
planted aquarium here people have been

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.169 
planted aquarium here people have been
asking<00:00:10.559> about<00:00:10.740> how<00:00:10.920> well<00:00:11.160> it's<00:00:11.309> doing<00:00:11.519> it's

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
asking about how well it's doing it's

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.410 
asking about how well it's doing it's
been<00:00:12.269> established<00:00:13.049> quite<00:00:13.559> a<00:00:13.590> while<00:00:13.799> now<00:00:14.389> so<00:00:15.389> I

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
been established quite a while now so I

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.980 
been established quite a while now so I
thought<00:00:15.599> I'd<00:00:15.719> go<00:00:15.809> ahead<00:00:15.839> and<00:00:16.020> show<00:00:16.410> it<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.650> you

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
thought I'd go ahead and show it to you

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.480 
thought I'd go ahead and show it to you
there's<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.080> series<00:00:19.439> of<00:00:19.560> videos<00:00:19.830> before<00:00:20.250> this

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
there's a series of videos before this

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.670 
there's a series of videos before this
one<00:00:20.760> that<00:00:21.330> go<00:00:21.480> into<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:22.109> know<00:00:22.170> exactly<00:00:22.470> what

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
one that go into you know exactly what

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.320 
one that go into you know exactly what
species<00:00:23.160> of<00:00:23.250> plants<00:00:23.580> are<00:00:23.670> in<00:00:23.699> here<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.150> how<00:00:24.300> I

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
species of plants are in here and how I

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.910 
species of plants are in here and how I
set<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.720> stuff<00:00:24.960> this<00:00:25.199> tank<00:00:25.470> up<00:00:25.619> this<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:25.890> a

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
set the stuff this tank up this is a

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.349 
set the stuff this tank up this is a
wall<00:00:26.189> stand<00:00:26.519> method<00:00:26.880> tank

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
wall stand method tank

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.290 
wall stand method tank
so<00:00:27.869> there's<00:00:28.019> actually<00:00:28.199> potting<00:00:28.710> soil

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
so there's actually potting soil

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.959 
so there's actually potting soil
underneath<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.570> gravel<00:00:30.929> down<00:00:30.960> there<00:00:31.969> and

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
underneath the gravel down there and

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.340 
underneath the gravel down there and
it's<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.180> big<00:00:33.360> reason<00:00:33.480> why<00:00:33.630> this<00:00:33.870> tank<00:00:34.079> has<00:00:34.200> been

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
it's a big reason why this tank has been

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.370 
it's a big reason why this tank has been
so<00:00:34.530> successful<00:00:34.710> for<00:00:35.250> me<00:00:35.870> but<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:36.899> just<00:00:37.110> want<00:00:37.290> to

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.270 
give you an update here to show you what
has<00:00:39.059> changed<00:00:39.450> over<00:00:39.540> time<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.200> how<00:00:40.890> things<00:00:41.160> are

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
has changed over time and how things are

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.430 
has changed over time and how things are
doing<00:00:41.690> if<00:00:42.690> you've<00:00:42.899> watched<00:00:43.079> my<00:00:43.290> previous

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
doing if you've watched my previous

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.290 
doing if you've watched my previous
videos<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.370> first<00:00:44.940> thing<00:00:45.149> you'll<00:00:45.270> probably

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
videos the first thing you'll probably

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.760 
videos the first thing you'll probably
notice<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.200> fact<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:48.350> half<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.530> tank

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
notice is the fact that half the tank

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.139 
notice is the fact that half the tank
doesn't<00:00:50.100> have<00:00:50.190> anything<00:00:50.370> planted<00:00:50.940> in<00:00:51.059> the

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
doesn't have anything planted in the

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.840 
doesn't have anything planted in the
soil<00:00:51.570> anymore<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.590> actually<00:00:53.340> it's<00:00:53.489> over<00:00:53.550> time

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
soil anymore and actually it's over time

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.150 
soil anymore and actually it's over time
things<00:00:54.239> just<00:00:54.420> kind<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.410> drifted<00:00:55.800> out<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:55.920> there

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
things just kind of drifted out of there

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.180 
things just kind of drifted out of there
and<00:00:56.340> they<00:00:57.059> grew<00:00:57.690> just<00:00:57.899> fine<00:00:58.170> not<00:00:58.559> planted<00:00:59.070> in

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
and they grew just fine not planted in

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.130 
and they grew just fine not planted in
the<00:00:59.280> soil<00:00:59.430> at<00:00:59.640> all<00:00:59.730> so<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.539> just<00:01:00.660> kind<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:00.989> left

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
the soil at all so I just kind of left

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.290 
the soil at all so I just kind of left
them<00:01:01.230> floating<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:02.340> see<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.850> think<00:01:02.910> things

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
them floating and see you I think things

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.609 
them floating and see you I think things
are<00:01:03.390> still<00:01:03.600> planted<00:01:03.989> down<00:01:04.080> there<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.500> know

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
are still planted down there you know

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:13.490 
are still planted down there you know
crypts<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.400> stuff<00:01:11.630> but<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.810> majority<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.229> its

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
crypts and stuff but the majority of its

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.320 
crypts and stuff but the majority of its
just<00:01:13.680> free-floating<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.850> fish<00:01:15.060> like

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
just free-floating the fish like

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.730 
just free-floating the fish like
swimming<00:01:15.750> through<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.110> stuff<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.439> I<00:01:16.530> think

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
swimming through and stuff and I think

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.080 
swimming through and stuff and I think
it<00:01:16.830> looks<00:01:17.009> pretty<00:01:17.159> good<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.670> just<00:01:17.700> leave<00:01:17.970> it

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
it looks pretty good so I just leave it

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.440 
it looks pretty good so I just leave it
that<00:01:18.119> way

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
that way

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.260 
that way
as<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.530> can<00:01:19.590> see<00:01:19.740> they've<00:01:19.920> grown<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.520> it's

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
as you can see they've grown that it's

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.300 
as you can see they've grown that it's
pretty<00:01:21.540> significant<00:01:22.229> root<00:01:22.650> structures<00:01:23.130> down

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
pretty significant root structures down

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:33.430 
pretty significant root structures down
there

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.750 

and<00:01:34.440> you<00:01:34.560> will<00:01:34.680> notice<00:01:34.890> quite<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.190> few<00:01:35.430> snails

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:35.760 
and you will notice quite a few snails

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.550 
and you will notice quite a few snails
in<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:36.120> tank<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.510> they<00:01:36.630> don't<00:01:37.170> really<00:01:37.380> hurt

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
in this tank and they don't really hurt

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:48.560 
in this tank and they don't really hurt
anything<00:01:37.800> sighs<00:01:38.100> let<00:01:38.670> him<00:01:38.760> go

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.320 

I<00:01:52.400> think<00:01:53.400> the<00:01:53.490> most<00:01:53.670> interesting<00:01:54.120> part<00:01:54.300> of

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
I think the most interesting part of

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.810 
I think the most interesting part of
this<00:01:54.450> tink<00:01:54.690> is<00:01:54.810> looking<00:01:55.110> at<00:01:55.230> from<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.620> top

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
this tink is looking at from the top

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.860 
this tink is looking at from the top
because<00:01:56.820> all<00:01:56.970> this<00:01:57.150> stuff<00:01:57.390> that's<00:01:57.570> growing

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
because all this stuff that's growing

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.930 
because all this stuff that's growing
out<00:01:58.050> at<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.230> top<00:01:58.410> here<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.860> was<00:01:59.430> going<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.760> put<00:01:59.910> a

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
out at the top here I was going to put a

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.870 
out at the top here I was going to put a
lid<00:02:00.150> on<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.420> aquarium<00:02:00.810> but<00:02:01.800> kind<00:02:02.610> of<00:02:02.670> like<00:02:02.760> the

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
lid on the aquarium but kind of like the

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.270 
lid on the aquarium but kind of like the
way<00:02:02.970> that<00:02:03.210> things<00:02:03.900> were<00:02:04.020> just<00:02:04.190> growing<00:02:05.190> all

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
way that things were just growing all

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.800 
way that things were just growing all
crazy<00:02:05.550> looking<00:02:05.940> out<00:02:06.060> here<00:02:06.240> so<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.420> just<00:02:06.570> left<00:02:06.720> it

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
crazy looking out here so I just left it

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:18.650 
crazy looking out here so I just left it
like<00:02:06.900> this<00:02:16.730> right<00:02:17.730> there<00:02:17.760> they<00:02:18.180> do<00:02:18.240> vary<00:02:18.450> so

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
like this right there they do vary so

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:26.290 
like this right there they do vary so
often

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300

Wallace dad method tank on my youtube

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:49.100 
Wallace dad method tank on my youtube
channel<00:02:39.480> this<00:02:43.459> plant<00:02:44.459> here<00:02:46.340> was<00:02:47.340> uh<00:02:47.370> I<00:02:48.110> had

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
channel this plant here was uh I had

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.170 
channel this plant here was uh I had
like<00:02:49.260> maybe<00:02:49.500> three<00:02:49.860> leaves<00:02:50.160> when<00:02:50.730> I<00:02:50.760> put<00:02:51.000> it<00:02:51.090> in

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
like maybe three leaves when I put it in

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.720 
like maybe three leaves when I put it in
here<00:02:51.360> and<00:02:51.510> it<00:02:51.660> was<00:02:51.800> it<00:02:52.800> was<00:02:52.920> actually<00:02:53.069> dying<00:02:53.520> in

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
here and it was it was actually dying in

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.630 
here and it was it was actually dying in
one<00:02:53.850> of<00:02:53.940> my<00:02:54.030> other<00:02:54.150> aquariums<00:02:55.280> that<00:02:56.280> wasn't

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
one of my other aquariums that wasn't

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.620 
one of my other aquariums that wasn't
really<00:02:57.510> set<00:02:57.810> up<00:02:57.930> for<00:02:58.519> plants<00:02:59.519> so<00:03:00.269> I<00:03:00.300> put<00:03:00.480> it<00:03:00.540> in

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
really set up for plants so I put it in

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.009 
really set up for plants so I put it in
this<00:03:00.720> tank<00:03:01.019> to<00:03:01.110> see<00:03:01.230> how<00:03:01.380> well<00:03:01.560> it<00:03:01.590> would<00:03:01.800> do

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
this tank to see how well it would do

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.910 
this tank to see how well it would do
and<00:03:04.670> you<00:03:05.670> see<00:03:05.850> it's<00:03:05.970> fairly<00:03:06.870> large<00:03:07.110> there<00:03:07.440> but

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
and you see it's fairly large there but

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.710 
and you see it's fairly large there but
then<00:03:08.070> it<00:03:08.220> loops<00:03:08.610> around<00:03:08.910> I'm<00:03:09.360> gonna<00:03:09.450> get<00:03:09.570> that

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
then it loops around I'm gonna get that

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.740 
then it loops around I'm gonna get that
bar<00:03:09.959> and<00:03:10.560> this<00:03:11.310> is<00:03:11.519> the<00:03:11.700> same<00:03:11.880> plant<00:03:12.209> right

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
bar and this is the same plant right

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.400 
bar and this is the same plant right
here<00:03:13.370> you<00:03:14.370> can<00:03:14.519> see<00:03:14.670> it's<00:03:14.819> still<00:03:15.060> growing<00:03:15.410> new

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
here you can see it's still growing new

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:17.530 
here you can see it's still growing new
leaves<00:03:16.440> there

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
leaves there

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.670 
leaves there
and<00:03:18.540> yesterday<00:03:19.019> I<00:03:19.050> cleaned<00:03:19.380> out<00:03:19.530> this

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
and yesterday I cleaned out this

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.309 
and yesterday I cleaned out this
aquarium<00:03:20.360> and<00:03:21.360> I<00:03:21.480> pulled<00:03:21.750> that<00:03:21.989> plant

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
aquarium and I pulled that plant

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:24.259 
aquarium and I pulled that plant
entirely<00:03:22.620> out<00:03:22.890> to<00:03:23.069> see<00:03:23.250> how<00:03:23.400> large<00:03:23.610> it<00:03:23.819> was<00:03:23.910> and

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
entirely out to see how large it was and

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.740 
entirely out to see how large it was and
from<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.860> tip<00:03:26.100> of<00:03:26.130> the<00:03:26.370> leaf<00:03:26.519> to<00:03:27.269> the<00:03:27.450> tip<00:03:27.720> of

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
from the tip of the leaf to the tip of

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.949 
from the tip of the leaf to the tip of
the<00:03:27.930> roots<00:03:28.230> was<00:03:28.980> five<00:03:29.280> feet<00:03:29.579> long<00:03:29.820> so<00:03:30.810> it's

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
the roots was five feet long so it's

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.009 
the roots was five feet long so it's
doing<00:03:31.170> quite<00:03:31.350> well<00:03:32.209> at<00:03:33.209> the<00:03:33.360> same<00:03:33.570> time<00:03:33.780> that<00:03:33.989> I

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
doing quite well at the same time that I

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.690 
doing quite well at the same time that I
put<00:03:34.290> our<00:03:34.560> actually<00:03:34.860> shortly<00:03:35.160> after<00:03:35.459> I<00:03:35.489> put

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
put our actually shortly after I put

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.729 
put our actually shortly after I put
this<00:03:35.880> one<00:03:36.060> and<00:03:36.269> I<00:03:36.329> also<00:03:36.480> put<00:03:36.750> this<00:03:37.200> guy<00:03:37.500> in

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
this one and I also put this guy in

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.170 
this one and I also put this guy in
which<00:03:37.890> is<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.370> same<00:03:38.400> kind<00:03:38.700> of<00:03:38.850> plant<00:03:39.060> is

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
which is the same kind of plant is

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.569 
which is the same kind of plant is
clipping<00:03:39.450> from<00:03:39.630> the<00:03:39.720> same<00:03:39.900> plant<00:03:40.170> and<00:03:40.579> he's

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
clipping from the same plant and he's

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.190 
clipping from the same plant and he's
doing<00:03:41.760> very<00:03:41.880> well<00:03:42.090> -<00:03:42.299> I'll<00:03:42.420> go<00:03:42.510> and<00:03:42.630> take<00:03:42.989> him

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
doing very well - I'll go and take him

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.080 
doing very well - I'll go and take him
out

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
out

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.380 
out
cuz<00:03:45.090> he's<00:03:45.269> much<00:03:45.570> much<00:03:46.230> smaller<00:03:46.590> and<00:03:46.829> easier<00:03:46.890> to

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
cuz he's much much smaller and easier to

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:53.869 
cuz he's much much smaller and easier to
mess<00:03:48.390> with

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:55.970 

that's<00:03:54.689> pretty<00:03:54.930> good<00:03:55.049> growth<00:03:55.319> because<00:03:55.620> he<00:03:55.799> was

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
that's pretty good growth because he was

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.550 
that's pretty good growth because he was
also<00:03:56.819> almost<00:03:57.629> dead<00:03:57.810> when<00:03:57.959> he<00:03:58.019> got<00:03:58.079> put<00:03:58.379> in<00:03:58.469> this

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
also almost dead when he got put in this

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:05.420 
also almost dead when he got put in this
tank<00:04:03.230> see<00:04:04.230> a<00:04:04.260> bunch<00:04:04.499> of<00:04:04.590> little<00:04:04.739> snails<00:04:05.129> in

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
tank see a bunch of little snails in

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:11.490 
tank see a bunch of little snails in
there

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.020 

so<00:04:12.500> I<00:04:12.530> really<00:04:12.800> like<00:04:12.920> how<00:04:12.950> wild<00:04:13.520> this<00:04:13.730> tank

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
so I really like how wild this tank

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.770 
so I really like how wild this tank
looks<00:04:14.300> it<00:04:14.510> it<00:04:15.290> looks<00:04:15.560> very<00:04:16.780> natural

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
looks it it looks very natural

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.479 
looks it it looks very natural
especially<00:04:18.260> if<00:04:18.590> it's<00:04:18.709> seen<00:04:18.830> from<00:04:18.980> the<00:04:19.100> top<00:04:19.250> it

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
especially if it's seen from the top it

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.760 
especially if it's seen from the top it
just<00:04:19.630> looks<00:04:20.630> like<00:04:20.780> a<00:04:20.810> bunch<00:04:20.959> of<00:04:21.050> wild<00:04:21.230> growth<00:04:21.560> I

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:21.770 
just looks like a bunch of wild growth I

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.240 
just looks like a bunch of wild growth I
enjoy<00:04:22.430> that<00:04:22.640> look<00:04:22.820> I<00:04:22.970> know<00:04:23.030> a<00:04:23.150> lot<00:04:23.360> people

enjoy that look I know a lot people

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.320 
enjoy that look I know a lot people
wouldn't<00:04:25.250> like<00:04:25.340> it<00:04:25.520> someone<00:04:25.820> who<00:04:25.970> looks<00:04:26.120> kind

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
wouldn't like it someone who looks kind

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.870 
wouldn't like it someone who looks kind
of<00:04:26.360> cluttered<00:04:26.860> but<00:04:27.860> plants<00:04:28.250> are<00:04:28.400> all<00:04:28.520> healthy
