00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 what's going on people again alex and gt-r 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.049
 there is a new update and that 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.059
 independence day special 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.590
 in my opinion so far one of the 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.309
 coolest updates ever and that 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.230
 I'll ask you a little bit now 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.120
 plan to be prepared in gameplay 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.039
 ours have two new ones 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.199
 Vehicles what many many people 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.720
 wanted a monstertruck and 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.519
 there is now the web collaboration 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.410
 you can then on the raw material side 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.939
 but you can buy the 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.859
 Gentiles and he is only over 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.539
 pegasus available so you can do that 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.489
 do not stand in the garage who have 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.989
 On the other hand, it saves you a lot of cool 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.969
 Also to the place for other vehicles 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.700
 and then there is the western 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.250
 Sovereign or as it is pronounced so 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.290
 a kind harley motorcycle easy in 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.670
 this patriotic color next to then 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.829
 There are 40 new garments 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.860
 of course, everything in this cellar of July 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.660
 style and two new weapons and that 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.539
 once who really party 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.100
 There is a fireworks lounge with it 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.629
 he could then just with the rpg 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.309
 fireworks shooting into the air is 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.170
 is not awesome so I have already 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.760
 Tried and at night and just looks 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.670
 mega funny out or even here how to 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.860
 so easy people with a fireworks 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.520
 picture is so funny I thinks right 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.200
 hot 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.080
 and then there's the muscle or muscle 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.880
 Mask that an old gun should be fine 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.520
 also to remember past times 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.740
 then there are new colors for the 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.650
 Parachute and a 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.770
 automatically have changing smoke trail 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.229
 Of course, these patriotic colors are red 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.640
 white blue and the same with the 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.470
 there are these mature smoke 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.140
 automatic color change combination 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.659
 Now there are twelve new animal masks 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.759
 six different styles with each 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.670
 two different variations in the 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.340
 In addition, four new routes for the 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.039
 customs 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:52.049
 Each of these horns is part of the star 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:55.590
 spangled banner chance ok then there is 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:58.789
 a new hairstyle and 1 stars and 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.810
 stripes face paint for the hairdresser 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.159
 otherwise I had forgotten it 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.289
 also gives normal fireworks 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:08.340
 buy if three four variants 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:10.200
 in the typical white red blue colors 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.340
 is also really funny unfortunately one 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.290
 I have to be honest for a while 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.269
 So although quite short, you can 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.459
 anyway, place over the inventory 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.459
 also and bucket set and so right 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.650
 cool then in the dark as that looks 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:24.390
 Fireworks patters and what I too 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.519
 pretty hard celebration in this update it 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.410
 There are seven new partners and finally 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.110
 not in any of those 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.549
 skyscrapers but individual houses too 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.799
 a bit out of town 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.599
 sometimes even closer to the beach 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:38.640
 however, the environment is of these 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.170
 other houses not necessarily like that 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.599
 It's awesome and the houses are pretty, too 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.220
 there are still small in any case 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.720
 Cooler GT -R where I hope you too 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.400
 still available for purchase 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.480
 become 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.889
 I'm that a really horny 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.060
 Step that it came to that 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:52.350
 Unfortunately, I do not have it from the inside 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.970
 have seen no gameplay 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.560
 because I have no coal all of them 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.600
 I do not have coal anymore 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.209
 to pick one but it does not matter 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.620
 40 he will see himself if you 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.480
 shopping or if your friends 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.769
 which ones are relative anyway 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.480
 small there is not much to look at 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.630
 what many have complained about now 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.790
 these houses is that it is in the garage 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.799
 there is usually room for two cars 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.200
 sometimes it four times for six 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.430
 I could go over six if I did not 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.650
 that would be a bit unrealistic 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.910
 if he has such a tiny garage where 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.150
 You then in the ten cars and parking 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.410
 can 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.609
 but it is not a bad thing in itself 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.099
 problem because it is not so 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:27.510
 that one can own only one partner 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.220
 but you can anyway several 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.139
 have residences and then crashes anyway 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.790
 usually you do not get the car 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:34.680
 anyway about the mechanic and not 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.780
 if you give yourself breaks forth to the garage 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.319
 for a god two places or something 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.810
 So yes, then is a two then 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:44.730
 additional residence i was personally 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.530
 By the way, most of them are just as correct 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.989
 houses like it was at andreas 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.150
 the winner was the first house or in it 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.560
 was something like that when I'm coolest there 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.030
 not so many of me, unfortunately 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.910
 believe that the only thing that is so 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.650
 comes closer 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.970
 However, I like the environment 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.040
 something of not that I think about it 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.510
 I will not pick up but otherwise I am 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.340
 certainly will be in the future too 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.920
 other partners and other houses of 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.630
 future this whole update is by the way 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.740
 limited time available and that 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.450
 until mid-July 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.130
 more exact date wanted rockstar games 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.510
 announce later so if you 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.130
 you should not have that much money 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.350
 hold on a little if you all that 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.540
 still wanted to fetch was supposedly too 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.100
 all that money and glitches and stuff 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.570
 further fixed and also in the crowd 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.800
 other stuff can be the link one the 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.690
 description button is, however, on 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.210
 English is a pretty long list 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.980
 but nothing was great interesting 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.300
 there 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.220
 in that sense, write in the 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.900

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.550

 and what else could you possibly want for that 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.930
 I hope for future updates 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.390
