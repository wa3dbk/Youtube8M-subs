point as we take you into these storms
the<00:00:27.330> big<00:00:27.539> thing<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.320> hail<00:00:28.800> that<00:00:29.279> we're

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
the big thing is the hail that we're

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.420 
the big thing is the hail that we're
going<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.760> continue<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.359> monitor<00:00:30.570> so<00:00:31.230> as<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:31.859> put

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
going to continue to monitor so as I put

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.250 
going to continue to monitor so as I put
this<00:00:32.550> in<00:00:32.790> motion<00:00:32.969> for<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.630> little<00:00:33.989> bit<00:00:34.110> what

this in motion for you a little bit what

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.440 
this in motion for you a little bit what
we're<00:00:34.410> doing<00:00:34.649> now<00:00:34.770> is<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.980> volume<00:00:35.730> scan<00:00:36.149> and

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
we're doing now is a volume scan and

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.119 
we're doing now is a volume scan and
where<00:00:36.600> we<00:00:36.690> have<00:00:36.840> those<00:00:36.960> deep<00:00:37.260> magenta<00:00:37.469> colors

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
where we have those deep magenta colors

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.459 
where we have those deep magenta colors
that's<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.640> Hail<00:00:38.879> scale<00:00:39.629> core<00:00:39.930> within<00:00:40.170> these

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
that's the Hail scale core within these

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.860 
that's the Hail scale core within these
thunderstorms<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.579> tops<00:00:41.850> about<00:00:42.270> twenty

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
thunderstorms and the tops about twenty

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.319 
thunderstorms and the tops about twenty
to<00:00:42.899> forty<00:00:43.290> thousand<00:00:43.710> feet<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.190> some<00:00:44.460> small<00:00:45.120> to

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
to forty thousand feet so some small to

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.810 
to forty thousand feet so some small to
even<00:00:45.480> medium<00:00:46.050> sized<00:00:46.260> hail<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:46.829> possible<00:00:47.489> this

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
even medium sized hail is possible this

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.389 
even medium sized hail is possible this
one<00:00:48.239> storm<00:00:48.600> cell<00:00:48.870> around<00:00:49.200> sandwich<00:00:49.980> right<00:00:50.190> now

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
one storm cell around sandwich right now

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.950 
one storm cell around sandwich right now
which<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:50.820> going<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.180> continue<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.690> push

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
which is going to continue to push

winds and some hail so here's a look at

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.789 
winds and some hail so here's a look at
the<00:01:03.030> big<00:01:03.270> picture<00:01:03.600> we're<00:01:03.899> tracking<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.379> decent

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
the big picture we're tracking a decent

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.100 
the big picture we're tracking a decent
line<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.100> showers<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.640> storms<00:01:06.110> developing

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
push its way to the east you can see the

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.740 
push its way to the east you can see the
nature<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:13.950> this<00:01:14.340> just<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.729> very<00:01:14.970> thin<00:01:15.240> line<00:01:15.479> but

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
nature of this just a very thin line but

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.109 
nature of this just a very thin line but
that<00:01:15.960> one<00:01:16.229> cluster<00:01:16.619> with<00:01:17.250> very<00:01:17.520> heavy<00:01:17.790> rain

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.179 
that one cluster with very heavy rain
frequent<00:01:18.600> lightning<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.080> gusty<00:01:19.110> winds<00:01:19.950> so

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
frequent lightning and gusty winds so

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.039 
frequent lightning and gusty winds so
there's<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.640> slight<00:01:21.030> risk<00:01:21.240> for<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.600> severe

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
there's that slight risk for the severe

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.530 
there's that slight risk for the severe

allows for those showers and storms to

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:10.930 
allows for those showers and storms to
develop<00:03:09.500> so<00:03:10.190> here's<00:03:10.340> a<00:03:10.430> look<00:03:10.550> at<00:03:10.670> satellite

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
develop so here's a look at satellite

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.330 
develop so here's a look at satellite
and<00:03:11.270> radar<00:03:11.510> and<00:03:11.930> what<00:03:12.230> we<00:03:12.380> saw<00:03:12.620> over<00:03:13.010> the<00:03:13.130> past

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
and radar and what we saw over the past

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.740 
and radar and what we saw over the past
couple<00:03:13.520> of<00:03:13.700> hours<00:03:13.820> we<00:03:14.180> had<00:03:14.209> one<00:03:14.480> line<00:03:14.720> of
