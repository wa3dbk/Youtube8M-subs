 I have to work, long working hours and honestly it seems my heart is broken 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:01:03.899
 I am wondering if I will continue doing business as it is. A salesman who enjoys the environment vividly 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.040
 I have some but I do not know how to enjoy it so much

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:18.050
 It is a female salesman who is about to become one in the first year of his own car of a website production company . 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:21.680
 It seems like this kind of trouble if you have to collect the time when it seems that heart breaking is too long 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:25.220
 Increasing the way to what kind of advice do you will do is I first of that advice so can is 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.030
 Before I wondered if I would like to continue sales 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.049
 Please keep on going 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:36.509
 I want you to keep going, because nutrition is an interesting job 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:41.759
 The more you continue, the better it will be, so I think it's hard now, but continue 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:43.159
 I thought that I want to tell the Esseiko enough to become first ahead of I would like you to 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.219
 Well that 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:49.670
 That is why it is a brute force or the quota is intense 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:51.210
 It means that working hours are long, but 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.300
 First of all high 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.260
 Walking for the other party 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.010
 The point is that you are conscious of doing something useful and how motivated you are 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.940
 I think 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.940
 500 Vertical Yes 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:13.069
 If you have suggested it in terms of your company's profit or your own salary, let the other party know 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:18.230
 I see it 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:22.730
 After all you change idea and solve customer's trouble to the last 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:25.620
 It is useful business Sales will be useful for sales 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.650
 So i am 4 a day every day a 4 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:33.660
 Various sales persons through editing 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:40.110
 Then we meet with various managers with sales ability, but 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:41.820
 We are thinking of customers undoubtedly those who are raising yet the results are enjoying the business 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:48.420
 Useful for customers 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:49.710
 Make suggestions in the sense of being helpful, provide various information, and introduce people 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.250
 It is said that 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.240
 What is one common denominator common denominator is it common language 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.910
 Boardwalk 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:05.280
 I see, so the vector you might have turned to yourself in the first place 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:07.040
 The law to be useful and for myself I need change of mind to say to say for the sake of their own 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:13.519
 It seems so 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:15.019
 The person is born and the basic is to want to contribute something or something useful 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:19.310
 You must be thinking like that 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:23.260
 Surely this 23-year-old woman also surely wants to help 1 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:27.129
 That's why I think I 'm going to work 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:33.040
 I think whether there is a policy of the company, but by all means 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:36.010
 Because even the first place people at I become so it is in, rather than sticking to the principle of the other party to Nehodo 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:41.550
 Is a creature that wants to be helpful 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:47.520
 I think that it is best to do it according to its natural mind 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:51.870
 This self-directed tending to tend to buy just for norms or the performance of the company 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.350
 The energy of changing this as if the other party is useful to the vector of 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.090
 of 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.840
 I think there are many things, but are there any things that can be done today for this purpose? 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.540
 please tell me 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:07.469
 It is I hear First of all a good place Saga 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:07.469

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.359
 home page 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:20.150
 Kedomo is that of policy 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:23.350
 What should I do if I create my own website ? 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:27.310
 Well I guess the design is good 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:32.580
 I think there are a lot of good things that you can create a website that can make a great response 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:37.409
 It's like you to full raised me it is as much as possible this three Menoko

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:49.229
 Then I think I want to be will become searchable The nice thing about our customers of our customers 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:52.600

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:57.740

00:04:52.600 --> 00:05:03.020
 Re is it is when you see the place is and your good because I think that it is operating the Rutteyuu 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:03.919
 Without permission to introduce commodity amazing good because use no more Toka ne other person of the individual company to collapse 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.160

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:10.160
 This referral or or myself, as was also ask 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:14.449
 It is such a blog or something like this to introduce 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:20.120
 If there is such a thing naturally yes before that 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:24.919
 After all it's still impossible to work alone with sales 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:31.850
 Help me it or contain tone from There are people who make the products 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:33.330
 There are clerks and juniors, how well do you work in cooperation with these people 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:36.569

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:41.909
 This as of knowing wish Your home is your 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:47.280
 I think it would be possible to get it to work together, then I'm still close at that time 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:50.480
 Yes, take advantage of it looking nice thing about people in-house members 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.480
 Squid nutrition

 Take advantage of the people to make use of is also Te nutrition but it is said to be well better take advantage of Management and face 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:08.080
 The more I I think that's job to make use of the customers to make use of the commodity 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:13.300
 It is cheap enough there I heard going to so good to find Good Points for the 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:14.319
 Oh yes, that means that there are many salespeople who are enjoying themselves lively 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:18.610
 But 

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:19.389
 If you work hard right now, of course if you work now 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.070
 think 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:28.010
 It may be on the way to work 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:32.810
 Deeper and deeper and go to work I'm I come always seem to Tteyuu the fun 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:40.280

 Good for now is to be but I was force to soften discover it is their work joy this 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:46.000
 I'm looking for something 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:51.330
 Even ordinary words of praise casual contact from customers Actually 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:55.979

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:11.320
 Capturing power As you are searching for good places, it will gradually increase 

00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:12.110
 I think the value of work is something you can recognize more 

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:18.380

 Though work is not all that fun 

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:29.020
 It is possible that will change something little by little by also that we have started from looking good Toko 

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:29.020
 I agree 

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:41.129
 I think that when you do not do that 23-year-old woman 

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:45.919
 About the true from the addition and the like continue to the more specific business mentor next time I Officer, President
