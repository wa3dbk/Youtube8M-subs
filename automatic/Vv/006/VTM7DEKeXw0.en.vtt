00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
where im using a really interesting team

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.540 
where im using a really interesting team
because<00:00:25.230> it<00:00:25.320> has<00:00:25.439> no<00:00:25.470> structure<00:00:25.980> but<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:26.400> has<00:00:26.519> a

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
because it has no structure but it has a

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.570 
because it has no structure but it has a
furfrou<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:27.990> want<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.980> do<00:00:29.099> something<00:00:29.490> so

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
hopefully it will anyway lead off with

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.049 
hopefully it will anyway lead off with
Marvin<00:00:31.650> swine<00:00:31.800> against<00:00:32.040> annoy<00:00:32.340> Vern<00:00:32.610> my<00:00:32.790> first

Marvin swine against annoy Vern my first

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.670 
Marvin swine against annoy Vern my first
instinct<00:00:33.570> is<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.750> get<00:00:33.899> up<00:00:33.989> stealth<00:00:34.260> rocks<00:00:34.530> i'm

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
instinct is to get up stealth rocks i'm

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.500 
instinct is to get up stealth rocks i'm
thinking<00:00:34.980> perhaps<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.670> switch<00:00:35.940> is<00:00:36.120> imminent

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
thinking perhaps the switch is imminent

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.790 
thinking perhaps the switch is imminent
because<00:00:36.989> doesn't<00:00:37.230> want<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.410> be<00:00:37.469> hit<00:00:37.620> with<00:00:37.649> an

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
because doesn't want to be hit with an

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.549 
because doesn't want to be hit with an
ice<00:00:37.980> shard<00:00:38.309> or<00:00:38.460> icicle<00:00:38.879> crash<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.300> die<00:00:39.559> but

ice shard or icicle crash and die but

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:41.869 
ice shard or icicle crash and die but
ends<00:00:40.800> up<00:00:40.829> just<00:00:40.980> dragon<00:00:41.309> parts<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.610> me<00:00:41.700> which<00:00:41.850> is

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
ends up just dragon parts of me which is

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.420 
ends up just dragon parts of me which is
curious<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.629> allows<00:00:42.930> me<00:00:43.230> on<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.010> second<00:00:44.309> turn

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
curious it allows me on the second turn

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.369 
curious it allows me on the second turn
to<00:00:44.550> go<00:00:44.670> for<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.850> nice<00:00:45.000> shot<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.450> still<00:00:46.170> the

to go for a nice shot and still the
Noven<00:00:46.680> stays<00:00:46.950> in<00:00:47.190> which<00:00:47.399> i<00:00:47.670> wonder<00:00:48.390> what<00:00:49.050> the

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
Noven stays in which i wonder what the

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.290 
Noven stays in which i wonder what the
logic<00:00:49.559> behind<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.920> was<00:00:50.190> but<00:00:50.489> regardless

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
logic behind that was but regardless

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.939 
logic behind that was but regardless
it's<00:00:51.660> gone<00:00:52.020> it's<00:00:52.260> out<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.500> way<00:00:52.590> so<00:00:52.620> don't<00:00:52.800> need

it's gone it's out the way so don't need

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
to worry about it anymore but incomes

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.270 
to worry about it anymore but incomes
eager<00:00:54.570> /<00:00:54.870> which<00:00:55.079> can<00:00:55.350> be<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.590> problem<00:00:55.649> for<00:00:56.070> me

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
eager / which can be a problem for me

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.160 
eager / which can be a problem for me
especially<00:00:56.579> when<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.270> has<00:00:57.329> shadow<00:00:57.690> sneak<00:00:57.960> and

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
it can brutally murder me with it so I'm

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.150 
it can brutally murder me with it so I'm

off the intimidate means I'm able to

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.450 
off the intimidate means I'm able to
take<00:01:03.930> any<00:01:04.170> physical<00:01:04.650> hit<00:01:04.830> from<00:01:04.979> this<00:01:05.189> thing

and I of course resist both the sacred
jewel<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.040> iron<00:01:08.220> head<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:08.580> if<00:01:08.670> he<00:01:08.729> wants

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
jewel and the iron head so if he wants

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.429 
jewel and the iron head so if he wants
to<00:01:08.970> go<00:01:09.150> for<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.360> predicting<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.020> switch<00:01:10.229> I

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
to go for the predicting the switch I

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.230 
to go for the predicting the switch I
can<00:01:10.860> take<00:01:11.010> those<00:01:11.159> as<00:01:11.340> well<00:01:11.460> iron<00:01:11.790> head<00:01:11.970> turns

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
can take those as well iron head turns

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.670 
can take those as well iron head turns
out<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.450> be<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.600> case<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.320> reason<00:01:13.500> I

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
out to be the case and the reason I

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.590 
out to be the case and the reason I
don't<00:01:13.890> go<00:01:14.189> for<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.460> mega<00:01:14.700> evolution<00:01:15.270> here<00:01:15.450> is

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
don't go for the mega evolution here is

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.120 
don't go for the mega evolution here is
I<00:01:15.630> predicted<00:01:16.170> him<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.500> go<00:01:16.650> for<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.860> sacred

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
I predicted him to go for the sacred

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.710 
I predicted him to go for the sacred
sword<00:01:17.520> because<00:01:17.759> if<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:17.970> transformed<00:01:18.509> into<00:01:18.630> a

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
sword because if I transformed into a

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.270 
sword because if I transformed into a
dark-type<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.500> would<00:01:19.619> be<00:01:19.710> super<00:01:19.890> effective

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
dark-type it would be super effective

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.820 
dark-type it would be super effective
and<00:01:20.640> spell<00:01:21.119> my<00:01:21.270> demise<00:01:21.600> instead<00:01:22.229> he<00:01:22.619> actually

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
and spell my demise instead he actually

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.410 
and spell my demise instead he actually
asked<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.250> go<00:01:23.340> for<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.490> Shadow<00:01:23.729> Ball<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:24.150> mega

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
asked to go for the Shadow Ball so mega

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.820 
asked to go for the Shadow Ball so mega
evolving<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:25.020> probably<00:01:25.439> would<00:01:25.619> have<00:01:25.680> been<00:01:25.799> a

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
evolving that probably would have been a

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.310 
evolving that probably would have been a
better<00:01:25.979> idea<00:01:26.220> but<00:01:26.880> instead<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.479> decide<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.080> do

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
better idea but instead I decide to do

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.080 
better idea but instead I decide to do
it<00:01:28.439> now<00:01:28.470> predicting<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.340> shadow<00:01:29.610> sneak<00:01:29.880> to

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
it now predicting the shadow sneak to
