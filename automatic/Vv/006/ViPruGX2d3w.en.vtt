00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:23.659
 it costs alone I think we have cottonou a bit like a diesel car 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.159
 tonight we started 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:28.929
 slowly and then we ended up strong I think before 

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:31.929
 the few weeks this match before internet the coach said 

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:37.929
 made the difference in the last third-time and then win a match 

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:38.799
 it's still 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:40.799
 these promo forecasts 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.369
 funny we played against the team acquired record 

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:46.499
 what end of the season they have problems in terms of the coach 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:50.579
 it's always hard gold 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.039
 they played better than us and more active 

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:56.349
 motivated to make a good match they find themselves there 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.690
 because of its format and are marked on a portrait is to that 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:00.489
 platinum 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.930
 for that reason it must be more than we trainers want 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.279
 really 

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:08.559
 a tier 1 phone call stays at the level and then play as well 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:12.399
 in addition we can cite choice whatever it is important for the team 

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:14.069
 with appropriateness 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.219
 it's the whole team that was doing the work that gave it 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:19.809
 the impulse to yalda's 

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:21.599
 at the end of the evening 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:24.989
 incredible love and then to show everyone that he is still 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.809
 able to do things like that happen 

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:27.949
 we need him in 

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:29.289
 in this state of mind 

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:31.049
 as the saying goes 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.049
 to score in lego 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:34.059
 and then every year 

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.870
 andy murray 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.610
 the team but I think it's a great performance from the whole team 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.039
 evening in the championship well we worked well 

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:43.039
 the luxury saddler place we took three points 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:47.259
 Dairy farmers points 

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:49.749
 today the villa 

00:03:49.749 --> 00:03:52.749
 the few times in the ramparts were not to show character 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:55.049
 for the best 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.589
 in the game and then we did not let go in France 

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:59.799
 prosor also needs and it's part 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.799
 bulkypix will begin to show its character 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.239
 mehmet okur after opening the scoring 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.239
 we did not hurt by the fall in wages 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:12.369
 he had that habitat 

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:13.669
 from this week 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:14.679
 outdated 

00:04:14.679 --> 00:04:15.699
 I think it is 

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:18.419
 sabourin has also worked to the positive since it took 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.769
 you have to put in your pocket 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.220
 more still body 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.599
 m a pretty serene meeting 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:27.629
 but we can not do anything on the right path 

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:29.330
 there we still have a match 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.840
 another tough match this week 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.840
 I will have to work anyway everyone is waiting for us 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.310
 the meeting continues on this path
