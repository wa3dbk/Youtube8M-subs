00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:03.799
 it lacked three 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.660
 jumped from three to a first person shooter which makes the players 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.949
 of the team the team of the second world war 

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:13.639
 only not as a spectator 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:16.639
 and yes active participant 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:25.860
 the script narrates the 88 days of the Allied campaign 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.779
 and started with the collaborative operation started almost two months after the d 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.320
 and culminated in the liberation of paris from the domains of the Nazi army 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.790
 everything is told from the perspective of several armies aligned the style of 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.020
 game is basically the same in all consortiums with the exception of iptu that 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.360
 use wilmots to aim the target and control vision while directional 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.149
 from the high hill 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:50.850
 shift command 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.260
 for operation 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.840
 with precision and speed but at the time of turning the camera gets complicated 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.020
 because it is necessary to take the aim to the limits of the screen 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.920
 soon after a brief history it is time to act on the front line from there 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.540
 you get out of a truck and as always dramatically begins the fight 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.340
 after the vehicle is attacked 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.440
 so why know it's a bloody battle 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.920
 in that atmosphere of chaos that is lived in the club 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.920
 reproduces with mastery 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.880
 mr 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.710
 The objectives are usually civilian, summing up their mandate to 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.020
 vehicle 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.840
 the problem is that among them there are a lot of Nazis wanting to start 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.880
 your 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.310
 sometimes you get other men how to defend a position over time 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.659
 the dam day acts as predecessor ie take marty sequence 

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:14.029
 but passes by asks for a while this eliminates position like magic 

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:15.939
 the food campaign 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:18.449
 and the pre-programmed events take 

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:22.079
 the focus of freedom the player who is compensated by stocks and commodities 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.569
 one asks for spontaneity but there are several scenes with much adrenaline 

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:28.599
 Sometimes 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:33.459
 some event was programmed does not trigger purity preventing the player from advancing 

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:35.540
 but it's rare to happen 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.340
 except on playstation 3 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.529
 and received the most unstable version 

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:42.829
 and besides the siblings, it tends to be slow in some games 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.609
 which is admirable around q3 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:48.219
 is their ability to provide 

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:50.449
 the environments almost never repeat themselves 

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:54.159
 in each new area you will have to discover the best as elitist if 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:56.649
 protect from the shooting hail 

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:59.659
 in closed places the request and the lack of visibility 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:04.549
 when some opponents appear from where they least expected 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:07.539
 they can take out their gun and start fighting 

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:09.519
 because it works like a mini games 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.269
 in which you should get a sequence of buttons I will use the services of 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:14.160
 hospitalization 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.699
 in the case of the playstation 3 thousand items 

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:17.570
 in the end 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.570
 a butt ends with the fall of the arm 

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:37.759
 the climate and chaos a war were also 

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:42.499
 in return he created with explosions tinos of destruction everywhere 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.669
 the environments are complex and son 

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:48.530
 thanks to the large number of soldiers and tanks 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.299
 and smoke that appear 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.199
 and also of airplanes crossing the sky 

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:57.019
 which also features a multi-player mode 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.159
 miami or not 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:02.670
 in this issue the version for the wii would stand out more negatively 

00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:07.399
 because it does not bring any mode to more than one player or split screen 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:12.149
 the best bid up close and export 360 

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:15.829
 thanks to its robust network structure integrated into the 

00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:19.859
 the version for playstation 3 come close 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:20.959
 with a good performance 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.390
 but does not have scoring system nor does it compensate by st 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.550
 in the new generation the limit is 24 participants 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.910
 already in the sport the two of them are two 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.110
 there are 16 players 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.689
 the pm counts on multiple modalities multiply simple text kills 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.729
 the two groups should protect 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:43.449
 strategic points 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:45.529
 the seven classes of soldiers 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:48.139
 each with different characteristics 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:53.990
 in visual terms the best edition edwards sport360 and brings details 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.990
 and textures and surfaces 

00:04:57.749 --> 00:05:00.170
 light and shadow work impresses 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.870
 as well as the dissuasive effects of smoke 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.870
 evidently present by 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.550
 the current functions mainly netbooks 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:11.449
 the sporting 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:14.180
 with good amount of waste and effect 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.479
 the smoke may not be so real 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:19.479
 as in the new generation but is deceived 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:25.109
 the visual of the go is similar to the one of fc porto only that counts on a modeling 

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:27.539
 with more speed 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:29.810
 already the version for playstation 3 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.889
 it seems to be 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:36.219
 support for high-resolution effects and amount of objects are 

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:39.550
 comparable to other 360 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.029
 but the textures do not arrive meir 

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:44.790
 sound quality 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.790
 already a tradition in the series does not disappoint 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.669
 the incessant sound of the sons explosions the screaming soldiers and the tanks 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:55.979
 complete with immersion experience 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:59.590
 the soundtrack is a typical war movie orchestra 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.340
 and the dubbing should only normalize typical of soldiers 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:05.430
 the pcdob 3 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.430
 It's more of a party quality game that is the most cinematic 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:11.669
 the first person 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:17.159
 the record brings nothing innovative but the dramatic campaigns always satisfy 

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:21.580
 the player without speaking on the foot quite sturdy foot 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:26.129
 it is guaranteed fun for those who like a strong and fast even the 

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:29.119
 first-time recruits can have fun 

00:06:29.119 --> 00:06:31.279
 because pm we did not complete more than necessary
