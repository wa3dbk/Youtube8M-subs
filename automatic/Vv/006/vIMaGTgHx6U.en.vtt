that it was the latter and I don't think

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.050 
that it was the latter and I don't think
you<00:01:31.290> can<00:01:31.470> blame<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.740> government<00:01:32.250> for<00:01:32.549> acting

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
you can blame a government for acting

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.880 
you can blame a government for acting
against<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.540> known<00:01:33.750> tyrant<00:01:34.259> as<00:01:34.380> Andrew<00:01:34.680> says

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
against a known tyrant as Andrew says

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.100 
against a known tyrant as Andrew says
would<00:01:35.159> form<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.729> man<00:01:36.299> had<00:01:36.509> already<00:01:36.659> invaded

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
would form a man had already invaded

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.230 
would form a man had already invaded
Kuwait<00:01:37.710> years<00:01:38.220> before<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.820> had<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:38.970> be<00:01:39.030> kicked

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
Kuwait years before and had to be kicked

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.480 
Kuwait years before and had to be kicked
out<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.479> there<00:01:39.780> for<00:01:40.740> acting<00:01:41.040> on<00:01:41.159> what<00:01:41.189> turned

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
out of there for acting on what turned

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.280 
out of there for acting on what turned
out<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.670> be<00:01:41.880> faulty<00:01:42.090> intelligence<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.780> every

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
out to be faulty intelligence that every

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.050 
out to be faulty intelligence that every
country<00:01:43.680> in<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.860> world<00:01:43.950> believed<00:01:44.610> was<00:01:44.790> true

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
country in the world believed was true

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.999 
country in the world believed was true
so<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:46.020> think<00:01:46.140> when<00:01:46.439> Blair<00:01:46.649> comes<00:01:46.860> with

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
so I think when Blair comes with

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.190 
so I think when Blair comes with
inquirer<00:01:47.310> next<00:01:47.610> week<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:48.060> think<00:01:48.840> we'll<00:01:48.990> see

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
inquirer next week I think we'll see

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.440 
inquirer next week I think we'll see
that<00:01:49.439> he's<00:01:50.009> not<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.220> liar<00:01:50.460> at<00:01:50.670> all<00:01:50.850> but<00:01:51.210> he<00:01:51.299> was

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
that he's not a liar at all but he was

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.380 
that he's not a liar at all but he was
operating<00:01:51.780> on<00:01:52.170> faulty<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.790> Carmen

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
operating on faulty and Carmen

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.480 
operating on faulty and Carmen
that's<00:01:54.750> Kenny<00:01:54.990> should<00:01:55.110> are<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:56.159> we're<00:01:56.310> going

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
that's Kenny should are and we're going

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.340 
that's Kenny should are and we're going
to<00:01:56.550> go<00:01:56.670> past<00:01:56.940> Richards<00:01:57.420> Denise<00:01:57.600> Richards<00:01:57.870> to

telling the truth he believes early

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.140 
telling the truth he believes early
right<00:02:55.230> fastest<00:02:55.800> race<00:02:56.040> he<00:02:56.730> personally

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
right fastest race he personally

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.789 
right fastest race he personally
believes<00:02:57.420> he's<00:02:57.600> doing<00:02:57.630> God's<00:02:58.050> work<00:02:58.260> but<00:02:58.560> has

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
believes he's doing God's work but has

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.160 
believes he's doing God's work but has
not<00:02:59.070> asked<00:02:59.610> God<00:02:59.820> what<00:03:00.000> needs<00:03:00.299> doing<00:03:00.720> no<00:03:00.900> I

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
not asked God what needs doing no I

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.900 
not asked God what needs doing no I
think<00:03:01.680> God<00:03:01.890> probably<00:03:02.340> would<00:03:02.459> get<00:03:02.579> him<00:03:02.730> some

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
think God probably would get him some

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.479 
think God probably would get him some
light<00:03:03.120> dusting<00:03:03.360> to<00:03:03.720> do<00:03:03.870> or<00:03:04.650> get<00:03:04.829> some<00:03:05.010> card<00:03:05.280> and

light dusting to do or get some card and

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.729 
light dusting to do or get some card and
crayons<00:03:05.880> on<00:03:06.120> so<00:03:06.420> you<00:03:06.570> just<00:03:06.750> do<00:03:07.350> you<00:03:07.440> do<00:03:07.590> the
