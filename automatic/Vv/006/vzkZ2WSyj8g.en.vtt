how<00:00:04.859> to<00:00:05.130> access<00:00:05.640> websites<00:00:06.299> that<00:00:06.480> are<00:00:06.540> blocked

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
how to access websites that are blocked

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.410 
how to access websites that are blocked
by<00:00:07.170> your<00:00:07.200> ISP<00:00:07.890> so<00:00:08.550> if<00:00:08.849> you<00:00:09.030> get<00:00:09.179> a<00:00:09.210> message

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
by your ISP so if you get a message

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.980 
by your ISP so if you get a message
saying<00:00:09.750> error<00:00:10.139> met<00:00:10.650> error<00:00:10.980> website<00:00:11.550> blocked

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:11.990 
saying error met error website blocked

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.959 
saying error met error website blocked
then<00:00:12.990> that<00:00:13.230> basically<00:00:13.830> means<00:00:14.099> that<00:00:14.250> your<00:00:14.519> ISP

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
then that basically means that your ISP

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.160 
then that basically means that your ISP
doesn't<00:00:15.269> want<00:00:15.389> you<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.599> access<00:00:15.929> our<00:00:16.020> website

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
doesn't want you to access our website

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.740 
doesn't want you to access our website
probably<00:00:16.890> due<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.220> copyright<00:00:17.520> issues<00:00:17.850> so

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
probably due to copyright issues so
