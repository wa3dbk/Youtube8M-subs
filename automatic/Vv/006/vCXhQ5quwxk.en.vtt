45<00:02:12.410> degree<00:02:12.830> angle<00:02:15.970> accomplished<00:02:16.970> nice<00:02:19.630> now<00:02:20.630> we

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
45 degree angle accomplished nice now we

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.020 
45 degree angle accomplished nice now we
get<00:02:21.170> down<00:02:21.380> beyond<00:02:21.860> this<00:02:22.069> part<00:02:22.459> towards<00:02:22.940> the
