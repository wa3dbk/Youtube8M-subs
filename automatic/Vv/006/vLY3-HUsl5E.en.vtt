00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.570
 hello friends now we'll take a look 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.480
 in the womb of one of the first mobile 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.099
 phone daesy 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:17.490
 remove the battery to get to 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.580
 sim card rechargeable battery 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.160
 consists of five nickel metal hydride 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:27.539
 items the size of the SIM card is the same as 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.640
 the size of a regular phone card on 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.920
 days samsung company reported that 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.610
 launches mobile phone in 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.829
 watch case and me around 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.500
 the same time in the flea market got caught 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.239
 one of the first mobile eyes 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.129
 phones 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:47.160
 once such a mobile phone cost 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.500
 more expensive than a used car I could 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.469
 only see similar luxuries 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.739
 on TV in general I could not get through 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.890
 by because I really wanted to look 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.199
 inside this device especially as one 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.439
 from modern cell phones 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.320
 I have recently made out so all who 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.880
 interested in the contents of this museum 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:15.360
 exhibit can join me 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.490
 Now I removed the front panel and 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.390
 bared 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:26.210
 PCB with phone interface 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:31.500
 which is located the speaker on the display 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:34.020
 microphone keyboard itself this printed 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.100
 the board is connected to the main with the help of 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.100
 this connector 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:45.750
 everything is quite technological and 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.750
 maintainable 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.039
 Sorry for any technical 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.179
 information about this phone model on 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:55.090
 company website 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:57.819
 failed to find all the same were found 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:01.000
 only episodic mention all 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:03.459
 here is the sale of this rarity in German 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.030
 branch and would and on some others and 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:09.789
 auctions so i can only report 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:15.970
 about the weight of the device that is equipped 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:20.700
 condition is about 400 grams here 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:23.760
 now I unscrew some screws 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:27.250
 hexagon mom slot 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:34.950
 to get the main 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:38.700
 circuit board phone analog part 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:43.709
 phone reception transfer 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.709
 is on the screen 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.819
 so you have to remove the screen caps 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:58.810
 on the way here is a sim card socket which 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.850
 also attached to the PCB 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.850
 contacts 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.850
 spring-loaded 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.430
 remove small screen 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.040
 here it is the main board 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.590
 someone already and and tried to repair a 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.970
 like tasting one of the window mounting screws 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:03.360
 was broken well and besides 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:10.870
 soldered memory chip apparently for the purpose 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:15.459
 reflash the phone and now let's take a look 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:18.310
 inside the power supply more precisely charger 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:21.700
 devices like this battery is attached 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.750
 the charger uses the same 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.990
 later yours 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:33.630
 for attachment to the mobile casing 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:41.470
 phone by the way this is my first attempt 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:44.310
 shooting using two cameras do not know 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.310
 how awful it is 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:08.720
 Now the most interesting look is that 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:11.240
 as you can see inside 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.990
 charger assembled without help 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:18.400
 ration individual nodes are connected to 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.400
 using spring contacts 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:26.540
 Apparently German labor montage prostrated and cost 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:29.830
 Much more expensive than Chinese modern 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:34.030
 mobile phone charger 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:37.340
 going to rations 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:45.010
 here everything is on such spring 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:45.010
 Contact thanks for your attention
