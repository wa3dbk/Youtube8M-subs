00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.330
 went to the heart of not buying the 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.330
 entraÃ±a of this house and outside 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:19.490
 if it were a little easier then 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.490
 now 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.210
 the little bit more or less than five 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.009
 centimeters put there 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:31.269
 with these millions I have more cut 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:35.489
 and now instead of cutting doctors 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:35.489
 Taras and will cost a lot 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.890
 sorry we could them 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:50.660
 the metal is a cookbook 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.000
 listening to music dancing taking you 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.520
 good in family 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.410
 in that one next door and so because you are born 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.250
 because it comes out because the senses 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.250
 give a hug 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.150
 Now that he likes love 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.470
 it was the moment that sherman would have to 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.710
 have taken advantage of 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:24.580
 the hug fell asleep 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:28.890
 my god stayed there late 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.890
 Well then cuts here 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:40.510
 now he cut it so he does not eat that then 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.510
 turn 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.310
 they are breaking the pounds that later 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.520
 they separate much more easily with your 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.520
 teeth 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:04.539
 this is the first thing that meat then 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:06.430
 takes it out first and then cut in 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:11.280
 segments and then through fiber 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.280
 blood with my yellow skirt 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.570
 clear as I love you 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.430
 we invite you to talk 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
 p 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.980
 it looks like a sack and the 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.230
 manga and pretty serious really is 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.530
 here it is clear 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:45.840
 if there is something that he also causes already 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.760
 that afterwards he left in the future 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.230
 you're going to put them more or less prepared the 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.160
 meat that I put a little oil 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:59.190
 but I did not put 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:03:01.050
 now a little mushroom and it's 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.490
 relatively new you know that no 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.920
 nothing happens if I work it 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.290
 and many times we did it surely the 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:12.300
 file to send to the front was once 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:15.090
 to listen to record it properly 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.280
 everything is everything that comes to your home I 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.380
 I have to apply them in rowing also the 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.630
 point is to leave them beautiful in soaking 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:25.100
 because look at the structure that the 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.100
 inner side of the hat 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:33.180
 like lettuce a lot of time and it's going to 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.180
 absorb something always
