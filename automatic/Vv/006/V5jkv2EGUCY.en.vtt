 I keep flint with it networks 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:08.520
 Incidentally, the manufacturer is this 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.600
 punishment time I say it now 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:17.549
 but so far so good 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:22.869
 the knife is now before us now 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:26.189
 back the offspring buck to the data it 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:31.569
 has a total length of 21 centimeters 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:39.249
 The blade length is 96 centimeters 

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:42.429
 to the size of the strongest yes if the 

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:46.799
 strongest side of the knife is with it 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:48.789
 four millimeters against strength indicated 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:53.770
 was sanded 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:59.369
 cpm 3v steel the loud manufacturer with 58 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:04.029
 until 59 had 58 to 60 rockwell 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:11.290
 early cut to this handle 

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:15.069
 Material is called to say that it only 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:18.129
 a total of eight times here at bonn 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:22.260
 at barack obama to the springboks 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:25.120
 series was launched 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:30.219
 for the production is according to my knowledge 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:34.269
 so aluminum is the gate or gate fabric 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:37.150
 music image uses it with me 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.560
 I have filled resin with synthetic resin 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.150
 becomes 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:45.639
 You seem to be careful that I'm there 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:49.560
 No bubbles form because it's difficult 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:54.849
 it will not be a blessing too 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:57.579
 handle show used in the material like 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:03.219
 I always have to say the bar over knife 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:07.419
 again very fine and clapped 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:11.519
 Once again, you have barely got one 

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:16.620
 transition between screws and handle 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:20.699
 material all knew beautifully sanded 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:24.370
 again a very nice knife 

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:25.829
 This springbok is given as a 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.720
 universal knife 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:31.299
 although I do not know if this blood 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.209
 drinne americans say there also 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:39.659
 follow is actually inserted 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:42.790
 was as was milled out as 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:45.609
 weight savings or when 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:50.009
 universal and universally applicable 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:50.009
 Knife is also for hunting purposes 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:04:00.189
 wrong cutting edge with ground 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.229
 and I take the knife in now 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:06.930
 the hand 

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:09.099
 for me again in four finger fair 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.709
 is very good in the hand 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:15.549
 At the beginning, I thought this was going on 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:18.370
 material actually only on the 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:23.199
 slide in the side is but 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:27.360
 as you can hear it is still the finger 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:31.060
 Resistance and it is actually full 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:34.270
 and well bad in so hand 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.280
 I did not rubber it it is it has to 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:41.020
 compare with a bit of acrylic glass 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:43.630
 similar to the camera that captures everything 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:47.610
 so beautiful a speechless to the 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:54.070
 dusk I'm here under the roof 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:55.979
 something as simple as a window 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.389
 kitchen work done 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:00.160
 Jacob then recorded with 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:03.539
 kitchen crepe again this tailor 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:08.830
 made everything with excellence and passed 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:12.520
 the steffi has and the data with it 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:15.400
 Meal preparation made with the knife 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:20.440
 I did not cut that soon so far 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:26.250
 inserted but a bit high 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:30.599
 pulled so technically quite form so 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.599
 say it 's wood like butter 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:39.219
 under daily 3 so stole 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.679
 reground I have not but keeps 

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:45.639
 his sheep pretty much one 

00:05:40.679 --> 00:05:49.839
 size comparison of the 21 jessica is 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:51.659
 springboks has jumped 96 centimeters 

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:56.489
 Sound length it takes 110 

00:05:51.659 --> 00:06:01.209
