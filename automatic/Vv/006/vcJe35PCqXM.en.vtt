00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
so this gets sorted into each chest now

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.410 
so this gets sorted into each chest now
there's<00:01:18.600> some<00:01:19.220> there<00:01:20.220> there<00:01:21.090> will<00:01:21.180> be<00:01:21.240> some

so um let's go on and build it what you
will<00:01:59.579> need<00:01:59.790> is<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:01.610> regular<00:02:02.610> chest<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:03.320> fab<00:02:04.320> chest

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
will need is a regular chest a fab chest

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.160 
will need is a regular chest a fab chest
Hoppa<00:02:06.540> comparator<00:02:07.830> repeater<00:02:08.830> a<00:02:09.190> torch<00:02:10.170> some

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
Hoppa comparator repeater a torch some

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.080 
Hoppa comparator repeater a torch some
dust<00:02:11.820> my<00:02:12.820> block<00:02:13.390> of<00:02:13.740> choice<00:02:14.740> now<00:02:15.640> a<00:02:15.670> block<00:02:15.970> to

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
dust my block of choice now a block to

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.310 
dust my block of choice now a block to
put<00:02:16.180> your<00:02:16.300> vest<00:02:16.390> on<00:02:16.510> on<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:16.870> I<00:02:16.959> blocked<00:02:17.200> you

put your vest on on and I blocked you

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.130 
put your vest on on and I blocked you
build<00:02:17.500> with<00:02:18.450> so<00:02:19.450> let's<00:02:19.600> just<00:02:19.780> start<00:02:19.930> it<00:02:20.050> off

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
build with so let's just start it off

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.470 
build with so let's just start it off
site<00:02:20.380> next<00:02:20.530> here<00:02:20.830> you<00:02:21.070> want<00:02:22.060> to<00:02:22.120> start<00:02:22.330> off<00:02:22.450> by

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
site next here you want to start off by

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.670 
site next here you want to start off by
making<00:02:22.780> a<00:02:23.020> low<00:02:23.140> plus<00:02:23.410> sign<00:02:24.959> so<00:02:25.959> you<00:02:26.530> make<00:02:26.650> a

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
making a low plus sign so you make a

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.360 
making a low plus sign so you make a
plus<00:02:26.920> sign<00:02:27.130> and<00:02:27.900> you<00:02:28.900> add<00:02:29.170> a<00:02:29.650> block<00:02:30.220> right

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
plus sign and you add a block right

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.040 
plus sign and you add a block right
there<00:02:30.480> so<00:02:31.480> this<00:02:31.570> is<00:02:31.690> what<00:02:31.810> it<00:02:31.900> should<00:02:31.930> look

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
there so this is what it should look

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.270 
there so this is what it should look
like<00:02:32.970> you<00:02:33.970> want<00:02:34.120> to<00:02:34.180> take<00:02:34.300> your<00:02:34.420> repeater<00:02:34.810> and

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
like you want to take your repeater and

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.280 
like you want to take your repeater and
put<00:02:36.280> it<00:02:36.400> in<00:02:36.520> that<00:02:36.700> empty<00:02:36.880> spot<00:02:37.180> with<00:02:37.959> a<00:02:37.989> torch

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
put it in that empty spot with a torch

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.770 
put it in that empty spot with a torch
on<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.440> back<00:02:38.650> of<00:02:38.830> it<00:02:39.239> then<00:02:40.239> on<00:02:40.390> these<00:02:40.540> two

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
on the back of it then on these two

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.500 
on the back of it then on these two
blocks<00:02:41.020> you<00:02:41.200> want<00:02:41.290> to<00:02:41.440> have<00:02:41.560> redstone<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:42.550> a

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
blocks you want to have redstone and a

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.810 
blocks you want to have redstone and a
comparator<00:02:44.110> facing<00:02:44.650> that<00:02:44.770> way<00:02:44.950> make<00:02:45.610> sure

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
comparator facing that way make sure

I put 18-year 11 and seven more and then

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:10.589 
I put 18-year 11 and seven more and then
you<00:06:08.720> want<00:06:08.900> to<00:06:08.960> have<00:06:09.110> the<00:06:09.440> rest<00:06:09.620> right<00:06:09.770> there

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:10.599 
you want to have the rest right there

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:13.629 
you want to have the rest right there
now<00:06:11.599> the<00:06:11.659> last<00:06:11.900> one<00:06:12.139> I<00:06:12.169> want<00:06:12.440> is<00:06:12.560> sound<00:06:12.800> so

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:13.639 
now the last one I want is sound so

now the last one I want is sound so
you're<00:06:13.729> gonna<00:06:13.819> put<00:06:14.060> 18<00:06:14.449> sand<00:06:14.720> in<00:06:14.810> here<00:06:16.720> 9<00:06:18.220> and

then you want to put their best one each

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:28.029 
then you want to put their best one each
another<00:06:23.360> way<00:06:23.569> this<00:06:23.690> works<00:06:23.960> is<00:06:26.500> 22<00:06:27.500> blocks<00:06:27.800> with

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:28.039 
another way this works is 22 blocks with

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:33.129 
another way this works is 22 blocks with
1892<00:06:28.969> yes<00:06:29.870> so<00:06:30.050> 22<00:06:30.560> blocks<00:06:30.969> gives<00:06:31.969> one<00:06:32.659> signal

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:33.139 
1892 yes so 22 blocks gives one signal

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:36.399 
1892 yes so 22 blocks gives one signal
if<00:06:33.770> you<00:06:33.979> add<00:06:34.219> another<00:06:34.490> block<00:06:34.729> 23<00:06:35.449> it<00:06:36.080> gives<00:06:36.259> out

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:36.409 
if you add another block 23 it gives out

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:38.830 
if you add another block 23 it gives out
a<00:06:36.440> second<00:06:36.889> signal<00:06:37.280> of<00:06:38.000> the<00:06:38.240> comparator<00:06:38.690> and

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:38.840 
a second signal of the comparator and

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.379 
a second signal of the comparator and
the<00:06:39.440> second<00:06:39.800> signal<00:06:39.949> power<00:06:40.460> is<00:06:40.729> this<00:06:40.940> repeater

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:41.389 
the second signal power is this repeater

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:45.610 
the second signal power is this repeater
to<00:06:41.800> turn<00:06:42.800> off<00:06:43.069> this<00:06:43.940> torch<00:06:44.270> that<00:06:45.199> won't<00:06:45.409> allow

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:45.620 
to turn off this torch that won't allow

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:46.950 
to turn off this torch that won't allow
it<00:06:45.740> to<00:06:45.830> go<00:06:45.949> into<00:06:46.099> the<00:06:46.219> chest

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960 
it to go into the chest

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.170 
it to go into the chest
so<00:06:47.960> now<00:06:48.050> let's<00:06:48.229> test<00:06:48.379> it<00:06:48.530> out<00:06:48.729> let's<00:06:49.729> put<00:06:49.940> some

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:50.180 
so now let's test it out let's put some

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.129 
so now let's test it out let's put some
of<00:06:51.110> this<00:06:51.530> in<00:06:51.770> and<00:06:52.300> let's<00:06:53.300> just<00:06:53.449> cut<00:06:53.900> this<00:06:53.990> in

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:54.139 
of this in and let's just cut this in

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:55.240 
of this in and let's just cut this in
half<00:06:54.169> because<00:06:54.409> we<00:06:54.530> don't<00:06:54.830> want<00:06:54.949> that<00:06:55.069> much

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:55.250 
half because we don't want that much

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.629 
half because we don't want that much
stuff<00:06:55.460> that<00:06:55.849> takes<00:06:56.389> you<00:06:56.479> along

00:06:57.629 --> 00:06:57.639 
stuff that takes you along

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:01.409 
stuff that takes you along
I<00:06:57.960> cut<00:06:58.960> this<00:06:59.050> in<00:06:59.199> half<00:06:59.229> -<00:06:59.530> and<00:06:59.770> then<00:07:00.669> you'll<00:07:01.300> see

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:01.419 
I cut this in half - and then you'll see

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:03.149 
I cut this in half - and then you'll see
what<00:07:01.539> happens<00:07:01.569> so<00:07:02.499> you<00:07:02.530> got<00:07:02.680> your<00:07:02.770> sand<00:07:02.979> in

00:07:03.149 --> 00:07:03.159 
what happens so you got your sand in

00:07:03.159 --> 00:07:07.140 
what happens so you got your sand in
here<00:07:04.319> then<00:07:05.319> your<00:07:05.639> cobblestone<00:07:06.639> should<00:07:06.969> be<00:07:07.060> in

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:07.150 
here then your cobblestone should be in

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:11.100 
here then your cobblestone should be in
this<00:07:07.240> one<00:07:07.620> and<00:07:08.639> then<00:07:09.639> you<00:07:09.669> have<00:07:09.909> your<00:07:10.180> dough<00:07:10.930> in
