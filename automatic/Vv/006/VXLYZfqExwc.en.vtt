 Ferrari update to what many 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.710
 they expected this update that the 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.720
 it really improved pretty much as they see good 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.050

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.400
 costume 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.390
 we see that they are different here and the menu 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:39.180
 already gives you for 6 before it was for only 3 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.059
 just up here, it gives you that the 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:46.740
 spaces and also the characters 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:49.850
 here the npc or as they are called are already more 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:52.350

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.200
 things to see here the wings that 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.150
 they have 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.050
 and well let's try let's see a 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.570
 little bit of map as you see 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:05.940
 because the color is already quite the same 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:08.350
 they are a chair 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.470
 as we see behind the background they look like 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.119
 a rock france is different the truth 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.010
 that this update because he liked it 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:19.240
 to the console 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:21.900
 here we see this shit I am not that it is not 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.900
 I have space 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.950
 lead mineral wow 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.799
 see also the weapons is now the 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.560
 tizona is already different the same is the 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:36.040
 fury of stars like they changed a 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:39.130
 little its appearance here this material at 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:42.060
 brick equal this tin ore and 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.860
 tuxtla mineral 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.579
 and well the truth is this game was 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:51.110
 pretty cool I think when I 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:55.160
 buy then it was tainted and moa and 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.060
 and from there I did not play but 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.590
 well there it is with this update 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.180
 I think I'll go back to the banderillas 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.510
 but I will try to play then from scratch not 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.870
 so that it is more entertaining but so 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.630
 that exists 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:13.300
 if you have not bought this game 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.030
 I know what you do with your life the net I do not know a 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.950
 What do you do 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.250
 I see here these bricks removed them makes 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.250
 little while 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.659
 although here is a cave 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.430
 I 'm not complaining is the answer 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:37.830
 everything is an egg cave 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.920
 see those little flags that you see there 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.920
 above 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.430
 Grant has chest or mask of Pharaoh 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.790
 as they see when it moves like that 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:54.890
 I did not see the style differently 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:59.140
 here I do not know what 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:02.100
 and pharaoh's tunic to see let's see 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:07.280
 at a virtual medium heat 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.280
 when they have an attack here for nothing 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:14.950
 It has very little good to see the truth 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.950
 the dragon costume is different too 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:24.210
 but then if this is the update 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.910
 fresh out of the oven 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:29.420
 that for truth is very well brings a 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:33.140
 good of things brings new new bosses 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.140
 armor as we saw 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:41.940
 and then new accessories new pets 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.940
 new nfc characters of those guys 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.630
 I liked the truth it does not have 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.770
 a lot of time to play but I liked it 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.960
 As I say, I'm going to start from scratch 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.840
 see torches as they look and 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:56.300
 placed there is no cause there but already 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.790
 They look different is not like before 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.950
 all looked cold 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.170
 also the biomes that are the biomes 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.049
 are these things the scenario change 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:09.079
 see here ice as it looks is already 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:12.129
 different this that is not not left 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:12.129
 I grab something 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.430
 block of ice very well since everything is 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.470
 different also I think there was going to be 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.500
 new chests and new things like that no more 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:26.780
 interesting things 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:30.819
 I was thrilled to see this equal the area 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.819
 corrupt, it changes a lot, it's no longer 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.900
 like before 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:43.050
 it's already different so it 's more red 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:46.000
 it's fine there there are ice picks me 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:49.180
 fall pasting 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.610
 water and also like running is a 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.220
 little faster when you run no longer see 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.590
 for example there is the suburb but there is the 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:00.400
 yours without jumping 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:02.830
 this is ice I can not advance 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.270
 although in Carla but see here already what 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.180
 I can support him killer with these 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.730
 thick ones that used to get stuck 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:12.100
 you just run and do not occupy to jump 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:14.600
