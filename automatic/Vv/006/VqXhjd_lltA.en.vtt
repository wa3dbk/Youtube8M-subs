00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
created a new much smaller lightning

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.759 
created a new much smaller lightning
connector<00:00:57.089> it's<00:00:57.690> all<00:00:57.870> digital<00:00:58.080> so<00:00:58.470> you<00:00:58.589> know

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
connector it's all digital so you know

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:00.440 
connector it's all digital so you know
it<00:00:59.040> replaced<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.489> ancient<00:00:59.879> technology<00:01:00.360> in

it replaced that ancient technology in
the<00:01:00.539> previous<00:01:00.899> connector<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.500> it's

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:01.950 
the previous connector and it's

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.709 
the previous connector and it's
reversible<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:02.850> can<00:01:03.030> use<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.300> either<00:01:03.420> way

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
reversible so you can use it either way
