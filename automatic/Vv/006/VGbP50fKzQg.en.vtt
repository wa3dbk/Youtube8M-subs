00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
so this menu is specific to my face or

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.350 
so this menu is specific to my face or

this is a different menu here so it

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.970 
this is a different menu here so it
really<00:02:46.299> just<00:02:46.569> depends<00:02:46.930> on<00:02:47.109> which<00:02:47.319> application

really just depends on which application
you're<00:02:48.099> in<00:02:48.250> so<00:02:48.459> though<00:02:48.609> so<00:02:48.849> the<00:02:48.970> device<00:02:49.239> is

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
you're in so though so the device is

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:50.580
