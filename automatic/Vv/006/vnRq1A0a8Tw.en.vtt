00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
think both systems equally have their

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.490 
think both systems equally have their
own<00:01:26.610> problems<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.540> right<00:01:28.229> now<00:01:28.439> the

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.530 
his name i think it was GOI i don't
think<00:02:16.680> this<00:02:16.800> is<00:02:16.860> directly<00:02:17.640> related<00:02:17.910> to<00:02:18.210> him

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
think this is directly related to him

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.230 
think this is directly related to him
but<00:02:19.380> i<00:02:19.440> would<00:02:19.680> have<00:02:19.710> to<00:02:19.860> say<00:02:20.040> what<00:02:20.700> he<00:02:20.970> did

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
but i would have to say what he did

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.990 
but i would have to say what he did
probably<00:02:21.570> open<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.410> doors<00:02:22.620> for<00:02:22.980> all<00:02:23.580> of<00:02:23.760> this

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
probably open the doors for all of this

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.070 
probably open the doors for all of this
and<00:02:25.550> the<00:02:26.550> guys<00:02:26.730> that<00:02:27.000> did<00:02:27.060> it<00:02:27.480> they<00:02:27.780> may<00:02:28.050> have

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
and the guys that did it they may have

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.410 
and the guys that did it they may have
done<00:02:28.410> it<00:02:28.560> just<00:02:29.190> like<00:02:29.340> a<00:02:29.550> lot<00:02:29.760> of<00:02:29.880> hackers<00:02:30.270> I

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
done it just like a lot of hackers I

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.870 
done it just like a lot of hackers I
think<00:02:30.660> they<00:02:30.810> do<00:02:31.110> stuff<00:02:31.380> like<00:02:31.500> that<00:02:31.650> just<00:02:32.100> to

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
think they do stuff like that just to

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.090 
think they do stuff like that just to
see<00:02:33.150> if<00:02:33.300> they<00:02:33.450> can<00:02:33.660> do<00:02:33.810> it<00:02:33.840> you<00:02:34.350> know<00:02:34.500> I<00:02:34.740> don't

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
see if they can do it you know I don't

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.190 
see if they can do it you know I don't
think<00:02:35.550> they<00:02:35.670> necessarily<00:02:35.850> go<00:02:36.630> into<00:02:37.020> it<00:02:37.170> with

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
think they necessarily go into it with

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.890 
think they necessarily go into it with
bad<00:02:37.770> intentions<00:02:38.580> I<00:02:38.790> think<00:02:39.300> they<00:02:39.390> just<00:02:39.540> want<00:02:39.810> to

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
bad intentions I think they just want to

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.250 
bad intentions I think they just want to
see<00:02:40.080> if<00:02:40.320> they<00:02:40.710> can<00:02:40.920> do<00:02:41.070> it<00:02:41.100> and<00:02:42.050> this<00:02:43.050> is

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
see if they can do it and this is

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.470 
see if they can do it and this is
probably<00:02:43.530> an<00:02:43.920> instance<00:02:44.310> where<00:02:44.430> I<00:02:44.580> don't<00:02:45.030> think

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
probably an instance where I don't think

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.230 
probably an instance where I don't think
they<00:02:46.170> were<00:02:46.230> you<00:02:47.220> know<00:02:47.250> intentionally<00:02:47.970> trying

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
they were you know intentionally trying

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.330 
they were you know intentionally trying
to<00:02:48.330> get<00:02:48.540> into<00:02:48.690> this<00:02:48.900> network<00:02:49.410> to<00:02:50.040> cause

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
to get into this network to cause

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.940 
to get into this network to cause
problems<00:02:51.090> they<00:02:52.020> just<00:02:52.200> wanted<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:52.560> see<00:02:52.770> if<00:02:52.800> it

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
problems they just wanted to see if it

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.030 
problems they just wanted to see if it
could<00:02:52.980> be<00:02:53.130> done<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.790> now<00:02:54.330> that<00:02:54.600> it's<00:02:54.750> done<00:02:55.050> you

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
could be done and now that it's done you

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.210 
could be done and now that it's done you
know<00:02:56.190> Sony<00:02:56.550> said<00:02:57.000> oh<00:02:57.420> shit<00:02:57.960> we<00:02:58.380> got<00:02:58.590> closes

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
user ID on the PlayStation 3 I think

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.290 
user ID on the PlayStation 3 I think
when<00:03:46.800> the<00:03:46.890> map<00:03:47.070> packs<00:03:47.340> came<00:03:47.640> out<00:03:47.820> from<00:03:48.060> model

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
when the map packs came out from model

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.080 
when the map packs came out from model
142<00:03:48.630> I<00:03:48.810> bought<00:03:49.140> them<00:03:49.380> and<00:03:49.590> I<00:03:50.070> did<00:03:50.310> so<00:03:50.550> by<00:03:50.760> going

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
142 I bought them and I did so by going

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.610 
142 I bought them and I did so by going
through<00:03:51.270> the<00:03:51.660> store<00:03:51.870> and<00:03:52.080> buying<00:03:52.260> one<00:03:52.590> of

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
through the store and buying one of

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.650 
through the store and buying one of
those<00:03:52.740> twenty<00:03:53.160> dollar<00:03:53.630> playstation<00:03:54.630> network

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
those twenty dollar playstation network

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.020 
those twenty dollar playstation network
cards<00:03:55.350> and<00:03:55.560> I<00:03:55.860> think<00:03:56.310> that<00:03:56.520> is<00:03:56.550> really<00:03:56.880> the

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
cards and I think that is really the

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.410 
cards and I think that is really the
best<00:03:57.150> way<00:03:57.510> to<00:03:57.660> do<00:03:57.990> all<00:03:58.290> of<00:03:58.320> this<00:03:58.620> online<00:03:59.070> gaming

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
best way to do all of this online gaming

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.600 
best way to do all of this online gaming
even<00:04:00.420> on<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:00.600> xbox<00:04:01.050> I<00:04:01.260> do<00:04:01.380> not<00:04:01.920> have<00:04:02.220> any

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610
