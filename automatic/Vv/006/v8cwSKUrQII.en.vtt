now return zero below for that fire the
shutter<00:02:58.690> and<00:02:59.640> I<00:03:00.640> put<00:03:00.880> a<00:03:00.910> wine<00:03:01.209> and<00:03:01.720> fire<00:03:02.290> three

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
shutter and I put a wine and fire three

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:13.620 
shutter and I put a wine and fire three
times<00:03:03.220> one<00:03:06.360> two<00:03:09.480> three<00:03:10.590> you<00:03:11.590> learn<00:03:11.920> not<00:03:12.519> to<00:03:12.910> do

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
times one two three you learn not to do

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.180 
times one two three you learn not to do
this<00:03:13.780> once<00:03:14.049> more

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
this once more

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.170 
this once more
and<00:03:17.190> I<00:03:17.340> know<00:03:17.550> the<00:03:17.820> dots<00:03:18.200> between<00:03:19.610> not<00:03:20.610> a<00:03:20.910> tune

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
and I know the dots between not a tune

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.140 
and I know the dots between not a tune
which<00:03:21.540> is<00:03:21.720> obviously<00:03:22.110> number<00:03:22.590> one<00:03:22.800> and<00:03:23.150> I'm

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
which is obviously number one and I'm

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.720 
which is obviously number one and I'm
ready<00:03:24.390> to<00:03:24.510> take<00:03:24.810> my<00:03:25.020> first<00:03:25.260> pitch<00:03:25.620> I<00:03:25.950> have

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
ready to take my first pitch I have

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.120 
ready to take my first pitch I have
major<00:03:26.970> success<00:03:27.510> and<00:03:28.110> there<00:03:28.320> will<00:03:28.500> be<00:03:28.530> no<00:03:28.830> space

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
major success and there will be no space

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.850 
major success and there will be no space
impossible
