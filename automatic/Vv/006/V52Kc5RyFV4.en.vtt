00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
made me want to even more so I thought

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.320

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.049 
10 spring makeup and product pics but
it's<00:00:31.529> going<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.710> be<00:00:31.800> in<00:00:31.890> two<00:00:32.099> halves<00:00:32.399> because

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
it's going to be in two halves because

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.030 
it's going to be in two halves because
my<00:00:33.210> camera<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:33.660> ridiculous<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.380> will<00:00:34.770> let<00:00:34.890> me

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
my camera is ridiculous and will let me

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.799 
my camera is ridiculous and will let me
record<00:00:35.340> 48<00:00:35.700> minutes<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.239> half<00:00:36.510> at<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.780> time

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
record 48 minutes and a half at a time

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.560 
record 48 minutes and a half at a time
so<00:00:37.739> until<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:38.070> sort<00:00:38.370> out<00:00:38.640> most<00:00:38.969> videos<00:00:39.390> will<00:00:39.540> be

so until I sort out most videos will be

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.660 
so until I sort out most videos will be
in<00:00:39.719> two<00:00:39.899> parts<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:40.920> I'm<00:00:40.980> going<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.160> do<00:00:41.250> makeup

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
like everyone goes on about this but it

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.510 
like everyone goes on about this but it
really<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:27.869> as<00:01:28.170> good<00:01:28.470> as<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.710> height<00:01:28.920> claims<00:01:29.280> to

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.700 
be I think it's perfect for spring maybe
because<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.390> feels<00:01:33.630> really<00:01:33.900> light<00:01:33.990> on<00:01:34.500> the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
because it feels really light on the

actually<00:02:26.860> a<00:02:27.100> pipe<00:02:27.310> of<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.550> fingers<00:02:27.970> so<00:02:28.150> I

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
actually a pipe of the fingers so I

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.090 
actually a pipe of the fingers so I
would<00:02:28.360> recommend<00:02:28.720> you<00:02:29.050> use<00:02:29.590> some<00:02:29.830> sort<00:02:29.860> of

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
would recommend you use some sort of

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.100 
would recommend you use some sort of
brush<00:02:30.370> to<00:02:30.610> apply<00:02:30.640> it<00:02:30.910> and<00:02:31.210> it<00:02:31.690> does<00:02:31.870> give<00:02:32.080> a

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
brush to apply it and it does give a

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.440 
brush to apply it and it does give a
nice<00:02:32.320> airbrushed<00:02:32.890> finish<00:02:32.980> and<00:02:33.550> even<00:02:34.270> though

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
nice airbrushed finish and even though

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.380 
nice airbrushed finish and even though
it's<00:02:34.750> light<00:02:35.290> sort<00:02:36.010> of<00:02:36.100> full<00:02:36.430> spring<00:02:36.760> it<00:02:37.090> gives

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
it's light sort of full spring it gives

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.910 
it's light sort of full spring it gives
a<00:02:37.480> really<00:02:37.510> good<00:02:37.930> medium<00:02:38.260> coverage<00:02:38.680> like

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
a really good medium coverage like

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.470 
a really good medium coverage like
covers<00:02:39.250> everything<00:02:39.490> up<00:02:39.760> I<00:02:39.910> wouldn't<00:02:40.210> want<00:02:40.360> to

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
covers everything up I wouldn't want to

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.880

have gone on bought them just because

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.110 
have gone on bought them just because
I'm<00:03:22.810> quite<00:03:23.050> a<00:03:23.080> matte<00:03:23.590> lip<00:03:24.160> sort<00:03:24.520> of<00:03:24.610> girl<00:03:24.880> would

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
I'm quite a matte lip sort of girl would

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.880 
I'm quite a matte lip sort of girl would
do<00:03:25.300> quite<00:03:25.540> like<00:03:25.570> you<00:03:25.930> know<00:03:26.050> burst<00:03:26.470> of<00:03:26.650> color

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
do quite like you know burst of color

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.950 
do quite like you know burst of color
that<00:03:27.100> lasts<00:03:27.280> for<00:03:27.490> quite<00:03:27.520> a<00:03:27.670> long<00:03:27.730> time<00:03:27.850> and<00:03:28.420> I

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:28.960 
that lasts for quite a long time and I

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.360 
that lasts for quite a long time and I
thought<00:03:29.170> this<00:03:29.380> would<00:03:29.440> just<00:03:29.650> be<00:03:29.770> like<00:03:29.830> a<00:03:29.980> tinted

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
thought this would just be like a tinted

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.580 
thought this would just be like a tinted
lip<00:03:30.550> balm<00:03:30.790> and<00:03:31.150> I<00:03:31.660> do<00:03:31.720> like<00:03:32.170> a<00:03:32.200> bit<00:03:32.440> more

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
lip balm and I do like a bit more

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.680 
lip balm and I do like a bit more
pigmentation<00:03:33.490> than<00:03:33.670> that<00:03:33.880> but<00:03:34.270> they're<00:03:34.480> just

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
pigmentation than that but they're just

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.180 
pigmentation than that but they're just
so<00:03:34.810> much<00:03:34.960> more<00:03:35.020> than<00:03:35.350> that<00:03:35.440> I<00:03:35.500> would<00:03:35.740> say<00:03:35.920> there

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
so much more than that I would say there

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.030

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.630 
brush brush and i put this on the apples
of<00:07:09.270> my<00:07:09.330> cheeks<00:07:09.450> and<00:07:10.040> and<00:07:11.040> then<00:07:11.460> you'd

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:11.640 
of my cheeks and and then you'd

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.670 
of my cheeks and and then you'd
everything<00:07:12.060> to<00:07:12.150> highlight<00:07:12.570> and<00:07:12.780> it's<00:07:13.500> good

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 
everything to highlight and it's good

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.560 
everything to highlight and it's good
for<00:07:13.710> spring<00:07:14.190> because<00:07:14.670> you<00:07:15.060> can<00:07:15.180> probably<00:07:15.330> see

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:15.570 
for spring because you can probably see

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:18.620 
for spring because you can probably see
it's<00:07:15.750> not<00:07:16.160> that<00:07:17.160> pigmented<00:07:17.850> I<00:07:18.000> it<00:07:18.060> was<00:07:18.330> a<00:07:18.360> bit

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:18.630 
it's not that pigmented I it was a bit

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:20.480 
it's not that pigmented I it was a bit
so<00:07:19.110> I<00:07:19.140> can't<00:07:19.380> or<00:07:19.530> even<00:07:19.770> really<00:07:19.980> get<00:07:20.070> any<00:07:20.280> color

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:20.490 
so I can't or even really get any color

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.360 
so I can't or even really get any color
out<00:07:21.260> and<00:07:22.260> I<00:07:22.320> wasn't<00:07:22.650> it<00:07:22.710> just<00:07:22.770> pointed<00:07:23.250> with

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:23.370 
out and I wasn't it just pointed with

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:27.640 
out and I wasn't it just pointed with
that<00:07:23.550> at<00:07:24.210> first<00:07:24.510> very<00:07:25.550> light<00:07:26.550> switch<00:07:27.300> there

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:27.650 
that at first very light switch there

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.980 
that at first very light switch there
but<00:07:28.650> for<00:07:29.040> spring<00:07:29.840> especially<00:07:30.840> if<00:07:30.900> you're

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:30.990 
but for spring especially if you're

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:34.310 
but for spring especially if you're
using<00:07:31.020> another<00:07:31.440> hum<00:07:32.040> blush<00:07:32.970> on<00:07:33.150> top<00:07:33.480> you<00:07:34.110> don't

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:34.320 
using another hum blush on top you don't

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.640 
using another hum blush on top you don't
really<00:07:34.560> want<00:07:34.920> like<00:07:35.510> bright<00:07:36.510> bright<00:07:37.200> cheeks
