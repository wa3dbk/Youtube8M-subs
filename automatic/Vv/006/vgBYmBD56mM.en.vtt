00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.080
 the only thing is that as I go 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.220
 wearing we will lose them 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.800
 you will have to re-enter the mission 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.240
 to be able to have them again the only thing 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.430
 you have to have is a colleague to 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.770
 hand and download the link that I 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.240
 I will leave in the description good they went down 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.100

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.630
 enter that link and it will take you to the 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.640
 rockstar page that you are watching 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.860
 top left once between 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.690
 they what you have to do is make 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.759
 may this party appear in your 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.979
 play like I'm doing this 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.050
 precise moment once you give it and 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.500
 appear on your play one enters the 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.180
 Mission invites a friend and when 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.220
 He has invited the colleague and we have 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.930
 entered the mission you will realize 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.119
 that we have created them with all the weapons 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.100
 directly on the ground then what 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.570
 The only thing you will have to do is collect 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.390
 all the weapons that are on the ground 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.159
 give upwards the crosshead for 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.470
 take out the mobile we will remove the mobile 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.440
 we will enter the missions and 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.180
 we will abandon the mission from the mobile 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.820
 I repeat it is important we have to 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.200
 abandon the mission from the mobile one 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.360
 time when we have the mission from the 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.180
 mobile we will go back to online mode and 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.820
 we will have all the weapons that 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.560
 we have collected in the game this is 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.880
 say all the important ones because os 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.250
 let's leave all the weapons 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.980
 important in the game 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.630
 so it's a real last the only 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.370
 problem is that once you get 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.600
 spend the branches you have to go back to 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.210
 enter the mission to return to 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.880
 replace them but there are so many that 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.110
 It's going to take a while to spend the 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.300
 all and the truth is to enter and 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.250
 take it I've seen that it's a minute a 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.709
 once you have the game saved in 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.030
 your play so nothing guys I hope 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.010
 that you like because the trick is a 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.500
 true past I hope you like it 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.500

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.480
 This is what life sounds like a bitch 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:21.620

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.799
 you never know you never know what you're going to 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.799
