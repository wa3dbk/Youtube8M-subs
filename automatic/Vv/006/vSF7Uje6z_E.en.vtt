infrastructure<00:02:15.600> not<00:02:16.380> just<00:02:16.680> because<00:02:16.980> it's

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
infrastructure not just because it's

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.309 
infrastructure not just because it's
critical<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.670> trade<00:02:17.940> or<00:02:18.720> because<00:02:19.050> it<00:02:19.200> keeps

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
critical to trade or because it keeps

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.920 
critical to trade or because it keeps
prices<00:02:19.620> low<00:02:20.040> but<00:02:20.970> because<00:02:21.090> it<00:02:21.480> keeps<00:02:21.690> the

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
prices low but because it keeps the

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.380 
prices low but because it keeps the
United<00:02:22.230> States<00:02:22.470> competitive<00:02:23.160> strong<00:02:24.060> and
