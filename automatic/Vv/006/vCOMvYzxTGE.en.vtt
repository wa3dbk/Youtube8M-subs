see right here this box is not very high
off<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.860> ground<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.759> lip<00:00:14.969> there's<00:00:15.480> not<00:00:15.780> that

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
right back into the snow it's a small

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.430 
right back into the snow it's a small
box<00:00:44.760> like<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:45.239> like<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:45.989> said<00:00:46.140> it's<00:00:46.289> going

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
box like this is like I said it's going

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
fundamentals of sliding the box

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.110 
fundamentals of sliding the box
keeping<00:00:50.010> your<00:00:50.100> body<00:00:50.250> position<00:00:50.730> properly

coming off properly and getting on
properly<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.030> it's<00:00:54.300> going<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.449> make<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.750> so

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
properly and it's going to make it so

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.930 
properly and it's going to make it so
it's<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.140> lot<00:00:55.320> easier<00:00:55.350> if<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.250> do<00:00:56.460> fall<00:00:56.760> and

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
it's a lot easier if you do fall and

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.430 
it's a lot easier if you do fall and
slip<00:00:57.149> out<00:00:57.270> it's<00:00:57.510> not<00:00:57.660> gonna<00:00:57.840> hurt<00:00:58.140> his<00:00:58.289> back

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
slip out it's not gonna hurt his back

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.630 
slip out it's not gonna hurt his back
because<00:00:58.710> it's<00:00:58.829> not<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.160> high<00:00:59.370> off<00:00:59.489> the

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
because it's not that high off the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.670 
because it's not that high off the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
make sure you keep your weight balanced

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.920 
make sure you keep your weight balanced
throughout<00:01:29.909> so<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.180> don't<00:01:30.390> slip<00:01:30.570> out<00:01:30.750> and

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
throughout so you don't slip out and

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.080 
throughout so you don't slip out and
catch<00:01:31.110> your<00:01:31.229> front<00:01:31.500> edge

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.320 

it's<00:01:34.990> been<00:01:35.080> a<00:01:35.110> hop<00:01:35.380> sideway<00:01:35.860> and<00:01:36.130> then<00:01:37.060> hop

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
it's been a hop sideway and then hop

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:43.380 
it's been a hop sideway and then hop
regular<00:01:37.870> again<00:01:41.729> so<00:01:42.729> as<00:01:42.850> you<00:01:43.000> notice<00:01:43.270> right

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
regular again so as you notice right

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.469 
regular again so as you notice right
there<00:01:43.450> I<00:01:43.780> hop<00:01:44.140> sideways<00:01:44.710> I<00:01:45.010> crouch<00:01:45.940> down<00:01:46.060> low

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
there I hop sideways I crouch down low

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.270 
there I hop sideways I crouch down low
so<00:01:46.750> I<00:01:46.810> was<00:01:46.960> in<00:01:47.050> a<00:01:47.110> proper<00:01:47.470> stance<00:01:47.710> on<00:01:47.920> the<00:01:48.070> box

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
so I was in a proper stance on the box

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.460 
so I was in a proper stance on the box
and<00:01:48.729> then<00:01:49.030> I<00:01:49.120> came<00:01:49.180> back<00:01:49.420> forward<00:01:50.110> like<00:01:50.260> that

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
and then I came back forward like that

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.520 
and then I came back forward like that
it<00:01:50.920> helps<00:01:51.460> to<00:01:51.670> get<00:01:52.060> to<00:01:52.270> when<00:01:53.140> you're<00:01:53.320> sliding

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
it helps to get to when you're sliding

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.050 
it helps to get to when you're sliding
sideways<00:01:53.890> if<00:01:54.160> your<00:01:54.280> body<00:01:54.490> is<00:01:54.670> still<00:01:54.850> a<00:01:54.880> little

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
sideways if your body is still a little

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.120 
sideways if your body is still a little
bit<00:01:55.270> forward<00:01:55.690> just<00:01:55.900> because<00:01:56.380> they'll<00:01:56.830> make<00:01:57.010> it

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
bit forward just because they'll make it

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.590 
bit forward just because they'll make it
so<00:01:57.250> you<00:01:57.310> can<00:01:57.430> bring<00:01:57.610> your<00:01:57.700> body<00:01:57.850> forward<00:01:58.030> again

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
so you can bring your body forward again

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.960 
so you can bring your body forward again
so<00:01:59.140> you<00:01:59.200> can<00:01:59.350> go<00:01:59.500> back<00:01:59.710> down<00:01:59.890> the<00:02:00.040> hill<00:02:00.190> if<00:02:00.850> you

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
so you can go back down the hill if you

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.150 
so you can go back down the hill if you
get<00:02:01.150> completely<00:02:01.600> sideways<00:02:01.869> sometimes<00:02:02.710> it

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
get completely sideways sometimes it

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.570 
get completely sideways sometimes it
gets<00:02:03.310> difficult<00:02:04.260> to<00:02:05.340> bring<00:02:06.340> your<00:02:06.460> body

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
gets difficult to bring your body

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.130 
gets difficult to bring your body
forward<00:02:06.729> and<00:02:07.240> you'll<00:02:07.479> end<00:02:07.630> up<00:02:07.690> coming<00:02:08.050> out

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
forward and you'll end up coming out

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.350 
forward and you'll end up coming out
backwards<00:02:08.350> which<00:02:08.920> it's<00:02:09.790> good<00:02:10.000> to<00:02:10.090> come<00:02:10.209> up

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
backwards which it's good to come up

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.670 
backwards which it's good to come up
backwards<00:02:10.509> if<00:02:10.810> you're<00:02:10.929> mean<00:02:11.110> to<00:02:11.380> but<00:02:11.590> if

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
backwards if you're mean to but if

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.830 
backwards if you're mean to but if
you're<00:02:11.830> not<00:02:11.980> meaning<00:02:12.370> to<00:02:12.400> then<00:02:13.360> it<00:02:13.510> can<00:02:13.810> just

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
you're not meaning to then it can just

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.750 
you're not meaning to then it can just
leave<00:02:14.170> it<00:02:14.410> to<00:02:14.590> you<00:02:14.890> falling<00:02:15.310> or<00:02:15.430> being<00:02:15.640> out<00:02:15.700> of

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
leave it to you falling or being out of

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.729 
leave it to you falling or being out of
control<00:02:15.970> so<00:02:16.780> you<00:02:16.840> want<00:02:17.080> to<00:02:17.140> be<00:02:17.230> able<00:02:17.350> to<00:02:17.440> pop

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
control so you want to be able to pop

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.890 
control so you want to be able to pop
back<00:02:17.950> forward<00:02:18.370> and<00:02:18.550> come<00:02:19.150> out<00:02:19.300> regular<00:02:19.690> again

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
back forward and come out regular again

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.580 
back forward and come out regular again
and<00:02:20.110> just<00:02:20.200> go<00:02:20.320> and<00:02:20.680> ski<00:02:20.920> the<00:02:20.950> rest<00:02:21.190> of<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.400> run
