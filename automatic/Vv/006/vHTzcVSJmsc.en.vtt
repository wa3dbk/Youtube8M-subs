00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
out of the program now go into torque

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.940 
out of the program now go into torque
there's<00:01:27.490> torque<00:01:30.179> it's<00:01:31.179> gonna<00:01:31.299> start<00:01:31.689> up<00:01:31.950> with

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
there's torque it's gonna start up with

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.310 
there's torque it's gonna start up with
your<00:01:33.369> gauge<00:01:33.609> right<00:01:33.909> there<00:01:34.210> let's<00:01:34.780> go<00:01:34.990> see<00:01:35.200> what
