00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
here the expelled butane from gravity is

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.210 
here the expelled butane from gravity is
up<00:04:15.580> here<00:04:15.850> if<00:04:15.940> I<00:04:16.030> put<00:04:16.060> a<00:04:16.270> plate<00:04:16.600> up<00:04:16.750> here<00:04:17.220> you

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
of the real snow that melts with a

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.780 
of the real snow that melts with a
lighter<00:04:58.750> the<00:04:59.620> gentleman<00:05:00.100> is<00:05:00.220> holding<00:05:00.610> his

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
lighter the gentleman is holding his

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:49.660 
okay the fumes are being caught up in

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.770 
okay the fumes are being caught up in
the<00:05:49.750> snow<00:05:49.990> smell<00:05:50.770> this<00:05:51.040> it<00:05:51.520> is<00:05:52.210> god-awful

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:52.780

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 
let's get our control smell that

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.480 
let's get our control smell that
god-awful<00:05:57.160> seems<00:05:57.940> snow<00:05:58.300> okay<00:05:59.250> alrighty<00:06:00.250> we

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490 
god-awful seems snow okay alrighty we

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.630 
god-awful seems snow okay alrighty we
take<00:06:00.700> the<00:06:00.820> snow<00:06:01.060> over<00:06:01.240> here<00:06:02.250> there's<00:06:03.250> no<00:06:03.310> black

take the snow over here there's no black
marks<00:06:04.090> and<00:06:04.240> it<00:06:04.300> actually<00:06:04.690> melts<00:06:05.020> after<00:06:05.170> a

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:05.350 
marks and it actually melts after a

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.890 
marks and it actually melts after a
while<00:06:06.000> the<00:06:07.000> tip<00:06:07.210> of<00:06:07.330> this<00:06:07.420> flame<00:06:07.690> is<00:06:07.870> the

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:07.900 
while the tip of this flame is the

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.020 
while the tip of this flame is the
hottest<00:06:08.170> point<00:06:08.560> it's<00:06:08.980> so<00:06:09.310> hot<00:06:09.550> that<00:06:09.760> when<00:06:09.880> it's

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:10.030 
hottest point it's so hot that when it's

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:11.520 
hottest point it's so hot that when it's
touching<00:06:10.270> the<00:06:10.480> snow<00:06:10.600> it's<00:06:11.020> skipping<00:06:11.290> the

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:11.530 
touching the snow it's skipping the

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.050 
touching the snow it's skipping the
melting<00:06:11.860> phase<00:06:12.070> and<00:06:12.250> evaporating<00:06:12.820> it's

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.060 
melting phase and evaporating it's

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.619 
melting phase and evaporating it's
called<00:06:13.270> sublimation

00:06:14.619 --> 00:06:14.629 
called sublimation

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:19.299 
called sublimation
the<00:06:14.990> black<00:06:15.349> is<00:06:15.830> the<00:06:16.990> butane<00:06:17.990> exhaust<00:06:18.469> the<00:06:18.979> soup

00:06:19.299 --> 00:06:19.309 
the black is the butane exhaust the soup

00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:21.010 
the black is the butane exhaust the soup
from<00:06:19.490> the<00:06:19.550> butane<00:06:20.059> being<00:06:20.330> caught<00:06:20.629> in<00:06:20.779> the<00:06:20.869> ice

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
from the butane being caught in the ice

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.980 
from the butane being caught in the ice
crystals<00:06:21.729> okay<00:06:22.729> and<00:06:23.089> then<00:06:23.389> if<00:06:23.569> you<00:06:23.629> put<00:06:23.809> it<00:06:23.899> on

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:23.990 
crystals okay and then if you put it on

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.290 
crystals okay and then if you put it on
a<00:06:24.020> low<00:06:24.259> heat<00:06:24.520> because<00:06:25.520> the<00:06:25.550> extreme<00:06:26.059> heat

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:26.300 
a low heat because the extreme heat

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.510 
a low heat because the extreme heat
isn't<00:06:26.479> there<00:06:26.779> it<00:06:27.529> will<00:06:27.709> actually<00:06:27.860> melt<00:06:28.279> take

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:28.520 
isn't there it will actually melt take

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.219 
isn't there it will actually melt take
this<00:06:28.669> and<00:06:28.879> sit<00:06:29.059> it<00:06:29.119> in<00:06:29.209> your<00:06:29.330> house<00:06:29.509> again

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:30.229 
this and sit it in your house again

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:32.409 
this and sit it in your house again
there's<00:06:31.159> no<00:06:31.339> doubt<00:06:31.550> that<00:06:31.759> there's<00:06:31.909> chemicals

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:32.419 
there's no doubt that there's chemicals

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:35.799 
there's no doubt that there's chemicals
in<00:06:32.539> here<00:06:32.719> from<00:06:33.759> what<00:06:34.759> was<00:06:34.909> being<00:06:35.089> sprayed<00:06:35.479> but

00:06:35.799 --> 00:06:35.809 
in here from what was being sprayed but

00:06:35.809 --> 00:06:37.269 
in here from what was being sprayed but
it's<00:06:35.899> not<00:06:36.020> making<00:06:36.259> this<00:06:36.439> snow<00:06:36.679> do<00:06:36.889> anything

00:06:37.269 --> 00:06:37.279 
it's not making this snow do anything

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:38.829 
it's not making this snow do anything
abnormal<00:06:37.429> it<00:06:37.879> would<00:06:37.999> do<00:06:38.149> it<00:06:38.270> if<00:06:38.360> it<00:06:38.449> was<00:06:38.569> any

00:06:38.829 --> 00:06:38.839 
abnormal it would do it if it was any

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:41.409 
abnormal it would do it if it was any
type<00:06:39.080> of<00:06:39.110> snow<00:06:39.469> so<00:06:40.429> hope<00:06:40.759> you<00:06:40.879> guys<00:06:41.029> enjoyed

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:41.419 
type of snow so hope you guys enjoyed

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:43.119 
type of snow so hope you guys enjoyed
that<00:06:41.449> and<00:06:41.809> this<00:06:41.899> was<00:06:42.020> my<00:06:42.169> last<00:06:42.349> snow<00:06:42.800> video

00:06:43.119 --> 00:06:43.129 
that and this was my last snow video

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:45.309 
that and this was my last snow video
because<00:06:43.610> it's<00:06:43.789> absolutely<00:06:44.479> nonsense<00:06:45.020> anymore

00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:45.319 
because it's absolutely nonsense anymore

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:49.240 
because it's absolutely nonsense anymore
and<00:06:46.219> I<00:06:46.429> hope<00:06:46.639> you<00:06:46.759> all<00:06:46.849> have<00:06:46.969> a<00:06:47.029> good<00:06:47.180> day
