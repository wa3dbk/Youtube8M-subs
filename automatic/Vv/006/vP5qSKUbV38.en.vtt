00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.179
 hello to all friends the massacres and 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.520
 rapes x and youtube Belgian time 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.529
 completely crazy and today I 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.500
 you presented an Arab word attempt 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.980
 allah mp5 so this is a weapon that has been 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.660
 a little bit 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.429
 so there had been patched that has a 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.929
 little bit improved good it's true 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.029
 it's still not tears the easiest 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.500
 of the game huh but hey she is no longer 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.810
 as bad as before 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.850
 and so it's a moab attempt of my 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.710
 brother on the mission map they use 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.900
 the specialist assets and on its mp5 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.210
 lamic concentration and silent I 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.850
 think as an accessory so that's nothing 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.550
 of goodness so I'm going to take advantage of 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.050
 this gameplay to talk to you about a subject 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.320
 which keeps me personally to 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.480
 heart so it's for the output of bo 2 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.460
 do you think they would be 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.469
 really useful for this game that there is 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.329
 a moab or a neck so I'm going 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.170
 explain to me why I say that this is 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.600
 because for me the neck the moab etc 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.640
 it still makes the camp for me 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.180
 because there are people playing 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.969
 their life to the max who are really going 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.460
 play their life by all means for 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.380
 do not die and just get this 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.080
 famous month bo this famous neck and 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.140
 you can not finally it's a debate 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.540
 give me you how to say give me 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.979
 your opinion but really confess 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.869
 that there are still a lot of 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.780
 people who play their life for 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.909
 get this 7 neck fashion on mw2 as soon 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.830
 that the person was her husband she 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.869
 was quickly hiding in a corner and c 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.119
 is to have his first his first 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.400
 that it's often they went into 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.920
 spots etc 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.030
 but hey I did not find that it's 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.369
 true that there are some who make necks and 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.470
 words before in how to say 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.909
 crowd rush that I do not say but y'en 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.649
 a lot as they do there for me 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.920
 how to say 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.570
 to camp and his epr finally they want 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.950
 to do moab and so for that they go 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.420
 use all means what so all 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.640
 the kanpe means are good all the 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.470
 all the kant spots are good and 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.880
 so it's true that it can 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.500
 rot a little the game now 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.240
 obviously as I say to players 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.340
 really very very good who make 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.719
 mojaves crowd rush it's like if my 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.430
 brother are you going to see he's going to let know 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.840
 really 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.330
 rhj what we do not not make 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.039
 camping and so on may be delaying a 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.840
 moment I do not know parker gameplay 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.130
 but you've already seen this beautiful shot of 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.740
 pub 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.970
 how to say on my channel ii who 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.500
 were made by my brother and you 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.920
 know that it's a person who refuses 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.250
 a lot 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.880
 so for this debate I will try to 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.670
 send it to me 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.870
 Community therefore not what this little it 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.400
 can advance the debate if there is 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.600
 even more people than the public 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.090
 that I currently have on my channel which 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.380
 react to this debate so for me 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.300
 frankly I tell you honestly 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.440
 I may have some 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.750
 bad reactions etc 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.360
 I think the words ab the necks 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.920
 favors the when I find that on 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.170
 black ops was like a little bit 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.670
 less kanpe since it's true taste 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.580
 and we want the dogs the blackbird and 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.560
 but go when we see the 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.390
 tactics that were put in place by 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.980
 how to say some of the times by 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.320
 some teams here on a tip of three 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.820
 month I do not criticize the game of equipped 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.080
 it's really a game 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.880
 of equipment I find the school for the purposes 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.680
 you have to know how to play in a team 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.540
 but when you have players who 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.550
 play support that sway you 20 a 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.350
 drone because that's their role and that 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.209
 you also swing ballistic jackets 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.580
 when you find yourself in front of that 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.900
 and you have people who have who have 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.760
 all ballistic jackets have all 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.820
 drones and so on and who play 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.620
 all for the guy for samoa betc and y to 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.480
 teams that really play that for 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.950
 a guy to hit him that myself and 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.080
 so this guy is going to put himself in a spot 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.400
 in an evolved corner in Ghana there are some 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.750
 does business decay here by has 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.310
 who arrive by the 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.680
 statistics will hold will I put you 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.180
 portable radars and it's good it's true 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.640
 hey he will make his death yeah that's right 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.530
 but admit that for people in 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.440
 face is not ultra fair play what I 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.060
 do not know we can very well we can very 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.410
 play the moab well with his team 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.930
 yes that helps you a little but in 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.370
 run kind otherwise I do not know when 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.890
 you see some very good players 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.200
 on w3 yes from time to time they 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.450
 take a ballistic drop by 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.519
 here and there and all that but it goes in 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.019
 the heap y I have already played against 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.299
 teams up to play but really 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:05.610
 really really disgusting what the 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:07.390
 guys that he finally got help from 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.250
 shameful way click 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.210
 I found there was no merit to 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.980
 what they do in their beautiful clothes 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.240
 frankly it was taking 10 days 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.860
 ballistic and stay in their corner at 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.180
 the imac computer to my right who's coming 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.609
 on the left I tap you a portable radars 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.650
 here then there like that finally it's 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.120
 incredible and it pushes people sometimes 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.380
 gold what are the people what is this 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.030
 they do to dislodge these people 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.470
 there they will play rpg go 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.990
 to send I mean it's a 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.580
 gear I already discussed this and I 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.820
 do not know what he would not want better 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:37.210
 than go as everyone says the 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.740
 mayor cod it's rating May 4 / code 4 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.520
 was not much and if I 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.620
 remember you had a little 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.130
 bombing you had your helicopter the 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.020
 drone 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.790
 and then you had not thirty six 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.440
 a thousand killstreaks and the game will carry 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.660
 better it was the best 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.520
 finally years killed with weapons what 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:55.140
 it was the best alarm that this 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:58.240
 had them that he is no and not there 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:01.500
 to camp to have this or that finally me 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.460
 I honestly think that a bo2 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.860
 besides apparently that's what will 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.540
 that's what will happen normally 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.190
 according to my information 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.350
 I'm not in the big ones either 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.930
 secrets of treyarch of activision etc 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:16.030
 well, that's what I do not know 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:20.169
 no more than you but apparently he 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:23.669
 there would be no moab and should not 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:26.110
 me but neck and I know that 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:29.229
 was going to displease some but for 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:31.660
 I think I'm happy that there 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:34.180
 is not me or neck on bo 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.220
 two because for me it favors the 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.990
 when I find that the only goal in 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.210
 a set part won the game and of 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.530
 play goals and so inevitably he 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.550
 the slayer must be objective 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.380
 player etc 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.890
 because it forms a whole it is a 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.180
 team but for me that's the real goal of 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:52.030
 play games like that it's 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.110
 win the game respecting a day 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.110
 goals etc. 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.280
 but here is necessarily if we have our 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.710
 killstreaks well it helps 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.870
 the team but not how to say play 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.669
 his life to have these famous killstreaks 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:06.750
 no no the main thing is to win the 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:09.609
 part playing for the team and that's 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:11.689
 we'll see you get his web 

00:06:09.609 --> 00:06:12.979
 so you see that there is still 

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:15.399
 not bad huh he does it's not a 

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:18.019
 gameplay or its purposes how to say 

00:06:15.399 --> 00:06:19.849
 yet there was raf kit during 

00:06:18.019 --> 00:06:21.019
 seventh place he told me about it I think 

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:23.899
 that there is rage quit because it 

00:06:21.019 --> 00:06:26.089
 inevitably when someone finally when 

00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:27.769
 people are not hen by a 

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:29.419
 nobody yet deserving because good 

00:06:27.769 --> 00:06:30.919
 it's a glass of the triple elimination of 

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:32.479
 who must have quit quit yet he did that 

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:34.549
 I MP5 ball so it's still 

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:36.319
 deserving so I know people 

00:06:34.549 --> 00:06:37.909
 do not stop who's stronger than that 

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:38.989
 you know it's the community you have 

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:41.269
 certainly often launched months 

00:06:38.989 --> 00:06:43.039
 baby that you did 0 1 or 2 he 

00:06:41.269 --> 00:06:45.649
 do not know me who will teach you 

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:47.119
 this so frankly do not hesitate 

00:06:45.649 --> 00:06:48.739
 debate in the comments said 

00:06:47.119 --> 00:06:51.919
 frankly if you would like you 

00:06:48.739 --> 00:06:53.919
 see a neck see a moab again or 

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:55.819
 end I do not know me anyway
