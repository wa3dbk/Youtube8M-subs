co-driver but the paint job had no
problems<00:04:06.050> at<00:04:06.140> all<00:04:06.230> and<00:04:06.440> I<00:04:07.370> think<00:04:07.640> on<00:04:07.700> the<00:04:07.730> third

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
problems at all and I think on the third

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.550 
problems at all and I think on the third
stage<00:04:08.330> after<00:04:08.780> third<00:04:08.990> stage<00:04:09.200> we<00:04:09.290> were<00:04:09.350> leading

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
stage after third stage we were leading

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.620 
stage after third stage we were leading
and<00:04:09.830> we<00:04:09.950> backed<00:04:10.640> off<00:04:10.850> a<00:04:10.880> little<00:04:11.030> bit<00:04:11.300> since

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
and we backed off a little bit since

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.870 
and we backed off a little bit since
then<00:04:11.810> and<00:04:12.050> trying<00:04:12.980> to<00:04:13.070> maintain<00:04:13.190> that<00:04:13.370> lead<00:04:13.700> so

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
then and trying to maintain that lead so

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.030 
then and trying to maintain that lead so
it's<00:04:14.030> going<00:04:14.150> well<00:04:14.360> for<00:04:14.540> us<00:04:14.600> the<00:04:15.530> blend<00:04:15.800> for
