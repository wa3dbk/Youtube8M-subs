said if we do that the goals above us
will<00:03:10.310> happen<00:03:10.670> and<00:03:10.880> we'll<00:03:11.060> keep<00:03:11.239> moving<00:03:11.450> up<00:03:11.690> the

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
will happen and we'll keep moving up the

we focus on the process and not the

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.490 
we focus on the process and not the
results<00:03:17.269> good<00:03:17.660> things<00:03:17.870> will<00:03:18.019> happen<00:03:18.170> for<00:03:18.440> us
