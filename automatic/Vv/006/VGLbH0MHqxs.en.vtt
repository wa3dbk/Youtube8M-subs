00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.540
 of the preparation 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.500

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.299

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.950
 ten minutes later you're going to do what 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.899
 same with the rest of the mass of the 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.180
 mixture of pionono and you will be like 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:20.000

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.700
 all right 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.560
 here we have three disks of pionono is of 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.070

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.130
 Classic milk sweet from Valcárcel 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.860
 may be missing can not miss extension 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.320
 strangled can not miss the sweet the 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.500
 dulce de leche with bitter cocoa for 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.390
 up do not put sea water if not not for 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.549
 because if it's not an atomic bomb, it's not 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.009
 you can not explode and this what 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.009
 lack of dessert we hear you die and 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.140
 not here and bitter cocoa do not put cocoa 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.110
 sweet not valid because the classic 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.679
 dessert is just that mixture of cocoa 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.539
 bitter with the sweetness of the sweetness of what 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:02.610
 it was there that we do at this point 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:04.799
 for line that is what goes around the 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.530
 candy dessert that is made with sugar 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.110
 pure almonds toast you mix it 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.520
 In his house he revolves talk with the husband 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.290
 take mate 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.950
 and then when this was mixed well what 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.900
 puts on the atomic counter totally in 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.400
 the counter with a little oil other 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.670
 is to tell you how you can buy the 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.080
 praliné made and the pionono so do not you 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.010
 worry I teach you so what 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.840
 learn the praline is left if you see it or what 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.730
 you're going to chop with the knife and if not with 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.190
 a processor to turn on this 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.650
 that is here this was understood 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.930
 sold in the pastry house I do not go to 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.430
 filling that is very fast wants more 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.430
 whipped to half a liter with four 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.280
 Scoops of chestnut impalpable sugar 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.990
 which are the chestnuts and if anyone went to 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.600
 Port of fruits once in the tiger 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.070
 he found the bag of chestnuts and 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.900
 he stayed with the chestnuts you put 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.730
 boiled in syrup it becomes this 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.830
 and if the chestnuts are not sold in 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.750
 syrup the other option if you do not have 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.420
 chestnuts you do not get patatitas in 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.730
 syrup are available everywhere and 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.100
 They have a similar taste that I'm going to 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.930
 tell the secret exactly cost the 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.080
 Half the dessert chestnuts 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.530
 original 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.530
 no no no 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:24.290
 I live in Palermo with that problem 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:26.120
 then chestnuts in syrup meringue 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.790
 broken all this you can buy it in 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.250
 any cotillion pastry house 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.530
 do not pass water do not worry then 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.730
 what we do and how to make this dessert 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.490

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:40.070
 speaking we are on our disk 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.750
 pionono chestnuts cream that you will beat 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.750
 almost to chantilly because what happens when 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.780
 you put the meringue and the chestnut 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.130
 this keeps beating and if it does not go away 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.440
 to pass points is going to contradict you 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.959

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.090

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.830

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.140
 nervous in your house is that this seems 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.440

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.980
 around the cream girl 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.930
 but it happens that it does not have for the last 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.510
 what you have to do is put sugar 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.090
 impalpable above that God help us 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.470

 every side saying that I do not know how to cook 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.390
