00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
think check will retain his number one

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.359 
think check will retain his number one
position<00:00:29.850> in<00:00:30.330> go<00:00:30.600> for<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.650> first<00:00:31.890> centre-back

to<00:00:35.489> be<00:00:35.670> in<00:00:35.910> most<00:00:36.629> of<00:00:36.809> every<00:00:37.170> single<00:00:37.410> game<00:00:37.769> for

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
to be in most of every single game for

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.009 
to be in most of every single game for
Chelsea<00:00:38.879> for<00:00:39.059> next<00:00:39.269> season<00:00:39.510> because<00:00:39.629> he<00:00:39.870> is

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:40.019 
Chelsea for next season because he is

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.259 
opinion i think it's a solid squad the
defense<00:02:44.579> is<00:02:44.849> not<00:02:45.299> the<00:02:45.599> best<00:02:45.750> but<00:02:46.459> for<00:02:47.459> how<00:02:47.670> how

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
defense is not the best but for how how
