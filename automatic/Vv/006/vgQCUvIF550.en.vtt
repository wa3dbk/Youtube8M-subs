alright now we're going to be playing

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.849 
alright now we're going to be playing
around<00:00:03.629> with<00:00:03.840> this<00:00:04.049> alpha<00:00:06.470> okay<00:00:07.470> there's<00:00:07.680> a

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
around with this alpha okay there's a

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.049 
around with this alpha okay there's a
couple<00:00:08.010> different<00:00:08.220> ways<00:00:08.460> we<00:00:08.639> could<00:00:08.730> do<00:00:08.849> this

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
couple different ways we could do this

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.390 
couple different ways we could do this
here's<00:00:09.840> way<00:00:10.110> 1<00:00:10.469> way<00:00:11.240> 1<00:00:12.889> consists<00:00:13.889> of<00:00:14.040> a<00:00:14.160> poly

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
here's way 1 way 1 consists of a poly

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.349 
here's way 1 way 1 consists of a poly
plane<00:00:19.220> going<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.340> take<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.609> plane<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.150> I'm

and drag the hair over to it hit six on
the<00:00:55.590> keyboard<00:01:02.629> let's<00:01:03.629> rotate<00:01:03.930> this<00:01:05.810> I'll

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
the keyboard let's rotate this I'll

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.080 
the keyboard let's rotate this I'll
rotate<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.409> 90<00:01:07.680> degrees<00:01:10.280> now<00:01:11.280> depending<00:01:11.850> how

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090

you<00:01:12.420> want<00:01:12.600> your<00:01:13.049> hair<00:01:13.170> let's<00:01:14.040> say<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:14.280> wanted<00:01:14.640> a

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
you want your hair let's say I wanted a

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.429 
you want your hair let's say I wanted a
whole<00:01:14.939> bunch<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.240> short<00:01:15.479> hair<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:15.990> could<00:01:16.320> do

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
whole bunch of short hair I could do

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.350 
whole bunch of short hair I could do
that<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.890> just<00:01:17.549> keep<00:01:17.869> using<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.170> same<00:01:19.409> swatch

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
that I just keep using the same swatch

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.260 
that I just keep using the same swatch
I'm<00:01:21.360> going<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.540> be<00:01:21.659> using<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:22.080> long<00:01:22.350> river<00:01:22.560> right

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
I'm going to be using a long river right

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.060 
I'm going to be using a long river right
variation<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.420> hair<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:25.080> you'll<00:01:25.710> be<00:01:25.830> going

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
variation of hair so you'll be going

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.120 
variation of hair so you'll be going
like<00:01:26.220> this<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:27.740> I'm<00:01:28.740> going<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:28.920> be<00:01:29.009> using

like this and I'm going to be using

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.789 
like this and I'm going to be using
ncloth<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.720> shape<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.380> hair<00:01:33.170> so<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.500> needs

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
ncloth to shape the hair so it needs

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:41.120 
ncloth to shape the hair so it needs
some<00:01:35.009> edge<00:01:35.970> looped<00:01:38.990> ok<00:01:39.990> let's<00:01:40.470> go<00:01:40.710> into

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
some edge looped ok let's go into

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.370 
some edge looped ok let's go into
polygons<00:01:43.130> let's<00:01:44.130> go<00:01:44.310> into<00:01:44.729> edit<00:01:44.970> mesh<00:01:45.380> insert

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
polygons let's go into edit mesh insert

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.249 
polygons let's go into edit mesh insert
edge<00:01:46.560> loop<00:01:47.360> square<00:01:48.360> box<00:01:49.549> i'll<00:01:50.549> be<00:01:50.790> using

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
edge loop square box i'll be using

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.440 
edge loop square box i'll be using
multiple<00:01:52.259> edge<00:01:52.439> loops<00:01:53.180> i'm<00:01:54.180> going<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.360> be

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
multiple edge loops i'm going to be

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.639 
multiple edge loops i'm going to be
using<00:01:54.479> 10<00:01:56.270> then<00:01:57.270> I'll<00:01:57.420> reset<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.990> tool<00:01:59.299> and

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
using 10 then I'll reset the tool and

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.680 
using 10 then I'll reset the tool and
then<00:02:01.649> I'm<00:02:01.770> going<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:01.979> go<00:02:02.130> like<00:02:02.399> this

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.559 

now<00:02:06.690> I<00:02:06.720> can<00:02:06.960> always<00:02:07.140> remove<00:02:07.770> this<00:02:08.670> one<00:02:08.970> later

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
now I can always remove this one later

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:25.160 
now I can always remove this one later
on<00:02:15.170> okay<00:02:16.400> duplicate<00:02:17.400> this

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.080 

this<00:02:25.709> one<00:02:25.890> I'm<00:02:25.980> going<00:02:26.099> to<00:02:26.190> sink<00:02:26.520> down<00:02:26.700> into<00:02:26.910> the

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
this one I'm going to sink down into the

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.030 
this one I'm going to sink down into the
hair<00:02:27.270> or<00:02:27.810> head<00:02:28.110> a<00:02:28.319> little<00:02:28.620> bit<00:02:30.890> then<00:02:31.890> we're

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
hair or head a little bit then we're

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.440 
hair or head a little bit then we're
going<00:02:32.130> to<00:02:32.220> go<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:32.370> n<00:02:32.730> cloth<00:02:33.950> and<00:02:35.150> turn<00:02:36.150> it<00:02:36.330> into

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
going to go to n cloth and turn it into

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.590 
going to go to n cloth and turn it into
a<00:02:36.599> cloth<00:02:36.930> object<00:02:40.790> then<00:02:41.790> I<00:02:42.060> needed<00:02:42.420> to

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
a cloth object then I needed to

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.750 
a cloth object then I needed to
constrain<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.410> something<00:02:43.800> because<00:02:44.100> if<00:02:44.400> I<00:02:44.580> just

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
constrain to something because if I just

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.490 
constrain to something because if I just
hit<00:02:44.940> play<00:02:45.120> right<00:02:45.360> now<00:02:45.390> it<00:02:45.720> would<00:02:45.900> fall<00:02:46.200> to<00:02:46.230> the

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
hit play right now it would fall to the

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.320 
hit play right now it would fall to the
floor<00:02:46.880> so<00:02:48.350> grab<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:49.709> three<00:02:50.250> verte<00:02:50.520> for<00:02:51.120> to<00:02:51.180> see

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
floor so grab the three verte for to see

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.690 
floor so grab the three verte for to see
here<00:02:51.600> or<00:02:51.780> four<00:02:52.709> vertices<00:02:53.069> doesn't<00:02:53.580> really

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
here or four vertices doesn't really

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.479 
here or four vertices doesn't really
matter<00:02:55.580> and<00:02:56.580> go<00:02:57.330> to<00:02:57.560> create<00:02:58.560> a<00:02:58.709> transform

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
matter and go to create a transform

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:05.180 
matter and go to create a transform
constraint<00:03:02.299> okay<00:03:03.299> now<00:03:04.260> if<00:03:04.410> I<00:03:04.500> add<00:03:04.650> some<00:03:04.860> frames

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
constraint okay now if I add some frames

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.650 
constraint okay now if I add some frames
let's<00:03:05.640> say<00:03:05.819> add<00:03:06.120> five<00:03:07.110> thousand<00:03:07.799> frames<00:03:08.480> yes<00:03:09.480> I

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
let's say add five thousand frames yes I

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.259 
let's say add five thousand frames yes I
don't<00:03:09.840> mess<00:03:10.019> around<00:03:10.170> with<00:03:10.500> frames<00:03:10.940> hit<00:03:11.940> play

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
don't mess around with frames hit play

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.680 
don't mess around with frames hit play
you'll<00:03:12.660> see<00:03:12.900> that<00:03:13.049> it<00:03:13.200> falls<00:03:14.239> but<00:03:15.239> it<00:03:15.480> falls

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
you'll see that it falls but it falls

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.890 
you'll see that it falls but it falls
through<00:03:15.989> the<00:03:16.110> head<00:03:18.170> so<00:03:19.170> we<00:03:19.980> need<00:03:20.190> something

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
through the head so we need something

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.400 
through the head so we need something
we're<00:03:21.900> just<00:03:21.930> going<00:03:22.350> to<00:03:22.410> make<00:03:23.100> a<00:03:23.130> sphere<00:03:23.730> I

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
we're just going to make a sphere I

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.199 
we're just going to make a sphere I
don't<00:03:25.410> like<00:03:25.470> using<00:03:25.799> any<00:03:26.220> of<00:03:26.519> the<00:03:26.730> head<00:03:26.940> itself

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
don't like using any of the head itself

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.050 
don't like using any of the head itself
I<00:03:27.780> like<00:03:28.019> using<00:03:28.260> a<00:03:28.790> different<00:03:29.790> piece<00:03:29.910> of

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
I like using a different piece of

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.849 
I like using a different piece of
geometry<00:03:30.239> to<00:03:30.750> do<00:03:30.870> this<00:03:31.049> that<00:03:31.320> I<00:03:31.350> can<00:03:31.560> get<00:03:31.709> rid

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
geometry to do this that I can get rid

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:39.740 
geometry to do this that I can get rid
of<00:03:31.920> later<00:03:36.440> i'll<00:03:37.440> try<00:03:37.799> to<00:03:37.859> closely<00:03:38.220> match<00:03:38.750> this

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
of later i'll try to closely match this

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:52.530 
of later i'll try to closely match this
to<00:03:40.049> the<00:03:40.170> shape<00:03:40.380> of<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.620> head

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.330 

again<00:03:53.290> we're<00:03:53.469> going<00:03:53.560> to<00:03:53.650> be<00:03:53.769> getting<00:03:53.920> rid<00:03:54.310> of

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
again we're going to be getting rid of

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.860 
again we're going to be getting rid of
it<00:03:54.549> later<00:03:54.849> so<00:03:55.209> it<00:03:55.299> doesn't<00:03:55.540> really<00:03:55.629> matter

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
it later so it doesn't really matter

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.619 
it later so it doesn't really matter
that<00:03:56.730> she<00:03:57.730> has<00:03:57.819> an<00:03:58.000> egg<00:03:58.150> on<00:03:58.299> your<00:03:58.359> head<00:03:58.510> now

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:00.629 
that she has an egg on your head now

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:03.420 
that she has an egg on your head now
okay<00:04:01.629> it<00:04:01.689> still<00:04:01.989> falls<00:04:02.200> through<00:04:02.500> what<00:04:03.219> we<00:04:03.310> do

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
okay it still falls through what we do

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.890 
okay it still falls through what we do
is<00:04:03.579> grab<00:04:04.209> it<00:04:04.950> go<00:04:05.950> to<00:04:06.010> ncloth<00:04:06.519> and<00:04:06.849> click<00:04:07.540> this

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
is grab it go to ncloth and click this

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:17.099 
is grab it go to ncloth and click this
button<00:04:08.140> and<00:04:10.319> they<00:04:11.319> play<00:04:13.950> perfect<00:04:16.079> now<00:04:17.079> let's

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
button and they play perfect now let's

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:27.300 
button and they play perfect now let's
move<00:04:17.530> that<00:04:17.769> over<00:04:17.949> just<00:04:18.370> a<00:04:18.459> little<00:04:18.489> bit<00:04:26.220> until<00:04:27.220> I

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
move that over just a little bit until I

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:34.610 
move that over just a little bit until I
see<00:04:27.550> some<00:04:27.580> back<00:04:28.270> face<00:04:28.599> culling<00:04:28.919> occur<00:04:32.370> there

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
see some back face culling occur there

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.950 
see some back face culling occur there
good<00:04:38.789> now<00:04:39.789> that's<00:04:40.150> going<00:04:40.360> to<00:04:40.419> be<00:04:40.479> your<00:04:40.630> mission

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
good now that's going to be your mission

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.129 
good now that's going to be your mission
for<00:04:41.229> quite<00:04:41.440> some<00:04:41.650> time<00:04:41.680> is<00:04:42.220> to<00:04:42.370> do<00:04:42.520> this<00:04:43.139> shift

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
for quite some time is to do this shift

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:54.350 
for quite some time is to do this shift
D<00:04:44.620> duplicate<00:04:45.430> move<00:04:45.990> and<00:04:46.990> cloth<00:04:51.060> vertices

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:02.620 

constraint<00:04:55.410> play

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.390 

and<00:05:02.930> you<00:05:03.320> keep<00:05:03.470> doing<00:05:03.770> that<00:05:03.860> over<00:05:04.040> and<00:05:04.250> over

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
and you keep doing that over and over

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.120 
and you keep doing that over and over
until<00:05:04.640> you<00:05:04.880> get<00:05:05.120> enough<00:05:05.330> hair<00:05:05.810> and<00:05:06.020> then<00:05:06.950> what

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
until you get enough hair and then what

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:14.200 
until you get enough hair and then what
you<00:05:07.220> could<00:05:07.370> do<00:05:07.550> is<00:05:07.790> just<00:05:08.450> get<00:05:08.750> rid<00:05:09.050> of<00:05:09.080> this<00:05:13.210> now

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
you could do is just get rid of this now

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.880 
you could do is just get rid of this now
we'll<00:05:14.390> get<00:05:14.540> into<00:05:14.720> that<00:05:14.870> part<00:05:15.290> here<00:05:15.740> in<00:05:15.830> a

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:15.890 
we'll get into that part here in a

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.410 
we'll get into that part here in a
little<00:05:16.040> bit<00:05:16.220> but<00:05:16.430> what<00:05:16.610> I<00:05:16.640> want<00:05:16.850> to<00:05:17.000> do<00:05:17.090> is<00:05:17.120> now

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:17.420 
little bit but what I want to do is now

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.140 
little bit but what I want to do is now
show<00:05:17.690> you<00:05:17.750> the<00:05:18.080> second<00:05:19.040> variety<00:05:19.220> of<00:05:19.670> hair<00:05:20.120> that

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
show you the second variety of hair that

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.560 
show you the second variety of hair that
you<00:05:20.360> can<00:05:20.630> make<00:05:20.950> with<00:05:21.950> this<00:05:22.160> stuff<00:05:22.460> in<00:05:22.790> the<00:05:23.420> next

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
you can make with this stuff in the next

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.780 
you can make with this stuff in the next
