00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.880
 you have to check how much we are really going 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.619
 to leave available for us 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.800
 applications games among other things 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.780
 and the internal memory connection wifi serves 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.850
 as a hotspot that yes as a modem 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.010

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:46.960
 good 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.390
 in the moment of truth we are going to 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.520
 proceed 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.050
 uncover it so we can see everything 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.990
 that is going to include this little 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.410
 device 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:00.240

 true this is comfortable for size 4 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:23.250
 inches the truth is that in my hand 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.070
 pretty good and I'm very bad then 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.980
 it is very very comfortable the truth is that this 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.750
 is focused or we would recommend it a lot 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.870
 for those who seek it small 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.460
 unobtrusive not too much hindrance in good 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.400
 now let's understand first of all 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.950

 very important with the 512 ram is not 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.650
 bad of course it takes very much to heart what 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.900
 better it can be wrong to what the ram is 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:58.670
 but the mica is not good or good as 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:02.500
 EPS never touch blue very well 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:07.150
 what are your USB cable going to do 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.150
 small pacifier headphones 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.620
 the battery will show nothing 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:18.170
 quickly how much will be the 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:22.700
 capacity this is 1300 milliamps 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:25.400
 perfect your charger header 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.800
 very pretty and its cover as always 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.940
 is the one that give thousands of silicone dating 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.940
 and manuals 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.710
 ok already prepared our device 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.270
 let's proceed to turn it on to give 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.990
 the first views of that new 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.120
 telefonito 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.220
 the presentation of his personal friend the 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.200
 presentation of your liking very much what 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.590
 is the video type they present in the 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.590
 beginning 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.909
 so I'm seeing the buttons on 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.040
 here it does not turn on you have to have that 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:00.530
 good point but let's finish 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.420
 set it up and see if you really understand 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.519
 or does not turn on and based on that already 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.519
 we will see if it comes on or not 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.860
 how can this be a call 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.330
 emergency and we could see we started to 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.640
 skip 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:22.560
 Skip omit anyway 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.160
 here in the normal configuration 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.160
 there is 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:35.250
 and here is our presentation of 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.250
 the zoom 40 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.200
 pretty good 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.330
 well here something that pleases us is that 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.950
 then they are not getting fast what 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.900
 are the adjustments then we are going to 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.390
 take advantage of that let's go to information 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.840
 of the phone to see what android has 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.599
 4 points 4.2 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:56.140
 and the proof that the android is 4.4 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:58.840
 Kitkat point 2 spoke very good version 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.360
 android nothing nothing that we can not 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.420
 thank storage let's see 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.549
 how much do they leave us ok storage 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.980
 internally they will leave us available for 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:12.290
 applications music games among others 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.569
 little things 1.12 gigabytes 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.890
 you have to have that important data in 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.039
 applications and games we will not have 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.870
 a lot but it's very good I say dial 4 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:23.979
 gigas then for applications and others 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.979
 One giga is super good 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.410
 and there it is 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.520
 we'll see 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:34.790
 the menu an interface itself had not 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.200
 seen these icons more than here with 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.300
 consumption something similar to the best in 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.130
 Nokia interface in a icons 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.590
 little bit round pretty friendly this 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.990
 it is very beautiful the android are very 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.330
 clean have no publicity of any 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.910
 brand company now I know it 's 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.900
 pretty good document on facebook what 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.610
 classic you have to update it 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.290
 equal browser with the pastor who already 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.080
 it will depend on us that what 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:03.310
 we want to download and now the moment of 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:07.680
 the truth the camera 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.680
 of 3.2 megapixels what it looks like 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.680
 with dark ones and it takes a little 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:27.300
 does not have plastic because the camera if something 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:30.870
 low but good are 3.2 megapixels 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:33.890
 neither do you have to be very demanding 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.890
 in that question 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.610
 then in a well-lit environment 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.210
 the truth is going to look good what is going to 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.850
 be the 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.680
 the camera and maybe for something 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:47.780
 simple and basic this team is super 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.820
 well the camera is beautiful is not so bad 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.480
 cap also the movements must see 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:55.130
 that in dark and it takes a little bit but 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:58.280
 the truth to make 3.2 megapixels 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:06:02.409
 with flash is super good I do not see why 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:04.119
 you have to put yourself in that heavy issue 

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:06.129
 but hey it's a practical time 

00:06:04.119 --> 00:06:07.869
 simple personally what 

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:09.819
 We would recommend for those who are looking for 

00:06:07.869 --> 00:06:11.769
 something simple and simple with networks 

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:14.559
 social wifi mp3 player radio fm 

00:06:11.769 --> 00:06:16.989
 bluetooth all that kind of issues the 

00:06:14.559 --> 00:06:18.790
 gallery by the camera the little screen 

00:06:16.989 --> 00:06:21.850
 see very well 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:24.449
 and the colors do not just work 

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:26.669
 fluid we can see it here 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:28.320
 what data does not turn on these 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:29.850
 then there 

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.249
 you have to have a little bit and I can with 

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:35.399
 it but in short 

00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:37.559
 the truth that the team see it nice 

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:40.409
 and he comes I do not give him any thatcher 

00:06:37.559 --> 00:06:43.019
 contrary practical for what it is 

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:45.089
 this team or for those who 

00:06:43.019 --> 00:06:46.829
 they look for practical and direct in short 

00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:48.599
 hoping that the video has been your 

00:06:46.829 --> 00:06:49.979
 I'm glad you did not forget to share it 

00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:52.349
 which is the only thing we ask in the channel 

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:54.329
 and we'll see you in the next video of 

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:57.289
 technology until then greetings friend and 

00:06:54.329 --> 00:06:57.289
