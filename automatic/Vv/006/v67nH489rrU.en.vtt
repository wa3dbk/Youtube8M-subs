well<00:01:20.610> I'm<00:01:20.759> realistically<00:01:21.360> like<00:01:21.540> maybe<00:01:21.750> we

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
well I'm realistically like maybe we

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.050 
well I'm realistically like maybe we
could<00:01:22.020> go<00:01:22.140> for<00:01:22.409> like<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.830> don't<00:01:23.220> know<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.700> say<00:01:23.970> we

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
could go for like I don't know I say we

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.280 
could go for like I don't know I say we
have<00:01:24.180> eight<00:01:24.330> minutes<00:01:24.450> left<00:01:24.750> can<00:01:24.930> we<00:01:24.990> had<00:01:25.110> two

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
have eight minutes left can we had two

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.530 
have eight minutes left can we had two
hours<00:01:25.680> right<00:01:26.070> something<00:01:26.549> like<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:26.880> so<00:01:27.330> here

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
hours right something like that so here

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.149 
hours right something like that so here
we<00:01:27.570> actually<00:01:28.080> have<00:01:28.290> android<00:01:28.799> running<00:01:28.920> on<00:01:29.130> a

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
we actually have android running on a

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.499 
we actually have android running on a
Mac<00:01:30.229> so<00:01:31.229> in<00:01:31.770> this<00:01:32.189> instance<00:01:32.250> we<00:01:33.119> can<00:01:33.270> use<00:01:33.390> the

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
Mac so in this instance we can use the

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.929 
Mac so in this instance we can use the
track<00:01:33.720> pad<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:34.079> navigate<00:01:34.110> around<00:01:34.790> so<00:01:35.790> we<00:01:35.909> can

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
track pad to navigate around so we can

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.690 
track pad to navigate around so we can
go<00:01:36.180> into<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.450> gallery<00:01:40.070> choose<00:01:41.070> look<00:01:41.400> at<00:01:41.520> some

windows photos it's got nothing to do
any<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:48.960> these<00:01:49.049> systems<00:01:49.259> but<00:01:49.950> if<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.130> look<00:01:50.220> at

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
any of these systems but if you look at

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.560 
any of these systems but if you look at
the<00:01:50.369> trackpad<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:51.000> can<00:01:51.119> actually<00:01:51.240> just

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
the trackpad you can actually just

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.639 
the trackpad you can actually just
gestures<00:01:52.020> gesture<00:01:52.920> through<00:01:53.250> like<00:01:54.210> on<00:01:55.110> android

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
gestures gesture through like on android

fun and then if we want to all we have
to<00:02:18.209> do<00:02:18.359> is<00:02:18.689> look<00:02:19.049> to<00:02:19.109> the<00:02:19.319> side<00:02:19.500> here<00:02:19.859> and

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
to do is look to the side here and

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.179 
to do is look to the side here and
they've<00:02:20.879> actually<00:02:21.140> modified<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.379> they<00:02:22.920> taking

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:23.189 
they've actually modified it they taking

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:25.759 
they've actually modified it they taking

out the optical drive and put in some
magical<00:02:26.159> hardware<00:02:27.469> and<00:02:28.469> then<00:02:28.650> all<00:02:28.859> we<00:02:28.920> have<00:02:28.950> to

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
magical hardware and then all we have to

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.890 
magical hardware and then all we have to
do<00:02:29.189> is<00:02:29.219> hit<00:02:29.579> the<00:02:29.879> switch<00:02:30.209> inside<00:02:30.719> this

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900

hunter and then if we just flip the

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:01.159 
hunter and then if we just flip the
switch<00:02:59.790> on<00:02:59.909> the<00:02:59.969> side<00:03:00.180> that<00:03:00.419> they<00:03:00.719> put<00:03:00.930> inside

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:01.169 
switch on the side that they put inside

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:03.020 
switch on the side that they put inside
the<00:03:01.260> Kensington<00:03:01.680> lock<00:03:01.799> you<00:03:02.459> can<00:03:02.609> see<00:03:02.730> that<00:03:02.760> add

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
the Kensington lock you can see that add

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.759 
the Kensington lock you can see that add
the<00:03:03.239> apple<00:03:03.599> applications<00:03:04.290> are<00:03:04.409> still<00:03:04.620> running

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
the apple applications are still running

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.490 
the apple applications are still running
so<00:03:05.400> it's<00:03:06.060> actually<00:03:06.209> running<00:03:06.629> both<00:03:06.870> both

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
so it's actually running both both

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.770 
so it's actually running both both
operating<00:03:07.859> system<00:03:08.129> at<00:03:08.969> the<00:03:09.090> same<00:03:09.239> time<00:03:09.419> off<00:03:09.629> of

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
operating system at the same time off of

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.899 
operating system at the same time off of
both<00:03:09.989> motherboards<00:03:10.680> that<00:03:11.340> are<00:03:11.430> built<00:03:11.579> inside

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909 
both motherboards that are built inside

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:13.309 
both motherboards that are built inside
so<00:03:12.060> if<00:03:12.150> you<00:03:12.239> want<00:03:12.419> the<00:03:12.510> power<00:03:12.689> save<00:03:12.989> here<00:03:13.199> and
