00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:11.620
 rudolf and pancho melo 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:14.969
 we are indicated to demand the 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.250
 compliance with law 20.243 that the law 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.020
 it protects us as actors 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.140
 on the patrimonial and moral issue that 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.850
 we have about our creations and that 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.970
 what they start to respect the law that 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.070
 something super easy 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.169
 we want to reach an agreement 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:36.150
 for projects very quickly it's not 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:39.550
 only silver but also themes 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.380
 moral rights are as artists 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.600
 that we like our work to me 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.150
 like to do it 80 for example and in this 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.100
 minute I have to stop recording because 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.310
 It is also important to fight for the 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:54.829
 The bank's rights should show is 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:58.290
 compensate him and learn to listen 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:01.739
 but very well they are with more disposition 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.550
 to listen to the actors who are the ones 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.210
 they represent us 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.360
 she has looked very much 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.710
 willingness to flex and so they have 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:18.710
 done and we are waiting for it to be achieved 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:21.560
 listen and right now it's all 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.930
 arrested and that implies for the penal 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.570
 just inside this paralysis 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.070
 a big loss that seems like 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.619
 only part where they squeeze the shoe 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.960
 that's why we are detained and we do not want 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.520
 record neither lived and tomorrow until the 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.300
 arrival of the door to learn to 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:41.290
 listen to games to combÃ©s to learn 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:47.200
 to listen to demonstrate is to converse 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:47.200
 learn to paint to talk 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:58.340
 hear 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.830
 what we are requesting that 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.110
 it was at least 1 percent of the 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.800
 advertising revenues are not the 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.269
 utilities 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:11.300
 the income by trial of all time 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:14.450
 dramatic including the summaries 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.250
 in the dubbing also because here in 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.840
 chile is dubbed in the animated 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.350
 all that is contemplated in the agreement 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.090
 and they have accepted it and also what it is in 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.470
 the choreographic work the dancers 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.470
 they are also because they are portals 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.310
 today November 7 they have spent together 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.220
 seven months of April 7 that were the 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:39.570
 We have negotiated with the first 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.550
 channels 13 7000 kim jong and they have 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.570
 compromised of what megavision also 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:49.790
 you go to the agreement that we are going to sign 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.790
 it has cost us but we have achieved it
