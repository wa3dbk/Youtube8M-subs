got<00:01:35.600> gelatin<00:01:35.930> in<00:01:36.020> there<00:01:36.170> so<00:01:36.650> we're<00:01:36.770> going<00:01:36.920> to

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
got gelatin in there so we're going to

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.690 
got gelatin in there so we're going to
let<00:01:37.190> the<00:01:37.610> gelatin<00:01:38.090> bloom<00:01:39.130> blooming<00:01:40.130> is<00:01:40.310> when

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
let the gelatin bloom blooming is when

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.310 
let the gelatin bloom blooming is when
the<00:01:40.790> gelatin<00:01:41.180> actually<00:01:41.420> becomes<00:01:41.750> active<00:01:42.200> so

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
the gelatin actually becomes active so

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.900 
the gelatin actually becomes active so
we're<00:01:42.410> going<00:01:42.500> to<00:01:42.590> sprinkle<00:01:42.860> it<00:01:43.100> over<00:01:43.220> the<00:01:43.700> top

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
we're going to sprinkle it over the top

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.910 
we're going to sprinkle it over the top
of<00:01:43.970> our<00:01:44.150> cold<00:01:44.570> liquid<00:01:45.050> this<00:01:45.440> is<00:01:45.590> our<00:01:45.680> heavy

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
of our cold liquid this is our heavy

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.590 
cream I think one packet for about a cup
and<00:01:49.070> a<00:01:49.160> half<00:01:49.190> of<00:01:49.610> liquid<00:01:50.030> and<00:01:50.300> we<00:01:50.360> should<00:01:50.510> be

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
and a half of liquid and we should be

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.850 
and a half of liquid and we should be
solid<00:01:50.810> we're<00:01:50.930> going<00:01:51.050> to<00:01:51.140> let<00:01:51.200> this<00:01:51.350> sit<00:01:51.410> for

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
solid we're going to let this sit for

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.670 
solid we're going to let this sit for
two<00:01:52.310> or<00:01:52.430> three<00:01:52.460> minutes<00:01:52.880> to<00:01:53.090> let<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:53.680> gelatin

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
two or three minutes to let the gelatin

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.990 
two or three minutes to let the gelatin
bloom<00:01:54.950> and<00:01:55.190> kind<00:01:55.340> of<00:01:55.370> absorb<00:01:55.700> some<00:01:55.850> of<00:01:55.880> the

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
bloom and kind of absorb some of the

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.760 
bloom and kind of absorb some of the
liquid<00:01:56.150> and<00:01:56.330> it<00:01:56.480> kind<00:01:56.630> of<00:01:56.690> gets<00:01:57.050> active<00:01:57.560> that's

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
liquid and it kind of gets active that's

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:58.840 
liquid and it kind of gets active that's
how<00:01:57.860> it's<00:01:58.010> going<00:01:58.100> to<00:01:58.160> cling<00:01:58.490> everything

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
how it's going to cling everything

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.410 
how it's going to cling everything
together<00:01:58.970> and<00:01:59.240> bind<00:01:59.600> the<00:01:59.750> dessert<00:02:00.020> together

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
together and bind the dessert together

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.030 
together and bind the dessert together
so<00:02:02.420> let's<00:02:02.480> get<00:02:02.660> back<00:02:02.750> to<00:02:02.870> our<00:02:02.900> milk<00:02:03.260> once<00:02:03.890> this

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
so let's get back to our milk once this

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.710 
so let's get back to our milk once this
is<00:02:04.220> simmered<00:02:04.640> for<00:02:04.820> just<00:02:05.240> a<00:02:05.330> few<00:02:05.540> minutes

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
is simmered for just a few minutes

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.600 
is simmered for just a few minutes
you'll<00:02:05.930> notice<00:02:06.230> the<00:02:06.380> color<00:02:06.710> starts<00:02:07.400> to

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
you'll notice the color starts to

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.969 
you'll notice the color starts to
slightly<00:02:07.970> change<00:02:08.500> so<00:02:09.500> you're<00:02:09.619> starting<00:02:09.739> to

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
slightly change so you're starting to

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.130 
slightly change so you're starting to
get<00:02:10.129> a<00:02:10.190> bit<00:02:10.429> of<00:02:10.610> a<00:02:11.120> darker<00:02:11.540> color<00:02:11.750> almost<00:02:11.930> the

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
get a bit of a darker color almost the

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.809 
get a bit of a darker color almost the
color<00:02:12.290> of<00:02:12.440> the<00:02:12.739> cereal<00:02:13.069> that<00:02:13.099> means<00:02:13.340> all<00:02:13.610> the

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
color of the cereal that means all the

color of the cereal that means all the
flavor<00:02:14.180> is<00:02:14.480> releasing<00:02:15.410> from<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:15.650> flakes<00:02:15.950> into

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
flavor is releasing from the flakes into

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.339 
flavor is releasing from the flakes into
the<00:02:16.879> liquid<00:02:17.060> if<00:02:17.390> you<00:02:17.480> want<00:02:17.750> to<00:02:17.930> you<00:02:18.080> can<00:02:18.200> add<00:02:18.290> a
