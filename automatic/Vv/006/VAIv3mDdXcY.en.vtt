on<00:01:12.090> Cliffjumper<00:01:12.810> we're<00:01:12.990> on<00:01:13.200> bumblebee<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:14.010> is

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
on Cliffjumper we're on bumblebee it is

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:24.920 
on Cliffjumper we're on bumblebee it is
red<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:18.350> I<00:01:19.909> like<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:22.790> they<00:01:23.790> do<00:01:23.850> have<00:01:24.360> similar

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
red so I like that they do have similar

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.510 
red so I like that they do have similar
they<00:01:25.080> have<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.409> exact<00:01:25.860> same<00:01:26.130> transformation

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
they have the exact same transformation

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.990 
they have the exact same transformation
so<00:01:27.060> if<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.450> have<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.900> bumblebee<00:01:28.759> it's<00:01:29.759> pretty

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
so if you have the bumblebee it's pretty

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.510 
so if you have the bumblebee it's pretty
much<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.150> same<00:01:31.040> boats<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.189> but<00:01:32.340> will<00:01:32.430> be

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
much the same boats that but will be

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.460 
much the same boats that but will be
