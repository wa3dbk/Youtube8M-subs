the<00:00:34.720> cutscenes<00:00:35.170> sometimes<00:00:35.970> you<00:00:36.970> also<00:00:37.120> want<00:00:37.300> to

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:37.330 
the cutscenes sometimes you also want to

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:38.700 
the cutscenes sometimes you also want to
make<00:00:37.480> sure<00:00:37.510> that<00:00:37.839> all<00:00:37.960> the<00:00:38.050> skulls<00:00:38.320> are<00:00:38.500> turned

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
make sure that all the skulls are turned

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.939 
make sure that all the skulls are turned
off<00:00:38.860> before<00:00:39.430> you<00:00:39.699> start<00:00:39.940> it<00:00:40.030> because<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:41.710> might

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:41.949 
off before you start it because it might

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:43.680 
off before you start it because it might
cause<00:00:42.159> the<00:00:42.430> game<00:00:42.670> to<00:00:42.850> crash<00:00:42.879> while<00:00:43.479> loading

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690

the<00:00:43.960> the<00:00:44.890> glitched<00:00:45.190> cutscene<00:00:45.699> I<00:00:45.729> guess<00:00:46.830> so

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:47.830 
the the glitched cutscene I guess so

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.170

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
when a new remastered graphics you will

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.149 
when a new remastered graphics you will
notice<00:01:25.750> that<00:01:25.900> it's<00:01:26.440> pretty<00:01:26.650> bleached<00:01:26.950> out

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
notice that it's pretty bleached out

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:28.980 
notice that it's pretty bleached out
because<00:01:27.970> it<00:01:28.090> wasn't<00:01:28.330> really<00:01:28.510> meant<00:01:28.630> for<00:01:28.870> this

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
because it wasn't really meant for this

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.050 
because it wasn't really meant for this
a<00:01:29.050> lot<00:01:29.320> of<00:01:29.350> things<00:01:29.530> are<00:01:29.710> missing<00:01:29.860> but<00:01:30.730> you<00:01:30.909> can

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
a lot of things are missing but you can

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.580 
a lot of things are missing but you can
still<00:01:31.300> switch<00:01:31.540> between<00:01:31.720> the<00:01:31.930> old<00:01:32.110> and<00:01:32.320> the<00:01:32.409> new

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
still switch between the old and the new

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.890 
still switch between the old and the new
graphics<00:01:33.100> while<00:01:33.460> watching<00:01:34.120> this<00:01:36.210> but<00:01:37.210> yeah<00:01:37.390> as

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
graphics while watching this but yeah as

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.450 
graphics while watching this but yeah as
you<00:01:38.380> can<00:01:38.409> see<00:01:38.620> like<00:01:38.830> it<00:01:38.860> wasn't<00:01:39.070> meant<00:01:39.370> for

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
you can see like it wasn't meant for

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.130 
you can see like it wasn't meant for
this<00:01:39.760> but<00:01:40.000> it<00:01:40.120> still<00:01:40.360> looks<00:01:40.510> pretty<00:01:40.570> nice<00:01:40.930> this

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
this but it still looks pretty nice this

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.430 
this but it still looks pretty nice this
way<00:01:41.350> and<00:01:41.620> I<00:01:42.120> think<00:01:43.120> it<00:01:43.180> looks<00:01:43.300> pretty<00:01:44.110> cool

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.740 

but<00:01:47.440> yeah<00:01:47.620> so<00:01:48.310> after<00:01:48.670> this<00:01:48.820> I<00:01:49.060> will<00:01:49.270> show<00:01:49.690> you
