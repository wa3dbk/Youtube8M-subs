00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.689
 of opinion so I'm based on the republic 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.730
 of gamer 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:32.160

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.809

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.640
 time so here it is for the dog 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.629

00:00:50.900 --> 00:01:05.380
 Calvin Borel time late and your bullshit 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.530
 gold so the 22 on the back of this pc 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:17.820
 special so the notice what is it 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:20.789
 we have others in the record and that 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.049
 here is the lens that's for sure 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:26.700
 it's the guarantee 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:30.689
 that's it aside so here's a little bit of 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.060
 monster so this is to store your 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.789
 cables so frankly his suffering to 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.450
 she planned China believes that a quarter of 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:38.450
 it's in melee 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.079
 so then no it's then cable 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.530
 braided 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:51.409
 of course I did not hang so 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.670
 it's good we can shoot 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.500
 now i want in the post is 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:02.959
 attached to 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:02.959
 here we were trying to kidnap me up 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:16.580
 here are promoted troops with scissors 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:38.190
 like that voila here is passing to the helmet 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.110
 therefore first jack prices that go 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.110
 remote control because the remote control this 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.400
 it's the pro so it's not the most 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:50.120
 normal so that's the pro so he does 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:54.120
 from 7.1 there is the fps holland mode and mp3 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.740
 it's so simple this poster 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.820
 did not want to connect directly to the 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.340
 remote control that's in there 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.440
 so I invite them to the time you see 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.840
 well the braided cable 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:07.370
 here is a little trick there to hang it 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:11.820
 so not his helmet 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:14.370
 it is very very but really be 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:17.430
 comfortable the microphone cayla so to my 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:21.420
 notice we pulled that to attract for the 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:25.260
 go out and after for back to school not see 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.810
 of difficulties for that so after a 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.739
 of these specials but it's true that the 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.030
 dedication that goes well here is leather 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:37.630
 on the sides it's not fake 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:41.420
 curiously real leather so very good 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:59.450
 so here we go and then we move on 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:04:01.550
 as stake remove it zero voices before 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.790
 that the remote control I pass we see 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.840
 well well so we see so asus 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.160
 here you support to change the 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.100
 modes the two girls I connect you 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.620
 there and all that in very cssa is known 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:18.019
 exactly in usb we go I see that 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:20.090
 the well- protected usb and it 's non cdu 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:23.050
 I thought it would be gold plated 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:26.510
 but no it can be gold plated 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.250
 so here is really a very beautiful 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.270
 product I will do the tests to see if 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.130
 really up to it 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:35.419
 so here we did not show you the 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:37.100
 pro gaming headset so here I am 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:38.720
 would like the next one for a video 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:43.510
 of a boxing on fans and then 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.510
 then a video on battlefield 3
