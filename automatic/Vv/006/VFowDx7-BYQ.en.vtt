00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:17.030
 has for some brotherly I want 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.030
 are also used to that is 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:26.560
 it was very easy so both to 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.520
 are getting 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.960
 Of course that makes thanks for ours 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.960
 dare together 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:40.879
 nevertheless we also complain in the environment 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:44.780
 they were both sat the two of us 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:53.300
 even if we can both understand 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:56.210
 In principle we differentiate the field 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.519
 to allow us to do something physically 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.000
 a little stupid ask us as possible 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:06.890
 his 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:09.610
 The character can be a little annoying 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:14.750
 if you then sheared over a comb 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:16.759
 when she does something else again 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.179
 he himself has done that spirit 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:23.899
 because it can be a bit annoying too 

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:28.270
 mastermind that we are at the moment 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:32.539
 For example I think in general our 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.330
 attitude that's right with us 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:37.119
 celebrate 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.259
 otherwise relaxed it is great 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:42.939
 if it is always said we are always in 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.939
 double pack that's right we also master 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.340
 annoying just as exhausting sometimes 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.400
 even increase as normal 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.440
 training week in fine and natural 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.600
 I have three loud we make far 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.260
 all happy and involuntary tenth 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.330
 none of it and therefore be worth 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.369
 and the expense is just for follow 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.660
 for example, now last summer 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:17.770
 the championship finally a reward 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.770
 for the hard work 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:27.170
 basically we have been so far 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.099
 internationally common and ultimately 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.519
 the medals 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:33.290
 and as naturally want to very wide 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:36.920
 I am convinced that the tournament start 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:41.469
 that you can get involved in this for a long time 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.469
 can and therefore said
