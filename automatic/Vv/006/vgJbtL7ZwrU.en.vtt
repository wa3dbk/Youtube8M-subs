00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.719 
for me I kind of think it's almost his
fault<00:01:43.140> don't<00:01:44.100> want<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.280> take<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.549> away<00:01:44.640> from

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
fault don't want to take it away from

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.530 
fault don't want to take it away from
her<00:01:44.970> house<00:01:45.060> brilliant<00:01:45.750> free-kick<00:01:46.340> but<00:01:47.360> if<00:01:48.360> you

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
her house brilliant free-kick but if you

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.160 
her house brilliant free-kick but if you
look<00:01:48.720> at<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.960> replay<00:01:49.140> Guzan<00:01:49.799> was<00:01:50.009> so<00:01:50.399> on<00:01:50.840> his<00:01:51.840> I

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
look at the replay Guzan was so on his I

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.109 
look at the replay Guzan was so on his I
think<00:01:52.350> would<00:01:52.409> have<00:01:52.560> been<00:01:52.649> his<00:01:52.799> left<00:01:53.130> side<00:01:53.310> that

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
think would have been his left side that

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.480 
think would have been his left side that
I<00:01:54.479> don't<00:01:54.810> know<00:01:54.899> why<00:01:55.110> he<00:01:55.259> was<00:01:55.439> on<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:55.799> hugging

I don't know why he was on so hugging

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.249 
I don't know why he was on so hugging
that<00:01:56.640> post<00:01:56.939> more<00:01:57.240> than<00:01:57.450> he<00:01:57.600> was<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.049> side<00:01:58.229> i

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
that post more than he was the side i

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.170 
that post more than he was the side i
was<00:01:58.530> almost<00:01:58.710> blatantly<00:01:59.399> obvious<00:01:59.549> our<00:01:59.909> house

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180
