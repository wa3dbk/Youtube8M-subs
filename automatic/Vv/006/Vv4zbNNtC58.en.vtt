 the history of human evolution yes 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.520
 accompanies that of the modification of the 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.649
 his lifestyles 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.540
 also agriculture born in the age 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.400
 Neolithic was transformed 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.799
 man has passed from cultivating the earth 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.240
 with only the help of their own hands ad 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.250
 use and rudimentary tools 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.590
 help to remove the earth and 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.510
 prepare it for sowing by taming 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.400
 the animals managed to exploit the 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.920
 work to reduce time and effort 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.869
 in the preparation of the fields the first 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.880
 industrial revolution has allowed 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.710
 to the man to replace the animals with 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.719
 machines powered by mechanical energy 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.430
 in the continuous search for a 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.649
 improving one's standard of living 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.570
 in the second industrial revolution 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.760
 man brought innovations with 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.770
 the introduction of the electricity of the 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.140
 chemicals and oil in 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.730
 agriculture seeds have innovated 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.039
 and the supporting elements to the 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.050
 production by giving birth by developing i 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.390
 chemical fertilizers starting to produce 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.550
 even in a protected environment such as the greenhouse 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.289
 until today agriculture has not 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.670
 developed unlike all the 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.530
 other productive sectors 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.519
 a real innovation of 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.200

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.520
 given by a pvc panel this rests 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.860
 on a channel that in addition to 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.600
 support the panel and the island plant 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.790
 the root from the external environment 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.470
 the seed is germinated 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.270
 inside a special container 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.130

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.980
 it also collects all the real-time data 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:36.940
 statistical data of the cultivation 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:39.190
 keeping the greenhouse a historical archive 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.080
 with little industrial technology was nica 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.640
 offers the possibility to manage the 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.650
 cultivable surface 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.540
 according to different distribution schemes 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.580
 and through a channel system 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.540
 fixed and by means of an installation a 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.610
 mobile carts 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.890
 since the crop is released from the ground 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.510
 it is possible to create schemes from matching 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.970
 of the channel 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.569
 both horizontally and on that 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.310
 vertical 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:02.129
 this organizational system of the 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.870
 space offers some advantages allows it 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:05.970
 maximum exploitation of the surface 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.340
 cultivable by multiplying it by more 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.349
 levels boosting profitability for 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.480
 surface actually occupied e 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:14.700
 minimizing unproductive defects 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.739
 allows inside the greenhouse the 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.139
 contemporary cultivation of several species 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.329
 vegetables each inserted on a line 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:23.370
 of channels and managed with its own 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.919
 nutrient solution allows management 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.020
 of specific cultivation phases in environments 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:29.789
