00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
audio has been removed because basically

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.049 
audio has been removed because basically
it<00:00:53.250> will<00:00:53.399> loop<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.910> three<00:00:54.390> or<00:00:54.629> four<00:00:55.160> second<00:00:56.160> loop

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
it will loop a three or four second loop

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.090 
it will loop a three or four second loop
yeah<00:00:57.360> like<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.870> thread<00:00:58.230> second<00:00:58.620> portion<00:00:58.949> of

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
yeah like the thread second portion of

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.150 
yeah like the thread second portion of
the<00:00:59.250> cutscene<00:00:59.640> so<00:00:59.789> if<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.030> can<00:01:00.180> hear<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:01.160> mmm

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
the cutscene so if you can hear that mmm

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.490 
the cutscene so if you can hear that mmm
that<00:01:02.670> sound<00:01:02.940> like<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.449> know<00:01:03.570> Sparks<00:01:04.379> and

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
that sound like that you know Sparks and

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.530 
that sound like that you know Sparks and
that<00:01:04.739> will<00:01:05.129> just<00:01:05.250> keep<00:01:05.489> repeating<00:01:05.729> so<00:01:06.420> it's

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
that will just keep repeating so it's

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.500 
that will just keep repeating so it's
completely<00:01:07.080> pointless<00:01:08.000> here<00:01:09.000> we<00:01:09.119> are<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.450> is

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
go on dragon choice portal like that I'd

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.590 
go on dragon choice portal like that I'd
be<00:02:02.530> amazing<00:02:03.280> I<00:02:03.460> don't<00:02:03.909> think<00:02:04.300> that<00:02:04.450> was

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
be amazing I don't think that was

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.240 
be amazing I don't think that was
planned<00:02:04.899> but<00:02:05.530> I<00:02:05.590> don't<00:02:05.740> know<00:02:05.830> this<00:02:05.979> is<00:02:06.130> just

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
planned but I don't know this is just

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.779 
planned but I don't know this is just
awesome

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
awesome

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:09.990 
awesome
now<00:02:07.300> many<00:02:07.720> theorize<00:02:08.410> this<00:02:08.860> area<00:02:09.489> here<00:02:09.789> as

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
now many theorize this area here as

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.320 
now many theorize this area here as
being<00:02:10.380> basically<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:12.600> the<00:02:13.600> castle<00:02:14.260> from

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
being basically the the castle from

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.320 
being basically the the castle from
Spyro<00:02:16.330> one<00:02:17.340> really<00:02:18.340> it<00:02:18.580> kind<00:02:18.790> of<00:02:18.970> like<00:02:19.180> this

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
Spyro one really it kind of like this

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.729 
Spyro one really it kind of like this
whole<00:02:19.540> thing<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:19.930> that<00:02:20.019> all<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.230> suffering

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
whole thing and that all the suffering

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.860 
whole thing and that all the suffering
before<00:02:21.010> that<00:02:21.160> kind<00:02:21.310> of<00:02:21.430> resembles<00:02:21.819> you<00:02:22.750> know<00:02:22.840> a

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
before that kind of resembles you know a

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.479 
before that kind of resembles you know a
novel<00:02:23.530> Arion<00:02:24.190> world<00:02:25.000> but<00:02:25.480> yeah<00:02:25.870> either<00:02:26.140> way

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
novel Arion world but yeah either way

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.800 
novel Arion world but yeah either way
this<00:02:27.489> could<00:02:27.670> be<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.850> artisans<00:02:28.239> castle<00:02:28.660> I

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
this could be the artisans castle I

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.509 
this could be the artisans castle I
don't<00:02:29.110> really<00:02:29.530> think<00:02:29.620> it<00:02:29.950> is<00:02:30.100> and<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.370> way

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
don't really think it is and the way

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:31.550 
don't really think it is and the way
it's<00:02:30.700> designed<00:02:30.820> looks<00:02:31.180> slightly<00:02:31.360> different

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
it's designed looks slightly different

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.289 
it's designed looks slightly different
different<00:02:32.560> color<00:02:32.799> as<00:02:33.040> well<00:02:33.250> but<00:02:33.549> I<00:02:33.790> guess<00:02:34.150> this

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
different color as well but I guess this

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:35.970 
different color as well but I guess this
would<00:02:34.450> be<00:02:34.510> connected<00:02:35.140> to<00:02:35.230> that<00:02:35.260> world<00:02:35.590> because

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
would be connected to that world because

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.800 
would be connected to that world because
of<00:02:36.310> course<00:02:36.670> everyone<00:02:37.090> always<00:02:37.239> looks<00:02:37.570> at<00:02:37.690> this

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
of course everyone always looks at this

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.020 
of course everyone always looks at this
to<00:02:37.989> like<00:02:38.170> here's<00:02:38.440> a<00:02:38.769> well<00:02:39.700> you<00:02:39.910> know

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
to like here's a well you know

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.199 
to like here's a well you know
it's<00:02:40.180> like<00:02:40.329> the<00:02:40.450> one<00:02:40.630> in<00:02:41.790> it's<00:02:42.790> like<00:02:42.940> the<00:02:43.060> one

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
it's like the one in it's like the one

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.289 
it's like the one in it's like the one
in<00:02:44.100> stone<00:02:45.100> hill<00:02:45.310> you<00:02:45.579> know<00:02:45.640> I<00:02:45.730> mean<00:02:45.910> but<00:02:46.120> it's

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
in stone hill you know I mean but it's

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.300 
in stone hill you know I mean but it's
not<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:46.720> same<00:02:46.959> place<00:02:47.320> it's<00:02:47.590> very<00:02:47.769> clear<00:02:48.160> that

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
not the same place it's very clear that

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
it is definitely connected to the Spyro

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.020 
it is definitely connected to the Spyro
the<00:02:53.530> sa<00:02:53.829> way<00:02:54.040> to<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.519> Spyro

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
the sa way to the Spyro

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.810

the<00:03:20.450> right<00:03:20.660> the<00:03:20.810> raining<00:03:21.260> version<00:03:21.650> two<00:03:21.769> cuts

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
the right the raining version two cuts

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.759 
the right the raining version two cuts
in<00:03:22.160> by<00:03:22.790> doing<00:03:23.209> it<00:03:23.450> at<00:03:23.750> the<00:03:23.900> middle<00:03:24.170> of<00:03:24.380> the<00:03:24.530> game

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769

in by doing it at the middle of the game
now<00:03:25.519> I<00:03:25.550> also<00:03:25.940> wonder<00:03:26.510> whether<00:03:26.780> it's<00:03:27.019> actually

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.699 
now I also wonder whether it's actually
possible<00:03:27.680> to<00:03:27.950> do<00:03:28.160> this<00:03:28.430> with<00:03:29.390> Spyro<00:03:30.050> 3<00:03:30.170> because

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
possible to do this with Spyro 3 because

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.070 
possible to do this with Spyro 3 because
that<00:03:31.190> would<00:03:31.370> be<00:03:31.550> awesome<00:03:31.730> better<00:03:32.599> view<00:03:32.930> some

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
that would be awesome better view some

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.809 
that would be awesome better view some
extra<00:03:33.410> you<00:03:33.620> know<00:03:33.709> extra<00:03:34.099> places<00:03:34.400> and<00:03:34.670> stuff

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
extra you know extra places and stuff

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
like that we've been to inspire a thread

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:38.800 
like that we've been to inspire a thread

here<00:03:51.470> by<00:03:51.620> the<00:03:51.680> way<00:03:51.829> I<00:03:51.860> did<00:03:52.400> this<00:03:52.700> is<00:03:52.819> like

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
here by the way I did this is like

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.390 
here by the way I did this is like
another<00:03:53.239> file<00:03:53.599> that's<00:03:54.380> a<00:03:54.590> big<00:03:54.769> mistake<00:03:54.920> I've

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
another file that's a big mistake I've

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.100 
another file that's a big mistake I've
now<00:03:55.640> lost<00:03:55.849> that<00:03:56.090> file<00:03:56.360> pretty<00:03:56.930> much

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
now lost that file pretty much

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.100

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
permanently it will always crash so this

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.930 
permanently it will always crash so this
is<00:04:00.380> solid<00:04:00.829> right<00:04:01.010> but<00:04:01.280> under<00:04:01.459> the<00:04:01.700> castle

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
is screwed this side isn't also worth

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.370 
is screwed this side isn't also worth
noting<00:04:44.990> that<00:04:45.910> these<00:04:46.910> portals<00:04:47.539> here<00:04:47.840> kind<00:04:48.350> of
