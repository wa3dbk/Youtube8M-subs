answer
this<00:02:09.560> incorrectly<00:02:10.459> and<00:02:10.819> it's<00:02:11.330> because<00:02:11.810> of<00:02:12.110> the

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
this incorrectly and it's because of the

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.420 
this incorrectly and it's because of the
visual<00:02:12.920> clues<00:02:13.520> of<00:02:13.550> this<00:02:14.060> fabric<00:02:14.860> these<00:02:15.860> little

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
visual clues of this fabric these little

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.360 
visual clues of this fabric these little
V's<00:02:16.670> give<00:02:17.599> a<00:02:17.810> vertical<00:02:18.349> pattern<00:02:18.620> effect<00:02:19.130> and

V's give a vertical pattern effect and

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.430 
V's give a vertical pattern effect and
they<00:02:19.580> almost<00:02:19.730> look<00:02:20.060> like<00:02:20.150> arrows<00:02:20.720> going<00:02:21.170> up

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
they almost look like arrows going up

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.510 
they almost look like arrows going up
and<00:02:21.680> down<00:02:21.830> but<00:02:22.640> think<00:02:23.209> of<00:02:23.300> a<00:02:23.900> typical

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.979 
and a half rows per inch for example
there<00:02:30.650> are<00:02:30.680> always<00:02:31.130> more<00:02:31.670> rows<00:02:32.000> than<00:02:32.330> stitches

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
there are always more rows than stitches

there are always more rows than stitches
per<00:02:33.200> inch<00:02:33.230> and<00:02:33.680> the<00:02:33.739> stitch<00:02:34.700> is<00:02:34.970> about<00:02:35.360> three

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
per inch and the stitch is about three

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.800 
per inch and the stitch is about three
quarters<00:02:36.140> high<00:02:36.680> as<00:02:37.040> it<00:02:37.280> is<00:02:37.310> wide<00:02:37.790> this<00:02:38.510> is<00:02:38.569> an

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
quarters high as it is wide this is an

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.600 
quarters high as it is wide this is an
important<00:02:39.290> piece<00:02:39.440> of<00:02:39.470> information<00:02:39.920> to<00:02:40.430> know

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
important piece of information to know

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.820 
important piece of information to know
because<00:02:40.880> there<00:02:41.209> are<00:02:41.269> many<00:02:41.390> implications<00:02:41.830> this

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
because there are many implications this

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.190 
because there are many implications this
is<00:02:43.040> why<00:02:43.280> for<00:02:43.610> example<00:02:43.640> you<00:02:44.239> need<00:02:44.390> to<00:02:44.569> cast<00:02:44.840> on

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
is why for example you need to cast on

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.250 
is why for example you need to cast on
and<00:02:45.470> bind<00:02:46.069> off<00:02:46.280> loosely<00:02:46.850> that<00:02:47.030> loose<00:02:47.930> short

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260

stitch is lying down over its wider

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.840 
stitch is lying down over its wider
neighbor<00:02:50.930> so<00:02:51.590> it<00:02:51.709> needs<00:02:51.950> to<00:02:52.069> be<00:02:52.190> taller<00:02:52.580> than

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
neighbor so it needs to be taller than

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.789 
neighbor so it needs to be taller than
usual<00:02:53.030> to<00:02:53.360> keep<00:02:53.540> this<00:02:53.750> edge<00:02:54.019> from<00:02:54.290> being<00:02:54.590> too

armhole in this case you have stitches

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.740 
armhole in this case you have stitches
that<00:03:04.130> come<00:03:04.340> together<00:03:04.489> at<00:03:04.940> right<00:03:05.239> angles

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
this one was done I showed you how to do

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.560 
this one was done I showed you how to do
that<00:03:26.750> in<00:03:26.959> 1992<00:03:27.890> but<00:03:28.670> just<00:03:28.880> in<00:03:29.060> case<00:03:29.090> you've

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
that in 1992 but just in case you've

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.479 
that in 1992 but just in case you've
forgotten<00:03:29.600> or<00:03:30.410> gotten<00:03:30.739> a<00:03:30.799> little<00:03:30.950> bit<00:03:31.220> rusty

on<00:03:31.850> that<00:03:32.030> skill<00:03:32.420> you<00:03:32.870> can<00:03:33.079> find<00:03:33.350> it<00:03:33.530> right<00:03:33.709> here

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
on that skill you can find it right here

on that skill you can find it right here
and<00:03:34.250> review<00:03:34.700> at<00:03:34.820> any<00:03:34.970> time<00:03:35.390> but<00:03:36.320> there<00:03:36.500> are

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
and review at any time but there are

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.890 
and review at any time but there are
times<00:03:36.980> when<00:03:37.280> you<00:03:37.370> really<00:03:37.400> do<00:03:37.940> need<00:03:38.269> to<00:03:38.600> graph

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
times when you really do need to graph

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.569 
times when you really do need to graph
them<00:03:39.170> together<00:03:39.320> you<00:03:39.709> just<00:03:39.739> can't<00:03:40.190> pick<00:03:40.430> up

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
them together you just can't pick up

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:42.640 
them together you just can't pick up
along<00:03:40.910> the<00:03:41.060> armhole<00:03:41.450> edge<00:03:41.690> and<00:03:41.959> knit<00:03:42.170> down<00:03:42.380> and

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
along the armhole edge and knit down and

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.729 
along the armhole edge and knit down and
here's<00:03:43.160> an<00:03:43.280> example<00:03:43.370> of<00:03:43.910> that<00:03:44.320> the<00:03:45.320> body<00:03:45.590> of

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
here's an example of that the body of

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:47.710 
here's an example of that the body of
this<00:03:46.010> sweater<00:03:46.310> is<00:03:46.519> all<00:03:46.820> stockinette<00:03:47.570> stitch

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
this sweater is all stockinette stitch

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.380 
this sweater is all stockinette stitch
but<00:03:48.410> because<00:03:48.890> of<00:03:48.920> this<00:03:49.459> complex<00:03:50.060> color

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
but because of this complex color

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.710 
but because of this complex color
pattern<00:03:50.870> it<00:03:51.410> looks<00:03:51.680> different<00:03:52.010> going<00:03:52.720> this

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
pattern it looks different going this

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.410 
pattern it looks different going this
direction<00:03:53.900> from<00:03:54.650> going<00:03:54.950> that<00:03:55.430> direction<00:03:55.609> so<00:03:56.120> I

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
direction from going that direction so I

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.199 
direction from going that direction so I
knit<00:03:56.930> the<00:03:57.109> body<00:03:57.290> pieces<00:03:57.950> and<00:03:58.370> the<00:03:58.819> sleeves

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
knit the body pieces and the sleeves

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.449 
knit the body pieces and the sleeves
from<00:03:59.569> the<00:03:59.750> bottom<00:04:00.079> up<00:04:00.260> and<00:04:00.440> then<00:04:00.829> grafted<00:04:01.430> them

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
from the bottom up and then grafted them

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.940 
from the bottom up and then grafted them
together<00:04:01.730> and<00:04:02.269> today<00:04:02.989> I'm<00:04:03.290> going<00:04:03.500> to<00:04:03.650> show<00:04:03.920> you

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
together and today I'm going to show you

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.629 
together and today I'm going to show you
this<00:04:04.579> technique<00:04:05.170> how<00:04:06.170> to<00:04:06.230> graft<00:04:06.560> things<00:04:06.950> at<00:04:07.220> 90

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:07.639 
this technique how to graft things at 90

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:13.150 
this technique how to graft things at 90
degrees<00:04:08.000> to<00:04:08.209> one<00:04:08.359> another<00:04:10.299> yes<00:04:11.829> line<00:04:12.829> up<00:04:13.010> your

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
degrees to one another yes line up your

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.400 
degrees to one another yes line up your
swatches<00:04:13.670> and<00:04:13.819> usually<00:04:14.660> if<00:04:14.810> you<00:04:14.959> were<00:04:15.109> doing

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
swatches and usually if you were doing

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:16.930 
swatches and usually if you were doing
this<00:04:15.500> you<00:04:15.560> wouldn't<00:04:15.920> do<00:04:16.070> it<00:04:16.100> in<00:04:16.310> the<00:04:16.430> very<00:04:16.639> end

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
this you wouldn't do it in the very end

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.000 
this you wouldn't do it in the very end
stitch<00:04:17.659> this<00:04:17.900> would<00:04:18.109> be<00:04:18.260> a<00:04:18.289> sleeve<00:04:18.680> and<00:04:18.919> you

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
stitch this would be a sleeve and you

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.009 
stitch this would be a sleeve and you
would<00:04:19.130> be<00:04:19.280> attaching<00:04:19.820> it<00:04:19.940> somewhere<00:04:20.359> in<00:04:20.690> the

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019
