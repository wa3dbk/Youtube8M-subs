anything it's just like peeling away the
dead<00:03:29.180> layers<00:03:29.570> I<00:03:29.900> guess<00:03:30.110> but<00:03:30.350> it's<00:03:31.040> not<00:03:31.250> painful

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
dead layers I guess but it's not painful

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.360 
dead layers I guess but it's not painful
and<00:03:32.120> it's<00:03:32.930> just<00:03:33.140> kind<00:03:33.320> of<00:03:33.350> fun<00:03:33.410> because<00:03:33.920> it

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
and it's just kind of fun because it

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.120 
and it's just kind of fun because it
comes<00:03:34.610> off<00:03:34.790> in<00:03:35.000> sections<00:03:35.540> when<00:03:36.350> it's<00:03:36.500> dry<00:03:36.830> but

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
comes off in sections when it's dry but

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.770 
comes off in sections when it's dry but
you<00:03:37.340> have<00:03:37.459> to<00:03:37.550> wait<00:03:37.670> till<00:03:37.850> it's<00:03:37.970> really<00:03:38.239> dry<00:03:38.450> so
