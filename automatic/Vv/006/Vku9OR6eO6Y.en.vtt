you to change out your in-game site with
other<00:01:33.100> attachments<00:01:33.790> for<00:01:33.940> better<00:01:34.210> performance

other attachments for better performance
so<00:01:35.410> for<00:01:35.560> example<00:01:36.010> if<00:01:36.220> you're<00:01:36.550> running<00:01:36.820> with

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
so for example if you're running with

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.640 
so for example if you're running with
the<00:01:37.030> Peacekeeper<00:01:37.600> and<00:01:37.780> you're<00:01:38.230> outfitted

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.420 
with a silencer and in-game red dot
sight<00:01:40.870> you<00:01:41.500> can<00:01:41.530> now<00:01:41.830> change<00:01:42.130> out<00:01:42.400> your

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
sight you can now change out your

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.180 
sight you can now change out your
in-game<00:01:43.090> sight<00:01:43.450> with<00:01:43.840> the<00:01:43.960> hip<00:01:44.110> shot<00:01:44.290> dot<00:01:44.560> this

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
in-game sight with the hip shot dot this

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.830 
in-game sight with the hip shot dot this
gives<00:01:45.400> you<00:01:45.520> an<00:01:45.580> additional<00:01:45.880> attachment<00:01:46.690> and

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
gives you an additional attachment and

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.170 
gives you an additional attachment and
ultimately<00:01:47.740> the<00:01:48.040> advantage<00:01:48.640> over<00:01:48.850> other

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
ultimately the advantage over other
