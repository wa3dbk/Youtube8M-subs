not<00:01:19.560> really<00:01:20.340> buildable<00:01:20.820> because<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.509> mean

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
not really buildable because I mean

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.240

helmet how much moisturizer can put on

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.410 
helmet how much moisturizer can put on
your<00:01:23.310> face<00:01:23.549> supposed<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.240> have<00:01:24.330> like

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
your face supposed to have like

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.130 
your face supposed to have like
moisturizers<00:01:26.060> sunscreen<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.360> then<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.780> little

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
moisturizers sunscreen and then a little

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.280 
moisturizers sunscreen and then a little
bit<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.439> color<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:29.070> give<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.869> some<00:01:30.869> coverage

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
bit of color to give you some coverage

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.590 
bit of color to give you some coverage
so<00:01:31.829> this<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.220> definitely<00:01:32.610> not<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.299> full

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
so this is definitely not a full

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.149 
so this is definitely not a full
coverage<00:01:33.780> foundation<00:01:33.960> or<00:01:35.509> a<00:01:36.770> pigmented<00:01:37.770> like

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
coverage foundation or a pigmented like

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.450 
coverage foundation or a pigmented like
tinted<00:01:38.490> moisturizer<00:01:39.030> it's<00:01:40.040> says<00:01:41.040> here<00:01:41.280> like

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
tinted moisturizer it's says here like

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.830 
tinted moisturizer it's says here like
on<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.700> back<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:42.000> says<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.299> purpose<00:01:42.509> is

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
on the back it says the purpose is

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.330 
on the back it says the purpose is
sunscreen<00:01:43.409> so<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.740> can<00:01:43.950> see<00:01:44.130> where<00:01:44.250> the

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
sunscreen so I can see where the

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.030 
sunscreen so I can see where the
sunscreen<00:01:44.850> part<00:01:45.119> comes<00:01:45.329> in<00:01:45.479> because<00:01:45.860> if<00:01:46.860> you

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
sunscreen part comes in because if you

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.350 
sunscreen part comes in because if you
think<00:01:47.189> of<00:01:47.340> sunscreen<00:01:47.759> what<00:01:47.939> colors<00:01:48.210> do<00:01:48.299> you

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
think of sunscreen what colors do you

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.539 
think of sunscreen what colors do you
think<00:01:48.540> of<00:01:48.659> white<00:01:48.930> right<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.860> if<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.340> put

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
think of white right so if you put

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.060 
think of white right so if you put
sunscreen<00:01:51.060> in<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.630> mix<00:01:51.990> of<00:01:52.200> your<00:01:52.590> foundation

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
sunscreen in the mix of your foundation

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.010 
sunscreen in the mix of your foundation
your<00:01:53.850> foundation<00:01:54.299> is<00:01:54.420> going<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.659> get<00:01:54.780> lighter

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
your foundation is going to get lighter

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.080 
your foundation is going to get lighter
because<00:01:55.350> you're<00:01:55.590> adding<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.070> white<00:01:56.490> color<00:01:56.790> to

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
because you're adding the white color to

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.380 
because you're adding the white color to
it<00:01:57.240> so<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:57.990> is<00:01:58.229> lighter<00:01:58.829> than<00:01:59.399> my<00:01:59.579> complexion

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
it so it is lighter than my complexion

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.330 
it so it is lighter than my complexion
but<00:02:00.810> as<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.170> as<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.469> can<00:02:01.619> see<00:02:01.799> there<00:02:02.040> is<00:02:02.159> an

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
but as you as you can see there is an

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.889 
but as you as you can see there is an
even<00:02:02.670> tone<00:02:02.850> here<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:03.240> it's<00:02:03.329> not<00:02:03.420> like<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.600> white

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
even tone here so it's not like a white

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.200 
even tone here so it's not like a white
pie<00:02:04.170> face<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:04.770> then<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:04.890> brown<00:02:05.159> neck<00:02:05.490> so<00:02:06.180> I

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
pie face and then a brown neck so I

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.419 
pie face and then a brown neck so I
guess<00:02:06.719> it<00:02:06.840> just<00:02:07.020> really<00:02:07.200> depends<00:02:07.649> on<00:02:07.890> your

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
guess it just really depends on your

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.840 
guess it just really depends on your
skin<00:02:08.910> color<00:02:09.209> now<00:02:09.899> I'm<00:02:10.140> not<00:02:10.440> sure<00:02:10.470> if<00:02:10.830> they<00:02:11.340> make

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
skin color now I'm not sure if they make

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.930 
skin color now I'm not sure if they make
we<00:02:12.000> creams<00:02:12.270> for<00:02:12.750> girls<00:02:13.410> with<00:02:13.650> deeper<00:02:14.070> skin

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
we creams for girls with deeper skin

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.360 
we creams for girls with deeper skin
tones<00:02:15.240> because<00:02:15.780> they're<00:02:16.560> so<00:02:16.830> light<00:02:17.130> on<00:02:17.160> my

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
tones because they're so light on my

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.310 
tones because they're so light on my
damn<00:02:17.580> if<00:02:17.760> my<00:02:17.910> tan<00:02:18.240> was<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.510> little<00:02:18.750> bit<00:02:18.840> deeper<00:02:19.020> I

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
damn if my tan was a little bit deeper I

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.900 
damn if my tan was a little bit deeper I
would<00:02:19.620> not<00:02:19.770> be<00:02:19.950> able<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.280> wear<00:02:20.430> this<00:02:20.580> because

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.690 
would not be able to wear this because

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.060 
and this is light to medium I think the

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.019 
and this is light to medium I think the
product<00:06:10.479> is<00:06:10.810> a<00:06:10.870> little<00:06:11.289> bit<00:06:11.469> light<00:06:11.800> so<00:06:12.520> if<00:06:12.789> you

00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:13.029 
product is a little bit light so if you

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:16.589 
product is a little bit light so if you
are<00:06:13.389> more<00:06:14.319> tan<00:06:14.589> than<00:06:14.620> I<00:06:15.009> am<00:06:15.250> like<00:06:15.520> my<00:06:16.120> arms<00:06:16.479> a

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:16.599 
are more tan than I am like my arms a

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:19.249 
are more tan than I am like my arms a
little<00:06:16.719> bit<00:06:16.900> darker<00:06:17.289> than<00:06:17.439> my<00:06:17.589> face<00:06:18.009> is<00:06:18.310> I

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:19.259 
little bit darker than my face is I

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:21.510 
little bit darker than my face is I
would<00:06:20.259> definitely<00:06:20.680> probably<00:06:20.889> try<00:06:21.159> to<00:06:21.219> go<00:06:21.370> with

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 
would definitely probably try to go with

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.269 
would definitely probably try to go with
the<00:06:21.629> next<00:06:22.629> color<00:06:23.169> which<00:06:23.500> is<00:06:23.620> probably<00:06:23.889> medium

00:06:24.269 --> 00:06:24.279 
the next color which is probably medium

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:27.119 
the next color which is probably medium
to<00:06:24.460> dark<00:06:24.729> or<00:06:25.360> buy<00:06:25.960> them<00:06:26.199> both<00:06:26.379> and<00:06:26.650> mix<00:06:26.889> them<00:06:27.099> so

00:06:27.119 --> 00:06:27.129 
to dark or buy them both and mix them so

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:29.490
