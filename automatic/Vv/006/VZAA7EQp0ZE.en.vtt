00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:30.939 
project I just think this idea of being

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.299 
project I just think this idea of being
outside<00:00:31.480> and<00:00:31.840> experiencing<00:00:32.800> nature<00:00:32.980> has

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:39.129 
think that's really the genesis of the

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:42.000 
think that's really the genesis of the
whole<00:00:39.399> garden<00:00:39.850> home<00:00:40.059> concept<00:00:40.690> it<00:00:40.989> is<00:00:41.140> garden

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
whole garden home concept it is garden

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.549

home home &amp; garden and blurring the

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.299 
home home &amp; garden and blurring the

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
lines between both of those rounds since

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.880 
lines between both of those rounds since
proportion<00:00:49.179> and<00:00:49.300> scale<00:00:49.449> is<00:00:49.839> so<00:00:49.989> important<00:00:50.769> in

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
proportion and scale is so important in

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.099 
proportion and scale is so important in
this<00:00:51.100> style<00:00:51.399> of<00:00:51.609> architecture<00:00:51.820> I<00:00:52.570> really

00:00:53.099 --> 00:00:53.109 
this style of architecture I really

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:55.380 
this style of architecture I really
wanted<00:00:53.409> to<00:00:53.469> make<00:00:53.679> sure<00:00:53.739> that<00:00:54.010> the<00:00:54.760> windows<00:00:55.179> fit

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.599 
wanted to make sure that the windows fit
and<00:00:55.539> so<00:00:55.659> when<00:00:55.809> we<00:00:55.839> drew<00:00:56.530> them<00:00:56.710> out<00:00:56.920> I<00:00:56.949> thought

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:57.609 
and so when we drew them out I thought

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:00.270 
and so when we drew them out I thought
heavens<00:00:58.089> are<00:00:58.239> so<00:00:58.449> big<00:00:58.839> but<00:00:59.499> they<00:00:59.620> really<00:00:59.829> fit

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
heavens are so big but they really fit

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.399 
heavens are so big but they really fit
the<00:01:00.339> place<00:01:00.789> and<00:01:01.089> that's<00:01:01.210> what's<00:01:01.449> so<00:01:01.719> important

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:02.409 
the place and that's what's so important

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:04.710 
the place and that's what's so important
