if you were equipping a craft to go to

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.630 
if you were equipping a craft to go to
Mars<00:01:14.619> what<00:01:15.619> do<00:01:15.770> you<00:01:15.829> put<00:01:16.039> on<00:01:16.100> it<00:01:16.340> and<00:01:16.490> what

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
Mars what do you put on it and what

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.730

don't<00:01:16.880> you<00:01:17.000> put<00:01:17.329> on<00:01:17.450> it<00:01:17.600> right<00:01:18.439> now<00:01:18.469> for

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
don't you put on it right now for

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.249 
don't you put on it right now for
example<00:01:19.009> on<00:01:19.609> Space<00:01:20.329> Station<00:01:20.359> if<00:01:20.810> someone<00:01:21.140> were

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
to have a serious illness or injury the

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:24.940 
to have a serious illness or injury the
idea<00:01:23.929> would<00:01:24.079> be<00:01:24.109> to<00:01:24.200> get<00:01:24.469> them<00:01:24.679> back<00:01:24.770> to

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
idea would be to get them back to

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.039 
idea would be to get them back to
stabilize<00:01:25.249> them<00:01:25.759> get<00:01:26.240> them<00:01:26.390> back<00:01:26.539> to<00:01:26.659> Earth<00:01:26.810> as

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
stabilize them get them back to Earth as

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:29.469 
stabilize them get them back to Earth as

these longer longer duration space
flights<00:01:31.939> we<00:01:32.509> have<00:01:32.600> to<00:01:32.749> think<00:01:32.960> about<00:01:33.049> doing

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829

to<00:01:41.600> begin<00:01:41.749> to<00:01:42.049> think<00:01:42.200> about<00:01:42.289> how<00:01:42.590> do<00:01:42.649> we<00:01:42.859> test

sclerosis<00:02:19.659> and<00:02:19.689> a<00:02:19.870> drug<00:02:20.049> for<00:02:20.170> malaria<00:02:20.319> Niger<00:02:20.950> I

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:23.729 
sclerosis and a drug for malaria Niger I
mean<00:02:21.510> so<00:02:22.510> in<00:02:22.720> fact<00:02:22.989> they're<00:02:23.379> going<00:02:23.590> to<00:02:23.650> be

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
mean so in fact they're going to be

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.470 
mean so in fact they're going to be
experiments<00:02:24.340> that<00:02:24.489> happen<00:02:24.819> in<00:02:24.939> real<00:02:25.180> time

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
experiments that happen in real time

experiments that happen in real time
clinical<00:02:26.079> experiments<00:02:26.680> if<00:02:27.010> you<00:02:27.579> have<00:02:27.730> five

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
clinical experiments if you have five

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.600 
clinical experiments if you have five
drugs<00:02:28.480> that<00:02:28.720> treat<00:02:28.840> five<00:02:29.500> related<00:02:30.159> syndromes

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
drugs that treat five related syndromes

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.449 
drugs that treat five related syndromes
really<00:02:31.030> well<00:02:31.209> or<00:02:31.870> one<00:02:32.379> drug<00:02:32.739> that<00:02:32.769> treats<00:02:33.159> them

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
really well or one drug that treats them

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.839 
really well or one drug that treats them
all<00:02:33.610> but<00:02:33.879> not<00:02:34.269> nearly<00:02:34.720> as<00:02:34.959> well<00:02:35.280> well<00:02:36.280> on<00:02:36.819> a

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
all but not nearly as well well on a

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:38.490 
all but not nearly as well well on a
spacecraft<00:02:37.180> you<00:02:37.569> probably<00:02:37.900> choose<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.319> one

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
spacecraft you probably choose the one

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.649 
spacecraft you probably choose the one
drug<00:02:38.739> because<00:02:39.159> one<00:02:39.430> of<00:02:39.459> the<00:02:39.640> big<00:02:39.939> issues<00:02:40.209> in

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:40.659 
drug because one of the big issues in

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:44.429 
drug because one of the big issues in
spaceflight<00:02:41.379> is<00:02:41.799> mass<00:02:42.099> or<00:02:42.670> up<00:02:43.000> mass<00:02:43.439> and

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:44.439 
spaceflight is mass or up mass and

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:46.740 
spaceflight is mass or up mass and
that's<00:02:44.920> NASA's<00:02:45.519> term<00:02:45.700> for<00:02:45.970> weight<00:02:46.180> basically

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
that's NASA's term for weight basically

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.929 
that's NASA's term for weight basically
for<00:02:47.379> every<00:02:47.470> ounce<00:02:47.709> you<00:02:47.950> put<00:02:48.159> on<00:02:48.310> the<00:02:48.519> craft<00:02:48.819> you

00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:48.939 
for every ounce you put on the craft you

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:51.899 
for every ounce you put on the craft you
have<00:02:49.090> to<00:02:49.209> take<00:02:49.390> something<00:02:49.840> off<00:02:50.489> so<00:02:51.489> you<00:02:51.549> can't

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:51.909 
have to take something off so you can't

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:53.970 
have to take something off so you can't
have<00:02:52.150> an<00:02:52.329> enormous<00:02:52.629> formulary<00:02:53.409> of<00:02:53.560> drugs<00:02:53.829> you

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
have an enormous formulary of drugs you

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.069 
have an enormous formulary of drugs you
can't<00:02:54.220> have<00:02:54.430> an<00:02:54.549> x-ray<00:02:54.879> machine<00:02:54.909> you<00:02:55.810> can't

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
can't have an x-ray machine you can't

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.649 
can't have an x-ray machine you can't
have<00:02:56.260> an<00:02:56.379> MRI<00:02:57.180> maybe<00:02:58.180> you<00:02:58.389> could<00:02:58.510> have<00:02:58.629> a

00:02:58.649 --> 00:02:58.659 
have an MRI maybe you could have a

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:02.280 
have an MRI maybe you could have a
handheld<00:02:59.200> ultrasound<00:03:00.000> so<00:03:01.000> all<00:03:01.359> of<00:03:01.900> those<00:03:02.049> are

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
handheld ultrasound so all of those are

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.750 
handheld ultrasound so all of those are
decisions<00:03:02.650> that<00:03:02.920> have<00:03:03.159> to<00:03:03.189> be<00:03:03.340> made<00:03:03.609> very

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
decisions that have to be made very

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.649 
decisions that have to be made very

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.930 
really know what two and a half or three
years<00:03:23.709> which<00:03:23.889> is<00:03:24.010> probably<00:03:24.310> what<00:03:24.459> a<00:03:24.489> Mars

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
years which is probably what a Mars

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.439 
years which is probably what a Mars
mission<00:03:25.030> would<00:03:25.629> take<00:03:26.099> on<00:03:27.099> a<00:03:27.489> spacecraft<00:03:27.910> with

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
exploratory capacity knowing they'll

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
that they will die early that is we'll

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:57.539 
that they will die early that is we'll
send<00:03:56.260> them<00:03:56.409> there<00:03:56.620> there's<00:03:56.829> no<00:03:57.010> way<00:03:57.190> for<00:03:57.250> them

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
send them there there's no way for them

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.069 
send them there there's no way for them
to<00:03:57.609> get<00:03:57.819> back<00:03:58.000> eventually<00:03:58.150> their<00:03:58.599> food<00:03:58.870> or

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
to get back eventually their food or

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:00.539 
to get back eventually their food or
their<00:03:59.229> oxygen<00:03:59.709> will<00:03:59.859> run<00:04:00.010> out<00:04:00.159> and<00:04:00.370> they'll

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
their oxygen will run out and they'll

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:04.020 
their oxygen will run out and they'll
die<00:04:00.760> this<00:04:01.590> second<00:04:02.699> iteration<00:04:03.699> of<00:04:03.970> that

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
die this second iteration of that

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.689 
die this second iteration of that
question<00:04:04.569> now<00:04:04.780> is<00:04:05.139> is<00:04:05.769> it<00:04:06.010> okay<00:04:06.310> to<00:04:06.370> send

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:06.699 
question now is is it okay to send

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:09.089 
question now is is it okay to send
someone<00:04:07.000> to<00:04:07.120> Mars<00:04:07.449> having<00:04:08.199> set<00:04:08.590> up<00:04:08.709> some<00:04:08.919> kind

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:09.099 
someone to Mars having set up some kind

someone to Mars having set up some kind
of<00:04:09.190> habitat<00:04:09.699> there<00:04:09.909> that<00:04:10.060> will<00:04:10.180> keep<00:04:10.299> them

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
of habitat there that will keep them

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.569 
of habitat there that will keep them
alive<00:04:10.780> for<00:04:10.840> the<00:04:11.709> rest<00:04:11.889> of<00:04:12.040> their<00:04:12.129> life<00:04:12.310> however

to<00:04:31.120> do<00:04:31.300> this<00:04:31.540> we<00:04:32.350> don't<00:04:32.560> in<00:04:32.740> one<00:04:32.950> sense<00:04:33.220> have<00:04:33.370> a

to do this we don't in one sense have a

to do this we don't in one sense have a

right to stop them what's interesting
about<00:04:35.710> this<00:04:36.250> is<00:04:36.550> I<00:04:37.320> don't<00:04:38.320> think<00:04:38.500> the

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
about this is I don't think the

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.640 
about this is I don't think the
government<00:04:39.100> can<00:04:39.460> do<00:04:39.610> that<00:04:40.139> that<00:04:41.139> is<00:04:41.350> the

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
government can do that that is the

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.409 
government can do that that is the
government<00:04:42.220> answers<00:04:42.700> to<00:04:42.820> the<00:04:42.940> people<00:04:43.240> as<00:04:43.389> a

government answers to the people as a

government answers to the people as a
whole<00:04:43.840> and<00:04:44.169> I<00:04:44.470> don't<00:04:44.530> think<00:04:45.120> the<00:04:46.120> public

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:46.389 
whole and I don't think the public

whole and I don't think the public
morality<00:04:47.790> will<00:04:48.790> allow<00:04:49.090> or<00:04:49.360> should<00:04:50.080> allow

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.920 
to Mars aside from just human beings but
there<00:05:19.479> is<00:05:19.840> a<00:05:20.350> real<00:05:21.310> ethical<00:05:21.910> tension<00:05:22.450> there

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
there is a real ethical tension there

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.990 
there is a real ethical tension there
about<00:05:23.740> what<00:05:23.950> right<00:05:24.160> we<00:05:24.340> have<00:05:24.550> to<00:05:24.729> begin<00:05:24.850> to

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
about what right we have to begin to

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.820 
about what right we have to begin to
colonize<00:05:25.540> other<00:05:25.750> planets<00:05:25.840> and<00:05:26.320> turn<00:05:26.590> them

colonize other planets and turn them

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.490 
colonize other planets and turn them
into<00:05:27.100> some<00:05:27.820> kind<00:05:27.850> of<00:05:28.240> a<00:05:28.330> version<00:05:28.570> of<00:05:28.900> Earth<00:05:29.139> and

into some kind of a version of Earth and

into some kind of a version of Earth and
it's<00:05:30.490> only<00:05:30.880> in<00:05:31.180> science<00:05:31.600> fiction<00:05:31.960> that<00:05:32.110> we've

it's only in science fiction that we've

it's only in science fiction that we've

kind of a public way but people do talk

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.250 
kind of a public way but people do talk
about<00:05:36.460> it<00:05:36.880> and<00:05:37.060> we're<00:05:37.900> particularly

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260 
about it and we're particularly

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.290 
about it and we're particularly
interested<00:05:38.410> in<00:05:38.770> space<00:05:39.010> but<00:05:39.820> it's<00:05:40.000> going<00:05:40.120> to<00:05:40.180> be

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
interested in space but it's going to be

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.880 
interested in space but it's going to be
time<00:05:40.570> pretty<00:05:40.780> soon<00:05:40.900> for<00:05:41.350> the<00:05:41.410> public<00:05:41.740> as<00:05:41.860> a

whole to weigh in on that and it's not

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.810 
whole to weigh in on that and it's not
only<00:05:43.960> about<00:05:44.169> introducing<00:05:44.680> life<00:05:45.070> it's<00:05:45.580> also

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
only about introducing life it's also

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.840 
only about introducing life it's also
about<00:05:46.180> ownership<00:05:46.590> who<00:05:47.590> owns<00:05:47.800> the<00:05:48.039> moon<00:05:48.190> who

about ownership who owns the moon who

about ownership who owns the moon who
owns<00:05:49.030> Mars<00:05:49.419> is<00:05:50.169> it<00:05:50.440> the<00:05:50.560> first<00:05:50.770> country<00:05:51.100> that

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.640 
owns Mars is it the first country that
gets<00:05:51.460> there<00:05:51.900> do<00:05:52.900> they<00:05:52.990> get<00:05:53.169> to<00:05:53.289> claim<00:05:53.500> the

gets there do they get to claim the
whole<00:05:53.770> planet<00:05:54.370> or<00:05:54.640> are<00:05:55.060> we<00:05:55.150> going<00:05:55.300> to<00:05:55.479> try<00:05:55.630> to

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
whole planet or are we going to try to

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.600 
whole planet or are we going to try to
make<00:05:56.800> these<00:05:57.039> either<00:05:58.320> distribute<00:05:59.320> it<00:05:59.440> around

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
make these either distribute it around

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.610 
make these either distribute it around
the<00:06:00.610> world<00:06:00.789> or<00:06:01.150> make<00:06:01.419> them<00:06:01.630> public<00:06:02.110> resources

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
the world or make them public resources

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.550 
the world or make them public resources
so<00:06:03.490> that<00:06:03.760> nobody<00:06:04.180> really<00:06:04.600> gets<00:06:04.720> to<00:06:04.930> own<00:06:05.110> the

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
so that nobody really gets to own the

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.650 
so that nobody really gets to own the
Moon<00:06:05.860> or<00:06:06.220> Mars<00:06:06.280> so<00:06:07.030> there<00:06:07.150> all<00:06:07.330> of<00:06:07.360> these

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:07.660 
Moon or Mars so there all of these

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.510 
Moon or Mars so there all of these
interesting<00:06:08.380> questions<00:06:08.860> and<00:06:09.070> clinical
