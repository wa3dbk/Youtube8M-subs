00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.140
 I come to say what I thought 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:29.580
 my 2013 and everything that I have lived in the no 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:32.040
 good I started 2013 with a channel 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.980
 1500 subscribers eager 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.280
 I started 2013 the truth and it ended with still 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.010
 more desire, I do not know, they do not take away 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.780
 you never want to make videos of 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:46.079
 talk to you on twitter 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:50.670
 youtube is something and I do not know what I have 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.350
 already as a greater hob and come down already and even 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.510
 more than football because it is at stake 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.020
 in a team also worth of football 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.090
 and the truth that youtube did not take it anymore 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.379
 already as something form very form 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.000
 part of my whole life had everything is 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.050
 good according to a video every three days but 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.200
 not now 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.000

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.450
 September 17 a day before a 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.670
 event that changed my channel so much 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.720
