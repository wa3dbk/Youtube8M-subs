00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.039 
motion quilting and it's just too fast
it's<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:34.260> really<00:00:34.800> rips<00:00:35.100> in<00:00:35.550> it's<00:00:35.790> not<00:00:36.420> fun<00:00:36.720> so

industrial machine

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.439 
industrial machine
I<00:00:48.409> love<00:00:49.409> the<00:00:49.589> machine<00:00:50.010> but<00:00:50.729> it's<00:00:50.909> just<00:00:51.119> too

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
I love the machine but it's just too

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:58.640 
I love the machine but it's just too
hard<00:00:51.890> to<00:00:52.890> operate<00:00:53.280> slowly<00:00:56.659> just<00:00:57.659> a<00:00:57.960> big<00:00:58.260> motion

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:58.650 
hard to operate slowly just a big motion

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.109 
hard to operate slowly just a big motion
well<00:00:58.949> with<00:00:59.220> it<00:01:00.530> we're<00:01:01.530> going<00:01:02.159> to<00:01:02.339> attempt<00:01:02.970> it

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:03.119 
well with it we're going to attempt it

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:07.690 
well with it we're going to attempt it
soon<00:01:03.949> it's<00:01:04.949> run<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.369> servo<00:01:05.970> motor<00:01:06.000> on<00:01:06.810> it

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
soon it's run a servo motor on it

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.310 
soon it's run a servo motor on it
that's<00:01:08.700> what<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.090> plan<00:01:09.359> is<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.659> we've<00:01:10.020> bought

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
that's what the plan is and we've bought

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.480 
that's what the plan is and we've bought
one<00:01:10.649> which<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.700> over<00:01:12.030> here<00:01:12.829> and<00:01:13.829> we're<00:01:14.250> going

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
one which is over here and we're going

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.410 
one which is over here and we're going
to<00:01:14.579> try<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.880> put<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.240> on<00:01:16.820> now<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.880> first<00:01:18.210> thing

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
to try to put it on now the first thing

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.989 
to try to put it on now the first thing
we'll<00:01:18.630> disconnect<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.289> power<00:01:19.500> I'll<00:01:20.399> get<00:01:20.729> back

00:01:20.989 --> 00:01:20.999 
we'll disconnect the power I'll get back

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:53.230 
we'll disconnect the power I'll get back
to<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.350> there<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.499> is<00:01:22.999> the<00:01:23.999> servo<00:01:25.490> conversion

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.650 

works<00:01:54.240> very<00:01:54.390> well<00:01:54.690> I<00:01:55.850> broke<00:01:56.850> this<00:01:57.030> Friday<00:01:57.360> if

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
works very well I broke this Friday if

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.980 
works very well I broke this Friday if
you<00:01:57.810> see<00:01:58.640> you<00:01:59.640> can<00:01:59.850> see<00:02:00.120> that<00:02:00.300> it<00:02:00.420> works<00:02:00.660> very

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
you see you can see that it works very

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.010 
you see you can see that it works very
well

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.810 

that's<00:02:07.020> about<00:02:07.290> as<00:02:07.500> slow<00:02:07.860> as<00:02:08.070> I<00:02:08.250> can<00:02:08.280> get<00:02:08.640> it

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
that's about as slow as I can get it

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.609 
that's about as slow as I can get it
maybe<00:02:09.060> somebody<00:02:09.390> with<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.720> finer<00:02:10.020> foot<00:02:10.410> could

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
maybe somebody with a finer foot could

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:44.530 
maybe somebody with a finer foot could
do<00:02:10.740> better<00:02:12.080> their<00:02:13.080> job<00:02:13.830> complete

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.010 

there<00:02:45.540> you<00:02:45.720> have<00:02:45.900> it<00:02:46.140> a<00:02:46.350> servomotor<00:02:47.340> hook<00:02:47.640> down

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
there you have it a servomotor hook down

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.690 
there you have it a servomotor hook down
3115<00:02:50.569> could<00:02:51.569> you<00:02:51.890> if<00:02:52.890> you<00:02:53.010> got<00:02:53.160> a<00:02:53.220> minute<00:02:53.400> you

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
3115 could you if you got a minute you

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:00.630 
3115 could you if you got a minute you
step<00:02:54.030> down<00:02:54.060> on<00:02:54.450> that

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.700 

you
