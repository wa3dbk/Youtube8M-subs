00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:02.200 

the<00:01:00.649> first<00:01:00.920> fundamental<00:01:01.309> in<00:01:01.850> legato

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
the first fundamental in legato

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.970 
the first fundamental in legato
technique<00:01:02.540> is<00:01:02.989> to<00:01:03.110> keep<00:01:03.230> your<00:01:03.380> fingers<00:01:03.739> close

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
technique is to keep your fingers close

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.370 
technique is to keep your fingers close
to<00:01:04.100> the<00:01:04.280> fretboard<00:01:04.670> this<00:01:05.479> accomplishes<00:01:06.170> three

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
to the fretboard this accomplishes three

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.430 
to the fretboard this accomplishes three
major<00:01:06.710> things<00:01:07.570> the<00:01:08.570> first<00:01:08.810> thing<00:01:09.020> is<00:01:09.409> that

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
major things the first thing is that

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.830 
major things the first thing is that
helps<00:01:09.860> your<00:01:09.979> tone<00:01:10.310> if<00:01:10.670> your<00:01:11.030> fingers<00:01:11.510> are<00:01:11.540> very

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
helps your tone if your fingers are very

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.390 
helps your tone if your fingers are very
far<00:01:12.110> off<00:01:12.350> the<00:01:12.530> fretboard<00:01:12.830> when<00:01:13.280> you're

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
far off the fretboard when you're

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.760 
far off the fretboard when you're
playing<00:01:13.729> and<00:01:14.060> they<00:01:14.570> have<00:01:14.869> all<00:01:15.080> this<00:01:15.260> time<00:01:15.590> to

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
playing and they have all this time to

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.800 
playing and they have all this time to
come<00:01:15.950> down<00:01:15.979> from<00:01:16.550> being<00:01:16.700> very<00:01:16.970> high<00:01:17.240> off<00:01:17.450> the

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
come down from being very high off the

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.260 
come down from being very high off the
neck<00:01:18.350> you<00:01:18.920> gain<00:01:19.130> a<00:01:19.160> lot<00:01:19.369> of<00:01:19.490> momentum<00:01:19.790> with<00:01:20.180> the

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
neck you gain a lot of momentum with the

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.990 
neck you gain a lot of momentum with the
finger<00:01:20.630> that<00:01:21.020> momentum<00:01:21.740> often<00:01:22.280> causes<00:01:22.820> you<00:01:22.970> to

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
finger that momentum often causes you to

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.480 
finger that momentum often causes you to
play<00:01:23.300> too<00:01:23.360> hard<00:01:23.720> and<00:01:24.369> when<00:01:25.369> you're

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
play too hard and when you're

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.940 
play too hard and when you're
overplaying<00:01:25.850> and<00:01:26.479> pressing<00:01:26.900> too<00:01:27.080> hard<00:01:27.110> this

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
overplaying and pressing too hard this

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.070 
overplaying and pressing too hard this
will<00:01:28.190> often<00:01:28.430> cause<00:01:28.820> the<00:01:29.030> note<00:01:29.240> to<00:01:29.479> kind<00:01:29.990> of

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
will often cause the note to kind of

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.880 
will often cause the note to kind of
slap<00:01:30.500> or<00:01:31.270> kind<00:01:32.270> of<00:01:32.330> over<00:01:32.660> compress<00:01:33.170> so<00:01:33.770> the

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
slap or kind of over compress so the

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.080 
slap or kind of over compress so the
note<00:01:34.130> won't<00:01:34.399> ring<00:01:34.670> is<00:01:34.850> true<00:01:35.619> so<00:01:37.030> keeping<00:01:38.030> your

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
note won't ring is true so keeping your

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.580 
note won't ring is true so keeping your
fingers<00:01:38.420> close<00:01:38.660> to<00:01:38.810> the<00:01:38.930> fret<00:01:39.140> board<00:01:39.170> also

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
fingers close to the fret board also

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.650 
fingers close to the fret board also
accomplishes<00:01:40.460> the<00:01:40.550> second<00:01:40.970> thing<00:01:41.210> which<00:01:41.479> is

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
accomplishes the second thing which is

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.680 
accomplishes the second thing which is
your<00:01:41.780> intonation<00:01:42.140> if<00:01:42.770> your<00:01:43.580> your<00:01:44.210> fingers<00:01:44.570> are

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
your intonation if your your fingers are

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.260 
your intonation if your your fingers are
too<00:01:44.810> far<00:01:45.080> away<00:01:45.320> from<00:01:45.500> the<00:01:45.830> neck<00:01:46.270> sometimes

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
too far away from the neck sometimes

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.109 
too far away from the neck sometimes
again<00:01:47.929> this<00:01:48.289> momentum<00:01:49.039> of<00:01:49.310> the<00:01:49.729> fingers

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
again this momentum of the fingers

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:51.969 
again this momentum of the fingers
coming<00:01:50.479> down<00:01:50.690> under<00:01:50.899> the<00:01:51.140> string<00:01:51.410> really<00:01:51.619> hard

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
coming down under the string really hard

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:53.859 
coming down under the string really hard
will<00:01:52.160> actually<00:01:52.610> push<00:01:52.910> the<00:01:53.060> string<00:01:53.390> slightly

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
will actually push the string slightly

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.529 
will actually push the string slightly
out<00:01:54.020> of<00:01:54.050> tune<00:01:54.340> so<00:01:55.340> you<00:01:55.429> may<00:01:55.789> start<00:01:55.850> to<00:01:56.179> run<00:01:56.390> into

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
out of tune so you may start to run into

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:59.290 
out of tune so you may start to run into
intonation<00:01:57.080> problems<00:01:57.850> with<00:01:58.850> your<00:01:58.970> playing

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
intonation problems with your playing

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.999 
intonation problems with your playing
and<00:01:59.600> not<00:01:59.840> realize<00:02:00.229> while<00:02:00.470> you're<00:02:00.619> playing<00:02:00.770> out

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
and not realize while you're playing out

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:02.740 
and not realize while you're playing out
of<00:02:01.070> tune<00:02:01.190> but<00:02:01.820> if<00:02:01.970> you<00:02:02.060> just<00:02:02.240> take<00:02:02.390> a<00:02:02.420> look<00:02:02.630> at

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
of tune but if you just take a look at

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.690 
of tune but if you just take a look at
your<00:02:02.869> technique<00:02:03.439> you<00:02:03.950> might<00:02:04.159> find<00:02:04.369> that<00:02:04.579> your

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
your technique you might find that your

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.580 
your technique you might find that your
fingers<00:02:05.030> are<00:02:05.180> coming<00:02:05.960> way<00:02:06.110> off<00:02:06.259> of<00:02:06.439> the

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
fingers are coming way off of the

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:07.960 
fingers are coming way off of the
fretboard<00:02:06.890> they're<00:02:07.280> not<00:02:07.400> close<00:02:07.670> enough<00:02:07.909> to

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
fretboard they're not close enough to

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.370 
fretboard they're not close enough to
the<00:02:08.179> fretboard<00:02:08.450> causing<00:02:09.140> you<00:02:09.229> to<00:02:09.350> have

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
the fretboard causing you to have

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.539 
the fretboard causing you to have
intonation<00:02:09.979> problems<00:02:11.470> the<00:02:12.470> next<00:02:12.950> thing<00:02:13.250> that

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:13.549 
intonation problems the next thing that

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:17.800 
intonation problems the next thing that
it<00:02:13.790> helps<00:02:14.060> with<00:02:14.120> is<00:02:15.010> your<00:02:16.010> speed<00:02:16.370> now<00:02:17.329> if<00:02:17.660> your

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
it helps with is your speed now if your

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.680 
it helps with is your speed now if your
fingers<00:02:18.110> are<00:02:18.230> close<00:02:18.620> to<00:02:18.829> the<00:02:18.950> guitar<00:02:19.280> neck

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
fingers are close to the guitar neck

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.870 
fingers are close to the guitar neck
while<00:02:20.690> you're<00:02:20.840> playing<00:02:21.400> and<00:02:22.400> then<00:02:22.519> they're

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
while you're playing and then they're

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.910 
while you're playing and then they're
not<00:02:23.150> coming<00:02:23.540> way<00:02:23.690> off<00:02:23.840> that<00:02:23.870> fretboard<00:02:24.650> you

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
not coming way off that fretboard you

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.979 
not coming way off that fretboard you
can<00:02:25.160> you<00:02:25.610> can<00:02:25.760> play<00:02:25.880> faster<00:02:26.360> tempos<00:02:26.720> more

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
can you can play faster tempos more

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.140 
can you can play faster tempos more
easily<00:02:27.500> like<00:02:27.739> it's<00:02:28.010> demonstrated<00:02:28.700> in<00:02:28.880> this

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
easily like it's demonstrated in this

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.110 
easily like it's demonstrated in this
video<00:02:29.540> at<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:29.900> beginning<00:02:30.019> of<00:02:30.350> the<00:02:30.470> lesson

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
video at the beginning of the lesson

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.080 
video at the beginning of the lesson
faster<00:02:32.120> tempos<00:02:32.540> require<00:02:33.170> that<00:02:34.100> your<00:02:34.640> fingers

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
faster tempos require that your fingers

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.660 
faster tempos require that your fingers
have<00:02:35.440> less<00:02:36.440> movement<00:02:36.739> because<00:02:37.250> they<00:02:37.370> have<00:02:37.519> to

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
have less movement because they have to

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.090 
have less movement because they have to
do<00:02:37.820> very<00:02:38.060> very<00:02:38.360> quick<00:02:38.720> specific<00:02:39.440> things<00:02:39.769> in

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
do very very quick specific things in

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.130 
do very very quick specific things in
the<00:02:40.190> moment<00:02:40.579> so<00:02:40.700> if<00:02:41.209> your<00:02:41.360> fingers<00:02:41.720> are<00:02:41.840> really

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
the moment so if your fingers are really

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.220 
the moment so if your fingers are really
high<00:02:42.440> off<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:42.739> fretboard<00:02:43.810> there's<00:02:44.810> just<00:02:45.049> no

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
high off the fretboard there's just no

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.289 
high off the fretboard there's just no
time<00:02:45.470> to<00:02:45.799> play<00:02:45.980> fast<00:02:46.370> tempos<00:02:46.850> you'll<00:02:47.060> fall

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
time to play fast tempos you'll fall

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.600 
time to play fast tempos you'll fall
behind<00:02:47.480> in<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:47.930> tempo<00:02:48.350> or<00:02:48.799> you'll<00:02:49.190> just<00:02:49.400> start

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
behind in the tempo or you'll just start

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.810 
behind in the tempo or you'll just start
to<00:02:49.850> feel<00:02:50.180> fatigued<00:02:50.600> with<00:02:50.810> your<00:02:50.870> hands<00:02:51.820> which

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
to feel fatigued with your hands which

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.319 
to feel fatigued with your hands which
will<00:02:53.269> ultimately<00:02:53.600> make<00:02:54.340> fast<00:02:55.340> tempos<00:02:55.730> nearly

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
will ultimately make fast tempos nearly

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:22.119 
will ultimately make fast tempos nearly
impossible

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:22.129 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:24.530 

the<00:03:23.129> second<00:03:23.549> fundamental<00:03:24.150> and<00:03:24.269> legato

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
the second fundamental and legato

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.149 
the second fundamental and legato
technique<00:03:24.840> is<00:03:25.230> to<00:03:25.319> have<00:03:25.409> a<00:03:25.439> quick<00:03:25.769> light

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 
technique is to have a quick light

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:29.330 
technique is to have a quick light
motion<00:03:26.549> when<00:03:26.939> fretting<00:03:27.359> the<00:03:27.450> notes<00:03:27.659> now<00:03:28.620> what

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
motion when fretting the notes now what

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.220 
motion when fretting the notes now what
we're<00:03:29.489> trying<00:03:29.700> to<00:03:29.819> achieve<00:03:30.030> legato<00:03:30.930> technique

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
we're trying to achieve legato technique

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.839 
we're trying to achieve legato technique
is<00:03:31.680> long<00:03:32.040> tones<00:03:32.609> that<00:03:33.450> have<00:03:33.780> an<00:03:34.230> even<00:03:34.769> sound<00:03:35.159> so

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
is long tones that have an even sound so

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.729 
is long tones that have an even sound so
in<00:03:36.090> order<00:03:36.209> to<00:03:36.329> achieve<00:03:36.750> an<00:03:36.870> even<00:03:37.109> sound<00:03:37.530> we

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
in order to achieve an even sound we

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.470 
in order to achieve an even sound we
need<00:03:37.920> to<00:03:38.010> have<00:03:38.159> an<00:03:38.280> even<00:03:38.489> balance<00:03:38.879> in<00:03:39.359> the

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
need to have an even balance in the

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.720 
need to have an even balance in the
volume<00:03:39.959> between<00:03:40.319> the<00:03:40.500> notes<00:03:40.709> so<00:03:41.310> some<00:03:41.519> of<00:03:41.639> the

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
volume between the notes so some of the

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.640 
volume between the notes so some of the
notes<00:03:41.909> will<00:03:42.209> obviously<00:03:42.599> be<00:03:42.930> picked<00:03:43.230> some<00:03:43.530> of

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
notes will obviously be picked some of

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.170 
notes will obviously be picked some of
the<00:03:43.680> notes<00:03:43.920> will<00:03:44.069> be<00:03:44.099> hammered<00:03:44.579> on<00:03:44.700> some<00:03:45.060> of

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
the notes will be hammered on some of

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.479 
the notes will be hammered on some of
the<00:03:45.299> notes<00:03:45.510> will<00:03:45.719> be<00:03:45.750> pulled<00:03:46.379> off<00:03:46.590> but<00:03:47.340> the

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
the notes will be pulled off but the

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.250 
the notes will be pulled off but the
it's<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:47.909> quick<00:03:48.239> motion<00:03:48.719> that<00:03:48.870> helps<00:03:49.170> you

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
it's the quick motion that helps you

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.250 
it's the quick motion that helps you
achieve<00:03:49.879> balance<00:03:50.879> with<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.299> volumes<00:03:51.840> of<00:03:52.109> the

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
achieve balance with the volumes of the

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.830 
achieve balance with the volumes of the
notes<00:03:52.530> so<00:03:53.280> for<00:03:53.549> example<00:03:56.389> it's<00:03:57.389> a<00:03:57.419> very<00:03:57.659> quick

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
notes so for example it's a very quick

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:12.940 
notes so for example it's a very quick
motion<00:03:58.349> and<00:03:58.590> with<00:03:58.799> my<00:03:58.950> finger

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.470 

the<00:04:13.950> quick<00:04:14.400> motion<00:04:14.879> onto<00:04:15.120> the<00:04:15.209> fretboard

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
the quick motion onto the fretboard

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.330 
the quick motion onto the fretboard
while<00:04:16.049> staying<00:04:16.440> close<00:04:16.739> to<00:04:16.769> the<00:04:16.979> fret<00:04:17.310> board

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
while staying close to the fret board

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.150 
while staying close to the fret board
allows<00:04:18.180> me<00:04:18.389> to<00:04:18.479> achieve<00:04:18.600> even<00:04:19.049> balance<00:04:19.949> with

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
allows me to achieve even balance with

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.330 
allows me to achieve even balance with
the<00:04:20.280> volume<00:04:20.639> of<00:04:20.790> each<00:04:20.940> note

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.610 

the<00:04:26.270> third<00:04:26.510> fundamental<00:04:26.750> and<00:04:27.290> legato

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
the third fundamental and legato

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.980 
the third fundamental and legato
technique<00:04:27.860> is<00:04:28.250> to<00:04:28.400> focus<00:04:28.940> on<00:04:29.150> the<00:04:29.389> length<00:04:29.690> of

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
technique is to focus on the length of

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.379 
technique is to focus on the length of
the<00:04:30.110> note<00:04:30.560> as<00:04:30.800> you're<00:04:31.040> playing<00:04:31.310> this<00:04:32.120> really

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
the note as you're playing this really

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:35.500 
the note as you're playing this really
requires<00:04:32.810> slow<00:04:33.500> practice<00:04:34.310> as<00:04:34.550> mentioned<00:04:35.450> at

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
requires slow practice as mentioned at

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.909 
requires slow practice as mentioned at
the<00:04:35.570> beginning<00:04:35.720> of<00:04:36.110> the<00:04:36.230> lesson<00:04:36.440> these<00:04:36.740> are

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
the beginning of the lesson these are

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:40.030 
the beginning of the lesson these are
fundamentals<00:04:37.790> these<00:04:38.030> are<00:04:38.180> basics<00:04:38.960> so<00:04:39.530> basics

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
fundamentals these are basics so basics

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.490 
fundamentals these are basics so basics
always<00:04:40.460> require<00:04:40.910> very<00:04:41.419> slow<00:04:41.870> deliberate

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
always require very slow deliberate

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.040 
always require very slow deliberate
practice<00:04:42.860> I<00:04:43.400> find<00:04:44.180> that<00:04:44.300> if<00:04:44.450> you<00:04:44.570> work<00:04:44.780> on<00:04:44.930> the

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
practice I find that if you work on the

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
practice I find that if you work on the
basics<00:04:45.620> the<00:04:46.460> real<00:04:46.760> fundamentals<00:04:47.419> of<00:04:47.540> playing

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
basics the real fundamentals of playing

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.460 
basics the real fundamentals of playing
you<00:04:49.070> know<00:04:49.220> if<00:04:49.520> you<00:04:49.760> work<00:04:49.940> on<00:04:50.060> them<00:04:50.210> very<00:04:50.470> hard

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
you know if you work on them very hard

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.390 
you know if you work on them very hard
and<00:04:51.889> you<00:04:52.010> work<00:04:52.160> on<00:04:52.280> the<00:04:52.400> very<00:04:52.610> slow<00:04:53.260> ultimately

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
and you work on the very slow ultimately

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.980 
and you work on the very slow ultimately
these<00:04:55.400> things<00:04:55.700> will<00:04:55.850> have<00:04:56.000> the<00:04:56.150> most<00:04:56.450> effect

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
these things will have the most effect

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.970 
these things will have the most effect
on<00:04:57.200> your<00:04:57.320> playing<00:04:57.650> so<00:04:58.460> with<00:04:59.060> legato<00:04:59.450> technique

00:04:59.970 --> 00:04:59.980 
on your playing so with legato technique

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.860 
on your playing so with legato technique
you<00:05:00.980> want<00:05:01.130> to<00:05:01.280> focus<00:05:01.490> on<00:05:01.850> the<00:05:02.120> length<00:05:02.450> of<00:05:02.720> the

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
you want to focus on the length of the

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.860 
you want to focus on the length of the
note<00:05:03.110> because<00:05:03.830> we're<00:05:04.190> we're<00:05:04.880> focusing<00:05:05.450> on<00:05:05.630> the

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
note because we're we're focusing on the

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.159 
note because we're we're focusing on the
term<00:05:06.080> legato<00:05:06.620> which<00:05:07.070> means<00:05:07.310> longer<00:05:07.790> tones<00:05:08.390> so

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
term legato which means longer tones so

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:11.440 
term legato which means longer tones so
legato<00:05:09.860> doesn't<00:05:10.490> just<00:05:10.669> mean<00:05:10.820> hammer-ons<00:05:11.300> and

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
legato doesn't just mean hammer-ons and

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:12.940 
legato doesn't just mean hammer-ons and
pull-offs<00:05:11.540> a<00:05:12.050> lot<00:05:12.200> of<00:05:12.320> times<00:05:12.530> the<00:05:12.650> guitar

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
pull-offs a lot of times the guitar

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.070 
pull-offs a lot of times the guitar
players<00:05:13.220> refer<00:05:13.640> to<00:05:13.850> legato<00:05:14.330> technique<00:05:14.630> is

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
players refer to legato technique is

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.250 
players refer to legato technique is
just<00:05:15.290> hammer-ons<00:05:16.220> and<00:05:16.370> pull-offs<00:05:16.460> in<00:05:17.260> my

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
just hammer-ons and pull-offs in my

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.310 
just hammer-ons and pull-offs in my
opinion<00:05:18.620> that's<00:05:18.770> not<00:05:18.890> really<00:05:19.460> what<00:05:19.640> it<00:05:19.790> is<00:05:20.030> a

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
opinion that's not really what it is a

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.860 
opinion that's not really what it is a
legato<00:05:21.320> sound<00:05:21.470> is<00:05:22.220> long<00:05:22.729> sustained<00:05:23.450> notes

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
legato sound is long sustained notes

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.710 
legato sound is long sustained notes
with<00:05:24.310> very<00:05:25.310> small<00:05:25.700> spaces<00:05:26.030> in<00:05:26.360> between<00:05:26.389> the

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
with very small spaces in between the

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.100 
with very small spaces in between the
notes<00:05:26.990> so<00:05:27.800> if<00:05:27.860> we're<00:05:28.010> trying<00:05:28.190> to<00:05:28.310> get<00:05:28.580> to<00:05:29.110> the

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
notes so if we're trying to get to the

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.770 
notes so if we're trying to get to the
fundamentals<00:05:31.100> of<00:05:31.310> this<00:05:31.490> we<00:05:31.850> need<00:05:32.120> to<00:05:32.330> we<00:05:32.630> need

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
fundamentals of this we need to we need

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.780 
fundamentals of this we need to we need
to<00:05:32.900> really<00:05:33.200> focus<00:05:33.500> on<00:05:33.860> the<00:05:34.100> length<00:05:34.400> of<00:05:34.610> each

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:34.790 
to really focus on the length of each

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:43.570 
to really focus on the length of each
note<00:05:35.210> so<00:05:35.840> I<00:05:35.870> practice<00:05:36.680> things<00:05:37.280> like<00:05:37.400> this<00:05:42.580> and

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
note so I practice things like this and

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.029 
note so I practice things like this and
I'm<00:05:43.700> really<00:05:43.970> listening<00:05:44.330> to<00:05:44.660> the<00:05:45.260> sound<00:05:45.890> that

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:46.039 
I'm really listening to the sound that

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:48.219 
I'm really listening to the sound that
I'm<00:05:46.280> making<00:05:46.669> I'm<00:05:46.820> really<00:05:47.300> really<00:05:47.510> focusing<00:05:48.110> on

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:48.229 
I'm making I'm really really focusing on

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:50.440 
I'm making I'm really really focusing on
the<00:05:48.350> sound<00:05:48.620> I'm<00:05:48.860> not<00:05:49.070> like<00:05:49.820> thinking<00:05:50.240> about

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.450 
the sound I'm not like thinking about

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:51.909 
the sound I'm not like thinking about
something<00:05:50.720> else<00:05:51.020> while<00:05:51.320> I'm<00:05:51.440> playing<00:05:51.740> I'm

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:51.919 
something else while I'm playing I'm

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:54.159 
something else while I'm playing I'm
really<00:05:52.160> focused<00:05:52.970> on<00:05:53.180> the<00:05:53.419> instrument<00:05:53.990> I'm

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:54.169 
really focused on the instrument I'm

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:57.310 
really focused on the instrument I'm
focused<00:05:54.800> on<00:05:54.979> my<00:05:55.190> tone<00:05:55.520> I'm<00:05:56.210> really<00:05:56.510> focusing

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:57.320 
focused on my tone I'm really focusing

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.800 
focused on my tone I'm really focusing
on<00:05:57.560> my<00:05:57.770> technique<00:05:58.340> and<00:05:58.550> the<00:05:58.910> sound<00:05:59.300> that<00:05:59.690> I'm

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810 
on my technique and the sound that I'm

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:23.740 
on my technique and the sound that I'm
making

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:23.750 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.500 

if<00:06:24.750> you<00:06:25.350> practice<00:06:25.800> slowly<00:06:26.220> like<00:06:26.580> this<00:06:26.610> and<00:06:27.120> you

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:27.510 
if you practice slowly like this and you

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.510 
if you practice slowly like this and you
really<00:06:27.780> focus<00:06:28.410> on<00:06:28.650> the<00:06:28.860> sound<00:06:29.160> that<00:06:29.340> you're

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 
really focus on the sound that you're

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.550 
really focus on the sound that you're
making<00:06:29.730> by<00:06:30.180> ear<00:06:30.600> and<00:06:30.900> you<00:06:30.960> focus<00:06:31.200> on<00:06:31.410> your

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 
making by ear and you focus on your

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.920 
making by ear and you focus on your
technique<00:06:31.770> but<00:06:32.280> you<00:06:32.310> play<00:06:32.580> slowly<00:06:33.090> enough<00:06:33.660> to

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:33.930 
technique but you play slowly enough to

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.590 
technique but you play slowly enough to
really<00:06:34.290> focus<00:06:34.710> on<00:06:34.860> all<00:06:35.070> the<00:06:35.280> details<00:06:35.600> this

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:36.600 
really focus on all the details this

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.400 
really focus on all the details this
will<00:06:36.810> eventually<00:06:37.350> find<00:06:38.160> its<00:06:38.400> way<00:06:38.730> into

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:39.410 
will eventually find its way into

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:42.440 
will eventually find its way into
phrases<00:06:40.410> that<00:06:40.770> are<00:06:40.830> faster<00:06:41.460> for<00:06:41.669> you<00:06:41.850> so<00:06:42.390> if

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:42.450 
phrases that are faster for you so if

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.780 
phrases that are faster for you so if
you<00:06:42.570> start<00:06:42.930> slow<00:06:43.320> then<00:06:43.650> gradually<00:06:44.220> build<00:06:44.520> up

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:44.790 
you start slow then gradually build up

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:47.300 
you start slow then gradually build up
to<00:06:44.970> faster<00:06:45.480> phrases<00:06:46.050> but<00:06:46.320> still<00:06:46.710> have<00:06:46.980> all<00:06:47.280> of

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:47.310 
to faster phrases but still have all of

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:50.060 
to faster phrases but still have all of
these<00:06:47.610> fundamental<00:06:48.060> techniques<00:06:48.840> intact<00:06:49.350> your

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:50.070 
these fundamental techniques intact your

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.630 
these fundamental techniques intact your
legato<00:06:50.550> playing<00:06:50.669> will<00:06:51.210> improve
