about<00:00:05.759> setting<00:00:06.240> the<00:00:06.450> program<00:00:06.870> in<00:00:07.020> however<00:00:07.500> I

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
about setting the program in however I

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.790 
about setting the program in however I
want<00:00:08.130> to<00:00:08.280> set<00:00:08.490> it<00:00:08.670> I<00:00:08.849> can<00:00:09.480> have<00:00:09.690> one<00:00:10.019> program<00:00:10.620> at

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
want to set it I can have one program at

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.980 
want to set it I can have one program at
a<00:00:10.860> lower<00:00:11.370> speed<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:12.059> have<00:00:12.360> another<00:00:12.660> program

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
a lower speed and have another program

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.470 
a lower speed and have another program
at<00:00:13.230> a<00:00:13.320> faster<00:00:13.860> more<00:00:14.340> exciting<00:00:14.940> speed<00:00:15.179> for<00:00:15.389> that

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
at a faster more exciting speed for that

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.019 
at a faster more exciting speed for that
horse<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:16.350> when<00:00:16.470> I<00:00:16.500> use<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:17.010> memory<00:00:17.369> system

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
horse and when I use the memory system

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.679 
horse and when I use the memory system
I<00:00:18.060> can<00:00:18.750> set<00:00:19.080> four<00:00:19.710> different<00:00:20.340> programs<00:00:20.689> some

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
I can set four different programs some

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.560 
I can set four different programs some
fast<00:00:22.020> some<00:00:22.410> slow<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.039> no<00:00:23.430> matter<00:00:23.640> how<00:00:23.970> fast<00:00:24.300> or

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
fast some slow and no matter how fast or

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.720 
fast some slow and no matter how fast or
slow<00:00:24.630> I<00:00:24.840> go<00:00:25.140> in<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.410> manual<00:00:25.859> mode<00:00:26.039> those

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
slow I go in the manual mode those

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.540 
slow I go in the manual mode those
systems<00:00:27.269> will<00:00:27.449> hold<00:00:27.779> their<00:00:28.080> speed<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.740> do<00:00:29.369> the

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
systems will hold their speed and do the

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.519 
systems will hold their speed and do the
speed<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:30.029> I<00:00:30.060> actually<00:00:30.510> programmed<00:00:30.990> into<00:00:31.289> it

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
speed that I actually programmed into it

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.549 
speed that I actually programmed into it
now<00:00:32.340> it's<00:00:32.550> in<00:00:32.730> memory<00:00:33.000> one<00:00:33.450> all<00:00:33.840> I<00:00:33.899> have<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.410> do

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
now it's in memory one all I have to do

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.430 
now it's in memory one all I have to do
is<00:00:34.680> press<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.280> green<00:00:35.550> play<00:00:36.270> button<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.870> we're

ready<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.829> go<00:00:38.010> now<00:00:39.800> it's<00:00:40.800> going<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.040> do<00:00:41.430> the

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
ready to go now it's going to do the

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.830 
ready to go now it's going to do the
exact<00:00:42.059> program

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
exact program

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.700

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
I just set in you can set these programs

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.369 
I just set in you can set these programs
and<00:00:46.890> these<00:00:46.980> programs<00:00:47.039> will<00:00:47.789> stay<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.510> the

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
and these programs will stay in the

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.160 
and these programs will stay in the
system<00:00:49.940> for<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.059> until<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:51.629> want<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.899> change

other<00:02:27.100> times<00:02:27.490> when<00:02:27.820> I'm<00:02:27.940> working<00:02:27.970> a<00:02:28.450> cow<00:02:28.630> and<00:02:28.960> I

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
other times when I'm working a cow and I

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.260 
other times when I'm working a cow and I
can't<00:02:29.650> get<00:02:29.830> the<00:02:29.950> cow<00:02:30.130> to<00:02:30.190> do<00:02:30.520> what<00:02:30.700> I<00:02:30.790> want<00:02:31.060> to

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
can't get the cow to do what I want to

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.120 
can't get the cow to do what I want to
get<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.540> horse<00:02:31.750> to<00:02:31.900> perform<00:02:32.290> properly<00:02:32.860> and<00:02:33.070> to

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
get the horse to perform properly and to

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.390 
get the horse to perform properly and to
train<00:02:33.490> them<00:02:33.760> to<00:02:33.970> do<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.660> right<00:02:34.900> thing<00:02:35.320> after<00:02:35.890> I

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
train them to do the right thing after I

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.370 
train them to do the right thing after I
work<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:36.880> cow<00:02:37.090> then<00:02:37.570> I'll<00:02:37.750> come<00:02:38.020> work<00:02:38.200> the

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
work the cow then I'll come work the

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.530 
work the cow then I'll come work the
mechanical<00:02:38.950> cow<00:02:39.070> that<00:02:39.760> way<00:02:40.000> I've<00:02:40.180> really

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
mechanical cow that way I've really

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:48.600 
mechanical cow that way I've really
trained<00:02:40.870> a<00:02:40.990> great<00:02:41.200> horse

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.990 

the<00:02:49.270> caltrak<00:02:49.840> allows<00:02:50.200> me<00:02:50.500> to<00:02:50.770> wait<00:02:51.010> draw<00:02:51.850> it

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
the caltrak allows me to wait draw it

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.290 
the caltrak allows me to wait draw it
back<00:02:52.240> and<00:02:52.750> double-click<00:02:53.380> and<00:02:53.620> speed<00:02:53.890> it<00:02:54.040> up

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
back and double-click and speed it up

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.840 
back and double-click and speed it up
that<00:02:55.300> lets<00:02:55.540> my<00:02:55.720> horse<00:02:55.990> learn<00:02:56.260> to<00:02:56.770> come<00:02:56.980> slow

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
that lets my horse learn to come slow

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.910 
that lets my horse learn to come slow
through<00:02:58.360> that<00:02:58.540> turn<00:02:58.840> and<00:02:59.080> what<00:02:59.230> we<00:02:59.320> call<00:02:59.560> draw

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
through that turn and what we call draw

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.250 
through that turn and what we call draw
and<00:03:00.310> then<00:03:00.700> as<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.060> cow<00:03:01.240> approaches<00:03:01.750> I<00:03:01.840> speed

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
and then as the cow approaches I speed

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.080 
and then as the cow approaches I speed
it<00:03:02.410> up<00:03:02.560> speed<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.220> horse<00:03:03.430> up<00:03:03.640> through<00:03:03.880> that

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
it up speed the horse up through that

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.180 
it up speed the horse up through that
turn<00:03:06.360> draw<00:03:07.360> speed<00:03:08.140> it<00:03:08.260> out<00:03:08.440> come<00:03:08.800> through<00:03:09.010> that

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
turn draw speed it out come through that

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.820 
turn draw speed it out come through that
turn<00:03:09.690> then<00:03:10.690> I<00:03:10.720> can<00:03:11.050> bring<00:03:11.200> it<00:03:11.320> back<00:03:11.470> to<00:03:11.650> real

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
turn then I can bring it back to real

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.520 
turn then I can bring it back to real
slow<00:03:12.130> again<00:03:12.310> and<00:03:12.670> stand<00:03:12.940> for<00:03:13.210> a<00:03:13.240> second<00:03:13.660> get<00:03:14.380> my

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
slow again and stand for a second get my

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.200 
slow again and stand for a second get my
horse<00:03:14.770> in<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:15.070> right<00:03:15.250> form<00:03:15.580> that<00:03:15.850> I<00:03:15.940> want<00:03:16.120> him

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
horse in the right form that I want him

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.260 
horse in the right form that I want him
in<00:03:16.980> going<00:03:17.980> back<00:03:18.250> let<00:03:18.610> him<00:03:18.730> come<00:03:18.880> through<00:03:18.940> that

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
in going back let him come through that

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.140 
in going back let him come through that
turn<00:03:19.540> back<00:03:20.410> to<00:03:20.650> slow<00:03:20.890> mode<00:03:21.160> so<00:03:21.820> the<00:03:21.940> horse

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
turn back to slow mode so the horse

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.720 
turn back to slow mode so the horse
learns<00:03:22.450> to<00:03:22.900> speed<00:03:23.200> up<00:03:23.410> and<00:03:23.590> slow<00:03:23.890> down<00:03:24.400> with

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
learns to speed up and slow down with

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.820 
learns to speed up and slow down with
the<00:03:24.940> cow<00:03:25.120> actually<00:03:25.750> reading<00:03:26.440> that<00:03:26.620> cow

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
the cow actually reading that cow

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.820 
the cow actually reading that cow
through<00:03:27.130> that<00:03:27.340> turn<00:03:27.610> and<00:03:28.330> you<00:03:29.260> can<00:03:29.290> go<00:03:29.530> short

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
through that turn and you can go short

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.590 
through that turn and you can go short
get<00:03:30.430> that<00:03:30.610> horse<00:03:30.850> where<00:03:31.060> he<00:03:31.120> doesn't<00:03:31.330> blow

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
get that horse where he doesn't blow

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:38.190 
get that horse where he doesn't blow
through<00:03:31.870> that<00:03:31.900> turn<00:03:32.350> without<00:03:32.890> the<00:03:33.310> cow<00:03:37.200> where

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
through that turn without the cow where

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.050 
through that turn without the cow where
he<00:03:38.320> actually<00:03:38.740> reads<00:03:39.010> that<00:03:39.280> cow<00:03:39.520> all<00:03:39.730> on<00:03:39.910> his

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
he actually reads that cow all on his

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.050 
he actually reads that cow all on his
own<00:03:40.240> this<00:03:41.170> four-year-old<00:03:41.800> is<00:03:42.160> just<00:03:42.700> getting

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
own this four-year-old is just getting

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.760 
own this four-year-old is just getting
to<00:03:43.180> the<00:03:43.270> point<00:03:43.450> where<00:03:43.630> he<00:03:43.900> really<00:03:44.200> reads<00:03:44.410> a<00:03:44.590> cow

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
to the point where he really reads a cow

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.600 
to the point where he really reads a cow
well<00:03:45.130> and<00:03:45.520> by<00:03:46.330> having<00:03:46.660> the<00:03:47.020> two<00:03:47.290> speeds<00:03:47.740> where

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
well and by having the two speeds where

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.140 
well and by having the two speeds where
I<00:03:48.850> can<00:03:49.120> go<00:03:49.300> slow<00:03:50.040> and<00:03:51.040> get<00:03:51.250> him<00:03:51.400> really<00:03:51.670> to<00:03:51.970> pay

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
I can go slow and get him really to pay

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.570 
I can go slow and get him really to pay
attention<00:03:52.720> and<00:03:52.900> then<00:03:53.560> I<00:03:53.709> can<00:03:53.920> start<00:03:54.040> him<00:03:54.400> off

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
attention and then I can start him off

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.930 
attention and then I can start him off
and<00:03:55.030> I<00:03:55.330> can<00:03:55.510> speed<00:03:55.810> that<00:03:56.019> cow<00:03:56.290> up<00:03:56.790> and<00:03:57.790> then

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
and I can speed that cow up and then

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.880 
and I can speed that cow up and then
actually<00:03:58.120> I<00:03:58.360> can<00:03:58.660> slow<00:03:58.900> it<00:03:59.050> back<00:03:59.080> down<00:03:59.260> again

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
actually I can slow it back down again

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.790 
actually I can slow it back down again
and<00:04:00.100> get<00:04:00.580> him<00:04:00.700> to<00:04:00.880> go<00:04:01.269> from<00:04:01.600> fast<00:04:01.959> mode<00:04:02.320> to<00:04:02.560> slow

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.800 
and get him to go from fast mode to slow

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.640 
and get him to go from fast mode to slow
mode<00:04:03.100> himself<00:04:03.610> just<00:04:03.970> like<00:04:04.060> the<00:04:04.360> cow<00:04:04.540> now<00:04:05.350> I<00:04:05.380> can

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
mode himself just like the cow now I can

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.680 
mode himself just like the cow now I can
start<00:04:05.890> slow<00:04:06.190> mode<00:04:06.430> and<00:04:06.670> then<00:04:06.820> speed<00:04:07.120> it<00:04:07.150> up<00:04:07.420> and

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
start slow mode and then speed it up and

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.910 
start slow mode and then speed it up and
go<00:04:07.930> do<00:04:08.019> the<00:04:08.110> opposite<00:04:08.590> then<00:04:08.860> slow<00:04:09.130> it<00:04:09.160> down<00:04:10.920> so

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
go do the opposite then slow it down so

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.790 
go do the opposite then slow it down so
I<00:04:11.950> can<00:04:12.340> do<00:04:12.489> everything<00:04:12.760> an<00:04:13.450> actual<00:04:14.260> real<00:04:14.500> cow

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
I can do everything an actual real cow

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:23.400 
I can do everything an actual real cow
does

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.500 

no<00:04:24.040> when<00:04:24.160> I'm<00:04:24.280> at<00:04:24.430> my<00:04:24.550> ranch<00:04:24.790> I<00:04:25.030> really<00:04:25.300> like

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
no when I'm at my ranch I really like

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:26.730 
no when I'm at my ranch I really like
using<00:04:25.750> the<00:04:25.990> stuffed<00:04:26.260> cow

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
using the stuffed cow

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.770 
using the stuffed cow
but<00:04:27.220> because<00:04:27.550> of<00:04:27.670> the<00:04:27.730> easy<00:04:27.970> system<00:04:28.600> of

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
but because of the easy system of

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.710 
but because of the easy system of
setting<00:04:29.140> up<00:04:29.230> the<00:04:29.470> box<00:04:30.310> and<00:04:30.520> the<00:04:30.640> pulleys<00:04:31.000> a<00:04:31.210> lot

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
setting up the box and the pulleys a lot

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.330 
setting up the box and the pulleys a lot
of<00:04:31.840> times<00:04:32.050> I'll<00:04:32.230> just<00:04:32.260> take<00:04:32.650> the<00:04:32.770> flag<00:04:33.010> when<00:04:33.310> I

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
of times I'll just take the flag when I
