00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.329

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.460
 it's too good 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.610

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.329
 bananas and raisins so in a 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.460
 first time I mix the fruits 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.559
 reds and cereals and then I 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.010
 will come added bananas all 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:08.340
 just go laying out in circle 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.490
 all around in the bowl to finish by the 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.229
 cover with raisins and that's it 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.610

 just said i propose you so is there 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.970
 is a bit of a guigou and yogo 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.720
 yogurt but in English it's better 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.939
 yagg hoc 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.350
 good brief yogurt so you will need 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.920
 just white cheese honey and 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.960
 lime 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.700
 so that's really a recipe 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:42.060
 super simple and it's really delicious 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.740
 it's very simple and I love it so I 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.990
 already warn this recipe it will take the 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.759
 let stand 15 minutes cool 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.979
 will need cottage cheese honey and 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.960
 2 lemons after putting cheese 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.790
 white in a bowl you add it so 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.060
 honey and lime slices 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.250
 And now, it's over 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.530
 a little more colorful and tastier 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.180
 we just have them frozen then 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.600
 it's the ice creams in the water there you know 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.130
 just so there I used 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.619
 two kinds of frozen that I'm going to 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.850
 show right away so for these 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.190
 ice cream in water you will need to 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.050
 various siro me I took syrup 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.140
 Grapefruit syrup request from the 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.000
 Grenadine and a multifruit juice 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.970
 so I come with even the syrup of 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.260
 mint and grapefruit syrup in 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.180
 the first compartment is in the 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.739
 second game but the juice and grenadine 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.000
 you can add water in 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.940
 depending on the taste you want 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.069
 get it all simple in mind a 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.280
 little ice cream makes a banana smoothie 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:39.650
 red fruit and frozen set curling also 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.989
 and it's just a small place to 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.880
 lips it's really super beautiful too 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.470
 that's another way of drinking or 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.550
 so eat a smoothie for this smoothie 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.190
 frozen if we can say you'll 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.310
 need bananas and red berries 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:57.799
 as well as you will mix in AIC 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.790
 a container to blender or any 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.019
 you simply put everything in a 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.230
 blender and you mix 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:04.880
 so I took something like that 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.220
 for smoothies but a blender 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.200
 it's fine then you pour them into 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.030
 the two shots into two compartments and 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.370
 you put it in the freezer that's all 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:17.420
 simple the result is just too cute 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.700
 and it's just delicious here for the 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.970
 end I want to tell you the chocolate 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.489
 here I added a little in cost 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:29.180
 the less she is here to finish with 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:31.850
 one side a little less to be in love with 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.269
 skewers of chocolate fruit it's 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.269

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.660
 too good so for the latter 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:42.760
 recipe I used chocolate that 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.080
 I melt with butter so 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.269

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.400
