A<00:00:10.830> so<00:00:11.130> let's<00:00:11.309> get<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.610> first<00:00:11.820> question

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:12.290 
A so let's get to the first question

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.749 
A so let's get to the first question
dietary<00:00:13.290> cholesterol<00:00:13.530> intake<00:00:14.250> for<00:00:14.490> people

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
dietary cholesterol intake for people

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.939 
dietary cholesterol intake for people
who<00:00:14.820> exercises<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.900> 300<00:00:16.320> milligram<00:00:16.680> limit

who exercises the 300 milligram limit

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.300 
who exercises the 300 milligram limit
raised<00:00:17.220> for<00:00:17.580> athletes<00:00:18.830> tricky<00:00:19.830> question<00:00:20.220> I

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
raised for athletes tricky question I

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.130 
raised for athletes tricky question I
usually<00:00:20.430> tell<00:00:20.789> people<00:00:20.939> with<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.689> saturated

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
usually tell people with the saturated

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.279 
usually tell people with the saturated
fat<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.800> keep<00:00:23.039> it<00:00:23.160> at<00:00:23.279> those<00:00:23.369> recommendations

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 
fat to keep it at those recommendations

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.700 
fat to keep it at those recommendations
that<00:00:25.289> are<00:00:25.350> given<00:00:25.740> for<00:00:25.769> untrained<00:00:26.490> people<00:00:26.730> and

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
that are given for untrained people and

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.009 
that are given for untrained people and
for<00:00:28.710> cholesterol<00:00:29.390> probably<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.539> same<00:00:30.779> that

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
for cholesterol probably the same that

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.780 
for cholesterol probably the same that
we<00:00:31.140> could<00:00:31.289> argue<00:00:31.560> about<00:00:31.590> this<00:00:31.949> all<00:00:32.099> day<00:00:32.189> long

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
we could argue about this all day long

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.090 
we could argue about this all day long
as<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.180> which<00:00:33.329> one<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:33.660> right<00:00:33.899> or<00:00:34.079> wrong<00:00:34.260> but

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
as to which one is right or wrong but

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.790 
as to which one is right or wrong but
the<00:00:35.250> reality<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:35.820> athletes<00:00:36.510> have<00:00:36.960> much<00:00:37.440> lower

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
the reality is athletes have much lower

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.830 
the reality is athletes have much lower
risk<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.340> all<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:38.670> these<00:00:38.820> diseases<00:00:39.210> as<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.690> is

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
risk of all of these diseases as it is

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.630 
risk of all of these diseases as it is
caused<00:00:40.110> by<00:00:40.290> this<00:00:40.530> so<00:00:40.710> they<00:00:40.829> probably<00:00:41.129> do<00:00:41.610> have

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
caused by this so they probably do have

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.639 
caused by this so they probably do have
a<00:00:42.239> lot<00:00:43.200> more<00:00:44.010> leeway<00:00:44.250> on<00:00:44.430> all<00:00:44.700> of<00:00:44.820> these<00:00:44.940> things

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
a lot more leeway on all of these things

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.170 
a lot more leeway on all of these things
but<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.800> question<00:00:47.160> becomes<00:00:47.309> if<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:48.000> don't

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
but the question becomes if you don't

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.090 
but the question becomes if you don't
need<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.930> it's<00:00:49.020> not<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.530> type<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.920> diet

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
need to and it's not the type of diet

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.439 
need to and it's not the type of diet
that<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.430> just<00:00:50.640> love<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.120> feel<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.390> you

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
that you just love and feel that you

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.930 
that you just love and feel that you
have<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.719> have<00:00:51.870> if<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.140> don't<00:00:52.940> personally

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
have to have if you don't personally

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.880 
have to have if you don't personally
feel<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.629> need<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.199> eat<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.350> really<00:00:55.649> high

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
feel the need to eat a really high

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.130 
feel the need to eat a really high
cholesterol<00:00:56.430> diet<00:00:56.760> for<00:00:57.090> your<00:00:57.270> own<00:00:57.510> personal

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
cholesterol diet for your own personal

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.470 
cholesterol diet for your own personal
well-being<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.829> enjoyment<00:00:59.129> then<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.059> wouldn't

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
well-being and enjoyment then I wouldn't

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.000 
well-being and enjoyment then I wouldn't
just<00:01:00.629> go<00:01:00.780> randomly<00:01:01.350> start<00:01:01.680> adding

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
just go randomly start adding

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.740 
just go randomly start adding
cholesterol<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.789> just<00:01:03.120> because<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.539> feel

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
cholesterol and just because you feel

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.070 
cholesterol and just because you feel
like<00:01:05.210> potential<00:01:06.210> risk<00:01:06.479> from<00:01:06.600> all<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:06.960> are

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
like potential risk from all of that are

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.500 
like potential risk from all of that are
massively<00:01:07.560> mitigated<00:01:08.280> by<00:01:08.490> your<00:01:09.060> athletic

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
massively mitigated by your athletic

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.030 
massively mitigated by your athletic
lifestyle<00:01:09.900> which<00:01:10.110> they<00:01:10.290> are<00:01:10.439> they<00:01:11.070> are<00:01:11.780> and<00:01:13.040> I

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
lifestyle which they are they are and I

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.160 
lifestyle which they are they are and I
will<00:01:14.220> tell<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.430> lot<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.729> people<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.330> activity

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
will tell a lot of people that activity

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.530 
will tell a lot of people that activity
and<00:01:16.320> training<00:01:16.890> can<00:01:17.250> get<00:01:17.520> around<00:01:17.850> certain

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
and training can get around certain

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.390 
and training can get around certain
aspects<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.200> bad<00:01:19.409> diet<00:01:19.680> in<00:01:19.920> terms<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:20.250> health

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
aspects of a bad diet in terms of health

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.440 
aspects of a bad diet in terms of health
risk<00:01:20.670> we<00:01:20.820> know<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.270> can<00:01:21.450> but<00:01:23.299> yeah<00:01:24.299> that's

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
risk we know that it can but yeah that's

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.090 
risk we know that it can but yeah that's
kind<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.869> tough<00:01:25.049> one<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.259> answer<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.860> limit

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
kind of a tough one to answer the limit

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.890 
kind of a tough one to answer the limit
is<00:01:26.220> probably<00:01:26.729> raised<00:01:26.970> but<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.299> also<00:01:27.450> don't<00:01:27.689> want

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
is probably raised but I also don't want

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.210 
is probably raised but I also don't want
to<00:01:27.960> tell<00:01:28.110> people<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.439> go<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.829> just<00:01:28.979> cram

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
to tell people to go and just cram

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.710 
to tell people to go and just cram
themselves<00:01:29.460> full<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:29.939> massive<00:01:30.270> amounts<00:01:30.390> of

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
themselves full of massive amounts of

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.020 
themselves full of massive amounts of
cholesterol<00:01:31.490> because<00:01:32.490> that's<00:01:32.790> how<00:01:32.880> people

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
cholesterol because that's how people

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.240 
cholesterol because that's how people
will<00:01:33.360> misconstrue<00:01:34.290> me<00:01:34.590> saying<00:01:34.890> something

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
will misconstrue me saying something

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.640 
will misconstrue me saying something
like<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:36.000> that<00:01:36.630> because<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.290> said<00:01:37.500> well

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
like that is that because I said well

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.499 
like that is that because I said well
you<00:01:37.710> can<00:01:37.829> eat<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:37.950> lot<00:01:38.189> more<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.909> lot<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.329> things

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
you can eat a lot more a lot of things

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.300 
you can eat a lot more a lot of things
safely<00:01:39.990> if<00:01:40.530> you're<00:01:40.770> extremely<00:01:41.100> athletic

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
safely if you're extremely athletic

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.030 
safely if you're extremely athletic
doesn't<00:01:42.090> mean<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.659> should<00:01:43.140> go<00:01:43.380> do<00:01:43.619> so<00:01:43.890> or

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
doesn't mean that you should go do so or

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.499 
doesn't mean that you should go do so or
that<00:01:44.070> I'm<00:01:44.340> telling<00:01:44.610> people<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:45.119> it's<00:01:45.299> the

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
that I'm telling people that it's the

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.109 
that I'm telling people that it's the
best<00:01:45.720> choice<00:01:46.490> it's<00:01:47.490> just<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:47.939> you're

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
best choice it's just that you're

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.940 
best choice it's just that you're
probably<00:01:48.540> removing<00:01:49.229> most<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.560> risk<00:01:49.799> of

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
probably removing most of the risk of

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.499 
probably removing most of the risk of
doing<00:01:50.100> so<00:01:51.049> all<00:01:52.049> right<00:01:52.200> next<00:01:52.409> question

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
are superior to back squats for overall

which one would you recommend and why I
