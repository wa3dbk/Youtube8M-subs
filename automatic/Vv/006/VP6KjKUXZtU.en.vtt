00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
mix-up which leads people to think that

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.650 
mix-up which leads people to think that
it<00:00:57.390> may<00:00:57.899> not<00:00:58.109> be<00:00:58.350> true<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:59.070> as<00:01:00.739> it<00:01:01.739> goes<00:01:01.980> on

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
really is a confirmed and but it is in a

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.880 
really is a confirmed and but it is in a
way<00:01:15.290> anticipated<00:01:16.290> we're<00:01:16.409> all<00:01:16.530> anticipating

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
way anticipated we're all anticipating

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.760 
way anticipated we're all anticipating
this<00:01:17.430> because<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:18.390> know<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.659> Tendo<00:01:18.930> 64<00:01:19.470> games

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
this because you know the Tendo 64 games

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.249 
this because you know the Tendo 64 games
minute<00:01:20.189> there<00:01:20.930> to<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.470> current<00:01:22.890> wii<00:01:24.259> virtual

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
minute there to the current wii virtual

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.270 
minute there to the current wii virtual
console<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.400> would<00:01:26.610> make<00:01:26.640> sense<00:01:27.000> that

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
console so it would make sense that

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.620 
console so it would make sense that
Nintendo<00:01:29.280> GameCube<00:01:29.520> games<00:01:30.000> will<00:01:30.299> make<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.600> to

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
Nintendo GameCube games will make it to

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
the wii u since some a lot of people are

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.069 
the wii u since some a lot of people are
saying<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:35.329> the<00:01:36.329> wii<00:01:36.540> u<00:01:37.439> will<00:01:37.680> support<00:01:39.079> 8

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
saying that the wii u will support 8

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.230 
saying that the wii u will support 8
gigs<00:01:40.939> gigabyte<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:42.180> memory<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:44.240> the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
gigs gigabyte of memory and that the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.670 
gigs gigabyte of memory and that the
gain<00:01:45.450> up<00:01:45.720> gamecube<00:01:46.320> discs<00:01:46.890> are<00:01:47.810> 1.4<00:01:48.810> gigs<00:01:49.380> of

gain up gamecube discs are 1.4 gigs of

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.480 
gain up gamecube discs are 1.4 gigs of
memory<00:01:50.060> so<00:01:51.439> they're<00:01:52.439> saying<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.220> will<00:01:53.399> be

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
memory so they're saying that it will be

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.539 
memory so they're saying that it will be
a<00:01:53.520> problem<00:01:53.790> because<00:01:54.290> you<00:01:55.290> know<00:01:55.470> that's<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.369> lot

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
a problem because you know that's a lot

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.929 
a problem because you know that's a lot
of<00:01:56.579> memory<00:01:57.090> i<00:01:57.119> mean<00:01:57.570> it's<00:01:57.750> basically<00:01:57.899> what<00:01:58.939> you

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
of memory i mean it's basically what you

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.670 
of memory i mean it's basically what you
put<00:02:00.240> only<00:02:00.420> eight<00:02:00.780> games<00:02:01.140> on<00:02:01.380> there<00:02:01.500> above

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
put only eight games on there above

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.130 
put only eight games on there above
course<00:02:02.009> we<00:02:02.820> don't<00:02:03.000> know<00:02:03.240> if<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:03.630> is<00:02:03.810> true<00:02:04.020> or

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
course we don't know if this is true or

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.679 
course we don't know if this is true or
not<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:04.680> it's<00:02:05.399> just<00:02:05.640> right<00:02:05.850> now<00:02:06.030> up<00:02:06.299> in<00:02:06.479> air

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
not so it's just right now up in air

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.140 
not so it's just right now up in air
speculation<00:02:07.970> also<00:02:08.970> Nintendo<00:02:09.929> goes<00:02:10.440> on<00:02:10.860> a

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.449 
trademarking all these wii u things
sometime<00:02:18.780> i<00:02:18.930> believe<00:02:19.260> will<00:02:19.530> actually<00:02:19.980> be<00:02:20.189> game

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
sometime i believe will actually be game

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.910 
sometime i believe will actually be game
some<00:02:20.849> of<00:02:20.939> them<00:02:21.060> are<00:02:21.299> just<00:02:21.659> so<00:02:22.379> that<00:02:22.590> other

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
some of them are just so that other

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.420 
some of them are just so that other
companies<00:02:23.719> won't<00:02:24.719> use<00:02:26.239> the<00:02:27.239> labels<00:02:28.079> name<00:02:28.430> so

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
companies won't use the labels name so

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.910 
companies won't use the labels name so
i'll<00:02:29.969> put<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.329> list<00:02:30.599> in<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:30.989> description<00:02:31.019> and

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
i'll put the list in the description and

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.280 
i'll put the list in the description and
there's<00:02:32.609> only<00:02:32.760> a<00:02:32.909> few<00:02:33.209> dow<00:02:33.420> go<00:02:33.719> through<00:02:33.959> that

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
there's only a few dow go through that

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.679 
there's only a few dow go through that
uh<00:02:34.349> i<00:02:34.889> think<00:02:35.310> that<00:02:35.639> would<00:02:35.760> really<00:02:35.790> be<00:02:36.030> games

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:36.689 
uh i think that would really be games

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:40.940 
uh i think that would really be games
like<00:02:37.250> wii<00:02:38.250> u<00:02:38.489> party<00:02:39.260> that's<00:02:40.260> one<00:02:40.560> of<00:02:40.680> them<00:02:40.799> i

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
like wii u party that's one of them i

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.179 
like wii u party that's one of them i
think<00:02:40.980> that<00:02:41.340> will<00:02:41.489> most<00:02:42.120> likely<00:02:42.450> be<00:02:42.629> a<00:02:42.840> game

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:43.189 
think that will most likely be a game

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:47.690 
think that will most likely be a game
like<00:02:44.189> we<00:02:44.519> party<00:02:44.909> is<00:02:45.060> on<00:02:45.470> on<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.919> current<00:02:47.459> gym

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
like we party is on on the current gym

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.710 
like we party is on on the current gym
and<00:02:48.000> that<00:02:48.919> on<00:02:49.919> the<00:02:50.370> wii<00:02:50.669> u<00:02:50.879> it<00:02:51.180> will<00:02:51.359> be<00:02:51.480> the

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
and that on the wii u it will be the

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.979 
and that on the wii u it will be the
sequel<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.500> that<00:02:52.680> version<00:02:53.519> on<00:02:54.030> a<00:02:54.060> previous

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
sequel to that version on a previous

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.099 
sequel to that version on a previous
installment<00:02:55.680> of<00:02:55.829> the<00:02:56.579> week<00:02:56.790> so<00:02:57.239> i<00:02:57.540> think

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
installment of the week so i think

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:01.750 
installment of the week so i think
that's<00:02:58.500> going<00:02:58.799> to<00:02:58.889> be<00:02:59.069> a<00:02:59.810> possible<00:03:00.810> game<00:03:01.049> also

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
that's going to be a possible game also

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.459 
that's going to be a possible game also
what<00:03:02.760> I<00:03:02.790> also<00:03:03.060> think<00:03:03.480> that<00:03:03.719> will<00:03:04.230> be<00:03:04.260> a

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:04.469 
what I also think that will be a

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:08.149 
what I also think that will be a
possible<00:03:05.040> game<00:03:05.219> is<00:03:05.489> wii<00:03:06.419> sports<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:07.169> wii<00:03:07.919> u

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:08.159 
possible game is wii sports and wii u

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:10.819 
possible game is wii sports and wii u
play<00:03:08.549> so<00:03:09.299> we<00:03:09.540> use<00:03:09.750> sports<00:03:10.139> and<00:03:10.349> will<00:03:10.469> you<00:03:10.560> play
