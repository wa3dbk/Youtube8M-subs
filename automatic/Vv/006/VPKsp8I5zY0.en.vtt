these but there's some problems with
them<00:00:39.350> after<00:00:40.350> 10<00:00:40.559> weeks<00:00:41.300> because<00:00:42.300> they<00:00:42.540> like<00:00:43.260> to

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
them after 10 weeks because they like to

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.180 
them after 10 weeks because they like to
eat<00:00:43.410> so<00:00:43.739> much<00:00:44.090> they<00:00:45.090> continue<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.780> eat<00:00:46.190> they

don't do anything other than e they also

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.779 
don't do anything other than e they also
have<00:00:52.320> physical<00:00:52.860> problems<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:54.410> while<00:00:55.410> their

cardiovascular system just isn't meant

cardiovascular system just isn't meant
to<00:01:02.820> keep<00:01:03.570> up<00:01:03.719> with<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.080> now<00:01:06.110> I<00:01:07.110> expect<00:01:07.799> these

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
to keep up with it now I expect these

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.840 
to keep up with it now I expect these
guys<00:01:08.400> don't<00:01:09.060> walk<00:01:09.390> very<00:01:09.420> well<00:01:10.340> if<00:01:11.340> you'd<00:01:11.580> see

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
guys don't walk very well if you'd see

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.050 
guys don't walk very well if you'd see
their<00:01:12.060> feet<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:13.580> feel<00:01:14.580> pretty<00:01:15.470> gnarly<00:01:16.470> oh<00:01:17.060> these

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
their feet I feel pretty gnarly oh these

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.880 
their feet I feel pretty gnarly oh these
guys<00:01:18.360> weren't<00:01:18.630> necessarily<00:01:19.080> kept<00:01:19.409> in<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.680> cage

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
guys weren't necessarily kept in a cage

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.340 
guys weren't necessarily kept in a cage
they<00:01:20.159> were<00:01:20.220> kept<00:01:20.549> fairly<00:01:20.759> well<00:01:21.150> but<00:01:21.180> it's<00:01:22.110> the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
they were kept fairly well but it's the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.120 
they were kept fairly well but it's the
breed<00:01:23.479> they<00:01:24.479> can<00:01:24.659> barely<00:01:25.080> barely<00:01:25.680> move<00:01:25.860> around

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
breed they can barely barely move around

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.460 
breed they can barely barely move around
see<00:01:26.520> they're<00:01:26.729> waddling<00:01:26.970> if<00:01:27.810> we<00:01:28.020> let<00:01:28.170> them<00:01:28.320> out

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
see they're waddling if we let them out

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.469 
see they're waddling if we let them out
all<00:01:29.220> they<00:01:29.520> would<00:01:29.670> do<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:29.970> waddle<00:01:30.360> around

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
all they would do is waddle around

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.569 
all they would do is waddle around
probably<00:01:31.140> head<00:01:31.259> for<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.500> food<00:01:31.680> boot<00:01:31.979> food

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
probably head for the food boot food

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.719 
probably head for the food boot food
dish<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.270> stick<00:01:34.079> their<00:01:34.290> head<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:37.729> now

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
dish and stick their head in it now

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.350 
dish and stick their head in it now
anyone<00:01:39.119> anyone<00:01:39.810> who's<00:01:39.960> serious<00:01:40.409> about

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
anyone anyone who's serious about

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.740 
anyone anyone who's serious about
growing<00:01:42.360> chickens<00:01:42.960> for<00:01:43.740> meat<00:01:44.390> grows<00:01:45.390> these

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
growing chickens for meat grows these

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.050 
growing chickens for meat grows these
because<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:47.520> conversion<00:01:48.060> ratio<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:48.899> high

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
because the conversion ratio is so high

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.319 
because the conversion ratio is so high
you<00:01:51.060> get<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.270> good<00:01:51.540> rate<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.899> return

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
you get a good rate of return

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:56.800 
you get a good rate of return
unfortunately<00:01:54.590> even<00:01:55.590> if<00:01:55.920> they're<00:01:56.130> organic

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
unfortunately even if they're organic

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.940 
unfortunately even if they're organic
there's<00:01:57.810> still<00:01:58.140> this<00:01:58.740> type<00:01:59.100> of<00:01:59.130> hybrid<00:01:59.460> and

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
there's still this type of hybrid and

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.490 
there's still this type of hybrid and
they<00:02:01.950> really<00:02:02.310> aren't<00:02:02.520> intended<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:04.079> live<00:02:04.259> like

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
they really aren't intended to live like

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.059 
they really aren't intended to live like
chickens<00:02:05.119> to<00:02:06.119> act<00:02:06.299> like<00:02:06.450> chickens<00:02:07.069> there's

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
chickens to act like chickens there's

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.130 
chickens to act like chickens there's
just<00:02:08.340> little<00:02:08.459> meet<00:02:08.759> growing<00:02:09.030> machines

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.640 

so<00:02:14.140> organic<00:02:14.710> isn't<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.130> solution<00:02:16.470> if<00:02:17.470> you

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
so organic isn't the solution if you

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.360 
so organic isn't the solution if you
want<00:02:17.890> ethical<00:02:18.310> birds<00:02:19.830> ethical<00:02:20.830> birds<00:02:21.040> means

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
want ethical birds ethical birds means

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.420 
want ethical birds ethical birds means
not<00:02:22.560> raising<00:02:23.560> livestock<00:02:23.740> like<00:02:24.310> this<00:02:24.520> at<00:02:24.700> all

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
not raising livestock like this at all

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.840 
not raising livestock like this at all
livestock<00:02:27.430> that<00:02:27.880> is<00:02:28.060> is<00:02:29.020> basically

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
livestock that is is basically

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.500 
livestock that is is basically
completely<00:02:30.850> dependent<00:02:31.450> on<00:02:31.540> care<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:33.480> has<00:02:34.480> a

completely dependent on care and has a

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.980 
completely dependent on care and has a
high<00:02:34.750> mortality<00:02:34.960> rate<00:02:35.470> for<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:37.720> sake<00:02:37.960> of

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
high mortality rate for the sake of

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.310 
high mortality rate for the sake of
growing<00:02:38.500> meat<00:02:38.740> very<00:02:39.250> quickly<00:02:40.080> there<00:02:41.080> were

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
growing meat very quickly there were

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.470 
growing meat very quickly there were
four<00:02:41.650> of<00:02:41.830> these<00:02:41.980> birds<00:02:42.310> but<00:02:42.640> to<00:02:43.090> have<00:02:43.210> died

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
four of these birds but to have died

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.750 
four of these birds but to have died
it's<00:02:44.260> very<00:02:44.410> common<00:02:44.890> that<00:02:44.920> these<00:02:45.190> birds<00:02:45.430> die

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
it's very common that these birds die

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.480 
it's very common that these birds die
suddenly<00:02:46.120> their<00:02:46.630> hearts<00:02:47.020> give<00:02:47.260> out<00:02:47.490> because

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
suddenly their hearts give out because

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.210 
suddenly their hearts give out because
they<00:02:48.640> can't<00:02:48.850> handle<00:02:49.770> their<00:02:50.770> physical<00:02:51.340> nature

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
they can't handle their physical nature

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.030 
they can't handle their physical nature
we<00:02:54.220> were<00:02:54.870> given<00:02:55.870> these<00:02:56.020> birds<00:02:56.320> or<00:02:56.590> these<00:02:56.770> birds
