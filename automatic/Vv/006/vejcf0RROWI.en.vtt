 then we do back and jailbreak 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.539
 at this point we wait for it to pass 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:50.309

00:00:45.539 --> 00:01:02.489

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:58.120
 you can see cydia appeared and if not 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:01.209
 it appears immediately at the first start you have to 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.690
 make a boot tetre of the put you have to do it 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.040
 also every time you turn off yours 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.500
 device leader because this is a 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.390
 short the trade so every time 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.299

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.190
 disabled to review here where 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:17.650
 you have to do a bad job and the thread is it 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.150
 you will also have to do the first time if 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:25.690
 cydia will not appear then you do 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:30.190
 extras select of psv select this 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:32.980

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:36.660
 already now even while holding the 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.660
 power and home button for 10 seconds 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.220
 and we wait 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:12.620
 and here it is that now it restarts with the 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:15.790
 la pineapple logo I would say resino and not 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.790
 we'll have to do nothing but wait 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.139
 well once it is restarted for 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:03.150
 those who did not find it is now one 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:05.599
 Once it is unlocked they will then find it 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:09.720
