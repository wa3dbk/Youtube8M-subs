00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.109
 remember that you have the recipe for 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.410
 written and detailed in sweet land 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.410
 dot com 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:40.320
 you like eggs union and to judge in addition 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:44.329
 in a little 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.329
 and we will capture it as thanks 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.020
 The first thing we are going to do is put the 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.870
 yogurt in a jar or glass of 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.120
 mixer 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.649
 that's worth any milkshake now mini 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.250
 first we do not need any power 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.250
 special 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.400
 we add the sugar for 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.250
 and the same with cheese spread and what 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.400
 I have here prepared so I'm going to go 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.649
 putting in we can use any weight 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.390
 that has more or less this texture like this 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:21.510
 that if you have any mind that you like 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:24.000
 much you already know the effect with him 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.920
 and we're also going to add the honey that 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.900
 As you can see, it will be liquid because I have 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.960
 heated in the microwave until I 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.909
 take that liquid liquid point to 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.799
 in 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.030
 and now that we have it in your glass 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.499
 blender there 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.659
 good blender mini first as what 

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:43.159
 you want to call we give you until 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:46.159
 let's have a uniform cream 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.619
 in a couple of minutes we have it ready 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.079
 you see that it is like a liquid or dense 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.500
 Well, this is the point that 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:53.500
 we were looking for 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.250
 and now with care so that we do not 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.820
 drop nothing nothing nothing of shell inside 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:06.000
 we are going to add the eggs one after 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:09.440
 another to enter also as you see the 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.140
 recipe come on let's go difficulty 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.710
 nonexistent total come the third and 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.710
 we follow 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.090
 we give it a quick touch with the blender 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.700
 so that the egg is well integrated 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.120
 You see pick up a little bit more color 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.370
 beige cream 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.560
 and we are going to add the following 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.260
 ingredient that is the trickle of liquor 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.489
 or water of orange blossom good you can change it 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.440
 also if you want for a bit of 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.569
 grated of some citrus a lemon a 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.430
 orange that to the consumer's taste 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.170
 and as you imagine, it is a 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.579
 little touch with the blender so that 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.579
 distribute for all the cream 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.049
 and we have sat the mold well with 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.840
 butter so that later you give us 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:58.640
 mold much more easily and what 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.390
 fill with this cremita that we have 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.440
 prepared 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.290
 and until almost 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:09.040
 with the oven preheated to 180 degrees 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:11.049
 Nothing, we put it inside 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.909
 we will have it for about 30 minutes 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:17.170
 until when pierced with a toothpick 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:19.480
 this one comes out clean come well 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.700
 as you will see when you take it out of the oven there will be 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.430
 gone up a bit but do not worry that 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:28.069
 Tempering will take the form perfectly 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.980
 we let it cool to temperature 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:33.049
 environment and once tempered we keep it 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.930
 in the refrigerator or refrigerator during 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:37.879
 less two hours and to serve it look 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.890
 what trick I warmed a couple of 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:42.230
 spoonfuls of honey in the microwave with 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.569
 half a teaspoon of butter and look 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.780
 what juiciest cream we have prepared 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:49.219
 in a jiffy and now distribute it without 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.310
 little with the spoon so that it is 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:55.040
 uniform and ready and to end the 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.980
 decoration is good to put a touch 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.590
 crunchy in this case some nuts the 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.950
 we have here divided in half and the 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.200
 we are going to distribute by the hoop so in each 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.230
 portion will remain a touch of fruits 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.329
 dry that looks perfect that we think 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.900
 the result that looks good 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:17.840
 well then when you see the cut you go 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.209
 to suck your fingers, look, look, look 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.699
