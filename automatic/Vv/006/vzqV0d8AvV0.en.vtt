modules<00:01:25.360> niche<00:01:25.570> longer<00:01:25.930> my<00:01:26.470> case<00:01:26.740> i'm<00:01:26.890> a<00:01:26.979> 29

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
modules niche longer my case i'm a 29

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.910 
modules niche longer my case i'm a 29
inch<00:01:27.430> draw<00:01:27.790> so<00:01:28.210> how<00:01:28.930> are<00:01:28.990> you<00:01:29.110> two<00:01:29.229> okay<00:01:29.860> so

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
inch draw so how are you two okay so

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.320 
inch draw so how are you two okay so
this<00:01:30.159> but<00:01:30.369> would<00:01:30.430> work<00:01:30.610> good<00:01:30.729> for<00:01:30.790> both<00:01:31.030> of<00:01:31.210> us

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
this but would work good for both of us

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.080 
this but would work good for both of us
so<00:01:31.930> what<00:01:32.080> we<00:01:32.229> would<00:01:32.409> do<00:01:32.590> will<00:01:33.400> test<00:01:33.700> this<00:01:33.850> bow

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
so what we would do will test this bow

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.790 
so what we would do will test this bow
without<00:01:34.270> the<00:01:34.600> grip<00:01:34.810> on<00:01:34.990> it<00:01:35.050> with<00:01:35.290> a<00:01:35.320> 29-inch

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
without the grip on it with a 29-inch

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.980 
without the grip on it with a 29-inch
modules<00:01:36.430> in<00:01:36.580> it<00:01:36.730> you<00:01:37.150> can<00:01:37.360> see<00:01:37.540> what<00:01:37.660> we<00:01:37.780> shoot

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
modules in it you can see what we shoot

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.870 
modules in it you can see what we shoot
and<00:01:38.200> then<00:01:38.680> we'll<00:01:38.920> change<00:01:39.160> out<00:01:39.310> the<00:01:39.430> modules

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
and then we'll change out the modules

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.050 
and then we'll change out the modules
put<00:01:40.090> 30s<00:01:40.510> put<00:01:41.320> the<00:01:41.440> speed<00:01:41.650> grip<00:01:41.860> on<00:01:42.100> so<00:01:42.760> the<00:01:42.940> bow

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
put 30s put the speed grip on so the bow

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.790 
put 30s put the speed grip on so the bow
still<00:01:43.360> fit<00:01:43.570> us<00:01:43.750> so<00:01:44.140> we<00:01:44.260> won't<00:01:44.410> get<00:01:44.500> arms

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
still fit us so we won't get arms

to verify what it is and here's the one

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.490 
to verify what it is and here's the one
that<00:05:37.449> came<00:05:37.539> out<00:05:37.750> with<00:05:37.930> just<00:05:38.080> a<00:05:38.139> 20-9<00:05:39.180> t9<00:05:40.500> PSC's

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
that came out with just a 20-9 t9 PSC's

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.439 
that came out with just a 20-9 t9 PSC's
29-inch<00:05:42.159> module<00:05:44.759> and<00:05:45.759> then<00:05:45.909> after<00:05:46.120> we<00:05:46.210> get<00:05:46.300> the

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:46.449 
29-inch module and then after we get the

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:48.929 
29-inch module and then after we get the
30s<00:05:46.840> in<00:05:47.050> we're<00:05:47.259> going<00:05:47.379> to<00:05:47.439> redo<00:05:47.710> the<00:05:47.800> tests<00:05:48.729> on

00:05:48.929 --> 00:05:48.939 
30s in we're going to redo the tests on

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:51.510 
30s in we're going to redo the tests on
the<00:05:49.539> speed<00:05:49.870> so<00:05:50.680> you<00:05:50.770> can<00:05:50.889> see<00:05:51.069> the<00:05:51.159> difference

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
the speed so you can see the difference

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.119 
the speed so you can see the difference
in<00:05:51.699> speed<00:05:52.330> from<00:05:52.690> one<00:05:52.870> inch<00:05:53.050> to<00:05:53.199> another<00:05:53.440> with<00:05:54.099> a

00:05:54.119 --> 00:05:54.129 
in speed from one inch to another with a

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:55.950 
in speed from one inch to another with a
speed<00:05:54.400> grip<00:05:54.610> come<00:05:55.000> in<00:05:55.150> to<00:05:55.270> help<00:05:55.419> you<00:05:55.569> gain

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
speed grip come in to help you gain

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.980 
speed grip come in to help you gain
speed<00:05:57.060> so<00:05:58.060> we'll<00:05:58.180> put<00:05:58.300> this<00:05:58.360> being<00:05:58.599> grip<00:05:58.780> on<00:05:58.960> it

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
speed so we'll put this being grip on it

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:07.830 
speed so we'll put this being grip on it
now<00:05:59.229> with<00:06:00.190> the<00:06:00.250> 30<00:06:00.460> inch<00:06:00.610> modules<00:06:01.060> in<00:06:01.210> it<00:06:06.840> and

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 
now with the 30 inch modules in it and

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.740 
now with the 30 inch modules in it and
we're<00:06:07.990> ready<00:06:08.139> to<00:06:08.229> shoot<00:06:09.330> so<00:06:10.330> we'll<00:06:10.479> check<00:06:10.629> the

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:10.750 
we're ready to shoot so we'll check the

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.959 
we're ready to shoot so we'll check the
speed<00:06:10.990> now<00:06:11.199> with<00:06:11.379> the<00:06:11.500> 30s<00:06:11.860> we<00:06:12.460> should<00:06:12.669> we

00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:12.969 
speed now with the 30s we should we

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:15.089 
speed now with the 30s we should we
should<00:06:13.000> seize<00:06:13.419> see<00:06:14.349> a<00:06:14.379> pretty<00:06:14.620> good<00:06:14.740> jump<00:06:14.919> in

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:15.099 
should seize see a pretty good jump in

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:22.520 
should seize see a pretty good jump in
speed

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.530 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.260 

now<00:06:23.530> we've<00:06:23.710> taken<00:06:23.890> out<00:06:24.070> to<00:06:24.160> 29<00:06:24.580> inch<00:06:24.760> cams<00:06:25.030> we

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:25.270 
now we've taken out to 29 inch cams we

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.720 
now we've taken out to 29 inch cams we
put<00:06:25.450> in<00:06:25.570> modules<00:06:26.440> put<00:06:26.980> in<00:06:27.070> the<00:06:27.160> 30s<00:06:27.550> and

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:27.730 
put in modules put in the 30s and

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:30.780 
put in modules put in the 30s and
install<00:06:28.420> the<00:06:28.540> speed<00:06:28.780> grip<00:06:29.020> at<00:06:29.980> 30<00:06:30.340> inch<00:06:30.520> draw

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:30.790 
install the speed grip at 30 inch draw

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.270 
install the speed grip at 30 inch draw
would<00:06:31.180> be<00:06:31.300> an<00:06:31.390> inch<00:06:31.540> long<00:06:31.810> for<00:06:32.140> me<00:06:32.290> but<00:06:33.010> adding

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 
would be an inch long for me but adding

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.700 
would be an inch long for me but adding
the<00:06:33.340> speed<00:06:33.580> grip<00:06:33.850> it<00:06:34.300> equals<00:06:35.140> it<00:06:35.260> out<00:06:35.380> so<00:06:35.620> the

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:35.710 
the speed grip it equals it out so the

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.490 
the speed grip it equals it out so the
bow<00:06:35.860> still<00:06:36.160> 50<00:06:36.490> like<00:06:36.640> a<00:06:36.670> 29<00:06:37.410> that'll<00:06:38.410> be

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:38.500 
bow still 50 like a 29 that'll be

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.500 
bow still 50 like a 29 that'll be
shooting<00:06:38.740> a<00:06:38.770> 30<00:06:38.980> inch<00:06:39.070> bow<00:06:39.430> and<00:06:39.760> gain<00:06:40.150> speed

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:40.510 
shooting a 30 inch bow and gain speed

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:42.540 
shooting a 30 inch bow and gain speed
that<00:06:40.690> way<00:06:40.870> so<00:06:41.740> we'll<00:06:41.830> see<00:06:41.980> how<00:06:42.040> much<00:06:42.100> speed<00:06:42.400> we

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:42.550 
that way so we'll see how much speed we

00:06:42.550 --> 00:07:08.240 
that way so we'll see how much speed we
gain<00:06:42.760> here

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:08.250 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:23.550 

345<00:07:09.250> so<00:07:09.760> it's<00:07:09.910> a<00:07:09.970> gain<00:07:10.150> of<00:07:10.180> about<00:07:10.360> 10<00:07:10.690> feet

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:23.560 

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.659 

well<00:07:24.560> Scott<00:07:24.800> will<00:07:24.949> sure<00:07:25.069> appreciate<00:07:25.520> you
