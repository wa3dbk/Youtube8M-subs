00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.200
 They were very good to everyone here 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.000
 We are going to publish the video review 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.590
 of art in mail but it is very possible that 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.690
 you can not wait in this video we're going 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.459
 to tell the necessary information what 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:19.029
 essential that you must know about the fable 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:20.560
 Chinese without a doubt the huawei state 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.060
 we could say that it is a finished 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.919
 all audiences and is that the size is 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.929
 really big specifically we have 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:28.839
 16 centimeters high 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:32.020
 8.5 centimeters wide 99 millimeters 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:33.250
 of thickness all with a weight of 198 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.810
 grams the truth that we can not 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.699
 catalog it as a featherweight ni 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.140
 much less the material of 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:40.750
 logically build as you can 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.699
 imagine is plastic material and we have 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.109
 the possibility of acquiring it in two 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:46.000
 colors in this case we have the unit 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:47.680
 white but it's also available in 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.780
 black color some features 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.269
 important is that we have slot for 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.020
 microsd cards despite having a 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:55.820
 unibody chassis 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.350
 the size is not the only big thing that 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.000
 have this device since you will see that 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.280
 the specifications are really from 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.620
 top of range huawei processor 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.720
 own production to 15 gigahertz 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.190
 accompanied by 2 gigas of ram and the 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.440
 section also as important as it is 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.300
 that of the internal memory 8gb available 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.100
 of which five are for 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.200
 applications the battery one of the 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.940
 Real strengths of this mail is 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.770
 that we have a 4 thousand 50 battery 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.240
 milliamps one of the largest in the 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.740
 market and in the section on 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.790
 connectivity for virtually all 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:28.190
 bluetooth 4.0 wifi direct usb host radio 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.020
 fm but maybe we miss the chip 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.550
 nfc 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.350
 4.1.2 that is the numbering that is the 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.600
 version that incorporates this oil 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.280
 concretely andrei living is true 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.110
 that is not the latest version of the system 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.790
 operative however the truth is not 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.800
 nothing wrong the customization layer 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.950
 logically it is personalized by game 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.120
 and in this case it's called emotion wi 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.860
 1.5 and the truth that is a layer of 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.240
 organization radically different from what 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.280
 that we are used to has some 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.590
 particularities as for example that no 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.180
 it has apps box and they all go 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.820
 including in an infinite carousel of 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.650
 pages we get to the mother of the lamb 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.030
 one of the true strengths of 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.800
 this Chinese terminal of the mail and it's your 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.270
 screen we said that it is a terminal 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.410
 us for all audiences and that 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.990
 has one of the largest screens 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.180
 of the market specifically 6 as 1 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.920
 inch with ips technology one of my 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.230
 favorite good interpretation of the 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.050
 good viewing angles those colors and 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.400
 resolution hd not full hd and we 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.850
 we find a pixel density 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.350
 per inch of 241 and if you're a little 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.370
 bad zas do not worry too much 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.560
 because we have long gori 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.140
 It's time to talk about the Huawei cameras 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.299
 this is a terminal the giant the camera 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.739
 maybe it's not so much in the back we're going 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:37.450
 to start with the most important we 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.489
 we found with a lens of 8 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.480
 megapixels logically we have the 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.400
 typical functions that we are already 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.409
 accustomed in the high range like the 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.720
 hdr mode and logically we will be able to 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:48.849
 record in full hd if we turn it around 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.409
 in the front we will have 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.510
 a camera for our video calls 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:53.739
 of a megapixel with a detail that is 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.420
 very grateful and that we are quite 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.140
 used to seeing and is that we can 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.730
 record at 720 p 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.310
 good to be have been the 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.410
 specifications the data that you should 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.630
 know all the information the most 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.819
 direct possible that yes a terminal 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.920
 gigantic to many of you for sure 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.300
 that overwhelms you for others will remain 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.620
 practically in love with 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.570
 possibilities that has a size of a 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.490
 6-inch screen and now 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.320
 yes, as always, if this video has 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.000
 seemed little want to see more videos 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.650
 want to see more pictures you want 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.090
 listen to a song or just 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.830
 you want to see the real performance of the 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.330
 guayas game in mail see you in the 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.330
 life review until later
