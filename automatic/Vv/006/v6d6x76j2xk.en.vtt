00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
you the actual how it works like this is

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.920 
you the actual how it works like this is
what<00:02:31.950> it<00:02:32.040> will<00:02:32.160> look<00:02:32.310> like<00:02:32.370> yeah<00:02:33.000> that's<00:02:33.239> not

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
what it will look like yeah that's not

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.540 
what it will look like yeah that's not
how<00:02:34.170> you<00:02:34.230> should<00:02:34.500> do<00:02:34.590> it<00:02:34.709> debut<00:02:35.069> a<00:02:35.129> project

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
how you should do it debut a project

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.210 
how you should do it debut a project
when<00:02:35.670> you<00:02:35.700> do<00:02:35.879> that<00:02:36.060> people<00:02:36.420> roll<00:02:36.840> their<00:02:36.870> eyes

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
when you do that people roll their eyes

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.410 
when you do that people roll their eyes
anyway<00:02:38.220> so<00:02:38.280> that's<00:02:38.640> coming<00:02:38.909> I<00:02:39.030> don't<00:02:39.090> know<00:02:39.239> any

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
anyway so that's coming I don't know any

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.970 
anyway so that's coming I don't know any
details<00:02:39.780> on<00:02:39.900> it<00:02:40.050> but<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.230> suspect

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
details on it but a suspect

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.470 
details on it but a suspect
I<00:02:41.010> don't<00:02:41.220> know<00:02:41.280> all<00:02:41.400> those<00:02:41.519> likes<00:02:41.849> the<00:02:42.030> others

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.210 

but<00:02:48.480> that's<00:02:48.629> all<00:02:48.900> like<00:02:49.140> you<00:02:49.319> are<00:02:49.890> those<00:02:50.069> cases

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
but that's all like you are those cases

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.180 
but that's all like you are those cases
those<00:02:50.700> are<00:02:50.730> probably<00:02:51.180> motion<00:02:51.659> sensors<00:02:52.190> the

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
those are probably motion sensors the

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.899 
those are probably motion sensors the
oculus<00:02:53.819> only<00:02:54.090> has<00:02:54.239> like<00:02:54.510> I<00:02:54.659> think<00:02:54.870> one<00:02:55.260> or<00:02:55.440> two

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:55.909 
oculus only has like I think one or two

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:58.130 
oculus only has like I think one or two
where<00:02:56.909> as<00:02:57.030> this<00:02:57.239> looks<00:02:57.510> like<00:02:57.659> they've<00:02:57.840> decided

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
where as this looks like they've decided

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.880 
where as this looks like they've decided
to<00:02:58.349> I<00:02:59.000> don't<00:03:00.000> know<00:03:00.239> trackers<00:03:00.900> but<00:03:01.440> it's<00:03:01.590> eight

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
to I don't know trackers but it's eight

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.970 
to I don't know trackers but it's eight
they'd<00:03:02.670> be<00:03:02.970> trackers<00:03:03.450> yeah<00:03:04.079> and<00:03:04.319> many<00:03:04.620> many

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
they'd be trackers yeah and many many

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.430 
they'd be trackers yeah and many many
trackers<00:03:05.579> 18

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
trackers 18

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.270 
trackers 18
so<00:03:07.860> and<00:03:08.790> I<00:03:09.270> don't<00:03:09.330> know<00:03:09.750> how<00:03:10.440> many<00:03:10.500> what<00:03:11.070> if<00:03:11.160> it

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
so and I don't know how many what if it

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.040 
so and I don't know how many what if it
just<00:03:11.400> project<00:03:11.790> what's<00:03:12.060> directly<00:03:12.360> in<00:03:12.660> front<00:03:12.900> of

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
just project what's directly in front of

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.620 
just project what's directly in front of
you<00:03:13.140> but<00:03:13.500> in<00:03:13.710> 3d<00:03:15.470> and<00:03:16.470> I<00:03:16.770> don't<00:03:16.950> know<00:03:17.070> what<00:03:17.310> the

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
you but in 3d and I don't know what the

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.150 
you but in 3d and I don't know what the
the<00:03:18.630> Morpheus<00:03:19.080> has<00:03:19.110> but<00:03:19.620> this<00:03:19.770> is<00:03:19.920> definitely

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
the Morpheus has but this is definitely

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.940 
the Morpheus has but this is definitely
different<00:03:20.340> than<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:21.180> oculus<00:03:21.990> really<00:03:22.740> want<00:03:22.890> to

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
different than the oculus really want to

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.440 
different than the oculus really want to
see<00:03:23.070> some<00:03:23.250> footage<00:03:23.400> oculus<00:03:23.910> or<00:03:24.300> they're<00:03:24.420> just

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
see some footage oculus or they're just

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.850 
see some footage oculus or they're just
harder<00:03:24.750> to<00:03:24.870> see<00:03:24.960> are<00:03:25.110> things<00:03:25.410> that<00:03:25.560> they<00:03:25.710> had<00:03:25.830> a

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
harder to see are things that they had a

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.550 
harder to see are things that they had a
Canada's<00:03:26.310> Wonderland<00:03:27.170> and<00:03:28.170> then<00:03:28.290> it<00:03:28.410> has

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
Canada's Wonderland and then it has

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.500 
Canada's Wonderland and then it has
looking<00:03:29.010> things<00:03:29.220> ever<00:03:29.430> on<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:29.940> front<00:03:30.240> it<00:03:30.390> has

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
looking things ever on the front it has

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.930 
looking things ever on the front it has
those<00:03:30.660> two<00:03:30.990> those<00:03:31.560> two<00:03:31.620> window<00:03:32.190> to<00:03:32.250> like<00:03:32.760> what

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
those two those two window to like what

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.150 
those two those two window to like what
look<00:03:33.090> like<00:03:33.120> lenses<00:03:33.720> which<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:34.140> oculus<00:03:34.920> and

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
look like lenses which the oculus and

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.920 
look like lenses which the oculus and
Murphy's<00:03:35.520> also<00:03:35.850> don't<00:03:36.030> have<00:03:36.210> which<00:03:36.480> makes<00:03:36.720> you

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
Murphy's also don't have which makes you

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.450 
Murphy's also don't have which makes you
think<00:03:37.110> that<00:03:37.230> this<00:03:37.470> will<00:03:37.650> also<00:03:37.830> potentially

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:38.460 
think that this will also potentially

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:39.140 
think that this will also potentially
have<00:03:38.610> some<00:03:38.640> more

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
have some more

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.230 
have some more
yeah<00:03:39.300> some<00:03:40.220> augmented<00:03:41.220> reality<00:03:41.250> potential<00:03:42.120> as

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
yeah some augmented reality potential as

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.930 
yeah some augmented reality potential as
well<00:03:42.420> without<00:03:43.020> you<00:03:43.560> know<00:03:43.680> blowing<00:03:44.610> it<00:03:44.820> out

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
well without you know blowing it out

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.320 
well without you know blowing it out
like<00:03:45.320> Microsoft<00:03:46.320> did<00:03:46.560> in<00:03:46.890> pipe<00:03:47.610> dream<00:03:47.910> world

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
like Microsoft did in pipe dream world

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.660 
like Microsoft did in pipe dream world
on<00:03:48.480> so<00:03:49.170> who<00:03:49.290> knows<00:03:49.410> but<00:03:50.160> anyways<00:03:50.460> that's

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
on so who knows but anyways that's

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.880 
on so who knows but anyways that's
coming<00:03:51.120> and<00:03:51.390> maybe<00:03:51.960> we'll<00:03:52.230> see<00:03:52.410> that<00:03:52.560> PAX

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
coming and maybe we'll see that PAX

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.690 
coming and maybe we'll see that PAX
Prime<00:03:53.520> is<00:03:54.150> my<00:03:54.390> guess<00:03:54.630> because<00:03:55.220> that<00:03:56.220> spells

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
Prime is my guess because that spells

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.700 
Prime is my guess because that spells
home<00:03:57.000> they've<00:03:57.450> never<00:03:57.720> gone<00:03:57.930> to<00:03:57.960> pax<00:03:58.320> before
