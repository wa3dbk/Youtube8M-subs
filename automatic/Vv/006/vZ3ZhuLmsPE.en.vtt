 it's wonderful to see the 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:56.170

 the bazaars of the Chinese ourselves 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.670
 we found easily 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.350
 this is a washer that carries some 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:26.300
 perlite used for 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:29.570

 of leather rope and this are bills 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.140
 of which I had from the necklaces this 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.420
 it's a metallica acorn also a 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.820
 necklace 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.120
 here I have another one like this but without 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.580
 open 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.370
 this is also one in terminal 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.650
 a necklace and a crystal pearl that 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.720
 I have amber and this is a 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:01.659
 fast glue 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:04.860
 that hits instantly 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:07.830
 look at the first thing I've done 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.690
 cut the stick to the extent of the light 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:14.569
 of the length that I need for me 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:18.319
 work and embed it and fit it strong 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:21.939
 after as easy as taking a crown 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:26.150
 wide and put it through here by the hole 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:28.939
 if the hole here in the crown is 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.829
 smaller than the thickness of the stick with 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:33.250
 a little bit of DIY drill 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:36.260
 can open or with the tip of a scissors 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.450
 simply moving to the side of 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.129
 towards another 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.129
 we put this account 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:52.090
 love / pretty exhausted 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:55.790
 and it remains as you will see in each 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.819
 totally now I put this other 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.580
 I have opened a little bit of the 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.270
 hole 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:07.860
 because I liked too much 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.860
 I already have the first part 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:17.860
 Now I 'm going to put 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:23.630
 this washer with the bright already 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:27.290
 then I close it with the little ball 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.870
 Next step crown the crown here 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.970
 I've done with the same bit having a 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.460
 little hole to put 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.010
 then the leather tucked in there with a 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:41.430
 little bit of glue left the crown 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:44.600
 put and now I put 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:49.130
 this enzyme 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:52.340
 and this enzyme as you see me is left 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:55.370
 perfectly fit now and this 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:58.120
 I close it as I go 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.120
 liking 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.340
 once it's like this and before 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.280
 continue 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:08.720
 I'm going to hit the bottom part with a 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.730
 glue droplet 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:15.790
 of this super strong 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:19.120
 and another droplet here on the top 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.070
 so that I do not move, I have the little ball 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.570
 that I said but I here and now 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:26.210
 I have 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:30.020
 montaditos I put the pearls with a 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:32.570
 minimum separation between one and the other and the 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:38.810
 little piece of wood yesterday on that side 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:43.070
 then short wedge the cuerito you 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:46.350
 I put a drop of strong glue 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:51.240
 there at the tip at the end 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:53.190
 and I put it in that little hole that I have 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:57.630
 fact 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:05:01.230
 with the bit and now I put it on 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:04.000
 another little bit of glue gets in 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:09.780
 well liked here 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.780
 I will cut as little here at the tip 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:16.520
 so in the form of little points I paint him and a 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.900
 little bit of gold simulating that it's the 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:22.070
 nozzle 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:27.110
 once it's like this mess two or three 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:31.960
 times as they carry the cachina they go to cydia 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.960
 day when they are unused 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:40.449
 well once done the little tips in 

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:45.080
 golden here is the finished hookah 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:49.279
 ready to put it in my jaima forming 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:50.560
 part of that collection of miniatures that 

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:53.830
 will see 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:57.220
 inside them I hope that I have 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:06:00.460

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:03.500
