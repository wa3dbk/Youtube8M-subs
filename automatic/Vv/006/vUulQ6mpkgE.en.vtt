now<00:00:18.660> I<00:00:18.690> realized<00:00:19.109> each<00:00:19.410> player<00:00:19.650> does

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
now I realized each player does

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.529 
now I realized each player does
something<00:00:20.369> completely<00:00:20.939> different<00:00:21.119> for<00:00:21.420> their

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
something completely different for their

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.840 
something completely different for their
side<00:00:21.720> Luis<00:00:22.080> Suarez<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.500> not<00:00:23.070> only<00:00:23.220> creator<00:00:23.640> but

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
side Luis Suarez is not only creator but

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.160 
side Luis Suarez is not only creator but
he's<00:00:24.029> also<00:00:24.180> judge<00:00:24.510> would<00:00:24.689> score<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:24.990> all<00:00:25.050> the

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
he's also judge would score and all the

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.720 
he's also judge would score and all the
goals<00:00:25.320> while<00:00:25.650> Robin<00:00:26.039> van<00:00:26.160> Persie<00:00:26.220> actually

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
goals while Robin van Persie actually

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.189 
goals while Robin van Persie actually
has<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:26.910> carry<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.359> bulk<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.840> scoring

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
has to carry the bulk of the scoring

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.320 
has to carry the bulk of the scoring
alone<00:00:28.920> with<00:00:29.160> his<00:00:29.310> great<00:00:29.519> finishing<00:00:30.000> although

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
alone with his great finishing although

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.550 
alone with his great finishing although
there<00:00:30.539> are<00:00:30.599> two<00:00:30.689> totally<00:00:30.900> different<00:00:31.080> types<00:00:31.470> of

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
there are two totally different types of

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.799 
there are two totally different types of
striker<00:00:31.830> each<00:00:32.700> side<00:00:33.000> has<00:00:33.149> been<00:00:33.300> depended<00:00:33.690> upon

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
striker each side has been depended upon

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.139 
striker each side has been depended upon
them<00:00:34.380> for<00:00:35.010> points<00:00:35.309> this<00:00:35.399> season<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.880> mostly

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
them for points this season and mostly

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.250 
them for points this season and mostly
all<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.420> goals<00:00:36.630> I<00:00:36.840> don't<00:00:37.020> know<00:00:37.110> where

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
all the goals I don't know where

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.959 
all the goals I don't know where
manchester<00:00:37.739> united<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.340> liverpool<00:00:38.430> would<00:00:38.850> be

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
manchester united and liverpool would be

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.090 
manchester united and liverpool would be
without<00:00:39.210> Luis<00:00:39.600> Suarez<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.170> Robin<00:00:40.950> van<00:00:41.040> Persie

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
without Luis Suarez and Robin van Persie

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.069 
without Luis Suarez and Robin van Persie
but<00:00:41.610> it's<00:00:41.730> safe<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:41.879> say<00:00:42.059> they<00:00:42.450> would<00:00:42.570> not<00:00:42.809> be

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
but it's safe to say they would not be

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.750 
but it's safe to say they would not be
in<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.559> position<00:00:43.680> they<00:00:44.129> are<00:00:44.250> in<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.610> league

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
in the position they are in the league

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.639 
in the position they are in the league
without<00:00:45.149> them<00:00:45.600> now<00:00:45.840> what<00:00:46.079> I'm<00:00:46.170> going<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.320> do<00:00:46.440> is

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
without them now what I'm going to do is

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:47.869 
without them now what I'm going to do is

I'm gonna make my case for Robin van

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.060 
I'm gonna make my case for Robin van
Persie<00:00:51.329> actually<00:00:52.110> being<00:00:52.559> better<00:00:52.770> than<00:00:52.860> the

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
and I've got the facts to prove it

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.280 
and I've got the facts to prove it
starting<00:01:11.070> off<00:01:11.189> we<00:01:11.520> have<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:12.299> couple<00:01:12.780> key<00:01:12.930> areas

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
starting off we have a couple key areas

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.420 
starting off we have a couple key areas
that<00:01:13.470> I'm<00:01:13.560> looking<00:01:13.619> at<00:01:13.830> for<00:01:14.010> each<00:01:14.040> striker

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
that I'm looking at for each striker

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.789 
that I'm looking at for each striker
since<00:01:14.790> their<00:01:14.939> attackers<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:16.229> looked<00:01:16.619> at<00:01:16.710> their

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
since their attackers I looked at their

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.700 
since their attackers I looked at their
stats<00:01:17.009> on<00:01:17.159> EPL<00:01:17.490> index<00:01:17.820> calm<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.560> we<00:01:19.560> don't

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
stats on EPL index calm and we don't

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:20.840 
stats on EPL index calm and we don't
really<00:01:19.799> care<00:01:19.890> about<00:01:20.100> defensive<00:01:20.640> stats

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
really care about defensive stats

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.359 
really care about defensive stats
because<00:01:21.150> they're<00:01:21.540> not<00:01:21.720> defenders<00:01:22.619> they're

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
because they're not defenders they're

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.609 
because they're not defenders they're
passing<00:01:23.729> stats<00:01:23.909> are<00:01:24.150> basically<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.540> wash<00:01:24.780> so

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
passing stats are basically a wash so

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.640 
passing stats are basically a wash so
creativity<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.939> attacking<00:01:27.420> or<00:01:27.810> two<00:01:28.229> areas

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
creativity and attacking or two areas

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.289 
creativity and attacking or two areas
that<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:28.979> think<00:01:29.340> we<00:01:29.579> would<00:01:29.700> all<00:01:29.729> agree<00:01:29.850> are

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
that I think we would all agree are

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.270 
that I think we would all agree are
central<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.110> any<00:01:31.229> striker<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.860> any<00:01:32.009> attacker

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
central to any striker and any attacker

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.130

make<00:03:42.600> an<00:03:42.780> argument<00:03:42.920> fair<00:03:43.920> for<00:03:44.549> the<00:03:44.640> other<00:03:44.760> guy

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
make an argument fair for the other guy

think<00:03:57.989> it'd<00:03:58.079> be<00:03:58.230> safe<00:03:58.410> to<00:03:58.440> say<00:03:58.739> that<00:03:58.769> not<00:03:59.640> only

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670

is he better than Luis Suarez but second

is he better than Luis Suarez but second
of<00:04:02.880> Falcao<00:04:03.239> he's<00:04:03.510> probably<00:04:03.720> the<00:04:03.900> best<00:04:04.110> striker
