00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.080 
2,400 bucks all in Jane's looking pretty
good<00:01:40.409> but<00:01:40.920> when<00:01:41.040> we<00:01:41.159> calculate<00:01:41.460> out<00:01:41.790> her<00:01:41.909> net

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
good but when we calculate out her net

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.460 
good but when we calculate out her net
worth<00:01:42.119> we<00:01:42.540> take<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.869> four<00:01:43.110> hundred<00:01:43.409> and

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
worth we take the four hundred and

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.380 
worth we take the four hundred and
eighty-one<00:01:43.740> thousand<00:01:44.250> dollars<00:01:44.520> in<00:01:44.939> assets

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
eighty-one thousand dollars in assets

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.830 
eighty-one thousand dollars in assets
and<00:01:45.869> we<00:01:46.200> subtract<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:47.030> 314<00:01:48.030> 400<00:01:48.689> of

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
and we subtract the 314 400 of

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.310 
and we subtract the 314 400 of
liabilities<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.619> her<00:01:50.250> net<00:01:50.460> worth<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:51.320> 166

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
liabilities and her net worth is 166

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.560 
liabilities and her net worth is 166
thousand<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:52.950> six<00:01:53.250> hundred<00:01:53.549> dollars<00:01:53.579> so

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
thousand and six hundred dollars so

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.940 
thousand and six hundred dollars so
that's<00:01:54.810> how<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.020> calculate<00:01:55.229> your<00:01:55.560> net<00:01:55.619> worth

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
that's how you calculate your net worth

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.560 
that's how you calculate your net worth
and<00:01:56.159> it's<00:01:56.280> kind<00:01:56.430> of<00:01:56.460> like<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.670> snapshot<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.390> your

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
and it's kind of like a snapshot of your

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.109 
and it's kind of like a snapshot of your
financial<00:01:58.020> health<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.649> now<00:01:59.340> what<00:01:59.670> we<00:01:59.759> can<00:01:59.939> do

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
financial health and now what we can do

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.749 
financial health and now what we can do
we<00:02:00.719> can<00:02:00.750> actually<00:02:00.990> calculate<00:02:01.469> out<00:02:01.890> what<00:02:02.520> her

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
we can actually calculate out what her

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.389 
we can actually calculate out what her
net<00:02:03.000> worth<00:02:03.030> should<00:02:03.689> be<00:02:03.750> then<00:02:04.590> she<00:02:04.799> can<00:02:05.009> compare

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
net worth should be then she can compare

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.219 
net worth should be then she can compare
what<00:02:05.549> it<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:05.850> versus<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.689> where<00:02:06.810> she<00:02:06.960> should<00:02:07.020> be

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
what it is versus to where she should be

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.499 
what it is versus to where she should be
for<00:02:07.530> her<00:02:07.619> age<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:07.860> her<00:02:08.129> income<00:02:08.550> so<00:02:08.970> here's<00:02:09.300> the

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
for her age and her income so here's the

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.059 
for her age and her income so here's the
formula<00:02:09.840> for<00:02:10.020> how<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:10.379> figure<00:02:10.770> out<00:02:10.890> whether

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
formula for how you figure out whether

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.110 
formula for how you figure out whether
your<00:02:11.400> net<00:02:11.640> worth

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
your net worth

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.180 
your net worth
actually<00:02:12.510> up<00:02:12.659> to<00:02:12.690> snuff<00:02:13.080> with<00:02:13.379> your<00:02:13.650> age<00:02:13.830> and

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
actually up to snuff with your age and

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.610 
actually up to snuff with your age and
your<00:02:14.250> income<00:02:15.120> so<00:02:15.720> you<00:02:15.810> take<00:02:15.989> your<00:02:16.140> current<00:02:16.440> age

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
your income so you take your current age

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.460 
your income so you take your current age
minus<00:02:17.220> 27<00:02:17.819> and<00:02:18.000> you<00:02:18.569> multiply<00:02:18.720> it<00:02:19.080> by<00:02:19.200> your

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
minus 27 and you multiply it by your

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.280 
minus 27 and you multiply it by your
annual<00:02:19.920> pre-tax<00:02:20.370> income<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.900> you<00:02:21.989> take<00:02:22.170> the

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
annual pre-tax income and you take the

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.399 
annual pre-tax income and you take the
whole<00:02:22.470> number<00:02:22.799> and<00:02:23.010> you<00:02:23.129> divide<00:02:23.340> it<00:02:23.400> by<00:02:23.610> 5<00:02:23.849> so

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:24.409 
whole number and you divide it by 5 so

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:28.399 
whole number and you divide it by 5 so
with<00:02:25.409> Jane<00:02:25.769> she's<00:02:26.549> 40<00:02:26.940> years<00:02:27.000> old<00:02:27.269> so<00:02:27.780> we<00:02:27.870> do<00:02:28.019> 40

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
with Jane she's 40 years old so we do 40

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:31.160 
with Jane she's 40 years old so we do 40
minus<00:02:28.620> 27<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.519> she<00:02:30.180> makes<00:02:30.360> 70<00:02:30.750> thousand

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
minus 27 and she makes 70 thousand

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.050 
minus 27 and she makes 70 thousand
dollars<00:02:31.379> a<00:02:31.409> year<00:02:31.739> so<00:02:32.250> we<00:02:32.310> multiply<00:02:32.519> that<00:02:33.000> by

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
dollars a year so we multiply that by

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.479 
dollars a year so we multiply that by
seventy<00:02:33.720> thousand<00:02:34.110> dollars<00:02:34.409> and<00:02:34.680> then<00:02:35.190> divide

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
seventy thousand dollars and then divide

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.119 
seventy thousand dollars and then divide
by<00:02:35.519> five<00:02:35.970> her<00:02:36.540> net<00:02:36.840> worth<00:02:36.870> should<00:02:37.650> be<00:02:37.920> a

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
by five her net worth should be a

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:39.920 
by five her net worth should be a
hundred<00:02:38.459> and<00:02:38.700> eighty<00:02:38.879> two<00:02:39.090> thousand<00:02:39.599> dollars

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
hundred and eighty two thousand dollars

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.550 
hundred and eighty two thousand dollars
but<00:02:40.319> as<00:02:40.500> we<00:02:40.680> saw<00:02:40.920> her<00:02:41.549> net<00:02:41.760> worth<00:02:41.790> is<00:02:42.060> actually

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
but as we saw her net worth is actually

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.460 
but as we saw her net worth is actually
166<00:02:43.560> 600<00:02:44.549> so<00:02:45.239> she's<00:02:45.540> a<00:02:45.569> little<00:02:45.780> short<00:02:46.200> for

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
166 600 so she's a little short for

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.410 
166 600 so she's a little short for
where<00:02:46.769> she<00:02:46.950> should<00:02:47.160> be<00:02:47.340> given<00:02:47.700> her<00:02:47.849> age<00:02:48.060> and

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
where she should be given her age and

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.660 
where she should be given her age and
given<00:02:49.049> how<00:02:49.170> much<00:02:49.319> that<00:02:49.530> she<00:02:49.680> makes<00:02:49.890> so<00:02:50.400> James

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
given how much that she makes so James

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:51.800 
given how much that she makes so James
should<00:02:50.760> have<00:02:50.910> a<00:02:50.940> little<00:02:51.150> bit<00:02:51.390> more<00:02:51.540> in<00:02:51.690> her

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
should have a little bit more in her

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.809 
should have a little bit more in her
savings<00:02:52.170> account<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:52.769> a<00:02:52.980> little<00:02:53.280> bit<00:02:53.370> less<00:02:53.640> on

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
savings account and a little bit less on

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.640 
savings account and a little bit less on
her<00:02:53.940> liabilities<00:02:54.540> with<00:02:54.750> her<00:02:54.870> HELOC<00:02:55.260> and<00:02:55.530> her
