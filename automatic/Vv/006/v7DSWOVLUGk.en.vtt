pounds<00:00:39.270> less<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:40.290> would<00:00:40.379> bring<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.620> much

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
pounds less and that would bring it much

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.680 
pounds less and that would bring it much
closer<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.430> his<00:00:41.520> other<00:00:41.670> rivals<00:00:42.090> in<00:00:42.270> terms<00:00:42.540> of

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
closer to his other rivals in terms of

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.680 
closer to his other rivals in terms of
price<00:00:43.160> at<00:00:44.160> first<00:00:44.370> glance<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.000> Honda<00:00:45.450> I

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
price at first glance so the Honda I

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.410 
price at first glance so the Honda I
like<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.110> shape<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:47.070> wheels<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.879> then<00:00:48.390> I

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
like the shape the wheels and then I

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.880 
like the shape the wheels and then I
looked<00:00:48.809> at<00:00:48.960> again<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.530> thought<00:00:49.739> actually

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
looked at again and I thought actually

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.700 
looked at again and I thought actually
it<00:00:50.190> kind<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.399> looks<00:00:50.550> like<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.730> Prius<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:51.899> I'm<00:00:52.410> not

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
it kind of looks like a Prius so I'm not

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.130 
it kind of looks like a Prius so I'm not
really<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.160> big<00:00:53.340> fan<00:00:53.399> if<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.449> was<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.600> bit<00:00:54.840> lower

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
really a big fan if it was a bit lower

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.310 
really a big fan if it was a bit lower
and<00:00:55.760> it<00:00:56.760> would<00:00:56.879> look<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.030> lot<00:00:57.210> sportier<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:58.199> I

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
and it would look a lot sportier and I

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:06.609 
and it would look a lot sportier and I
think<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.649> would<00:00:58.770> look<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.190> lot<00:00:59.489> better

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.029 

the<00:01:07.579> interior<00:01:08.060> is<00:01:08.119> a<00:01:08.359> lot<00:01:08.659> better<00:01:08.929> than<00:01:09.109> the

00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:10.039 
the interior is a lot better than the

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:12.969 
the interior is a lot better than the
exterior<00:01:10.689> the<00:01:11.689> leather<00:01:11.929> trim<00:01:12.259> and<00:01:12.649> then<00:01:12.829> the

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
exterior the leather trim and then the

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.910 
exterior the leather trim and then the
silver<00:01:13.490> detailing<00:01:14.200> it<00:01:15.200> looks<00:01:15.409> quite<00:01:15.619> slick

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
silver detailing it looks quite slick

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.139 
silver detailing it looks quite slick
and<00:01:16.069> then<00:01:16.189> the<00:01:16.280> way<00:01:16.399> that<00:01:16.429> the<00:01:16.670> dash<00:01:16.850> comes

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
and then the way that the dash comes

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:20.980 
and then the way that the dash comes
across<00:01:17.679> and<00:01:18.679> the<00:01:19.219> sat-nav<00:01:19.460> system<00:01:20.149> is<00:01:20.359> good<00:01:20.840> as

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
across and the sat-nav system is good as

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.050 
across and the sat-nav system is good as
well<00:01:21.140> I<00:01:21.469> found<00:01:21.710> that<00:01:21.920> that<00:01:22.100> was<00:01:22.520> really<00:01:22.789> easy

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
well I found that that was really easy

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.330 
well I found that that was really easy
to<00:01:23.240> use<00:01:23.479> I<00:01:23.509> managed<00:01:24.049> to<00:01:24.079> use<00:01:24.319> it<00:01:24.469> first<00:01:24.709> time<00:01:24.979> I

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
to use I managed to use it first time I

to use I managed to use it first time I
do<00:01:25.880> find<00:01:26.299> that<00:01:26.390> the<00:01:26.509> keyless<00:01:27.049> feature<00:01:27.350> and<00:01:27.770> a

do find that the keyless feature and a

that is obvious and with the slits in
there<00:01:49.670> and<00:01:50.000> leather

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
there and leather

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.869 
there and leather
however<00:01:52.280> the<00:01:52.969> middle<00:01:53.420> and<00:01:53.750> seat<00:01:54.439> is<00:01:54.879> elevated

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:55.879 
however the middle and seat is elevated

00:01:55.879 --> 00:01:58.449 
however the middle and seat is elevated
so<00:01:56.090> it<00:01:56.569> would<00:01:56.810> make<00:01:56.989> a<00:01:57.020> good<00:01:57.349> four<00:01:57.739> seater<00:01:58.039> as

00:01:58.449 --> 00:01:58.459 
so it would make a good four seater as

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:02.619 
so it would make a good four seater as
opposed<00:01:58.849> to<00:01:58.969> five<00:01:59.479> seater<00:02:00.969> the<00:02:01.969> Honda's<00:02:02.390> boot

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:02.629 
opposed to five seater the Honda's boot

00:02:02.629 --> 00:02:05.050 
opposed to five seater the Honda's boot
is<00:02:02.810> massive<00:02:03.379> and<00:02:03.560> it<00:02:03.979> has<00:02:04.129> a<00:02:04.159> second<00:02:04.700> level

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
is massive and it has a second level

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.669 
is massive and it has a second level
where<00:02:05.209> you<00:02:05.329> can<00:02:05.450> put<00:02:05.689> your<00:02:05.840> food<00:02:06.079> shopping<00:02:06.379> and

where you can put your food shopping and

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:09.279 
where you can put your food shopping and

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
underneath them stop everything rolling

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.190 
underneath them stop everything rolling
around<00:02:09.679> which<00:02:09.769> i<00:02:09.860> think<00:02:09.950> is<00:02:10.129> a<00:02:10.160> nice<00:02:10.369> idea<00:02:11.200> also

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
around which i think is a nice idea also
