00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.879
 michelin the best way to move forward 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:23.310
 the most dangerous competitors will be 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.310
 you want soap and jordi arcarons 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.010
 with arcarons use one of the best 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.810
 strategies of my career because after 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.180
 of a few days of racing arcarons was still 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.640
 stepping on his heels he did not take any 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.610
 navigation initiative then I decided 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.750
 adopt a somewhat astute strategy 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.330
 ignoring it voluntarily and 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.150
 simulating a mechanical breakdown then 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.710
 he left alone I turned around and went 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.690
 to a place where there was a point of 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.360
 control pass the checkpoint and 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.040
 I continued the race at night comes to 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.140
 him and it turns out he skipped a point of 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.879
 control and received a penalty of three 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.199
 hours with which I put myself 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.199
 quietly at the head of the race 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.820
 I will not win the race with a 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.229
 claim but I will not lose the 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.830
 race for not fulfilling the 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:10.830
 regulation 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.300
 at 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.790
 in one stage my fall not even the bike 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.980
 it was little thing the footrest was a 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.390
 little crooked and in that moment we got to 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.910
 a control to a refreshment point 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.860
 of gasoline there were the televisions 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.560
 they asked me what was going on and I told them that 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.090
 I had fallen but that was fine 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.000
 there was a ravine and I did not see it I fell and I 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.710
 hit the head I asked the one who had 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.450
 organized the supplies I was 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.060
 I could leave a hammer to straighten 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.640
 slightly better my footrest on 13 in 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.470
 footrest and follow this very night 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.360
 arcarons files a claim because 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.430
 I used tools when I did not have to 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.770
 having done it then I received a 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.930
 penalty of not being 15 minutes what I 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.280
 relegated the second position 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.290
 It took me a day or two to recover a 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.510
 little and in the last days of the race 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.070
 and a stage that inspired me and then 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.440
 that day I decided to attack 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.570
 I ended up physically exhausted I arrived with a 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.160
 tire already without nails but I managed 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.620
 recover approximately 20 minutes 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.390
 arcarons and that was undoubtedly one of the 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.590
 stages in which more has been attacked in 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.590
 all my career actually
