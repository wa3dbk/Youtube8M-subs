easier scores out there and that's an

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.720 
easier scores out there and that's an

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
few minutes I think that he's worked on

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:37.870 
few minutes I think that he's worked on
the<00:02:36.590> shooting<00:02:37.010> I<00:02:37.130> think<00:02:37.160> good<00:02:37.489> Sullivan

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
the shooting I think good Sullivan

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.320 
the shooting I think good Sullivan
shootings<00:02:38.239> looked<00:02:38.959> ok<00:02:39.440> at<00:02:39.560> times<00:02:39.830> today<00:02:40.330> the

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
shootings looked ok at times today the

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.300 
shootings looked ok at times today the
arts<00:02:41.599> trying<00:02:42.380> to<00:02:42.500> convince<00:02:42.769> him<00:02:42.980> and<00:02:43.130> take

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
arts trying to convince him and take

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.800 
arts trying to convince him and take
over<00:02:43.489> shots<00:02:43.910> when<00:02:44.269> he<00:02:44.360> had<00:02:44.510> open<00:02:44.840> shots<00:02:45.250> books

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
over shots when he had open shots books

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.660 
over shots when he had open shots books
were<00:02:47.810> pretty<00:02:48.080> good<00:02:48.260> and<00:02:49.099> I<00:02:49.250> thought<00:02:49.400> that<00:02:49.459> he

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
were pretty good and I thought that he

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.160 
were pretty good and I thought that he
tried<00:02:49.910> to<00:02:49.940> heal<00:02:50.269> maybe<00:02:50.450> advance<00:02:50.810> the<00:02:51.019> ball

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
tried to heal maybe advance the ball

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.009 
tried to heal maybe advance the ball
over<00:02:51.380> too<00:02:51.680> far<00:02:51.709> times<00:02:52.370> on<00:02:53.000> sequences<00:02:53.750> have<00:02:53.840> got

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
over too far times on sequences have got

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.259 
over too far times on sequences have got
himself<00:02:54.170> in<00:02:54.560> the<00:02:54.739> midst<00:02:55.670> of<00:02:55.730> very<00:02:55.970> tall

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
himself in the midst of very tall

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.059 
himself in the midst of very tall
athletic<00:02:56.540> guys<00:02:57.200> that<00:02:57.500> were<00:02:57.590> difficult<00:02:57.830> to

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
athletic guys that were difficult to

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:59.830 
athletic guys that were difficult to
finish<00:02:58.430> so<00:02:58.910> what<00:02:59.420> you're<00:02:59.569> talking<00:02:59.750> about

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
finish so what you're talking about

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.300 
finish so what you're talking about
something<00:03:00.080> got<00:03:00.440> with<00:03:00.709> a<00:03:00.950> little<00:03:01.130> bit<00:03:01.250> of

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
something got with a little bit of

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.880 
something got with a little bit of
confidence<00:03:01.970> problem<00:03:02.450> no<00:03:02.930> I<00:03:02.959> think<00:03:03.440> it's<00:03:03.739> a

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
confidence problem no I think it's a

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.349 
confidence problem no I think it's a
rhythm<00:03:04.370> problem<00:03:04.730> more<00:03:04.940> than<00:03:05.000> anything<00:03:05.209> else

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:05.359 
rhythm problem more than anything else

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:07.420 
rhythm problem more than anything else
just<00:03:05.690> a<00:03:05.900> lack<00:03:06.200> of<00:03:06.230> playing<00:03:06.650> the<00:03:06.920> last<00:03:07.040> what

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
just a lack of playing the last what

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.150 
just a lack of playing the last what
month<00:03:07.700> or<00:03:07.910> so<00:03:08.060> just<00:03:08.299> consistent<00:03:09.019> play<00:03:09.200> so<00:03:10.130> I

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
month or so just consistent play so I

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.059 
month or so just consistent play so I
think<00:03:10.670> he'll<00:03:10.910> come<00:03:11.120> through<00:03:11.799> Kevin<00:03:12.799> Durant

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
think he'll come through Kevin Durant

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:14.380 
think he'll come through Kevin Durant
had<00:03:13.250> a<00:03:13.280> really<00:03:13.430> rough<00:03:13.640> night<00:03:13.880> from<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.150> field

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
had a really rough night from the field

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.569 
had a really rough night from the field
which<00:03:14.930> isn't<00:03:15.230> typical<00:03:15.620> for<00:03:15.769> him<00:03:15.890> how<00:03:16.370> much<00:03:16.549> of

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
which isn't typical for him how much of

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:18.340 
which isn't typical for him how much of
that<00:03:16.730> was<00:03:16.850> a<00:03:17.090> team<00:03:17.450> effort<00:03:17.569> with<00:03:17.959> schemed<00:03:18.260> and

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
that was a team effort with schemed and

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:19.720 
that was a team effort with schemed and
everything<00:03:18.709> and<00:03:18.799> how<00:03:18.890> much<00:03:19.040> of<00:03:19.100> that<00:03:19.250> with<00:03:19.549> Ron

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
everything and how much of that with Ron

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.229 
everything and how much of that with Ron
Artest<00:03:20.440> individually<00:03:21.760> fighting<00:03:22.760> the<00:03:22.819> defense

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
Artest individually fighting the defense

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.150 
Artest individually fighting the defense
well<00:03:23.600> I<00:03:23.630> thought<00:03:23.810> the<00:03:23.870> team<00:03:24.560> was<00:03:24.709> much<00:03:24.950> more

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
well I thought the team was much more
