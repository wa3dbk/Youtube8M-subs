everyday and cryptic horns a very easy
plant<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.930> grow<00:01:28.020> I've<00:01:28.500> never<00:01:28.950> had<00:01:29.189> problems

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
plant to grow I've never had problems

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.899 
plant to grow I've never had problems
with<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.820> before<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.659> this<00:01:31.560> co2<00:01:31.950> booster<00:01:32.670> stuff

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
with it before so this co2 booster stuff

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.280 
with it before so this co2 booster stuff
is<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.869> only<00:01:33.990> thing<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.320> can<00:01:34.530> really<00:01:35.250> explain

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
is the only thing I can really explain

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.080 
is the only thing I can really explain
you<00:01:37.290> know<00:01:37.409> what's<00:01:37.680> killing<00:01:38.040> what's<00:01:38.700> killing

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
you know what's killing what's killing

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.910 
you know what's killing what's killing
this<00:01:39.240> plant<00:01:39.570> all<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.290> other<00:01:40.409> plants<00:01:40.770> seem

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
this plant all the other plants seem

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.580 
this plant all the other plants seem
unaffected<00:01:41.220> so<00:01:42.030> I'm<00:01:42.990> not<00:01:43.140> sure<00:01:43.350> why<00:01:43.530> the

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
unaffected so I'm not sure why the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.889 
unaffected so I'm not sure why the
crypts<00:01:44.040> are<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.729> know<00:01:44.850> melting<00:01:45.329> away<00:01:45.420> because

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
crypts are you know melting away because

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.690 
crypts are you know melting away because
of<00:01:46.020> this<00:01:46.110> stuff<00:01:46.380> but<00:01:47.009> anyway<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.310> thought<00:01:47.549> it

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
of this stuff but anyway I thought it

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.420 
of this stuff but anyway I thought it
would<00:01:48.470> be<00:01:49.470> good<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.680> let<00:01:49.920> other<00:01:50.100> people<00:01:50.399> know

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
would be good to let other people know

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.710 
would be good to let other people know
this<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.720> it'd<00:01:52.409> be<00:01:52.439> good<00:01:53.189> if<00:01:53.390> other<00:01:54.390> people

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
this and it'd be good if other people

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.260 
this and it'd be good if other people
could<00:01:54.869> share<00:01:55.110> their<00:01:55.290> experiences<00:01:56.040> of<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.909> co2

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
could share their experiences of the co2

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.539 
could share their experiences of the co2
