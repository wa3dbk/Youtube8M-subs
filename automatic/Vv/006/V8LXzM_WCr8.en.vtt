virtually<00:01:10.460> smoke<00:01:10.729> free<00:01:11.030> which<00:01:11.240> means<00:01:11.420> you<00:01:11.690> can

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
virtually smoke free which means you can

much purer product it's basically just

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.580 
much purer product it's basically just
carbon<00:01:20.030> and<00:01:20.240> therefore<00:01:20.899> it<00:01:20.990> can<00:01:21.110> be<00:01:21.229> used<00:01:21.439> for

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.830 

down<00:04:34.070> in<00:04:34.250> the<00:04:34.370> woods<00:04:34.580> it's<00:04:34.910> difficult<00:04:35.510> to<00:04:35.690> know

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
down in the woods it's difficult to know

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.780 
down in the woods it's difficult to know
how<00:04:36.020> successful<00:04:36.080> the<00:04:36.830> charcoal<00:04:37.250> burning<00:04:37.550> has

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
how successful the charcoal burning has

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.180 
how successful the charcoal burning has
been<00:04:38.140> there's<00:04:39.140> only<00:04:39.260> one<00:04:39.530> way<00:04:39.680> to<00:04:39.710> tell<00:04:40.010> for

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
been there's only one way to tell for

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.550 
been there's only one way to tell for
sure<00:04:40.480> crack<00:04:41.480> it<00:04:41.630> open<00:04:41.780> and<00:04:42.080> see<00:04:42.350> how<00:04:42.440> much

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
sure crack it open and see how much

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.310 
sure crack it open and see how much
charcoal<00:04:43.010> is<00:04:43.160> inside

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
charcoal is inside

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.750 
charcoal is inside
oh<00:04:45.350> good<00:04:45.710> that's<00:04:45.830> really<00:04:46.250> brilliant<00:04:46.370> stuff

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
oh good that's really brilliant stuff

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.480 
oh good that's really brilliant stuff
there<00:04:47.000> a<00:04:47.210> fire<00:04:47.810> is<00:04:48.020> basically<00:04:48.380> gone<00:04:48.710> out<00:04:48.890> and

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
there a fire is basically gone out and

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.870 
there a fire is basically gone out and
the<00:04:49.640> heaps<00:04:49.790> cooled<00:04:50.150> down<00:04:51.280> there<00:04:52.280> are<00:04:52.370> few<00:04:52.610> bits

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
the heaps cooled down there are few bits

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.530 
the heaps cooled down there are few bits
that<00:04:53.060> are<00:04:53.180> still<00:04:53.500> brown<00:04:54.500> not<00:04:55.100> black<00:04:55.390> but<00:04:56.390> this

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
that are still brown not black but this

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.120 
that are still brown not black but this
isn't<00:04:56.690> wasted<00:04:57.230> all<00:04:57.380> that<00:04:57.590> would<00:04:57.710> happen<00:04:58.010> is<00:04:58.070> a

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
isn't wasted all that would happen is a

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.650 
isn't wasted all that would happen is a
real<00:04:58.340> charcoal<00:04:58.820> burner<00:04:59.060> would<00:04:59.270> take<00:04:59.510> these

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
real charcoal burner would take these

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.600 
real charcoal burner would take these
half<00:04:59.900> burnt<00:05:00.230> bits<00:05:00.530> and<00:05:01.100> put<00:05:01.280> them<00:05:01.400> straight

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
half burnt bits and put them straight

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.090 
half burnt bits and put them straight
back<00:05:01.850> into<00:05:02.120> the<00:05:02.210> next<00:05:02.510> burn<00:05:03.080> oh<00:05:03.350> look<00:05:03.890> at<00:05:04.010> this

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
back into the next burn oh look at this

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.160 
back into the next burn oh look at this
bit<00:05:04.280> that's<00:05:05.270> just<00:05:05.390> beautiful<00:05:05.720> there's<00:05:06.110> no

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.170 
bit that's just beautiful there's no

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.760 
bit that's just beautiful there's no

boys at the time would have been

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.960 
boys at the time would have been
producing<00:05:16.040> much<00:05:16.250> more<00:05:16.460> efficiently<00:05:16.820> they'd

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
producing much more efficiently they'd

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.540

have<00:05:17.090> had<00:05:17.240> maybe<00:05:17.420> 90%<00:05:17.900> plus<00:05:18.350> of<00:05:18.770> good<00:05:19.010> charcoal

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
have had maybe 90% plus of good charcoal

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:20.470 
have had maybe 90% plus of good charcoal
