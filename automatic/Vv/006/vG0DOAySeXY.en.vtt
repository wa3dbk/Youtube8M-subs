high<00:02:49.260> e<00:02:49.290> all<00:02:50.070> the<00:02:50.130> way<00:02:50.340> down<00:02:50.550> so<00:02:51.330> it'll<00:02:51.510> be<00:02:51.660> 9<00:02:52.530> 10

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
high e all the way down so it'll be 9 10

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.650 
high e all the way down so it'll be 9 10
11<00:02:54.000> 12

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
11 12

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.170 
11 12
and<00:02:57.660> then<00:02:57.900> on<00:02:58.020> that<00:02:58.170> D<00:02:58.380> string<00:02:58.650> still<00:02:59.900> 11<00:03:00.900> and

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
and then on that D string still 11 and

00:03:02.180 --> 00:06:12.860 
and then on that D string still 11 and
then<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.570> really<00:03:03.750> again<00:03:04.110> back<00:03:04.410> to<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:04.680> root

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.150 

so<00:06:13.870> the<00:06:13.990> idea<00:06:14.230> is<00:06:14.320> when<00:06:14.500> you<00:06:14.530> learn<00:06:14.770> little

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:15.160 
so the idea is when you learn little

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.000 
so the idea is when you learn little
phrases<00:06:15.430> and<00:06:15.760> legs<00:06:16.030> is<00:06:16.270> to<00:06:16.560> incorporate<00:06:17.560> them

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.010 
phrases and legs is to incorporate them

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.640 
phrases and legs is to incorporate them
into<00:06:18.190> you<00:06:18.820> know<00:06:18.940> you're<00:06:19.150> improvising<00:06:19.650> switch

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:20.650 
into you know you're improvising switch

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.010 
into you know you're improvising switch
them<00:06:20.830> around<00:06:20.950> and<00:06:21.520> the<00:06:22.240> idea<00:06:22.540> is<00:06:22.630> that<00:06:22.660> you

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.020 
them around and the idea is that you

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.870 
them around and the idea is that you
know<00:06:23.140> if<00:06:23.260> you've<00:06:23.440> practiced<00:06:23.950> it<00:06:24.130> enough<00:06:24.220> you

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880 
know if you've practiced it enough you

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.909 
know if you've practiced it enough you
can<00:06:25.060> make<00:06:25.270> it<00:06:25.419> your<00:06:25.570> own<00:06:25.600> lick<00:06:26.080> instead<00:06:26.710> of<00:06:26.830> it

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:26.919 
can make it your own lick instead of it
