00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
theory I have I think there might be a

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.010 
theory I have I think there might be a
correlation<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.510> haven't<00:00:39.780> done<00:00:39.899> enough

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
correlation I haven't done enough

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.410 
correlation I haven't done enough
research<00:00:40.440> but<00:00:41.129> there's<00:00:41.399> something<00:00:41.850> about<00:00:42.270> it

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
research but there's something about it

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.240 
research but there's something about it
that<00:00:42.450> bugs<00:00:42.840> me<00:00:42.960> okay<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.350> have<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:43.770> crazy

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
that bugs me okay I have this crazy

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.920 
that bugs me okay I have this crazy
theory<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.090> don't<00:00:45.360> think<00:00:45.510> it's<00:00:45.629> all<00:00:45.750> that

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
theory that I don't think it's all that

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.979 
theory that I don't think it's all that
crazy<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.070> lease<00:00:47.719> can't<00:00:48.719> play<00:00:48.960> defense

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
crazy that the lease can't play defense

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.760 
crazy that the lease can't play defense
but<00:00:49.890> but<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.730> trade-off<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.629> their<00:00:52.230> offense

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
but but the trade-off is their offense

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.250 
but but the trade-off is their offense
is<00:00:53.010> bananas<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.000> when<00:00:54.329> offense<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:55.079> all

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
is bananas and when offense is all

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.470 
is bananas and when offense is all
they're<00:00:55.469> focusing<00:00:56.010> on<00:00:56.190> they<00:00:56.760> kick<00:00:57.000> ass<00:00:57.210> the

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
they're focusing on they kick ass the

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.180 
they're focusing on they kick ass the
second<00:00:57.809> they<00:00:57.870> even<00:00:58.170> attempt<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.710> crawl<00:00:58.980> into<00:00:59.129> a

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190

two<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.299> them<00:01:18.420> came<00:01:18.689> in<00:01:18.840> this<00:01:18.960> game<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.229> thought

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
two of them came in this game I thought

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.289 
two of them came in this game I thought
the<00:01:20.070> Leafs<00:01:20.250> had<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.430> great<00:01:20.670> first<00:01:20.880> period

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
the Leafs had a great first period

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.880 
the Leafs had a great first period
unfortunately<00:01:21.930> on<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.200> season<00:01:22.710> they've

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
unfortunately on the season they've

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.300 
unfortunately on the season they've
allowed<00:01:23.130> 54<00:01:23.970> which<00:01:24.240> makes<00:01:24.570> them<00:01:24.869> negative<00:01:25.500> 13

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
allowed 54 which makes them negative 13

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.249 
allowed 54 which makes them negative 13
in<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.759> first<00:01:27.000> period<00:01:27.270> so<00:01:27.540> far<00:01:27.750> this<00:01:27.900> year

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
in the first period so far this year

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.469 
in the first period so far this year
second<00:01:28.770> periods<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.250> moneymaker<00:01:29.579> seventy

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
second periods the moneymaker seventy

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.620 
second periods the moneymaker seventy
three<00:01:31.020> goals<00:01:31.409> for<00:01:31.790> 61<00:01:32.790> games<00:01:33.030> which<00:01:33.299> is<00:01:33.479> not

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
three goals for 61 games which is not

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.219 
three goals for 61 games which is not
good<00:01:33.990> but<00:01:34.500> plus<00:01:35.100> 12<00:01:35.520> third<00:01:35.880> period<00:01:36.390> 66<00:01:37.140> for

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
good but plus 12 third period 66 for

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.730 
good but plus 12 third period 66 for
pretty<00:01:37.829> good<00:01:38.070> 75<00:01:39.170> against<00:01:40.170> now<00:01:40.350> here's<00:01:40.590> the

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
pretty good 75 against now here's the

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.289 
pretty good 75 against now here's the
part<00:01:40.890> that<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.100> think<00:01:41.189> supports<00:01:41.790> my<00:01:41.909> theory<00:01:42.210> the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
part that I think supports my theory the

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.810 
part that I think supports my theory the
66<00:01:42.899> third<00:01:43.229> period<00:01:43.680> goals<00:01:43.890> for<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.520> Leafs<00:01:44.700> that

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
66 third period goals for the Leafs that

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.389 
66 third period goals for the Leafs that
I<00:01:44.939> mentioned<00:01:45.390> is<00:01:45.540> sixth<00:01:46.049> in<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.470> entire<00:01:46.829> NHL

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
I mentioned is sixth in the entire NHL

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.160 
I mentioned is sixth in the entire NHL
that's<00:01:47.729> pretty<00:01:48.060> good<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.540> teams<00:01:48.780> ahead<00:01:48.930> of

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
that's pretty good the teams ahead of

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.130 
that's pretty good the teams ahead of
them<00:01:49.290> are<00:01:49.500> Pittsburgh<00:01:49.979> st.<00:01:50.250> Louis<00:01:50.640> Chicago

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
Philadelphia and Boston

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.859 
Philadelphia and Boston
most<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.490> those<00:01:53.610> are<00:01:53.820> pretty<00:01:54.060> good<00:01:54.299> teams<00:01:54.600> the

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
most of those are pretty good teams the

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.020 
most of those are pretty good teams the
75<00:01:55.409> they've<00:01:55.619> given<00:01:55.950> up<00:01:56.130> in<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.369> third<00:01:56.610> is<00:01:56.850> the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
75 they've given up in the third is the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.109 
75 they've given up in the third is the
second<00:01:57.659> worst<00:01:58.259> in<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.860> NHL<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.579> Islanders

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
second worst in the NHL the Islanders

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.639 
second worst in the NHL the Islanders
are<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.360> only<00:02:00.509> team<00:02:00.750> that's<00:02:00.960> worse<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.469> the

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
are the only team that's worse and the

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.410 
are the only team that's worse and the
Islanders<00:02:02.130> have<00:02:02.310> played<00:02:02.520> one<00:02:02.850> more<00:02:03.060> game<00:02:03.390> than

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
Islanders have played one more game than

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.600 
Islanders have played one more game than
the<00:02:03.780> Leafs<00:02:03.990> so<00:02:04.170> it's<00:02:04.320> possible<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:05.250> Leafs<00:02:05.460> are

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
the Leafs so it's possible the Leafs are

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.100 
the Leafs so it's possible the Leafs are
the<00:02:05.700> worst<00:02:05.939> third<00:02:06.240> period<00:02:06.689> team<00:02:06.869> in<00:02:07.020> the

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
the worst third period team in the

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.139 
the worst third period team in the
league<00:02:07.290> in<00:02:07.500> terms<00:02:08.009> of<00:02:08.220> allowing<00:02:08.429> goals<00:02:08.849> so<00:02:09.060> how

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
league in terms of allowing goals so how

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.669 
league in terms of allowing goals so how
does<00:02:09.209> this<00:02:09.450> support<00:02:09.599> my<00:02:09.899> theory<00:02:10.110> in<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.440> third

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
does this support my theory in the third

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.400 
does this support my theory in the third
period<00:02:10.920> when<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.370> Leafs<00:02:11.550> are<00:02:11.730> down

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
period when the Leafs are down

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.020 
period when the Leafs are down

I<00:06:09.620> don't<00:06:09.800> like<00:06:09.919> goons<00:06:10.250> in<00:06:10.729> the<00:06:10.910> lineup<00:06:11.150> but

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.930 
I don't like goons in the lineup but

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.409 
I don't like goons in the lineup but
fights<00:06:12.830> are<00:06:13.010> so<00:06:13.160> entertaining<00:06:13.580> sometimes<00:06:14.210> a

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:14.419

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:16.340 
lot of staged fights sucking and boring

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:17.830 
lot of staged fights sucking and boring

thrown<00:06:18.080> but<00:06:18.260> this<00:06:18.410> one<00:06:18.620> was<00:06:18.800> bombs<00:06:19.190> but<00:06:19.610> more

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:19.850 
thrown but this one was bombs but more

in<00:06:40.270> front<00:06:40.539> I<00:06:40.629> think<00:06:40.960> it<00:06:41.080> was<00:06:41.199> early<00:06:41.590> in<00:06:41.620> the

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:41.710 
in front I think it was early in the

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.770

third<00:06:41.860> in<00:06:42.430> other<00:06:42.580> words<00:06:42.789> I<00:06:43.000> noticed<00:06:43.509> Fraser

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:43.780 
third in other words I noticed Fraser

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.129 
third in other words I noticed Fraser
McLaren<00:06:44.319> in<00:06:44.500> a<00:06:44.650> positive<00:06:45.310> way<00:06:45.550> three<00:06:46.360> times<00:06:46.780> in

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:47.139 
McLaren in a positive way three times in

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:49.439 
McLaren in a positive way three times in
two<00:06:47.349> minutes<00:06:47.740> and<00:06:47.979> seven<00:06:48.460> seconds<00:06:48.879> of<00:06:49.000> ice<00:06:49.150> and

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:49.449 
two minutes and seven seconds of ice and

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:51.029 
two minutes and seven seconds of ice and
I<00:06:49.569> think<00:06:49.870> he<00:06:49.960> got<00:06:50.080> into<00:06:50.259> that<00:06:50.409> fight<00:06:50.710> with<00:06:50.860> Rose

00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:51.039 
I think he got into that fight with Rose

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:52.680 
I think he got into that fight with Rose
Hill<00:06:51.280> because<00:06:51.520> that's<00:06:51.759> what's<00:06:52.030> expected<00:06:52.300> of
