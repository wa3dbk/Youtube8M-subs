This is Betsy from Classroom Caboodle.

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:06.029
Today I’m going to show you a great way
for students to summarize their thinking about

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.120
a fiction book.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.110
All right.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:22.699
So, we all teach students how to write a great
summary about a fiction text that they have

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:29.400
read, and I decided I wanted my students to
be able to do that in a big, splashy way.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.390
So I created...whoops!

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.460
Sorry.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.420
I created my reading reflection poster.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.550
This is after you’ve taught students how
to write a summary, and it’s a creative

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.789
way for them to be able to share their thinking.

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:52.920
It includes main idea, character, setting,
the problem, the solution, and of course,

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:53.920
the main idea.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.860
They get to draw the top of the cover of the
book with the title and author, they can tell

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:04.250
a little bit about the plot, and then I added
that part where students get to go over their

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.510
personal responses, their connections, and
their emotions that they felt when reading

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.610
the text.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.630
Of course, students like to be able to give
their opinion, too; so here, they can rate

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.040
it like they would for a book review.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.200
This is a great tool also for students to
use as a presentation in the classroom in

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.200
front of others because we all know that students
need to practice their communication skills,

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.960
so they can use this for presentation.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.680
I have this available on Teachers Pay Teachers
in my Classroom Caboodle store, so you can

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.110
go there and purchase it.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.290
I have an example for you also.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:50.060
You’ll be able to see in this video what
it looks like when a student completes a reading

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.670
reflection poster.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:59.110
This is a smaller size that students could
keep in a binder or a folder as well so they

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.820
could refer back to it.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.790
But this is just one great way for students
to show that they understand about a fiction

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:36.910
book that they’ve read.
