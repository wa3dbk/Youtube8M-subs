00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hi what about youtuber friends 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.490
 welcome to a new video tutorial on 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.500
 which we will learn how to do in 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.690
 fast camera or slow motion to our 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.090
 videos on what would be the 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.860
 software vegas pro or sony vegas like 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.450
 want to call it good, so first thing 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.940
 what we have to do is have a video 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.140
 in the time area on our line 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.640
 of the time it would be this 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.130
 down here as you can see here I have the 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.140
 video and I'll show you what the 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.140
 normal camera that there is normal video 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.200
 well now what we will do first will be 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.940
 do it in slow motion which for 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.970
 to do it we need to position our 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.470
 cursor here on the edge of the video as 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.050
 you may realize they appear two 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.170
 to both sides to it 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.440
 we will press control 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.899
 to compress the thread time and with the 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.149
 same cursor we will click and we will pass it 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:56.180
 towards the left side that as well as 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:58.370
 compressing this will now give you a 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.640
 effect as if it were faster or in 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.789
 fast camera no ok already compress it 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.360
 now the reproducible so they can 

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:07.360
 realize 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.250
 As you can tell, it goes faster 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.590
 that a moment ago 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.210
 that's the effect we just had 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:25.090
 give ok now what we do will be 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.960
 slow it down in slow motion 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.670
 for it in the same way 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.250
 We position the course hours on the shore 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.250
 we press the 'key' control to 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.680
 compress the time or extend it in this 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.440
 case we are going to extend we are going to click 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:43.310
 on the same shore and we are going to stretch 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.740
 towards the right side than to do the 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.110
 Slow motion effect, I'm going to 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.759
 make a little elongated more or less 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.060
 around here so you can appreciate that 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.880
 it's too slow 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.320
 what am I going to give play and how can they be given 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.600
 account 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.100
 Now he goes in slow motion 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.390
 I do not know if you can hear the voice 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.390
 also in slow motion 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.520
 good 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.410
 so in the same way 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.660
 remember let's position it towards the 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.670
 left for fast camera or the 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.300
 right to lengthen it and become a camera 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.370
 slow 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.230
 Well, that was everything, I hope 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.950
 has served any doubt or 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:28.480
 comment already know there abajito and up 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.480
 the next I hope I have helped you
