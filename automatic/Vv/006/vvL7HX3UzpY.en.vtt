00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.879
 [Applause] 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.140
 a puppy that has 2 osteochondritis 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.910
 dissecting in the medial part of the cone 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:38.570
 of the middle humerus of both elbows 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:41.840
 It's worth that, it seems it's that 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:44.240
 cartilage nutrition 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.400
 and it goes on one side from the arteries of 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.040
 metaphysics and it goes down to the depth 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:52.100
 of cartilage and what you do not notice in these 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.140
 business arts we will be broadcast to 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.870
 through the cartilage then yes 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.780
 in between is not nourished at all there is a 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:03.390
 area that is necrosa and is called this with 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.550
 dose when that piece of micro system 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.990
 sexual you loose all the piece of 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.580
 cartilage that dies that piece of 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.080
 loose songs that you called back and 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.040
 sense sing 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.040
 and there is more 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.630
 well now courageous we continue 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.630
 tendons usually take 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.600
 ah 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:37.270
 I compete dissecting and is frequent in 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.060
 the elbow in the medial part of the condyle 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.270
 of the number but it is also permanent in 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.040
 three other sites that are the shoulder in 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.080
 the caudal part in the part number 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.540
 this flow has new forecast 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.570
 remove the flag and the dogs go quite 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:55.000
 well also in the lateral medial part 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.560
 with the money of the femur is usually the 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.869
 most frequent lateral but can also 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.600
 be the average and in the astragalus in the 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.850
 tarso is worth then they are when we 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.100
 we have an animal that is the goose rite 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.020
 what we do is go find that 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.880
 disease instead of that disease 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.610
 surprise us already with a lot of osteoarthritis 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.470
 Alava that limps we have the diseases 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.480
 that can produce that catch and this one that 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.370
 is the one of the diseases of the 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.170
 elbow dysplasia we have to go to 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.450
 look for it and what you see in the 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.170
 radiography is that you have to have a 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.850
 rounded outline and suddenly it has 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.410
 a notch has a music that looks 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.030
 pretty good on x-rays and not 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.070
 it looks good on national radio 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.230
 individual in the dozen yes although to what 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.550
 better is not sensitive enough 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.860
 the radiological then it would be that 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.890
 send it to do a scanner a tag that 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.220
 tell you exactly if you have no luck and 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:49.440
 how deep is the bad is the 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.440
 cicatricial bone reaction 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.880
 [Music] 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.480
 while you have no light 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:19.370
 this bit of here was crowned and of a 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.370
 idea that seems to be fragmented 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.820
 [Music] 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.820
 I stop 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:33.290
 that is the third way idea fragments 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.060
 and normally that little corner is 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.590
 the one that normally ss ss but you have 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.240
 that splinter 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.470
 I'm doing curettage 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.539
 of the acb 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.539
 [Music] 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.990
 that basically consisting of removing 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:53.190
 the cartilage of the covers is all 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:55.510
 cartilage if all the subchondral bone 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.560
 until we reach the area that is 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.010
 where he bleeds 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.160
 so that a fiber or cartilage forms 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.160
 [Music] 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.320
 come to catch
