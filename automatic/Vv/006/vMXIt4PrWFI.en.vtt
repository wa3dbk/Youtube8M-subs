00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.690
 I just cleaned up a bit 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.100
 this is the kitchen as you see it 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.850
 which actually has a 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:10.460
 dishwasher and oven so really just fine 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.770
 then here is the dining table and there I sit 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.030
 also to work on and i have so beautiful 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.390
 view is that very beautiful 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.390
 of course 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.250
 television and a sitting area we have 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.110
 actually two apartments are with 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.070
 a group of ten people and at the 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.750
 on the other hand also have one 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.770
 apartment and there we are 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.899
 mainly 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.240
 also have a balcony here and i have 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:33.170
 the view from the balcony too 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.530
 show you all 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:39.470
 and look who we have there 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.180
 okay okay 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.740
 also prefer cozy you will find this too 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.289
 fun can suddenly become a bit pathetic because 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.539
 he is limping from Saturday 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:49.310
 Anyway we called the vet 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:51.140
 and he said it probably wasn't 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.119
 very serious because he does it anyway 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.369
 leg still used occasionally 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.690
 so that's a little see over there 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.940
 as you can see I can do pretty well 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.940
 jump and so on kiki week cookie 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.759

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.039
 snow on vacation I'm just doing it 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.649
 work because I have not worked out for it 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:12.620
 he already do that on vacation it 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.050
 it is a shame that my laptop suddenly breaks down 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.360
 has gone and that was already the case in Italy 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.290
 and now again so I really have the idea that 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.150

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.250

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.480
 so they themselves present a hair dryer I use 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.520

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.950
 the dolls could do with a lot less 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.690
 sums to magistrum but a fossil 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.140
 with fallen and snow still one 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.290
 bit 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.790

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.990

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:46.690

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.930

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.250
 and maybe follow me 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:56.340
 such a cabin can pass 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.780
 walk there somewhere the elevator is a tot 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.190

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.820
 to show you all that I have in my 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.500
 toilet bag 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.210
 between them have to makeup and 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.650
 care products 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.600

 very handy for that you can 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.530
 use your body for your face 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.420
 but also for your hair and a primer and 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.860
 I just realized that I am mine 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.940
 so my facial products 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.780
 cleaning products are in the 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.090

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.120
 very handy for traveling with it 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.740
 is just a very small bottle so take it 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.180

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.350
 this is home and very nice scent and 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.950

 three your foundations most like you 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 but I mix this with each other so if 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.560
 I want more coverage than I go for 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.990
 these two in that I mix that together 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.479
 is the bourgeois flower perfection and the 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.280
 bourjois healthy mix and this is the bb 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:13.470
 cream from carl and which I myself very fine 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.850
 find and use it if I just what 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.310
 less coverage mail 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.650
 I still have a few plus prime powder 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.320

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.270
 powder and two more vans from mac and this 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.340
 is the color 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:28.680
 supernova so mineralize blush and this is it 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.729

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.470

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:33.450

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.590
 I find longwear concealer myself 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.540
 very nice 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.380
 I'm perhaps a review on 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.820
 write 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.490
 and I have a nice highlighter with me 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:43.260
 and this is the powder and the powder 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.810
 java from bourjois and searching for 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.340
 loose powder I also have a lip here 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.250
 products and this is the bubblegum 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.870
 lush lip scrub and a vaseline 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.400
 pink bubbly yes I find this very much 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.220
 nice if I really have very dry lips 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.380
 and two more lip glosses this is from mac 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.210
 and i know the color if yes it is there 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.740
 behind the beautiful fashion scoops 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.680
 is sometimes a little color this 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.720
 more nude color 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.449
 is nothing of none of this hot 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.039
 according to my sugar and I have too 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:12.009
 bring a lipstick this is also from mac 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:14.380
 and this is the color let's see 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:16.419
 feeling mrs then of course I have too 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.280
 another eyeshadow palette with 4 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:20.110
 different colors this is from brands 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.900
 which itself, of course, quite compact to use 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.880
 and this is the palette 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:27.160
 show stopper 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.509
 and i also have eyebrow powder with it 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.919
 is actually mac's eye shadow but me 

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:31.060
 really do not know what color this is but 

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:32.740
 good close belly so always for me 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:35.349
 eyebrows and I also have a paint 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:37.360
 join in and this is the painterly color 

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:39.340
 pretty basic I let two 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.639
 boskalis maiden's de guiche 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:44.259
 great mascara and the bomb is best of me too 

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:46.990
 I think coach is pretty good about both 

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:48.880
 fine and the link with arnhem eyeliner 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.680
 that of course should not be missing and then 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.150
 I also have some brushes with it 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.860
 so this is basically what i got there 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.330
 took, and I actually thought 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.680
 that didn't have that much makeup 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.690
 but if all I do now 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:01.979
 so users who then negative of it 

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:01.979
 is actually quite a lot 

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:13.130
 you 

00:07:20.969 --> 00:07:23.059
 how 

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.600
 to 

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:29.630
 to it 

00:07:39.969 --> 00:07:41.600
 how 

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:44.080
 should 

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.080
 and
