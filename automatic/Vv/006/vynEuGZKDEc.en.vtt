process so working on your VMO a little

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.950 
process so working on your VMO a little
extra<00:00:34.739> rather<00:00:35.399> than<00:00:35.520> just<00:00:35.730> doing<00:00:36.719> their

extra rather than just doing their
quadriceps<00:00:37.559> alone<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:38.309> going<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.550> be

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
quadriceps alone is going to be

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.010 
quadriceps alone is going to be
important<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.090> try<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.390> prevent<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.899> knee

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
injuries so two exercises that are

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.860 
injuries so two exercises that are
wonderful<00:00:44.550> for<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:45.090> VMO<00:00:45.510> they're<00:00:45.719> real

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
wonderful for the VMO they're real

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.290 
wonderful for the VMO they're real
simple<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.379> do<00:00:46.559> at<00:00:46.739> home<00:00:46.980> as<00:00:47.700> well<00:00:47.879> as<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.090> gym

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
simple to do at home as well as a gym

simple to do at home as well as a gym
setting<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:49.020> going<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.440> be<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.590> straight<00:00:49.920> leg

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
setting is going to be a straight leg

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.500 
setting is going to be a straight leg
raise<00:00:50.399> where<00:00:50.670> you're<00:00:50.789> concentrating<00:00:51.149> a

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
little bit more on your VMO so the best

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.459 
little bit more on your VMO so the best
thing<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.270> do<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.840> first<00:00:55.020> straighten<00:00:55.410> out

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
thing to do is to first straighten out

thing to do is to first straighten out
your<00:00:55.500> leg<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.520> trick<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.030> try<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.420> turn

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
your leg and the trick is to try to turn

your leg and the trick is to try to turn
your<00:00:57.870> foot<00:00:58.109> out<00:00:58.320> laterally<00:00:59.070> I'll<00:00:59.460> often<00:00:59.640> tell

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
your foot out laterally I'll often tell

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.610 
your foot out laterally I'll often tell
my<00:01:00.059> patients<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.539> point<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.930> toes<00:01:01.140> at<00:01:01.350> about

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
my patients to point the toes at about

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.830 
my patients to point the toes at about
11<00:01:02.100> o'clock<00:01:02.190> or<00:01:02.640> 10<00:01:02.820> o'clock<00:01:03.090> if<00:01:03.629> you're

pretending is a clock in front of you
and<00:01:05.909> from<00:01:06.420> there<00:01:06.630> you're<00:01:06.840> trying<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.229> tighten

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
and from there you're trying to tighten

and from there you're trying to tighten
up<00:01:07.650> your<00:01:07.799> thigh<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.400> then<00:01:08.850> basically<00:01:09.390> lift<00:01:09.630> up

up your thigh and then basically lift up
your<00:01:09.930> leg<00:01:10.110> but<00:01:10.409> by<00:01:10.560> having<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.010> hip<00:01:11.220> angled

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
your leg but by having that hip angled

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.039 
your leg but by having that hip angled
you're<00:01:12.299> going<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.479> be<00:01:12.600> working<00:01:12.780> your<00:01:13.020> inner

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
you're going to be working your inner

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.320 
you're going to be working your inner
quad<00:01:13.830> portion<00:01:14.280> or<00:01:14.400> your<00:01:14.520> VMO<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.909> little<00:01:15.210> bit

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
quad portion or your VMO a little bit

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.749 
quad portion or your VMO a little bit
more<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.840> can<00:01:15.990> lower<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.200> back<00:01:16.470> down<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:16.950> so

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
more you can lower that back down and so

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.359 
more you can lower that back down and so
you<00:01:17.820> tighten<00:01:18.240> up<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.540> then<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.780> lift<00:01:19.020> and

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
you tighten up and then you lift and

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:29.090 
you tighten up and then you lift and
then<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.460> would<00:01:20.580> lower<00:01:20.700> back<00:01:20.909> down

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.560

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
the other exercise that's real simple to

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.120 
the other exercise that's real simple to
do<00:01:31.689> is<00:01:31.869> call<00:01:32.049> the<00:01:32.170> bridge<00:01:32.380> something<00:01:32.950> that<00:01:33.040> we

do is call the bridge something that we
do<00:01:33.250> a<00:01:33.280> lot<00:01:33.549> but<00:01:34.210> if<00:01:34.450> you<00:01:34.630> take<00:01:34.840> a<00:01:34.869> medicine<00:01:35.259> ball

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.130 
leg the bridge lifts they're actually
going<00:01:42.700> to<00:01:42.850> contract<00:01:43.240> your<00:01:43.330> inner<00:01:43.570> thigh<00:01:43.840> and

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
going to contract your inner thigh and

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.289 
going to contract your inner thigh and
your<00:01:44.289> VMO<00:01:44.649> muscles<00:01:45.070> a<00:01:45.189> little<00:01:45.460> more<00:01:45.640> then<00:01:46.180> you

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
your VMO muscles a little more then you

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.480 
your VMO muscles a little more then you
ordinarily<00:01:46.689> would<00:01:46.990> do<00:01:47.200> on<00:01:47.470> a<00:01:47.530> regular<00:01:48.280> bridge

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
ordinarily would do on a regular bridge

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.210 
ordinarily would do on a regular bridge
so<00:01:49.030> bridges<00:01:49.630> and<00:01:49.840> your<00:01:50.530> straight<00:01:50.799> leg<00:01:50.950> raises

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
so bridges and your straight leg raises

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.490 
so bridges and your straight leg raises
if<00:01:51.580> you're<00:01:51.820> doing<00:01:52.000> this<00:01:52.210> on<00:01:52.539> a<00:01:52.750> regular<00:01:52.840> basis

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
if you're doing this on a regular basis

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.669 
if you're doing this on a regular basis
I<00:01:53.619> recommend<00:01:54.070> maybe<00:01:54.250> two<00:01:54.610> sets<00:01:54.880> of<00:01:55.000> 10<00:01:55.299> on

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:55.679 
I recommend maybe two sets of 10 on

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:58.499 
I recommend maybe two sets of 10 on
alternating<00:01:56.679> days<00:01:56.909> three<00:01:57.909> sets<00:01:58.149> of<00:01:58.240> ten<00:01:58.390> as

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
alternating days three sets of ten as

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.090 
alternating days three sets of ten as
you<00:01:58.600> get<00:01:58.720> a<00:01:58.750> little<00:01:58.990> stronger<00:01:59.259> and<00:01:59.590> then<00:02:00.009> you

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
you get a little stronger and then you

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.590 
you get a little stronger and then you
can<00:02:00.250> kind<00:02:00.490> of<00:02:00.580> progress<00:02:00.850> with<00:02:01.090> the<00:02:01.179> leg<00:02:01.360> raises

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
can kind of progress with the leg raises

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.169 
can kind of progress with the leg raises
to<00:02:02.380> a<00:02:02.409> weight<00:02:02.979> or<00:02:03.190> you<00:02:03.520> can<00:02:03.700> continue<00:02:03.970> doing

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
to a weight or you can continue doing

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:05.730 
to a weight or you can continue doing
this<00:02:04.420> and<00:02:04.659> holding<00:02:04.990> your<00:02:05.110> bridge<00:02:05.319> up<00:02:05.500> a<00:02:05.590> little

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
this and holding your bridge up a little

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.060 
this and holding your bridge up a little
bit<00:02:05.890> longer<00:02:06.159> as<00:02:06.459> a<00:02:06.490> progression
