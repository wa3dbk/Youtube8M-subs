00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
another squad builder today this is

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.990 
another squad builder today this is
probably<00:00:15.540> one<00:00:15.750> of<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.960> best<00:00:16.139> hybrids<00:00:17.070> I<00:00:17.369> have

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
probably one of the best hybrids I have

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.960 
probably one of the best hybrids I have
built<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.570> date<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:19.020> didn't<00:00:19.980> play<00:00:20.340> much<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.789> it

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
built to date I didn't play much of it

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.090 
built to date I didn't play much of it
so<00:00:21.359> I<00:00:21.390> didn't<00:00:21.869> I<00:00:22.050> haven't<00:00:22.380> got<00:00:22.470> any<00:00:22.619> goals<00:00:22.830> for

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
so I didn't I haven't got any goals for

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.990 
so I didn't I haven't got any goals for
the<00:00:23.310> end<00:00:23.600> but<00:00:24.600> is<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:25.740> really<00:00:26.310> amazing<00:00:26.550> team

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
the end but is a really amazing team

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.140 
the end but is a really amazing team
costs<00:00:27.420> about<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:28.160> 1.2<00:00:29.160> million<00:00:29.550> coins<00:00:29.880> I

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
costs about and 1.2 million coins I

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.510 
costs about and 1.2 million coins I
think<00:00:30.779> it<00:00:30.869> make<00:00:30.990> us<00:00:31.170> less<00:00:31.410> now<00:00:31.650> due<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.250> price

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
think it make us less now due to a price

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.880 
think it make us less now due to a price
drop<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:32.940> some<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.300> players<00:00:33.559> but<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.770> know

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
drop of some of the players but I know

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.209 
drop of some of the players but I know
one<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.579> them<00:00:35.850> has<00:00:36.149> increased<00:00:36.719> by<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:36.989> bit<00:00:37.290> let's

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
one of them has increased by a bit let's

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.450 
one of them has increased by a bit let's
get<00:00:38.370> straight<00:00:38.579> into<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.969> goalkeeper<00:00:40.190> so<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.219> got

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
get straight into a goalkeeper so I got

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.440 
get straight into a goalkeeper so I got
