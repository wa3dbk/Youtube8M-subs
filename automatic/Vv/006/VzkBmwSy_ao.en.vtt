00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.059

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:22.680

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:25.770

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.030
 helped this year nothing will go off 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:37.870
 someone is a beautiful tree therefore 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:40.430
 extra yogurt is very tasty but a little 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:47.140
 wildly 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:47.140
 and where you are not because compote January 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:02:06.130
 then to use any pastries 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.130
 Buryat cup method and you can now 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:15.560
 what is the future will be remembered turkish 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.920
 pyramid 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:22.130
 I have already prepared the principle remains 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:25.250
 so it is built means it is given 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:30.250
 I take any exact water pipe 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:34.160
 then put the middle to the ground 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:39.709
 before that you fall asleep with the earth and 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:42.380
 and on the other hand maybe it's normal as a dependent 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:46.070
 of potatoes should be planted 18 contused 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:49.910
 and a half and a half and a half height 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:55.420
 meters mean now we take that here in 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:58.370
 this friend fall asleep sawdust 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.690
 keep no learned speak at work in 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.180
 life is useful 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.170
 so far nothing hard hammering sawdust 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.660
 circling the pipe 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:10.410
 now it means you 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:10.410
 take the pipe and take out 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.379
 Well than why 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:43.500
 we still have this now 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:48.629
 hole we will water 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:52.400
 Sawdust potato will keep for a long time 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:04:02.209
 moisture and the whole pyramid will eat 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:04:08.599
 then we take and make a hole take 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:08.599
 potato and in this hole thrust 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:29.100
 20 centimeters distance between nicks 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:31.220
 that's about it means below will go 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.220
 more 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:40.700
 thick mustache should be fine to be 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.700
 means potato 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:49.500
 in fact, too, it turns out last year 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:53.599
 we had almost a bag of potatoes now 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:57.120
 so we planted here in this here squirrels 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:05:00.120
 need to water the savanna from the inside soaked 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:04.730
 sawdust fed on water for a very long time 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:08.600
 squirrels are wet give away pocket moisture 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:11.460
 there will be such a hat as baby 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.620
 nice and comfortable and profitable 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.020
 I think that if you like the way 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:19.490
 flush it may be worth a try and 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.490
 make such a will at your decree
