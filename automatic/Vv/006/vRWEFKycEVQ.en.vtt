00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
with you you know I kind of used as a

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.659 
with you you know I kind of used as a
recruiting<00:04:55.380> tool<00:04:55.470> that<00:04:55.800> was<00:04:55.889> my<00:04:56.040> whole<00:04:56.220> point

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
recruiting tool that was my whole point

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:00.200

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
and so they played the game I was really

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.159 
and so they played the game I was really
worried<00:05:00.510> that<00:05:00.540> we<00:05:00.720> were<00:05:00.780> just<00:05:00.870> gonna<00:05:01.020> get

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
smashed because the Select game is a

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.260 
smashed because the Select game is a
different<00:05:04.320> speed<00:05:04.530> level<00:05:04.919> than<00:05:05.669> what<00:05:05.880> we<00:05:06.030> play

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270
