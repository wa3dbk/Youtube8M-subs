 nowhere a victim the imaginary 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.440
 divided into three sectors the center

 city ​​the industrial district and the 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.690
 residential area where you can see 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:47.480
 small screenshots of neighborhoods 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.650
 in front of you in each neighborhood and the 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.480
 three banks offer missions 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.450
 different to these gangs are the yakuza 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.280
 the nice wolves 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.130
 and the high bass all for the 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.020
 downtown the red neck the srs and the 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.479
 high bass all and the asahi bass all 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.850

 bass all for the industrial district 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.200
 a lot that's where they found 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.910
 names but it got complicated they 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.140
 pleaded vast where is present in all 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.810
 neighborhoods because it's the gang the 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.400
 the more powerful each district 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.230
 owning each neighborhood if you 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.670
 prefer to have a maximum level of 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.340
 search by the police that the player 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:27.780
 can therefore reach the gign and the 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.099
 paluche and the fbi and the army and is 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.790
 not available at the beginning of the game is 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.829
 available 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.660
 after we are better known in 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:34.019
 police services to escape the 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.150
 police 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:39.569
 the player can go paint his car 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.459
 in a garages garage is called max 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.510
 pay a reference to max payne already 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.610
 two years before its release 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.690
 so the explain problem came out in 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.790
 2000 is now 2.2 grams of tea 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:55.769
 to go I was to big theft auto 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.850
 before gta iv and gta iv in paris ago 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.190
 three levels difficulties for 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.410
 the easy gold issue given by the 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.480
 phone do mean by the phone 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.220
 yellow that bring in more money but 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.500
 requires more respect on the part of the 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.359
 gang is difficult to talk to for 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.280
 red phones that pays a lot 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:12.590
 but that are really very difficult and 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.110
 which require 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.230
 maximum respect level I'm going 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.060
 explain what is respect 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.290
 just after each mission complete 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.790
 the player earns money can 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.930
 sometimes that managing missions the 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.599
 player has access to new vehicles 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.890
 weapons or place there are six missions for 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:31.310
 to be for the three gangs a level 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.530
 so 18 points level and about 75 in 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.390
 all the game with the missions 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.310
 secondary so a little buret of life 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.890
 but something is enough 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.489
 for for the time sales of corey 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.560
 collector 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.750
 so for the changes compared to 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.459
 gta and not much 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.590
 you must always go through the phone 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.170
 for issuing weapons are the same 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.400
 apart from a few novelties crushed the 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.890
 fish and destroy the vehicles 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.540
 always brings back money there is 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.049
 always present bugs with respect to 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:02.150
 the same bugs compared to gt1 and the 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:04.129
 driving is really for me a lot 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.360
 more difficult than gta than this terrain 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:07.879
 she is much more sensitive who is 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.910
 finds under the guidance in the spirits 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:11.900
 more see there is a little a little horrible 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.329
 so what's different is the 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.790
 ball to the gilles of course it's a 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:19.600
 city side 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.320
 no japanese chinese theme a system 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.850
 day and night 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.610
 so what do I call the system 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.620
 day and night it's actually because there is the 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.720
 system of hours for example if it is 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.039
 noon it will be daylight and if it is midnight it 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.570
 night will make sense but whose 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:34.930
 I really was this system was not 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.340
 were not present or the system of 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.919
 respect so is the system of 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.960
 respect it is with the territories that 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:42.910
 belong to each gang plus the rating 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.530
 go up towards one to a bang so 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.710
 the more you do missions for mang 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.599
 and the more interesting resignation and me 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.699
 we are attacked where he can this is 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:52.780
 the opposite effect so that if we do more 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:54.690
 missions for a gang that will be 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.190
 tested is hated by the enemy gang 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.070
 whose missions we do for example if 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.500
 we do missions for the gang of 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:06.430
 yakuza for example if it's their 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:08.440
 enemy cdh bastou and bahrain do you 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.750
 respect less and less powerful with 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.190
 low hedges nothing big 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.560
 novelties also in this great theft 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.740
 self is the multiplayer where we can 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.970
 play up to 6 in the same city and he 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.770
 is possible to play in by quillan 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:24.430
 but overall he had been sloppy 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:27.370
 but it's losing two games from where the 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.570
 multi absent in big theft auto gta 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.550
 San Andreas 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.690
 because they had been all 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.500
 players had said they were 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.320
 really bad 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.699
 so the video is already finished because 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.320
 that there is not much to say about 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:41.050
 the on this shaiya can make us from 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.320
 great novelty compared to shake to 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.039
 1 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:47.530
 but in the next week for the 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:49.270

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.979
 novelties like that will be gta iii ago 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.820
 already there vuc the different ones and there are 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:53.560
 a lot of news 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:55.330
 so I hope you enjoyed the video 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.030
 because I have followed your 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.380
