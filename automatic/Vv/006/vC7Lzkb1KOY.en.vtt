00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.600
 Red Stone and Worktable 

00:00:03.239 --> 00:00:10.080
 What is a reverse workbench 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.830
 It is what returns to the material what was once crafted 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:18.090
 I do with also, if that is not the case Cheat ones 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:21.080
 No I can make a diamond from snow because it contains ic 2 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:25.220
 It is a translation was good, such say it Te Cheat 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:31.490
 Please, take a look at the snow matter people want to know more details, 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:33.920
 This is a story you should never do only for you, unless you say that Marisa is a cheat 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:41.070
 Hey, I'd had to 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:47.340
 Why I'm making a chest for convenience I'm too about the explanation 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:52.770
 I have been trained by an engineer for a while in Ishimura for a while recently 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:55.260
 I 'm making a backpack now as an engineer too ! 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.540
 This is a Kofu backpack 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:05.260
 This is Kofu's backpack 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:06.910
 Because I say have there now here is Kofu backpack here in the Kofu 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:13.210
 It is a backpack 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:14.830
 No in do it is that this is me chest that can be carried but really? Ne just Chinese characters is different 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.530
 Kana Well 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:23.810
 There are things that are not put to those put depending on the type of backpack 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:26.840
 It seems that these two are basically going to mine 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.150
 But branch mining is all cut 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:33.420
 Hey 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:38.490
 That's why Qary is running. 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:41.100
 What's more, it looks like it 's a video after digging a bit 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.610
 Description of the mouse was broken 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.610
 It will Ne relationship 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:55.530
 You can make an alloy furnace with brick bee 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:57.000
 It is a furnace for making an alloy literally What is it used for? 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.620
 But whether to make 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.370
 Bases are narrow, and it is good to add each time 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:11.340
 Good conduct among you what or cool 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:18.000
 There is a place to put a lot in this alloy stove to explain why it is not good 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:21.610
 Hey there, it is decided to be fuel in there and put in more than a certain number and it will be made alloy 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.620
 How long will it give you a short, long issue ? 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.700
 Well 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:32.129
 ok nice person let's do it actually 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:38.099
 At first we put copper tin necessary for the alloy to make this fuel 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:42.470
 Now that I started thinking about it a little while ago, what is it? 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:45.470
 Did not moving at a little while ago one Kua Lee solar panel 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:49.569
 I oil vinegar alloy was completed 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:54.370
 I will explain a little later 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:59.049
 A little nether will come obsidian Where are you from? 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:03.219
 9Early digged for you, but it was like that 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:07.900
 I'll make excuses and delays in posting 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:09.590
 First of all I do not even try to How about this that 1 mouse was broken 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.700
 Recording with no mouse 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:19.220
 However, I was recording for a while because I would be slump today 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:20.300
 In the meantime, I did branch mining and I was moving and recorded without a mouse 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:25.670
 I am 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:28.299
 In fact, there ah ah Daa'm moving Nde early in the one that Kuari solar one 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.299
 It's not 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:35.860
 Is 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:36.520
 But even if you're hiding, it's not about the speed you can get out with only 5 pieces 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:43.600
 Why 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:49.830
 So there's only one attached, so it's too late 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.830
 There you know of ordinary solar 64 pieces of output in one minute 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:59.000
 No, you said last time you pulled Ultimate Solar 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:05.240
 I said it was increased by that amount 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:10.650
 Was added in the mean that Oh is a compact solar the way, reason gave me this Part 2 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:12.840
 So what kind of mod this mod compresses the solar panel 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:19.650
 It is a mod to 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:21.359
 1 In short, the solar panel of the 8 minutes I'm sorry I do not know what are you doing saying to eight times the output 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.860
 It is something to make 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:29.550
 I see 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:32.669
 Well then that's 64 times more solar than the one that was reduced to one eighth. 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:37.379
 That 's right I have a lot of stuff 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:42.849
 Iron What Oh solar 1 make staff is 7 I'm there about stack 

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:48.699
 Strictly speaking, more will come in, but I guess it's compression 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:52.849
 It's the last time I collect and compress 8 more r 1/64 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:56.389
 Because it is 864 times 8 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:59.869
 Has 512 answers 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:04.279
 Oh and the voltage also goes up one step 

00:04:59.869 --> 00:05:12.669
 That is 64 times the solar I'm using now is medium pressure 

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:12.669
 I understand well-it is the correct answer I will cut a little getting used someday soon- 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:23.480
 I came back crying because it was attacked by fast 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:25.380
 What do you Ndakaato something behavior funny it in the touch panel like a Toko without using a mouse 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.990
 I'm doing 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.350
 In early early Ouchi 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.350
 that 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:43.200
 There was nothing 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:48.930
 Story is from Deko' gonna be Seyana 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:49.890
 I made a tube using the brass I made earlier. 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.169
 Let's go 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:54.469
 Chubu 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:58.999
 It's like a red power pipe 

00:05:54.469 --> 00:06:04.599
 More of here is a little clever Neato I will be heavy 

00:05:58.999 --> 00:06:04.599
 Hey'm distress Do not use too few if heavy 

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:11.570
 Yoshi can have this item's what 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:17.440
 It is for transmitting the signal of Akaishi to the tube 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:21.490
 Considerably No Do mice were cut or I Kraft was very 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:25.750
 In is completed haircut cut This is it what 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:31.270
 This is a recycler and it produces scrap 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:33.250
 Mechanism is at every predetermined time block breaker through the tube by the timer circuit 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:37.820
 Akaishi signal input 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:43.940
 The itemized cobbles enter the recycler through the tube 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:47.389
 I could understand that I can cobble stone again with lava and water 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:50.479
 Well favorite person will is examined by their own 

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:57.100
 That's right, so this time until here 

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:57.100
 Baibai because we finished the test until the next is probably early ze So next time
