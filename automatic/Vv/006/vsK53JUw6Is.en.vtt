00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
you've already seen I believe these are

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.640 
you've already seen I believe these are
the<00:04:11.850> new<00:04:12.060> ones<00:04:12.269> yeah<00:04:12.750> they're<00:04:13.019> ibly<00:04:13.200> out<00:04:13.320> July

the new ones yeah they're ibly out July

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.500 
the new ones yeah they're ibly out July
2015<00:04:14.100> it<00:04:14.430> says<00:04:14.579> on<00:04:14.700> the<00:04:14.760> card<00:04:14.940> right<00:04:15.150> there<00:04:15.180> so

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
2015 it says on the card right there so

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.960 
2015 it says on the card right there so
these<00:04:15.630> are<00:04:15.780> the<00:04:15.870> new<00:04:15.989> figures<00:04:16.970> presumably

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
these are the new figures presumably

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.969 
these are the new figures presumably
from<00:04:18.329> the<00:04:18.540> later<00:04:18.690> seasons<00:04:19.019> of<00:04:19.350> the<00:04:19.410> show<00:04:19.620> like

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
from the later seasons of the show like

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:23.810 
from the later seasons of the show like
season<00:04:20.459> 6<00:04:20.850> and<00:04:21.120> 7<00:04:21.959> I<00:04:22.049> think<00:04:22.099> because<00:04:23.099> Gemma

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
season 6 and 7 I think because Gemma

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.969 
season 6 and 7 I think because Gemma
comes<00:04:24.180> with<00:04:24.330> a<00:04:24.390> skateboard<00:04:24.750> and<00:04:25.289> you<00:04:25.800> know<00:04:25.919> she

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
comes with a skateboard and you know she

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:27.240 
comes with a skateboard and you know she
pops<00:04:26.400> that<00:04:26.610> woman<00:04:26.910> in<00:04:27.000> the<00:04:27.060> face

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
pops that woman in the face

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.680 
pops that woman in the face
with<00:04:27.430> the<00:04:27.520> skateboard<00:04:27.970> and<00:04:28.060> I<00:04:28.090> think<00:04:28.450> that

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
with the skateboard and I think that

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.860 
with the skateboard and I think that
happened<00:04:29.260> in<00:04:29.440> either<00:04:29.880> season<00:04:30.880> five<00:04:31.180> or<00:04:31.360> six<00:04:31.720> I

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
happened in either season five or six I

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.780 
happened in either season five or six I
think<00:04:31.900> it<00:04:32.140> was<00:04:32.230> later<00:04:32.470> in<00:04:32.590> the<00:04:32.740> show<00:04:33.460> when<00:04:33.640> that

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
think it was later in the show when that

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.390 
think it was later in the show when that
happened<00:04:34.240> I<00:04:34.420> could<00:04:34.930> be<00:04:35.050> wrong<00:04:35.290> though

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
happened I could be wrong though

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.870 
happened I could be wrong though
and<00:04:36.610> there's<00:04:36.970> Opie<00:04:37.950> probably<00:04:38.950> probably<00:04:39.700> from

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
and there's Opie probably probably from

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.800 
and there's Opie probably probably from
season<00:04:40.300> five<00:04:40.540> maybe<00:04:41.290> season<00:04:41.770> four<00:04:42.040> so<00:04:43.030> these

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
season five maybe season four so these

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.230 
season five maybe season four so these
are<00:04:44.080> the<00:04:44.140> new<00:04:44.320> line<00:04:44.640> now<00:04:45.640> I<00:04:45.670> think<00:04:45.880> we're

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
are the new line now I think we're

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.640 
are the new line now I think we're
getting<00:04:46.450> into<00:04:46.510> some<00:04:46.660> of<00:04:46.960> the<00:04:47.020> old<00:04:47.200> figures

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
getting into some of the old figures

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.070 
getting into some of the old figures
