00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
is to be able to filter new aquarium

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.410 
is to be able to filter new aquarium
that's<00:00:33.480> only<00:00:33.930> about<00:00:34.200> this<00:00:34.500> small<00:00:35.059> the<00:00:36.059> filter

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
that's only about this small the filter

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.020 
that's only about this small the filter
really<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.840> useful<00:00:37.320> for<00:00:37.579> filtering<00:00:38.579> aquariums

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
really is useful for filtering aquariums

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
really is useful for filtering aquariums
that<00:00:39.120> have<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.239> small<00:00:39.540> amount<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:41.239> water<00:00:42.239> but

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
that have a small amount of water but

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.069 
that have a small amount of water but
still<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.860> need<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.070> be<00:00:44.160> really<00:00:44.399> clean

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
still you need to be really clean

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.290 
still you need to be really clean
because<00:00:46.079> small<00:00:46.770> filters<00:00:47.129> also<00:00:47.399> only<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.969> very

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
because small filters also only a very

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.750 
because small filters also only a very
little<00:00:48.480> filter<00:00:48.750> material<00:00:49.170> this<00:00:49.320> filter<00:00:49.760> pass

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
little filter material this filter pass

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.330 
little filter material this filter pass
as<00:00:51.180> much<00:00:51.360> filter<00:00:51.690> material<00:00:52.140> s<00:00:52.260> half<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:53.100> water

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
as much filter material s half the water

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.250 
as much filter material s half the water
it's<00:00:53.520> going<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.760> filter<00:00:53.940> so<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:54.840> way<00:00:55.110> the

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
it's going to filter so that way the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.479 
it's going to filter so that way the
water<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.559> going<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.829> stay<00:00:56.010> cleaner<00:00:57.079> now<00:00:58.489> to

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
water is going to stay cleaner now to

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.869 
water is going to stay cleaner now to
build<00:00:59.699> this<00:01:00.469> filter<00:01:01.469> you're<00:01:02.430> gonna<00:01:02.520> take<00:01:02.730> your

you<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.630> lot<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.260> this<00:01:10.439> likes<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.770> sponge<00:01:11.090> to<00:01:12.090> make

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
you a lot of this likes a sponge to make

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.359 
you a lot of this likes a sponge to make
sure<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:12.750> they're<00:01:12.960> none<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.159> small

stones fall out because you drill a hole

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.940 
stones fall out because you drill a hole
at<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.360> bottom<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:18.900> water<00:01:19.110> off<00:01:19.439> this<00:01:19.650> um

are supposed to have um Maki bacteria

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.160 
are supposed to have um Maki bacteria
buildup<00:01:43.649> inside<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.520> them<00:01:44.700> but<00:01:45.450> since<00:01:46.020> I'm

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
buildup inside of them but since I'm

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.490 
buildup inside of them but since I'm
already<00:01:46.350> using<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.310> main<00:01:47.579> filter<00:01:48.170> for<00:01:49.170> my<00:01:49.290> fish

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
already using a main filter for my fish

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.609 
already using a main filter for my fish
tank<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:50.520> water<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:50.909> pretty<00:01:51.149> clean<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:51.619> the

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
tank the water is pretty clean so the

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.800 
tank the water is pretty clean so the
only<00:01:52.950> area<00:01:53.549> where<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:54.000> bacteria<00:01:54.180> builds<00:01:54.689> up

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
only area where the bacteria builds up

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.480 
only area where the bacteria builds up
is<00:01:55.590> on<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.920> spun<00:01:56.159> as<00:01:56.460> on<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.930> foam<00:01:57.930> here<00:01:58.490> so

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
is on the spun as on the foam here so

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.139 
is on the spun as on the foam here so
you'll<00:02:00.270> need<00:02:01.009> aquarium<00:02:02.009> gravel<00:02:02.250> which<00:02:02.939> is

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
you'll need aquarium gravel which is

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.730 
you'll need aquarium gravel which is
really<00:02:03.360> cheap<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.840> can<00:02:03.960> buy<00:02:03.990> like<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.259> kilogram

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
really cheap you can buy like a kilogram

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.069 
really cheap you can buy like a kilogram
for<00:02:04.950> two<00:02:05.070> dollars<00:02:05.329> plus<00:02:06.329> some<00:02:06.540> kind<00:02:06.719> of<00:02:06.780> straws

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.059 
and that's what goes on the bottom of
the<00:02:08.459> filter<00:02:08.720> so<00:02:09.720> just<00:02:10.289> let<00:02:10.560> me<00:02:10.590> do<00:02:10.800> that<00:02:10.890> really

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
the filter so just let me do that really

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:38.070 
the filter so just let me do that really
quick

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
top you don't geez aquarium will you can

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.520 
top you don't geez aquarium will you can
also<00:03:06.739> use<00:03:06.920> um<00:03:08.620> other<00:03:09.620> materials<00:03:10.310> that<00:03:11.410> let<00:03:12.410> the

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
also use um other materials that let the

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.949 
also use um other materials that let the
water<00:03:12.709> run<00:03:12.800> through<00:03:12.980> and<00:03:13.610> have<00:03:14.090> space<00:03:14.750> for

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
water run through and have space for

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.440 
water run through and have space for
them<00:03:15.080> to<00:03:15.200> build<00:03:15.590> bacteria<00:03:16.489> on<00:03:16.670> but<00:03:16.910> I<00:03:17.090> find<00:03:17.329> a

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
them to build bacteria on but I find a

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.810 
them to build bacteria on but I find a
comparable<00:03:17.690> to<00:03:18.200> be<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.410> best<00:03:18.560> if<00:03:19.340> you<00:03:19.549> put<00:03:19.700> the

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
comparable to be the best if you put the

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:28.840 
comparable to be the best if you put the
crown<00:03:20.180> wheel<00:03:20.360> on<00:03:21.250> you<00:03:22.250> just<00:03:22.459> simply<00:03:26.200> end<00:03:27.850> of

crown wheel on you just simply end of
the<00:03:29.000> water<00:03:29.209> bottle<00:03:30.040> back<00:03:31.040> on<00:03:31.280> like<00:03:31.579> so<00:03:31.820> and

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
the water bottle back on like so and

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.360 
the water bottle back on like so and
here's<00:03:34.040> the<00:03:34.220> filtering<00:03:34.579> part<00:03:34.940> of<00:03:35.120> your<00:03:36.370> queer

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
need to attach the water pump to it well

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:46.990 
need to attach the water pump to it well
really<00:03:44.480> all<00:03:44.989> it<00:03:45.140> needs<00:03:45.320> to<00:03:45.380> do<00:03:45.590> is<00:03:45.860> pump<00:03:46.670> water

water<00:03:58.090> in<00:03:59.090> out<00:04:00.079> of<00:04:00.230> the<00:04:00.350> aquarium<00:04:00.560> and<00:04:01.600> stick

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
water in out of the aquarium and stick

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.870 
water in out of the aquarium and stick
it<00:04:02.630> in<00:04:02.840> a<00:04:02.930> hole<00:04:03.110> that<00:04:03.860> you<00:04:03.920> drill<00:04:04.250> from<00:04:04.400> the<00:04:04.640> top

it in a hole that you drill from the top

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.370 
it in a hole that you drill from the top
of<00:04:05.799> the<00:04:06.850> filter<00:04:07.850> and<00:04:08.209> really<00:04:08.840> what<00:04:08.989> I<00:04:09.019> found<00:04:09.200> to

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
of the filter and really what I found to

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.990 
of the filter and really what I found to
work<00:04:09.410> really<00:04:09.709> well<00:04:09.829> as<00:04:09.980> a<00:04:10.220> sole<00:04:10.609> during<00:04:10.820> iron

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
work really well as a sole during iron

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.810 
work really well as a sole during iron
to<00:04:11.209> make<00:04:11.239> you<00:04:11.480> sold<00:04:11.750> that<00:04:12.519> just<00:04:13.519> melts<00:04:13.670> the
