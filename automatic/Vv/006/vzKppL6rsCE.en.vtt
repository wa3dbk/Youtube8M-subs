00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470

we can put a G mater hum a heads-up

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
we can put a G mater hum a heads-up
display<00:02:34.770> yes<00:02:35.800> gives<00:02:36.190> us<00:02:36.310> a<00:02:36.400> very<00:02:36.580> basic

heads-up display Julie I think it's more

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.430 
heads-up display Julie I think it's more
sophisticated<00:02:40.510> than<00:02:40.870> the<00:02:41.020> one<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:41.350> they've

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
sophisticated than the one and they've

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.380 
sophisticated than the one and they've
BMW<00:02:41.980> extremely<00:02:42.459> dry<00:02:44.880> yeah<00:02:45.880> but<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.180> one<00:02:46.300> in

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
BMW extremely dry yeah but the one in

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.570 
BMW extremely dry yeah but the one in
the<00:02:46.450> VW<00:02:46.750> would<00:02:47.080> show<00:02:47.260> 10<00:02:47.440> by<00:02:47.590> 10<00:02:47.739> this<00:02:48.250> doesn't

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
the VW would show 10 by 10 this doesn't

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.160 
the VW would show 10 by 10 this doesn't
do<00:02:48.640> that<00:02:48.790> but<00:02:48.850> this<00:02:49.090> will<00:02:49.239> show<00:02:49.300> G<00:02:49.660> meter<00:02:49.840> so

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
do that but this will show G meter so

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.930 
do that but this will show G meter so
it's<00:02:50.290> like<00:02:50.470> exactly<00:02:51.070> for<00:02:51.340> their<00:02:51.459> being<00:02:51.610> see<00:02:51.880> if

the<00:03:12.300> paddock<00:03:12.600> right<00:03:12.840> yeah<00:03:13.650> that's<00:03:13.890> the

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
the paddock right yeah that's the

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.370 
the paddock right yeah that's the
impression<00:03:14.220> again<00:03:14.520> which<00:03:15.240> to<00:03:15.750> most<00:03:15.930> people

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
impression again which to most people

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.370 
impression again which to most people
would<00:03:16.560> be<00:03:16.680> scary<00:03:17.150> this<00:03:18.150> is<00:03:18.209> not<00:03:18.570> scary<00:03:19.020> yeah

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
would be scary this is not scary yeah

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.220 
would be scary this is not scary yeah
and<00:03:19.650> I<00:03:20.040> think<00:03:20.100> that<00:03:20.370> that's<00:03:20.520> a<00:03:20.730> detriment<00:03:21.240> yeah

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
and I think that that's a detriment yeah

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.770 
and I think that that's a detriment yeah
needs<00:03:22.590> I<00:03:23.070> think<00:03:23.520> it<00:03:23.610> should<00:03:23.730> be<00:03:23.850> more<00:03:24.030> scary<00:03:24.420> it

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
needs I think it should be more scary it

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.440 
needs I think it should be more scary it
needs<00:03:24.990> to<00:03:25.140> be<00:03:25.260> less<00:03:25.470> sophisticated<00:03:25.830> oh<00:03:26.490> that's

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
needs to be less sophisticated oh that's

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.270 
needs to be less sophisticated oh that's
the<00:03:27.600> thing<00:03:27.680> you<00:03:28.680> know<00:03:28.709> when<00:03:28.890> you<00:03:28.950> get<00:03:29.040> little

eighteen hundred kilos remember big here
we<00:03:49.140> can<00:03:49.380> not<00:03:50.070> fair<00:03:50.340> that's<00:03:50.489> husky<00:03:51.830> its<00:03:52.830> fact

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
we can not fair that's husky its fact

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.500 
we can not fair that's husky its fact
it<00:03:53.400> weighs<00:03:53.640> 1,800<00:03:54.209> kilos<00:03:54.750> very<00:03:55.380> but<00:03:56.360> if<00:03:57.360> that

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
it weighs 1,800 kilos very but if that

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.150 
it weighs 1,800 kilos very but if that
eighteen<00:03:57.870> hundred<00:03:58.140> kilos<00:03:58.470> should<00:03:58.800> not<00:03:58.980> bear

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
eighteen hundred kilos should not bear

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.530

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
to move as fast as advance

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.110 
to move as fast as advance
I<00:04:00.780> think<00:04:01.410> they<00:04:01.650> advise<00:04:02.370> our<00:04:02.550> Holden<00:04:02.850> if<00:04:02.970> that's

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
I think they advise our Holden if that's

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.360 
I think they advise our Holden if that's
not<00:04:03.330> pretty<00:04:03.510> pretty<00:04:04.380> clever<00:04:04.680> stuff<00:04:05.040> with<00:04:05.250> the

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
not pretty pretty clever stuff with the

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.729 
not pretty pretty clever stuff with the
damping<00:04:05.760> in<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:06.660> suspension<00:04:07.019> which<00:04:07.350> is<00:04:07.500> part

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
damping in the suspension which is part

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:15.040 
damping in the suspension which is part
of<00:04:07.830> why<00:04:07.950> it<00:04:08.010> ride<00:04:08.340> so<00:04:08.610> well<00:04:08.760> over<00:04:08.910> bumps
