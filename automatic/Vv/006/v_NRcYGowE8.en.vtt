00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.120 
references for anyone that may need it
but<00:00:24.630> I<00:00:24.689> think<00:00:24.840> it's<00:00:25.289> getting<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.039> point

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
but I think it's getting to the point

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.689 
but I think it's getting to the point
where<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:27.390> cat's<00:00:27.570> mouth<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:28.019> much<00:00:28.170> bigger<00:00:28.380> and

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:28.699 
where the cat's mouth is much bigger and

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:30.919 
where the cat's mouth is much bigger and
most<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:29.789> my<00:00:29.880> traders<00:00:30.210> don't<00:00:30.420> know<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:30.779> there

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
most of my traders don't know that there

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.510 
most of my traders don't know that there
is<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.140> separate<00:00:31.529> trade<00:00:31.740> channel<00:00:32.070> for<00:00:32.340> those

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
is a separate trade channel for those

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.760 
is a separate trade channel for those
videos<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:33.180> at<00:00:33.899> this<00:00:34.050> point<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:34.440> think<00:00:34.469> it's

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
videos and at this point I think it's

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.380 
videos and at this point I think it's
alright<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.070> keep<00:00:35.610> things<00:00:35.850> all<00:00:36.059> on<00:00:36.210> one

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
alright to keep things all on one
