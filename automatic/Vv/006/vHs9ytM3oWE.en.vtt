to go and set it back up again stopped
working

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
working

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.729 
working
like<00:00:47.820> when<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.390> pressed<00:00:48.600> on<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.840> pedal<00:00:49.320> the

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
like when I pressed on the pedal the

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.229 
like when I pressed on the pedal the
vibrations<00:00:50.340> wouldn't<00:00:50.670> come<00:00:50.789> back<00:00:50.940> anymore

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
vibrations wouldn't come back anymore

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.279 
vibrations wouldn't come back anymore
and<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.670> actual<00:00:53.670> power<00:00:53.910> box<00:00:54.270> is<00:00:54.480> still<00:00:54.600> on<00:00:54.899> but

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
and the actual power box is still on but

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.560 
and the actual power box is still on but
I<00:00:55.610> think<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.730> might<00:00:56.850> win<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.090> puzzle<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.480> a

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
I think it might win the puzzle that a

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.260 
I think it might win the puzzle that a
blowin<00:00:58.109> or<00:00:58.289> something<00:00:58.859> every<00:00:58.980> but<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.579> didn't
