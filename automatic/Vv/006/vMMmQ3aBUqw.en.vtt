00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.360
 During the 1990s, the growing international expansion of companies 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.770
 I happened to a group of Chilean entrepreneurs that from our 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:16.000
 The country decided to elaborate a new line of barrels that merges the 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.380
 traditional raw materials with innovative processing systems 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.620
 friendly to the environment and the preservation of natural resources 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:30.019
 a productive initiative loaded with tradition and not hurriedly linked to the world 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:31.279
 Of the wine 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:37.219
 The national cooperage exports 75% of its barrels to various countries as 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:41.920
 united states argentina in south africa and australia betting on innovation 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.920
 that in a market of centuries of tradition 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.180
 one of the important challenges was to make the decision to enter with a 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.730
 Chili proton had no great tradition 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.710
 but with an important wine market that contributes every day to the 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.560
 production of fine wines with high pri recognition standards 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.280
 international 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.430
 Among its main products is the odyssey barrel that stands out for its 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.180
 innovation that they have confiscated in their creation the only toast happened 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.500
 in the world 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.210
 a process of 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.300
 refined aging of this type of wood 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.290
 in which they apply for approximately two years with more than 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.980
 two years 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.930
 the law of waters that are approximately miner per year is established 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.960
 and even water what it achieves is 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.960
 change the physical and chemical characteristics of this wood 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.310
 this wood throughout this time is conditioned to that it is already 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.859
 list 

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:40.190
 to enter classes 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.750
 the manufacturing process begins with a grandmother who is going to be the 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.630
 future barrel helmet 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.550
 financially as ela subsequently a rosette is manufactured that is called 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.050
 this recipe is subjected to a steam chamber 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.520
 approximately for 30 to 40 minutes 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.670
 if it is reached, the physical wood is softened 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.370
 a helmet will take shape and this helmet goes to the toasting process 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.970
 the tÃºs all convection of the barrel or vice limit the intensity of the aromas 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.910
 kindness and without it a more bear harmony bag respecting the 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.180
 Parietal and romantic characteristics of the fruit 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.640
 also that the process does not affect the kinetics of fruit exchange wood 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.010
 on the contrary if you look at considerable enhancements in the aromatic style 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.430
 active busta and therefore the personality of each wine 

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:35.849
 Papacy convection occurs mainly in value generator 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:36.419
 which one 

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:41.489
 c by fan ventilation system generating airs at different temperatures 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.749
 which is conducted with a system of pipes the even homogeneous form 

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:50.449
 towards the hull of the barrel this heat is changing temperature and are 

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:53.219
 production of different chemical reactions in wood 

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:57.409
 traditional tostao is a path that is basically done with fire like 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:01.180
 energetic source this fire is that it performs the roasting process inside 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.930
 the barrel we depend on the hand of man to see if a barrel that a 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.299
 Like the other, for example, it is already very irregular and difficult to control 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.920
 instead, convection is a process that is perfectly controlled in 

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:14.639
 all in all its variables 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:18.609
 the tide can be temperature time humidity of the air fia by 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:19.419
 example 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:22.589
 and this tide is handled to perfection 

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:26.349
 handle different products and create different aromatic profiles 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:28.559
 grace these variables 

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:31.439
 for the manufacture of the grill 11 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:35.629
 national cooperage has developed software that monitors the appropriate 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:40.010
 occurred in controlling the progressive increase of temperature and its 

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:44.879
 intensity to such an extent that they manage to predict the organoleptic results 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:48.309
 of any recipe with maximum precision 

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:53.319
 National cooperage has developed a complete line of products in each 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.079
 of them is all their experience and technology to achieve 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:59.939
 top quality elements 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:04.439
 this company has managed to be a strategic partner of the most important 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:07.749
 national destinations was referring 

00:04:07.749 --> 00:04:11.779
 three years we are working with fire please 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:17.419
 costa rica 11 adolfo competition finally the fifth of its value in the 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:18.829
 market 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.459
 gareca 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.990
 he has allowed us to do a specific development for young people 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.570
 allende de veracruz we only work with him 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.529
 in the first time 

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:30.789
 and all this came at least pass 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:32.509
 in 12 months in barrel 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:33.639
 Thus 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.999
 Laguarta and aging in a barrel of heroin 

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:42.309
 a key stage of our process because we believe that the use of barricade 

00:04:42.309 --> 00:04:45.909
 gives an objective contribution to young people 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:52.780
 that's why cost of living forgetting finding accepted curve in your work 

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:55.409
 specific 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:58.039
 to achieve real progress 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:02.710
 the new barrels are the ones that bring the most benefits to the wine and that is that 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.899
 After seven to nine years, the cigars of wood become clogged with what 

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:10.340
 prevents balanced oxidation and therefore 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.509
 there is a considerable decrease in the contributions of tan and cost of aromatics 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.440
 the aging of wine in barrels is a really complex phenomenon in which 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.270
 various processes are involved through which the wine is transformed by winning 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.800
 complexity and stability 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.420
 the degree of toasting 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.340
 determines to a large extent what the grill will look like to the wine during its 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.870
 stay the manufacturing process of the grill or says it allows to store 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:43.130
 all the roasting characteristics of each producer and repeat them again in 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:44.080
 time 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.250
