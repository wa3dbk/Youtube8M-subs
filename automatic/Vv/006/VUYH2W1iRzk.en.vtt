00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hi guys welcome to this video 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:12.480
 between talking about the features that will be 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:14.880
 available in max mavericks then but 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.039
 cosmetics will be the next system 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.520
 operating released by apple will come 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.039
 released to the public this fall e 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.380
 will have fantastic new ones 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:28.500
 innovations of the type as had already been 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.170
 expected to arrive maps on what is 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.180
 exactly the same thing that there is on 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.530
 on your iphone 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.809
 and this is a good thing with hoping 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.940
 also that my maps improve 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.270
 second thing is well integrated will be finder 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.050
 tabs what exactly does it mean you 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.980
 on a browser 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.020
 we could open several tabs on the 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.270
 finder to be able to go see different 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.780
 things in different places without having to open 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.000
 two different windows there finder 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.070
 in this way everything will be much more 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.559
 simple and quick thing that this was 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.360
 already possible as a program that 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.640
 you can find it around but I believe it 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.510
 will be released by default in the system 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:16.110
 operational third thing are the tags we can 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.460
 go and tag our documents for 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.920
 to be able to go and find so 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.509
 simple then put him I know if 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.850
 let's make a sports document we can 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.520
 go put the sports tag and then 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.080
 go find all these documents 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.780
 tagged in a simple and fast way 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.729
 through search of the finder to support 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.560
 to multiple displays since with 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.090
 full screen applications on a blanket in 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.640
 lion 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.060
 if you have multi p display it can be a 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.740
 big mess on the metrics there will be no more 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.149
 this problem because the applications 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.399
 that you will put in full screen 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.890
 on the second display it will not go but to everything 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:53.149
 screen on the first display and so on 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:57.719
 new advanced features such as 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:59.729
 a timer what singh what it means 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.740
 in practice if you go to see the 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.649
 Use the diagram of your cp you 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.390
 you will see peaks but if you go to 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.340
 add thing that you can't in short 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.539
 apple showed us well with gods 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.190
 different image 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.680
 in reality the c more is activated in 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.420
 continuation but it is also deactivated e 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.920
 so there are all the peaks in between 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.950
 tiny little ones of 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.900
 milliseconds and this type of operation 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.260
 what happens consumption a lot of 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.360
 battery and with this new feature 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.760
 timer koller singh all these 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.200
 operations that were once separate 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.470
 from a few milliseconds they will come 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.750
 grouped together to group together 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:40.980
 and this will really happen until 72 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.720
 percent of cpi use with too 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.299
 a great saving on the battery level 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.910
 second advanced option will be just ap 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:52.650
 napoli and sonnetta what it means 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:56.250
 that if you have an app in back 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.239
 basically that he is doing work for 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.250
 example I know 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.620
 you have a browser open with 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.380
 a flash animation that runs if there 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.720
 go and put another window on top 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.030
 the application on the background will come 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.980
 put in a sort of stand by and then 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.790
 the use of the cpu will go practically to 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.400
 zero 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.599
 of course this will not happen unless 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.880
 so you are compressing a video on will do 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:23.280
 cut pro and above put the window of 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.919
 safari this will not happen but with 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.630
 some types of applications that go to 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:29.790
 consuming a lot there is more without doing is 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.250
 born to nothing this will be very much 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.040
 useful will save you a job leave them more 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.079
 up to 23 percent then understanding 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.410
 that is, compressed memory died 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:41.960
 say that if you have 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.390
 dc desks more than sectors 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.780
 let's call them so 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.360
 simplistic 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.630
 some are active, others are inactive 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.750
 what happens that to change one 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.910
 slot in a sector beyond the ramp in 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.900
 adaptive active it takes time then 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:01.820
 what happens but which will compress the i 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:05.090
 inactive sectors to create more space 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:08.120
 for the application and therefore all 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.730
 operations that need a lot of ram 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.850
 they are very much faster even in the 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.920
 in which case you have ssd with 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:19.070
 mavericks and your computer will wake up 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.709
 from standby 1.5 times faster e 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.510
 will load files 14 times more 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.670
 quick the functions we are already 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.070
 used to using with the keychain on the 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:31.610
 max were moved to icloud e 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:34.790
 accessible from all your devices either 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:37.430
 if they are macbook and ipad iphone and in 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.520
 very simple way they will see access to 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.820
 your credit card data by 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.770
 password 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.690
 etcetera etc. on all yours 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.520
 devices also the sector of 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.890
 jean notifications will be touched by 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.630
 mavericks in the sense that now with the 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:54.080
 new system if you receive a notification 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:56.090
 example I don't know about twitter and you can if 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.580
 dal directly from the andara cloud 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:01.580
 to respond to that twitter or e- mail 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:04.370
 or to the facetime call is really 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.740
 really comfortable well this was more than that 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:10.400
 another summary of what it was 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:13.520
 presented with marco and matrix 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.140
 or rather, and stand mavericks system a 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.890
 moretto will be released in the fall 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:21.650
 and if you are a developer the demo la 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:26.410
 beta is already available since yesterday therefore 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.410
 no greeting to all to the next video
