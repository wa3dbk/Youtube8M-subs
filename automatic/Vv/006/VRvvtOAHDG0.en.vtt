ways that we can use maths on board the
ship<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.780> calculate<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.260> distance<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.739> the

we call tangents and we know from our
circle<00:02:26.680> theorem<00:02:27.099> that<00:02:27.579> a<00:02:27.640> tangent<00:02:28.180> is<00:02:28.390> always

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
circle theorem that a tangent is always

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.410 
circle theorem that a tangent is always
a<00:02:29.470> 90<00:02:29.980> degrees<00:02:30.250> at<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.489> center<00:02:30.879> of<00:02:31.030> a<00:02:31.209> circle

a 90 degrees at the center of a circle
when<00:02:31.810> it<00:02:31.930> hits<00:02:32.079> the<00:02:32.230> edge<00:02:32.319> of<00:02:32.470> a<00:02:32.530> circle<00:02:32.950> can

when it hits the edge of a circle can

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.430 
when it hits the edge of a circle can
therefore<00:02:33.879> say<00:02:34.299> that<00:02:34.510> this<00:02:34.599> point<00:02:34.870> here<00:02:35.140> and

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
therefore say that this point here and

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.140 
therefore say that this point here and
this<00:02:35.950> also<00:02:36.129> this<00:02:36.400> angle<00:02:36.700> here<00:02:36.970> 90<00:02:37.840> degrees<00:02:39.150> now

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
this also this angle here 90 degrees now

the object of the exercise is to

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:42.960 
the object of the exercise is to
calculate<00:02:41.590> obviously<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.400> distance<00:02:42.549> of<00:02:42.879> the

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
calculate obviously the distance of the

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.960 
calculate obviously the distance of the
visible<00:02:43.299> horizon<00:02:43.840> to<00:02:44.680> do<00:02:44.799> that<00:02:45.040> I<00:02:45.250> can<00:02:45.790> use

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
visible horizon to do that I can use

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.879 
visible horizon to do that I can use
this<00:02:46.299> distance<00:02:46.690> here<00:02:46.870> which<00:02:47.019> I<00:02:47.170> know<00:02:47.290> to<00:02:47.349> be<00:02:47.440> 39

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:47.889 
this distance here which I know to be 39

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:50.430 
this distance here which I know to be 39
meters<00:02:48.340> and<00:02:48.579> this<00:02:49.150> distance<00:02:49.510> here<00:02:49.810> which<00:02:50.139> is<00:02:50.409> a

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
meters and this distance here which is a

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.440 
meters and this distance here which is a
fixed<00:02:50.889> and<00:02:51.099> it's<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.549> distance<00:02:51.879> from<00:02:52.120> the

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
fixed and it's the distance from the

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.300 
fixed and it's the distance from the
center<00:02:52.750> of<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:52.959> earth<00:02:53.079> to<00:02:53.379> the<00:02:53.709> outer<00:02:53.950> edge<00:02:54.159> of

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310

center of the earth to the outer edge of
the<00:02:54.400> earth<00:02:54.519> the<00:02:55.120> radius<00:02:55.450> of<00:02:55.599> the<00:02:55.780> earth<00:02:55.810> and

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
the earth the radius of the earth and

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.440 
the earth the radius of the earth and
therefore<00:02:57.040> I<00:02:57.489> can<00:02:57.760> use<00:02:57.790> this<00:02:58.120> which<00:02:58.299> is<00:02:58.420> a

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
therefore I can use this which is a

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.180 
therefore I can use this which is a
right-angled<00:02:58.989> triangle<00:02:59.230> and<00:02:59.650> also

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
distance a be this distance can vary

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:07.680 
distance a be this distance can vary
considerably<00:03:06.310> depending<00:03:06.909> on<00:03:07.209> the<00:03:07.299> size<00:03:07.480> of

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690
