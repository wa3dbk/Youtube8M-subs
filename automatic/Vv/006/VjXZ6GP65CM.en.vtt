here it's it goes on the front of the
arm<00:00:16.000> and<00:00:16.330> it<00:00:17.080> goes<00:00:17.260> on<00:00:17.590> the<00:00:17.740> back<00:00:17.949> of<00:00:18.189> the<00:00:18.279> arm

range of motion issues or any

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.130 
range of motion issues or any
dislocations<00:00:36.489> of<00:00:36.760> the<00:00:36.940> joint<00:00:37.210> so<00:00:37.899> I'm<00:00:37.989> going

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
dislocations of the joint so I'm going

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.209 
dislocations of the joint so I'm going
to<00:00:38.199> ask<00:00:38.350> have<00:00:38.739> you<00:00:38.769> ever<00:00:38.920> had<00:00:39.069> any

00:00:39.209 --> 00:00:39.219 
to ask have you ever had any

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:41.130 
to ask have you ever had any
dislocations<00:00:39.850> of<00:00:39.969> your<00:00:40.089> joints<00:00:40.390> and<00:00:40.539> no<00:00:40.929> no

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
dislocations of your joints and no no

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.799 
dislocations of your joints and no no
okay<00:00:41.890> that's<00:00:42.100> good<00:00:42.399> so<00:00:42.670> if<00:00:42.909> this<00:00:43.329> person<00:00:43.569> had

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
okay that's good so if this person had

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:45.809 
okay that's good so if this person had
dislocated<00:00:44.440> his<00:00:44.530> shoulder<00:00:44.559> at<00:00:45.010> any<00:00:45.159> point<00:00:45.489> if

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:45.819 
dislocated his shoulder at any point if

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:47.369 
dislocated his shoulder at any point if
I<00:00:46.210> were<00:00:46.329> going<00:00:46.449> to<00:00:46.510> stretch<00:00:46.809> her<00:00:47.019> I<00:00:47.050> would<00:00:47.260> do

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
I were going to stretch her I would do

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.000 
I were going to stretch her I would do
it<00:00:47.469> extremely<00:00:48.129> gently<00:00:48.789> and<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:50.170> probably<00:00:50.679> would

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
it extremely gently and I probably would

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.349 
it extremely gently and I probably would
avoid<00:00:51.249> stretching<00:00:51.699> somebody<00:00:52.210> who's

00:00:52.349 --> 00:00:52.359 
avoid stretching somebody who's

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:55.410 
avoid stretching somebody who's
dislocated<00:00:53.049> in<00:00:53.170> area<00:00:53.710> honestly<00:00:54.249> just<00:00:55.239> stick

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
dislocated in area honestly just stick

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.059 
dislocated in area honestly just stick
with<00:00:55.539> massage<00:00:55.899> so<00:00:56.319> but<00:00:56.499> she<00:00:56.620> hasn't<00:00:56.829> had<00:00:57.039> that

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:57.069 
with massage so but she hasn't had that

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:58.619 
with massage so but she hasn't had that
problem<00:00:57.579> so<00:00:57.760> we're<00:00:57.879> just<00:00:57.909> gonna<00:00:58.149> start<00:00:58.449> with<00:00:58.510> a

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
problem so we're just gonna start with a

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:01.949

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.450 
get their elbow bent a little bit
slightly<00:01:10.620> you<00:01:11.620> don't<00:01:11.770> want<00:01:11.890> their<00:01:11.980> arm<00:01:12.160> to<00:01:12.250> be

slightly you don't want their arm to be

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.280 
slightly you don't want their arm to be
hyper<00:01:12.670> extended<00:01:13.420> because<00:01:13.630> that's<00:01:13.930> really

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
hyper extended because that's really

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:15.630 
hyper extended because that's really
uncomfortable<00:01:14.620> when<00:01:15.250> you're<00:01:15.340> stretching

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
uncomfortable when you're stretching

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.780 
uncomfortable when you're stretching
somebody<00:01:16.270> and<00:01:16.660> I'm<00:01:17.380> just<00:01:17.530> gonna<00:01:17.710> gently<00:01:18.250> pull

back and just very gently pull on the

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.050 
back and just very gently pull on the
muscle<00:01:25.870> and<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:27.100> can<00:01:27.250> even<00:01:27.400> do<00:01:27.640> this<00:01:27.790> up<00:01:28.030> to

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
muscle and you can even do this up to

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.670 
muscle and you can even do this up to
about<00:01:28.300> one<00:01:28.660> to<00:01:28.840> three<00:01:28.870> minutes<00:01:29.380> it<00:01:29.620> really

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
about one to three minutes it really

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.500 
about one to three minutes it really
stretches<00:01:30.160> the<00:01:30.460> fascia<00:01:30.760> which<00:01:31.240> is<00:01:31.270> the

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.510 
stretches the fascia which is the

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.990 
stretches the fascia which is the
connective<00:01:32.050> tissue<00:01:32.380> around<00:01:33.160> the<00:01:33.520> muscular

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
connective tissue around the muscular

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.110 
connective tissue around the muscular
system<00:01:34.720> and<00:01:35.100> it's<00:01:36.100> kind<00:01:36.400> of<00:01:36.430> like<00:01:36.550> the<00:01:36.640> casing

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
system and it's kind of like the casing

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.630 
system and it's kind of like the casing
on<00:01:37.300> a<00:01:37.360> sausage<00:01:37.690> basically<00:01:38.650> and<00:01:38.980> that<00:01:39.280> can<00:01:39.520> get

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
on a sausage basically and that can get

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.160 
on a sausage basically and that can get
really<00:01:39.790> tight<00:01:40.210> and<00:01:40.420> constricted<00:01:41.020> and

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
really tight and constricted and

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.450 
really tight and constricted and
uncomfortable<00:01:41.770> it'll<00:01:41.980> make<00:01:42.130> your<00:01:42.250> muscles

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
uncomfortable it'll make your muscles

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.570 
uncomfortable it'll make your muscles
have<00:01:42.760> a<00:01:42.820> hard<00:01:43.030> time<00:01:43.270> moving<00:01:44.250> okay<00:01:45.250> the<00:01:45.370> next

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
have a hard time moving okay the next

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:46.770 
have a hard time moving okay the next
thing<00:01:45.670> we're<00:01:45.880> gonna<00:01:46.000> do<00:01:46.240> is<00:01:46.480> we're<00:01:46.630> going<00:01:46.720> to

thing we're gonna do is we're going to

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.310 
thing we're gonna do is we're going to
stretch<00:01:47.080> that<00:01:47.380> way<00:01:48.159> so<00:01:49.020> we're<00:01:50.020> gonna<00:01:50.140> bring

stretch that way so we're gonna bring
the<00:01:50.440> arm<00:01:50.620> up<00:01:50.830> and<00:01:52.140> it's<00:01:53.140> the<00:01:53.260> same<00:01:53.470> concept<00:01:53.710> and

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
the arm up and it's the same concept and

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.580
