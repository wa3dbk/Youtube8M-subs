 the stars that are like that 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:16.980
 michelle gellar publication 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.939
 you know I believe or well as I chenot 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.999
 but I call you love waters not because the course is not good for PC 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:27.989
 recycled materials 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:30.989
 purchases on this day because a rim 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.640
 never tell friends contacts 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.040
 the many ministerial decrees 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.670
 coming 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.460
 Dr. Gelmini 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.290
 tidying up I don't get in trouble 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.170
 in fact one of the questions does not resolve 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.220
 and the question of our master's degree 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.770
 2 a hand to the specialist who does not know ligabue 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.030
 keep because they have changed 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.350
 the systems we call organizational that concern the orange professors 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.150
 It's a question it's a bit complicated 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.150
 we will try already explained several times 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.610
 sky anyway we can resume the conversation whenever you want 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.880
 the truth is that we can't make it - Milan 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.680
 2011 2012 looks for next academic year on which these days we are 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.200
 trying to present all the documentation that things go well 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.990
 end 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.780
 for the death of 2011 2012 we 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.850
 we do not answer for a specialist degree 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.060
 brake disc of course relate to coordination 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.360
 specialist with master's degree 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.750
 we are looking for these days, 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.660
 of the week after defining 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.400
 collaboration 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.650
 dr insert inside 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:48.600
 master's degree in political science. curriculum I have more easily address 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.270
 then lock them in communication 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.110
 policy 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.200
 and the collaboration with and so I decided policies was born and therefore 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.930
 we count as quickly as possible to avoid this hopefully good 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.380
 news 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.750
 with regard to ongoing 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.560
 you who know 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.560
 the president of marincea in office for four 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.439
 the maximum coals to do different things with you and coli obviously with the help 

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:16.719
 essential 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:19.249
 my colleagues are not there 

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:21.189
 I would like first of all that 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:23.369
 resume working together 

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:26.579
 orange students and teachers to organize 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.949
 the things I need most urgently are 

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:31.949
 a series of initiatives to meet companies 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:35.540
 most important of the hey salento of Puglia 

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:39.319
 italy if you can 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:45.149
 you but this I do not want to create a committee formed 13 23 30 presented 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.940
 then another thing that I care a lot about and that has been activated. positively 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:55.780
 during the first session of the teaching council I was able to chair 

00:02:56.369 --> 00:03:00.499
 the initiative in which degree course of communication sciences lecce in 

00:03:00.499 --> 00:03:01.889
 life 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.049
 this is Salento alive 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.250
 some presidents of drivers of particular prestige 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:10.569
 negative graduates from communication sciences 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:12.819
 that there are in this moment ita 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:15.719
 also on this blog I broke my teachers 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:16.949
 in just a few 

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:19.829
 the few days it forms before mapping 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.310
 assuming 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.310
 I invite you to our colleagues to the PC 

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:28.609
 i file the emotional question you might want to pay special attention to 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:30.899
 we 

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:34.919
 we had a degree course that had a troubled life just because 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:38.419
 we were told 

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:41.689
 representative of problems outside 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:43.819
 us inside 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:47.139
 the relationship between itp student teachers 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:50.589
 the quality of teaching and the quality of scientific research are 

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:53.969
 always been considered even for a guy all over where students 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.369
 again o 

00:03:57.369 --> 00:04:00.199
 what though fail to improve 

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:02.699
 is the place to port 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:06.649
 the closure of the cost of study in the sense that we hope it means 

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:07.239
 aura 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:08.619
 put in a hurry 

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:11.899
 possibly with excellent grades but above all in a hurry 

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:16.480
 not only because it is essential that there is a word in emergency of the course 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:19.949
 this is your personal Ligurian efficiency 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:21.629
 but also because for each 

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:23.210
 the student 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.210
 that goes as you choose in out-of-course jargon 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.669
 ministry operates 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:32.919
 sanctions against the university and the faculty it produces 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:35.569
 this dvd abstract figures 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:37.809
 let's say so lazy 

00:04:37.809 --> 00:04:41.359
 since we are aware that over the years the legal systems have changed 

00:04:41.359 --> 00:04:43.289
 sometimes on my martini 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:47.680
 number of credits ecm discipline medicine have disappeared have passed 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.210
 we would like to try to push 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.169
 proposing the following lineup 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:54.659
 in the hand 2010 2011 chat 

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:57.659
 the death of Marat 11 May starting in February 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.999
 the course teachers 

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:03.840
 an anna tatangelo love without makeup 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.310
 said they were in favor of intensifying the number of exam sessions 

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:11.789
 throughout the academic year ie up to 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:13.879
 we say at the end he tells me 

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:15.419
 of 2011 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:18.370
 so as to allow latecomers 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:19.699
 recover 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:22.189
 earth course of being able to say 

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:26.369
 presets present in faculty in the university as one of the courses you are looking for 

00:05:26.369 --> 00:05:28.120
 improve the relationship between 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.600
 current students for students out of course for the benefit of say normal 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.180
 administrative practices 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.770
 in general however beautiful we ask you to collaborate with this costs 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:41.639
 in general we ask you to contact your representatives 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.789
 elisabetta candido simone cat and antonella 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:48.620
 they are your representatives 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.529
 I asked them in particular for a commitment 

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:53.460
 eat so didactic 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.750
 because I can act as an intermediary between your needs and our needs 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.629
 pinko meet your needs 

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:03.450
 do not have any problem writing apples at 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.159
 call to meet them post opinion archive 

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:08.469
 both on your personal situation 

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:10.949
 so that they can go to our ears 

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:13.909
 even before your official documentation 

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:14.879
 needs 

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:18.129
 your asses with yours 

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:19.440
 and more if you want 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.639
 I, too, would have gone away angelically 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:24.129
 to suggest your representatives 

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:28.490
 bennet initiatives to do besides those that I had already put in the pipeline 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:29.770
 in conclusion 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:31.559
 our course works well 

00:06:31.559 --> 00:06:34.849
 it will work we still have the important thing better 

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:39.099
 that we often feel sorry if anyone knows about you from the top site 

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:40.779
 official this 

00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:44.079
 this one told me letter - moment like this in which every day 

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:47.289
 it is hard to close 

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:50.289
 the many combinations of cezanne card modules 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.699
 let's say lightning in the eyes 

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:57.610
 instead of writing maybe interiors 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.409
 it seemed to me like forming a weight tank 

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:02.809
 a question for a year 

00:07:02.809 --> 00:07:06.219
 teacher called for if he were not in communication sciences it seems to me 

00:07:06.219 --> 00:07:08.189
 you have no public way 

00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:10.809
 I greet you when we meet first 

00:07:10.809 --> 00:07:11.689
 take care of me
