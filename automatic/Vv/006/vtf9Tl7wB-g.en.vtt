00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.620
 Pauli YouTube was lucky and became another edition of Roisdorf 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.620
 small knot customer 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:17.970
 this time I show you pure Pollux PK also known as bowling in mountain sports 

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:22.239
 and this is about a loop 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.810
 to socialize that does not pull itself 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.880
 everyone's like 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.880
 I have always put a loop 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.930
 do I still guess such a small stuff here 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.870
 and behind 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.670
 Kurt Rohrig 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.070
 with the loose end 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.250
 in Trier 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.410
 the standing end 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.130
 and wants to go back 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.360
 already we have a simple one 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.800
 Neck laid 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.800
 or bulimia 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.770
 In my opinion, this is not the best Cameron quota system 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.960
 he may slip and possibly enlighten 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.590
 but that holds the noose for what pulls on the outside does not retreat 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.120
 okay, we last 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.510
 from simple bulin 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.510
 to just a few estate at one and a half times 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.000
 our sounds 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.250
 for the following 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.250
 here is the raft to its end 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.370
 on this page and goes on here 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.190
 by the first punishment 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.890
 and we already have 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.000
 one and a half times Polska Kroder Poulin 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.220
 Just cry 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.560
 and that's really the best and most reliable skew and the one you look for 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.620
 can imagine 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.899
 at the KSD 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.529
 DÃ¤ke daily not at all slips after a millimeter 

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:16.959
 very stable 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.489
 Blankenship one and a half times threatened simple situation between still to 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.199
 double 

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:25.329
 Signer joke 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:28.329
 again and again her triste easy pass way 

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:33.479
 Make Waldshut bigger 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:37.549
 just off as thick 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:50.360
 from the colorful double over and can lead back one-and-a-half times 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.959
 Bassist Robert Halver botched 

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:06.519
 and yet always a bit sigla and then I show you smoking and 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.169
 two-time 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:09.829
 Paris Sec 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:13.019
 There it happens to be used to put a vote 

00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:17.029
 View not to CEE under load 

00:03:19.529 --> 00:03:22.119
 Drugs most open doubt 

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:24.229
 so stand naturally as well 

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:26.429
 just a few Allstate 

00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:29.109
 completely back 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:32.109
 what the Complete is double 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:39.919
 and then it looks like this 

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:42.919
 Gunter Sachs has thanks to stable 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.099
 there is nothing left to change but something solid 

00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:00.259
 Guest guest Peter PaÃŸlick 

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:01.699
 NCA Poulin 

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:04.249
 in mountain sports 

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:07.249
 Do you do a little where you can see that 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:16.299
 double fitted 

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.879
