00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
they change dependent on the release and

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.509 
they change dependent on the release and
actually<00:03:22.920> these<00:03:23.100> are<00:03:23.340> these<00:03:23.940> are<00:03:23.970> white<00:03:24.420> but

actually these are these are white but
okay<00:03:26.519> few<00:03:26.970> more<00:03:27.209> things<00:03:29.150> air<00:03:30.150> marks<00:03:30.510> here<00:03:30.840> this

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
okay few more things air marks here this

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.530 
okay few more things air marks here this
the<00:03:32.250> bottom<00:03:32.610> riding<00:03:33.049> it's<00:03:34.049> far<00:03:34.500> too<00:03:35.090> low<00:03:36.090> it

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
the bottom riding it's far too low it

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.900 
the bottom riding it's far too low it
should<00:03:36.780> be<00:03:36.930> stretched<00:03:37.350> a<00:03:37.590> bit<00:03:37.620> more<00:03:37.950> as<00:03:38.730> you

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
should be stretched a bit more as you

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.530 
should be stretched a bit more as you
can<00:03:39.030> see<00:03:39.299> it's<00:03:39.450> much<00:03:39.739> bigger<00:03:40.739> here<00:03:41.269> it<00:03:42.269> says

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
can see it's much bigger here it says

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.160 
can see it's much bigger here it says
airmax<00:03:43.489> sort<00:03:44.489> of<00:03:44.579> squash<00:03:45.030> down<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:45.660> typeface

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
airmax sort of squash down the typeface

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:52.789 
airmax sort of squash down the typeface
here<00:03:47.540> you<00:03:48.540> can<00:03:48.720> see<00:03:48.989> here<00:03:49.410> how<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.310> mesh<00:03:51.799> it's

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
here you can see here how the mesh it's

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.069 
here you can see here how the mesh it's
running<00:03:53.130> straight<00:03:53.519> across<00:03:53.820> here<00:03:53.940> but<00:03:54.780> wearing

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
running straight across here but wearing

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.550 
running straight across here but wearing
me<00:03:55.230> to<00:03:55.350> this<00:03:55.470> part<00:03:56.360> see<00:03:57.360> it's<00:03:57.510> totally<00:03:58.079> not

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
me to this part see it's totally not

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.530 
me to this part see it's totally not
square<00:03:59.660> dead<00:04:00.660> giveaway<00:04:01.079> that<00:04:01.110> it's<00:04:01.380> a<00:04:01.470> fake

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.030 

the<00:04:05.379> material<00:04:05.980> feels<00:04:06.610> very<00:04:06.819> feldy<00:04:07.799> well<00:04:08.799> I

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
the material feels very feldy well I

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.610 
the material feels very feldy well I
think<00:04:09.370> a<00:04:09.549> lot<00:04:09.670> of<00:04:09.849> recent<00:04:10.420> mics<00:04:10.599> actually<00:04:11.409> feel

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
think a lot of recent mics actually feel

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.589 
think a lot of recent mics actually feel
like<00:04:11.650> that<00:04:12.010> so<00:04:12.549> maybe<00:04:12.849> that<00:04:13.030> isn't<00:04:13.239> the<00:04:13.299> best

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 
like that so maybe that isn't the best

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:19.620 
like that so maybe that isn't the best
way<00:04:13.840> to<00:04:14.129> detail<00:04:15.570> but<00:04:17.639> so<00:04:18.639> if<00:04:19.329> you<00:04:19.479> just

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
way to detail but so if you just

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.560 
way to detail but so if you just
remember<00:04:19.900> those<00:04:20.229> main<00:04:21.039> points<00:04:21.579> that<00:04:21.609> the

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
remember those main points that the

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.879 
remember those main points that the
world<00:04:22.840> it<00:04:23.050> in<00:04:23.190> tag<00:04:24.300> stitched<00:04:25.300> in<00:04:25.600> so<00:04:26.440> the

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
world it in tag stitched in so the

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:31.500 
world it in tag stitched in so the
dimples<00:04:27.539> underneath<00:04:28.539> the<00:04:28.720> insole<00:04:29.350> and<00:04:30.510> sort

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
dimples underneath the insole and sort

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:32.939 
dimples underneath the insole and sort
of<00:04:31.630> crappy<00:04:32.199> insole

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:32.949 
of crappy insole

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:36.379 
of crappy insole
they're<00:04:33.669> usually<00:04:34.080> best<00:04:35.080> ways<00:04:35.410> of<00:04:35.680> air

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
they're usually best ways of air

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:42.890 
they're usually best ways of air
spotting<00:04:37.389> the<00:04:37.539> fake<00:04:38.110> air<00:04:39.100> max<00:04:39.400> ones<00:04:41.460> this<00:04:42.460> one

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
spotting the fake air max ones this one

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.550 
spotting the fake air max ones this one
isn't<00:04:43.900> much<00:04:44.470> better<00:04:44.770> I<00:04:46.080> mean<00:04:47.080> if<00:04:47.229> you<00:04:47.350> look

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
isn't much better I mean if you look

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.620 
isn't much better I mean if you look
closely<00:04:47.979> probably<00:04:48.699> can't<00:04:48.970> see<00:04:49.800> a<00:04:51.389> lot<00:04:52.389> of<00:04:52.539> the

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
closely probably can't see a lot of the

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.560 
closely probably can't see a lot of the

should be hot perfect like this one

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.409 
should be hot perfect like this one
but<00:05:13.330> if<00:05:13.479> fakes<00:05:13.780> are<00:05:14.470> always<00:05:15.039> rubbish<00:05:15.580> and<00:05:16.240> that

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:16.419
