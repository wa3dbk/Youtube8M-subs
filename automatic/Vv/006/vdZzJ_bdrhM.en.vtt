them<00:04:45.470> in<00:04:45.650> these<00:04:45.830> situations<00:04:46.490> because<00:04:46.910> that's

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
them in these situations because that's

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.880 
them in these situations because that's
the<00:04:47.330> only<00:04:47.450> way<00:04:47.660> you<00:04:47.720> can<00:04:47.900> make<00:04:47.960> an<00:04:48.410> effective

like<00:04:51.229> this<00:04:51.500> is<00:04:51.710> actually<00:04:52.040> just<00:04:52.130> going<00:04:52.250> to<00:04:52.430> cost

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
like this is actually just going to cost
