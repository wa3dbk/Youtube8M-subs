00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.940
 hello friends my name is my israel blond 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.040
 and I want to share with you a topic of 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.020
 much importance that are the notes in 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.880
 the fretboard of the guitar then 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.730
 we started with this part of form 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.070
 graphic we have of the emotion donor 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.500
 chromatic we have everything every step 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.880
 is equivalent to a semitone then we continue 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.900
 here 2 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.969
 C sharp or D flat that's the same 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.070
 sound with different names 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.199
 that's called harmony when the same 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.309
 sound has different names then 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:44.129
 we have sharp or flattened then re 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:48.290
 always by halftone re sustained a 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:51.290
 less or equal sounds in harmonics me 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:55.880
 for natural fa sharp or just love 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:57.590
 sun sustained the flat the sustained or 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.280
 if flat that is the same sound each 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:03.920
 sound like that is the same but 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.590
 with different names and gone then 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.880
 here we have the names of the strings 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.770
 taking into account that we already have the 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.010
 order of the sounds and the name of the 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.630
 strings and let's hug the mold and 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.270
 chromatic when I speak of or the 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.390
 computer I speak for its editor we know 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.190
 and we understand that we were stepping on the 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.320
 frets the sounds are changing 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.720
 work we have first with lahm and 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.690
 then we started in the hard storage room 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.630
 it would be for because if after my 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:35.360
 glasses and from my country publisher that we have me 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:41.180
 for then for sustained 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:44.610
 sustained sun has sustained her if not a 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:47.280
 sharp re re sharp 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.830
 the beautiful ones back the number 12 when 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.020
 we got to the number 12 fret the fret 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.330
 number twelve of each string is called how 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.070
 it's called the rope to the air we have to 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.860
 the first string is called me and here it is 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.750
 call me also already reached the eighth the 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.960
 2nd string and then the number fret 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.930
 12 also be third with the same sun 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.990
 re the u and then what are we going to do 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.570
 this is how we were looking for the names 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.600
 from the first string we're going to do it from 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:18.510
 that the tails of more strings and we're going to 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.580
 find a sound for each string 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.910
 example in a sound in all 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.400
 strings we search are only the first 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.510
 rope, not that we did the 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.920
 Here, I'm going to be held up by the sun 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.350
 then we have on the first string 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.350
 we seek in which the second and if 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.170
 we do the process would be about here 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:44.070
 on third string to the air which is here 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.900
 back t5 fifth string fret ten and you 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:51.140
 pulled out of the three fret like the 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.140
 first then maria moix this with him 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:03:00.040
 ah 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:00.040
 oh and that's what we were looking for with the fa 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.260
 or not 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.260
 the king 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.680
 yes 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.650
 that's a fast and very effective way 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.060
