00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
leaking because the the heat cooling

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.130 
leaking because the the heat cooling
down<00:03:43.740> of<00:03:44.040> the<00:03:44.130> metals<00:03:44.630> but<00:03:45.630> since<00:03:45.810> I'm<00:03:45.990> going

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
down of the metals but since I'm going

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
on a bike boob ride it doesn't really

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.780 
on a bike boob ride it doesn't really
matter<00:03:49.550> as<00:03:50.550> long<00:03:50.580> as<00:03:50.850> you're<00:03:51.140> gonna<00:03:52.140> be

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
matter as long as you're gonna be

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:59.990

wasting<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:53.850> gas

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.830 

voicing<00:04:00.870> I<00:04:00.930> guess<00:04:01.080> using<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:01.740> gas<00:04:01.860> before<00:04:02.130> you

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:12.500 

I'm<00:04:06.050> going<00:04:06.200> to

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:20.740
