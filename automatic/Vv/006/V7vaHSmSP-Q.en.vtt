00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
the past 50 years so about once every 10

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.840 
the past 50 years so about once every 10
years<00:00:43.020> we<00:00:43.410> have<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.710> hurricane<00:00:43.950> making

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.490 
years we have a hurricane making
landfall<00:00:45.030> in<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.719> Gulf<00:00:45.899> Coast<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:46.350> it's

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
landfall in the Gulf Coast so it's

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.979 
landfall in the Gulf Coast so it's
certainly<00:00:47.100> not<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.760> common<00:00:48.300> occurrence<00:00:48.360> and

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
certainly not a common occurrence and

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
in the mid 80s and this is unfortunate

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.740

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
because we do think that hurricane opal

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.530 
because we do think that hurricane opal
won't<00:03:58.400> maintain<00:03:59.400> its<00:03:59.639> intensity<00:04:00.120> slowly
