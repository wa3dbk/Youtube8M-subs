then i'm going to put them all on to a
CD<00:01:59.670> or<00:01:59.700> something<00:01:59.880> like<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.450> I<00:02:00.960> don't<00:02:01.320> know

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
CD or something like that I don't know

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.550 
CD or something like that I don't know
yet<00:02:01.649> before<00:02:02.250> EA<00:02:03.210> stops<00:02:03.659> using<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.200> store

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
yet before EA stops using the store

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.760 
yet before EA stops using the store
hopefully<00:02:05.070> they<00:02:05.219> don't<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:06.020> then<00:02:07.020> so<00:02:07.229> here<00:02:07.590> is

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
hopefully they don't and then so here is
