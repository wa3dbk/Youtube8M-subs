00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.990
 Guys. Justin with AmericanMuscle.com, super excited because standing in front of one 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:09.830
 We have many 2015s. 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.900
 This is our 2015 Ford Mustang GT Performance Pack with the 50th anniversary appearance 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.440
 Pack. Now men, this will be just my first impression of the car fast with 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.610
 Dyno initial numbers and track times for the GT, so make sure to look for detailed reviews 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.140
 Coming your way very soon. Of course, sign up if you have not already done so. 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.930
 But again, this is just so gorgeous, right? These things are finally here. I feel 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.790
 We've seen this thing come a long way since last year. We saw all the early renderings. 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.040
 We all heard these rumors. We saw the release in New York, and now, finally come here on 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.960
 Studio, I one can not be more pumped. So again, let's dive into the head first. 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.280
 We will give you the first quick impression of the car. 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.250
 Let's start with this appearance pack. Now again, the 50th anniversary package has 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.579
 This brand of barbecue here throw to the fort early sixties. Not a huge fan 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.420
 Personally, I am more of a fan of fangs with a GT grill plant, but it works. It's for 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.739
 Very cool. Now, the 50th anniversary package also includes trim around the tail lights 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.899
 A nice badge on the deck panel will cover along with some other interior bits that will appear 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.329
 You guys in one minute, but let's dive under the hood because it is obviously the coyote motor 

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:11.829
 Back this year with some nice little improvements from the Boss 302. Now again, she added power 

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:17.259
 So far, 435, 400 in crank with this engine, do not look a little different below here 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.689
 The S197s, obviously some new plastic in that air box looks to be about half the size 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.289
 And S197, but overall of course, we are going to dive in. We're going to throw some power 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:28.249
 In this thing, see what can be done, but let's on the side of the car. I will show you 

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:31.539
 Some guys have those inner bits and talk a bit more about those Dyno numbers 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:32.179
 And tracking times. 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:35.799
 Of course, one of the big things with the performance pack, guys, these enormous six piston 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.359
 Calipers are here. The absolutely massive Brembo, the biggest we've ever seen on the Mustang, certainly 

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:43.759
 The preferred part of the performance package. Now again, players, you can quickly see back 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.329
 The car lines are really neat and black in the shop, but we'll open it a bit 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.329
 Little. We'll take a look at some of the 50th anniversary interior stuff. You can see it 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:57.319
 The type of embossed in the seats here and very comfortable seats. I'm telling you. For not being Ricardo, 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:00.609
 These seats really are a good grip. There is some great growth going on, and they are 

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:03.810
 Comfortable as you know what. They really like sitting in the big LA-Z-Boy. But I think one 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.149
 Of the biggest stories here, men, with 2015 is just an interior with leaps and bounds 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.709
 I have only S197 in every way, completely refined and quite modern, and again, just 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.099
 A good step forward. 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.129
 Now, so far the car drives great with the IRS, and again, I'll bring it over with 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:24.189
 We have a breakdown, but my initial impression just riding the car is much better than my S197. 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:28.829
 However, it does not work as good combustion as my S197. This wheel thing jumps like crazy. 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:33.540
 I mean right off the truck, you get a nice, depleted smoke with the thing, and the wheel hops 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.260
 OK, so we will fix it in the market after. Do not worry, but at the same time, just give 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.239
 You are my thoughts on that. 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.879
 So this is all about internal, men. Again, much better than S197, at least in my own 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.969
 Opinion, but let's get to the numbers that men just want to hear, right? Dyno numbers 

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:50.019
 And tracking times. The stock is heavy, and the trucks come down, put this thing down 370 horsepower 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.969
 And 353 lb-ft of torque on the rear wheels. Now, my companion and friend, Paul, are performing from Pama 

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:58.610
 He was on top of those runs through Daino and his and his crew were already working on the rhythms 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.670
 For this thing, be up to date on those very soon. 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.340
 As for those track times, as well as men, we did our two Mustang GT S550 down in the track, 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.939
 All of this black car along with our rivals Mustang GT orange and the best time of 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:15.030
 That night between two cars at 1301 at 110 miles per hour. All right, guys. As well, 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.120
 It is there you have for my fast collapse of the Mustang Mustang GT, O initial impression first 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.280
 Along with those numbers and Dyno times track. Now again, men, this is just the tip of the 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.209
 Iceberg. Make sure you keep an eye on that detailed review coming your way very soon
