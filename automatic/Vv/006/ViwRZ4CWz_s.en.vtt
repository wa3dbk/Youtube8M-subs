earphones now these earphones are pretty

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.000 
earphones now these earphones are pretty
different<00:03:03.569> from<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:04.260> standard<00:03:04.439> as<00:03:04.769> you<00:03:04.859> can

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
different from the standard as you can

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.050 
different from the standard as you can
see<00:03:05.159> they<00:03:05.280> actually<00:03:05.579> come<00:03:05.730> with<00:03:05.760> these

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
see they actually come with these

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.379 
see they actually come with these
cushions<00:03:07.049> and<00:03:07.549> they<00:03:08.549> seem<00:03:08.730> to<00:03:08.760> be<00:03:09.030> pretty<00:03:09.269> good

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.389 
cushions and they seem to be pretty good

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:11.960 
cushions and they seem to be pretty good
because<00:03:09.810> there<00:03:10.079> are<00:03:10.109> 12<00:03:10.409> but<00:03:10.650> upholds<00:03:11.159> to<00:03:11.790> this

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
because there are 12 but upholds to this

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.420 
because there are 12 but upholds to this
so<00:03:12.419> i<00:03:12.450> think<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.079> sound<00:03:13.500> should<00:03:13.709> sound<00:03:14.099> good

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
so i think the sound should sound good

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.110 
so i think the sound should sound good
it's<00:03:15.359> pretty<00:03:15.569> much<00:03:15.720> like<00:03:15.780> any<00:03:16.349> other<00:03:17.120> earphone

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
it's pretty much like any other earphone

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.080 
it's pretty much like any other earphone
