O like title
yep<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.840> reason<00:01:55.200> for<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.439> well<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.189> just

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
yep the reason for that well it just

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.740 
yep the reason for that well it just
gives<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.670> different<00:01:56.880> options<00:01:57.360> but<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.600> hook

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
gives you different options but the hook

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.330 
gives you different options but the hook
up<00:01:57.869> right<00:01:58.079> on<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.350> single<00:01:58.680> hook<00:01:58.740> is<00:01:58.890> very<00:01:59.100> good

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
up right on the single hook is very good

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.310 
up right on the single hook is very good
very<00:01:59.490> good<00:01:59.670> and<00:02:00.090> trout<00:02:00.509> buying<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.869> jumper<00:02:01.259> and

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
very good and trout buying a jumper and

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.649 
very good and trout buying a jumper and
a<00:02:01.409> Thrasher<00:02:01.710> can<00:02:02.100> throw<00:02:02.520> trebles<00:02:03.030> but<00:02:03.270> they

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
a Thrasher can throw trebles but they

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:13.650 
a Thrasher can throw trebles but they
tend<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.020> stay<00:02:04.259> stuck<00:02:04.560> on<00:02:04.740> on<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.950> single

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.260 

ah<00:02:14.660> how<00:02:15.650> about<00:02:15.680> that<00:02:16.130> challenge<00:02:16.640> if<00:02:16.760> tactic

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
ah how about that challenge if tactic

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.810 
ah how about that challenge if tactic
has<00:02:17.450> proven<00:02:18.230> to<00:02:18.530> be<00:02:18.560> very<00:02:18.680> very<00:02:19.280> fruitful

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
has proven to be very very fruitful

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:20.950 
has proven to be very very fruitful
you'll<00:02:20.030> notice<00:02:20.360> that<00:02:20.480> we're<00:02:20.630> no<00:02:20.780> longer

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
you'll notice that we're no longer

the<00:02:25.400> shore<00:02:25.700> we<00:02:25.910> thought<00:02:26.060> well<00:02:26.240> just<00:02:26.540> stop<00:02:26.810> and

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
the shore we thought well just stop and

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.170 
the shore we thought well just stop and
have<00:02:27.020> a<00:02:27.050> bit<00:02:27.170> of<00:02:27.200> a<00:02:27.290> cast<00:02:27.590> at<00:02:27.950> those<00:02:28.190> and<00:02:28.610> this

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
have a bit of a cast at those and this

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.210 
have a bit of a cast at those and this
is<00:02:29.390> proof<00:02:29.720> positive<00:02:30.230> Anthony<00:02:30.920> that<00:02:31.130> the

have to do a lot of guesswork and they
do<00:03:49.430> as<00:03:49.880> we<00:03:50.540> mentioned<00:03:50.959> cast<00:03:51.290> very<00:03:51.769> well<00:03:52.010> and

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
do as we mentioned cast very well and
