00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:30.230
 by the panini that type month came to 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:33.140

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.800

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.770

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.470
 nice set 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:45.370
 so what you are seeing is already 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:48.530

 there's a pretty cover 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:04.610
 follows the retro link style of the logo 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:07.040
 tide that famous uncle in the 90's and has 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:11.060
 those fancy effects seem to 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.069
 she was all crushed that impression 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.670
 to be an old thing have some marks 

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:19.729
 yellowish in the corners 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.759
 so it's an issue she 's an accomplice 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.709
 proposed to be historical and 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:32.029

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:36.770
 permeating the finishing of the editions of 

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:39.529
 front have camped behind only 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.109

 volume are four of captain america and 

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:54.969

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.969
 Avengers 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:04.009
 this collection it brings enough stories 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:07.659
 Fairy in Brazil that even in 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.659
 historical libraries marvel 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:14.209
 the volume of light with hard cover is a 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:18.640
 much more accessible collection is the 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:21.770
 editions have taken into account 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.800
 so for those who love claim is 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.330
 Very hard cover edition has no 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.120
 money 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:32.120
 this collection is interesting because it 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.580
 has a low cost for the acquisition and 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.610
 a selection of cool stories in the 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.310
 special adductor that has a lot of material 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.440
 that has been published in Brazil in recent 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.070
 times 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:50.210
 So let's open it and see how it is. 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:52.850
 be careful because although it is a box of 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:55.180
 Paper paper is not very resistant has 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:59.480
 that take some care 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:02.060
 here is a sub-layer and showing the 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:07.030
 layers of each volume as they came 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.030
 small but interesting detail 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:14.980
 inside 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.980
 the first is that of captain america 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.700
 the pretty brand cover does not want 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.700
 club 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.900
 according to the name is the doctor 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:39.880
 It's nice to note that the logos 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:43.210
 respect to that traditional 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:46.750
 logos that marvel had in the 70s 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:51.610
 80 and even years 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:55.780
 currently iron and last edition 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:58.140
 latest it came out of the conversation 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.140
 Avengers 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.620
 the paper printed on offset paper one 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.180
 paper is a bit thicker than in 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.800
 coated papers commonly used 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.050
 published stories 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.330
 so it smells good 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.040
 you come close to these 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:25.720
 issues 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:28.450
 I smelled the paper you loved there. 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:31.810
 going from each one is not something just to get one 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:35.740
 entrepreneur and put nose in 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:38.710
 read magazines but this interesting role 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:43.630
 because it is a role that stands out to him 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:48.520
 a lot of art because it is very white can 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:52.410
 to note that some of it is very good and 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:56.140
 how is a paper a heavier grammage 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:58.560
 It runs less risk day but there are those 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:02.800
 lives page 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:04.750
 so it's a magazine that sure enough she 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.990
 has the potential to last for years and 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.850
 years keeping the characteristics is not 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.900
 like that magazine that does not lie to you 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.970
 purchase 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:18.610
 after a while it turns yellow 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:22.780
 she's getting all doubled hurt 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:27.460
 despite being a low cost collection 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:32.080
 it has a very good finish, 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:36.760
 editions are all with square cover with 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:39.250
 good finish is has all the editions and 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:42.850
 follow a retro style 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:45.160
 let's write down these lines here she 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:49.480
 simulates aging 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:53.950
 pozzi, that's right. 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:06:01.420
 the covers are also a cool ones have 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:06:05.050
 that their comics backgrounds are a 

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:08.070
 collection that I found very well eita added 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.070
 much to the collectors 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:13.690
 interesting for those who do not 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:17.650
 character will be able to get to know a 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:26.140
 little historical context and a little bit 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:29.260
 origins as it is today that they cost 

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:33.670
 minimum 60 and 80 reais 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:38.710
 then every issue of this historical thing 

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:41.200
 marvel costs 22 97 the first of the captain 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:46.290
 America was launched with a 

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:46.290
 promotional 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:54.820
 As I said, you understand the four in the 

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:58.710
 last can is in banking but ends well 

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:58.710
 box to collect 

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:09.730
 so for those who like it too 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.590
 example of the movie Avengers 

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:14.200
 I would like to know a little more about the 

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:18.360
 The story of the group is to know a little 

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:21.640
 more the origins are very interesting 

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:24.970
 because it 's a collection she has a 

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:28.300
 excellent paper finishing too 

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:31.180
 interesting at a low price 

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:35.919
 then these motifs make a collection and 

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:37.330
 practically mandatory not only for 

00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:44.260
 older but for those who like a 

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:46.270
 good hq is a good request for you and wants 

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:48.810
 know the character not only 

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:48.810
 collect
