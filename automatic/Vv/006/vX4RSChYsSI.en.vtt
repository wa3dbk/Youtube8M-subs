00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:12.710 
over the last couple of weeks a lot of

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.109 
over the last couple of weeks a lot of
money<00:00:12.760> I<00:00:13.760> found<00:00:14.300> a<00:00:14.360> lot<00:00:14.510> of<00:00:14.660> busted<00:00:15.970> excuse<00:00:16.970> me

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:17.119 
money I found a lot of busted excuse me

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.560 
money I found a lot of busted excuse me
maybe<00:00:17.630> I<00:00:17.720> went<00:00:17.960> to<00:00:18.110> Gatti's<00:00:18.500> for<00:00:18.800> dinner<00:00:21.070> and

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.570 
maybe I went to Gatti's for dinner and

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.490 
maybe I went to Gatti's for dinner and
my<00:00:23.570> optical<00:00:24.260> mouse<00:00:24.470> broke<00:00:24.830> and<00:00:25.160> I<00:00:25.330> had<00:00:26.330> to<00:00:26.660> drag

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
my optical mouse broke and I had to drag

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.260 
my optical mouse broke and I had to drag
it<00:00:27.619> back<00:00:27.890> to<00:00:28.010> the<00:00:28.130> soldering<00:00:28.430> iron<00:00:28.760> room<00:00:29.029> and

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:29.270 
it back to the soldering iron room and

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.560 
it back to the soldering iron room and
try<00:00:29.510> to<00:00:29.570> figure<00:00:29.750> out<00:00:29.869> what<00:00:30.020> was<00:00:30.109> wrong<00:00:30.170> with<00:00:30.470> it

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
try to figure out what was wrong with it

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.630 
try to figure out what was wrong with it
my<00:00:32.570> computer<00:00:33.350> battery<00:00:33.680> had<00:00:33.860> broken<00:00:34.100> my<00:00:34.280> dad's

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
my computer battery had broken my dad's

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.790 
my computer battery had broken my dad's
oscilloscope<00:00:35.120> broke<00:00:35.600> then<00:00:36.230> I<00:00:36.379> had<00:00:36.530> all<00:00:36.650> these

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
oscilloscope broke then I had all these

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.140 
oscilloscope broke then I had all these
broken<00:00:37.070> things<00:00:37.430> around<00:00:37.519> I've<00:00:37.790> been<00:00:37.910> doing<00:00:38.090> a

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.150 
broken things around I've been doing a

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.860 
broken things around I've been doing a
lot<00:00:38.239> of<00:00:38.300> poking<00:00:38.809> around<00:00:38.960> to<00:00:39.769> try<00:00:39.980> to<00:00:40.600> see<00:00:41.600> where

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
lot of poking around to try to see where

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.210 
lot of poking around to try to see where
are<00:00:42.019> the<00:00:42.170> limits<00:00:42.589> of<00:00:44.290> what<00:00:45.290> can<00:00:45.559> I<00:00:45.650> fix<00:00:45.949> without

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 
are the limits of what can I fix without

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.219 
are the limits of what can I fix without
really<00:00:46.670> kind<00:00:46.909> of<00:00:46.970> knowing<00:00:47.479> that<00:00:47.510> much<00:00:48.019> about

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:48.229 
really kind of knowing that much about

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:51.009 
really kind of knowing that much about
it<00:00:48.589> but<00:00:48.799> just<00:00:49.040> by<00:00:49.190> being<00:00:49.460> intuitive<00:00:50.420> and<00:00:50.839> so

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:51.019 
it but just by being intuitive and so

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:52.360 
it but just by being intuitive and so
far<00:00:51.229> everything's<00:00:51.620> coming<00:00:51.920> together<00:00:52.010> pretty

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
far everything's coming together pretty

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.939 
far everything's coming together pretty
well<00:00:52.629> I<00:00:53.629> might<00:00:54.049> be<00:00:54.199> doing<00:00:54.409> dangerous<00:00:54.710> things

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
well I might be doing dangerous things

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:56.799 
well I might be doing dangerous things
so<00:00:55.400> don't<00:00:55.580> necessarily<00:00:56.180> do<00:00:56.299> these<00:00:56.479> things<00:00:56.720> at

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
so don't necessarily do these things at

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.649 
so don't necessarily do these things at
home<00:00:56.900> this<00:00:57.379> is<00:00:57.530> just<00:00:57.739> a<00:00:57.860> little<00:00:58.659> motion

00:00:59.649 --> 00:00:59.659 
home this is just a little motion

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:04.270 
home this is just a little motion
computing<00:01:00.460> tablet<00:01:01.460> computer<00:01:01.850> and<00:01:02.619> I<00:01:03.619> had<00:01:04.129> to

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
computing tablet computer and I had to

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.120 
computing tablet computer and I had to
run<00:01:04.430> it<00:01:04.549> off<00:01:04.670> of<00:01:04.820> a<00:01:04.940> see<00:01:05.080> all<00:01:06.080> the<00:01:06.650> time<00:01:06.940> because

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
run it off of a see all the time because

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.980 
run it off of a see all the time because
because<00:01:10.130> it<00:01:10.460> just<00:01:10.729> refused<00:01:11.210> to<00:01:11.510> charge<00:01:11.720> the

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
because it just refused to charge the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.740 
because it just refused to charge the
battery<00:01:12.549> the<00:01:13.549> way<00:01:13.670> I<00:01:13.700> have<00:01:14.030> been<00:01:14.270> running<00:01:14.600> it

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
battery the way I have been running it

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.840 
battery the way I have been running it
is<00:01:14.930> I've<00:01:15.079> just<00:01:15.229> been<00:01:15.350> running<00:01:15.500> a<00:01:15.710> little<00:01:15.859> DC

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
is I've just been running a little DC

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.209 
is I've just been running a little DC
input<00:01:17.270> to<00:01:17.420> this<00:01:17.539> thing<00:01:17.840> and<00:01:18.530> I<00:01:18.680> know<00:01:18.740> that<00:01:19.039> if<00:01:19.130> I

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:19.219 
input to this thing and I know that if I

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:21.789 
input to this thing and I know that if I
ran<00:01:19.430> 14<00:01:20.060> volts<00:01:20.329> of<00:01:20.390> DC<00:01:20.570> into<00:01:20.960> this<00:01:21.079> hole<00:01:21.350> the

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
ran 14 volts of DC into this hole the

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:24.279 
ran 14 volts of DC into this hole the
computer<00:01:22.219> would<00:01:22.369> work<00:01:22.549> I<00:01:22.850> just<00:01:23.420> had<00:01:23.570> a<00:01:23.600> 14<00:01:24.049> volt

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:24.289 
computer would work I just had a 14 volt

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:26.679 
computer would work I just had a 14 volt
battery<00:01:24.770> hooked<00:01:25.520> up<00:01:25.729> to<00:01:25.850> the<00:01:25.939> right<00:01:26.090> places<00:01:26.390> on

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
battery hooked up to the right places on

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:28.240 
battery hooked up to the right places on
that<00:01:26.869> I<00:01:27.109> would<00:01:27.289> think<00:01:27.320> it<00:01:27.560> would<00:01:27.679> work<00:01:27.710> and

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
that I would think it would work and

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.800 
that I would think it would work and
even<00:01:28.369> if<00:01:28.549> I<00:01:28.609> couldn't<00:01:28.820> find<00:01:29.119> the<00:01:29.390> right<00:01:29.420> places

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
even if I couldn't find the right places

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.099 
even if I couldn't find the right places
on<00:01:30.140> that<00:01:30.350> I<00:01:30.670> could<00:01:31.670> just<00:01:31.850> run<00:01:32.000> to<00:01:32.240> cave<00:01:32.479> two

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:33.109 
on that I could just run to cave two

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:34.599 
on that I could just run to cave two
wires<00:01:33.350> into<00:01:33.649> this<00:01:33.770> so<00:01:33.979> that<00:01:34.100> was<00:01:34.219> my<00:01:34.250> fallback

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:34.609 
wires into this so that was my fallback

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:36.639 
wires into this so that was my fallback
was<00:01:34.969> to<00:01:35.119> find<00:01:35.329> something<00:01:35.570> would<00:01:35.840> spit<00:01:36.109> out<00:01:36.170> 14

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
was to find something would spit out 14

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:39.989 
was to find something would spit out 14
volts<00:01:37.009> and<00:01:37.130> just<00:01:37.909> hook<00:01:38.509> it<00:01:38.539> up<00:01:38.749> to<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:39.320> whole

00:01:39.989 --> 00:01:39.999 
volts and just hook it up to the whole

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:42.279 
volts and just hook it up to the whole
ask<00:01:40.999> the<00:01:41.240> scientist<00:01:41.630> for<00:01:41.899> health<00:01:42.079> and<00:01:42.170> they

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:42.289 
ask the scientist for health and they

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:43.749 
ask the scientist for health and they
gave<00:01:42.409> a<00:01:42.469> very<00:01:42.590> good<00:01:42.710> advice<00:01:42.920> which<00:01:43.310> is<00:01:43.490> find

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
gave a very good advice which is find

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:45.760 
gave a very good advice which is find
another<00:01:44.450> one<00:01:44.570> of<00:01:44.689> these<00:01:44.810> on<00:01:44.960> ebay<00:01:45.320> that

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
another one of these on ebay that

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:46.810 
another one of these on ebay that
doesn't<00:01:46.070> do<00:01:46.159> anything<00:01:46.490> for<00:01:46.549> charged

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
doesn't do anything for charged

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.069 
doesn't do anything for charged
batteries<00:01:47.299> so<00:01:47.450> that's<00:01:47.600> a<00:01:47.689> really<00:01:47.719> good

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
batteries so that's a really good

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:52.300 
batteries so that's a really good
approach<00:01:49.090> but<00:01:50.090> I<00:01:50.299> wanted<00:01:50.570> to<00:01:50.960> I<00:01:51.619> wanted<00:01:51.950> to<00:01:52.189> get

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
approach but I wanted to I wanted to get

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.550 
approach but I wanted to I wanted to get
dirty<00:01:52.609> this<00:01:53.569> is<00:01:53.719> what<00:01:53.869> it<00:01:53.990> feels<00:01:54.020> like<00:01:54.319> you

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
dirty this is what it feels like you

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.139 
dirty this is what it feels like you
take<00:01:54.770> apart<00:01:55.069> something<00:01:55.490> that<00:01:55.609> already<00:01:55.759> worked

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
take apart something that already worked

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:57.940 
take apart something that already worked
but<00:01:56.509> you<00:01:56.600> have<00:01:56.719> to<00:01:56.869> just<00:01:57.079> kind<00:01:57.350> of<00:01:57.469> not<00:01:57.649> care

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
but you have to just kind of not care

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.620 
but you have to just kind of not care
too<00:01:58.219> much<00:01:58.249> and<00:01:58.670> you<00:01:58.729> have<00:01:58.819> to<00:01:58.939> find<00:01:59.179> the<00:01:59.359> seams

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
too much and you have to find the seams

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.719 
too much and you have to find the seams
in<00:01:59.929> it<00:02:00.079> and<00:02:00.200> pry<00:02:00.350> it<00:02:00.409> apart<00:02:00.530> there's<00:02:01.310> a<00:02:01.429> rule<00:02:01.700> of

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
in it and pry it apart there's a rule of

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.559 
in it and pry it apart there's a rule of
thumb<00:02:01.909> that<00:02:02.359> if<00:02:02.929> something<00:02:03.140> has<00:02:04.390> more<00:02:05.390> than

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:05.569 
thumb that if something has more than

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:07.480 
thumb that if something has more than
two<00:02:05.780> screws<00:02:06.229> or<00:02:06.530> maybe<00:02:06.829> it's<00:02:07.009> four<00:02:07.189> screws

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
two screws or maybe it's four screws

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.639 
two screws or maybe it's four screws
that<00:02:07.700> it's<00:02:07.880> not<00:02:07.969> meant<00:02:08.210> to<00:02:08.300> come<00:02:08.479> apart<00:02:08.780> and<00:02:09.530> I

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
that it's not meant to come apart and I

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.740 
that it's not meant to come apart and I
guess<00:02:09.800> if<00:02:09.950> it<00:02:10.039> has<00:02:10.160> no<00:02:10.340> screws<00:02:10.670> it's<00:02:11.180> really

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
guess if it has no screws it's really

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.510 
guess if it has no screws it's really
not<00:02:11.870> meant<00:02:12.080> to<00:02:12.170> come<00:02:12.319> apart<00:02:12.590> but<00:02:13.310> they're

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
not meant to come apart but they're

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.450 
not meant to come apart but they're
really<00:02:13.700> not<00:02:14.060> that<00:02:14.780> daunting<00:02:15.220> battery<00:02:16.220> packs

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
really not that daunting battery packs

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.330 
really not that daunting battery packs
just<00:02:16.580> look<00:02:16.880> like<00:02:16.959> packs<00:02:17.959> with<00:02:18.230> batteries<00:02:19.159> in

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
just look like packs with batteries in

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.870 
just look like packs with batteries in
them

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
them

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.840 
them
so<00:02:20.750> once<00:02:21.560> you<00:02:21.680> get<00:02:21.800> that<00:02:21.920> apart<00:02:22.280> you<00:02:22.490> can<00:02:22.640> see

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
so once you get that apart you can see

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.460 
so once you get that apart you can see
it's<00:02:23.300> all<00:02:23.540> battery<00:02:23.930> II<00:02:25.330> but<00:02:26.330> what<00:02:26.630> really<00:02:26.960> was

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
it's all battery II but what really was

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.580 
it's all battery II but what really was
curious<00:02:28.100> to<00:02:28.130> me<00:02:28.430> is<00:02:28.580> why<00:02:29.390> all<00:02:29.660> that<00:02:29.690> circuitry

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
curious to me is why all that circuitry

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:38.440 
curious to me is why all that circuitry
and<00:02:33.700> what<00:02:34.700> I<00:02:34.990> figure<00:02:35.990> is<00:02:36.550> that<00:02:37.550> they've<00:02:38.300> got

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
and what I figure is that they've got

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.170 
and what I figure is that they've got
taps<00:02:39.050> going<00:02:39.530> in<00:02:39.680> there's<00:02:39.890> there's<00:02:40.550> wires<00:02:40.910> not

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
taps going in there's there's wires not

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.640 
taps going in there's there's wires not
just<00:02:41.390> connected<00:02:41.750> to<00:02:41.840> that<00:02:41.960> end<00:02:42.170> in<00:02:42.260> that<00:02:42.440> and

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
just connected to that end in that and

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.930 
just connected to that end in that and
their<00:02:42.770> wires<00:02:42.980> going<00:02:43.280> to<00:02:43.370> the<00:02:43.520> spots<00:02:43.760> between

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
their wires going to the spots between

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.700 
their wires going to the spots between
the<00:02:44.210> batteries<00:02:44.600> so<00:02:45.140> that<00:02:45.290> means<00:02:45.440> that<00:02:45.590> they're

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
the batteries so that means that they're

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.230 
the batteries so that means that they're
getting<00:02:45.800> different<00:02:46.130> voltages<00:02:46.760> out<00:02:46.940> of<00:02:47.090> there

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
getting different voltages out of there

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.270 
getting different voltages out of there
and<00:02:47.870> they're<00:02:48.020> doing<00:02:48.200> some<00:02:48.410> computations<00:02:49.100> to

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
and they're doing some computations to

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.730 
and they're doing some computations to
decide<00:02:49.580> when<00:02:49.790> to<00:02:49.820> send<00:02:50.240> how<00:02:50.780> much<00:02:51.050> voltage<00:02:51.290> to

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
decide when to send how much voltage to

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.410 
decide when to send how much voltage to
which<00:02:51.890> part<00:02:52.100> of<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.280> circuit<00:02:52.640> in<00:02:52.760> here<00:02:52.970> and

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
which part of the circuit in here and

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.570 
which part of the circuit in here and
that<00:02:53.540> probably<00:02:53.780> helps<00:02:54.200> a<00:02:54.290> lot<00:02:54.560> for<00:02:55.220> battery

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
that probably helps a lot for battery

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.870 
that probably helps a lot for battery
life<00:02:55.820> but<00:02:56.420> why<00:02:56.660> wouldn't<00:02:56.990> this<00:02:57.140> charge<00:02:57.500> and

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
life but why wouldn't this charge and

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.360 
life but why wouldn't this charge and
all<00:02:58.880> I<00:02:58.940> could<00:02:59.210> think<00:02:59.360> was<00:02:59.720> that<00:03:00.380> they've<00:03:01.160> got

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
all I could think was that they've got

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.590 
all I could think was that they've got
some<00:03:01.670> kind<00:03:01.700> of<00:03:02.000> a<00:03:02.120> cute<00:03:02.390> circuit<00:03:02.840> in<00:03:02.990> here<00:03:03.550> that

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
some kind of a cute circuit in here that

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.410 
some kind of a cute circuit in here that
maybe<00:03:05.800> wants<00:03:06.800> to<00:03:06.950> make<00:03:07.160> sure<00:03:07.270> that<00:03:08.270> there

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
maybe wants to make sure that there

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.180 
maybe wants to make sure that there
really<00:03:08.690> is<00:03:08.840> a<00:03:09.020> battery<00:03:09.410> hookup<00:03:09.860> to<00:03:10.040> this

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
really is a battery hookup to this

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.710 
really is a battery hookup to this
before<00:03:10.550> they<00:03:10.670> send<00:03:10.880> a<00:03:11.000> bunch<00:03:11.120> of<00:03:11.240> juice<00:03:11.480> to<00:03:11.690> it

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
before they send a bunch of juice to it

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.780 
before they send a bunch of juice to it
if<00:03:12.560> they<00:03:12.680> send<00:03:12.890> a<00:03:12.950> bunch<00:03:13.070> of<00:03:13.190> juice<00:03:13.370> to<00:03:13.550> it<00:03:13.580> and

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
if they send a bunch of juice to it and

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:14.770 
if they send a bunch of juice to it and
you're<00:03:13.910> touching<00:03:14.180> it<00:03:14.270> with<00:03:14.390> your<00:03:14.510> finger<00:03:14.750> or

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
you're touching it with your finger or

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.220 
you're touching it with your finger or
your<00:03:14.930> tongue<00:03:15.260> they<00:03:15.890> get<00:03:16.070> sued<00:03:16.340> so<00:03:17.090> I<00:03:17.120> i<00:03:17.870> just

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
your tongue they get sued so I i just

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.260 
your tongue they get sued so I i just
used<00:03:18.440> that<00:03:18.620> as<00:03:19.010> my<00:03:19.160> hypothesis<00:03:19.850> and<00:03:19.970> I<00:03:20.030> really

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
used that as my hypothesis and I really

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.390 
used that as my hypothesis and I really
don't<00:03:20.450> know<00:03:20.570> that<00:03:20.660> it's<00:03:20.960> right<00:03:21.170> I<00:03:21.410> measured<00:03:22.250> it

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
don't know that it's right I measured it

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.990 
don't know that it's right I measured it
and<00:03:22.580> it<00:03:23.240> came<00:03:23.420> out<00:03:23.660> really<00:03:24.410> really<00:03:24.770> dead<00:03:25.430> it

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
and it came out really really dead it

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.300 
and it came out really really dead it
was<00:03:26.270> it<00:03:26.480> looked<00:03:27.020> like<00:03:27.110> it<00:03:27.290> was<00:03:27.410> it<00:03:27.980> was<00:03:28.130> about

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
was it looked like it was it was about

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.810 
was it looked like it was it was about
six<00:03:29.090> volts<00:03:29.420> or<00:03:29.510> something<00:03:29.900> so<00:03:30.860> I<00:03:31.220> figured<00:03:31.760> I

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
six volts or something so I figured I

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.130 
six volts or something so I figured I
had<00:03:32.000> to<00:03:32.120> charge<00:03:32.390> it<00:03:32.570> up<00:03:32.630> so<00:03:32.810> that<00:03:32.960> it<00:03:33.020> would

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
had to charge it up so that it would

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.750 
had to charge it up so that it would
look<00:03:33.320> like<00:03:33.560> a<00:03:33.620> real<00:03:33.860> battery<00:03:34.250> in<00:03:34.430> order<00:03:34.610> for

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
look like a real battery in order for

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.940 
look like a real battery in order for
this<00:03:34.820> thing<00:03:35.030> to<00:03:35.150> recognize<00:03:35.300> it<00:03:35.870> so<00:03:36.680> I<00:03:36.710> got<00:03:37.100> I

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
this thing to recognize it so I got I

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.030 
this thing to recognize it so I got I
asked<00:03:39.950> around<00:03:40.040> and<00:03:40.810> my<00:03:41.810> buddy<00:03:42.050> Kevin<00:03:42.350> has<00:03:42.740> one

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
asked around and my buddy Kevin has one

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.740 
asked around and my buddy Kevin has one
of<00:03:43.160> these<00:03:43.280> little<00:03:43.490> battery<00:03:43.910> trickle<00:03:44.330> chargers

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
of these little battery trickle chargers

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.680 
of these little battery trickle chargers
for<00:03:44.930> a<00:03:45.020> car<00:03:45.260> and<00:03:45.760> I<00:03:46.760> thought<00:03:47.060> well<00:03:47.210> a<00:03:47.270> car<00:03:47.540> is

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
for a car and I thought well a car is

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.960 
for a car and I thought well a car is
big<00:03:47.930> in<00:03:48.200> a<00:03:48.230> laptop<00:03:48.890> is<00:03:49.040> small<00:03:49.340> and<00:03:49.610> it'll<00:03:49.820> blow

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
big in a laptop is small and it'll blow

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.390 
big in a laptop is small and it'll blow
it<00:03:50.120> up<00:03:50.240> I<00:03:50.510> looked<00:03:51.350> at<00:03:51.500> it<00:03:51.530> but<00:03:51.860> the<00:03:52.070> numbers

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
it up I looked at it but the numbers

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.090 
it up I looked at it but the numbers
seem<00:03:52.640> small<00:03:53.090> and<00:03:53.290> just<00:03:54.290> got<00:03:54.440> a<00:03:54.470> trickle<00:03:54.860> charge

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
seem small and just got a trickle charge

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.890 
seem small and just got a trickle charge
and<00:03:55.370> i<00:03:55.430> figured<00:03:55.700> i<00:03:55.760> could<00:03:55.790> if<00:03:56.540> i<00:03:56.690> start

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
and i figured i could if i start

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.630 
and i figured i could if i start
smelling<00:03:57.170> something<00:03:57.560> nasty<00:03:58.100> i<00:03:58.130> could<00:03:58.340> run<00:03:58.490> out

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
smelling something nasty i could run out

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.160 
smelling something nasty i could run out
of<00:03:58.700> the<00:03:58.850> room<00:03:58.880> i<00:03:59.360> got<00:03:59.900> a<00:03:59.930> fire<00:04:00.140> extinguisher

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
of the room i got a fire extinguisher

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.190 
of the room i got a fire extinguisher
ready<00:04:00.890> and<00:04:01.520> i<00:04:01.940> just<00:04:02.120> put<00:04:02.480> this<00:04:02.630> up<00:04:02.840> to<00:04:02.959> where<00:04:03.110> it

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
ready and i just put this up to where it

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.690 
ready and i just put this up to where it
seemed<00:04:03.500> like<00:04:03.680> it<00:04:03.830> ought<00:04:03.920> to<00:04:03.950> go<00:04:04.160> front<00:04:04.580> in<00:04:04.640> the

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
seemed like it ought to go front in the

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.240 
seemed like it ought to go front in the
back<00:04:04.730> of<00:04:05.000> the<00:04:05.060> battery<00:04:05.390> I<00:04:05.740> used<00:04:06.740> alligator

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
back of the battery I used alligator

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.190 
back of the battery I used alligator
clips<00:04:07.520> and<00:04:07.760> I<00:04:08.240> love<00:04:08.390> to<00:04:08.480> hold<00:04:08.630> meter<00:04:08.840> on<00:04:09.020> there

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
clips and I love to hold meter on there

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.750 
clips and I love to hold meter on there
just<00:04:09.380> to<00:04:09.470> see<00:04:09.620> what<00:04:09.740> would<00:04:09.770> happen<00:04:10.010> so<00:04:10.400> that<00:04:10.550> so

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
just to see what would happen so that so

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.760 
just to see what would happen so that so
that<00:04:10.790> you<00:04:11.300> know<00:04:11.390> if<00:04:11.540> if<00:04:12.020> they<00:04:12.200> started<00:04:12.560> hitting

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 
that you know if if they started hitting

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.550 
that you know if if they started hitting
the<00:04:12.800> pegs<00:04:13.180> then<00:04:14.180> I<00:04:14.270> could<00:04:14.480> I<00:04:14.690> could<00:04:14.930> run<00:04:15.350> and

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
the pegs then I could I could run and

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.949 
the pegs then I could I could run and
scream<00:04:15.709> a<00:04:15.830> call<00:04:16.100> the<00:04:16.220> cops<00:04:16.430> and<00:04:16.700> i<00:04:17.510> charged<00:04:17.840> it

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
scream a call the cops and i charged it

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.800 
scream a call the cops and i charged it
up<00:04:18.109> got<00:04:18.830> to<00:04:19.010> back<00:04:19.190> in<00:04:19.370> the<00:04:19.459> computer<00:04:19.910> it<00:04:20.450> came

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
up got to back in the computer it came

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.720 
up got to back in the computer it came
up<00:04:20.989> I<00:04:21.170> don't<00:04:21.680> know<00:04:21.770> why<00:04:21.920> it<00:04:21.980> came<00:04:22.250> up<00:04:22.400> with<00:04:22.520> very

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
up I don't know why it came up with very

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.690 
up I don't know why it came up with very
low<00:04:23.060> voltage<00:04:23.690> and<00:04:24.350> it<00:04:24.440> was<00:04:24.560> enough<00:04:24.830> voltage<00:04:25.280> if

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
low voltage and it was enough voltage if

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.130 
low voltage and it was enough voltage if
the<00:04:26.090> computer<00:04:26.480> could<00:04:26.600> see<00:04:26.810> it<00:04:26.930> and<00:04:27.020> it<00:04:27.080> was

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
the computer could see it and it was

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.200 
the computer could see it and it was
able<00:04:27.410> to<00:04:27.500> charge<00:04:27.740> it<00:04:27.860> up<00:04:27.950> and<00:04:28.400> it<00:04:28.580> fixed<00:04:28.880> it<00:04:29.000> and

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
able to charge it up and it fixed it and

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.500 
able to charge it up and it fixed it and
I'm<00:04:29.570> very<00:04:29.720> proud<00:04:29.930> of<00:04:30.050> myself<00:04:30.340> so<00:04:31.340> and<00:04:31.940> and<00:04:32.270> not

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
I'm very proud of myself so and and not

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:33.730 
I'm very proud of myself so and and not
with<00:04:32.660> any<00:04:32.780> good<00:04:32.990> reason<00:04:33.140> because<00:04:33.320> i<00:04:33.470> really

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
with any good reason because i really

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.790 
with any good reason because i really
don't<00:04:33.950> know<00:04:34.010> why<00:04:34.250> it<00:04:34.310> worked<00:04:34.780> but<00:04:35.780> i<00:04:36.020> guess<00:04:36.650> i

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
don't know why it worked but i guess i

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.690 
don't know why it worked but i guess i
guess<00:04:37.100> either<00:04:37.370> in<00:04:37.970> the<00:04:38.120> spirit<00:04:38.930> of<00:04:39.080> promoting

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
guess either in the spirit of promoting

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.240 
guess either in the spirit of promoting
exploration<00:04:41.410> that's<00:04:42.410> how<00:04:42.590> i<00:04:42.620> approach<00:04:42.860> this

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
exploration that's how i approach this

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.850 
exploration that's how i approach this
problem<00:04:43.460> and<00:04:43.760> that's<00:04:43.910> how<00:04:44.060> I<00:04:44.090> successfully

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
problem and that's how I successfully

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:59.250 
problem and that's how I successfully
let<00:04:45.860> nature<00:04:46.280> solving<00:04:46.970> back<00:04:47.930> to<00:04:48.080> you<00:04:48.169> Jerry

and<00:05:00.260> you<00:05:00.650> didn't<00:05:00.980> snow<00:05:01.280> any<00:05:01.580> smoke<00:05:01.970> I'm<00:05:02.210> so

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:02.420 
and you didn't snow any smoke I'm so

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.730 
and you didn't snow any smoke I'm so
disappointed<00:05:02.630> George<00:05:03.410> no<00:05:04.130> I<00:05:04.610> didn't<00:05:05.270> and<00:05:05.740> I'm

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
disappointed George no I didn't and I'm

disappointed George no I didn't and I'm
a<00:05:07.010> little<00:05:07.490> disappointed<00:05:07.760> myself<00:05:08.470> oh<00:05:10.120> but

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
a little disappointed myself oh but

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.270 
a little disappointed myself oh but
Jerry<00:05:12.610> here's<00:05:13.610> the<00:05:13.790> other<00:05:14.060> battery<00:05:15.070> that<00:05:16.070> goes

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
Jerry here's the other battery that goes

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.130 
Jerry here's the other battery that goes
on<00:05:16.580> the<00:05:16.760> back<00:05:17.000> of<00:05:17.060> it<00:05:17.330> the<00:05:17.480> auxiliary<00:05:17.930> battery

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:18.140 
on the back of it the auxiliary battery

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.820 
on the back of it the auxiliary battery
and<00:05:19.510> yeah<00:05:20.510> I<00:05:20.540> did<00:05:20.960> hook<00:05:21.170> that<00:05:21.410> one<00:05:21.590> up<00:05:21.710> and

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
and yeah I did hook that one up and

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.520 
and yeah I did hook that one up and
tried<00:05:22.040> to<00:05:22.130> do<00:05:22.250> the<00:05:22.370> same<00:05:22.400> thing<00:05:22.760> with<00:05:22.910> it<00:05:23.090> and

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
tried to do the same thing with it and

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.000 
tried to do the same thing with it and
now<00:05:24.530> when<00:05:25.340> i<00:05:25.370> plug<00:05:25.700> this<00:05:25.880> into<00:05:26.150> the<00:05:26.330> computer

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010 
now when i plug this into the computer

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:32.290 
now when i plug this into the computer
the<00:05:28.010> computer<00:05:29.230> works<00:05:30.230> fine<00:05:30.500> until<00:05:31.040> it<00:05:31.160> has<00:05:32.090> to

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
the computer works fine until it has to

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.760 
the computer works fine until it has to
think<00:05:32.450> about<00:05:32.720> this<00:05:32.840> battery<00:05:33.260> so<00:05:33.440> if<00:05:33.530> you<00:05:33.620> like

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
think about this battery so if you like

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.260 
think about this battery so if you like
till<00:05:34.010> the<00:05:34.100> software<00:05:34.520> hey<00:05:34.940> how<00:05:35.120> much

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
till the software hey how much

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.330 
till the software hey how much
electricity<00:05:35.330> is<00:05:35.930> on<00:05:36.020> that<00:05:36.200> battery<00:05:36.560> it<00:05:37.130> goes

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
electricity is on that battery it goes

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:42.730 
electricity is on that battery it goes
hmm<00:05:37.910> and<00:05:38.390> the<00:05:38.480> whole<00:05:38.660> thing<00:05:38.720> just<00:05:39.050> died<00:05:39.470> so<00:05:41.740> I

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 
hmm and the whole thing just died so I

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.270 
hmm and the whole thing just died so I
have<00:05:43.190> no<00:05:43.430> idea<00:05:43.840> why<00:05:44.840> but<00:05:45.470> what<00:05:45.650> I've<00:05:45.770> got<00:05:45.950> to<00:05:45.980> do

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
have no idea why but what I've got to do

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.670 
have no idea why but what I've got to do
we've<00:05:47.180> got<00:05:47.300> to<00:05:47.390> take<00:05:47.570> this<00:05:47.690> one<00:05:47.750> apart<00:05:48.170> I'm

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
we've got to take this one apart I'm

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.560 
we've got to take this one apart I'm
going<00:05:48.830> to<00:05:48.920> find<00:05:49.130> the<00:05:49.250> analogous<00:05:49.730> circuits<00:05:50.330> in

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:50.570 
going to find the analogous circuits in

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.090 
going to find the analogous circuits in
this<00:05:50.780> as<00:05:51.020> to<00:05:51.530> that<00:05:51.650> because<00:05:51.770> I've<00:05:51.920> got<00:05:52.040> a

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.100 
this as to that because I've got a

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.010 
this as to that because I've got a
working<00:05:52.310> one<00:05:52.550> in<00:05:52.700> a<00:05:52.790> not<00:05:52.970> working<00:05:53.300> one<00:05:53.480> and<00:05:53.930> I'm

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 
working one in a not working one and I'm

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.240
