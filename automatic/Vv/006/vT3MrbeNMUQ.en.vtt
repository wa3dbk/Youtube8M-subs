let's<00:03:32.780> make<00:03:33.019> some<00:03:33.290> sticks<00:03:33.769> I'm<00:03:34.190> gonna<00:03:34.489> make<00:03:34.580> 20

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
let's make some sticks I'm gonna make 20

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.930 
let's make some sticks I'm gonna make 20
sticks<00:03:35.920> and<00:03:36.920> then<00:03:37.190> this<00:03:37.400> is<00:03:37.579> just<00:03:37.610> how<00:03:37.880> to

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
sticks and then this is just how to

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.900 
sticks and then this is just how to
craft<00:03:38.269> the<00:03:38.450> basic<00:03:38.840> tool<00:03:39.079> so<00:03:39.350> you<00:03:39.470> want<00:03:39.620> to<00:03:39.709> put

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
craft the basic tool so you want to put

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.759 
craft the basic tool so you want to put
clutch<00:03:40.910> sticking<00:03:41.540> like<00:03:41.660> that

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
clutch sticking like that

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:47.170 
clutch sticking like that
now<00:03:43.700> to<00:03:43.760> make<00:03:43.970> a<00:03:44.030> rake<00:03:44.980> you<00:03:45.980> do<00:03:46.130> like<00:03:46.340> that<00:03:46.370> you

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
now to make a rake you do like that you

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.500 
now to make a rake you do like that you
can<00:03:47.360> have<00:03:47.390> any<00:03:47.930> sort<00:03:48.230> of<00:03:48.380> India<00:03:48.950> there<00:03:49.910> where

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
can have any sort of India there where

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.190 
can have any sort of India there where
the<00:03:50.630> two<00:03:50.840> wooden<00:03:51.200> planks<00:03:51.230> are<00:03:51.829> I<00:03:52.790> am<00:03:53.540> a<00:03:53.570> ruby

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
the two wooden planks are I am a ruby

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.850 
the two wooden planks are I am a ruby
and<00:03:54.320> stuff<00:03:54.560> I<00:03:54.680> guess<00:03:55.750> that<00:03:56.750> should<00:03:56.959> work<00:03:57.200> you

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
and stuff I guess that should work you

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.710 
and stuff I guess that should work you
can<00:03:58.250> just<00:03:58.280> drag<00:03:58.549> it<00:03:58.730> into<00:03:58.820> inventory<00:03:59.180> and

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
can just drag it into inventory and

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.280 
can just drag it into inventory and
suppose<00:04:00.440> I<00:04:00.470> have<00:04:00.650> a<00:04:00.680> shovel<00:04:01.840> which<00:04:02.840> is<00:04:03.079> the

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
suppose I have a shovel which is the

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.699 
suppose I have a shovel which is the
same<00:04:03.530> as<00:04:03.799> minecraft<00:04:04.280> and<00:04:05.320> pickaxe<00:04:06.320> also<00:04:06.650> the

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
same as minecraft and pickaxe also the

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:12.360 
same as minecraft and pickaxe also the
same<00:04:06.920> as<00:04:07.040> minecraft<00:04:10.120> simply<00:04:11.120> like<00:04:11.299> that<00:04:11.329> and

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
same as minecraft simply like that and

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.440 
same as minecraft simply like that and
also<00:04:13.370> an<00:04:14.030> axe<00:04:14.390> saves<00:04:15.140> minecraft<00:04:16.030> I'm<00:04:17.030> not<00:04:17.209> sure

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
also an axe saves minecraft I'm not sure

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:24.700 
also an axe saves minecraft I'm not sure
I'm<00:04:17.840> not<00:04:18.049> really<00:04:18.200> aware<00:04:18.560> of<00:04:18.620> any<00:04:19.250> other<00:04:19.459> tools
