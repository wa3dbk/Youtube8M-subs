00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
storage what was the purpose of that he

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.760 
storage what was the purpose of that he
did<00:02:03.540> have<00:02:03.689> lots<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:04.020> wall<00:02:04.200> breakers<00:02:04.500> with<00:02:04.649> him

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
did have lots of wall breakers with him

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.590 
did have lots of wall breakers with him
too<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.130> don't<00:02:05.219> I<00:02:05.579> doubt<00:02:05.909> he<00:02:06.210> used<00:02:06.479> the

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
too so I don't I doubt he used the

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.419 
too so I don't I doubt he used the
earthquake<00:02:06.899> spells<00:02:07.170> on<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.530> walls<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:07.979> highly

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
earthquake spells on the walls I highly

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.490 
earthquake spells on the walls I highly
doubt<00:02:08.550> that<00:02:08.610> but<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.420> guess<00:02:09.690> he<00:02:09.840> could<00:02:10.110> have<00:02:10.140> but

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
doubt that but I guess he could have but

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.619 
doubt that but I guess he could have but
still<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.250> earthquake<00:02:11.970> spells<00:02:12.209> on<00:02:12.480> the
