I'm<00:00:11.700> a<00:00:11.730> little<00:00:12.240> hesitant<00:00:12.389> to<00:00:12.900> pick<00:00:13.290> up<00:00:13.469> rise

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
I'm a little hesitant to pick up rise

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.550 
I'm a little hesitant to pick up rise
I'm<00:00:14.580> waiting<00:00:14.849> for<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.179> review<00:00:15.570> but<00:00:16.230> what

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
I'm waiting for the review but what

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.140 
I'm waiting for the review but what
makes<00:00:16.770> me<00:00:16.980> hesitant<00:00:17.490> is<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.850> fact<00:00:18.060> that

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
makes me hesitant is the fact that

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.720 
makes me hesitant is the fact that
Microsoft<00:00:18.779> was<00:00:19.350> either<00:00:19.500> smart<00:00:19.980> or<00:00:20.160> stupid

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
Microsoft was either smart or stupid

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.320 
Microsoft was either smart or stupid
enough<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:22.230> not<00:00:22.890> lift<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.369> embargo<00:00:23.460> on<00:00:23.880> the

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
enough to not lift the embargo on the

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.470 
enough to not lift the embargo on the
rise<00:00:24.660> reviews<00:00:25.320> until<00:00:26.070> Thursday<00:00:26.670> that's<00:00:27.210> right

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.769

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779

make a quick decision on whether to get
the<00:00:38.430> game<00:00:38.670> in<00:00:38.910> my<00:00:39.360> opinion<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.899> game<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.290> going

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
the game in my opinion the game is going

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.410 
the game in my opinion the game is going
to<00:00:40.469> be<00:00:40.559> horrible<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.190> that's<00:00:41.790> why<00:00:42.059> they're

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
to be horrible and that's why they're

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.720 
to be horrible and that's why they're
doing<00:00:42.450> this<00:00:42.750> but<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.559> could<00:00:44.190> come<00:00:44.430> out<00:00:44.520> and

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
doing this but it could come out and

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.490 
doing this but it could come out and
blow<00:00:45.000> people<00:00:45.360> out<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.660> water<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.170> be<00:00:46.469> a

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
blow people out of the water and be a

think it's a fucking dumbass move by
Microsoft<00:00:51.649> most<00:00:52.649> people<00:00:53.039> have<00:00:53.190> already

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
Microsoft most people have already

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
and it is one of the visually best

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.069
