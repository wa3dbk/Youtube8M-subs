00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
know it's pretty simple so you do is

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.479 
know it's pretty simple so you do is

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
take this and you fling it this way and

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:37.920 
take this and you fling it this way and
then<00:02:36.700> see<00:02:37.030> you<00:02:37.150> have<00:02:37.270> this<00:02:37.420> and<00:02:37.720> you<00:02:37.900> can

know so it says puzzle complete now see

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.710 
know so it says puzzle complete now see
this<00:02:44.380> is<00:02:44.440> an<00:02:44.620> example<00:02:44.980> I'm<00:02:45.430> you<00:02:45.880> can't<00:02:46.150> you

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
this is an example I'm you can't you

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.990 
this is an example I'm you can't you
can't<00:02:46.959> make<00:02:47.140> them<00:02:47.350> hit<00:02:47.590> each<00:02:47.709> other<00:02:47.860> it<00:02:48.760> says

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
can't make them hit each other it says

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.729 
can't make them hit each other it says
you<00:02:49.150> cannot<00:02:49.360> fling<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.870> balls<00:02:50.080> into

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
you cannot fling the balls into

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.120 
you cannot fling the balls into
neighboring<00:02:51.250> furballs<00:02:51.670> lie<00:02:52.330> about<00:02:52.510> that<00:02:53.130> so

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
neighboring furballs lie about that so

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.309 
neighboring furballs lie about that so
