00:00:00.671 --> 00:00:02.898
I asked her

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:06.090
What is your wish?

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.776
I wish you find the book
and become a human

00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:11.702
That's what I wish

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.457
So I want to become a human

00:00:16.457 --> 00:00:20.453
I want to be human again

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:28.031
The one who let me know
my heart is beating

00:00:28.031 --> 00:00:35.485
The one who fills my heart
when I breathe

00:00:35.485 --> 00:00:39.295
I try to push..

00:00:39.295 --> 00:00:43.571
I try to empty..

00:00:43.571 --> 00:00:51.156
But I get to miss you
more and more

00:00:51.156 --> 00:00:58.357
The one who's hurt more
because of bruise, spreading

00:00:58.357 --> 00:01:06.121
The one I can see
when I close my eyes

00:01:06.121 --> 00:01:09.159
I try to hold up..

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:14.044
I try to forget..

00:01:14.044 --> 00:01:21.362
But only you
are in my heart

00:01:21.362 --> 00:01:28.812
The reason I live
is only you

00:01:28.812 --> 00:01:36.024
The reason I breathe
is only you

00:01:36.024 --> 00:01:51.813
I cry my heart out
I call your name

00:01:51.813 --> 00:01:59.834
The one in my heart
is only you

00:01:59.834 --> 00:02:06.958
Taking my heart without noise
You're a bad one

00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:14.730
Giving me love
that is hurt

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.597
I try to hide..

00:02:17.597 --> 00:02:22.652
I try to deny..

00:02:22.652 --> 00:02:29.877
But only you
are in my heart

00:02:29.877 --> 00:02:37.365
The reason I live
is only you

00:02:37.365 --> 00:02:44.639
The reason I breathe
is only you

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:59.944
I cry my heart out
I call your name

00:02:59.944 --> 00:03:04.202
So only you can hear me

00:03:04.202 --> 00:03:07.867
So only you can feel me

00:03:07.867 --> 00:03:11.728
Now I'm calling you

00:03:11.728 --> 00:03:18.669
Now I'm here for you

00:03:27.128 --> 00:03:34.515
You're my last dream
left in this world

00:03:34.515 --> 00:03:41.697
You're my everything
one and only in the world

00:03:41.697 --> 00:03:57.696
I cry my heart out
I call your name

00:03:57.696 --> 00:04:04.961
The one I look at forever
is only you

00:04:04.961 --> 00:04:12.227
The one I love forever
is only you

00:04:12.227 --> 00:04:18.764
Even if my heart
stops beating

00:04:18.764 --> 00:04:27.989
I'll call you
Only you

00:04:27.989 --> 00:04:39.762
You're the only one
in my heart
