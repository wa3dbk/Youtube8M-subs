00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
morning when it came time to do my

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.429 
morning when it came time to do my
weigh-in<00:01:37.399> I<00:01:37.970> realized<00:01:38.509> that<00:01:38.720> no<00:01:39.049> one<00:01:39.259> in<00:01:39.409> my

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
weigh-in I realized that no one in my

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:41.859 
weigh-in I realized that no one in my
family<00:01:40.040> in<00:01:40.220> Florida<00:01:40.640> seems<00:01:41.000> to<00:01:41.240> own<00:01:41.390> a<00:01:41.420> scale

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
family in Florida seems to own a scale

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.310 
family in Florida seems to own a scale
so<00:01:42.860> what<00:01:43.100> I<00:01:43.130> did<00:01:43.280> was<00:01:43.820> drive<00:01:44.240> over<00:01:44.600> to<00:01:44.780> Publix

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
so what I did was drive over to Publix

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.770 
so what I did was drive over to Publix
and<00:01:45.590> use<00:01:45.829> their<00:01:46.130> scale<00:01:46.460> so<00:01:47.000> I'll<00:01:47.240> go<00:01:47.420> ahead<00:01:47.479> and

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
and use their scale so I'll go ahead and

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:54.680 
and use their scale so I'll go ahead and
get<00:01:47.930> to<00:01:48.049> that<00:01:48.079> now

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.080 

213<00:01:55.690> pounds<00:01:55.990> so<00:01:56.800> that's<00:01:56.920> a<00:01:57.070> loss<00:01:57.250> of<00:01:57.490> 1<00:01:57.790> pound

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
213 pounds so that's a loss of 1 pound

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.920 
213 pounds so that's a loss of 1 pound
in<00:01:58.570> the<00:01:58.720> last<00:01:58.930> two<00:01:59.260> weeks<00:01:59.560> and<00:01:59.890> a<00:02:00.640> 33<00:02:01.240> week<00:02:01.690> loss

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
in the last two weeks and a 33 week loss

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.630 
in the last two weeks and a 33 week loss
of<00:02:02.400> 76<00:02:03.400> pounds<00:02:04.020> now<00:02:05.020> I<00:02:05.050> do<00:02:05.230> think<00:02:05.800> that<00:02:05.920> it's

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
of 76 pounds now I do think that it's

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.620 
of 76 pounds now I do think that it's
probably<00:02:06.850> gonna<00:02:07.030> be<00:02:07.210> a<00:02:07.240> little<00:02:07.390> different

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
probably gonna be a little different

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.690 
probably gonna be a little different
when<00:02:07.900> I<00:02:07.930> get<00:02:08.170> home<00:02:08.380> and<00:02:08.560> get<00:02:08.710> back<00:02:08.890> to<00:02:09.130> my<00:02:09.310> scale

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
when I get home and get back to my scale

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.150 
when I get home and get back to my scale
which<00:02:09.910> is<00:02:09.940> my<00:02:10.330> baseline<00:02:10.810> at<00:02:11.620> least<00:02:11.860> it<00:02:12.010> gives

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
which is my baseline at least it gives

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.790 
which is my baseline at least it gives
me<00:02:12.310> a<00:02:12.340> baseline<00:02:13.090> to<00:02:13.330> know<00:02:13.540> that<00:02:13.840> my<00:02:14.080> weight<00:02:14.770> is

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
me a baseline to know that my weight is

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.260 
me a baseline to know that my weight is
going<00:02:15.190> in<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.490> right<00:02:15.610> direction

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270
