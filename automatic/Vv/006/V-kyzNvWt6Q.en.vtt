00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
a pre heated oven at a hundred and

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.800

so I've just taken it out of the oven
and<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.300> best<00:02:36.480> way<00:02:36.599> to<00:02:36.660> check<00:02:36.870> it<00:02:37.020> is<00:02:37.080> if<00:02:37.319> you

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
and the best way to check it is if you

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.260 
and the best way to check it is if you
stick<00:02:37.709> a<00:02:37.800> wooden<00:02:37.950> skewer<00:02:38.280> inside<00:02:38.910> and<00:02:39.209> it

stick a wooden skewer inside and it
comes<00:02:39.450> out<00:02:39.630> clean<00:02:39.900> that<00:02:40.200> means<00:02:40.380> it's<00:02:40.530> ready
