pretty even on each side okay then you

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.649 
pretty even on each side okay then you

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360

through and then you make sure that it's
not<00:01:50.229> twisted<00:01:50.500> again<00:01:51.060> then<00:01:52.060> you<00:01:52.210> take<00:01:52.390> the<00:01:52.570> same

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
not twisted again then you take the same

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.679 
not twisted again then you take the same
shoe<00:01:53.170> lace<00:01:53.350> that<00:01:53.500> you<00:01:53.619> just<00:01:53.860> had<00:01:54.100> and<00:01:54.430> you<00:01:55.420> go

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.910 

okay<00:02:08.430> then<00:02:09.210> you<00:02:09.360> do<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.720> exact<00:02:10.050> same<00:02:10.200> thing<00:02:10.680> on

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
okay then you do the exact same thing on

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.100 
okay then you do the exact same thing on
the<00:02:11.280> opposite<00:02:11.730> side<00:02:12.000> so<00:02:12.270> you<00:02:12.330> take<00:02:12.630> the

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
the opposite side so you take the

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.110 
the opposite side so you take the
shoelace<00:02:13.560> that<00:02:13.860> you<00:02:13.980> haven't<00:02:14.370> worked<00:02:15.000> with

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
shoelace that you haven't worked with

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
shoelace that you haven't worked with
yet<00:02:15.930> then<00:02:16.740> you<00:02:16.890> go<00:02:17.100> to<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:18.000> opposite<00:02:18.540> side<00:02:18.780> on

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
yet then you go to the opposite side on

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.600 
yet then you go to the opposite side on
the<00:02:19.710> third<00:02:20.100> hole<00:02:20.460> so<00:02:21.450> you<00:02:21.480> skip<00:02:21.900> over<00:02:22.610> the

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
the third hole so you skip over the

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.590 
the third hole so you skip over the
second<00:02:23.970> hole<00:02:24.120> again<00:02:25.610> then<00:02:26.610> you<00:02:26.640> go<00:02:26.970> through<00:02:27.000> on

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
second hole again then you go through on

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:34.360 
second hole again then you go through on
top

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.780 

so<00:02:34.940> it<00:02:35.330> should<00:02:35.720> look<00:02:36.140> like<00:02:36.500> that<00:02:37.159> right<00:02:37.370> now<00:02:37.459> so

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
so it should look like that right now so

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.479 
so it should look like that right now so
you<00:02:37.849> have<00:02:37.909> your<00:02:38.450> first<00:02:38.659> X<00:02:41.230> then<00:02:42.230> you<00:02:42.830> take<00:02:43.129> the

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
you have your first X then you take the

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.970 
you have your first X then you take the
same<00:02:44.299> shoe<00:02:44.569> lace<00:02:44.720> that<00:02:44.900> you've<00:02:45.049> just<00:02:45.349> had<00:02:45.620> and

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
same shoe lace that you've just had and

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.420 
same shoe lace that you've just had and
you<00:02:46.670> go<00:02:47.239> through<00:02:47.659> the<00:02:48.560> hole<00:02:48.799> that<00:02:49.010> you<00:02:49.129> missed

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
you go through the hole that you missed

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.039 
you go through the hole that you missed
again<00:02:50.530> so<00:02:51.530> now<00:02:51.680> it<00:02:51.890> looks<00:02:52.010> like<00:02:52.190> this<00:02:52.989> ok<00:02:53.989> so

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
again so now it looks like this ok so

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:55.720 
again so now it looks like this ok so
then<00:02:54.319> you<00:02:54.409> just<00:02:54.620> repeat<00:02:54.739> the<00:02:54.980> steps<00:02:55.370> and<00:02:55.640> you

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
then you just repeat the steps and you

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.880 
then you just repeat the steps and you
take<00:02:55.940> one<00:02:56.180> side<00:02:56.480> of<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:56.690> shoelace<00:02:57.110> and<00:02:57.349> you

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
take one side of the shoelace and you

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.030 
take one side of the shoelace and you
skip<00:02:58.190> over<00:02:58.450> the<00:02:59.450> first<00:02:59.720> hole<00:02:59.989> and<00:03:00.230> go<00:03:00.440> to<00:03:00.500> the

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
skip over the first hole and go to the

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:08.530 
skip over the first hole and go to the
next<00:03:01.250> hole<00:03:01.720> on<00:03:02.720> the<00:03:03.049> other<00:03:03.110> side<00:03:07.120> then<00:03:08.120> you<00:03:08.299> go

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
next hole on the other side then you go

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:35.520 
next hole on the other side then you go
in<00:03:08.959> again

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.010 

okay<00:03:36.370> so<00:03:36.430> now<00:03:36.610> you<00:03:36.670> have<00:03:36.790> two<00:03:37.150> x's<00:03:37.630> and<00:03:37.870> you

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 
okay so now you have two x's and you

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.530 
okay so now you have two x's and you
have<00:03:38.200> one<00:03:38.530> hole<00:03:38.800> left<00:03:38.830> on<00:03:39.280> each<00:03:39.430> side<00:03:39.760> so<00:03:40.390> the

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
have one hole left on each side so the

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.960 
have one hole left on each side so the
end<00:03:40.720> it<00:03:40.959> what<00:03:41.290> I<00:03:41.319> do<00:03:41.500> is<00:03:41.890> I<00:03:41.920> take<00:03:42.250> one<00:03:42.670> side<00:03:42.940> of

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
end it what I do is I take one side of

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.110 
end it what I do is I take one side of
the<00:03:43.180> shoelace<00:03:43.569> and<00:03:43.810> I<00:03:44.680> go<00:03:44.890> through<00:03:45.310> one<00:03:45.880> of<00:03:45.910> the

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
the shoelace and I go through one of the

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.510 
the shoelace and I go through one of the
exes<00:03:46.540> and<00:03:47.520> then<00:03:48.520> I<00:03:48.550> go<00:03:48.850> underneath<00:03:50.160> this<00:03:51.160> time

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
exes and then I go underneath this time

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.880 
exes and then I go underneath this time
to<00:03:52.239> the<00:03:52.360> other<00:03:52.569> side<00:03:52.780> you<00:03:53.350> don't<00:03:53.530> skip<00:03:53.709> over

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
to the other side you don't skip over

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.320 
to the other side you don't skip over
any<00:03:54.160> holes<00:03:54.400> because<00:03:54.760> you<00:03:54.880> don't<00:03:55.060> have<00:03:55.120> any

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
any holes because you don't have any

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.020 
any holes because you don't have any
left<00:03:55.630> and<00:03:56.140> then<00:03:56.770> you<00:03:57.069> make<00:03:57.340> sure<00:03:57.580> that<00:03:57.880> it's

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
left and then you make sure that it's

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.260 
left and then you make sure that it's
not<00:03:58.330> twisted<00:03:58.810> so<00:03:59.800> then<00:04:00.130> you<00:04:00.459> do<00:04:00.640> the<00:04:00.790> opposite

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
not twisted so then you do the opposite

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.250 
not twisted so then you do the opposite
side<00:04:01.540> you<00:04:02.200> go<00:04:02.350> underneath<00:04:02.770> the<00:04:03.130> X<00:04:04.170> see<00:04:05.170> it

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
side you go underneath the X see it

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.350 
side you go underneath the X see it
should<00:04:05.470> look<00:04:05.590> like<00:04:05.650> that<00:04:06.010> and<00:04:07.739> then<00:04:08.739> you<00:04:08.980> go

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
should look like that and then you go

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.320 
should look like that and then you go
underneath<00:04:10.360> and<00:04:10.810> not<00:04:11.019> over<00:04:11.970> into<00:04:12.970> the<00:04:13.090> last

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
underneath and not over into the last

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.370 
underneath and not over into the last
hole<00:04:14.730> so<00:04:15.730> by<00:04:15.910> going<00:04:16.120> underneath<00:04:16.630> the<00:04:17.079> large

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
hole so by going underneath the large

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.170 
hole so by going underneath the large
axe<00:04:17.680> right<00:04:17.919> here<00:04:18.160> it<00:04:18.400> makes<00:04:18.579> it<00:04:18.760> look<00:04:18.940> a<00:04:18.970> lot

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
axe right here it makes it look a lot

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.380 
axe right here it makes it look a lot
