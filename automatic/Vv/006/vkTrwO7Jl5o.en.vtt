00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:08.970
 for idea number one we are going to use 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:11.780
 a cardboard box like this I have 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:17.700
 made with several pieces of cardboard 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:20.400
 and they measure eleven by eleven centimeters 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:23.039
 first of all we will also use 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.730
 Brushes 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.810
 acrylic paintings in lynx 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.810
 and liquid silicone 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:37.980
 we are going to need 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:40.649
 white glue diluted in water 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:45.140
 and also pieces of paper either 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.140
 paper or white paper napkin 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:53.860
 let's use a brush and let's 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.950
 Fill 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.130
 we are going to 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:02.160
 white experiment 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.910
 to later hit our 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.910
 napkin 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.410
 since it's finished for example I have 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.800
 this one that had already finished the painting 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:21.380
 all in white and then paint 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.080
 the edges of pink you can 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.300
 paint everything in another purple black color 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.490
 blue is what you want, I decided 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:33.140
 paint it like that we're going to need it too 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.590
 photograph of 10 centimeters by 10 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.590
 centimeters 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:44.140
 well the paintings obviously the 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.990
 We use to paint the box and silicone 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.170
 liquid 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.759
 we're going to hit them in this way, giving 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.759
 one space for each 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.700
 on this side we are also going to put it and 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.700
 of this star 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.650
 for the first material will be a hair that 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:31.050
 I'm using this and I'm already 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:34.040
 recycling or otherwise also newspaper 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.860
 a piece of blanket 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.370
 We are also going to use molds 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.370
 letters 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:46.510
 let's use scissors 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:50.190
 bottle tops to be able to do 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.190
 paint combinations 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.170
 the truth is that my brush is something 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:58.520
 old man and I will use this that is my 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.810
 We will also use a down 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.040
 or pencil 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.549
 and paintings 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:09.730
 of all the colors that you have me 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:11.330
 I recommend the basics that is red the 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:16.010
 blue 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:18.790
 the yellow the black and the white but 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.790
 only textile paint 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:26.560
 let's accommodate all our letters and 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.560
 with a black down 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:35.110
 let's outline each of our 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:37.659
 letters without leaving any edge without 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.900
 make a line of more has to be 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:44.940
 perfect and so it will be successively 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.940
 With all the letters 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.790
 since we have come to the last 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:13.550
 letter this is how we have our 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:16.060
 signboard or our blanket happy complexes 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.060
 and towers 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:23.200
 later we are going to make a mixture 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.750
 with the vinci or acrylic paintings of 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.180
 the colors that you prefer to the 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.820
 we are going to pour water and what 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.760
 let's mix until you have a mixture 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.560
 uniform you're going to tell when 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.420
 is ready does not have to be very 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:42.930
 watery or very thick 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:45.830
 and so it will be with all the paintings 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.830
 what you wish 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:57.940
 and now if we are ready to paint 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:01.810
 in this case I am using the paint 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:05.010
 red try not to get out of the edges 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.010
 that you have already painted 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.630
 a very important note as it is 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:17.570
 diluted in water each time you go 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:20.930
 washing if you wash the blanket is going to 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:24.340
 go thinning the color so try 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.340
 that is not so much water 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:42.449
 as you see I skipped all many letters 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:45.780
 so he paints other letters of red and so on and 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:49.939
 good as we go finishing also 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:55.199
 let's outline each letter with 

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:57.910
 black paint is textile or acrylic and is 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:06:00.990
 as it is becoming 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:04.150
 and here we leave you this is another option 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:07.570
 that they also did to me and good 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:10.840
 I leave you here what the 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:15.070
 gifts with well the result I hope that
