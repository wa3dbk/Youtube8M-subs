00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.470
 fine i went to mine a little and 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:08.309
 add some useful stuff to us 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.050
 how are these 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.599
 of which we make an instrument excellent 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.849
 it has rained his third of which is Diana 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.160
 tools are we recycle is me 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.100
 I do not know what but if you hover on it and 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.580
 press shift then the light will bullseye 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.920
 I tell you here we have some kind of ingot and 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.099
 stone well and shorter in almost every home 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.669
 there is such a thing in the mine Yaschenko forty 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.579
 three coals barely 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:39.450
 court rather dug out 12 in general, these things 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.620
 just there a bunch of us lying around and so why 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.950
 would i like to start 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.350
 Well, I don’t know anything here, that is 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.000
 I do not even know how it is 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.770
 hard to craft because I don't know 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.079
 what is it that this is so well and perhaps I 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.960
 I think we need and I would also like 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.149
 to talk about such a fashion that stands at the 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.920
 this server adds this mod 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:08.280
 several new biomes are all i 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.810
 saw this autumn forest there just 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.549
 multicolored village 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:20.549
 trees falda so to speak the cathedral is not yet 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:23.520
 no cathedral such densely planted trees 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.979
 in this forest and the trees are so tall 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:31.229
 that I do not know higher than the highest 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:34.610
 the village is a tree in the jungle 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:38.630
 same white but there they are planted more we cut 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.649
 I also saw the dead desert just 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.360
 repainted desert i don't know what 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:46.409
 difference 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:48.810
 so what else did i see saw the forest purely in 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.229
 which there is oak and birch here such here 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.200
 fox there is still pure icy byul then 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.759
 is there just ice from the snow just 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.979
 nothing more play water games 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:03.810
 here is still white pure where is the grass 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.840
 look here we have the land yes this 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.849
 brown is a poop that is in this 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:15.840
 Biomed stupidly all grass such 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:18.840
 and she more she more like to say here 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.880
 a tree from the autumn forest looks more like it 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.490
 i.e 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:29.440
 thick or not dark here 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:32.170
 and all the bands on yak for so but I don't think 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.050
 that you need to start industrial since 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.130
 it's generally very hard you look at 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.220
 Kraft you have a rotar 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:42.520
 well i know maybe i'll get it 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:48.280
 in three months because I am wrong 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:51.160
 here it is now okay it is also so generally 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.260
 I was told that there is a mod 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.470
 which replaces all these moderators all 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.470
 bullshit 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:04.230
 that is, no substitute is crafted just 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.920
 easier so it will be that coaches so 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.290
