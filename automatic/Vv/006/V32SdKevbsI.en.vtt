00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.510 

so<00:00:14.840> on<00:00:14.930> the<00:00:15.020> bottom<00:00:15.260> of<00:00:15.320> the<00:00:15.410> foot<00:00:15.680> are<00:00:15.860> two

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:16.520 
so on the bottom of the foot are two

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.430 
so on the bottom of the foot are two
little<00:00:16.790> floating<00:00:17.180> bones<00:00:17.510> that<00:00:17.840> most<00:00:18.080> people

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:18.440 
little floating bones that most people

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.560 
little floating bones that most people
will<00:00:18.590> never<00:00:18.830> hear<00:00:19.790> about<00:00:20.000> unless<00:00:20.270> they

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
will never hear about unless they

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.740 
will never hear about unless they
develop<00:00:20.960> a<00:00:21.050> problem<00:00:21.290> with<00:00:21.650> them<00:00:22.390> those<00:00:23.390> little

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
develop a problem with them those little

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.570 
develop a problem with them those little
floating<00:00:23.960> loads<00:00:24.260> are<00:00:24.349> known<00:00:24.500> as<00:00:24.619> sesamoid<00:00:25.189> and

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
floating loads are known as sesamoid and

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.570 
floating loads are known as sesamoid and
just<00:00:26.300> like<00:00:26.509> the<00:00:26.750> kneecap<00:00:27.320> the<00:00:27.770> sesamoid<00:00:28.279> ZAR

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
just like the kneecap the sesamoid ZAR

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.540 
just like the kneecap the sesamoid ZAR
free-floating<00:00:29.480> bones<00:00:30.070> they<00:00:31.070> have<00:00:31.310> their<00:00:31.520> own

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
free-floating bones they have their own

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.880 
free-floating bones they have their own
special<00:00:32.090> grooves<00:00:32.570> on<00:00:32.930> the<00:00:33.260> bottom<00:00:33.440> of<00:00:33.739> the

special grooves on the bottom of the
metatarsal<00:00:34.520> head<00:00:34.850> so<00:00:35.239> this<00:00:35.390> is<00:00:35.510> an<00:00:35.629> actual

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
metatarsal head so this is an actual

first metatarsal bone the bottom of it

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.119 
first metatarsal bone the bottom of it
here<00:00:39.370> notice<00:00:40.370> these<00:00:40.730> grooves<00:00:41.210> here<00:00:42.140> that's

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
here notice these grooves here that's

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:44.439 
here notice these grooves here that's
where<00:00:43.340> the<00:00:43.460> sesamoid<00:00:43.879> 's<00:00:43.940> are<00:00:44.090> supposed<00:00:44.360> to

reside and they do for a little while if
your<00:00:48.680> toe<00:00:48.980> is<00:00:49.190> in<00:00:49.460> natural<00:00:50.210> alignment<00:00:50.530> those

your toe is in natural alignment those
says<00:00:51.800> Boyd's<00:00:52.040> will<00:00:52.190> stay<00:00:52.370> in<00:00:52.489> their<00:00:52.640> grooves

says Boyd's will stay in their grooves
and<00:00:53.180> what<00:00:53.570> I<00:00:53.600> mean<00:00:53.809> by<00:00:53.960> natural<00:00:54.020> alignment<00:00:54.829> is

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
and what I mean by natural alignment is

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.170 
and what I mean by natural alignment is
if<00:00:55.250> the<00:00:55.640> big<00:00:56.000> toe<00:00:56.500> stays<00:00:57.500> in<00:00:57.890> direct<00:00:58.399> line<00:00:58.820> with

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
if the big toe stays in direct line with

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.450 
if the big toe stays in direct line with
the<00:00:59.450> metatarsal<00:01:00.350> like<00:01:00.530> it's<00:01:00.739> supposed<00:01:01.070> to

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
the metatarsal like it's supposed to

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.279 
the metatarsal like it's supposed to
those<00:01:02.030> little<00:01:02.390> floating<00:01:02.629> bones<00:01:02.899> will<00:01:03.079> stay

00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:03.289 
those little floating bones will stay

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:06.190 
those little floating bones will stay
directly<00:01:03.530> under<00:01:04.070> however<00:01:04.940> most<00:01:05.300> Footwear<00:01:05.899> at

bones<00:01:10.100> out<00:01:10.340> of<00:01:10.369> alignment<00:01:10.700> and<00:01:11.030> it<00:01:11.750> does<00:01:11.990> that

00:01:12.279 --> 00:01:12.289 
bones out of alignment and it does that

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:15.130 
bones out of alignment and it does that
primarily<00:01:12.979> by<00:01:13.399> one<00:01:13.729> deforming<00:01:14.330> force<00:01:14.630> that's

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
primarily by one deforming force that's

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.770 
primarily by one deforming force that's
known<00:01:15.380> as<00:01:15.410> a<00:01:15.560> tapering<00:01:16.039> toe<00:01:16.369> box<00:01:16.610> in<00:01:17.600> other

ball of the foot outward when you when

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.399 
ball of the foot outward when you when

you wear that kind of footwork for a

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.560 
you wear that kind of footwork for a
long<00:01:24.619> period<00:01:24.979> of<00:01:25.010> time<00:01:25.100> the<00:01:25.850> big<00:01:26.060> toe<00:01:26.270> learns

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
long period of time the big toe learns

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.830 
long period of time the big toe learns
to<00:01:26.869> stay<00:01:27.200> in<00:01:27.500> that<00:01:27.710> configuration<00:01:28.040> and<00:01:28.689> so<00:01:29.689> do

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
to stay in that configuration and so do

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.630 
to stay in that configuration and so do
the<00:01:29.990> floating<00:01:30.259> bones<00:01:30.560> so<00:01:31.130> if<00:01:31.220> we<00:01:31.340> take<00:01:31.460> an

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
the floating bones so if we take an

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.249 
the floating bones so if we take an
x-ray<00:01:31.970> at<00:01:32.060> the<00:01:32.119> top<00:01:32.360> of<00:01:32.540> a<00:01:32.630> person's<00:01:32.990> foot

who's<00:01:33.439> been<00:01:33.619> in<00:01:33.770> that<00:01:33.890> kind<00:01:34.340> of<00:01:34.369> a<00:01:34.460> position

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
who's been in that kind of a position

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.300 
who's been in that kind of a position
for<00:01:35.030> a<00:01:35.090> long<00:01:35.270> time<00:01:35.619> we<00:01:36.619> will<00:01:36.799> see<00:01:37.009> that<00:01:37.189> the

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
for a long time we will see that the

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.460 
for a long time we will see that the
inner<00:01:37.549> floating<00:01:38.180> bone<00:01:38.360> is<00:01:38.540> no<00:01:38.780> longer<00:01:39.080> under
