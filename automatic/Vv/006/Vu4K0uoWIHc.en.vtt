 she greeted everyone here revo has come 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.120
 today for this new video 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.039
 on gta 5 online then today the 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.320
 friends I'm going to show you some heavy 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.150
 very very heavy even since today 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.820
 I will show you how to get 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.280
 rare fashion vehicles and and all 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.739
 others free on gta 5 beyond 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.780
 for that we will first save 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.430
 our most recent backup of the mode 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.770
 story on a usb key 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.749
 so do not ask me why but 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.940
 it's important to do it we go next 

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:45.070
 started by checking that our point of 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.579
 reappearance and of course last 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.620
 position 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.379
 we will then go to the market 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.359
 so xbox or pleases no matter 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:53.920
 and at the moment of loading we will 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:56.140
 disconnect from the online network 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.550
 for my part I unplugged the cable 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.550
 ethernet from my console 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:11.939
 So we come back naturally in 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.549
 story mode and we will now have to 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.110
 load our most recent part 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:16.470
 pre- registered on our key 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.690
 usb 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.159
 basically it's in this backup that 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.970
 is the vehicle that we are going 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.190
 take an online once you have arrived 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.570
 in the previously loaded part we are going 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.080
 to go with the vehicle of our 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.869
 choice 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.490
 so space super sports docker or 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.830
 still the buffalo of full sentences 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.570

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.430
 start of handling let our 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.200
 multiplayer character 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.690
 arrived at destination well we'll 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.270
 simply reconnect to xbox live 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.090
 for live playstation and we will launch 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.590

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.030

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.490

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.000

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.000

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.369

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.010

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.450
