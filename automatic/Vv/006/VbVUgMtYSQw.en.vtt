all right let's do another petal review
this<00:00:07.859> is<00:00:08.130> for<00:00:08.519> an<00:00:08.790> old<00:00:10.460> Ibanez<00:00:12.170> Ibanez<00:00:13.170> flanger

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
this is for an old Ibanez Ibanez flanger

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.580 
this is for an old Ibanez Ibanez flanger
it<00:00:14.009> is<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:15.080> FL<00:00:16.080> 301<00:00:16.650> DX<00:00:17.160> model<00:00:18.140> very<00:00:19.140> old<00:00:19.529> I

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
it is the FL 301 DX model very old I

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.720 
it is the FL 301 DX model very old I
believe<00:00:19.740> it's<00:00:19.949> made<00:00:20.609> in<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.880> 70s<00:00:22.340> and<00:00:23.340> it's

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
believe it's made in the 70s and it's

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.970 
believe it's made in the 70s and it's
kind<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:24.060> subtle<00:00:24.300> flanger<00:00:24.869> effect<00:00:24.900> not<00:00:25.439> and

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
kind of a subtle flanger effect not and

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.339 
kind of a subtle flanger effect not and
overly<00:00:26.760> digitized<00:00:27.269> expected<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:27.990> be<00:00:28.080> able<00:00:28.170> to

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
overly digitized expected to be able to

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.260 
overly digitized expected to be able to
analog<00:00:28.740> pedal<00:00:29.130> but<00:00:29.369> it's<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.330> subtle<00:00:30.779> effect

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
analog pedal but it's a subtle effect

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.639 
analog pedal but it's a subtle effect
almost<00:00:33.270> like<00:00:33.710> like<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.739> phaser<00:00:35.160> but<00:00:36.500> kind<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.530> a

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
almost like like a phaser but kind of a

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.060 
almost like like a phaser but kind of a
cool<00:00:37.860> pedal<00:00:38.510> inside<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.870> case<00:00:40.110> there's<00:00:41.010> a

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
cool pedal inside of the case there's a

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.920 
cool pedal inside of the case there's a
couple<00:00:41.280> trim<00:00:41.670> plots<00:00:41.940> that<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.300> can<00:00:42.450> turn<00:00:42.719> to

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
couple trim plots that you can turn to

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.459 
couple trim plots that you can turn to
change<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.590> flavor<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.399> flanger<00:00:44.850> as<00:00:45.000> well

change the flavor of the flanger as well
which<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.620> kind<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:46.920> cool<00:00:47.690> so<00:00:48.690> I'll

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
which is kind of cool so I'll

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.600 
which is kind of cool so I'll
demonstrate<00:00:48.989> this<00:00:49.500> basically<00:00:49.950> running

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610

I'll<00:01:02.579> kick<00:01:02.940> in<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.210> little<00:01:03.239> bit<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.840> tech21

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
I'll kick in a little bit of the tech21

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.960 
I'll kick in a little bit of the tech21
comp<00:01:05.610> torsion<00:01:06.210> it's<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:07.490> this<00:01:08.490> hair<00:01:08.790> is

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
comp torsion it's a this hair is

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.000 
comp torsion it's a this hair is
actually<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.390> mixture<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.229> distortion<00:01:10.890> as

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
actually a mixture of a distortion as

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.740 
actually a mixture of a distortion as
well<00:01:11.189> as<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.340> compressors<00:01:11.909> actually<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.330> really

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
cool pedal and then a boss OD 3

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.190 
cool pedal and then a boss OD 3
overdrive<00:01:17.280> for<00:01:17.520> some<00:01:17.729> overdrive<00:01:18.630> stuff<00:01:19.020> as

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
overdrive for some overdrive stuff as

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.940 
overdrive for some overdrive stuff as
well<00:01:19.729> but<00:01:20.729> this<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.450> more<00:01:22.020> about<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.470> flanger

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
well but this is more about the flanger

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.320 
well but this is more about the flanger
so<00:01:23.100> I'll<00:01:23.189> play<00:01:23.400> with<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.610> flanger<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.060> little

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
so I'll play with the flanger a little
