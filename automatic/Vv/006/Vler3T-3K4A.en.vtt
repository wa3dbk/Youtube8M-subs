you<00:03:41.500> know<00:03:41.620> where<00:03:41.800> players<00:03:42.070> go<00:03:42.400> on<00:03:42.640> the<00:03:42.880> map

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
you know where players go on the map

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.240 
you know where players go on the map
with<00:03:43.510> that<00:03:43.720> said<00:03:43.989> they<00:03:44.350> do<00:03:44.410> have<00:03:44.709> plans<00:03:44.980> of

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
with that said they do have plans of

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.300 
with that said they do have plans of
adding<00:03:45.850> advanced<00:03:46.810> crafting<00:03:47.410> tables<00:03:47.800> into

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
adding advanced crafting tables into

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.370 
adding advanced crafting tables into
that<00:03:48.700> maintenance<00:03:48.970> structure<00:03:49.930> that<00:03:50.050> you<00:03:50.140> see

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
that maintenance structure that you see

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.170 
that maintenance structure that you see
in<00:03:50.590> the<00:03:50.709> picture<00:03:50.739> which<00:03:51.610> will<00:03:51.790> soon<00:03:52.000> become

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
in the picture which will soon become

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.330 
in the picture which will soon become
interval<00:03:53.050> and<00:03:53.230> that's<00:03:53.680> where<00:03:53.890> you<00:03:53.920> will<00:03:54.220> be

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
interval and that's where you will be

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.670 
interval and that's where you will be
able<00:03:54.370> to<00:03:54.550> go<00:03:54.730> in<00:03:54.970> and<00:03:55.000> do<00:03:55.959> your<00:03:56.110> advanced

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
able to go in and do your advanced

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.590 
able to go in and do your advanced
weapon<00:03:57.040> customization<00:03:57.220> so<00:03:58.030> very<00:03:58.360> interesting

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
weapon customization so very interesting

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.380 
weapon customization so very interesting
concepts<00:03:59.380> here<00:03:59.650> it<00:04:00.610> will<00:04:00.790> be<00:04:00.910> interesting<00:04:00.940> to

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
concepts here it will be interesting to

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.570 
concepts here it will be interesting to
see<00:04:01.510> how<00:04:01.870> this<00:04:02.050> ends<00:04:02.380> up<00:04:02.500> working<00:04:02.769> out<00:04:03.010> in<00:04:03.220> game

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
see how this ends up working out in game

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.150 
see how this ends up working out in game
and<00:04:03.820> what<00:04:04.660> this<00:04:04.780> advanced<00:04:05.260> crafting<00:04:05.860> table

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
and what this advanced crafting table

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.220 
and what this advanced crafting table
even<00:04:06.820> looks<00:04:07.030> like<00:04:07.120> and<00:04:07.540> how<00:04:07.750> will<00:04:07.900> be<00:04:08.019> able<00:04:08.080> to

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
even looks like and how will be able to

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.020 
even looks like and how will be able to
use<00:04:08.350> it<00:04:08.380> so<00:04:08.550> can't<00:04:09.550> wait<00:04:09.640> to<00:04:09.760> get<00:04:09.880> more

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
use it so can't wait to get more

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.130 
use it so can't wait to get more
information<00:04:10.209> on<00:04:10.570> that<00:04:10.750> and<00:04:10.959> definitely

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
information on that and definitely

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.890 
information on that and definitely
looking<00:04:11.530> forward<00:04:11.800> to<00:04:12.120> seeing<00:04:13.120> how<00:04:13.330> this<00:04:13.360> ends

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
looking forward to seeing how this ends

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.370 
looking forward to seeing how this ends
up<00:04:14.019> working<00:04:14.560> out

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.990 

okay<00:04:18.380> and<00:04:18.440> then<00:04:18.560> we<00:04:18.709> got<00:04:18.829> an<00:04:18.949> update<00:04:19.070> on<00:04:19.370> the<00:04:19.459> Z

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
okay and then we got an update on the Z

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.030 
okay and then we got an update on the Z
system<00:04:20.449> which<00:04:20.720> was<00:04:20.930> announced<00:04:21.229> a<00:04:21.530> while<00:04:21.769> back

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
system which was announced a while back

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.310 
system which was announced a while back
but<00:04:22.639> they<00:04:23.060> didn't<00:04:23.360> continue<00:04:23.630> working<00:04:23.930> on<00:04:24.139> it

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
but they didn't continue working on it

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.230 
but they didn't continue working on it
because<00:04:24.919> they<00:04:25.070> have<00:04:25.220> more<00:04:25.460> to<00:04:25.669> take<00:04:25.850> care<00:04:26.120> of

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
because they have more to take care of

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.879 
because they have more to take care of
and<00:04:26.389> other<00:04:26.690> things<00:04:27.020> they<00:04:27.169> wanted<00:04:27.410> to<00:04:27.500> focus<00:04:27.650> on

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:27.889 
and other things they wanted to focus on

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:30.129 
and other things they wanted to focus on
but<00:04:28.160> now<00:04:28.310> they<00:04:28.820> are<00:04:29.000> working<00:04:29.240> on<00:04:29.540> this<00:04:29.750> disease

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
but now they are working on this disease

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.170 
but now they are working on this disease
system<00:04:30.530> once<00:04:30.710> again<00:04:31.010> and<00:04:31.220> they<00:04:31.699> said<00:04:31.940> that<00:04:31.970> the

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
system once again and they said that the

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.270 
system once again and they said that the
influence<00:04:32.630> that<00:04:32.810> disease<00:04:33.500> has<00:04:33.770> on<00:04:33.979> a<00:04:34.010> player

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
influence that disease has on a player

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.730 
influence that disease has on a player
depends<00:04:34.910> on<00:04:35.060> their<00:04:35.240> levels<00:04:35.570> of<00:04:35.780> health<00:04:36.139> blood

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
depends on their levels of health blood

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.879 
depends on their levels of health blood
die<00:04:37.280> and<00:04:37.610> exposure<00:04:38.270> player<00:04:39.229> can<00:04:39.440> become<00:04:39.770> a

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
die and exposure player can become a

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:42.159 
die and exposure player can become a
carrier<00:04:40.340> of<00:04:40.490> the<00:04:40.760> disease<00:04:40.790> or<00:04:41.449> the<00:04:41.840> disease

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169 
carrier of the disease or the disease

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:45.610 
carrier of the disease or the disease
might<00:04:42.530> have<00:04:42.830> a<00:04:43.040> heavy<00:04:43.370> impact<00:04:43.850> on<00:04:44.120> them<00:04:44.479> so<00:04:45.350> all

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
might have a heavy impact on them so all

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.250 
might have a heavy impact on them so all
depends<00:04:46.100> on<00:04:46.280> your<00:04:46.820> health<00:04:47.060> you<00:04:48.050> know<00:04:48.080> if

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
depends on your health you know if

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.560 
depends on your health you know if
you're<00:04:48.410> not<00:04:48.590> too<00:04:48.770> healthy<00:04:48.979> if<00:04:49.699> your<00:04:50.330> diet

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
you're not too healthy if your diet

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.870 
you're not too healthy if your diet
isn't<00:04:50.780> too<00:04:51.050> good<00:04:51.229> I<00:04:51.289> guess<00:04:51.410> then<00:04:51.800> the<00:04:52.490> disease

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
isn't too good I guess then the disease

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.270 
isn't too good I guess then the disease
will<00:04:53.240> have<00:04:53.479> a<00:04:53.720> heavy<00:04:54.139> impact<00:04:54.710> on<00:04:55.010> your

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
will have a heavy impact on your

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.939 
will have a heavy impact on your
character<00:04:55.820> it<00:04:56.240> can<00:04:56.479> be<00:04:56.630> transferred<00:04:57.110> from

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:57.949 
character it can be transferred from

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:00.430 
character it can be transferred from
eating<00:04:58.430> the<00:04:59.000> same<00:04:59.210> food<00:04:59.510> that<00:04:59.539> someone<00:04:59.990> else<00:05:00.169> 8

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
eating the same food that someone else 8

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.550 
eating the same food that someone else 8
so<00:05:00.860> if<00:05:01.610> your<00:05:01.729> friend<00:05:01.970> you<00:05:02.360> know<00:05:02.510> had<00:05:03.110> something

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
so if your friend you know had something

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.010 
so if your friend you know had something
that<00:05:03.770> like<00:05:04.400> you<00:05:04.789> know<00:05:04.820> some<00:05:05.060> of<00:05:05.090> the<00:05:05.240> tuna<00:05:05.600> and

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
that like you know some of the tuna and

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.180 
that like you know some of the tuna and
then<00:05:06.139> you<00:05:06.289> had<00:05:06.470> some<00:05:06.620> of<00:05:06.740> that<00:05:06.889> and<00:05:07.039> they<00:05:07.130> were

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
then you had some of that and they were

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.040 
then you had some of that and they were
ill<00:05:07.460> then<00:05:08.210> that's<00:05:08.419> how<00:05:08.630> it<00:05:08.780> will<00:05:08.900> be

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
ill then that's how it will be

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.469 
ill then that's how it will be
transferred<00:05:09.470> to<00:05:09.680> you<00:05:09.860> but<00:05:10.669> they<00:05:10.789> did<00:05:11.000> say<00:05:11.030> it

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 
transferred to you but they did say it

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:13.960 
transferred to you but they did say it
can<00:05:11.750> be<00:05:11.960> eased<00:05:12.260> by<00:05:12.770> medicinal<00:05:13.460> drugs<00:05:13.729> and

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
can be eased by medicinal drugs and

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.270 
can be eased by medicinal drugs and
after<00:05:14.449> getting<00:05:14.630> rid<00:05:14.930> of<00:05:15.020> the<00:05:15.080> disease<00:05:15.500> you<00:05:16.070> are

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
after getting rid of the disease you are

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.580 
after getting rid of the disease you are
resistant<00:05:16.880> from<00:05:17.090> catching<00:05:17.330> it<00:05:17.660> again<00:05:18.020> for

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
resistant from catching it again for

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.529 
resistant from catching it again for
some<00:05:18.860> time<00:05:19.100> they<00:05:19.280> were<00:05:19.340> too<00:05:19.639> specific<00:05:19.850> on<00:05:20.270> how

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:20.539 
some time they were too specific on how

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:22.900 
some time they were too specific on how
long<00:05:20.840> that<00:05:21.050> period<00:05:21.410> is<00:05:21.620> after<00:05:22.370> you<00:05:22.490> get<00:05:22.669> rid<00:05:22.700> of

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
long that period is after you get rid of

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.580 
long that period is after you get rid of
it<00:05:23.090> you<00:05:23.419> know<00:05:23.510> how<00:05:23.660> long<00:05:23.870> you<00:05:23.990> resisted<00:05:24.470> from

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
it you know how long you resisted from

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.710 
it you know how long you resisted from
catching<00:05:24.800> it<00:05:25.070> but<00:05:25.669> they<00:05:25.849> said<00:05:26.120> you<00:05:26.419> noticed

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
catching it but they said you noticed

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.080 
catching it but they said you noticed
for<00:05:26.810> some<00:05:27.020> time<00:05:27.229> they<00:05:28.220> did<00:05:28.430> also<00:05:28.639> state<00:05:29.060> that

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
for some time they did also state that

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.290 
for some time they did also state that
the<00:05:29.539> system<00:05:29.930> can<00:05:30.500> be<00:05:30.560> expanded<00:05:30.979> for<00:05:31.820> example

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
the system can be expanded for example

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.140 
the system can be expanded for example
the<00:05:32.720> use<00:05:32.750> of<00:05:32.930> gloves<00:05:33.410> niosh<00:05:34.099> masks<00:05:34.610> or<00:05:34.760> other

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
the use of gloves niosh masks or other

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:36.820 
the use of gloves niosh masks or other
wearables<00:05:35.720> which<00:05:36.110> can<00:05:36.380> obstruct

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
wearables which can obstruct

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.070 
wearables which can obstruct
transferring<00:05:37.639> of<00:05:37.789> the<00:05:38.090> diseases<00:05:38.599> by<00:05:38.810> specific

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
transferring of the diseases by specific

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.820 
transferring of the diseases by specific
actions<00:05:39.889> like<00:05:40.520> crafting<00:05:41.300> so<00:05:41.570> they<00:05:42.530> could

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
actions like crafting so they could

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.940 
actions like crafting so they could
expand<00:05:43.250> this<00:05:43.400> whole<00:05:43.669> system<00:05:44.090> into<00:05:44.479> that<00:05:44.660> and

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:44.950 
expand this whole system into that and

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.440 
expand this whole system into that and
you<00:05:45.950> know<00:05:46.099> you<00:05:46.639> might<00:05:46.820> have<00:05:46.970> to<00:05:47.060> wear<00:05:47.180> a<00:05:47.210> mask

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:47.450 
you know you might have to wear a mask

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.170 
you know you might have to wear a mask
or<00:05:47.780> other<00:05:48.349> things<00:05:48.979> to<00:05:49.370> protect<00:05:49.639> you<00:05:49.940> from

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
or other things to protect you from

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.300 
or other things to protect you from
catching<00:05:50.750> those<00:05:51.139> diseases<00:05:51.530> so<00:05:51.950> it<00:05:52.010> was<00:05:52.130> nice

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
catching those diseases so it was nice

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.279 
catching those diseases so it was nice
to<00:05:52.520> get<00:05:52.639> an<00:05:52.729> update<00:05:53.030> on<00:05:53.150> this<00:05:53.360> system<00:05:53.570> and<00:05:53.960> to

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:54.289 
to get an update on this system and to

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:56.020 
to get an update on this system and to
see<00:05:54.470> that<00:05:54.500> work<00:05:54.860> still<00:05:55.280> continues<00:05:55.729> on<00:05:55.910> it

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.030 
see that work still continues on it

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:57.610
