little edge right here let's push it

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.530 
little edge right here let's push it
down<00:04:01.310> and<00:04:02.310> there<00:04:02.640> it<00:04:02.730> is<00:04:02.850> that's<00:04:03.180> all<00:04:03.330> there<00:04:03.480> is

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
the eye I don't have this one math these

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.700 
the eye I don't have this one math these
are<00:04:10.830> small<00:04:11.190> easy<00:04:11.640> to<00:04:11.820> deal<00:04:12.060> with<00:04:12.590> one<00:04:13.590> of<00:04:13.650> my

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:13.710 
are small easy to deal with one of my

are small easy to deal with one of my
other<00:04:13.860> videos<00:04:13.950> I<00:04:14.280> showed<00:04:14.490> you<00:04:14.820> how<00:04:14.970> to<00:04:15.000> do

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
other videos I showed you how to do

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.710 
other videos I showed you how to do
these<00:04:15.510> we're<00:04:16.500> just<00:04:16.650> going<00:04:16.830> to<00:04:16.890> do<00:04:17.040> this<00:04:17.190> one<00:04:17.459> a

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
these we're just going to do this one a

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.360 
these we're just going to do this one a
modified<00:04:18.720> hinge<00:04:18.989> method<00:04:19.500> where<00:04:19.920> we'll<00:04:20.130> pull

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
modified hinge method where we'll pull

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.520 
modified hinge method where we'll pull
the<00:04:20.400> graphic<00:04:20.850> halfway<00:04:21.710> bend<00:04:22.710> it<00:04:22.890> back<00:04:24.530> notice

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
the graphic halfway bend it back notice

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.400 
the graphic halfway bend it back notice
that<00:04:25.770> the<00:04:26.670> pointy<00:04:27.300> end<00:04:27.330> of<00:04:27.780> the<00:04:27.900> eye<00:04:27.930> goes

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
that the pointy end of the eye goes

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:29.990 
that the pointy end of the eye goes
forward<00:04:29.010> I've<00:04:29.220> seen<00:04:29.340> a<00:04:29.400> couple<00:04:29.490> people

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
forward I've seen a couple people

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
install them backwards with the rounded

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.810 
install them backwards with the rounded
end<00:04:34.020> going<00:04:34.380> that<00:04:34.530> way<00:04:34.740> not<00:04:35.400> what<00:04:35.550> you<00:04:35.640> want<00:04:35.790> to

end going that way not what you want to

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.840 
end going that way not what you want to
do<00:04:35.940> emit<00:04:36.690> people's<00:04:37.530> looking<00:04:37.830> forward<00:04:38.220> when

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850
