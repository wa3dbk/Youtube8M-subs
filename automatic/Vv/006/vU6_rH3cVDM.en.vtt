00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.040 

so<00:00:29.230> first<00:00:29.560> up<00:00:29.859> is<00:00:30.039> typing<00:00:31.000> with<00:00:31.269> the<00:00:31.449> new<00:00:31.660> gyro

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
so first up is typing with the new gyro

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.430 
so first up is typing with the new gyro
sensor<00:00:32.710> built<00:00:33.010> into<00:00:33.190> the<00:00:33.760> DualShock<00:00:34.390> 4<00:00:34.720> this

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
sensor built into the DualShock 4 this

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.040 
sensor built into the DualShock 4 this
is<00:00:35.710> so<00:00:36.010> efficient<00:00:36.730> and<00:00:36.850> it's<00:00:37.059> so<00:00:37.239> fun<00:00:37.629> to<00:00:37.660> type

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
is so efficient and it's so fun to type

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.229 
is so efficient and it's so fun to type
I<00:00:38.379> find<00:00:38.769> it<00:00:38.920> so<00:00:39.100> much<00:00:39.250> better<00:00:39.519> than<00:00:39.760> just<00:00:40.000> using

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
I find it so much better than just using

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.180 
I find it so much better than just using
the<00:00:40.480> d-pad<00:00:40.989> and<00:00:41.019> going<00:00:41.470> from<00:00:41.590> one<00:00:41.890> character

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
the d-pad and going from one character

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.640 
the d-pad and going from one character
to<00:00:42.489> the<00:00:42.760> other<00:00:42.970> I<00:00:43.239> find<00:00:43.540> that<00:00:43.629> a<00:00:43.750> bit<00:00:43.840> long<00:00:44.409> but

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:44.650 
to the other I find that a bit long but

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.130 
to the other I find that a bit long but
this<00:00:45.129> gyroscope<00:00:45.940> on<00:00:46.150> the<00:00:46.269> DualShock<00:00:46.510> 4<00:00:46.930> it's

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
this gyroscope on the DualShock 4 it's

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.740 
this gyroscope on the DualShock 4 it's
really<00:00:47.530> easy<00:00:47.829> really<00:00:48.519> fast<00:00:49.000> and<00:00:49.210> I<00:00:49.329> love<00:00:49.600> it

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
really easy really fast and I love it

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.990 
really easy really fast and I love it
it's<00:00:49.930> very<00:00:50.170> interactive<00:00:50.620> and<00:00:51.190> the<00:00:51.610> best<00:00:51.820> is

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
it's very interactive and the best is

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.660 
it's very interactive and the best is
since<00:00:52.540> is<00:00:52.690> built<00:00:53.110> into<00:00:53.379> the<00:00:53.589> controller<00:00:54.040> you

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
since is built into the controller you

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.910 
since is built into the controller you
don't<00:00:54.970> even<00:00:55.180> need<00:00:55.629> the<00:00:56.140> PlayStation<00:00:56.800> Eye

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
don't even need the PlayStation Eye

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.979 
don't even need the PlayStation Eye
camera<00:00:57.280> to<00:00:57.790> track<00:00:58.030> the<00:00:58.329> movement<00:00:58.839> of<00:00:58.930> the

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
camera to track the movement of the

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.139 
camera to track the movement of the
controller<00:00:59.530> this<00:01:00.190> is<00:01:00.460> really<00:01:00.670> a<00:01:00.820> nice<00:01:01.090> thing

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
controller this is really a nice thing

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.990 
controller this is really a nice thing
to<00:01:01.629> have<00:01:01.809> and<00:01:02.050> I<00:01:02.410> suspend<00:01:02.949> mode<00:01:03.219> is<00:01:03.430> a<00:01:03.460> really

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
to have and I suspend mode is a really

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.120 
to have and I suspend mode is a really
nice<00:01:04.149> feature<00:01:04.210> on<00:01:04.930> the<00:01:05.080> PlayStation<00:01:05.830> 4

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
nice feature on the PlayStation 4

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.100 
nice feature on the PlayStation 4
essentially<00:01:06.880> what<00:01:07.030> this<00:01:07.179> is<00:01:07.420> is<00:01:07.660> that<00:01:07.840> you<00:01:07.960> can

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
essentially what this is is that you can

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.410 
essentially what this is is that you can
put<00:01:08.289> a<00:01:08.320> PlayStation<00:01:09.100> 4<00:01:09.369> on<00:01:09.520> a<00:01:09.550> power<00:01:09.850> saving

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420

put a PlayStation 4 on a power saving
mode<00:01:10.450> conserving<00:01:11.289> energy<00:01:11.440> but<00:01:12.220> at<00:01:12.369> that<00:01:12.399> same

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
mode conserving energy but at that same

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.999 
mode conserving energy but at that same
time<00:01:12.880> giving<00:01:13.570> a<00:01:13.810> quick<00:01:14.110> boot<00:01:14.500> when<00:01:14.710> you<00:01:14.830> want

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
to play when in power saving mode it can

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.499 
to play when in power saving mode it can
always<00:01:17.679> be<00:01:17.830> connected<00:01:18.130> to<00:01:18.640> the<00:01:18.759> internet<00:01:19.300> so

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
always be connected to the internet so

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:21.990
