00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.690
 Good morning, I returned to the stand of lg 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.559
 and in my hands I have the spirit 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.380
 main characteristics of this 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:17.950
 terminal is a four processor 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.510
 1.3 gigahertz cores screen hd 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.360
 47 inches 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.730
 We have android 5.0 lollipop camera 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.980
 rear of 8 or 5 megapixels depending 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.770
 of the destination country front camera of a 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.680
 mega pixel we will also have a battery 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:35.800
 of 2100 milliamps a gb of ram and 8 gb 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:39.680
 of total internal memory of course not 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:43.430
 bluetooth and wifi connectivity will be missing 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.380
 in the lower margin we will have the 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.970
 Android buttons that are integrated 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.010
 in the user interface and we'll see it 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.949
 a little bit later 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.350
 in the upper margin we have the 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.210
 headset and we also have the camera 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.210
 frontal and of course the sensors 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.800
 if we see the ice cream device in the 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.290
 left side we do not have any kind of 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.260
 button or opening on the bottom side 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.850
 here we have a main microphone and the 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.310
 microusb port to load the 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.610
 device and to access good for 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.520
 use the cable to connect it to 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.910
 computer and transfer files from the 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.100
 memory from the terminal to the pc on the side 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:29.790
 top the jack three and a half to 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.670
 headphones and a secondary microphone 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.700
 if we turn this lg spirit 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.660
 we will have in the lower corner 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.510
 left the device's speaker in 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:45.870
 this format with four small 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:48.390
 holes and a little above it 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:51.120
 that will not be missing because they are both 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.580
 buttons to adjust the volume of the 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.100
 sound and a central button to be able 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.950
 block and unlock the terminal and by 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.920
 course the back camera and the flash of 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.590
 type led the back area which is a 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.690
 Removable cover is plastic but 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.140
 it's not a smooth plastic but it counts 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:12.180
 with some design in principle will be more 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.400
 difficult to scratch than any other 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.360
 Smooth surface and on the front face 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:21.450
 it looks like we will find some glass 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.790
 it looks like it could be crystal 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.160
 we unlocked the device to 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.430
 access the main screen to the 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.069
 interface where you can observe the three 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.959
 buttons to go back to 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.200
 access the home screen and to 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.180
 access the multitasking menu in this 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.690
 main screen we can organize 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.670
 the elements as we want in folders 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.549
 change them of site and of course 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.250
 we can add new widgets or accesses 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:52.680
 direct to applications or change the 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.840
 wallpaper if we slide our finger 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.060
 from the top margin or down 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.489
 we access the drop-down notifications 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.650
 to be able to read the new messages or 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:05.940
 incoming alerts and of course 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:08.400
 we can adjust or activate the bluetooth 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.680
 the location service to activate a 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.170
 nfc wireless access point the 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.080
 device has nfc and others 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.050
 available settings 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:21.350
 the system settings as you can 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:24.190
 observe then typical are typical of 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:28.550
 lg in four desks general 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:31.790
 screen sound and networks that changes it is 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:35.340
 what we saw in g3 that in g3 and 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:38.099
 other lg terminals 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.480
 the camera interface in this lg spirit 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:41.640
 is what you see at this moment 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.250
 we will have a few adjustments 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.110
 available we can change the 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.879
 resolution of camera output 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.650
 back this time we have a 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:51.870
 device with rear camera 8 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.450
 megapixels and we can change the 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:58.049
 video resolution a maximum was an hd 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:01.080
 and a minimum to hd we can activate by 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.670
 Of course the possibility of capture 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:07.380
 through voice commands or a 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:09.840
 timer of 3 or 10 seconds and from 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.410
 here we can activate the option of 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.020
 capture in a single gesture 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:20.500
 as simple as clicking on the 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:20.500
 central screen focus and capture 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.770
 let's see something else then the 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.169
 I really do not know if it's worth it 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:32.380
 take a look at other sections 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:34.990
 because ultimately the applications and 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.300
 the interface of this terminal are the ones 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:40.720
 you could see in the 3s axis that is 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:43.930
 analyzed in this youtube channel 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.830
 lg spirit a new smartphone presented 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.950
 in the mobile world congress of barcelona 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.410
 that stands out for its hd screen of 4.7 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:53.470
 inches for its four processor 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:56.560
 nuclei to 1.3 gigahertz and I what 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:05:00.090
 would do is also highlight your battery of 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.090
 2100 milliamps
