a<00:00:36.930> project<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.590> will<00:00:38.010> address<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.969> lack<00:00:39.719> of

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
a project that will address the lack of

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.930 
a project that will address the lack of
safety<00:00:40.500> standards<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.579> current

safety standards that the current
structure<00:00:42.300> has<00:00:42.480> yeah<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.110> say<00:00:43.320> on<00:00:43.379> any<00:00:43.530> project

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
structure has yeah I say on any project

structure has yeah I say on any project
as<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.040> whole<00:00:44.190> is<00:00:44.460> very<00:00:44.520> important<00:00:45.090> not<00:00:45.329> just

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
as a whole is very important not just

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.569

elementary school I think our community

elementary school I think our community
is<00:01:15.060> going<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.479> look<00:01:15.630> even<00:01:15.810> better<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:17.360> safer

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
is going to look even better and safer

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.080 
is going to look even better and safer

alternative improves traffic problems is

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.460 
alternative improves traffic problems is
through<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.180> expansion<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.110> roadway

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
through the expansion of the roadway

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.499 
through the expansion of the roadway
itself<00:01:25.670> we're<00:01:26.670> adding<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.090> couple<00:01:27.299> of<00:01:27.450> more

itself we're adding a couple of more

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.140 
itself we're adding a couple of more
lanes<00:01:27.930> in<00:01:28.170> each<00:01:28.259> direction<00:01:28.430> those<00:01:29.430> lanes<00:01:29.820> will

lanes in each direction those lanes will

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.350 
lanes in each direction those lanes will
be<00:01:30.200> managed<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.650> they<00:01:31.920> can<00:01:32.189> be<00:01:32.460> congestion

of the central part of the Platte Valley

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.999 
of the central part of the Platte Valley
easily<00:01:45.570> that's<00:01:46.079> coming<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.500> long<00:01:46.680> way<00:01:46.740> from

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
easily that's coming a long way from

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.219 
easily that's coming a long way from
where<00:01:47.399> we<00:01:47.430> were<00:01:47.729> before<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.659> when<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:48.960> throw

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
where we were before and when you throw

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.850 
where we were before and when you throw
in<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.530> ability<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.070> have<00:01:50.399> almost<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:51.000> parkland

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
in the ability to have almost a parkland

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.840 
in the ability to have almost a parkland
experience<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:53.040> think<00:01:53.130> there's<00:01:53.579> going<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.790> be

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
experience I think there's going to be

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.330 
experience I think there's going to be
an<00:01:54.000> aesthetic<00:01:54.450> benefit<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.140> all<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.439> us<00:01:55.590> this

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
an aesthetic benefit to all of us this

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.209 
an aesthetic benefit to all of us this
corridor<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:57.119> attracted<00:01:57.840> over<00:01:58.079> 700<00:01:58.829> current
