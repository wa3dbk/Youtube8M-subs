 I wanted to do this I had 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.210

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.010

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.060
 this is called here born sure that 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.330
 many of you know this 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.519
 man who guesses anything and this 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.590
 series is going to try to try not to 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.310
 guess the pokemon I'm thinking 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.439
 ballistic 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.000
 let's all think of a pokémon and 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.760
 We will answer your questions now 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.950
 see if you always do not know like pokemon 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.610
 we will make chapters if you like the 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.930
 series 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.520
 we will make chapters and more chapters 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.559
 we will make a first chapter second 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.989
 chapter three fourth you can put in 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.750
 the comments that pokemon I can think 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.370
 for the Match and the little things 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.780
 guys I think it's a pretty idea 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.879
 cool a super weird idea and super I do not know 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.129
 is that it is very is it is very rare and 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.690
 I think it will be pretty cool already 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.640
 see that every time if you like come, come on 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:10.390
 to put our nickname that is x 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:11.260
 0 xx 0 x age 19 I am 19 years old 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.210
 who does not know 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.850
 damn a man and let's play me 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.619
 ok guys let's see what it is that 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.630
 this man can ask us 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.430
 and let's think about a first pokemon 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.810
 I hope you like this series like me 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.200
 is going to like me because to me this 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.150
 It seems totally absurd to see 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.310
 what can we think let's start 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.080
 with magic are come with something easy and I 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.909
 then we're going to go complicating the 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.310
 things let's say pokemon these weird 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.770
 there we are going to start with magical come to 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.560
 see if he guesses this man his 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.470
 real character we will not make a couple of 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.300
 characters by video your character is a 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.080
 television series character sweet 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.080
 magic orsi 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.850
 his character is a not a pokémon not 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.640
 it's an animal your character fights full 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.640
 with magic or the righteous 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:09.270
 I do not know the truth, I do not think 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:15.630
 it's his character and if he had not medicated 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:18.300
 what the fuck, uncle, look awesome 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.270
 watch the damn question you just 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.489
 make your character live in the water but 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.440
 If I have not told you anything like pussy 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:29.400
 you can ask me something like that or 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.380
 this normal yellow or greater is 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.000
 orange no 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:39.930
 yellow error pink 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.950
 pink orange we're probably going to put 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:47.340
 your character has hair does not have hair 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.890
 his character is not a star he has 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.010
 arms is here 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.920
 has a carapace shell if one does not 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.510
 It has thorns, not scales, that shell 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:03.079
 no no that beat the shell 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.819
 what the fuck, uncle, I can not believe it 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:08.400
 you have seen seriously this this is 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.079
 too this series this series is going to 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.400
 have bad is going to give a lot to talk about this 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:13.500
 series of guys is going to give a lot that 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.439
 speak this uncle has already guessed right she has 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.030
 accepted if it is a pokémon you will see that 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:19.760
 the certain his character is famous for his 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.069
 clumsiness 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.319
 magical is very clumsy the truth is yes 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:28.780
 but I do not know that I'm probably going to 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:31.750
 put is blue not 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.380
 and I was thinking about the barrel, the fuck is great 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.380
 height not 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:41.640
 live in the sea yes 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:44.709
 It is red that said gave by ass 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:47.349
 I do not know water put I do not know why not 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.540
 I know it 's on two legs not paying 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:51.890
 friend is getting complicated is white 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.300
 skin not 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.090
 your staff that is related to 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:04:00.690
 some no fish no 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:04.340
 probably I say is very not that 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:07.230
 wrong is wrong has both feet not 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.940
 to what is wrong can produce 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.010
 electricity less yet in another pre 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.410
 design and you your character is related 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.769
 particularly with the color red not what 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:20.930
 I know that red or orange is that I do not know 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:20.930
 I think about the mother who was giving birth 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:27.510
 the mother who is going to give birth 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.910
 successful how is it possible to hit 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:33.680
 this turkey 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.680
 I think of magic ar pokemon 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.090
 as with and accepted this this guy 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:43.169
 a certain new I love playing with you 

00:04:40.269 --> 00:04:46.650
 but it will be Jewish for ass 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:48.180
 as nose is successful this we are going to 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.789
 back to play guys let's try 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.259
 again come question number one now 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:56.990
 let's think about what we can in that 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:56.990
 pokemon we can think to see a curious 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.639
 We can think 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:07.749
 some of the pokemon of sapphire pokemon 

00:05:05.209 --> 00:05:10.069
 randomly come on let's think about 

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:11.959
 our first pokemon the first pokemon 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:14.389
 that we had to think in March come 

00:05:11.959 --> 00:05:18.349
 macho let's see if you can accept it 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:20.209
 ready your character is a woman we are not going 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:22.909
 to see I do not know because it's both genres 

00:05:20.209 --> 00:05:26.790
 they are pokemon already starts and starts from 

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:30.480
 small stature so yellow not 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:32.180
 with the sea, your character is not 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.910
 two legs yes 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:38.060
 throwing fire can not throw fire is not 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:43.220
 pink is not pink for your ass either 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:46.580
 green not blue blue is gray is gray not 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:48.620
 blue is not gray is purple is here is 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:53.539
 is putting the red face good either 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:56.980
 more go is white I do not know why it is gray 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:59.590
 or white has male nicola tail 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:01.270
 no male does not have a tail that was 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.590
 thinking, I, my mother, coach 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.140
 because you do not have anything like that if they have 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:10.660
 neck son is a little present there not 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:14.100
 they will use clothes does not have claws 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.100
 he has hands 

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:19.789
 no it's not that it's not white it's gray son 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.720
 He usually practices martial arts and 

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:28.670
 macho is a bit my house that belongs to 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:32.390
 the series of no children a pokémon I'm you 

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:35.690
 saying is brown not 

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:37.370
 is very muscular yes they appear 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:39.290
 victims 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.510
 that says 'the walking dead' if we're 

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:44.660
 talking about pokemon this wizard would rant 

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:46.220
 this wizard of various weight his character 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:50.270
 You can bend iron bars with your 

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:53.320
 sure that if a male leaves and 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.320
 came out ko 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:02.600
 well that is to say it has been wrong in certain 

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:06.040
 way because march if it is but it is male 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:09.080
 its evolution does not know its pre-volution 

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:11.300
 but I was not going mother 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.159
 we will give it for nothing because good 

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:15.490
 if you can confuse in that because 

00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:15.490
 Clear 

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:25.560
 my mother, you are fine filipino 

00:07:24.509 --> 00:07:27.659
 I think that guys who have 

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:29.729
 successful because good things also 

00:07:27.659 --> 00:07:32.729
 that I answer are not 100% certain 

00:07:29.729 --> 00:07:34.560
 because in some things it can be 

00:07:32.729 --> 00:07:36.690
 and I however give it to you that I do not know or 

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:39.449
 that probably therefore I believe 

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:40.800
 that march also successful so 

00:07:39.449 --> 00:07:42.240
 Well, guys, we're going to leave it for 

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.220
 here this episode is going to be like this 8 

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:46.379
 minutes I hope you like this new 

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:49.139
 series if so you want me to do more 

00:07:46.379 --> 00:07:51.060
 chapters of guessing pokémons to see 

00:07:49.139 --> 00:07:53.129
 if we get this guy because he's 

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:55.169
 which is almost impossible that does not warn 

00:07:53.129 --> 00:07:56.039
 see if we get that he does not notice a 

00:07:55.169 --> 00:07:57.389
 Pokemon 

00:07:56.039 --> 00:07:59.610
 If so, and if you like this series, 

00:07:57.389 --> 00:08:01.289
 I would like you to give it a like and if you 

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:03.659
