went back to the future on it it uh it

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.310 
went back to the future on it it uh it
probably<00:04:25.760> was<00:04:25.850> a<00:04:25.880> lot<00:04:26.030> better<00:04:26.240> but<00:04:26.660> in<00:04:26.930> this<00:04:27.050> in

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
probably was a lot better but in this in

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.200 
probably was a lot better but in this in
this<00:04:27.440> instance<00:04:27.920> it<00:04:28.370> didn't<00:04:28.760> hold<00:04:29.000> its

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
this instance it didn't hold its

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.510 
this instance it didn't hold its
consistency<00:04:29.840> yet<00:04:30.020> I<00:04:30.260> bet<00:04:30.470> yeah

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
consistency yet I bet yeah

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.400 
consistency yet I bet yeah
but<00:04:31.790> I'll<00:04:31.850> give<00:04:31.970> it<00:04:32.000> a<00:04:32.060> solid<00:04:32.210> to<00:04:32.450> Deborah<00:04:33.230> last
