00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
to my turret instead of in a straight

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.150 
to my turret instead of in a straight
line<00:01:05.020> so<00:01:05.320> that<00:01:05.350> he<00:01:05.530> ends<00:01:05.710> up<00:01:05.770> taking<00:01:05.830> more

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.160

turret hits he then ignites me which

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:10.410 
turret hits he then ignites me which
almost<00:01:08.979> ruin<00:01:09.190> my<00:01:09.340> healing<00:01:09.729> from<00:01:09.910> saving<00:01:10.300> me

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
almost ruin my healing from saving me

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.300 
almost ruin my healing from saving me
but<00:01:10.899> I<00:01:10.930> was<00:01:11.140> able<00:01:11.259> to<00:01:11.410> hit<00:01:11.680> him<00:01:11.800> and<00:01:11.950> the<00:01:12.130> crates

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
but I was able to hit him and the crates

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.920 
but I was able to hit him and the crates
behind<00:01:12.640> him<00:01:12.759> with<00:01:13.090> all<00:01:13.300> four<00:01:13.570> of<00:01:13.600> my<00:01:13.690> old

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
behind him with all four of my old

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.160 
behind him with all four of my old
charges<00:01:14.350> I<00:01:14.670> think<00:01:15.670> to<00:01:16.030> note<00:01:16.240> here<00:01:16.630> is<00:01:16.780> that<00:01:16.840> he

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
charges I think to note here is that he

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.410 
charges I think to note here is that he
uses<00:01:17.470> all<00:01:17.710> pretty<00:01:18.039> late<00:01:18.310> in<00:01:18.490> his<00:01:18.670> rotation<00:01:19.270> and

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
uses all pretty late in his rotation and

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.330 
uses all pretty late in his rotation and
because<00:01:19.899> it<00:01:20.020> deals<00:01:20.140> extra<00:01:20.500> damage<00:01:20.619> based<00:01:21.100> off

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
because it deals extra damage based off

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.190 
because it deals extra damage based off
of<00:01:21.369> percentage<00:01:22.000> current<00:01:22.330> health<00:01:22.450> he<00:01:22.869> lost<00:01:23.080> a

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
of percentage current health he lost a

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.510 
of percentage current health he lost a
bit<00:01:23.320> of<00:01:23.440> damage<00:01:23.590> there<00:01:23.920> which<00:01:24.190> would<00:01:24.399> have

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
bit of damage there which would have

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.490 
bit of damage there which would have
made<00:01:24.640> a<00:01:24.670> significant<00:01:25.300> difference<00:01:25.390> he<00:01:26.170> fits<00:01:26.380> an

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
made a significant difference he fits an

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.469 
made a significant difference he fits an
auto<00:01:26.740> at<00:01:26.920> the<00:01:27.070> end<00:01:27.190> and<00:01:27.430> walks<00:01:27.759> away<00:01:27.970> thinking

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
auto at the end and walks away thinking

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.590 
auto at the end and walks away thinking
he<00:01:28.569> secured<00:01:28.869> the<00:01:28.959> kill<00:01:29.140> and<00:01:29.610> he<00:01:30.610> would've<00:01:31.000> but

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
he secured the kill and he would've but

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.480 
he secured the kill and he would've but

before<00:01:35.740> he<00:01:35.800> can<00:01:35.920> finish<00:01:36.069> me<00:01:36.340> off

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
before he can finish me off

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.760 
before he can finish me off
I<00:01:36.670> also<00:01:37.149> pop<00:01:37.450> another<00:01:37.720> potion<00:01:38.229> as<00:01:38.380> the<00:01:38.590> last
