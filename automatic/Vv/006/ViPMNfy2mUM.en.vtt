00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 christmas now gull camping tour in saint-martin-en-campagne 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.800
 she opposes the association of residents to the direction of the camping won 154 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.890
 owners of mobile homes ask the authorities to reduce the number of 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.600
 tarpaulins of the 4 halde campsite a request that even earned the president 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.390
 of the association the premature end of her husband marc marandon thursday that airbus 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:23.869
 it's really not a time to move but jean-jacques thomas did not 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:24.660
 no choice 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.970
 he must move his mobile home his terrace and all amenities 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.520
 it was two and a half years ago that was installed at the gull campsite 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.520
 I am asked to be evicted from the campsite 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.440
 the president of an association 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.440
 we created to try to enforce our rights 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.180
 but unfortunately for 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.830
 we do not want to renew my contract 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.190
 at the root of the dispute between the residents' association 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.420
 at the direction of the campsite a visit to the suppression of fraud on demand 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.670
 campers 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.100
 he believes that gulls do not deserve their four stars 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.890
 garnett serviced 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.050
 the bathroom door 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.980
 it works very badly since 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.250
 Since six months 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.700
 it was not 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.240
 to fix 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.840
 lighting in the 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.840
 in disabled toilets 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.830
 so this plan does not do any more maintenance 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.320
 we saw him all behind 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.460
 this Saturday is a camping room 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.930
 so three to four times the barÃ§a did not last 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.979
 nor the courageous natura management who manages the campsite 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.420
 nor the town hall of saint-martin-en-campagne 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.520
 yesterday terrain does not want to express itself until the crackdown on fraud has 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.240
 not decided on the case but in early summer the city would have asked 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.930
 some developments still not realized 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.590
 but for frankness this summer 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.950
 who planted their 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.240
 from then on for right next thinking heads about jean-jacques 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.520
 thomas must leave the premises before October 23 he regrets to leave his 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.620
 gull friends 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.990
 but he intends to stay at the head of the residents' association 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.030
 good evening the wind and the rain is calm tonight little respite for tomorrow monday 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.180
 a quieter and less windy time indeed tomorrow before the arrival of 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.569
