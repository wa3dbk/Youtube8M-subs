00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.930 
tempo time signature and a link to the
loop<00:02:49.380> so<00:02:50.040> even<00:02:50.220> if<00:02:50.310> you<00:02:50.370> don't<00:02:50.459> have<00:02:50.640> a<00:02:50.670> band

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
loop so even if you don't have a band

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.220 
loop so even if you don't have a band
you<00:02:51.150> can<00:02:51.239> still<00:02:51.420> have<00:02:51.540> an<00:02:51.600> accompaniment<00:02:52.019> to

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
you can still have an accompaniment to

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.289 
you can still have an accompaniment to
your<00:02:52.290> jam<00:02:52.650> you<00:02:53.640> had<00:02:53.730> a<00:02:53.760> chance<00:02:53.940> to<00:02:54.060> play<00:02:54.150> around

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
your jam you had a chance to play around

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.740 
your jam you had a chance to play around
with<00:02:54.390> this<00:02:54.510> brain<00:02:54.750> a<00:02:54.780> little<00:02:54.959> bit<00:02:55.430> but<00:02:56.750> you

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
with this brain a little bit but you

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.120 
with this brain a little bit but you
only<00:02:57.900> really<00:02:58.109> scratch<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.560> surface

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
only really scratch the surface

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.800 
only really scratch the surface
tell<00:02:59.280> me<00:02:59.400> how<00:02:59.519> important<00:02:59.970> it<00:03:00.030> is<00:03:00.120> to<00:03:00.180> have<00:03:00.450> it

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
tell me how important it is to have it

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.160 
tell me how important it is to have it
just<00:03:01.019> a<00:03:01.109> massive<00:03:01.790> array<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:03.120> control<00:03:03.510> over<00:03:03.870> a

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
just a massive array and control over a

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.870 
just a massive array and control over a
module<00:03:04.829> like<00:03:04.980> this<00:03:05.010> with<00:03:05.250> an<00:03:05.340> electron<00:03:05.640> drum

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
module like this with an electron drum

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.330 
module like this with an electron drum
kit<00:03:06.090> yeah<00:03:06.480> I<00:03:06.810> think<00:03:07.170> it's<00:03:07.890> just<00:03:08.160> about

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
kit yeah I think it's just about

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.849 
kit yeah I think it's just about
never-ending<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.150> creativity<00:03:10.049> you<00:03:10.410> could

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
never-ending the creativity you could

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:16.690 
never-ending the creativity you could
have<00:03:11.070> with<00:03:11.220> this<00:03:13.549> reverbs<00:03:14.549> and<00:03:14.940> pitches<00:03:15.750> and

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
have with this reverbs and pitches and

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.220 
have with this reverbs and pitches and
delays<00:03:17.700> and<00:03:17.730> all<00:03:18.269> the<00:03:18.420> different<00:03:18.660> sounds<00:03:19.049> so

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
delays and all the different sounds so

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.009 
delays and all the different sounds so
as<00:03:19.680> a<00:03:19.709> learning<00:03:20.070> tool<00:03:20.359> how<00:03:21.359> important<00:03:21.900> is<00:03:21.989> it

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
as a learning tool how important is it

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.569 
as a learning tool how important is it
to<00:03:22.140> have<00:03:22.350> things<00:03:22.500> like<00:03:22.709> a<00:03:22.739> metronome<00:03:23.100> and<00:03:23.489> a

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
to have things like a metronome and a

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:26.630 
to have things like a metronome and a
record<00:03:23.970> feature<00:03:24.239> to<00:03:24.480> be<00:03:24.510> able<00:03:24.720> to<00:03:25.049> sort<00:03:25.680> of<00:03:25.859> use

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
record feature to be able to sort of use

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.610 
record feature to be able to sort of use
it<00:03:26.790> as<00:03:26.910> a<00:03:26.940> home<00:03:27.150> training<00:03:27.420> -<00:03:27.630> yeah<00:03:27.780> three<00:03:28.319> years

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
it as a home training - yeah three years

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.590 
it as a home training - yeah three years
have<00:03:28.829> been<00:03:28.859> using<00:03:29.370> an<00:03:29.609> electronic<00:03:30.090> drum<00:03:30.269> set

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
have been using an electronic drum set

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.229 
have been using an electronic drum set
to<00:03:30.930> practice<00:03:31.350> on<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:31.799> as<00:03:32.280> far<00:03:32.459> as<00:03:32.519> having<00:03:32.819> a

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
to practice on and as far as having a

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.319 
to practice on and as far as having a
metronome<00:03:33.959> I<00:03:34.380> mean<00:03:34.590> it's<00:03:34.739> amazing<00:03:34.920> to<00:03:35.190> have

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
metronome I mean it's amazing to have

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:37.759 
metronome I mean it's amazing to have
and<00:03:36.329> also<00:03:36.630> playing<00:03:36.870> along<00:03:37.109> with<00:03:37.139> songs<00:03:37.500> that

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
and also playing along with songs that

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.849 
and also playing along with songs that
are<00:03:37.889> programmed<00:03:38.280> into<00:03:38.790> a<00:03:39.209> drum<00:03:39.590> brain<00:03:40.590> like

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
are programmed into a drum brain like

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:42.710 
are programmed into a drum brain like
this<00:03:41.130> having<00:03:41.489> the<00:03:41.639> the<00:03:42.060> Latin<00:03:42.329> song<00:03:42.510> at<00:03:42.660> the

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
this having the the Latin song at the

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.090 
this having the the Latin song at the
jazz<00:03:42.900> song<00:03:43.139> at<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.319> rock<00:03:43.470> song<00:03:43.709> at<00:03:43.829> the<00:03:43.889> funk

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
jazz song at the rock song at the funk

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:55.530 
jazz song at the rock song at the funk
song<00:03:45.019> really<00:03:46.019> helps

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.400 

moving<00:03:56.540> on<00:03:56.660> from<00:03:56.690> the<00:03:56.930> brain<00:03:57.110> let's<00:03:57.290> talk

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
moving on from the brain let's talk

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.080 
moving on from the brain let's talk
about<00:03:57.530> the<00:03:57.650> drum<00:03:57.890> pads<00:03:58.160> and<00:03:58.430> trigger<00:03:58.670> starting

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
about the drum pads and trigger starting
