00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
central point and once you do you can

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.350 
central point and once you do you can
zoom<00:00:34.770> out<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.010> little<00:00:35.160> bit<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.760> make<00:00:35.910> things<00:00:36.210> a

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
zoom out a little bit to make things a

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.630 
zoom out a little bit to make things a
little<00:00:36.450> easier<00:00:36.780> oh<00:00:37.340> not<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:38.520> far<00:00:40.399> that's<00:00:41.399> a

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
little easier oh not that far that's a

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.450 
little easier oh not that far that's a
little<00:00:41.850> too<00:00:42.329> far<00:00:42.739> we<00:00:43.739> do<00:00:43.860> have<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.010> limited

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
little too far we do have a limited

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.619 
little too far we do have a limited
service<00:00:44.730> area<00:00:45.300> all<00:00:46.050> right<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:46.980> let's<00:00:47.190> say

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
service area all right so let's say

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:49.670 
service area all right so let's say
let's<00:00:48.629> say<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.899> looks<00:00:49.140> good

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
let's say that looks good

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.229 
let's say that looks good
then<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.610> go<00:00:50.760> over<00:00:51.000> here<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.300> my<00:00:52.050> maps<00:00:53.239> create

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
then you go over here to my maps create

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:03.490 
then you go over here to my maps create
new<00:00:54.510> map<00:00:56.390> type<00:00:57.390> in<00:00:57.629> what<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:58.050> want<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.410> call<00:00:58.649> it

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.970 

and<00:01:04.190> you<00:01:04.640> could<00:01:04.790> choose<00:01:05.000> to<00:01:05.059> keep<00:01:05.390> it<00:01:05.600> public

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:05.980 
and you could choose to keep it public

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.740 
and you could choose to keep it public
we<00:01:06.980> are<00:01:07.010> going<00:01:07.550> to<00:01:07.820> embed<00:01:08.150> it<00:01:08.270> on<00:01:08.360> our<00:01:08.510> website

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
we are going to embed it on our website

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.260 
we are going to embed it on our website
so<00:01:09.320> I<00:01:09.680> don't<00:01:09.950> think<00:01:10.040> it<00:01:10.190> matters<00:01:10.280> too<00:01:10.610> much<00:01:10.790> but

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
so I don't think it matters too much but

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.270 
so I don't think it matters too much but
for<00:01:11.570> the<00:01:11.690> sake<00:01:11.840> of<00:01:11.870> this<00:01:12.050> tutorial<00:01:12.710> I<00:01:12.890> am<00:01:12.920> going

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
for the sake of this tutorial I am going

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.700 
for the sake of this tutorial I am going
to<00:01:13.640> keep<00:01:13.820> mine<00:01:14.030> unlisted<00:01:14.810> because<00:01:14.930> it<00:01:15.260> is<00:01:15.380> just

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
to keep mine unlisted because it is just

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.230 
to keep mine unlisted because it is just
a<00:01:15.830> working<00:01:16.820> example<00:01:17.440> so<00:01:18.440> we<00:01:18.920> click<00:01:19.160> Save<00:01:19.460> and

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
a working example so we click Save and

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.360 
a working example so we click Save and
now<00:01:20.930> here's<00:01:21.230> where<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:21.440> fun<00:01:21.560> begins

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370 
now here's where the fun begins

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.520 
now here's where the fun begins
we'll<00:01:22.760> click<00:01:22.970> this<00:01:23.150> we<00:01:23.930> could<00:01:24.080> either<00:01:24.170> draw<00:01:24.500> a

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
we'll click this we could either draw a

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.160 
we'll click this we could either draw a
line<00:01:24.830> draw<00:01:25.400> a<00:01:25.430> line<00:01:25.700> along<00:01:25.970> roads<00:01:26.300> or<00:01:26.660> draw<00:01:27.110> a

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
line draw a line along roads or draw a

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.620 
line draw a line along roads or draw a
shape<00:01:27.410> I<00:01:27.710> say<00:01:28.220> we<00:01:28.370> start<00:01:28.610> with<00:01:28.790> a<00:01:28.820> shape<00:01:29.030> so

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
shape I say we start with a shape so

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.870 
shape I say we start with a shape so
here<00:01:29.930> is<00:01:30.080> my<00:01:30.230> address<00:01:30.530> bullet<00:01:31.430> point<00:01:31.670> that<00:01:31.850> I

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
here is my address bullet point that I

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.970 
here is my address bullet point that I
first<00:01:32.270> started<00:01:32.780> searching<00:01:33.290> for<00:01:33.500> when<00:01:33.860> we

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:33.980 
first started searching for when we

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.000 
first started searching for when we
began<00:01:34.280> so<00:01:35.000> let's<00:01:35.479> say<00:01:35.660> this<00:01:36.320> is<00:01:36.380> my<00:01:36.530> service

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010 
began so let's say this is my service

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.050 
began so let's say this is my service
area<00:01:37.340> I<00:01:37.580> click<00:01:38.119> and<00:01:39.220> it<00:01:40.220> starts<00:01:40.550> creating<00:01:40.729> this

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
area I click and it starts creating this

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.850 
area I click and it starts creating this
I<00:01:41.350> go<00:01:42.350> up<00:01:42.680> to<00:01:42.890> this<00:01:43.010> tree<00:01:43.310> I<00:01:43.460> click<00:01:43.790> again<00:01:43.940> I

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
I go up to this tree I click again I

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.140 
I go up to this tree I click again I
will<00:01:45.860> go<00:01:46.270> down<00:01:47.270> to<00:01:47.720> this<00:01:48.140> road<00:01:48.580> over<00:01:49.580> to<00:01:50.030> the

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
will go down to this road over to the

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.080 
will go down to this road over to the
highway<00:01:50.509> here<00:01:50.960> and<00:01:51.310> once<00:01:52.310> you<00:01:52.610> hit<00:01:52.880> your

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
highway here and once you hit your

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.940 
highway here and once you hit your
initial<00:01:53.420> point<00:01:53.630> it'll<00:01:53.990> turn<00:01:54.170> back<00:01:54.590> into<00:01:54.830> a

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
initial point it'll turn back into a

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.180 
initial point it'll turn back into a
hand<00:01:55.250> click<00:01:55.820> it<00:01:55.940> again<00:01:56.030> and<00:01:56.650> so<00:01:57.650> far<00:01:57.890> we<00:01:58.009> have<00:01:58.160> a

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
hand click it again and so far we have a

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.460 
hand click it again and so far we have a
good<00:01:58.340> looking<00:01:58.610> service<00:01:58.940> area<00:01:59.270> they<00:02:00.170> allow<00:02:00.440> us

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
good looking service area they allow us

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.160 
good looking service area they allow us
to<00:02:00.710> customize<00:02:01.190> it<00:02:01.580> so<00:02:02.119> I<00:02:02.360> don't<00:02:02.840> really<00:02:02.900> like

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
to customize it so I don't really like

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.050 
to customize it so I don't really like
this<00:02:03.350> color<00:02:03.619> I'll<00:02:03.860> up<00:02:04.610> for<00:02:05.150> a<00:02:05.479> lighter<00:02:05.900> color<00:02:06.320> I

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
this color I'll up for a lighter color I

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.580 
this color I'll up for a lighter color I
will<00:02:08.060> adjust<00:02:08.290> the<00:02:09.290> opacity<00:02:09.679> so<00:02:10.250> I<00:02:10.280> could<00:02:10.550> see

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
will adjust the opacity so I could see

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.870 
will adjust the opacity so I could see
see<00:02:12.590> it<00:02:12.680> a<00:02:12.709> little<00:02:12.830> better<00:02:13.070> you<00:02:13.340> can<00:02:13.459> also<00:02:13.610> mess

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
see it a little better you can also mess

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.900 
see it a little better you can also mess
with<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.150> line<00:02:14.330> color<00:02:14.570> in<00:02:14.840> line<00:02:15.050> with<00:02:15.910> when

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
with the line color in line with when

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:23.570
