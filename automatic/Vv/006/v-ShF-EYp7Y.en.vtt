show<00:00:04.049> you<00:00:04.110> the<00:00:04.529> new<00:00:05.000> sugarcane<00:00:06.000> from<00:00:06.299> my<00:00:06.690> belt

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
show you the new sugarcane from my belt

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.020 
show you the new sugarcane from my belt
it's<00:00:07.830> an<00:00:08.130> afk<00:00:08.580> phone<00:00:09.769> it's<00:00:11.030> semi-automatic

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
it's an afk phone it's semi-automatic

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.140 
it's an afk phone it's semi-automatic
you<00:00:12.450> have<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:12.990> be<00:00:13.740> inside<00:00:14.340> of<00:00:14.549> it<00:00:16.460> the<00:00:17.460> way<00:00:17.670> the

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
you have to be inside of it the way the

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.140 
you have to be inside of it the way the
way<00:00:18.300> it<00:00:18.420> works<00:00:18.630> is<00:00:19.050> it<00:00:20.010> uses<00:00:20.279> glitching<00:00:20.970> my

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
way it works is it uses glitching my

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.460 
way it works is it uses glitching my
cards<00:00:21.600> sends<00:00:22.590> them<00:00:22.740> down<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.250> back<00:00:23.490> up<00:00:24.470> and

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
cards sends them down and back up and

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.009 
cards sends them down and back up and
then<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:25.769> have<00:00:26.189> your<00:00:26.580> maths<00:00:26.880> key<00:00:27.180> press<00:00:27.689> down

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
then you have your maths key press down

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.849 
then you have your maths key press down
by<00:00:28.320> something

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
by something

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.370 
by something
or<00:00:29.070> if<00:00:29.910> you<00:00:30.090> press<00:00:30.390> it<00:00:30.420> down<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:30.960> then<00:00:31.080> unplug

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
or if you press it down and then unplug

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.680 
or if you press it down and then unplug
it<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:32.040> computer<00:00:32.579> thinks<00:00:32.910> if<00:00:33.120> it's<00:00:33.300> still

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
it the computer thinks if it's still

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.799 
it the computer thinks if it's still
clicking<00:00:34.290> down<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:34.980> then<00:00:35.910> you're<00:00:36.300> beginning

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
clicking down and then you're beginning

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:37.850 
clicking down and then you're beginning
along<00:00:37.020> in<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.230> minecart

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
along in a minecart

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.160 
along in a minecart
you'll<00:00:38.579> break<00:00:38.850> all<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.270> blocks<00:00:39.510> as<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:39.960> go

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
you'll break all the blocks as you go

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.400 
you'll break all the blocks as you go
and<00:00:40.770> when<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.040> can<00:00:41.219> make<00:00:41.370> your<00:00:41.640> pick<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.059> up

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
and when you can make your pick it up

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.920 
and when you can make your pick it up
the<00:00:43.410> only<00:00:43.680> block<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:44.579> might<00:00:44.940> not<00:00:45.570> break

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
the only block that you might not break

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.920 
the only block that you might not break
I<00:00:46.320> found<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.190> didn't<00:00:47.520> break<00:00:47.670> this<00:00:47.910> one<00:00:48.149> here<00:00:48.420> so

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
I found I didn't break this one here so

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.979 
I found I didn't break this one here so
it's<00:00:49.770> kind<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:50.039> useless<00:00:50.460> so<00:00:50.820> I'll<00:00:51.690> show<00:00:51.960> you

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
it's kind of useless so I'll show you

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.439 
it's kind of useless so I'll show you
how<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.260> build<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.710> in<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.920> minute<00:00:53.219> this<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.270> how

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
how to build it in a minute this is how

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.350 
how to build it in a minute this is how
you<00:00:54.510> get<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.899> minecart<00:00:55.350> into<00:00:55.770> position<00:00:56.360> the

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
you get the minecart into position the

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.080 
you get the minecart into position the
minimum<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:57.989> can<00:00:58.020> have<00:00:58.379> it's<00:00:58.649> free<00:00:59.160> ice<00:00:59.520> just

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
minimum you can have it's free ice just

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.180 
minimum you can have it's free ice just
been<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.420> bit<00:01:00.570> more<00:01:00.719> in

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
been a bit more in

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.119 
been a bit more in
sometimes<00:01:02.579> they<00:01:02.760> let<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.149> found<00:01:03.390> otherwise

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
sometimes they let you found otherwise

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.480 
sometimes they let you found otherwise
and<00:01:05.129> off<00:01:05.280> they<00:01:05.519> go<00:01:05.549> down<00:01:06.030> like<00:01:06.299> this<00:01:07.100> if<00:01:08.100> we<00:01:08.310> can

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
and off they go down like this if we can

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.550 
and off they go down like this if we can
get<00:01:08.700> on<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:09.000> this<00:01:09.270> end<00:01:09.540> sometimes<00:01:10.110> it's<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.409> bit

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
get on it this end sometimes it's a bit

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.219 
get on it this end sometimes it's a bit
hard<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.860> get<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.280> if<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.119> just<00:01:12.299> keep<00:01:12.690> letting

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
hard to get in if you just keep letting

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.070 
hard to get in if you just keep letting
that<00:01:14.180> so<00:01:15.180> I'll<00:01:15.330> show<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:16.320> want<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.590> face<00:01:16.830> a

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
that so I'll show you you want to face a

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.690 
that so I'll show you you want to face a
direction<00:01:19.080> where<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.220> know<00:01:20.399> you're<00:01:20.610> not

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
direction where you know you're not

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.030 
direction where you know you're not
going<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.940> break<00:01:21.119> anything<00:01:21.420> if<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:21.950> hold<00:01:22.950> down

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
going to break anything if you hold down

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.020 
going to break anything if you hold down
the<00:01:23.430> clicker

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
the clicker

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.300 
the clicker
and<00:01:25.150> then<00:01:25.360> you're<00:01:25.570> just<00:01:25.720> like<00:01:25.930> this<00:01:26.170> and<00:01:26.500> I<00:01:27.160> see

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
and then you're just like this and I see

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.740 
and then you're just like this and I see
sugarcane<00:01:28.030> rose

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
sugarcane rose

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.770 
sugarcane rose
he<00:01:29.320> destroyed<00:01:29.890> I'm<00:01:30.190> not<00:01:30.520> in<00:01:30.670> Survivor<00:01:31.270> mode<00:01:31.420> at

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
he destroyed I'm not in Survivor mode at

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.590 
he destroyed I'm not in Survivor mode at
the<00:01:31.840> moment

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
the moment

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.570 
the moment
see<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.320> one's<00:01:34.530> still<00:01:34.800> that<00:01:35.010> but<00:01:35.400> we'll

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
see that one's still that but we'll

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.640 
see that one's still that but we'll
break<00:01:35.790> down<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.180> next<00:01:36.480> round<00:01:36.720> it's<00:01:37.230> no<00:01:37.470> big

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
break down the next round it's no big

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.830 
break down the next round it's no big
deal<00:01:37.860> all<00:01:38.550> the<00:01:38.610> ones<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.090> we<00:01:39.210> don't<00:01:39.450> pick<00:01:39.660> up

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
deal all the ones that we don't pick up

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.200 
deal all the ones that we don't pick up
will<00:01:40.110> pick<00:01:40.320> up<00:01:40.470> on<00:01:40.620> the<00:01:40.710> next<00:01:40.860> round<00:01:41.190> you<00:01:42.000> see

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
will pick up on the next round you see

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.940 
will pick up on the next round you see
what<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.480> mean<00:01:42.690> about<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:43.110> glitching<00:01:43.530> up<00:01:43.680> that

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
what I mean about the glitching up that

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.720 
what I mean about the glitching up that
was<00:01:44.100> only<00:01:44.310> three<00:01:44.760> my<00:01:44.970> guts<00:01:45.240> in<00:01:45.420> there<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:46.730> it

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:47.730 
was only three my guts in there and it

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.510 
was only three my guts in there and it
glitched<00:01:48.060> up<00:01:48.360> if<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.870> have<00:01:49.080> four<00:01:49.410> or<00:01:49.530> five<00:01:49.770> it

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
glitched up if you have four or five it

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.510 
glitched up if you have four or five it
should<00:01:50.580> be<00:01:51.000> fine

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
should be fine

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.590 
should be fine
so<00:01:53.520> this<00:01:53.729> one<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.570> another<00:01:55.080> design<00:01:56.330> this<00:01:57.330> one

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
so this one is another design this one

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.590 
so this one is another design this one
goes<00:01:57.870> round<00:01:58.760> it's<00:01:59.760> a<00:01:59.970> bit<00:02:00.150> more<00:02:00.330> space

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
goes round it's a bit more space

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.570 
goes round it's a bit more space
efficient<00:02:02.330> so<00:02:03.590> this<00:02:04.590> one<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:05.010> can't<00:02:05.280> get<00:02:05.430> in

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
efficient so this one you can't get in

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.870 
efficient so this one you can't get in
monsters<00:02:06.060> going<00:02:06.619> but<00:02:07.619> it's<00:02:08.490> the<00:02:08.640> same

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
monsters going but it's the same

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.770 
monsters going but it's the same
principle

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
principle

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.740 
principle
it<00:02:10.259> would<00:02:10.560> have<00:02:10.740> walls<00:02:11.040> then<00:02:11.459> one<00:02:11.610> up<00:02:11.820> nice<00:02:12.720> and

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
it would have walls then one up nice and

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.840 
it would have walls then one up nice and
high<00:02:13.050> so<00:02:13.170> you<00:02:13.530> don't<00:02:13.800> need<00:02:13.980> any<00:02:14.310> sugar<00:02:14.340> cane

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
high so you don't need any sugar cane

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.449 
high so you don't need any sugar cane
out<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.209> side<00:02:15.450> but<00:02:16.170> I<00:02:16.230> want<00:02:16.560> to<00:02:16.890> keep<00:02:17.070> it<00:02:17.250> easy

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
out the side but I want to keep it easy

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:18.600 
out the side but I want to keep it easy
too

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
too

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.230 
too
see<00:02:19.150> how<00:02:19.360> say<00:02:20.170> you<00:02:20.370> it's<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.490> same<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:22.120> other

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
see how say you it's the same the other

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.340 
see how say you it's the same the other
one<00:02:22.450> you'll<00:02:22.690> just<00:02:22.960> get<00:02:23.140> rid<00:02:23.290> of<00:02:23.350> like<00:02:23.530> this

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
one you'll just get rid of like this

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.340 
one you'll just get rid of like this
there<00:02:26.350> are<00:02:26.530> these<00:02:27.310> on<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:27.760> corner<00:02:28.210> to<00:02:29.080> turn

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
there are these on the corner to turn

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.790 
there are these on the corner to turn
you<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:30.040> way<00:02:30.190> that<00:02:30.490> you<00:02:31.120> make<00:02:31.360> them<00:02:31.630> is<00:02:31.840> to<00:02:32.680> go

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
you the way that you make them is to go

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.210 
you the way that you make them is to go
like<00:02:32.980> that

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
like that

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.750 
like that
and<00:02:33.460> then<00:02:33.550> break<00:02:33.760> these<00:02:33.970> two<00:02:34.210> box<00:02:34.500> will<00:02:35.500> turn

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
and then break these two box will turn

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.920 
and then break these two box will turn
that<00:02:36.760> you<00:02:36.940> need<00:02:37.120> to<00:02:37.210> make<00:02:37.390> sure<00:02:37.420> you<00:02:37.750> have<00:02:37.900> a

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
that you need to make sure you have a

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.960 
that you need to make sure you have a
block<00:02:38.230> here<00:02:38.260> or<00:02:39.190> block<00:02:39.490> there<00:02:39.730> because

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
block here or block there because

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.970 
block here or block there because
otherwise<00:02:40.300> the<00:02:40.780> my<00:02:40.930> cut<00:02:41.170> will<00:02:41.350> come<00:02:41.560> down<00:02:41.740> here

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
otherwise the my cut will come down here

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.390 
otherwise the my cut will come down here
and<00:02:42.520> just<00:02:42.880> go<00:02:43.090> off<00:02:43.240> in<00:02:43.450> what<00:02:43.630> direction

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
and just go off in what direction

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.369 
and just go off in what direction
so<00:02:45.549> now<00:02:45.730> I'll<00:02:45.909> show<00:02:45.939> you<00:02:46.150> how<00:02:46.420> it's<00:02:46.840> made

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:47.379 
so now I'll show you how it's made

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.009 
so now I'll show you how it's made
you'll<00:02:48.010> notice<00:02:48.250> on<00:02:48.879> this<00:02:49.120> one<00:02:49.329> I<00:02:49.360> have<00:02:49.629> sand

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
you'll notice on this one I have sand

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.789 
you'll notice on this one I have sand
instead<00:02:50.650> of<00:02:50.950> dirt<00:02:51.780> that's<00:02:52.780> an<00:02:52.989> optional<00:02:53.470> thing

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
instead of dirt that's an optional thing

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.449 
instead of dirt that's an optional thing
I<00:02:54.040> had<00:02:54.790> somewhere<00:02:55.180> that<00:02:55.390> it<00:02:55.540> grows<00:02:55.750> faster

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
I had somewhere that it grows faster

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.580 
I had somewhere that it grows faster
sugarcane<00:02:57.459> grows<00:02:57.760> faster<00:02:58.540> on<00:02:58.689> something<00:02:59.349> as

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
sugarcane grows faster on something as

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.319 
sugarcane grows faster on something as
on<00:02:59.829> dirt<00:03:00.069> but<00:03:00.310> I'm<00:03:00.400> not<00:03:00.519> sure<00:03:00.730> if<00:03:00.819> that<00:03:00.849> still

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
on dirt but I'm not sure if that still

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:04.410 
on dirt but I'm not sure if that still
applies<00:03:02.010> all<00:03:03.010> of<00:03:03.069> the<00:03:03.430> water<00:03:03.670> gets<00:03:04.180> down

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
applies all of the water gets down

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.050 
applies all of the water gets down
underneath<00:03:04.959> the<00:03:05.439> stone<00:03:05.920> it's<00:03:06.489> pretty<00:03:06.760> neat

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
underneath the stone it's pretty neat

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.569 
underneath the stone it's pretty neat
you<00:03:07.390> need<00:03:08.200> to<00:03:08.349> build<00:03:08.530> up<00:03:08.739> the<00:03:08.980> stone<00:03:09.250> on<00:03:09.430> the

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
you need to build up the stone on the

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.640 
you need to build up the stone on the
side<00:03:09.819> so<00:03:10.150> you<00:03:10.209> don't<00:03:10.420> lose<00:03:10.659> any<00:03:10.900> over<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.319> top

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
side so you don't lose any over the top

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.289 
side so you don't lose any over the top
and<00:03:13.200> but<00:03:14.200> apart<00:03:14.379> from<00:03:14.680> that<00:03:14.859> that's<00:03:15.370> it<00:03:15.790> really

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
and but apart from that that's it really

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.949 
and but apart from that that's it really
these<00:03:17.639> this<00:03:18.639> water<00:03:18.909> doesn't<00:03:19.299> need<00:03:19.629> to<00:03:19.810> be

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
these this water doesn't need to be

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.740 
these this water doesn't need to be
source<00:03:20.920> but<00:03:21.190> so<00:03:21.459> long<00:03:21.639> as<00:03:21.700> you<00:03:22.030> can<00:03:22.239> grow<00:03:22.450> sugar

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
source but so long as you can grow sugar

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:23.670 
source but so long as you can grow sugar
cane<00:03:22.930> back

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
cane back

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.970 
cane back
it's<00:03:24.280> fine<00:03:24.670> or<00:03:25.450> say<00:03:25.930> you<00:03:25.989> need<00:03:26.319> to<00:03:26.349> build<00:03:26.680> this

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
it's fine or say you need to build this

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.379 
it's fine or say you need to build this
here<00:03:28.889> I'll<00:03:29.889> just<00:03:30.400> show<00:03:30.609> you<00:03:30.670> how<00:03:30.879> to<00:03:30.939> do<00:03:31.180> that

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:31.389 
here I'll just show you how to do that

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:37.679 
here I'll just show you how to do that
quickly<00:03:32.220> so<00:03:33.220> you<00:03:33.280> want<00:03:33.489> to<00:03:36.540> put<00:03:37.540> your

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:37.689 
quickly so you want to put your

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:39.300 
quickly so you want to put your
chocolate<00:03:37.930> torch<00:03:38.530> down<00:03:38.799> there<00:03:39.069> or<00:03:39.280> something

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
chocolate torch down there or something

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.880 
chocolate torch down there or something
to<00:03:39.909> power<00:03:40.120> this<00:03:40.450> right

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.680 

a<00:03:42.950> block<00:03:43.550> there

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
a block there

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.410 
a block there
all<00:03:45.110> the<00:03:45.260> way<00:03:45.440> if<00:03:45.770> you<00:03:45.950> want<00:03:46.130> to<00:03:46.370> know<00:03:47.120> the<00:03:47.300> one

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
all the way if you want to know the one

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.360 
all the way if you want to know the one
that<00:03:47.630> this<00:03:47.930> can<00:03:48.170> be<00:03:48.320> powered<00:03:48.740> it<00:03:48.920> makes<00:03:49.130> it<00:03:49.340> a

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
that this can be powered it makes it a

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.550 
that this can be powered it makes it a
bit<00:03:49.460> easier<00:03:49.880> but<00:03:50.720> I'm<00:03:50.870> going<00:03:51.080> for<00:03:51.260> cheapness

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
bit easier but I'm going for cheapness

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.310 
bit easier but I'm going for cheapness
here<00:03:52.070> and<00:03:52.610> then<00:03:52.730> you<00:03:52.940> just<00:03:52.970> push<00:03:53.510> my<00:03:53.840> guts<00:03:54.110> into

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
here and then you just push my guts into

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.890 
here and then you just push my guts into
place<00:03:54.680> I<00:03:55.010> made<00:03:55.670> a<00:03:55.700> video<00:03:55.910> on<00:03:56.270> it<00:03:56.420> seat<00:03:56.690> and

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
place I made a video on it seat and

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.560 
place I made a video on it seat and
probably<00:03:57.500> click<00:03:58.370> on<00:03:58.520> the<00:03:58.640> screen<00:03:59.000> somewhat

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
probably click on the screen somewhat

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.920 
probably click on the screen somewhat
and<00:04:00.380> it'll<00:04:00.680> take<00:04:00.860> you<00:04:01.010> to<00:04:01.220> that<00:04:01.510> and<00:04:02.510> again<00:04:02.750> the

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
and it'll take you to that and again the

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.320 
and it'll take you to that and again the
way<00:04:03.050> to<00:04:03.080> do<00:04:03.380> these<00:04:03.560> corner<00:04:04.070> ones<00:04:04.280> that's<00:04:05.030> just

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
way to do these corner ones that's just

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.680 
way to do these corner ones that's just
gonna<00:04:05.480> yeah<00:04:06.490> the<00:04:07.490> way<00:04:07.640> to<00:04:07.700> do<00:04:08.030> the<00:04:08.180> corner<00:04:08.480> ones

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
gonna yeah the way to do the corner ones

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.710 
gonna yeah the way to do the corner ones
like<00:04:09.020> that<00:04:09.260> when<00:04:09.500> they<00:04:09.620> break<00:04:09.860> these<00:04:10.130> blocks

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
like that when they break these blocks

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.020 
like that when they break these blocks
remember<00:04:11.720> you<00:04:11.870> need<00:04:12.020> more<00:04:12.380> than<00:04:12.620> three<00:04:13.010> as<00:04:13.280> I

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
remember you need more than three as I
