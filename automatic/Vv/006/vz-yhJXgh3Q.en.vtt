00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
the heating of them of the milk first I

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.040 
the heating of them of the milk first I
started<00:00:47.579> off<00:00:47.790> on<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:48.000> pan<00:00:48.210> then<00:00:48.780> I'm<00:00:48.899> going<00:00:49.020> to

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
started off on a pan then I'm going to

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:56.299 
started off on a pan then I'm going to
transfer<00:00:51.140> as<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.289> get<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.710> 180<00:00:53.550> degrees<00:00:55.309> I'm

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
transfer as I get to 180 degrees I'm

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.040 
transfer as I get to 180 degrees I'm
going<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.700> put<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:56.940> in<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.149> crock<00:00:57.390> pot<00:00:57.660> for<00:00:57.870> the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
going to put it in the crock pot for the

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.330 
going to put it in the crock pot for the
next<00:00:58.350> step<00:00:59.930> well<00:01:00.930> it's<00:01:01.079> just<00:01:01.140> about<00:01:01.410> at<00:01:01.680> 170

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
next step well it's just about at 170

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.740 
next step well it's just about at 170
degrees<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:03.000> I'm<00:01:03.180> going<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.420> transfer<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.770> now

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
degrees so I'm going to transfer it now

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.600 
degrees so I'm going to transfer it now
into<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:07.070> crock<00:01:08.070> pot<00:01:09.740> and<00:01:10.740> allow<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.220> crock

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
into the crock pot and allow the crock

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:29.149 
into the crock pot and allow the crock
pot<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:12.090> finish<00:01:12.420> eating<00:01:13.409> up<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.650> milk

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:39.300 

so<00:01:30.159> there's<00:01:30.430> the<00:01:37.290> sometimes<00:01:38.290> gets<00:01:38.500> the<00:01:38.649> 180

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
so there's the sometimes gets the 180

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.490 
so there's the sometimes gets the 180
I<00:01:40.590> will<00:01:41.590> unplug<00:01:42.310> it<00:01:42.750> allow<00:01:43.750> the<00:01:43.810> milk<00:01:44.170> to<00:01:44.320> cool

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
I will unplug it allow the milk to cool

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.770 
I will unplug it allow the milk to cool
down<00:01:44.740> to<00:01:44.950> 115<00:01:45.580> and<00:01:45.790> I<00:01:45.850> go<00:01:46.000> to<00:01:46.060> the<00:01:46.299> next<00:01:46.450> step

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
down to 115 and I go to the next step

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.530 
down to 115 and I go to the next step
and<00:01:47.430> it's<00:01:48.430> going<00:01:48.580> to<00:01:48.640> be<00:01:48.820> there<00:01:49.060> in<00:01:49.240> just<00:01:49.270> a

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
and it's going to be there in just a

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.249 
and it's going to be there in just a
couple<00:01:49.720> of<00:01:49.899> seconds<00:01:50.500> and<00:01:50.649> matter<00:01:51.159> of<00:01:51.190> fact

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
couple of seconds and matter of fact

00:01:52.259 --> 00:02:01.109 
couple of seconds and matter of fact
that's<00:01:53.259> 180<00:01:57.570> it's<00:01:58.570> now<00:01:58.810> unplugged<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:01.000> the

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
that's 180 it's now unplugged and the

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.240 
that's 180 it's now unplugged and the
bacteria<00:02:01.659> that<00:02:01.720> would<00:02:02.050> be<00:02:02.979> in<00:02:03.100> conflict<00:02:03.610> with

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
bacteria that would be in conflict with

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.710 
bacteria that would be in conflict with
the<00:02:06.250> good<00:02:06.460> bacteria<00:02:06.640> that<00:02:07.030> we<00:02:07.270> need<00:02:07.479> is

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
the good bacteria that we need is

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.120 
the good bacteria that we need is
probably<00:02:08.259> all<00:02:08.619> dead<00:02:09.459> now<00:02:10.019> so<00:02:11.019> this<00:02:12.010> is

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
probably all dead now so this is

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.759 
probably all dead now so this is
unplugged<00:02:12.580> we<00:02:13.300> leave<00:02:13.480> it<00:02:13.569> alone<00:02:13.630> we'll<00:02:14.470> be

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
unplugged we leave it alone we'll be

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.670 
unplugged we leave it alone we'll be
back<00:02:14.950> here<00:02:14.980> when<00:02:15.340> it<00:02:15.459> says<00:02:15.670> 115<00:02:16.360> to<00:02:17.019> start<00:02:17.380> in

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
back here when it says 115 to start in

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.800 
back here when it says 115 to start in
the<00:02:18.370> half<00:02:18.730> a<00:02:18.880> cup<00:02:19.090> of<00:02:20.730> yogurt<00:02:21.730> store<00:02:22.600> bought

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
the half a cup of yogurt store bought

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.340 
the half a cup of yogurt store bought
yogurt<00:02:24.510> well<00:02:25.510> I'm<00:02:25.600> down<00:02:25.810> to<00:02:26.170> like<00:02:26.470> 112<00:02:27.340> degrees

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
yogurt well I'm down to like 112 degrees

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:34.250 
yogurt well I'm down to like 112 degrees
so<00:02:29.350> I'm<00:02:29.650> going<00:02:29.829> to<00:02:29.860> add<00:02:30.070> the<00:02:31.440> yogurt<00:02:32.440> right<00:02:32.829> now

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
so I'm going to add the yogurt right now

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:41.200 
so I'm going to add the yogurt right now
give<00:02:35.260> it<00:02:35.290> a<00:02:35.440> mix

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.840 

that's<00:02:42.210> nice<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.660> thick<00:02:42.870> that<00:02:42.900> Greek<00:02:43.290> yogurt

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
that's nice and thick that Greek yogurt

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.710 
that's nice and thick that Greek yogurt
so<00:02:44.850> if<00:02:44.970> you're<00:02:45.180> going<00:02:45.330> to<00:02:46.880> use<00:02:47.880> powdered<00:02:48.510> milk

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
so if you're going to use powdered milk

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.980 
so if you're going to use powdered milk
wall<00:02:48.990> so<00:02:49.290> you<00:02:49.380> can<00:02:49.620> add<00:02:49.800> like<00:02:50.040> a<00:02:50.960> couple<00:02:51.960> of

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
wall so you can add like a couple of

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.950 
wall so you can add like a couple of
tablespoons<00:02:52.380> now<00:02:53.360> that'll<00:02:54.360> give<00:02:54.510> it<00:02:54.540> a<00:02:54.690> real

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
tablespoons now that'll give it a real

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.240 
tablespoons now that'll give it a real
thickness<00:02:56.810> if<00:02:57.810> I<00:02:57.990> had<00:02:58.200> something<00:02:58.650> around<00:02:58.950> I

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
thickness if I had something around I

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:05.900 
thickness if I had something around I
would<00:02:59.400> use<00:02:59.580> it<00:02:59.790> but<00:03:00.060> I<00:03:00.150> don't<00:03:04.610> so<00:03:05.610> now<00:03:05.730> we'll

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
would use it but I don't so now we'll

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:47.330 
would use it but I don't so now we'll
just<00:03:07.040> get<00:03:08.040> blows<00:03:08.280> it<00:03:08.550> off<00:03:44.360> wrap<00:03:45.360> this<00:03:45.570> up<00:03:45.840> and<00:03:46.340> a

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
just get blows it off wrap this up and a

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.590 
just get blows it off wrap this up and a
nice<00:03:47.550> cool<00:03:48.030> place<00:03:49.400> where<00:03:50.400> there's<00:03:50.940> no<00:03:51.060> breeze

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.390 

I'm<00:03:54.600> gonna<00:03:54.810> put<00:03:55.050> this<00:03:55.170> in<00:03:55.380> the<00:03:55.410> oven<00:03:58.130> and<00:03:59.130> I'll

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
I'm gonna put this in the oven and I'll

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.550

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
watching TV and we'll see what it looks

like<00:04:10.760> well<00:04:11.989> there's<00:04:12.989> the<00:04:13.350> yogurt<00:04:15.769> 12<00:04:16.769> hours
