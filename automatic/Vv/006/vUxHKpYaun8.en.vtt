Wobbuffet<00:02:40.290> does<00:02:40.799> it<00:02:40.950> just<00:02:41.310> make<00:02:41.459> sense<00:02:41.700> that

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
Wobbuffet does it just make sense that

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.550 
Wobbuffet does it just make sense that
if<00:02:42.239> you<00:02:42.510> do<00:02:42.659> damage<00:02:43.049> you're<00:02:43.260> going<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.500> be

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
if you do damage you're going to be

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.050 
if you do damage you're going to be
gaining<00:02:43.769> an<00:02:43.950> eighth<00:02:44.099> that<00:02:44.310> damage<00:02:44.640> back<00:02:44.849> if

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
gaining an eighth that damage back if

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.970 
gaining an eighth that damage back if
your<00:02:45.269> one<00:02:45.510> hit<00:02:45.660> ko<00:02:45.840> in<00:02:45.989> your<00:02:46.109> Pokemon<00:02:46.590> or<00:02:46.769> your

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
your one hit ko in your Pokemon or your

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.199 
your one hit ko in your Pokemon or your
opponent<00:02:47.340> we're<00:02:47.700> doing<00:02:47.879> a<00:02:47.910> lot<00:02:48.030> of<00:02:48.060> damage

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
opponent we're doing a lot of damage

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.509 
opponent we're doing a lot of damage
with<00:02:48.450> counter<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:48.989> Mirko<00:02:49.440> just<00:02:50.190> makes<00:02:50.340> sense

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
with counter and Mirko just makes sense

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.369 
with counter and Mirko just makes sense
now<00:02:50.790> unfortunately<00:02:51.420> I<00:02:51.599> don't<00:02:51.989> think<00:02:52.170> it

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
now unfortunately I don't think it

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:53.630 
now unfortunately I don't think it
really<00:02:52.470> works<00:02:52.620> out<00:02:52.980> too<00:02:53.129> well<00:02:53.280> that<00:02:53.310> you<00:02:53.519> have

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
really works out too well that you have

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.160 
really works out too well that you have
more<00:02:53.910> hit<00:02:54.060> points<00:02:54.090> than<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.510> average<00:02:54.750> Pokemon

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
more hit points than the average Pokemon

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.050 
more hit points than the average Pokemon
so<00:02:55.650> you're<00:02:55.769> not<00:02:55.920> going<00:02:56.160> to<00:02:56.280> quite<00:02:56.579> be<00:02:56.640> getting

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
so you're not going to quite be getting

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.550 
so you're not going to quite be getting
an<00:02:57.180> eighth<00:02:57.329> of<00:02:57.450> your<00:02:57.599> health<00:02:57.720> back<00:02:57.930> on<00:02:58.109> even<00:02:58.379> a

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
an eighth of your health back on even a

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.949 
an eighth of your health back on even a
one-hit<00:02:58.920> ko<00:02:59.099> if<00:02:59.609> it's<00:02:59.849> a<00:02:59.909> 2<00:03:00.060> hit<00:03:00.239> ko<00:03:00.390> that<00:03:00.780> means

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
one-hit ko if it's a 2 hit ko that means

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.119 
one-hit ko if it's a 2 hit ko that means
you're<00:03:01.109> getting<00:03:01.200> less<00:03:01.530> than<00:03:01.560> an<00:03:01.859> eighth<00:03:02.010> of

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
you're getting less than an eighth of

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:03.649 
you're getting less than an eighth of
your<00:03:02.250> help<00:03:02.400> in<00:03:02.579> two<00:03:03.030> turns<00:03:03.269> betweens

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
your help in two turns betweens

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:05.300 
your help in two turns betweens
leftovers<00:03:04.109> it's<00:03:04.620> just<00:03:04.799> going<00:03:04.950> to<00:03:05.069> be<00:03:05.159> better

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
leftovers it's just going to be better

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.979 
leftovers it's just going to be better
that<00:03:05.459> if<00:03:05.879> you're<00:03:06.209> thinking<00:03:06.540> should<00:03:06.750> I<00:03:06.810> use

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
that if you're thinking should I use

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.140 
that if you're thinking should I use
shell<00:03:07.200> bell<00:03:07.379> just<00:03:07.920> think<00:03:08.310> leftovers<00:03:08.819> instead

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
shell bell just think leftovers instead

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.819 
shell bell just think leftovers instead
because<00:03:09.390> unless<00:03:09.629> you're<00:03:09.780> scoring<00:03:10.079> one<00:03:10.650> hit

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
because unless you're scoring one hit

because unless you're scoring one hit
Kos<00:03:11.129> all<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.489> time<00:03:11.670> shell<00:03:12.239> Bell<00:03:12.420> is<00:03:12.629> going<00:03:12.900> to

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
Kos all the time shell Bell is going to

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.589 
Kos all the time shell Bell is going to
be<00:03:13.230> as<00:03:13.609> efficient<00:03:14.609> as<00:03:14.700> leftovers<00:03:15.180> if<00:03:15.329> not

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
be as efficient as leftovers if not

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.839 
be as efficient as leftovers if not
worse<00:03:15.810> so<00:03:16.260> that's<00:03:16.980> just<00:03:17.159> going<00:03:17.370> to<00:03:17.459> be<00:03:17.549> one<00:03:17.819> of

worse so that's just going to be one of

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:18.979 
worse so that's just going to be one of
your<00:03:18.000> things<00:03:18.150> to<00:03:18.359> worry<00:03:18.540> about<00:03:18.569> from<00:03:18.870> there

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
your things to worry about from there

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.659 
your things to worry about from there
just<00:03:19.169> use<00:03:19.290> leftovers<00:03:19.769> and<00:03:19.889> that's<00:03:20.370> all<00:03:20.519> there

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:20.669 
just use leftovers and that's all there

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:21.949 
just use leftovers and that's all there
is<00:03:20.700> to<00:03:20.940> wobbuffet<00:03:21.329> that<00:03:21.480> you<00:03:21.569> just<00:03:21.750> run

is to wobbuffet that you just run

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.629 
is to wobbuffet that you just run
defensive<00:03:22.470> nature<00:03:22.590> that<00:03:23.250> way<00:03:23.370> you're<00:03:23.519> getting

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
defensive nature that way you're getting

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
a little more physical defensive edge

a little more physical defensive edge
2880<00:03:26.310> vs<00:03:26.730> into<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.090> hip<00:03:27.209> points<00:03:27.450> is<00:03:27.540> going<00:03:27.750> to

2880 vs into the hip points is going to

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:28.940 
2880 vs into the hip points is going to
mean<00:03:27.930> that<00:03:27.959> you<00:03:28.169> get<00:03:28.319> an<00:03:28.440> even<00:03:28.709> distribution

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
mean that you get an even distribution

the<00:03:36.540> full<00:03:36.750> 16<00:03:37.200> and<00:03:37.410> that's<00:03:38.040> really<00:03:38.280> that<00:03:38.519> was

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
the full 16 and that's really that was

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.039 
the full 16 and that's really that was
complicated<00:03:38.849> as<00:03:39.120> well<00:03:39.209> but<00:03:39.299> that<00:03:39.359> gets<00:03:39.569> they

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
complicated as well but that gets they

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:41.479 
complicated as well but that gets they

they're going to set up and then you

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:49.970

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
play around it really well that's all

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:50.900 
play around it really well that's all
there<00:03:50.069> is<00:03:50.160> to<00:03:50.310> love<00:03:50.430> with<00:03:50.519> it<00:03:50.609> so<00:03:50.730> I<00:03:50.760> hope<00:03:50.849> you
