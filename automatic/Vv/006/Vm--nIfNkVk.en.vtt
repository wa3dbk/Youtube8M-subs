00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
felt it was reasonably priced once you

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.449 
felt it was reasonably priced once you
look<00:03:04.050> at<00:03:04.140> all<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.410> machine<00:03:04.739> work<00:03:04.920> that's<00:03:05.190> done

you install this kit that I spun all the
spark<00:03:20.010> plugs<00:03:20.280> out<00:03:20.430> got<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.150> motor<00:03:21.360> turn<00:03:21.630> on

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460

I mean you know they died off so slow
you<00:04:36.940> don't<00:04:37.060> notice<00:04:37.270> how<00:04:37.540> weak<00:04:37.750> it's<00:04:37.930> getting<00:04:38.320> I

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
you don't notice how weak it's getting I

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.230 
you don't notice how weak it's getting I
thought<00:04:38.740> I<00:04:38.770> had<00:04:38.980> a<00:04:39.010> good<00:04:39.160> good<00:04:39.610> running<00:04:39.850> sound

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
thought I had a good good running sound

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.870

anyway this is part one I've got access
to<00:04:52.720> a<00:04:52.900> dyno<00:04:53.230> I'm<00:04:53.650> going<00:04:54.220> to<00:04:54.280> have<00:04:54.370> this<00:04:54.490> thing

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
to a dyno I'm going to have this thing

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.340 
to a dyno I'm going to have this thing
on<00:04:54.850> the<00:04:54.940> dyno<00:04:55.180> I'm<00:04:55.450> going<00:04:55.690> to<00:04:55.750> break<00:04:55.960> it<00:04:56.080> in<00:04:56.200> on

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
on the dyno I'm going to break it in on

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.500 
on the dyno I'm going to break it in on
the<00:04:56.500> dyno<00:04:56.710> and<00:04:57.040> then<00:04:57.910> I'm<00:04:58.060> going<00:04:58.270> to<00:04:58.330> pull<00:04:58.480> it

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
the dyno and then I'm going to pull it

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.000 
the dyno and then I'm going to pull it
on<00:04:58.750> the<00:04:58.780> dyno<00:04:59.080> we're<00:04:59.380> going<00:04:59.500> to<00:04:59.590> see<00:04:59.710> what<00:04:59.890> we

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010 
on the dyno we're going to see what we

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:04.350 
on the dyno we're going to see what we
get<00:05:00.160> out<00:05:00.310> of<00:05:00.340> it<00:05:02.070> the<00:05:03.070> governor<00:05:03.490> so<00:05:03.670> far<00:05:03.940> stock

get out of it the governor so far stock

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.970 
get out of it the governor so far stock
I'm<00:05:04.750> running<00:05:06.510> right<00:05:07.510> now<00:05:07.660> it's<00:05:07.810> at<00:05:07.930> 1,500<00:05:08.590> rpms

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980

I'm<00:05:09.190> going<00:05:09.340> to<00:05:09.400> change<00:05:09.640> a<00:05:09.760> little<00:05:09.880> bit<00:05:10.120> I<00:05:10.180> want

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
I'm going to change a little bit I want

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.100 
I'm going to change a little bit I want
to<00:05:10.480> be<00:05:10.630> in<00:05:10.720> that<00:05:10.870> 1800<00:05:11.350> mark<00:05:12.570> that's<00:05:13.570> that's

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
to be in that 1800 mark that's that's

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.990 
to be in that 1800 mark that's that's
optimum<00:05:14.920> for<00:05:15.160> the<00:05:15.220> way<00:05:15.340> things<00:05:15.610> that<00:05:15.850> we're

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
optimum for the way things that we're

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.080 
optimum for the way things that we're
set<00:05:16.210> up<00:05:16.240> here<00:05:16.360> but<00:05:17.460> this<00:05:18.460> is<00:05:18.580> my<00:05:18.670> first<00:05:18.880> time

set up here but this is my first time

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.850 
set up here but this is my first time
really<00:05:19.300> diving<00:05:19.600> into<00:05:19.810> tracker<00:05:20.260> so<00:05:20.590> anybody

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
really diving into tracker so anybody

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:21.420 
really diving into tracker so anybody
can<00:05:21.130> do<00:05:21.250> it

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
can do it

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.540 
can do it
I<00:05:21.610> got<00:05:22.270> a<00:05:22.300> manual<00:05:22.690> from<00:05:22.930> the<00:05:23.020> service<00:05:23.440> manual
