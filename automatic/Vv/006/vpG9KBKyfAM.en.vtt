00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
know pretty much same strategy I guess

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.400 
know pretty much same strategy I guess
he'll<00:01:02.100> just<00:01:02.130> have<00:01:02.520> more<00:01:03.420> help<00:01:03.630> this<00:01:03.900> time<00:01:04.170> and

a<00:01:04.440> couple<00:01:04.620> more<00:01:04.860> minions<00:01:05.129> but<00:01:09.620> basically<00:01:10.620> he

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
a couple more minions but basically he

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.310 
a couple more minions but basically he
should<00:01:11.190> still<00:01:11.460> be<00:01:11.660> me<00:01:12.660> pretty<00:01:12.869> much<00:01:13.020> same

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
should still be me pretty much same

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.859 
should still be me pretty much same
concept

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
concept

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.820 
concept

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.770 

excellent<00:01:32.970> so<00:01:33.090> we're<00:01:33.210> working<00:01:33.479> through<00:01:33.570> his

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
excellent so we're working through his

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.330 
excellent so we're working through his
first<00:01:33.960> day<00:01:34.200> just<00:01:34.409> pretty<00:01:34.620> quickly<00:01:34.860> right<00:01:35.130> now

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
first day just pretty quickly right now

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.360 
first day just pretty quickly right now
and<00:01:36.030> that's<00:01:36.120> good<00:01:36.360> stuff

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.370 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.410 

excellent<00:01:41.370> so<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.490> didn't<00:01:41.850> manage<00:01:41.940> to<00:01:42.210> avoid

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
excellent so I didn't manage to avoid

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:51.880 
excellent so I didn't manage to avoid
that<00:01:42.660> ring<00:01:42.900> of<00:01:43.020> death<00:01:43.229> which<00:01:43.800> is<00:01:43.950> good

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.850 

excellent<00:01:52.850> so<00:01:53.210> we've<00:01:53.420> doubled<00:01:53.630> him<00:01:53.960> I<00:01:56.830> want<00:01:57.830> to

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
excellent so we've doubled him I want to

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.300 
excellent so we've doubled him I want to
deal<00:01:58.040> with<00:01:58.160> you<00:01:58.340> guys<00:01:59.800> but<00:02:00.800> I<00:02:00.830> wasn't<00:02:01.070> paying

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
deal with you guys but I wasn't paying

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.020 
deal with you guys but I wasn't paying
attention<00:02:01.460> and<00:02:01.940> I<00:02:02.710> got<00:02:03.710> a<00:02:03.740> ringing<00:02:04.040> death<00:02:04.190> that

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
attention and I got a ringing death that

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.880 
attention and I got a ringing death that
was<00:02:05.120> kind<00:02:05.270> of<00:02:05.300> dumb

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
was kind of dumb

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.190 
was kind of dumb
that's<00:02:07.430> all<00:02:07.610> right<00:02:07.730> though<00:02:07.970> because<00:02:08.960> now<00:02:09.140> we

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
that's all right though because now we

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.150 
that's all right though because now we
took<00:02:09.440> him<00:02:09.650> out

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
took him out

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.150 
took him out
excellent<00:02:11.150> so<00:02:11.420> I<00:02:11.750> think<00:02:11.900> that<00:02:12.410> Roy<00:02:12.620> shields

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
excellent so I think that Roy shields

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.620 
excellent so I think that Roy shields
will<00:02:13.280> probably<00:02:13.880> need<00:02:14.060> nerf<00:02:15.910> it<00:02:16.910> just<00:02:17.270> only

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
will probably need nerf it just only

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.150 
will probably need nerf it just only
seems<00:02:18.220> likely<00:02:20.410> because<00:02:21.410> right<00:02:21.740> now<00:02:21.920> they<00:02:22.130> are

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
seems likely because right now they are

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.090 
seems likely because right now they are
just<00:02:22.280> so<00:02:23.030> massively<00:02:23.540> overpowered<00:02:24.290> it's<00:02:24.950> a

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
just so massively overpowered it's a

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.680 
just so massively overpowered it's a
little<00:02:25.430> bit<00:02:25.550> ridiculous

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.760 

try<00:02:29.690> to<00:02:29.750> get<00:02:29.900> a<00:02:29.930> little<00:02:30.140> bit<00:02:30.290> of<00:02:30.410> my<00:02:30.530> health

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
try to get a little bit of my health

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:38.559 
try to get a little bit of my health
back<00:02:31.010> here

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.610 

excellent<00:02:41.629> so<00:02:42.629> now<00:02:42.660> we're<00:02:43.080> going<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.440> fight

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
excellent so now we're going to fight

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.259 
excellent so now we're going to fight
the<00:02:43.860> headed<00:02:44.610> version<00:02:45.000> of<00:02:45.120> him<00:02:45.360> here<00:02:45.690> a<00:02:47.269> little

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
and we completed a challenge I think

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.370 
and we completed a challenge I think
with<00:03:45.580> the<00:03:45.670> storm<00:03:45.940> front<00:03:46.150> there<00:03:46.390> so<00:03:47.080> that<00:03:47.230> was

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
with the storm front there so that was

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.070 
with the storm front there so that was
neat<00:03:47.590> and<00:03:48.100> now<00:03:48.760> we<00:03:48.819> just<00:03:49.090> have<00:03:49.330> a<00:03:51.840> few<00:03:52.840> more<00:03:53.020> of

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
notable roy shields the big thumper and

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.770 
notable roy shields the big thumper and
avalanche<00:04:52.680> the<00:04:52.920> Avalanche<00:04:53.400> is<00:04:53.610> pretty<00:04:54.540> close

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
avalanche the Avalanche is pretty close

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.570 
avalanche the Avalanche is pretty close
to<00:04:55.080> his<00:04:55.200> over<00:04:55.440> powered<00:04:55.740> as<00:04:55.890> the<00:04:56.070> shooting<00:04:56.370> star

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
to his over powered as the shooting star

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.820 
to his over powered as the shooting star
I'd<00:04:56.730> say<00:04:56.970> it<00:04:57.540> has<00:04:57.570> more<00:04:57.930> special<00:04:58.290> effects<00:04:58.560> and

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
I'd say it has more special effects and

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.710 
I'd say it has more special effects and
just<00:05:01.830> less<00:05:02.070> roid<00:05:02.370> damage<00:05:02.820> and<00:05:03.030> the<00:05:03.540> big

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
just less roid damage and the big

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.750 
just less roid damage and the big
thumper<00:05:04.110> is<00:05:04.320> just<00:05:04.590> kind<00:05:04.770> of<00:05:04.830> stupid<00:05:05.100> it<00:05:05.490> just

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
thumper is just kind of stupid it just

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.670 
thumper is just kind of stupid it just
does<00:05:06.240> damage<00:05:06.510> to<00:05:06.870> you<00:05:06.960> after<00:05:07.290> your<00:05:07.440> shield

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
does damage to you after your shield

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.460 
does damage to you after your shield
recharges<00:05:08.280> and<00:05:08.310> has<00:05:08.930> significantly<00:05:09.930> less<00:05:10.020> ROI

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
recharges and has significantly less ROI

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.170 
recharges and has significantly less ROI
damage<00:05:10.890> than<00:05:11.100> the<00:05:11.190> shooting<00:05:11.490> star<00:05:11.730> so<00:05:11.940> I'm<00:05:12.060> not

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
damage than the shooting star so I'm not

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.700 
damage than the shooting star so I'm not
really<00:05:12.390> sure<00:05:12.660> what<00:05:12.840> the<00:05:12.960> point<00:05:12.990> of<00:05:13.410> the<00:05:13.530> big

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
really sure what the point of the big

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.290 
really sure what the point of the big
thumper<00:05:14.070> is<00:05:14.190> maybe<00:05:14.520> I'm<00:05:14.700> missing<00:05:15.090> something

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
thumper is maybe I'm missing something

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.180 
thumper is maybe I'm missing something
further<00:05:16.050> testing<00:05:16.530> will<00:05:16.650> let<00:05:16.800> me<00:05:16.890> know<00:05:17.010> for
