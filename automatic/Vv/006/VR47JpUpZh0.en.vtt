00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:34.870
 hello people stay here and spokesman 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:38.960
 I want to talk to you today about vertical 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:42.290
 of course, and that's what I'm considering 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.870
 Do not advertise any weapon yet 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.550
 to everyone but most weapons 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.510
 I liked something about myself 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.820
 have to say 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.970
 make a video how to use them 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.059
 should and so on I have just now 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.379
 what are the clips exchanged 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.290
 bit it comes to in other's 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.519
 not bad 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.640
 so yes today I would like first of all 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:06.860
 that will be solo series I said and 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.159
 I talk me first about the s2000 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.860
 because she is not damned 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:17.380
 strong 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:20.270
 I have to say that really everybody 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:25.070
 everything travels almost the same stats 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:28.070
 did not think so only only 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.960
 the shots per second so how fast 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.270
 let's shoot with the weapon 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.920
 quite different but there are 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.900
 no are no statistics for up 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.220
 So now I have weapons statistics 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:42.159
 found where it says the action fell so 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:44.479
 But that does not shoot them so fast 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.610
 he is a few clips that I will 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.140
 always do so or maybe some 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.229
 simple squad deathmatch where upload 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.430
 I'm pretty good with the weapon 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.780
 actually better than there you can see how 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.530
 the weapon on long range is like that 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.330
 weapon short range is so I have 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.000
 At the beginning I had a clip 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.210
 always do such a clip at the beginning that one 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.680
 because i see how i do awesome thing or 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.649
 maybe not with this team play 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.540
 is and so on tell me then 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:17.299
 always inferior with music 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:21.980
 I do it shortly in 2000 with scope laser 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:25.780
 and the handle grabbed the clips here 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.519
 are often highway and on german metro 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.620
 and yes the fc did somehow feel like 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:33.560
 such a spray weapon but I mean 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.380
 Of course you can not do it on long range 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.530
 but weapons speak 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.170
 I have the feeling that the recall 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.640
 that's the break 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.550
 hit the third and fourth ball 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:50.560
 but not that's all the same because the spray 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:54.730
 occurs the fourth fifth or sixth 15th 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:57.100
 46 and yes that's faster than you will 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.040
 celebrate that crosshair again 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.300
 So the goal is I've got it here 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.830
 written down the damage 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.880
 I'll probably be there too 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.650
 still somewhere in on screen write 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:13.540
 So from 1 to 10 meters she has 25 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:17.020
 damage with four balls 15 meters 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.270
 So up to 15 meters 24 damage done 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:23.020
 comes later on media or no 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:29.350
 but most of the time is still 44 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:35.140
 google on 20 meters only 21 on 25 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:38.290
 mhz 20 damage to 35 20 times 40 meters only 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:43.150
 19 damage and that is almost at 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:45.640
 all weapons like that and you could get the 2000 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.080
 still with flashlight use as a shit 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.510
 dream since I do not take it that exciting 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.330
 I said so in the beginning 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.890
 Oh, come on, I'm so far that's it 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.590
 not at all but meanwhile sees 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.060
 just think that is not anymore 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.650
 to be done with the patch that is 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.040
 already well hidden but my opponent 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.720
 Nevertheless, it does not look so yes 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.760
 I'll shoot in there 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.959
 and the opposite of the stress on the side and 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.790
 shoots at the same time you are even 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.630
 no chance but as I said 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:22.750
 the tips are a bit 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:24.850
 got mixed up that is easy 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.540
 Everything you have to shoot shines 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.070
 green 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:31.320
 Oh yes, here are the great songs on the 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.320
 highway of it still a foul and behind it 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:41.500
 very funny what goes you see her 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.490
 me totally dead on short distance i 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.410
 my 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.569
 But you do with others too 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.539
 again great the highways poncho 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:52.030
 dirt behind me I want the same old 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:55.710
 I'm still up the stairs 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:05:02.680
 have cut in yes and that was yours 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:04.300
 McQuaid is so wonderful year 2000 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.250
 in my opinion a very very 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.490
 Strong weapon here you can still see 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.150
 But not in mid range 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.699
 fast dead 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.050
 especially with the interrail scope 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:16.360
 write on me again the comments 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.949
 what I still have about which weapons 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.409
 this was just an initial video 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:21.599
 because I will do nothing about anything 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:26.199
 say more 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:27.550
 and yes I'll just look in 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:29.409
 the comments which weapons I make 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:34.199
 to 1 490 was suggested to me once 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:36.729
 I will do that too and many 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:38.710
 and see you next time i hope you 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:41.770
 liked it when you see more 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:44.650
 So want weapons and so 8 and me 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:46.440
 wanted to bankrupt for how to 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.710
 the round best wins 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.870
 strategies 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.580
 therefore run into the head count on this 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.590
 map soundso use these two 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.330
 to protect flanks 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.830
 So if you want to see something like that 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.680
 I subscribed somewhere in the 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:02.400
 description or on the screen should 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:05.830
 you can now click somewhere with it 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:08.139
 yes to the other videos comes if you that 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:10.690
 want and yes if you want to see weapons 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:13.979
 subscribed to strategies for more and now 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.979
