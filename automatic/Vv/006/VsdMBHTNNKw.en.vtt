00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 i got the a &amp; g at â€‹â€‹gamescom 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.970
 cities carl lantz looked at after dark 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.980
 eyes and how the name might be 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.660
 recognizes gesture mainly about something 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.769
 the fans have long wanted 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.990
 but have somehow impossible 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.389
 held on technically one day 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.800
 night cycle as there is now 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.460
 actually a day change in the night 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.529
 game 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.970
 the non-host funnily enough with the 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.800
 add-on built but with a 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.180
 free patch of about 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.010
 otherwise speaking at the same time 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.260
 this day after cycle is there for everyone 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.970
 you can use it really meaningfully 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.070
 But then you just the main one 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.260
 Change has certain things 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.660
 adds that especially for the for 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.430
 namely meaningful are under 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.590
 other that pleasure itself 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.719
 business district so commercial areas 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.820
 specialize in pleasure now 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.950
 can and at night it is driving so 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.660
 besides, fewer people go to work 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.100
 instead, then just somewhere has to 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.870
 I can have fun, for example 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.550
 casino with somehow nice flashing 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.440
 neon lamps and so on and so forth 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.960
 or to the beach, there is now 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.340
 also pleasure building the on the beach 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.649
 can stand there then arise 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.210
 example marinas or beaches where 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.220
 people go swimming or somehow 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.780
 boat landing jetski jetties 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.890
 and so on and so on what then too 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.150
 cause it to be water 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.680
 becomes more popular because then no 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.409
 boats jetskis are traveling 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.900
 The transport system is also changed 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.689
 through this day after cycle for now 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.549
 the game determines, so to speak, the game 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.020
 priorities of the inhabitants to one 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.869
 certain time of day that says so 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.790
 During the day, more people tend to drive 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.799
 going to work at night tends to be 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.930
 more people in the entertainment district 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.820
 Overall, but at night then less 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.930
 what would be traffic on the street? 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.520
 it leads to that for example then 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.869
 It will also be fast 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.610
 Game system and the game feeling 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.110
 to change it a lot 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.700
 looking forward to how that affects 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.930
 and that was not all that was after 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.729
 So tag brings the change 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.890
 That's because new types of buildings will be added 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.240
 give and combined building types 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.369
 for example what you showed us 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.200
 was a international airport of 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.340
 not just just a major airport 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.100
 but at the same time already one 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.820
 built-in subway station has or it 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.650
 are now prisons 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.060
 the criminals be put forward 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.220
 after being on the police 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.900
 were somehow doctored 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.070
 I say 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.630
 and there are others so composed as well 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.280
 building for example at the bus station wo 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.110
 simply several bus lines converge 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.970
 and the people can change easier 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.320
 and even killings with the parents 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.850
 then have the possibility so 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.110
 to build combined buildings that will 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.880
 then much easier with the mod 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.680
 tools but also to do it yourself 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.510
 can think like for example none 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.770
 Knowing a combined police and 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.420
 Fire station so that should be too 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.040
 can also become easier or 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.500
 when the day after cycles come in 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.209
 also night versions of their buildings then 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.650
 Overall, I think that's true 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.970
 ne cool thing because it is actually what 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.959
 I thought that would come from 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.459
 then never ever clean 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.080
 they just build new houses 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.120
 One selling graphics is then for 20 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.100
 euro is not really that and she is 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.060
 say new buildings models and so that 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.860
 if we bring then at most 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.120
 get out for free the modders do that 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.500
 also for free we do not want that 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.720
 make money if we have something new 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.190
 Install are new features and these 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.570
 day after story are ever after 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.570
 our cool feature
