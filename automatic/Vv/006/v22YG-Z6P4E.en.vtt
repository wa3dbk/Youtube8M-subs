00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.930 

I<00:00:11.230> don't<00:00:12.230> really<00:00:12.320> believe<00:00:12.709> in<00:00:12.980> history<00:00:13.400> so

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:13.940 
I don't really believe in history so

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.669 
I don't really believe in history so
it's<00:00:14.420> difficult<00:00:14.629> to<00:00:14.840> break<00:00:15.110> with<00:00:15.320> history<00:00:15.619> if

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:15.679 
it's difficult to break with history if

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:19.510 
it's difficult to break with history if
you<00:00:15.740> don't<00:00:15.889> believe<00:00:16.039> in<00:00:16.520> history<00:00:17.830> I'm<00:00:18.830> not<00:00:19.160> any

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
you don't believe in history I'm not any

you don't believe in history I'm not any
kind<00:00:19.669> of<00:00:19.939> expert<00:00:20.480> on<00:00:20.630> anything<00:00:20.930> in<00:00:21.619> terms<00:00:21.829> of

kind of expert on anything in terms of

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.420 
kind of expert on anything in terms of
historical<00:00:22.880> sources<00:00:23.599> but<00:00:24.439> I'm<00:00:24.680> interested<00:00:24.980> in

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
historical sources but I'm interested in

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.450 
historical sources but I'm interested in
it<00:00:25.610> and<00:00:25.849> I<00:00:25.969> do<00:00:26.029> feel<00:00:26.710> that<00:00:27.710> I<00:00:27.770> have<00:00:28.009> permission

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
it and I do feel that I have permission

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.770 
it and I do feel that I have permission
at<00:00:28.820> some<00:00:29.059> level<00:00:29.390> to<00:00:29.649> play<00:00:30.649> with<00:00:30.919> it<00:00:31.780> one

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
at some level to play with it one

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.770 
at some level to play with it one
subject<00:00:33.230> of<00:00:33.590> some<00:00:33.829> of<00:00:33.920> my<00:00:34.070> work<00:00:34.309> is<00:00:34.670> the<00:00:35.059> fact

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
subject of some of my work is the fact

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.900 
subject of some of my work is the fact
that<00:00:35.930> history<00:00:36.410> is<00:00:36.620> mutable<00:00:37.040> which<00:00:37.399> is

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
that history is mutable which is

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.150 
that history is mutable which is
essentially<00:00:38.719> denying<00:00:39.200> history<00:00:39.739> so<00:00:39.950> either

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
essentially denying history so either

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.830 
essentially denying history so either
you<00:00:40.399> can<00:00:40.430> believe<00:00:40.730> there<00:00:41.120> is<00:00:41.360> this<00:00:41.629> thing

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
you can believe there is this thing

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.200 
you can believe there is this thing
called<00:00:42.020> history<00:00:42.500> which<00:00:42.740> is<00:00:43.040> in<00:00:43.550> some<00:00:43.910> general

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
called history which is in some general

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.000 
called history which is in some general
sense<00:00:44.540> a<00:00:44.720> linear<00:00:45.020> narrative<00:00:45.320> with<00:00:45.800> a

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
sense a linear narrative with a

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.300 
sense a linear narrative with a
definable<00:00:46.579> kind<00:00:47.570> of<00:00:47.690> thrust<00:00:48.200> to<00:00:48.350> it<00:00:48.560> or<00:00:49.100> you

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:49.310 
definable kind of thrust to it or you

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.490 
definable kind of thrust to it or you
could<00:00:49.430> say<00:00:49.640> that<00:00:49.970> there's<00:00:50.480> just<00:00:50.960> a<00:00:51.170> lot<00:00:51.350> of

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
could say that there's just a lot of

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.880 
could say that there's just a lot of
different<00:00:52.040> kind<00:00:52.310> of<00:00:52.489> stories<00:00:53.360> and<00:00:53.690> so<00:00:54.620> if<00:00:54.739> you

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
different kind of stories and so if you

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.130 
different kind of stories and so if you
believe<00:00:55.250> that<00:00:55.370> then<00:00:56.270> you<00:00:56.390> can't<00:00:56.630> really<00:00:56.690> break

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
believe that then you can't really break

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.020 
believe that then you can't really break
with<00:00:57.380> them<00:00:57.530> you<00:00:57.680> could<00:00:57.860> only<00:00:58.010> reassemble<00:00:58.850> them

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
with them you could only reassemble them

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.630 
with them you could only reassemble them
in<00:00:59.210> some<00:00:59.420> other<00:00:59.630> way<00:00:59.899> possibly<00:01:00.680> or<00:01:00.950> you<00:01:01.399> could

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
in some other way possibly or you could

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:10.590 
in some other way possibly or you could
add<00:01:01.850> your<00:01:01.880> own

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.400 

art<00:01:11.260> is<00:01:11.440> essentially<00:01:12.010> a<00:01:12.600> physical<00:01:13.600> remnant<00:01:14.200> of

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
art is essentially a physical remnant of

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.840 
art is essentially a physical remnant of
a<00:01:15.310> moment<00:01:15.790> in<00:01:16.060> a<00:01:16.180> way<00:01:16.330> and<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:17.830> can<00:01:18.040> never<00:01:18.370> know

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
a moment in a way and you can never know

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.270 
a moment in a way and you can never know
anymore<00:01:19.660> what<00:01:19.930> that<00:01:20.290> moment<00:01:20.560> was<00:01:20.800> all<00:01:21.130> you

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
anymore what that moment was all you

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.670 
anymore what that moment was all you
have<00:01:21.460> this<00:01:21.790> thing<00:01:22.330> that<00:01:22.660> you<00:01:22.870> have<00:01:23.050> to<00:01:23.200> in<00:01:23.350> some

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
have this thing that you have to in some

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.130 
have this thing that you have to in some
level<00:01:24.070> reinvent<00:01:24.850> for<00:01:25.060> yourself<00:01:25.480> for<00:01:25.990> it<00:01:26.080> to

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
level reinvent for yourself for it to

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.220 
level reinvent for yourself for it to
have<00:01:26.230> any<00:01:26.410> meaning<00:01:27.630> we<00:01:28.630> don't<00:01:28.720> think<00:01:28.990> about

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:29.230 
have any meaning we don't think about

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.590 
have any meaning we don't think about
this<00:01:29.790> necessarily<00:01:30.790> that<00:01:31.000> often<00:01:31.330> but<00:01:31.450> when<00:01:31.540> you

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
this necessarily that often but when you

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.690 
this necessarily that often but when you
go<00:01:31.750> to<00:01:31.840> or<00:01:32.110> just<00:01:32.140> a<00:01:32.380> normal<00:01:32.830> Fine<00:01:33.460> Arts<00:01:33.670> Museum

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
go to or just a normal Fine Arts Museum

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.610 
go to or just a normal Fine Arts Museum
these<00:01:34.630> are<00:01:34.810> these<00:01:34.960> objects<00:01:35.470> that<00:01:35.500> are

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 
these are these objects that are

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.980 
these are these objects that are
completely<00:01:36.130> divorced<00:01:37.030> from<00:01:37.240> their<00:01:37.510> original

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
completely divorced from their original

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.790 
completely divorced from their original
intention<00:01:38.550> to<00:01:39.550> such<00:01:39.820> a<00:01:39.850> great<00:01:40.180> degree<00:01:40.390> that<00:01:41.080> in

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
intention to such a great degree that in

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.469 
intention to such a great degree that in
a<00:01:41.950> certain<00:01:42.160> sense<00:01:42.280> they<00:01:42.670> have<00:01:42.820> nothing<00:01:43.000> to<00:01:43.330> do

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
a certain sense they have nothing to do

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.690 
a certain sense they have nothing to do
with<00:01:43.660> their<00:01:43.900> history<00:01:44.500> they<00:01:44.979> we've<00:01:45.220> destroyed

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
with their history they we've destroyed

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.520 
with their history they we've destroyed
the<00:01:45.940> history<00:01:46.300> quite<00:01:46.479> literally<00:01:46.960> like<00:01:47.110> to<00:01:47.290> rip

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
the history quite literally like to rip

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.340 
the history quite literally like to rip
out<00:01:47.800> an<00:01:48.160> altarpiece<00:01:48.820> from<00:01:49.270> a<00:01:49.420> church<00:01:49.720> and<00:01:50.050> to

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
out an altarpiece from a church and to

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.969 
out an altarpiece from a church and to
put<00:01:50.530> in<00:01:50.650> a<00:01:50.800> museum<00:01:51.220> is<00:01:51.759> to<00:01:52.320> very<00:01:53.320> violently

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
put in a museum is to very violently

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.499 
put in a museum is to very violently
deny<00:01:54.520> its<00:01:55.330> history<00:01:55.840> and<00:01:56.170> its<00:01:56.830> meaning<00:01:57.509> but

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
deny its history and its meaning but

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.690 
deny its history and its meaning but
what's<00:01:58.750> amazing<00:01:59.020> is<00:01:59.470> is<00:01:59.770> that<00:02:00.070> the<00:02:00.220> objects

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
what's amazing is is that the objects

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.930 
what's amazing is is that the objects
still<00:02:01.060> have<00:02:01.330> power<00:02:01.990> anyway<00:02:02.680> so<00:02:03.220> they<00:02:03.400> contain

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
still have power anyway so they contain

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.590 
still have power anyway so they contain
in<00:02:04.360> their<00:02:04.710> physical<00:02:05.710> nature<00:02:06.240> another<00:02:07.240> kind<00:02:07.540> of

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
in their physical nature another kind of

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.260 
in their physical nature another kind of
history<00:02:07.960> and<00:02:08.259> then<00:02:09.100> you<00:02:09.280> can<00:02:09.520> reinvent<00:02:10.030> that

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
history and then you can reinvent that

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.750 
history and then you can reinvent that
for<00:02:10.450> yourself<00:02:13.320> so<00:02:14.320> in<00:02:14.560> that<00:02:14.709> sense<00:02:15.070> I<00:02:15.310> think<00:02:15.580> as

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
for yourself so in that sense I think as

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.520 
for yourself so in that sense I think as
an<00:02:15.910> artisan<00:02:16.239> I'm<00:02:16.570> interested<00:02:17.080> in<00:02:17.140> this<00:02:17.260> very

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
an artisan I'm interested in this very

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.710 
an artisan I'm interested in this very
thing<00:02:17.830> about<00:02:18.040> how<00:02:18.250> art<00:02:18.550> works<00:02:18.910> in<00:02:19.150> that<00:02:19.300> way

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
thing about how art works in that way

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.910 
thing about how art works in that way
that<00:02:20.260> art<00:02:20.650> is<00:02:21.450> has<00:02:22.450> lots<00:02:22.750> of<00:02:22.840> ideas<00:02:22.989> behind<00:02:23.650> it

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
that art is has lots of ideas behind it

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.940 
that art is has lots of ideas behind it
and<00:02:24.070> they<00:02:24.489> somehow<00:02:24.820> get<00:02:25.150> embedded<00:02:25.830> into<00:02:26.830> the
