00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.870
 good morning to all what easy 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.540
 happy precisely kong 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:14.340
 today we live as and why do the 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.740
 valid wash your mother in to eat 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.789
 an operation that applies the yeast 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:24.539
 when we feel that it is too acid ie 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.810
 to a very pungent smell or see 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.990
 that the prost is very dark or we can 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.110
 even think about that during the 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.469
 manipulation at some point in the del 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:43.770
 its development may have been 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:46.230
 small environmental contamination yes 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.600
 proceeds in this world 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:56.910
 we take a liter of water and the over 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:01:02.579
 we are in a basin we add a g 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:15.080
 More or less sugar g sugar is 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:15.080
 a teaspoon expose Satin Coffee 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:31.179
 and then we take our limit from the 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:31.179
 we remove the coast 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.960
 later we expect it this way 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:48.780
 trying to take only a part 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.780
 central of the yeast 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:05.050
 here once we sliced ​​it 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:09.450
 we weigh our dough we have the 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:18.519
 heart of the cake of 200 grams 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:23.920
 we believe in thin slices in this e 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:30.930
 put the slices in the water 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:34.470
 sweet, let it soak for 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.470
 15 20 minutes 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:46.350
 about 20 minutes have passed 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:46.350
 now let's take up our leaven 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:54.730
 logo we pull out of the sugar water 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:57.120
 we squeeze it slightly we put it in 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.120
 a bowl 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.330
 when we have recovered all the 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:40.360
 leaven let us proceed with refreshment for 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:44.040
 the refreshment that follows the washing of 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:48.220
 there are particular doses of yeast 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:54.849
 which are different for the fresh ones during 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:58.720
 fermentation takes 150 per 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:04:00.940
 hundred of yeast in flour even more 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.209
 a 10 percent 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.349
 so since our cake was from 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:09.160
 200 grams 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:16.060
 we will take 300 g of flour plus 20 grams 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:20.680
 in total 320 grams of flour and 50 per 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.990
 one hundred of the flour reached then 150 g 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:26.320
 of water 

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:31.240
 we will proceed in this way we add 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:33.610
 water our washed yeast and the 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.090
 we manipulate until we get a small one 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.090
 cream 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.740
 to the cream we add a flour 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:16.819
 we work until we get a dough 

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:16.819
 smooth and homogeneous 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:59.490
 when you get a smooth dough 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:06:03.230
 and homogeneous put it back on nerve cover 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:09.870
 with the napkin and let it ferment 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:12.540
 for the usual 24 hours other news on 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:15.470
 yeast on conservation on 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:17.940
 fermentation are available on the site 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:22.520
 home easy happy indeed 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.520
 see you next recipe
