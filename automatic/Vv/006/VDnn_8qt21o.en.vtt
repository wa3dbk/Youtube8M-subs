00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.520
What's up?

00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:01.280
Everything alrighty?

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:04.180
We're starting a new monthly series!

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.740
The Tolarian Academy!

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.840
A show that will tell more about the history of Magic

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.160
Stuff about the game itself and also about the universe of Magic the Gathering

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.100
Something we call Lore [we don't like it much]

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.860
And we have a big partnership!

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.180
The guys from Magic the Gathering History's page are giving us all support and material we need to make this show

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.200
Don't forget to take a look at their page, it's really good

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.900
Anyways, let's get to first episode of the series!

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.020
To start off we're talking about the history of the game, Magic, itself

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.220
Where did it come from?

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.400
Who developed the game?

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.040
When did they decide it was a good idea to create a game such as Magic?

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.500
It all starts witha guy named Richard Garfield

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.760
Mr Garfield was, until then, a  [lasagna eater] a probability teacher

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.420
But it was a man that really enjoyed board games and games in general

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.780
He, then, has an idea for a new board game

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.860
 and goes up to this new company Wizards of the Coast with his idea

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.020
Why, Good Afternoon,

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.580
(Good afternoon) How are ya?

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:49.480
Richard Garfield

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.560
Mr. Garfield,

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.820
So, I had an idea for a new board game

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.660
It works like that:

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.780
It's about giant robots that race inside an abandoned facility

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.500
I call it... Robo Rally

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:03.580
What?

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:04.080
Yup,

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.900
this was his idea

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.620
A board game about crazy robots making cool races [I'd buy it]

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.400
The guys from Wizard even thought it was rad, but it would be too expansive to produce

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.400
Richard Garfield was going to leave empty handed

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.880
But then they asked if he hadn't other idea for a game

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.040
And he had

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.820
So?

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.820
Yeah, Mr Garfield, we're not interested

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.740
(It's okay) But wouldn't you have any idea for some other game?

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.200
These days [bout a week ago] I had an idea for a card game about 2 mages the fight in the multiverse,

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.480
Using the cosmos energy, with 5 colors of Magic, and they summon creatures

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:34.560
And use mana!

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.860
To cast their spells

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.200
But it's a very simple idea, with not much strategy, just a normal card game

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.060
[Sucess Grab]

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.100
I see profit

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.600
We can sell it in boosters

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.720
Fat packs, BOXES

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.020
Initially, he thought the guys from Wizard would not fancy it

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.300
But they loved it

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.100
In 1993, Magic the Gathering was oficially released

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.200
And the answer was very positive

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.820
Alright man, I'll use a Bolt on that creature on the corner

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.980
Hey bro, what game is this?

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.660
It's Magic the Gathering,it's really cool

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.260
Do you know it

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.840
No ["I do, just asked cause reasons"]

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.720
It works like that: you cast terrains, generate mana with them,

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.060
You summon creatures and use your creatures to hit the enemy

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.380
However dies first, loses the game

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.040
Oh nice, it seems simple and fun

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.600
Yeah, it's real nice, wanna play?

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.940
Dude,

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.780
Is there a deck that can control which cards enters, which one leaves, flip cards up, draw more cards

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.820
Yes there is, you draw more cards, you decide what enters and what doesn't

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.960
Fellas get really mad about it

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:24.940
Yes, finally

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.940
They made decks for Sons of Bitches like me

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.480
Of course the game's success was way beyond the cards alone

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.280
The game was really balanced and dynamic [except for control blue, then it was dull]

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.280
Probably because of Richar-ss Hadarv-

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.400
Gritchar, gritchar,Gritchard Hardveild

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.800
[Please standy by as we make a quick maintence on Roxo]

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.900
Probablye because of Richard Garfield's formation [lasgna eater?]

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.780
The dude has a PhD in Combinatorics Math on pennsylvania's University

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.020
P-H-D BRO

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.140
Richard Garfield, man, let me compliment on your game, it's REALLy balanced

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.040
Congratulations man,

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.940
Yeah, it's mathematically semi-perfect

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.320
Like human life

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.320
In numbers

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.320
[Math: Not even once]

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.260
He's so borin

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.260
You said something?

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.900
Anyways

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.800
The game's alpha version sold 10 million cards, expanding Wizards of the Coast

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.100
But the cool part is how the first Magic ed. was released

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.620
In a small store in GenCon, the Alpha cards were sold in small amounts and only as curiosities

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.780
Man, that's so cool, what game is this?

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.420
These are the cards of a new game called Magic the Gathering

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.160
Oh nice,

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.020
[At this moment, he was already addicted]

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.960
How much does each cost?

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:23.820
1 dollar

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.440
Wicked, Can you get me

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.360
3 black lotus, please

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.300
Thanks man,

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.980
Congratulations man, the game seems to be really groovy

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.240
Thanks, thanks for your fatih in us [At this point, there's no coming back]

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:34.880
Well, actually, give me one of each, will ya?

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.400
And like that, a millionaire is born

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.820
And then Magic BOOM'ed

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.320
They were forced to print out Beta, that was more alpha cards and some extra ones for collection

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.020
The games succes lead the to publishing of Unlimited and Arabian Knights

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.080
A set created really swiftly and also made by Richard Garfield

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.460
A succesful set to this day

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.380
Moshi-Moshi!

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.120
Why hello, Richard Garfield?

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.160
Yeah, it's me

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.600
Hey, it's Wizards of the Coast owner, how are you?

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.560
Oh he- Great, I'm fine aswell, here's the deal:

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.800
Magic the gathering was a success, man

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.420
We sold alpha, we sold beta, we're on fire!

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.040
Oh that's great news

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.380
Here's the thing: I need a new set due to tomorrow

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.320
Okay?

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.960
Alright, nice!

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.100
XOXO man

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.320
Daddy, daddy?

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.120
Come read this book with me

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.980
1001 nights?

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.280
And then, Magic set off

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.120
The sells were explosive, and Wizards of the Coast was already the biggest is their department

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.780
And, with time, Magic became what we know today

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.000
Hey man! Let's make the plays tonight?

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.120
Yeah, throw some cards

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.020
Hey, did you see the deck that won the Pro Tour?

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.640
No I haven't

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:49.600
It won on turn 2

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.320
[Much Strategy]

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.820
Turn 2?

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:51.340
[Many responsive]

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.840
Yeah...

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.380
[Very counterplay]

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.260
Slightly broken, uh?

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.660
Dynamic

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.140
Magic left a man's head the get on top of many payers table

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.980
If you could project a Magic set, how would it be?

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.980
Have a nice week, and nice rolls
