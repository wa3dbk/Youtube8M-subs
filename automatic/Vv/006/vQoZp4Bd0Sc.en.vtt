00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.550
 before his fifth game against the 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:10.410
 athletic of madrid- as a technician 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.410
 We have a nice knit bracelet 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:20.369
 real madrid and if people think it is 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:23.820
 easy, they 'll win even easier 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.779
 them tomorrow 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.779
 the nerves 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.669
 and a first derby that I've played 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.800
 It has been a 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.180
 125 sporting will come in from the 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.829
 benfica 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.890
 I said it was horrible 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:45.679
 it was very badly classified would make change 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.540
 the coach a couple of weeks before and 

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:50.210
 I was very bad 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.610
 the sporting was the daily champion of 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.650
 team that was in first and that was 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.660
 the strongest team 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.210
 they arrived there thinking that they were going to 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.730
 put 3 or 4 were wrong that we 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.230
 we have lied to him 3 and maybe tomorrow 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.020
 the same thing happened 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:09.490
 if people think we're going to get 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.840
 three or four and that tomorrow we are going to play 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.680
 with all the aspects that we are going to play 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.659
 against the zagreb dynamo, people 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.759
 wrong you less wrong than you have done well 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:23.990
 I'm an expert less bad that I have 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:26.750
 many years ready to know who 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.330
 Dervish interests me who is well 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.869
 who is wrong does not matter the tradition 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.860
 we are interested in interested statistic 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:41.070
 it's a match that you can 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.070
 in which everything can happen 10 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.549
 is for you to see how I think that the 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.950
 party is going to be difficult if I 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:52.680
 10 gifts 21 I accept 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.770
 like I said I never tire of repeating two 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:59.190
 fantastic players who are both 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.090
 in a state of form 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.219
 incredible too 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.100
 if they are two fantastic players but 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:09.269
 one is in very good shape and the other 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:12.380
 is at a less good time then there 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:15.140
 there is no kind of 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.140
 of doubt when the two are very good and 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.830
 they are both living a physical moment 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.280
 technical or psychological 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.110
 very good because it is true that you can 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.120
 create some kind of 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.910
 of doubt again the doubt that I want 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.560
 have is the positive doubt I did not want 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.080
 have the doubt of being in both very 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.580
 wrong and I have to opt for one of the 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.370
 two 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.670
 maybe I would have to go to the castle and 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:46.030
 the joselo forum for morata when they are 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.730
 The two stops are both very good 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.360
 can create a doubt but I'm glad 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.810
 have is 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.880
 this doubt 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.340
 I wonder if next season I 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.040
 I would like to see the centers in front of me 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.840
 would like to have 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.840
 higuain and we think
