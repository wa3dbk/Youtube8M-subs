00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.999 
what's really really a lot and I thought
it's<00:01:39.390> going<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.630> be<00:01:39.750> like<00:01:39.930> 700k<00:01:40.710> but<00:01:41.390> no<00:01:42.390> and

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
it's going to be like 700k but no and

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.499 
it's going to be like 700k but no and
then<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.189> course<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.640> started<00:01:44.850> getting<00:01:45.390> these

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
then of course I started getting these

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.060 
then of course I started getting these
 items<00:01:46.229> like<00:01:46.470> Adams<00:01:47.250> hood<00:01:47.520> 70k<00:01:49.070> Toric's

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
 items like Adams hood 70k Toric's

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.810

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
to get something better but at the end

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.609 
to get something better but at the end
everything<00:01:59.909> went<00:02:00.329> really<00:02:00.780> well<00:02:00.960> in<00:02:01.439> my

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
everything went really well in my

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.789 
everything went really well in my
opinion<00:02:01.770> I<00:02:02.280> got<00:02:02.490> 8<00:02:02.700> items<00:02:03.000> in<00:02:03.360> total<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:03.990> really

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
opinion I got 8 items in total I really

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.190 
opinion I got 8 items in total I really
can't<00:02:05.009> complain<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.700> total<00:02:06.090> value<00:02:06.540> was<00:02:06.899> I

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
can't complain the total value was I

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.020 
can't complain the total value was I
think<00:02:07.590> 7.4<00:02:08.580> million<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:09.349> I<00:02:10.349> spent<00:02:11.039> 1.4

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
think 7.4 million and I spent 1.4

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.820 
think 7.4 million and I spent 1.4
million<00:02:12.270> on<00:02:12.569> supplies<00:02:12.989> so<00:02:13.530> I

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
million on supplies so I

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.370 
million on supplies so I
use<00:02:13.920> around<00:02:14.250> 1k<00:02:14.700> sharks<00:02:15.150> as<00:02:15.330> I<00:02:15.540> was<00:02:15.750> not<00:02:15.960> using

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
it as well and a lot of times I would

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.030 
it as well and a lot of times I would
finish<00:02:29.340> it<00:02:29.490> even<00:02:30.030> faster<00:02:30.320> depending<00:02:31.320> if<00:02:31.710> I<00:02:31.860> was

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
finish it even faster depending if I was

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.520

money that's one of the reasons why I
started<00:02:51.060> doing<00:02:51.120> this<00:02:51.540> because<00:02:52.410> I<00:02:52.650> did<00:02:53.430> not

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
started doing this because I did not

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.760 
started doing this because I did not
have<00:02:53.820> enough<00:02:53.850> to<00:02:54.270> encompass<00:02:54.540> for<00:02:55.050> level<00:02:55.380> 90

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
have enough to encompass for level 90

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.010 
have enough to encompass for level 90
range<00:02:55.950> which<00:02:56.340> is<00:02:56.520> currently<00:02:56.910> my<00:02:57.120> goal<00:02:57.360> so<00:02:57.720> now

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
range which is currently my goal so now

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.620 
range which is currently my goal so now
I'm<00:02:58.709> pretty<00:02:59.130> sure<00:02:59.430> that<00:02:59.610> I<00:02:59.670> will<00:02:59.880> get<00:03:00.030> 90<00:03:00.420> range

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
I'm pretty sure that I will get 90 range

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.530 
I'm pretty sure that I will get 90 range
no<00:03:01.080> problem<00:03:01.590> so<00:03:02.430> thank<00:03:02.910> you<00:03:02.970> for<00:03:03.150> watching
