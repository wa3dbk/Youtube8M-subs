00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 do you want the same t-shirt print then 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:13.049
 see right now how it is right 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:15.240
 make it as printable 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.100
 T-shirts I chose the YouTube logo 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.410
 find it can be oddly enough on 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.420
 youtube link in description 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.420
 open your favorite graphic 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.130
 editor i use photoshop do 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.310
 optimal logo size 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.920
 my logo will be full page doing 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.050
 printing on self-adhesive paper can 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.850
 use and plain paper but then 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.370
 stencil will be difficult to fix on 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.840
 T-shirt so that it does not move in 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.840
 the result will suffer quality 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.329
 clinker smeared all toner 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.879
 youtube is indignant okay it's not like that 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.370
 important take centers takes with the help 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.120
 clerical knife 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:59.100
 neatly on the line each letter 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:03.120
 next we need a t-shirt 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:06.150
 clips tassels sheet cardboard or thick 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.900
 paper and most importantly acrylic paints 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.420
 by fabric 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.409
 I think for youtube perfectly fit two 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.659
 colors black and red sheet of cardboard 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.880
 need to paint did not get on another 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.580
 side of the shirt we put a sheet of cardboard 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.200
 inside 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.600
 clips we fasten a T-shirt so that she 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.600
 did not move in the process of applying paint 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:34.659
 glue the stencil to the shirt is not 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.549
 some need to stick as best as possible 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.850
 stencil to paint the moment of application 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:41.530
 did not flow to the edges smooth the paper 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.500
 nail then we will still be easy 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.210
 take off 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.049
 do not forget to stick the remaining letters 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.600
 for logo 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:54.369
 you are dust and yes that's exactly the letters 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.789
 are read in Russian for those who are strong in 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:00.490
 English and now we put paint on 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:02.350
 fabric in a thin layer while applying 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.810
 Iâ€™m going to talk about speed 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.970
 these paints need acrylic paints according to 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.810
 fabrics or as they are called paints 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.580
 for batik 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.830
 you can find them in stationery stores 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.470
 or in handicraft stores 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.819
 in my case, a set of 12 colors was worth 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.860
 300 69 rubles 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.269
 You can also buy them separately in 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.799
 on average, one bank costs 30-40 rubles and 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.590
 so in less than half a minute I managed 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:28.030
 decorate t-shirt 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.610
 leave for a couple of hours to paint 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:35.010
 dried out 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.010
 the paint is dry so tear off the stencil 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.730
 in my opinion for the first time not bad 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.710
 like it if you like it 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.240
 video and subscribe to the channel as 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.240
 right if you haven't done it yet
