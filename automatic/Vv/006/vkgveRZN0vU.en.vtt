starting to get really spicy here what

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.830 
starting to get really spicy here what
looked<00:05:11.040> to<00:05:11.130> be<00:05:11.220> a<00:05:11.370> solid<00:05:11.880> lead<00:05:12.060> for<00:05:12.450> the<00:05:12.540> purple

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
looked to be a solid lead for the purple

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.730 
looked to be a solid lead for the purple
team<00:05:13.040> quickly<00:05:14.040> switched<00:05:14.580> up<00:05:14.850> and<00:05:15.710> now<00:05:16.710> they're

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
team quickly switched up and now they're

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.680 
team quickly switched up and now they're
behind<00:05:17.190> quite<00:05:17.550> a<00:05:17.640> bit<00:05:17.850> and<00:05:18.030> they<00:05:18.300> need<00:05:18.450> to<00:05:18.570> do

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
behind quite a bit and they need to do

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:26.180 
behind quite a bit and they need to do
some<00:05:18.900> catching<00:05:19.080> up<00:05:19.320> I<00:05:24.290> think<00:05:25.290> the<00:05:25.830> blue<00:05:26.010> team

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
some catching up I think the blue team

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.640 
some catching up I think the blue team
is<00:05:26.370> a<00:05:26.400> little<00:05:26.520> more<00:05:26.730> free<00:05:27.060> now<00:05:27.240> to<00:05:27.650> maneuver

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
is a little more free now to maneuver

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.220 
is a little more free now to maneuver
around<00:05:28.680> and<00:05:29.070> maybe<00:05:29.190> Jung<00:05:29.490> a<00:05:29.520> little<00:05:29.790> bit<00:05:29.910> or<00:05:30.870> do

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.230 
around and maybe Jung a little bit or do

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.200 
around and maybe Jung a little bit or do
something<00:05:31.470> like<00:05:31.620> that<00:05:31.680> i'm<00:05:31.980> not<00:05:32.010> sure<00:05:32.210> i'll

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
something like that i'm not sure i'll

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.700 
something like that i'm not sure i'll
check<00:05:33.480> the<00:05:33.600> mini-map<00:05:33.930> in<00:05:34.110> a<00:05:34.200> second<00:05:34.530> and<00:05:34.620> i'll

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
check the mini-map in a second and i'll

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:35.750 
check the mini-map in a second and i'll
actually<00:05:34.860> make<00:05:35.190> sure<00:05:35.340> i've<00:05:35.430> moved<00:05:35.550> my

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
actually make sure i've moved my

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:44.570 
actually make sure i've moved my
champion<00:05:40.700> so<00:05:41.700> now<00:05:42.500> we<00:05:43.500> are<00:05:43.530> in<00:05:43.950> the<00:05:43.980> middle<00:05:44.370> of

champion so now we are in the middle of
this<00:05:44.790> battle<00:05:46.010> pushing<00:05:47.010> them<00:05:47.130> back<00:05:47.160> they're

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
this battle pushing them back they're

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.000 
this battle pushing them back they're
not<00:05:47.700> getting<00:05:47.940> much<00:05:48.150> damage<00:05:48.540> on<00:05:48.660> the<00:05:48.750> tower

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
not getting much damage on the tower

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:50.900 
not getting much damage on the tower
although<00:05:50.010> they're<00:05:50.160> getting<00:05:50.400> a<00:05:50.460> lot<00:05:50.610> of<00:05:50.640> damage

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:50.910 
although they're getting a lot of damage

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.030 
although they're getting a lot of damage
overall<00:05:51.570> on<00:05:52.050> the<00:05:52.260> champions<00:05:52.770> they're<00:05:52.920> not

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:53.040 
overall on the champions they're not

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.280 
overall on the champions they're not
getting<00:05:53.250> that<00:05:53.400> much<00:05:53.580> kills<00:05:53.880> and<00:05:54.210> the<00:05:55.140> blue

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.290 
getting that much kills and the blue

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.260 
getting that much kills and the blue
team<00:05:55.500> is<00:05:55.620> playing<00:05:55.800> really<00:05:56.040> responsibly<00:05:57.000> at

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
team is playing really responsibly at

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.570 
team is playing really responsibly at
low<00:05:57.450> HP<00:05:57.900> and<00:05:58.170> I<00:05:58.740> think<00:05:58.950> that's<00:05:59.100> making<00:05:59.370> a<00:05:59.430> big

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
low HP and I think that's making a big

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:00.740 
low HP and I think that's making a big
difference<00:05:59.730> because<00:06:00.150> they're<00:06:00.270> able<00:06:00.360> to<00:06:00.540> lane

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
difference because they're able to lane

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.230 
difference because they're able to lane
for<00:06:01.080> a<00:06:01.110> long<00:06:01.320> time<00:06:01.590> I<00:06:01.860> mean<00:06:02.610> even<00:06:03.030> though

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
for a long time I mean even though

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.760 
for a long time I mean even though
they're<00:06:03.390> all<00:06:03.510> lunch<00:06:03.780> like<00:06:03.990> a<00:06:04.020> low<00:06:04.200> level<00:06:04.410> and

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
they're all lunch like a low level and

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:05.780 
they're all lunch like a low level and
it<00:06:04.920> looks<00:06:05.070> like<00:06:05.100> they<00:06:05.280> might<00:06:05.400> really<00:06:05.520> get<00:06:05.670> the

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:05.790 
it looks like they might really get the

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:07.010 
it looks like they might really get the
kill<00:06:05.970> off<00:06:06.060> on<00:06:06.210> slated<00:06:06.570> to<00:06:06.630> get<00:06:06.720> Apophis

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
kill off on slated to get Apophis

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.930 
kill off on slated to get Apophis
ultimate<00:06:07.290> on<00:06:07.410> himself<00:06:07.530> and<00:06:07.830> no<00:06:08.070> and<00:06:08.550> he<00:06:08.730> does

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 
ultimate on himself and no and he does

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.280 
ultimate on himself and no and he does
profit<00:06:09.330> so<00:06:09.420> that<00:06:09.510> doesn't<00:06:09.780> count<00:06:09.810> as<00:06:09.990> a<00:06:10.080> kill

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:10.290 
profit so that doesn't count as a kill

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.400 
profit so that doesn't count as a kill
obviously<00:06:10.710> and<00:06:11.100> Celine's<00:06:12.140> slashes<00:06:13.140> out<00:06:13.290> of

and<00:06:17.560> it<00:06:17.890> looks<00:06:18.160> like<00:06:18.570> Katerina's<00:06:19.570> pushing

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000

and it looks like Katerina's pushing
severe<00:06:22.000> might<00:06:22.180> be<00:06:22.300> able<00:06:22.360> to<00:06:22.450> get<00:06:22.600> killed<00:06:22.840> here

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.020 
severe might be able to get killed here

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.850 
severe might be able to get killed here
depending<00:06:23.620> on<00:06:23.710> if<00:06:23.830> they<00:06:23.920> deal<00:06:24.070> enough<00:06:24.400> damage
