they<00:01:51.869> have<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.079> cool<00:01:52.439> design<00:01:52.649> on<00:01:52.950> them<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.369> it

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
they have a cool design on them and it

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.600 
they have a cool design on them and it
sort<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.090> gives<00:01:54.270> them<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.630> hand<00:01:54.960> tool<00:01:55.200> look

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
sort of gives them that hand tool look

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.539 
sort of gives them that hand tool look
the<00:01:56.610> fine<00:01:56.880> point<00:01:57.180> tip<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.630> very<00:01:58.200> fine<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.860> the

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
the fine point tip is very fine and the

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.789 
the fine point tip is very fine and the
medium<00:01:59.880> point<00:02:00.090> tip<00:02:00.360> is<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.869> lot<00:02:01.200> closer<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.619> the

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
medium point tip is a lot closer to the

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.850 
medium point tip is a lot closer to the
tip<00:02:02.130> on<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.430> sharpie<00:02:02.850> fine<00:02:03.420> point<00:02:03.719> markers<00:02:04.140> so

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
tip on the sharpie fine point markers so

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.410 
tip on the sharpie fine point markers so
I<00:02:04.890> guess<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.219> can<00:02:05.369> call<00:02:05.549> them<00:02:05.729> both<00:02:05.880> fine<00:02:06.180> tip

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
I guess you can call them both fine tip

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.499 
I guess you can call them both fine tip
one<00:02:07.020> fine<00:02:07.290> tip<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:08.580> other<00:02:08.729> ultra<00:02:09.239> fine

will<00:02:34.599> be<00:02:34.780> using<00:02:35.079> a<00:02:35.290> regular<00:02:35.950> black<00:02:36.609> ink

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 
will be using a regular black ink

ink Sharpie prone with a chisel tip and

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.360 
ink Sharpie prone with a chisel tip and
I'll<00:02:42.730> be<00:02:42.849> using<00:02:42.970> a<00:02:43.239> Milwaukee<00:02:43.689> in<00:02:44.439> salt<00:02:44.859> medium

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
I'll be using a Milwaukee in salt medium

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.580 
I'll be using a Milwaukee in salt medium
point<00:02:45.609> tip<00:02:45.879> the<00:02:46.480> medium<00:02:46.810> tip<00:02:47.019> on<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.260> ink<00:02:47.409> saw

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
point tip the medium tip on the ink saw

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.009 
point tip the medium tip on the ink saw
is<00:02:47.859> very<00:02:48.400> similar<00:02:48.670> to<00:02:48.819> the<00:02:49.060> fine<00:02:49.269> point<00:02:49.599> tip<00:02:49.810> on

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
is very similar to the fine point tip on

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.710 
is very similar to the fine point tip on
the<00:02:50.139> regular<00:02:50.650> sharpie<00:02:51.129> except<00:02:51.849> it's<00:02:52.000> slightly

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
the regular sharpie except it's slightly

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.530 
the regular sharpie except it's slightly
thicker<00:02:52.989> and<00:02:53.260> a<00:02:53.920> little<00:02:54.129> bit<00:02:54.250> longer<00:02:54.540> alrighty

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
thicker and a little bit longer alrighty

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.390 
thicker and a little bit longer alrighty
then<00:02:55.810> so<00:02:55.959> after<00:02:56.079> using<00:02:56.440> all<00:02:56.560> three<00:02:56.709> I<00:02:56.980> have<00:02:57.250> to

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
then so after using all three I have to

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.679 
then so after using all three I have to
say<00:02:57.549> that<00:02:57.670> the<00:02:57.760> regular<00:02:58.120> sharpie<00:02:58.480> has<00:02:58.599> the

00:02:58.679 --> 00:02:58.689 
say that the regular sharpie has the

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:00.839 
say that the regular sharpie has the
best<00:02:58.900> ink<00:02:59.200> it<00:02:59.590> writes<00:02:59.889> the<00:02:59.980> darkest<00:03:00.519> and<00:03:00.670> is

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
best ink it writes the darkest and is

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:02.819 
best ink it writes the darkest and is
the<00:03:00.939> most<00:03:01.060> solid<00:03:01.480> zinc<00:03:01.659> comes<00:03:02.379> out<00:03:02.530> nice<00:03:02.799> and

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
the most solid zinc comes out nice and

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:05.190 
the most solid zinc comes out nice and
black<00:03:03.159> the<00:03:03.970> Milwaukee<00:03:04.359> came<00:03:04.659> in<00:03:04.780> second<00:03:05.170> with

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
ink output the Milwaukee so I had to

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.240 
ink output the Milwaukee so I had to
leave<00:03:18.910> the<00:03:19.510> Sharpie<00:03:19.959> Pro<00:03:20.199> came<00:03:20.500> in<00:03:20.650> second<00:03:21.099> and

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
leave the Sharpie Pro came in second and

leave the Sharpie Pro came in second and
the<00:03:21.669> regular<00:03:22.060> sharpie<00:03:22.449> came<00:03:22.720> in<00:03:22.840> at<00:03:22.930> it<00:03:23.019> close

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
the regular sharpie came in at it close

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.680 
the regular sharpie came in at it close
third<00:03:23.669> one<00:03:24.669> thing<00:03:24.849> while<00:03:25.000> testing<00:03:25.449> out<00:03:25.569> the

using<00:03:30.250> the<00:03:30.459> caps<00:03:30.669> on<00:03:30.849> the<00:03:30.909> markers<00:03:31.269> I<00:03:31.480> noticed

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
using the caps on the markers I noticed

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.509 
using the caps on the markers I noticed
that<00:03:32.109> the<00:03:32.230> Sharpie<00:03:32.560> Pro<00:03:32.769> has<00:03:32.889> a<00:03:33.010> sleeve<00:03:33.250> on<00:03:33.400> the

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
that the Sharpie Pro has a sleeve on the

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.970 
that the Sharpie Pro has a sleeve on the
inside<00:03:33.549> that<00:03:34.359> comes<00:03:34.569> off<00:03:34.720> the<00:03:34.840> cap<00:03:35.049> and<00:03:35.260> sticks

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
inside that comes off the cap and sticks

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.500 
inside that comes off the cap and sticks
the<00:03:36.159> marker<00:03:36.489> tip<00:03:36.669> when<00:03:36.849> you<00:03:36.940> rule<00:03:37.180> the<00:03:37.329> cap

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
the marker tip when you rule the cap

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.379 
the marker tip when you rule the cap
once<00:03:38.290> it<00:03:38.470> did<00:03:38.620> this<00:03:38.799> it<00:03:39.220> kept<00:03:39.519> on<00:03:39.730> doing<00:03:39.909> this<00:03:40.239> I

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
once it did this it kept on doing this I

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:42.210 
once it did this it kept on doing this I
removed<00:03:41.019> the<00:03:41.109> sleeve<00:03:41.379> but<00:03:41.650> then<00:03:41.799> the<00:03:41.919> marker

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
removed the sleeve but then the marker

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.339 
removed the sleeve but then the marker
cap<00:03:42.400> doesn't<00:03:42.609> stay<00:03:42.909> on<00:03:42.970> as<00:03:43.180> nicely<00:03:43.389> as<00:03:43.599> I<00:03:44.049> did

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
cap doesn't stay on as nicely as I did

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.349 
cap doesn't stay on as nicely as I did
with<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:44.590> sleeve<00:03:44.829> it<00:03:45.549> doesn't<00:03:45.940> affect<00:03:46.239> the

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
with the sleeve it doesn't affect the

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.210 
with the sleeve it doesn't affect the
performance<00:03:46.510> of<00:03:46.840> the<00:03:46.900> ink<00:03:47.139> but<00:03:47.829> found<00:03:48.010> it<00:03:48.129> to

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
performance of the ink but found it to

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.119 
performance of the ink but found it to
be<00:03:48.250> very<00:03:48.639> annoying<00:03:49.560> now<00:03:50.560> let's<00:03:50.769> see<00:03:50.919> how<00:03:50.979> they

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:51.129 
be very annoying now let's see how they

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:52.770 
be very annoying now let's see how they
did<00:03:51.370> with<00:03:51.549> writing<00:03:51.879> on<00:03:51.940> different<00:03:52.269> materials

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
did with writing on different materials

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.780 
did with writing on different materials
what<00:03:53.319> I<00:03:53.349> really<00:03:53.680> enjoyed<00:03:53.919> for<00:03:54.190> in<00:03:54.310> these<00:03:54.430> tests

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
what I really enjoyed for in these tests

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.149 
what I really enjoyed for in these tests
is<00:03:55.120> how<00:03:55.329> quickly<00:03:55.629> the<00:03:55.810> ink<00:03:56.049> dries<00:03:56.319> they<00:03:57.010> all

00:03:57.149 --> 00:03:57.159 
is how quickly the ink dries they all

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:59.099 
is how quickly the ink dries they all
did<00:03:57.370> great<00:03:57.519> on<00:03:57.639> wood<00:03:58.030> which<00:03:58.690> didn't<00:03:59.019> surprise

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
did great on wood which didn't surprise

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:02.149 
did great on wood which didn't surprise
me<00:03:59.379> as<00:03:59.739> the<00:04:00.220> wood<00:04:00.430> sucks<00:04:00.669> up<00:04:00.819> the<00:04:00.849> heat<00:04:01.030> quick

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:02.159 
me as the wood sucks up the heat quick

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:04.740 
me as the wood sucks up the heat quick
with<00:04:03.159> laminate<00:04:03.609> flooring<00:04:03.879> they<00:04:04.479> all<00:04:04.569> did

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
with laminate flooring they all did

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.930 
with laminate flooring they all did
about<00:04:04.959> the<00:04:05.109> same<00:04:05.290> the<00:04:06.099> ink<00:04:06.280> dries<00:04:06.489> up<00:04:06.669> quickly

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
about the same the ink dries up quickly

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.849 
about the same the ink dries up quickly
but<00:04:07.569> if<00:04:07.659> you<00:04:07.780> touch<00:04:07.959> the<00:04:08.169> ink<00:04:08.229> immediately<00:04:08.680> it

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859 
but if you touch the ink immediately it

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:13.050 
but if you touch the ink immediately it

used a plastic gallon container the only
ink<00:04:16.000> that<00:04:16.180> didn't<00:04:16.510> smear<00:04:16.750> was<00:04:17.019> a<00:04:17.079> sharpie<00:04:17.530> Pro

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
ink that didn't smear was a sharpie Pro

ink that didn't smear was a sharpie Pro
the<00:04:18.459> ink<00:04:18.699> saw<00:04:18.940> and<00:04:19.150> regular<00:04:19.630> Sharpie<00:04:20.049> both<00:04:20.530> did

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
the ink saw and regular Sharpie both did

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.519 
the ink saw and regular Sharpie both did
about<00:04:20.979> the<00:04:21.130> same<00:04:21.840> this<00:04:22.840> test<00:04:23.139> was<00:04:23.289> done<00:04:23.380> on

00:04:23.519 --> 00:04:23.529 
about the same this test was done on

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:26.310 
about the same this test was done on
ceramic<00:04:23.919> tile<00:04:24.130> they<00:04:24.880> all<00:04:25.000> did<00:04:25.180> the<00:04:25.300> same<00:04:25.330> they

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
ceramic tile they all did the same they

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.170 
ceramic tile they all did the same they
immediately<00:04:26.860> but<00:04:27.490> didn't<00:04:27.760> have<00:04:27.880> to<00:04:28.000> being

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
immediately but didn't have to being

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.590 
immediately but didn't have to being
dried<00:04:29.280> this<00:04:30.280> one<00:04:30.490> was<00:04:30.610> done<00:04:30.760> on<00:04:30.850> metal<00:04:31.150> what

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
dried this one was done on metal what

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.000 
dried this one was done on metal what
type<00:04:31.810> of<00:04:31.840> metal<00:04:32.080> I'm<00:04:32.410> not<00:04:32.590> sure<00:04:32.770> but<00:04:32.890> I'm

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
type of metal I'm not sure but I'm

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.040 
type of metal I'm not sure but I'm
guessing<00:04:33.220> aluminum<00:04:33.790> they<00:04:34.390> all<00:04:34.510> did<00:04:34.690> the<00:04:34.780> same

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
guessing aluminum they all did the same

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.770 
guessing aluminum they all did the same
and<00:04:35.290> the<00:04:35.710> ink<00:04:35.890> dried<00:04:36.130> on<00:04:36.250> contact<00:04:36.790> next<00:04:37.390> I<00:04:37.630> use

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
and the ink dried on contact next I use

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.960 
and the ink dried on contact next I use
a<00:04:37.870> plank<00:04:38.140> of<00:04:38.290> laminate<00:04:38.650> flooring<00:04:38.920> and<00:04:39.190> divided

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
a plank of laminate flooring and divided

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.730 
a plank of laminate flooring and divided
it<00:04:40.090> into<00:04:40.270> three<00:04:40.420> sections<00:04:40.810> for<00:04:41.200> the<00:04:41.260> next<00:04:41.530> test

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
it into three sections for the next test

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.500 
it into three sections for the next test
to<00:04:41.980> see<00:04:42.130> how<00:04:42.250> they<00:04:42.370> write<00:04:42.550> on<00:04:42.730> a<00:04:42.970> dusty<00:04:43.330> surface

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
to see how they write on a dusty surface

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.580 
to see how they write on a dusty surface
a<00:04:43.990> wet<00:04:44.710> surface<00:04:44.950> and<00:04:45.460> an<00:04:46.150> oily<00:04:46.510> surface<00:04:46.690> I<00:04:47.170> use

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
a wet surface and an oily surface I use

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.310 
a wet surface and an oily surface I use
sawdust<00:04:48.250> for<00:04:48.490> the<00:04:48.610> dusty<00:04:48.940> tests<00:04:49.210> and<00:04:49.480> they<00:04:50.110> all

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
sawdust for the dusty tests and they all

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.840 
sawdust for the dusty tests and they all
aced<00:04:50.620> that<00:04:50.770> test<00:04:50.920> I<00:04:52.950> use<00:04:53.950> play<00:04:54.190> water<00:04:54.490> for<00:04:54.760> the

aced that test I use play water for the
wet<00:04:55.000> test<00:04:55.270> and<00:04:55.510> the<00:04:55.900> Milwaukee<00:04:56.050> passed<00:04:56.620> this

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
wet test and the Milwaukee passed this

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.340 
wet test and the Milwaukee passed this
test<00:04:57.130> both<00:04:57.970> sharpies<00:04:58.480> wrote<00:04:58.690> on<00:04:58.810> the<00:04:58.930> surface

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
test both sharpies wrote on the surface

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.560 
test both sharpies wrote on the surface
but<00:04:59.830> the<00:04:59.980> prosy<00:05:00.400> kept<00:05:00.610> better<00:05:00.820> placement

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
but the prosy kept better placement

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.270 
but the prosy kept better placement
although<00:05:02.080> the<00:05:02.260> inked<00:05:02.500> on<00:05:02.620> both<00:05:02.800> sharpies

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.400 
although the inked on both sharpies
didn't<00:05:03.580> adhere<00:05:03.670> well<00:05:04.030> to<00:05:04.090> the<00:05:04.720> laminate<00:05:05.050> as<00:05:05.200> it

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
didn't adhere well to the laminate as it

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.830 
didn't adhere well to the laminate as it
was<00:05:05.560> easily<00:05:05.980> wiped<00:05:06.310> off<00:05:06.430> the<00:05:06.760> last<00:05:07.390> test<00:05:07.660> on

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
was easily wiped off the last test on

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.780 
was easily wiped off the last test on
the<00:05:07.930> laminate<00:05:08.290> I<00:05:08.380> use<00:05:08.590> cooking<00:05:08.830> spray<00:05:08.980> this

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:09.790 
the laminate I use cooking spray this

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.880 
the laminate I use cooking spray this
test<00:05:10.090> gave<00:05:10.300> us<00:05:10.450> in<00:05:10.570> the<00:05:10.660> crazy<00:05:10.930> results<00:05:11.530> and

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
test gave us in the crazy results and

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:13.410 
test gave us in the crazy results and
even<00:05:12.220> the<00:05:12.310> regular<00:05:12.460> Sharpie<00:05:12.970> was<00:05:13.120> able<00:05:13.390> to
