 It is It is a change-up in 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:48.320
 Tombs I also do this sort of arrangement, so how are you 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:51.790
 In a sense , it prospered earlier 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.790
 General coach url

 Continued straight strikeout with a ball 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:14.490
 Well might this times it can be said that I quite 9 brain specific battery of victory 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:17.960
 I liked things like because you'll do return to the starting lineup and does not move 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.960
 Begins from the end 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:29.150
 It would have been a meeting that would be a small point of 4 times by lol 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.860
 That's right it is not without almost 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.860
 Wow change ball sky swing strikeout 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.260

 Mr. Yuki for Otani pitcher and went to isono home Ratih is 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.860
 It looks like eating from the batter's box 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.360
 I feel- 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:54.600
 Still 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:59.020
 I'll roll around, I'll hit you for a while. 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:01.230
 yuki's entered When was this such a favorite of straights 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.230
 Yeah 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:08.319
 adamas riders continue to strike out 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:12.609
 I couldn't stop there, so it's quite like this 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:16.239
 Of much fan to hit the curve ball from the first pitch in the What about 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:19.439
 Helpless Mont now and it Trapped in would take 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.439
 Yes state yes 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.590
 In drove in Ow -8 rate 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.080
 I was straight 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:45.700
 3 scenes straight out 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:51.220
 The misconception that stood up was the longest inning 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:55.180
 Well I say I Boiningu be three myself to 6 times and because the best is to queuing seven times the best 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:59.319
 The bat is broken and Kondo follows, but I can not shoot 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:03.390
 It sounds Well that sort of say Kondo players are doing well is not ginger fun 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:03.390
 It is likely to exceed 99 in this sea 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.490
 Play this game 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:16.250
 Well in high school and university but each is rookie 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.340
 I was able to straighten my patience 154 km 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.860
 Stray coe strikeout strikeout 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.310
 Now is the Tsuji from respectively than three people who fancy a little while ago 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:45.070
 This is also due to how to put in force and pace distribution plan today because he will appear about 140 normally 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.190
 I was talking about a delusion 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.190
 Ha 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:54.520
 Well, our pitcher felt it early, right? 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:03.030
 Come on time straight 0151 that early in the middle 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:06.410
 It topped struck out Te I feel like slider change-up there were many 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.410
 It may also or are making 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.790
 Even 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.870
 The straight meander swings late 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:23.460
 This is also straight body cycle 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.460
 You can straighten 154 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:32.039
 If you think it was finished in the 110 series 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:32.699
 I do not know whether it is the end in 109 which I dropped, but this time for the time being 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:39.240
 the end 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:46.759
 After all it is all strikeout out, but it is all right but Judge does not sell for a moment 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:46.759
 But it is yer was this day Mashi Tao Kanesho superb pitching
