00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 and very good other friends and your former friend 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.319
 Bread comfort in a new video 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.730
 here the zoom are asking a lot this 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.540
 video and if you hear me a little weird 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:15.360
 the voice is that I'm a little sick that 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:17.100
 they went to one to one scene or they were not going to 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.109
 go eat half my family and I 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.640
 I wanted here in my house and dimension to 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.050
 say it's safe because I have a computer 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.449
 but it's not that really if I feel a 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.760
 little sick good not little I feel very 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.039
 sick but right now I am 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.410
 sweating and everything but it does not matter I 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.430
 I wanted forgiveness I wanted to bring you this 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.390
 video because they have been asking me 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:39.239
 since it's something textured and pax that I use 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.910
 and then I think I'm liking the idea 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.930
 to make a top of textures for the pvp 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:50.250
 funniest top of everything and today I'm going to 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.530
 bring the three better ones than me 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.730
 I use the best three, that is, the 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.590
 only ones that I have because those that I do not 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.840
 I like them I take them out and here I bring them bus 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.050
 except and well let's start with this 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.690
 that some very cute horses are going to 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:06.330
 texture package let's put 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.450
 the one who is in third place is this the 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.630
 monster pack and because it's third 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:15.110
 good if it's nice and everything but what 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.110
 What I do not 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.280
 what does not mean me did not call me so much 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.439
 because I did not put it in the first place yes I 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.049
 like to say these letters and everything as well as 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:29.140
 is on but what I did not like is 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:32.020
 that low fps is low but not much 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.640
 me in the very nice cows in the fields 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.229
 realistic but the bad is from this 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.450
 father is that the rules are going 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.310
 also in pigs not hair 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.250
 either no more is the cows and as 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.049
 that there are not minerals here 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.080
 that lava we're going to do here about 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:50.410
 holes to look at the water and its things 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:53.050
 until this here this is water water 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:56.380
 and the lava washes does not change the water or it 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.930
 look or look pretty I think that if not 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.480
 change I think so if it's pretty and well 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.120
 so let's make it bigger because 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.580
 is polluting does not have much 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.729
 difference let's put on armor 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:12.790
 so you can see how the diamond is 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:15.160
 look at this very good color so it 's blue 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.530
 I really like the diamond sword 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.280
 also look how it looks really good here 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.020
 is the armor 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.550
 this is for pp but to prevent it 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.950
 let's look at the sword on the sword in 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.930
 the sword I really love the 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.270
 mine sword look how it looks like you 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.040
 they put like this the very good sword 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.140
 they want 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.459
 I really like this text and password what 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.989
 I almost do not like is that lower 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:43.069
 pepe that is the only one I did not like 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:45.170
 proposed, no , nothing happens, the other 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:49.159
 text and fax the one that is in second place 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:51.230
 for me, that is, I think is the one 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:53.060
 I will leave the decision of the 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.590
 video 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.480
 As you are looking at it is very nice here and 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.580
 well very handsome as when saying the 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.360
 Spanish and how are you looking is 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.760
 transparent this and look lava lava 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.900
 If you change the look squares are 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.940
 smaller squares so that it 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.370
 look better 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.320
 look at the fire the fire also well the 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.990
 fire is very little of the upholsterer for 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.370
 pepe I spend it using this but 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.400
 I also found another one that I like more 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.500
 also the very nice sword also all 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.810
 and look how good the water is for you 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.720
 also very transparent very pretty and 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:31.500
 take off Calvary, take off and then 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.000
 particles when you hit and it did not come out we 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:37.140
 the particles come out I do not have them 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.520
 activated I have an instance 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.140
 I always have it normal I do not know why the 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.140
 I have a good job 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.060
 the animation of I have all the 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.159
 particles all this I do not know why not 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.629
 it comes out when it thinks to see the particles 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:52.400
 I knew I like them a lot 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:55.930
 we are walking because it is very good 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:58.370
 also this and we will connect place 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.379
 of úbeda in jaén the third place I 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:04.040
 I misjudged forgiveness in the first place this 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:06.409
 texture and pax that I like this one 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.719
 to use us, it is not very good 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:13.129
 for pvp or anything like that but look at the 

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:15.200
 sword is good I like the sword the 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:17.199
 water is also good to 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.459
 the particles as it looks very nice 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:21.859
 He washes it, also there all the 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.630
 particles is something like I say no 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.180
 it's a lot for bp because it burns you and 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:30.349
 it consumes you the whole screen as they see your 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:32.690
 fps is this how are they going and so I 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:34.759
 because the menu look like the menu look 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.800
 how is I like the menu a lot like 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:39.940
 look at all the things here is the 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.560
 apple very well look apple look 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.120
 there is because I took off my breastplate today 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.300
 Suddenly, another breastplate appeared 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.280
 look at the breastplate also there the armor the 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.650
 weapon is not too good the sword 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.720
 and look what I liked most about this are 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.370
 the positions and we're not going to put 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:01.900
 grab possible so that it comes in each 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:05.259
 one are here several look at the positions 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:07.030
 look like exhibitions like 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:09.540
 exhibitions that are the options 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.540
 as well 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.590
 as exhibitions the hair does not 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:18.270
 they like the positions good and this is my 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.270
 I allow myself 3d 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:24.900
