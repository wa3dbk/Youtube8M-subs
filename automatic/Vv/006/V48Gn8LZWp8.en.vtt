00:00:00.689 --> 00:00:05.650
 at the beginning of this year garmin 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.540
 introduced several new products 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.180
 reviews on some of them we already 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.550
 done earlier and today on my arm 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.990
 top model from the same line is 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.940
 garmin apex 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.590
 If we talk in general, this is a clock 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.660
 unusual here is gps 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.400
 topographic maps of them can 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.630
 use for multisport and in 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.460
 as a smart watch 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.590
 This is the most advanced device lineup. 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.810
 I have never been able to communicate with 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.820
 such a multifunctional clock though 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.990
 absolutely all you pix reminds me 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.149
 phoenix 3 models 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.309
 so the main issue that bothers 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:39.069
 many what is the difference between them 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.120
 I'll start with the external features of the epix watch 

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:42.309
 off-road 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.780
 this is some hummer in the world of watches hardly 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:45.940
 they are suitable for everyday 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.039
 use in the city on my hands they 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.139
 just look like some monsters 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:51.999
 their target audience is clearly male 

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:54.639
 but in nature you will not find yourself 

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:57.370
 satellites more convenient and useful than 

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:59.469
 epic screen color rectangular size 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.569
 1 and 4 inches of hardware differences from 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.819
 almost no phoenix 3 

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:06.160
 larger battery size 

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:08.590
 display and the lack of Wi-Fi options 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.270
 device customization no watch come in 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.350
 only in black with black 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.970
 rubber strap 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.740
 housing unlike broom street 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.350
 plastic but it feels very 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.290
 durable nails I certainly did not clog them 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.810
 but used without mercy in nature and 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.090
 during workouts and not a single scratch 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.850
 I did not add internal memory for hours 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.270
 hours 8 gigabytes can not be increased 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.030
 because 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.100
 epix corresponds to a protection class of 5 m on 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.710
 my look is real tourist clock 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.660
 must have at least ten from m but 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.670
 delve into the debate about this I 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.310
 I will not navigate when 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.290
 the help of two systems glonass and gps garmin 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.720
 very proud of its new antenna 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.730
 called exo which is built 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.320
 in an hour and I can not give any 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.140
 intelligible comments on this 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.360
 I will be glad to write about you 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.780
 me what do you think about harmin's navigation 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.880
 combined gps + glonass + new antenna 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.890
 I used the clock mostly in 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.500
 city ​​and no problems with navigation 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.780
 tested but the accuracy of the data in the city and 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.219
 things in the mountains are of course very different 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.469
 It seemed strange to me that 

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:12.549
 the manufacturer has not provided factory 

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:13.610
 option with heart rate monitor 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:15.830
 although the clock 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.840
 also for multisportsmen so for 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.150
 apex have to buy a heart rate monitor 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.490
 separate battery life hours 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.800
 a great achievement of the company I was charging and 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.170
 them about 1 time in 2 weeks at 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.510
 This weekly load DPS did not exceed 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.850
 5 hours in DPS mode the gadget should 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.320
 hold on for at least a day on the hull 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.240
 there are five buttons 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.490
 They are so large that they click on 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.530
 they will be comfortable even with gloves on the right 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.450
 two buttons lower back upper 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.310
 start stop which also brings up the menu 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.530
 workouts nothing new in mode 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.540
 epix workouts versus phoenix 3 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.490
 you will not find the same features the same 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.830
 The clock setting options are the same. 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.930
 analyzed indicators for short 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.950
 these are the capabilities of the most top multi 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.470
 sports watches 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.150
 on the left there are three buttons top light a 2 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.010
 bottom buttons up and down 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.890
 backlight time can be 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.050
 adjust from 8 seconds to 1 minute either 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.820
 establish that it burned always watch 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.590
 also equipped with a touchscreen display 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.360
 which really hangs 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.130
 it happens so often 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.560
 in time it became me a little bit 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.989
 annoy though on occasion he 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.100
 is more useful than buttons for example in mode 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.170
 work with maps 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.209
 by pressing the up and down buttons you can 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.130
 increase or decrease the map is the same 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.410
 the most can be done using touch 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.180
 buttons click on start stop change 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.160
 mode with scales on movement by 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.760
 card up and down appears here 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.560
 label 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.720
 And if you can tap on the screen 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.880
 set point for movement point 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.010
 will continue to suggest the way in which you 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.470
 will move to the point it may be 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.959
 triathlon running and so on cards this 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.060
 The main feature of the model and pets in Russia 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.820
 watches are shipped immediately loaded 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.519
 maps but in the usa or europe you can 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.560
 buy with them and without knowing it 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.600
 due to the fact that we are in the majority 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.730
 against paid content therefore 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.130
 the manufacturer accepted the only right 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.810
 the decision to sell it is ready 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.030
 product preloaded 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.680
 topographic maps in garmin not 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.900
 began to limit the ability to download 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.269
 third-party cards so every owner 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.549
 epic will be able to download any cards to your 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:15.620
 taste starting any workout with epix 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:17.570
 obtain additional screen with a map and 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.030
 if training has an ultimate goal then 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.709
 active will also be navigation by the way 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.040
 the end point of the workout can be 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.930
 set as on 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.210
 map and using the menu coordinates 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.730
 hours are very similar to phoenix 3 but all 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.950
 does have some differences turning over 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.380
 screen up and down buttons go from 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.450
 Card hours further activity screen with 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.460
 information on the number of steps completed 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.130
 distance to target distance traveled 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.560
 and the number of calories burned click still 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:46.020
 just down and get into the electronic compass 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.040
 altimeter barometer and temperature sensor 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.320
 the environment 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.240
 epix can also control music and 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.550
 watch weather calendar events and 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.650
 read all notifications coming in 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.600
 the phone clock is easily customized for 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.260
 yourself so let's stop on this a bit 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.000
 more 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.610
 hold the button for two seconds 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.590
 brings up the settings menu right here 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.990
 manage applications customize 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.580
 data screens activating up to 10 include 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.650
 or disable map display 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.720
 activate competition with virtual 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.850
 rival as well as collecting additional 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.950
 characteristics such as step frequency 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.900
 ground contact time and vertical 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.460
 fluctuations in the widgets section can 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.530
 activate or deactivate all 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.150
 displaying menu screens with 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.250
 dials of history too 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.200
 initially only one clock is loaded 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.940
 standard dial with connect 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.280
 aykyu can upload any 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.680
 liked absolutely free per hour 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.990
 can connect external sensors compass 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.820
 altimeter barometer or any sports 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.620
 a sensor such as a heart rate monitor or 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.900
 bicycle cadence back to the main 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.850
 menu to see some more 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.770
 interesting opportunities can be saved 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:49.110
 current location pushing total 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.760
 one button truth of the procedure is not 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.400
 as fast as I would like 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:55.440
 the inscription on the screen will be from a minute to 2 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.750
 whereupon the current location 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.160
 persist point can even be called but 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:02.100
 do it with three buttons 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:04.170
 engage in a tedious and uncomfortable in 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:06.360
 the main menu has navigation sections 

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:08.370
 points on the map using which you can 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.070
 build routes and focus on 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.170
 terrain it turns out that garmin epix is 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:15.750
 navigator and multi sports computer 

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:18.000
 on the wrist in a hike and while climbing 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:20.610
 on tops this device can become 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.710
 best friend she will warn about the fall 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.930
 pressure of sunset and sunrise 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.970
 act as a clock and alarm clock 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:29.040
 will show the weather for the coming hours 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.960
 true only when connected to 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.970
 Internet from phones to build a route 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.220
 to the end point and calculate the time 

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:36.190
 arrival there depending on the current 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.230
 pace is 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:40.150
 hours is another positive nuance about 

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:41.890
 which I did not have time to tell it 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:44.140
 vibration alert of rupture 

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:46.030
 phone connections and automatic 

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:47.800
 connect to the clock when turned on 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.630
 bluetooth function is not firstly 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.580
 will allow you to lose the phone and secondly 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:54.070
 will help you always receive a notification from 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:56.130
 smartphone when garmin epix first time 

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:58.300
 appeared on my hand I thought that 

00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:01.360
 hardly anyone will wear such 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:03.430
 pandora but how it happens when meeting 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.890
 with cool hours every day they are to me 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:08.320
 liked more and more and in the end I did 

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:09.880
 the conclusion is that apex is probably the most 

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.070
 heaped watch that I ever 

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:15.090
 test but their cost bites and 

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:17.890
 the time of the review was 46 thousand rubles 

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:20.380
 I recommend this watch to buy a climber 

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:22.600
 tourists fishermen and hunters but not from
