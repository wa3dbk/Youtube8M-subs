00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.870
 yes 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:16.240
 of bits starts at year 87 and from that 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.090
 moment we start with this tribute to 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.290
 the beatles that we were lucky enough to 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.550
 represent it in different countries as 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.140
 in england where we were assigned 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.150
 best beatle band in the world of all 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.500
 these years we went to it by shelling the 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.670
 things to conform that we are 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.670
 let's warn contemporaries 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.020
 so 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.610
 in moments in shows is different 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.829
 the band had a beatle band dresses 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.940
 like them and there plays in a turkey not 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.309
 they deserve the songs of the beatles 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.750
 us a theatrical show and we're going 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.339
 showing all the evolution of the 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.670
 videos is an audiovisual story in 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:51.670
 alive 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.680
 s 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.510
 same 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.510
 once 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.839
 we have the entire complete collection of 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.550
 the guitars used in the basses the 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.680
 battery the teams know they are the 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.960
 box amplifiers or I liked the 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.310
 videos that also helps create the 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.310
 sound of the 22 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.830
 how they sounded, it helps us to be able to 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.370
 achieve that sound well 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.370
 s 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.600
 you see 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.610
 one year we always try to reproduce 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.800
 the arrangements that they represented in 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.630
 his discography and respect the current 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.630
 they were recorded sound is pure weak 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.290
 they pay me 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.490
 when choosing a repertoire is very 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.470
 difficult for a record because good all 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.960
 the topics we obviously like we try 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.640
 of great themes that for us are a 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.140
 personal challenge because they are very 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.220
 difficult to record 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.210
 without more 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.210
 That I leave 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.120
 if this disc taiwan 7 or 8 months ago 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.070
 what we are presenting is the third 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.780
 in the previous you can we had a 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.850
 song recorded in the mythical studio 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.310
 abbey road number 2 that where the 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.160
 beatles recorded all their albums because 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.190
 when one enters well that chill of 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.780
 say good were these guys here or 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.430
 be creating a chapter of history 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.600
 with the instruments that were theirs 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.790
 the pianos are the same microphones 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.680
 let's say the same as if here john song 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.680
 lennon equal or for a whole emotion 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.170
 ah
