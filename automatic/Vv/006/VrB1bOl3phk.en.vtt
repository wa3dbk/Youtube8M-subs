completed<00:00:43.620> my<00:00:43.680> little<00:00:43.920> mission<00:00:45.020> now<00:00:46.020> I've<00:00:46.170> got

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
completed my little mission now I've got

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.029 
completed my little mission now I've got
to<00:00:46.469> build<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.680> hangar<00:00:48.260> which<00:00:49.260> again<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.649> buy<00:00:49.800> from

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
to build a hangar which again I buy from

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:57.400 
to build a hangar which again I buy from
the<00:00:50.160> store<00:00:51.710> put<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.829> wherever<00:00:53.010> that's<00:00:53.460> fine

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.049 

then<00:00:58.410> I<00:00:58.770> could<00:00:59.070> wait<00:00:59.250> for<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.579> finish

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
then I could wait for it to finish

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.849 
then I could wait for it to finish
building<00:01:00.329> but<00:01:00.780> I'm<00:01:00.899> supposed<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.350> speed<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.739> up

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
building but I'm supposed to speed it up

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.609 
building but I'm supposed to speed it up
so<00:01:02.219> that's<00:01:02.910> what<00:01:03.090> we'll<00:01:03.180> do<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:04.049> costs<00:01:04.290> coins

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
so that's what we'll do it costs coins

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.130 
so that's what we'll do it costs coins
which<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.369> soft<00:01:05.610> currency<00:01:06.140> by

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
which is the soft currency by

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.810 
which is the soft currency by
propeller-driven<00:01:07.680> plane<00:01:08.659> so<00:01:10.460> these<00:01:11.460> planes

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
propeller-driven plane so these planes

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.100 
propeller-driven plane so these planes
here<00:01:12.060> will<00:01:12.210> unlock<00:01:12.479> when<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.780> reach<00:01:12.960> higher

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
here will unlock when you reach higher

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.670 
here will unlock when you reach higher
