that there's four LED lights they light

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.450 
that there's four LED lights they light
up<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.290> indicate<00:00:34.320> how<00:00:35.040> much<00:00:35.250> battery<00:00:35.660> life<00:00:36.660> is

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
up to indicate how much battery life is

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.340 
up to indicate how much battery life is
left<00:00:38.460> on<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.090> essential<00:00:39.540> unit<00:00:39.870> while<00:00:40.110> you're

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
left on the essential unit while you're

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.200 
left on the essential unit while you're
in<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.590> field<00:00:40.800> there<00:00:41.340> are<00:00:41.460> two<00:00:41.610> volts<00:00:41.969> there's

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
in the field there are two volts there's

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.270 
in the field there are two volts there's
12<00:00:42.600> volt<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.350> course<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.710> 9<00:00:43.860> volt<00:00:44.100> but

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
12 volt and of course the 9 volt but

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.310 
12 volt and of course the 9 volt but
we're<00:00:44.910> gonna<00:00:45.030> leave<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.360> at<00:00:45.450> 12<00:00:45.719> volt<00:00:45.989> because

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
we're gonna leave it at 12 volt because

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.690 
we're gonna leave it at 12 volt because
that's<00:00:46.530> what<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.800> Blackmagic<00:00:47.370> designs

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
that's what the Blackmagic designs

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.290 
that's what the Blackmagic designs
camera<00:00:48.329> requires<00:00:48.920> now<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.340> design<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:51.000> quite

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
camera requires now the design is quite

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.680 
camera requires now the design is quite
essentially<00:00:51.750> pretty<00:00:52.170> sleek<00:00:52.670> it's<00:00:53.670> very<00:00:54.329> I

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
essentially pretty sleek it's very I

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.639 
essentially pretty sleek it's very I
phone<00:00:55.590> like<00:00:56.390> but<00:00:57.390> essentially<00:00:58.260> it's<00:00:58.440> very

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
phone like but essentially it's very

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:59.360 
phone like but essentially it's very
comfortable

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
comfortable

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.560 
comfortable
now<00:00:59.640> what<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.719> do<00:01:00.840> have<00:01:01.379> here<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:02.390> you're<00:01:03.390> going

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
now what I do have here is you're going

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.530 
now what I do have here is you're going
to<00:01:03.629> need<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.960> buy<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.470> special<00:01:04.890> wire<00:01:05.479> if<00:01:06.479> you're

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
to need to buy a special wire if you're

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.830 
to need to buy a special wire if you're
going<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.869> use<00:01:07.049> this<00:01:07.619> battery<00:01:08.010> brick<00:01:08.540> it's<00:01:09.540> the

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
going to use this battery brick it's the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.010 
going to use this battery brick it's the
four<00:01:10.290> point<00:01:10.530> eight<00:01:10.680> millimeter<00:01:11.369> Jack<00:01:12.150> port

four point eight millimeter Jack port
for<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:14.520> hook<00:01:14.970> up<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.360> hooks<00:01:15.600> up<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:16.049> the

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
for the hook up that hooks up to the

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.490 
for the hook up that hooks up to the
battery<00:01:17.100> brick<00:01:17.369> as<00:01:17.700> well<00:01:18.270> as<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.630> 1.7

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
battery brick as well as the 1.7

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.649 
battery brick as well as the 1.7
millimeter<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.520> essentially<00:01:21.270> hooks<00:01:21.450> up<00:01:21.630> to

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
millimeter that essentially hooks up to

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.070 
millimeter that essentially hooks up to
the<00:01:22.439> Blackmagic<00:01:22.950> pocket<00:01:23.100> now<00:01:24.000> I'm<00:01:24.750> going<00:01:24.990> to

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
the Blackmagic pocket now I'm going to

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.899 
the Blackmagic pocket now I'm going to
pretty<00:01:25.590> much<00:01:25.770> essentially<00:01:26.520> connect<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.450> to

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
pretty much essentially connect it to

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.999 
pretty much essentially connect it to
okay<00:01:30.770> and<00:01:32.180> it's<00:01:33.180> always<00:01:33.420> good<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.960> have<00:01:34.619> at

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
okay and it's always good to have at

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.880 
okay and it's always good to have at
least<00:01:35.070> one<00:01:35.610> battery<00:01:36.119> just<00:01:37.079> in<00:01:37.200> case<00:01:37.409> if<00:01:37.619> the

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
least one battery just in case if the

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.920 
least one battery just in case if the
battery<00:01:38.280> brick<00:01:38.430> loses<00:01:39.210> all<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.450> its<00:01:39.750> energy

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
battery brick loses all of its energy

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.440 
battery brick loses all of its energy
which<00:01:40.890> I<00:01:41.009> highly<00:01:41.310> doubt<00:01:41.520> I've<00:01:41.850> gone<00:01:42.799> hours

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
which I highly doubt I've gone hours

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.740 
which I highly doubt I've gone hours
with<00:01:45.450> it

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
with it

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.590 
with it
and<00:01:47.430> it's<00:01:48.430> a<00:01:48.550> it's<00:01:48.850> good<00:01:49.090> to<00:01:49.210> just<00:01:49.240> have<00:01:49.450> one

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
and it's a it's good to just have one

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.260 
and it's a it's good to just have one
battery<00:01:50.320> in<00:01:50.440> there<00:01:50.650> just<00:01:50.950> at<00:01:51.160> least<00:01:51.310> yeah<00:01:51.610> just

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
battery in there just at least yeah just

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.900 
battery in there just at least yeah just
to<00:01:52.420> let<00:01:52.600> you<00:01:52.720> know<00:01:52.750> that<00:01:53.170> indicates<00:01:53.710> that<00:01:53.910> you

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910 
to let you know that indicates that you

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.030 
to let you know that indicates that you
know<00:01:55.000> things<00:01:55.540> are<00:01:55.720> running<00:01:56.050> out<00:01:56.170> and<00:01:56.440> you<00:01:56.890> need

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
know things are running out and you need

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.880 
know things are running out and you need
to<00:01:57.220> now<00:01:57.370> use<00:01:57.610> a<00:01:57.640> battery<00:01:58.030> so<00:01:58.690> I<00:01:59.050> have<00:01:59.680> that

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
to now use a battery so I have that

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.650 
to now use a battery so I have that
plugged<00:02:00.130> in<00:02:00.250> now<00:02:00.490> quite<00:02:00.910> essentially<00:02:01.330> if<00:02:01.480> you

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
plugged in now quite essentially if you

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.990 
plugged in now quite essentially if you
see<00:02:02.020> on<00:02:03.420> this<00:02:04.420> port<00:02:04.870> here<00:02:04.960> if<00:02:05.590> I<00:02:05.770> can<00:02:05.980> okay<00:02:06.940> so

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
see on this port here if I can okay so

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.770 
see on this port here if I can okay so
you<00:02:07.540> see<00:02:07.780> that<00:02:07.960> it's<00:02:08.410> my<00:02:09.100> battery<00:02:09.490> life<00:02:09.820> is<00:02:10.270> at

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
you see that it's my battery life is at

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:18.390 
you see that it's my battery life is at
14%<00:02:11.200> but<00:02:12.780> now<00:02:13.780> if<00:02:14.380> I<00:02:14.620> were<00:02:14.890> to<00:02:14.950> turn<00:02:15.280> it<00:02:15.460> on<00:02:17.400> you
