the outdoor pool here in Orange Beach
because<00:00:32.309> it's<00:00:32.730> very<00:00:33.059> cold<00:00:33.510> so<00:00:33.719> it's<00:00:34.020> similar

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
because it's very cold so it's similar

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.799 
because it's very cold so it's similar
to<00:00:34.649> using<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:35.130> cold<00:00:35.370> tank<00:00:35.610> which<00:00:35.880> helps<00:00:36.210> our

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
well it was a little bit of shock at

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.540 
well it was a little bit of shock at
first<00:00:42.989> but<00:00:43.320> then<00:00:43.500> once<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:43.920> get<00:00:44.070> moving<00:00:44.219> you

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
first but then once you get moving you

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.220 
first but then once you get moving you
get<00:00:44.730> used<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.360> it's<00:00:45.539> fine<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:46.079> was

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
get used to it and it's fine it was

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:56.350 
get used to it and it's fine it was
actually<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:46.800> actually<00:00:47.280> liked<00:00:47.670> it

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.330 

it's<00:00:57.360> just<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.900> great<00:00:58.290> thing<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.980> be<00:00:59.130> able<00:00:59.250> to

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
it's just a great thing to be able to

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.540 
it's just a great thing to be able to
have<00:00:59.580> a<00:00:59.880> cold<00:01:00.300> pool<00:01:00.780> there<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.830> an<00:01:01.980> indoor<00:01:02.280> pool

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
have a cold pool there is an indoor pool

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.860 
have a cold pool there is an indoor pool
here<00:01:02.880> which<00:01:03.090> would<00:01:03.330> have<00:01:03.420> been<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.570> lot<00:01:03.840> nicer

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
here which would have been a lot nicer

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.350 
here which would have been a lot nicer
for<00:01:04.530> them<00:01:04.680> but<00:01:05.400> it's<00:01:05.700> not<00:01:05.820> going<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.060> help<00:01:06.240> us

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
for them but it's not going to help us

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.570 
for them but it's not going to help us
recover<00:01:06.720> well<00:01:07.080> it's<00:01:07.680> like<00:01:07.950> part<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.430> our

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
recover well it's like part of our

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.450 
recover well it's like part of our
generation<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:09.750> like<00:01:10.230> you<00:01:10.650> get<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:11.070> get<00:01:11.280> like

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
generation so like you get you get like

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.060 
generation so like you get you get like
stretching<00:01:11.970> in<00:01:12.120> and<00:01:12.540> like<00:01:13.050> your<00:01:13.440> muscle

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
stretching in and like your muscle

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.980 
stretching in and like your muscle
relaxed<00:01:14.490> in<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.850> pool<00:01:15.120> and<00:01:15.420> it's<00:01:15.570> just<00:01:15.810> like

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
relaxed in the pool and it's just like

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.560 
relaxed in the pool and it's just like
different<00:01:16.170> more<00:01:16.560> like<00:01:16.800> although<00:01:17.760> the<00:01:18.120> rest<00:01:18.360> of

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
different more like although the rest of

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.900 
different more like although the rest of
the<00:01:18.720> team<00:01:18.930> probably<00:01:19.680> wouldn't<00:01:20.040> agree<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.760> it

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
the team probably wouldn't agree that it

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.620 
the team probably wouldn't agree that it
was<00:01:21.030> relaxing<00:01:22.550> at<00:01:23.550> first<00:01:23.910> I<00:01:24.150> think<00:01:24.210> they're
