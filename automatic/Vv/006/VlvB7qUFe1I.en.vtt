distinctive sort of little riff at the

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
beginning which I've tried to copy so i

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.840 
beginning which I've tried to copy so i
will<00:00:57.570> start<00:00:57.780> with<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.260> baseline<00:00:58.739> which<00:00:59.520> just

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
will start with the baseline which just

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:14.660 
will start with the baseline which just
goes

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.490 

and<00:01:15.670> that's<00:01:15.820> the<00:01:16.150> introduction<00:01:17.400> then<00:01:18.400> for<00:01:18.850> the

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
and that's the introduction then for the

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:31.260 
and that's the introduction then for the
verse<00:01:20.500> I<00:01:20.860> think<00:01:21.100> I<00:01:21.310> just<00:01:21.399> did<00:01:21.909> this<00:01:30.119> just<00:01:31.119> like

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
verse I think I just did this just like

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.270 
verse I think I just did this just like
the<00:01:31.479> introduction<00:01:31.990> again<00:01:35.070> then<00:01:36.070> with<00:01:36.250> a

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
the introduction again then with a

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:50.580 
the introduction again then with a
variation<00:01:48.210> so<00:01:49.210> as<00:01:49.330> you<00:01:49.360> can<00:01:49.600> see<00:01:49.840> it's<00:01:50.080> just<00:01:50.200> a

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
variation so as you can see it's just a

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.700 
variation so as you can see it's just a
B<00:01:51.369> C<00:01:51.940> sharp<00:01:51.970> minor<00:01:52.420> and<00:01:52.810> a<00:01:52.960> over<00:01:53.500> and<00:01:53.619> over

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
B C sharp minor and a over and over

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.469 
B C sharp minor and a over and over
again<00:01:53.950> it<00:01:54.460> doesn't<00:01:54.729> matter<00:01:54.789> if<00:01:55.000> you<00:01:55.149> don't<00:01:55.360> do

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
again it doesn't matter if you don't do

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.559 
again it doesn't matter if you don't do
exactly<00:01:55.509> what<00:01:55.899> I<00:01:55.990> did<00:01:56.289> is<00:01:56.409> just<00:01:56.440> why<00:01:57.369> do<00:01:57.569> and

00:01:58.559 --> 00:01:58.569 
exactly what I did is just why do and

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
you can see how the baseline and that

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.610 
you can see how the baseline and that
fit<00:02:42.790> is<00:02:43.090> and<00:02:44.550> yes<00:02:45.550> it's<00:02:45.849> basically<00:02:46.209> a<00:02:46.620> c-sharp

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
fit is and yes it's basically a c-sharp

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.720 
fit is and yes it's basically a c-sharp
minor<00:02:47.950> and<00:02:48.580> then<00:02:49.209> be<00:02:49.510> major<00:02:49.989> that's<00:02:50.769> it<00:02:50.920> and<00:02:51.160> a

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
minor and then be major that's it and a

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
doesn't even come in until the verse so

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.710 
doesn't even come in until the verse so
that's<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:55.260> introduction<00:02:56.519> then<00:02:57.519> and<00:02:57.849> what<00:02:58.690> I

I like to put their to the second finger
in<00:03:47.569> a<00:03:48.500> major<00:03:48.920> just<00:03:49.760> to<00:03:49.850> make<00:03:50.000> it<00:03:50.030> make<00:03:50.269> a<00:03:50.300> sound

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
in a major just to make it make a sound

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.900 
in a major just to make it make a sound
a<00:03:50.570> little<00:03:50.660> bit<00:03:50.989> more<00:03:51.140> gooey<00:03:51.370> and<00:03:52.370> that<00:03:52.700> you<00:03:52.880> can

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
a little bit more gooey and that you can

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.790 
a little bit more gooey and that you can
sustain<00:03:53.480> from<00:03:53.810> the<00:03:54.140> B<00:03:55.130> major<00:03:55.840> so<00:03:56.840> and<00:03:57.200> once<00:03:57.680> you

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
sustain from the B major so and once you

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.160 
sustain from the B major so and once you
go<00:03:57.890> back<00:03:58.070> onto<00:03:58.430> the<00:03:58.940> chorus<00:03:59.420> which<00:03:59.810> is<00:04:00.050> the

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
go back onto the chorus which is the

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.580 
go back onto the chorus which is the
same<00:04:00.380> chords<00:04:00.830> again<00:04:01.130> and<00:04:01.630> and<00:04:02.630> i<00:04:02.900> think<00:04:02.930> i<00:04:03.410> did

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
same chords again and and i think i did

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:12.160 
same chords again and and i think i did
the<00:04:03.709> same<00:04:03.860> base<00:04:04.069> time<00:04:04.370> to<00:04:04.640> just<00:04:08.950> know<00:04:10.840> and<00:04:11.840> with

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
the same base time to just know and with

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.210 
the same base time to just know and with
our<00:04:12.519> stretched<00:04:13.519> oh<00:04:13.880> that's<00:04:14.720> it<00:04:14.870> i<00:04:15.080> will<00:04:15.860> sing

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
our stretched oh that's it i will sing

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:22.800 
our stretched oh that's it i will sing
out<00:04:16.900> melody<00:04:19.510> so<00:04:20.510> you<00:04:20.600> get<00:04:20.720> the<00:04:20.900> feel<00:04:21.109> for<00:04:21.140> it<00:04:21.440> I

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
out melody so you get the feel for it I

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.060 
out melody so you get the feel for it I
don't<00:04:23.810> normally<00:04:23.930> put<00:04:24.229> the<00:04:24.350> third<00:04:24.560> fingering

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
don't normally put the third fingering

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:38.980 
don't normally put the third fingering
cuz<00:04:25.190> it<00:04:25.280> makes<00:04:25.310> the<00:04:25.610> board<00:04:25.850> sound<00:04:26.090> a<00:04:26.180> bit<00:04:26.210> murky

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.570 

and<00:04:39.080> then<00:04:39.710> we're<00:04:39.860> back<00:04:39.980> to<00:04:40.040> the<00:04:40.190> riff<00:04:40.340> again

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
and then we're back to the riff again

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.440 
and then we're back to the riff again
for<00:04:40.880> the<00:04:41.000> introduction<00:04:41.300> the<00:04:42.080> right<00:04:42.350> hand<00:04:42.680> and

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
for the introduction the right hand and

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.420 
for the introduction the right hand and
simply<00:04:44.450> does<00:04:44.930> this<00:04:45.230> is<00:04:45.410> the<00:04:45.530> power<00:04:45.740> cord<00:04:46.100> stuff

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
simply does this is the power cord stuff

00:04:46.430 --> 00:05:19.150 
simply does this is the power cord stuff
it's<00:04:47.300> just<00:05:16.000> and<00:05:17.350> then<00:05:18.350> bats<00:05:18.590> the<00:05:18.770> introduction

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
it's just and then bats the introduction

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:34.000 
it's just and then bats the introduction
again<00:05:32.260> bear<00:05:33.260> in<00:05:33.410> mind<00:05:33.470> that<00:05:33.650> the<00:05:33.770> bass<00:05:33.920> line

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
again bear in mind that the bass line

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.340 
again bear in mind that the bass line
stays<00:05:34.400> the<00:05:34.610> same<00:05:34.820> and<00:05:35.090> for<00:05:35.630> the<00:05:35.720> ending<00:05:36.170> this

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.350 
stays the same and for the ending this

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:37.990 
stays the same and for the ending this
is<00:05:36.530> all<00:05:36.650> I<00:05:36.680> did<00:05:36.980> is<00:05:37.160> the<00:05:37.310> introduction<00:05:37.640> again

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
is all I did is the introduction again

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.220 
is all I did is the introduction again
but<00:05:38.150> with<00:05:38.270> just<00:05:38.390> a<00:05:38.540> tiny<00:05:38.720> little<00:05:38.870> chord

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:39.230 
but with just a tiny little chord

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.900 
but with just a tiny little chord
progression<00:05:39.620> at<00:05:39.710> the<00:05:39.770> end<00:05:39.920> and<00:05:40.180> so<00:05:41.180> it<00:05:41.240> goes

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
progression at the end and so it goes

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:56.800 
progression at the end and so it goes
I'll<00:05:43.910> just<00:05:44.060> do<00:05:44.240> it<00:05:44.330> once<00:05:54.610> that's<00:05:55.610> it<00:05:55.820> and<00:05:56.690> the

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
I'll just do it once that's it and the

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:10.990 
I'll just do it once that's it and the
baseline<00:05:57.290> just<00:05:57.500> goes

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.409 

there<00:06:12.000> you<00:06:12.120> go<00:06:12.330> easy<00:06:12.750> as<00:06:13.080> pie<00:06:13.110> and<00:06:14.210> hope<00:06:15.210> that
