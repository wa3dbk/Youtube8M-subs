00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.720
 hello everyone welcome today we are going to 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.220
 teach how to make some cookies 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.990
 Butter 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.310
 to make some butter cookies 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.349
 we are going to need 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.079
 obviously butters is a 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:37.059
 salted butter 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:38.050
 two eggs sugar a bit of vanilla 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:40.420
 what we have done has been 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.140
 open a pod extract the seed if not 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.420
 you have 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.860
 baina s vanilla pod so 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.190
 could you use would be extract from 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.900
 vanilla and apart we have the flour that 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.840
 We have previously processed the 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.660
 here in this bowl we are going to put what 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.680
 First 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.680
 the butter 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.170
 inside this bowl 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.090
 and we're going to work a little with the 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.560
 hands, although it is already in ointment 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:13.950
 to work a little more so that then 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.950
 the incorporation is much easier 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.659
 simply the color of two we go 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.020
 pressing the hands obviously well 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.020
 clean 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.400
 we are doing inside a 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.450
 bowl well you could do the 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.380
 surface 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.380
 of a table 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:46.010
 directly on a robot a bit like 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.490
 like you 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.490
 see 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.290
 certainly in the bowl it gets a lot stained 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.860
 less 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.590
 good 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.150
 You see that the butter is already catching 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.140
 a consistency 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.140
 more creamy 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.599
 and what we need 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.599
 normal 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.769
 we do not have it here 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.900
 What are we going to do? 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.900
 flour 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.520
 together with sugar 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.830
 and the eggs 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.620
 let's also put 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.520
 the vanilla and we're going to go work it 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.520
 slowly 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.400
 once it has already incorporated perfectly 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:31.569
 all the flour and we have a good dough 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.360
 homogeneous 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:37.930
 we are going to give ball shape using the 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:41.069
 own bowl and what we will do is 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.069
 to be put on film 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.940
 so that during the time I go to 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.430
 rest that will be about two or three 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:51.490
 hours on camera do not dry out all 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.570
 the outside 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.570
 let's sign 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.730
 we're going to go to the camera for space 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:08.770
 2 to 3 hours to make it sit well 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.700
 repose and then we started to form the 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:14.300
 cookies 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.580
 well let's stretch the dough 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.019
 of the butter cookies you see the 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:21.530
 we have split in half because to 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:23.510
 this is going to spare us even with this 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.430
 half that we have caught 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.470
 let's sprinkle a little 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.670
 of flour on the surface of the marble 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.400
 to avoid that then 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:36.550
 the dough hits us 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.590
 and in turn we will also give you a little 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.580
 to 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.580
 to the mass itself 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:49.590
 With the help of a roller we are going to 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.590
 give also some flour 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.309
 and let's move on 

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:56.629
 to go stretching in the processor 

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:59.510
 It will also depend a little on your 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:02.510
 tastes with a thickness of half a centimeter 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:05.240
 It's enough 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:07.040
 well you see it's important that you'll be 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.830
 that takes off well because then to the 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.740
 time to remove the molds could we 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.740
 get stuck and good would be a job 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.740
 so 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:21.710
 as we see a little we give a little 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.710
 more sand if necessary 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:24.850
 and we continue 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.990
 We could use what we are going to 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.390
 do is going to be with the help of 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.630
 in this way to take out small 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.630
 portions 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.240
 we can not go putting 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.500
 in our baking sheet 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:52.009
 good 

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:55.589
 we are going to go with these to the oven 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:59.359
 that we have preheated to 170 degrees what 

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:59.359
 we will have for 12 minutes 

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:03.449
 well we come from the oven have elapsed 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.309
 twelve minutes you see that they are golden brown 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:07.190
 We are going to put a blackboard and you 

00:06:05.309 --> 00:06:08.630
 we present 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.620
 well , these would be our 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:11.620
 butter cookies
