between there there I guess just keep it
in<00:00:21.260> place<00:00:21.670> what<00:00:22.670> like<00:00:23.529> attach<00:00:24.529> it<00:00:24.710> to<00:00:24.740> that<00:00:24.860> and

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
in place what like attach it to that and

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.330 
in place what like attach it to that and
then<00:00:25.460> yeah<00:00:26.090> I'll<00:00:26.360> do<00:00:26.619> that's<00:00:27.619> just<00:00:27.890> silly<00:00:28.160> cut

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
then yeah I'll do that's just silly cut

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.150 
then yeah I'll do that's just silly cut
further<00:00:28.550> that<00:00:29.090> will<00:00:29.300> move<00:00:29.570> you<00:00:29.810> know<00:00:30.010> does<00:00:31.010> it

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
further that will move you know does it

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.630 
further that will move you know does it
move<00:00:31.280> this<00:00:31.629> only<00:00:32.629> a<00:00:32.660> little<00:00:32.809> bit<00:00:33.129> also<00:00:34.129> the

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
move this only a little bit also the

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.250 
move this only a little bit also the
vibrations<00:00:35.120> may<00:00:35.300> make<00:00:35.510> them<00:00:35.720> viewable<00:00:36.110> by<00:00:36.140> the

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
vibrations may make them viewable by the

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.130 
vibrations may make them viewable by the
way<00:00:36.440> mom<00:00:37.040> don't<00:00:37.400> be<00:00:37.430> hopes<00:00:37.699> up<00:00:37.879> vibrations<00:00:38.570> may

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
way mom don't be hopes up vibrations may

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.549 
way mom don't be hopes up vibrations may
be<00:00:39.199> so<00:00:39.530> great<00:00:39.770> these<00:00:39.980> what's<00:00:40.220> your<00:00:40.460> thing<00:00:40.640> I

developing<00:00:51.790> at<00:00:52.790> this<00:00:53.000> Quinn<00:00:53.300> just<00:00:53.479> in<00:00:53.629> case<00:00:53.780> it

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
developing at this Quinn just in case it

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.600 
developing at this Quinn just in case it
turns<00:00:54.050> out<00:00:54.140> recording<00:00:54.559> time<00:00:54.739> shouldn't<00:00:55.339> we'll

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
turns out recording time shouldn't we'll

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:06.940 
turns out recording time shouldn't we'll
just<00:00:55.760> get<00:00:55.909> out<00:00:58.210> don't<00:00:59.210> know<00:00:59.360> for<00:00:59.510> sure<00:01:05.950> ways

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
just get out don't know for sure ways

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.170 
just get out don't know for sure ways
forward<00:01:08.320> should<00:01:09.320> write<00:01:09.590> that<00:01:09.619> down<00:01:09.770> yeah<00:01:10.729> she

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
forward should write that down yeah she

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.399 
forward should write that down yeah she
write<00:01:11.390> down<00:01:11.570> which<00:01:11.630> way<00:01:11.780> for<00:01:11.840> is<00:01:12.020> instead<00:01:12.290> of

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
write down which way for is instead of

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.530 
write down which way for is instead of
guessing<00:01:15.370> you<00:01:16.370> guess<00:01:16.670> which<00:01:16.910> might<00:01:17.150> fall<00:01:17.360> with

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
guessing you guess which might fall with

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.110 
guessing you guess which might fall with
it<00:01:17.690> I<00:01:17.900> think<00:01:18.830> it's<00:01:18.950> that<00:01:19.010> way<00:01:19.130> fish<00:01:19.850> it's

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.120 
it I think it's that way fish it's

00:01:20.120 --> 00:02:02.930 
it I think it's that way fish it's
always<00:01:20.600> in<00:01:20.690> the<00:01:20.720> corner

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:12.710 

oh<00:02:08.210> really<00:02:09.470> I'm<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.530> little<00:02:10.860> nervous<00:02:11.420> if<00:02:12.420> it

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
oh really I'm a little nervous if it

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.720 
oh really I'm a little nervous if it
loses<00:02:12.840> transmitter<00:02:13.470> it<00:02:13.740> kills<00:02:14.040> itself<00:02:14.340> into

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
loses transmitter it kills itself into

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.480 
loses transmitter it kills itself into
Falls<00:02:15.650> say<00:02:16.650> they<00:02:16.800> didn't<00:02:17.040> try<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.220> recover

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
Falls say they didn't try to recover

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.070 
Falls say they didn't try to recover
anything<00:02:17.820> if<00:02:18.420> it's<00:02:18.630> gone<00:02:18.750> it's<00:02:18.930> gone<00:02:21.080> looks

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
anything if it's gone it's gone looks

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.860 
anything if it's gone it's gone looks
like<00:02:22.200> it's<00:02:22.730> transmitted<00:02:23.730> is<00:02:24.390> that<00:02:24.540> one<00:02:24.690> job

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
like it's transmitted is that one job

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.770 
like it's transmitted is that one job
red<00:02:25.200> red<00:02:27.380> one<00:02:29.000> that's<00:02:30.000> used<00:02:30.180> in<00:02:30.330> charge<00:02:30.570> of<00:02:30.690> the

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
red red one that's used in charge of the

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.260
