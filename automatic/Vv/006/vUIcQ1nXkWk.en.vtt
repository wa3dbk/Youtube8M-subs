cs5<00:01:11.970> really<00:01:12.360> shines<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.619> first<00:01:13.860> thing

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
cs5 really shines so the first thing

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.469 
cs5 really shines so the first thing
we'll<00:01:14.159> do<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.369> we'll<00:01:14.610> use<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.909> tool<00:01:15.270> that

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
we'll do is we'll use a tool that

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.210 
we'll do is we'll use a tool that
usually<00:01:15.900> doesn't<00:01:16.140> do<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.380> good<00:01:16.590> job<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.890> this

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
usually doesn't do a good job of this

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.840 
usually doesn't do a good job of this

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.719 
and just subtract a little bit more and
again<00:01:45.689> it's<00:01:46.200> it's<00:01:46.500> subtracting<00:01:47.340> but<00:01:47.579> it's

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
again it's it's subtracting but it's

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.240 
again it's it's subtracting but it's
still<00:01:48.030> not<00:01:48.390> doing<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:48.990> good<00:01:49.350> job<00:01:49.680> around<00:01:49.890> the

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
still not doing a good job around the

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.069 
still not doing a good job around the
hair<00:01:50.490> none<00:01:50.880> course<00:01:51.210> come<00:01:51.540> out<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.659> little<00:01:51.930> bit

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
hair none course come out a little bit

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.740 
hair none course come out a little bit
more<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.799> little<00:01:53.490> bit<00:01:53.520> more<00:01:53.790> there<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.090> maybe<00:01:54.630> a

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
more a little bit more there and maybe a

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.929 
more a little bit more there and maybe a
little<00:01:54.960> bit<00:01:55.140> more<00:01:55.350> there<00:01:55.740> but<00:01:56.399> that's<00:01:56.520> pretty

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
little bit more there but that's pretty

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.359 
little bit more there but that's pretty
much<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.509> best<00:01:57.750> this<00:01:58.020> tool<00:01:58.619> is<00:01:58.770> going<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.189> do

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
much the best this tool is going to do

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.209 
much the best this tool is going to do
so<00:02:00.030> now<00:02:00.240> we'll<00:02:00.509> go<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.899> new<00:02:01.229> refine<00:02:01.799> edge

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
so now we'll go to the new refine edge

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.209 
so now we'll go to the new refine edge
command<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.299> in<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:03.990> refine<00:02:04.439> edge<00:02:04.469> command

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
command and in the refine edge command

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.760 
command and in the refine edge command
I've<00:02:05.430> got<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:05.880> set<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.240> show<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:06.780> on<00:02:06.869> black<00:02:07.170> but

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
I've got it set to show it on black but

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.559 
I've got it set to show it on black but
we<00:02:07.920> can<00:02:08.099> look<00:02:08.280> at<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:08.610> or<00:02:08.729> preview<00:02:09.149> this<00:02:09.360> on

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
we can look at it or preview this on

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.420 
we can look at it or preview this on
different<00:02:09.810> layers<00:02:10.349> different<00:02:10.500> compositing

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
different layers different compositing

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.100 
different layers different compositing
modes<00:02:11.640> I<00:02:11.879> can<00:02:12.030> see<00:02:12.270> it<00:02:12.390> on

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
modes I can see it on

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.020 
modes I can see it on
red<00:02:13.260> overlay<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:13.860> can<00:02:14.010> see<00:02:14.130> it<00:02:14.220> on<00:02:14.310> white<00:02:14.550> I<00:02:14.820> can

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
red overlay I can see it on white I can

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.970 
red overlay I can see it on white I can
see<00:02:15.210> the<00:02:15.330> mass<00:02:15.600> that<00:02:15.930> it's<00:02:16.050> made<00:02:16.260> so<00:02:16.470> far<00:02:16.740> which

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
see the mass that it's made so far which

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.280 
see the mass that it's made so far which
is<00:02:17.130> horrible<00:02:17.640> I<00:02:17.820> can<00:02:18.360> see<00:02:18.540> all<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.780> various

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
is horrible I can see all the various

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.800 
is horrible I can see all the various
ways<00:02:19.470> of<00:02:19.680> looking<00:02:19.830> at<00:02:20.130> this<00:02:20.280> including<00:02:21.030> on<00:02:21.180> the

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
ways of looking at this including on the

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.240 
ways of looking at this including on the
background<00:02:22.320> that<00:02:22.500> I'm<00:02:22.590> going<00:02:22.740> to<00:02:22.770> put<00:02:22.980> it<00:02:23.100> on

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
background that I'm going to put it on

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.430 
background that I'm going to put it on
well<00:02:23.790> obviously<00:02:24.000> that<00:02:24.420> looks<00:02:24.840> horrible<00:02:25.260> so

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
well obviously that looks horrible so

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.630 
well obviously that looks horrible so
let's<00:02:25.620> go<00:02:25.710> ahead<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:25.950> take<00:02:26.070> care<00:02:26.100> of<00:02:26.340> it

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
let's go ahead and take care of it

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.550 
let's go ahead and take care of it
so<00:02:27.030> now<00:02:27.150> that<00:02:27.240> we've<00:02:27.480> seen<00:02:27.810> what<00:02:28.260> we're<00:02:28.440> going

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
so now that we've seen what we're going

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.950 
so now that we've seen what we're going
to<00:02:28.620> get<00:02:28.770> so<00:02:29.010> far<00:02:29.280> let's<00:02:30.030> go<00:02:30.210> in<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:30.540> check<00:02:30.810> out

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
to get so far let's go in and check out

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.900 
to get so far let's go in and check out
the<00:02:31.230> new<00:02:31.470> edge<00:02:31.800> detection<00:02:32.750> inside<00:02:33.750> of<00:02:34.050> cs5<00:02:35.040> so

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
the new edge detection inside of cs5 so

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.370 
the new edge detection inside of cs5 so
I'll<00:02:36.060> just<00:02:36.240> go<00:02:36.420> ahead<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:36.630> turn<00:02:36.720> on<00:02:36.900> a<00:02:36.930> smart

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
I'll just go ahead and turn on a smart

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.440 
I'll just go ahead and turn on a smart
radius<00:02:37.710> and<00:02:38.040> we'll<00:02:38.460> just<00:02:38.610> bump<00:02:38.850> up<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.150> smart

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
radius and we'll just bump up the smart

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.480 
radius and we'll just bump up the smart
radius<00:02:39.750> a<00:02:39.930> little<00:02:39.959> bit<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.830> be<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.010> little<00:02:41.310> bit

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
radius a little bit to be a little bit

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.610 
radius a little bit to be a little bit
softer<00:02:42.150> around<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.660> edges<00:02:43.050> that<00:02:43.170> are<00:02:43.230> soft

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
softer around the edges that are soft

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.590 
softer around the edges that are soft
this<00:02:43.860> is<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.190> intelligent<00:02:44.970> part<00:02:45.209> about<00:02:45.390> it

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
this is the intelligent part about it

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.810 
this is the intelligent part about it
I've<00:02:46.110> gone<00:02:46.380> a<00:02:46.440> little<00:02:46.709> too<00:02:47.010> far<00:02:47.250> let's<00:02:47.550> back<00:02:47.790> up

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
I've gone a little too far let's back up

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.449 
I've gone a little too far let's back up
just<00:02:48.060> a<00:02:48.360> bit<00:02:48.510> there<00:02:48.780> now<00:02:49.500> of<00:02:49.620> course<00:02:49.830> it<00:02:50.160> still

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
just a bit there now of course it still

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.360 
just a bit there now of course it still
didn't<00:02:51.060> it<00:02:51.270> didn't<00:02:51.690> do<00:02:51.810> very<00:02:51.840> much<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:52.739> in

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
didn't it didn't do very much and in

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.449 
didn't it didn't do very much and in
helping<00:02:53.670> me<00:02:54.000> get<00:02:54.150> rid<00:02:54.330> of<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.540> colors<00:02:54.900> that<00:02:54.930> I

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
helping me get rid of the colors that I

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.610 
helping me get rid of the colors that I
selected<00:02:56.459> by<00:02:56.610> mistake<00:02:57.030> or<00:02:57.360> that<00:02:58.200> I<00:02:58.230> had<00:02:58.470> no

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
selected by mistake or that I had no

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.500 
selected by mistake or that I had no
choice<00:02:58.860> in<00:02:58.890> selecting<00:02:59.489> so<00:02:59.970> now<00:03:00.180> we'll<00:03:00.480> use

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
choice in selecting so now we'll use

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.930 
choice in selecting so now we'll use
this<00:03:01.140> this<00:03:01.770> tool<00:03:02.100> that's<00:03:02.370> selected<00:03:02.790> by

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
this this tool that's selected by

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:03.470 
this this tool that's selected by
default

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
default

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.170 
default
it's<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:03.750> refine<00:03:04.470> radius<00:03:04.800> tool<00:03:05.070> and<00:03:06.030> I'll

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
it's the refine radius tool and I'll

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.940 
it's the refine radius tool and I'll
just<00:03:06.360> pump<00:03:06.600> up<00:03:06.750> my<00:03:06.870> brush<00:03:07.170> just<00:03:07.470> a<00:03:07.560> little<00:03:07.770> bit

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
just pump up my brush just a little bit

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.979 
just pump up my brush just a little bit
and<00:03:08.160> I'll<00:03:08.670> just<00:03:08.910> go<00:03:09.090> ahead<00:03:09.209> and<00:03:09.630> start

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
and I'll just go ahead and start

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.040 
and I'll just go ahead and start
painting<00:03:10.830> on<00:03:10.980> what<00:03:11.459> I<00:03:11.489> knew<00:03:11.820> to<00:03:12.090> be<00:03:12.120> gray<00:03:12.660> and

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
painting on what I knew to be gray and

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.410 
painting on what I knew to be gray and
it<00:03:13.440> looks<00:03:13.650> like<00:03:13.800> I'm<00:03:13.950> adding<00:03:14.459> more<00:03:14.640> gray<00:03:15.090> in

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
it looks like I'm adding more gray in

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.750 
it looks like I'm adding more gray in
when<00:03:15.780> in<00:03:15.900> fact<00:03:16.200> what<00:03:16.560> it's<00:03:16.709> doing<00:03:17.070> is<00:03:17.280> it's

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
when in fact what it's doing is it's

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.030 
when in fact what it's doing is it's
saying<00:03:17.910> oh<00:03:18.299> you<00:03:19.049> want<00:03:19.260> to<00:03:19.380> get<00:03:19.530> rid<00:03:19.739> of<00:03:19.769> that

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
saying oh you want to get rid of that

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.430 
saying oh you want to get rid of that
color<00:03:20.340> just<00:03:21.030> let<00:03:21.299> go<00:03:21.540> and<00:03:21.810> it<00:03:21.900> starts<00:03:22.200> to<00:03:22.290> get

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
color just let go and it starts to get

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.949 
color just let go and it starts to get
rid<00:03:22.590> of<00:03:22.620> that<00:03:22.860> color<00:03:23.160> out<00:03:23.430> of<00:03:23.489> the<00:03:23.790> image<00:03:23.930> so<00:03:24.930> I

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
rid of that color out of the image so I

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.210 
rid of that color out of the image so I
can<00:03:25.019> just<00:03:25.260> go<00:03:25.380> ahead<00:03:25.410> and<00:03:25.620> start<00:03:25.799> painting

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
can just go ahead and start painting

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.150 
can just go ahead and start painting
through<00:03:26.640> her<00:03:26.820> hair<00:03:27.180> where<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:28.110> gray<00:03:28.440> was<00:03:28.769> and

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
through her hair where the gray was and

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.370 
through her hair where the gray was and
it<00:03:29.370> will<00:03:29.519> go<00:03:29.730> ahead<00:03:30.000> and<00:03:30.239> start<00:03:30.570> to<00:03:30.750> subtract

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
it will go ahead and start to subtract

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.400 
it will go ahead and start to subtract
that<00:03:31.620> color<00:03:31.920> out<00:03:32.190> of<00:03:32.880> the<00:03:32.970> image<00:03:33.239> but<00:03:34.080> still

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
that color out of the image but still

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.210 
that color out of the image but still
keeping<00:03:34.980> her<00:03:35.370> nice<00:03:35.640> soft<00:03:36.090> hair<00:03:36.830> now<00:03:37.830> of<00:03:37.950> course

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
keeping her nice soft hair now of course

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.000 
keeping her nice soft hair now of course
depending<00:03:39.060> on<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.239> image<00:03:39.480> some<00:03:40.380> of<00:03:40.500> that<00:03:40.680> gray

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
depending on the image some of that gray

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.550 
depending on the image some of that gray
is<00:03:41.190> actually<00:03:41.580> reflected<00:03:42.299> into<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:43.080> subject

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
is actually reflected into the subject

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.039 
is actually reflected into the subject
itself<00:03:43.890> into<00:03:44.400> her<00:03:44.549> hair<00:03:44.790> so<00:03:45.420> it's<00:03:45.690> only<00:03:45.840> going

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
itself into her hair so it's only going

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.160 
itself into her hair so it's only going
to<00:03:46.170> do<00:03:46.470> so<00:03:46.980> much<00:03:47.310> in<00:03:47.580> this<00:03:48.360> painting<00:03:48.690> so<00:03:49.019> what

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
to do so much in this painting so what

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.080 
to do so much in this painting so what
I'm<00:03:49.260> going<00:03:49.350> to<00:03:49.410> do<00:03:49.650> is<00:03:49.920> go<00:03:50.700> ahead<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:50.910> do<00:03:51.060> a

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
I'm going to do is go ahead and do a

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.280 
I'm going to do is go ahead and do a
couple<00:03:51.269> of<00:03:51.450> things<00:03:51.510> I'm<00:03:51.780> going<00:03:51.930> to<00:03:51.989> turn<00:03:52.230> on

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
couple of things I'm going to turn on

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.250 
couple of things I'm going to turn on
the<00:03:52.730> decontaminate<00:03:53.730> colors<00:03:54.030> and<00:03:54.510> just<00:03:54.989> bump

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
the decontaminate colors and just bump

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.800 
the decontaminate colors and just bump
up<00:03:55.440> that<00:03:55.620> slider<00:03:56.040> just<00:03:56.549> a<00:03:56.670> bit<00:03:56.910> to<00:03:57.480> kind<00:03:57.690> of

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
up that slider just a bit to kind of

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.350 
up that slider just a bit to kind of
decontaminate<00:03:58.709> some<00:03:58.980> of<00:03:59.070> that<00:03:59.190> gray<00:03:59.580> out<00:04:00.030> of

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
decontaminate some of that gray out of

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.120 
decontaminate some of that gray out of
her<00:04:00.450> hair<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:00.930> next<00:04:01.320> thing<00:04:01.560> I<00:04:01.680> can<00:04:01.860> do<00:04:01.980> is<00:04:02.100> just

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
her hair the next thing I can do is just

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.550 
her hair the next thing I can do is just
bump<00:04:02.640> down<00:04:02.850> the<00:04:03.120> edge<00:04:03.299> or<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:04.049> shift<00:04:04.290> edge

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
bump down the edge or the shift edge

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.850 
bump down the edge or the shift edge
just<00:04:05.220> a<00:04:05.430> touch<00:04:05.670> and<00:04:06.060> I<00:04:06.780> think<00:04:07.230> that's<00:04:07.500> going<00:04:07.769> to

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
just a touch and I think that's going to

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.410 
just a touch and I think that's going to
do<00:04:08.100> it<00:04:08.250> now<00:04:08.400> you<00:04:08.459> can<00:04:08.610> probably<00:04:08.790> still<00:04:09.120> see

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
do it now you can probably still see

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.420 
do it now you can probably still see
some<00:04:09.660> gray<00:04:09.900> in<00:04:10.079> there<00:04:10.290> but<00:04:10.500> again<00:04:10.590> you're

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
some gray in there but again you're

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.800 
some gray in there but again you're
looking<00:04:11.940> at<00:04:12.090> it<00:04:12.269> now

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
looking at it now

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.120 
looking at it now
because<00:04:13.019> you<00:04:13.110> remember<00:04:13.350> the<00:04:13.590> gray<00:04:13.739> was<00:04:13.920> there

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
because you remember the gray was there

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.460 
because you remember the gray was there
and<00:04:14.340> you're<00:04:14.459> also<00:04:14.579> looking<00:04:14.730> at<00:04:15.209> it<00:04:15.360> on<00:04:15.480> a<00:04:16.169> black

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
and you're also looking at it on a black

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.319 
and you're also looking at it on a black
background<00:04:16.680> but<00:04:17.070> keep<00:04:17.280> in<00:04:17.430> mind<00:04:17.459> where<00:04:18.120> this

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
background but keep in mind where this

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.479 
background but keep in mind where this
is<00:04:18.510> going<00:04:18.870> so<00:04:19.049> now<00:04:19.709> I've<00:04:19.890> got<00:04:20.070> it<00:04:20.220> set<00:04:20.459> to

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
is going so now I've got it set to

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.610 
is going so now I've got it set to
output<00:04:21.000> this<00:04:21.150> as<00:04:21.359> a<00:04:21.390> new<00:04:21.630> layer<00:04:21.870> in<00:04:22.080> layer<00:04:22.260> mask

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
output this as a new layer in layer mask

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.110 
output this as a new layer in layer mask
which<00:04:22.860> is<00:04:22.890> going<00:04:23.220> to<00:04:23.310> be<00:04:23.400> the<00:04:23.550> default<00:04:23.940> when

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
which is going to be the default when

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.270 
which is going to be the default when
you<00:04:24.150> choose<00:04:24.450> decontaminate<00:04:25.200> colors<00:04:25.380> we'll<00:04:26.099> do

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
you choose decontaminate colors we'll do

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.480 
you choose decontaminate colors we'll do
click<00:04:26.460> okay<00:04:26.850> now<00:04:26.880> and<00:04:27.389> guess<00:04:28.110> what<00:04:28.410> as<00:04:29.040> soon<00:04:29.340> as

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
click okay now and guess what as soon as

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.160 
click okay now and guess what as soon as
it<00:04:29.610> outputs<00:04:29.970> that<00:04:30.060> layer<00:04:30.420> we're<00:04:30.810> good<00:04:30.990> to<00:04:31.139> go

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
it outputs that layer we're good to go

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.140 
it outputs that layer we're good to go
so<00:04:31.590> now<00:04:32.070> we'll<00:04:32.280> just<00:04:32.310> go<00:04:32.520> ahead<00:04:32.639> and<00:04:32.730> zoom<00:04:32.910> in

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
so now we'll just go ahead and zoom in

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:34.820 
so now we'll just go ahead and zoom in
on<00:04:33.240> it<00:04:33.420> so<00:04:33.570> you<00:04:33.630> can<00:04:33.780> really<00:04:33.900> examine<00:04:34.560> it<00:04:34.710> and

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
on it so you can really examine it and

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.480 
on it so you can really examine it and
look<00:04:35.550> at<00:04:35.639> the<00:04:35.790> job<00:04:36.030> it<00:04:36.300> did<00:04:36.830> fantastic<00:04:37.830> job<00:04:38.160> on

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
look at the job it did fantastic job on

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.420 
look at the job it did fantastic job on
the<00:04:39.150> hair<00:04:39.450> and<00:04:39.480> the<00:04:39.960> edges<00:04:40.500> around<00:04:40.650> that<00:04:41.100> image

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
the hair and the edges around that image

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.780 
the hair and the edges around that image
that<00:04:42.030> were<00:04:42.210> just<00:04:42.600> no<00:04:43.200> way<00:04:43.440> to<00:04:43.470> do<00:04:43.830> it<00:04:44.010> that<00:04:44.160> fast

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
that were just no way to do it that fast

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.970 
that were just no way to do it that fast
with<00:04:45.360> any<00:04:45.630> other<00:04:45.900> tool<00:04:46.169> or<00:04:46.440> method<00:04:46.830> you've

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
with any other tool or method you've

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.070 
with any other tool or method you've
been<00:04:47.160> doing<00:04:47.430> before<00:04:47.580> so<00:04:48.480> again<00:04:48.750> that's<00:04:48.900> a

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
been doing before so again that's a

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.920 
been doing before so again that's a
quick<00:04:49.260> look<00:04:49.320> at<00:04:49.680> photoshop<00:04:50.250> cs5<00:04:50.820> the<00:04:51.540> new<00:04:51.690> edge

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930

quick look at photoshop cs5 the new edge
detection<00:04:52.530> feature<00:04:52.950> when<00:04:53.550> you<00:04:53.639> make<00:04:53.820> a

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
detection feature when you make a

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.909 
detection feature when you make a
selection<00:04:54.270> just<00:04:54.780> to<00:04:54.960> just<00:04:55.590> choose<00:04:55.770> your

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 
selection just to just choose your

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:58.610 
selection just to just choose your
refine<00:04:56.340> edge<00:04:56.760> command<00:04:57.570> and<00:04:57.780> you<00:04:57.930> can<00:04:58.080> jump<00:04:58.380> in

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
refine edge command and you can jump in

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.080 
refine edge command and you can jump in
and<00:04:58.800> start<00:04:59.040> to<00:04:59.190> do<00:04:59.310> this<00:04:59.490> there's<00:04:59.730> also<00:04:59.910> a

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
and start to do this there's also a

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.420 
and start to do this there's also a

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
refine mask command that does it
