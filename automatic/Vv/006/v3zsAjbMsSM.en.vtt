00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:09.530
 good to all I am stumble and we 

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:12.709
 we found top minecraft houses 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:18.500
 today we have the fund house the number 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:22.789
 3 place 3 like this house so the 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:25.550
 another seemed better because this is not a 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:29.509
 thing of the rest not the rest 6 goes up 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:32.809
 score but look at that that presents 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:34.510
 it's beautiful it's pretty well made 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:37.960
 to take this away from me 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.940
 and wait I have the volume I have there 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.129
 lobbys I think 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.430
 and I'm sorry it's always a bit weird and if 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:48.579
 is that I'm not bad but I'm a 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:52.030
 little overwhelmed by the theme of youtube 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:54.079
 quiet is studies I usually think that 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.820
 I have the sound 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.820
 let's start it's worth here 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.890
 house created by a hydra 44 for the 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.260
 home contest of trontza 1 I hope that 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.390
 Argentine pleases them is not worth 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.310
 could record with me my son that is going 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.000
 to give a voice note for today what 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:17.060
 I'm sorry for not 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.530
 all this is worth yes for not going I'm going to 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.530
 leave a moment of time about ten 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.480
 seconds, then, is it worth it when I go to 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.120
 upload this video this one 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.400
 hello I'm an idea 44 thank you very much 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.600
 doctor for including me in this top and 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.600
 I hope you like the house 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.840
 if you pass an annotation they will say it if I do not 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.260
 They have not heard anything like this 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.260
 that we follow 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.429
 that goes up a lot of score I like 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:54.460
 it's a structure but they are things that 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.680
 that go up let's see the farm so what 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.840
 has everything prepared and has nothing 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:03.469
 pork the duck paradise does not count 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.859
 you see here a normal farm this normal 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:09.050
 not a pretty organized thing not a 

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:11.840
 thing out there disorganized not quite 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:15.980
 organized but that yes nothing that yes nothing 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.780
 of pistons remains worth I think that the 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.400
 previous house and this one are very tied 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:24.000
 it's worth less than it's simply earned 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:27.300
 because of the impact it gives, that's why 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.700
 well we enter music and the 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:34.159
 pretty generous door too 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:37.310
 but good to also look at what 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:40.580
 ornaments is not a very spacious house 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:43.590
 it's good it's beautiful but it has many 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:46.440
 ornaments are worth lamps 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.800
 with the posters 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.270
 and well 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.360
 we are going to do of days that is made of 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.560
 night 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.560
 It also has a fridge 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.570
 do not let it eat but well let's leave 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:05.160
 here has ovens have nothing worth 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:08.690
 but this is here and there is common 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.240
 rod imagine the bar 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.280
 and here we have what it comes to be 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.890
 the seats that do not very well 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.370
 I do not know how to have the micro and I talked to you 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.299
 a few days 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.299
 here a 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.810
 the music protection I forget the 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:28.780
 name of I feel that I play in English you 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.840
 What do you think that's wrong, but let's go 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.790
 here and let's go now up it's worth like 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.250
 you see what the bad thing about this house is this 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.579
 how do you get in here to see how it goes 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:42.299
 good it can come out really do not 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:42.299
 it is the same 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:48.440
 here we have boats with which we can 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:51.830
 catch them here fishing rods 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:55.819
 what we can ride, go but 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:57.769
 some boats are like uploads 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:01.530
 but good is to push push to push 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:03.750
 salt and salt out and out 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.860
 and with the sales you crash does what 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:09.010
 you want 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.880
 we go up it 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.510
 we go through again 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:18.859
 at the moment it's pretty good 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:22.560
 this is also well worth it and this 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:24.330
 plant has a bookstore 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.340
 well let's put music now that 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.630
 I say let's put music for this house 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.249
 let's put this cd 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:34.609
 it is not zero 

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:36.879
 there was another very similar so it would be 

00:04:34.609 --> 00:04:36.879
 this 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:40.299
 of this same 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:47.760
 Lovely views this house the beach 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:50.280
 from here so I encourage you to 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.270
 you play a survival with this map what 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.270
 I feel if this is too high 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.170
 biden 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:01.540
 I'm sorry for the previous cut I've 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.650
 had to do one thing not if it has 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:07.449
 changed the voice 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.449
 so well we keep going again 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:13.260
 pretty pretty 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.920
 let's see what function we have left 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.920
 our things 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:26.800
 Well, if a pretty good function 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:29.610
 a weapon that if you are near you choose everything 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.110
 so good 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.139
 I'm sorry if I'm doing my 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:37.820
 serious solution and I'm very sorry 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:42.860
 I love it so music is 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:44.980
 a good composer of 416 I think it's 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.980
 A) Yes 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:52.690
 to see here once he sings and 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.789
 we went up to the tower that views 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:57.370
 precious the house as I have told you is 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:59.050
 pretty good uses new materials 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.870
 as you see the previous one I also used it 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.919
 previous I used this and I used it in the 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.020
 farm nothing more 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:07.509
 the best thing was doing the house and you were 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:10.150
 We update puts the good will 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:14.139
 come down but in a very special way 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:17.159
 as how are we going to go down like 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:17.159
 for the trampoline 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:23.270
 as well 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.660
 one thing that my son dries is that the 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:27.660
 last houses and it's true 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:31.560
 do not exploit them 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:34.290
 and is that they really deserve it I do not know 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:36.270
 what face these houses do not know no 

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:39.350
 it does not give me so that these few 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:42.650
 explode exploded is the last of all 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:45.500
 the 1st that these last two houses are going 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:49.480
 to surprise we will be surprised 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:52.390
 thing because you 

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:54.070
 when you see something you are going to think 

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:55.680
 then who will first perform with 

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:57.280
 the intrigue is a pretty good house 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.080
 OK 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.600
 these are pretty good but if these 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.750
 you already say they are has a quality 

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:06.980
 Excellent 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:09.170
 expected from the others 

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:12.980
 like it now, if you have 

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:14.930
 liked the house very much 

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:17.560
 is fired transit 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:17.560
 goodbye
