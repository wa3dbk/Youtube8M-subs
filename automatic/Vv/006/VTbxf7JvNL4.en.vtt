different<00:00:25.500> in<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.710> corners<00:00:26.070> well<00:00:26.789> it

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
different in the corners well it

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.029 
different in the corners well it
actually<00:00:27.240> has<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:28.019> do<00:00:28.170> with<00:00:28.349> something<00:00:28.800> called

actually has to do with something called

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.040 
actually has to do with something called
the<00:00:29.130> differential<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.060> thing<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:30.810> allows

and knowing when to brake and accelerate
let's<00:00:58.289> go<00:00:58.500> for<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.739> spin<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.370> I'll<00:00:59.879> show<00:01:00.210> you

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
let's go for a spin and I'll show you

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.900 
let's go for a spin and I'll show you
how<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.629> corner<00:01:01.109> like<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.289> pro<00:01:01.649> see<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.550> corner

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
how to corner like a pro see that corner

how to corner like a pro see that corner
up<00:01:03.059> ahead<00:01:03.359> we're<00:01:04.170> going<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.589> flatten<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.100> out

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
up ahead we're going to flatten it out

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.310 
up ahead we're going to flatten it out
by<00:01:05.460> taking<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:05.970> with<00:01:06.119> an<00:01:06.240> outside<00:01:06.720> inside

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
by taking it with an outside inside

by taking it with an outside inside
outside<00:01:07.560> pattern<00:01:08.490> we're<00:01:09.119> going<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.540> approach

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
outside pattern we're going to approach

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.289 
outside pattern we're going to approach
it<00:01:10.080> at<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.290> comfortable<00:01:10.799> speed<00:01:10.950> not<00:01:11.820> too<00:01:12.030> fast

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
it at a comfortable speed not too fast

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.690 
it at a comfortable speed not too fast
we<00:01:13.049> need<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.260> be<00:01:13.500> able<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.890> accelerate<00:01:14.250> once

we need to be able to accelerate once

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.149 
we need to be able to accelerate once
we're<00:01:14.909> into<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.330> curve<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.930> if<00:01:16.590> we<00:01:16.710> brake<00:01:16.979> too

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
we're into the curve and if we brake too

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.060 
we're into the curve and if we brake too
hard<00:01:17.430> or<00:01:17.729> go<00:01:18.000> into<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.420> too<00:01:18.600> slow<00:01:18.900> we<00:01:19.740> will<00:01:19.950> be

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
hard or go into it too slow we will be

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.429 
hard or go into it too slow we will be
fighting<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.490> cart<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.030> may<00:01:21.900> hit<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.229> wall

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
fighting the cart and may hit the wall

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.560 
fighting the cart and may hit the wall
boom<00:01:23.070> like<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:24.290> okay<00:01:25.290> let's<00:01:26.130> try<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.400> again

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
boom like that okay let's try that again

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.179 
boom like that okay let's try that again
approaching<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.869> corner<00:01:28.290> at<00:01:28.439> good<00:01:28.799> speed

will<00:01:39.420> help<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.750> rear<00:01:39.960> wheels<00:01:40.290> slide<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.950> little

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
will help the rear wheels slide a little

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.819 
will help the rear wheels slide a little
more<00:01:41.490> turn<00:01:41.939> swiftly<00:01:42.540> but<00:01:42.930> smoothly<00:01:43.380> without

onto them slowly don't slam on them or

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.859 
onto them slowly don't slam on them or
you're<00:01:53.549> going<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.970> end<00:01:54.180> up<00:01:54.329> in<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.630> wall

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
you're going to end up in that wall

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.770 
you're going to end up in that wall
again<00:01:55.049> see<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.670> work<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.119> corner<00:01:57.180> with
