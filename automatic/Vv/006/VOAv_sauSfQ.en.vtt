00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:09.640 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:22.160 

you

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.580 

verica<00:00:23.170> about<00:00:23.980> five<00:00:24.490> years<00:00:24.700> ago<00:00:24.850> I<00:00:25.590> didn't

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
verica about five years ago I didn't

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.400 
verica about five years ago I didn't
really<00:00:26.830> speak<00:00:27.040> English<00:00:27.430> or<00:00:27.700> not<00:00:28.599> even<00:00:28.840> at<00:00:28.930> work

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.729 

I<00:00:33.150> thought<00:00:34.150> that<00:00:34.300> maybe<00:00:34.480> having<00:00:35.020> a<00:00:35.110> GED<00:00:35.500> was

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739 
I thought that maybe having a GED was

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.160 
I thought that maybe having a GED was
lesser<00:00:36.280> of<00:00:37.120> having<00:00:37.540> a<00:00:37.630> high<00:00:37.750> school<00:00:38.020> diploma

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
lesser of having a high school diploma

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.020 
lesser of having a high school diploma
when<00:00:38.680> really<00:00:38.890> it's<00:00:39.130> just<00:00:39.309> an<00:00:39.489> equivalent<00:00:39.940> it

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
when really it's just an equivalent it

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.570 
when really it's just an equivalent it
doesn't<00:00:40.329> matter<00:00:40.480> what<00:00:41.290> you<00:00:41.890> it's<00:00:42.250> not<00:00:42.370> it

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:42.580 
doesn't matter what you it's not it

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.369 
doesn't matter what you it's not it

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379 
doesn't matter where you've come from it

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:46.650
