00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
2d cells and it's the LED version so I

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.370 
2d cells and it's the LED version so I
figured<00:00:21.420> I'd<00:00:21.510> give<00:00:21.660> it<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.840> try

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
batteries I thought maybe these might

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.320 
batteries I thought maybe these might
have<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.720> batteries<00:01:07.080> inside<00:01:07.229> them<00:01:07.850> but<00:01:08.850> no<00:01:09.060> um

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
have the batteries inside them but no um

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.200 
have the batteries inside them but no um
I<00:01:09.750> guess<00:01:10.110> they're<00:01:10.290> pretty<00:01:10.470> proud<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.280> I

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
I guess they're pretty proud of it so I

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.380 
I guess they're pretty proud of it so I
went<00:01:12.450> through<00:01:12.510> my<00:01:13.229> battery<00:01:14.070> box<00:01:14.400> which<00:01:14.790> I

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
went through my battery box which I

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.690 
went through my battery box which I
think<00:01:16.350> most<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.770> us<00:01:16.920> have<00:01:18.890> vodka<00:01:19.890> looks<00:01:20.490> like
