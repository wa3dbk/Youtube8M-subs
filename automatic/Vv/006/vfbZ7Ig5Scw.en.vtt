00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
probably a draw was a fair result we

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.830 
probably a draw was a fair result we
should<00:03:31.920> have<00:03:32.040> beat<00:03:32.160> them<00:03:32.310> at<00:03:32.430> home<00:03:32.609> and<00:03:33.090> we<00:03:33.450> got

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
the result in started which I thought we

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.280 
the result in started which I thought we
after<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.030> second<00:03:36.359> half<00:03:36.480> anyway<00:03:36.720> with

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.309 
just to point us in the right direction
a<00:03:44.340> half<00:03:44.549> time<00:03:44.849> what<00:03:45.120> we<00:03:45.239> what<00:03:45.959> we<00:03:45.989> weren't

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
a half time what we what we weren't

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:47.629 
a half time what we what we weren't
doing<00:03:46.620> and<00:03:46.919> what<00:03:47.040> we<00:03:47.130> should<00:03:47.370> have<00:03:47.400> been<00:03:47.489> doing

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
doing and what we should have been doing

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:51.589 
doing and what we should have been doing
and<00:03:48.260> the<00:03:49.260> players<00:03:49.530> carried<00:03:50.459> it<00:03:50.579> out<00:03:50.700> perfectly

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
and the players carried it out perfectly

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.900 
and the players carried it out perfectly
in<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:51.810> second<00:03:52.169> half<00:03:52.319> and<00:03:52.590> I<00:03:52.769> thought<00:03:53.549> in<00:03:53.760> the

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
in the second half and I thought in the

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.620 
in the second half and I thought in the
end<00:03:54.079> you<00:03:55.079> know<00:03:55.109> we<00:03:55.430> totally<00:03:56.450> control<00:03:57.450> the

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
end you know we totally control the

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.140 
end you know we totally control the
second<00:03:58.019> half<00:03:58.139> and<00:03:58.639> from<00:03:59.639> that<00:03:59.760> point<00:03:59.819> of<00:04:00.090> view

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
second half and from that point of view

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.000 
second half and from that point of view
i<00:04:00.299> was<00:04:00.510> i<00:04:00.660> was<00:04:00.840> really<00:04:01.169> pleased<00:04:01.500> it<00:04:01.859> was<00:04:01.980> a

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
i was i was really pleased it was a

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.830 
i was i was really pleased it was a
performance<00:04:02.389> synonymous<00:04:03.389> with<00:04:03.510> the<00:04:03.569> team

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
performance synonymous with the team

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.300 
performance synonymous with the team
that's<00:04:04.169> got<00:04:04.319> a<00:04:04.380> lot<00:04:04.560> of<00:04:04.590> belief<00:04:04.829> in<00:04:05.010> a<00:04:05.099> lot<00:04:05.250> of

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
thought the lads at the back on Saturday

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:25.890 
thought the lads at the back on Saturday
were<00:04:23.219> great<00:04:23.909> I<00:04:24.180> thought<00:04:24.840> they

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
were great I thought they

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.170 
were great I thought they
they<00:04:26.080> snuffed<00:04:26.350> out<00:04:26.530> there<00:04:26.889> their<00:04:27.460> threats<00:04:27.790> in

they snuffed out there their threats in
the<00:04:28.270> game<00:04:28.300> I<00:04:28.690> thought<00:04:29.290> they<00:04:29.440> looked<00:04:29.620> really

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
the game I thought they looked really

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.640 
the game I thought they looked really
accomplished<00:04:30.580> in<00:04:31.060> and<00:04:31.300> assured<00:04:31.780> of<00:04:32.020> the<00:04:32.440> job

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
accomplished in and assured of the job

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.469 
accomplished in and assured of the job
that<00:04:32.680> they<00:04:32.860> were<00:04:33.070> doing<00:04:33.250> which<00:04:34.000> give<00:04:34.270> us<00:04:34.300> a

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
that they were doing which give us a

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:36.930 
that they were doing which give us a
chance<00:04:34.810> to<00:04:35.020> maybe<00:04:35.979> not<00:04:36.250> hit<00:04:36.400> that<00:04:36.550> hit<00:04:36.820> the

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
chance to maybe not hit that hit the

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.150 
chance to maybe not hit that hit the
heights<00:04:37.150> in<00:04:37.360> the<00:04:37.449> first<00:04:37.690> off<00:04:37.960> I<00:04:38.289> just<00:04:39.009> thought

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
heights in the first off I just thought

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.090 
heights in the first off I just thought
we<00:04:39.370> with<00:04:39.669> up<00:04:39.910> our<00:04:40.750> use<00:04:41.320> of<00:04:41.350> the<00:04:41.560> ball<00:04:41.740> should

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
we with up our use of the ball should

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.439 
we with up our use of the ball should
have<00:04:42.160> been<00:04:42.310> better<00:04:42.610> I<00:04:42.759> thought<00:04:43.030> we<00:04:43.150> didn't<00:04:43.330> win

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:43.449 
have been better I thought we didn't win

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:46.020 
have been better I thought we didn't win
enough<00:04:43.630> second<00:04:44.020> balls<00:04:44.199> I<00:04:44.580> thought<00:04:45.580> we<00:04:45.759> didn't

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
enough second balls I thought we didn't

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.900 
enough second balls I thought we didn't
get<00:04:46.090> any<00:04:46.360> areas<00:04:46.660> that<00:04:46.720> we<00:04:46.900> spoke<00:04:47.139> about<00:04:47.910> to

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
get any areas that we spoke about to

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.200 
get any areas that we spoke about to
hear<00:04:49.150> them<00:04:49.419> enough<00:04:50.259> and<00:04:50.620> I<00:04:51.400> think<00:04:51.639> our<00:04:51.789> overall

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
hear them enough and I think our overall

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.159 
hear them enough and I think our overall
in<00:04:52.449> core<00:04:52.630> plate<00:04:53.009> just<00:04:54.840> didn't<00:04:55.840> give<00:04:55.990> us<00:04:56.139> a

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
in core plate just didn't give us a

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:58.770 
in core plate just didn't give us a
chance<00:04:56.259> to<00:04:56.919> get<00:04:57.580> a<00:04:57.610> foothold<00:04:57.850> in<00:04:58.180> the<00:04:58.270> game<00:04:58.449> it

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
chance to get a foothold in the game it

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.330 
chance to get a foothold in the game it
broke<00:04:58.990> down<00:04:59.020> too<00:04:59.380> easy<00:04:59.590> and<00:04:59.740> then<00:04:59.860> second<00:05:00.190> half

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
broke down too easy and then second half

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.480 
broke down too easy and then second half
I<00:05:00.430> thought<00:05:00.610> we<00:05:00.760> were<00:05:01.180> different<00:05:01.389> in<00:05:02.310> they<00:05:03.310> need

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
I thought we were different in they need

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.820 
I thought we were different in they need
to<00:05:03.610> keep<00:05:03.760> working<00:05:03.820> hard<00:05:04.300> you<00:05:04.570> know<00:05:05.530> in<00:05:05.710> order

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
to keep working hard you know in order

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.900 
to keep working hard you know in order
to<00:05:05.979> just<00:05:06.490> to<00:05:06.820> stay<00:05:07.500> where<00:05:08.500> we<00:05:08.710> are<00:05:08.740> and<00:05:08.919> keep

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
to just to stay where we are and keep

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.390 
to just to stay where we are and keep
moving<00:05:10.180> upwards<00:05:10.750> and<00:05:11.080> keep<00:05:11.979> pulling<00:05:12.310> away

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
moving upwards and keep pulling away

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.909 
moving upwards and keep pulling away
from<00:05:12.490> the<00:05:12.669> team's<00:05:12.940> behind<00:05:13.120> us<00:05:13.620> as<00:05:14.620> I've<00:05:14.889> said

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
doing what to do it keep getting results

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.700 
doing what to do it keep getting results
that<00:05:23.800> they've<00:05:23.919> been<00:05:24.070> getting<00:05:24.310> recently<00:05:24.789> then

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
that they've been getting recently then

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.670 
that they've been getting recently then
that's<00:05:26.710> the<00:05:26.889> way<00:05:26.919> to<00:05:27.039> do<00:05:27.280> it<00:05:28.680> obviously

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
that's the way to do it obviously

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.200 
that's the way to do it obviously
everything<00:05:30.280> else<00:05:30.520> to<00:05:30.610> take<00:05:30.760> care<00:05:30.820> of<00:05:31.000> itself

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
everything else to take care of itself

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.080 
everything else to take care of itself
but<00:05:31.479> we<00:05:32.260> need<00:05:32.650> to<00:05:32.770> keep<00:05:32.949> focusing<00:05:33.400> on<00:05:33.550> on<00:05:33.760> what

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
but we need to keep focusing on on what

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.879 
but we need to keep focusing on on what
we're<00:05:34.300> doing<00:05:34.330> not<00:05:35.229> worrying<00:05:35.530> about<00:05:35.590> what

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:35.889 
we're doing not worrying about what

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:37.800 
we're doing not worrying about what
other<00:05:36.039> teams<00:05:36.250> around<00:05:36.580> us<00:05:36.760> are<00:05:36.849> doing<00:05:36.910> and<00:05:37.300> if

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 
other teams around us are doing and if

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.080 
other teams around us are doing and if
