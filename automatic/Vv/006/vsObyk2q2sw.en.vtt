00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.860
 now welcome I will explain how it 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.780
 makes a basketball tray what 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.810
 it is still a noble entrance 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.720
 jack in English 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:23.000
 and 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.000
 the movement is simple 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:31.099
 first the foot with which the foot goes 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.750
 of the hand with which you are going to launch is 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:38.800
 which is positioned first second 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.660
 the other foot and then the hand with which 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.020
 you are going to throw is the one of the foot that is 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.020
 raise 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.680
 the important thing is to be as close to 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.570
 the basket possible when you do this 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.770
 movement to leave the ball as 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.770
 close to the hoop 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.080
 then we repeat is 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:03.610
 this is the movement 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.650
 OK 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.340
 you can take two steps in basketball without 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.290
 that the trays are the most 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.880
 simple the good basketball is complex 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.640
 at the time of doing it but ensures a 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:19.240
 easy basket because you leave the ball what 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.490
 closer to the hoop are usually athletes who 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.890
 they have high performance or they have 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.010
 a lot of athletic ability to accompany him 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.620
 a mate is worth it but we as not 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.420
 we have that we accompany it to leave it 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.750
 farther the closest to the hoop that 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.750
 we can 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.820
 well I hope you liked this 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.720
 tutorial and I encourage you I feel that is the 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.720
 best sport in the world
