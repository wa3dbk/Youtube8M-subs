00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:10.099
 it's so I hope you're super good I'm 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.590
 happy to be another Friday with you 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:13.940
 thank you very much for joining me on 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.100
 today I bring you something that I know that 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.830
 can be very useful for many of 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.359
 you and I already know that the majority 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.890
 that was in this video has happened to them 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:24.050
 that we go to beauty salons and 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.539
 we say cut only the little tips 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.070
 and we came out with a princely hair 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.680
 brave the truth I've had a 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.629
 lot of bad experiences so 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.180
 For quite some time now I said I'm going to 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:37.129
 give me the task of looking to see if I can 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.260
 get a method to cut me the 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.780
 layered hair that was like me what 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.729
 I asked at home and I found this 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.350
 method that I loved and is super 

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:47.809
 simple the truth I did not have any 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.339
 preparation and study on hair and 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.620
 cutting my hair does not cost me anything 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:53.839
 You can choose if I want short layers 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.179
 long or medium and I love my 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:58.249
 hair and from now on I decide how much 

00:00:56.179 --> 00:01:00.260
 cut so if you want to try 

00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:02.959
 how to cut your hair at home 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.490
 I recommend that you watch this video and 

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:10.119
 we will only need a brush 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.860
 a league and scissors if you do not have 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.689
 special scissors for cutting 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.980
 hair I recommend it to be some 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:18.370
 very sharp scissors 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:22.360
 the first step to untangle 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.360
 perfectly our hair 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.509
 since our fingers can slide 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.490
 perfectly in our hair without 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.789
 get stuck it's time to give the next 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.789
 He passed 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.200
 and we make ponytails or ponytail and 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.960
 do not worry this does not have to be 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.570
 perfect but the part where you put it 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.900
 it will be depending where you are going to have your 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:04.810
 layers if you put it down its layers 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:07.810
 will be long if you put it in the part 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.660
 half of your head you will have some layers 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.690
 medium and if you put it very high you'll have 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.240
 short layers in this case I chose 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.460
 a few medium layers and since we have 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.590
 our ponytail and you make sure you 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.140
 that our hair will not get tangled if 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.810
 in the most important part that is to cut 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.000
 so the only thing we will do is that 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.850
 we will grab that ponytail that already 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.920
 we form and we will put it forward 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.990
 of our head is to say that the tail 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.990
 of horse touch our forehead 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.170
 and you do not have to pull the tail of 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.660
 horse just have it right 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.150
 subject and this is where we are going to calculate 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.670
 how much do we want to cut if you want 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.340
 only a blunt with a centimeter 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.740
 a centimeter and a half is enough and 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.780
 this time I did want to cut small and 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.690
 well the only thing we will do is grab 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:07.180
 our scissors secure with our 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.180
 fingers and cut straight 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.660
 you can comb your tail again 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:31.390
 horse and verify if the cut was 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.390
 even and if you can not re - match 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.150
 and it 's time to let go of your hair 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.150
 as 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:00.190
 you can see they have formed different 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:04.320
 layers in your hair in my case it 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.320
 They formed five layers 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.270
 well this was all for today's video 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.980
 the truth I hope you liked it and 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.290
 that which is heard as a risky means 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.330
 in this of cutting your own hair but 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.940
 the truth is a super simple method I 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.250
 no longer struggled more to cut more 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:52.070
 the hair I recommend to cut it a 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:54.380
 time every two months or so what you 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.600
 you need approximately one centimeter 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.370
 or one centimeter and a half I really do 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.500
 I cut more like he cut it because my 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.050
 Hair grows super fast once every 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.060
 two months and it's like being crazy giving 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.800
 to keep growing I explain that 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.810
 I have my hair I would love to see one 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.330
 picture on any of my social networks 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.670
 so for me it 's all and I'm not going 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.370
 without first inviting you to the draw 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:18.770
