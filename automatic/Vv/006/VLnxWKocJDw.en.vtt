00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.466
In this video, we'll be looking at how to quickly generate a crowd in Houdini.

00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:07.966
We're just going to make a new Shelf tab here, Crowds Shelf...

00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:11.366
and let's click on the Simulate Tool.

00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:14.766
Hit the Enter key twice - since we have an empty scene,

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.300
Houdini will generate a default setup for us!

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:23.333
So, our default crowd setup has 1000 agents, each agent has an 8000-poly count,

00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:27.799
and keep in mind that all the animation deformations are happening in real-time,

00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:31.199
none of it is pre-baked! Let's turn on Real Time Toggle, 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.966
and we're going to extend the timeline to 1000 frames. Click on Apply.

00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:48.466
Hit the UP arrow key to play.

00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:55.432
And we'll stop the playback and take a look at the network that was generated.

00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:01.299
The nodes have been colour-coded for our convenience.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.533
Pink ones are States and Behaviours.

00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:09.333
Orange are Trigger nodes. Blue are Transition nodes.

00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:13.866
The crowdsource node references the agent primitives, which are the guys we see in the scene,

00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:17.732
and the crowdsolver node, which implements the crowd system.

00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:21.733
You'll find control parameters for agents, avoidance, terrain and others!

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.433
Let's go back to frame one.

00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:28.866
And we'll go back up to object level. So, hit the U key...

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.800
and now hit the L key to layout the nodes, and we'll take a look at the nodes here.

00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:41.766
So here we have the mocap cycles for stand, rest and walk which our agent will use.

00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:48.899
And here is our bake cycle node, which bakes out the animation files to disk for performance purposes.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.400
crowd_sim is where we were looking at our nodal network earlier.

00:01:52.533 --> 00:01:59.899
And crowdsource, let's double click to go inside, is where we can specify controls for our agents.

00:02:01.666 --> 00:02:04.932
And we can, for example, set the number of agents.

00:02:04.933 --> 00:02:07.799
Let's make it 100.

00:02:09.033 --> 00:02:11.166
And we'll turn off the ortho grid...

00:02:11.166 --> 00:02:14.966
and we're going to change Layout to Formation.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.366
You can set the number of rows and columns you want.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.033
And you can adjust the amount of spacing as well.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.200
And let's play to see them move!

00:02:36.233 --> 00:02:39.966
Hit the up arrow key to toggle stop and we'll go back to frame one.

00:02:40.366 --> 00:02:43.266
We're going to click on the input of the crowdsource node,

00:02:43.266 --> 00:02:49.166
so hit the TAB key and type grid, and then hit the Enter key to select it.

00:02:49.166 --> 00:02:51.899
We're going to change the grid parameters.

00:02:52.933 --> 00:02:57.233
And we'll set the rows and columns to 20.

00:02:57.233 --> 00:03:00.066
And we're going to change Layout back to Random.

00:03:00.166 --> 00:03:07.999
And we're going to use a tool called Paint Density which will allow us to interactively place our agents by painting directly on our grid terrain

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.900
Make sure that our crowdsource object is selected... and then hit Enter!

00:03:13.066 --> 00:03:17.532
Hold down SHIFT and LMB click and drag to change the brush size...

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.133
And we can start painting...

00:03:23.466 --> 00:03:33.232
Changing the foreground colour values will affect the density of agents distributed on our grid...

00:03:35.266 --> 00:03:39.966
And we're done painting. So let's go back up to object level. Hit the U key.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.100
And we'll play it back to see our crowd take a stroll!

00:03:49.933 --> 00:03:53.833
And this is just an example of some of the Crowd Shelf tools inside Houdini

00:03:54.066 --> 00:03:57.532
Stay tuned for more in future videos!
