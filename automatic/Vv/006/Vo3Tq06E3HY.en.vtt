and then underneath is to deploy this

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.550 
and then underneath is to deploy this
printer<00:03:24.030> connection<00:03:24.420> to<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.600> following<00:03:24.959> the

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
or the computers or both now in the past

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.670 
or the computers or both now in the past
I've<00:03:32.069> always<00:03:32.370> done<00:03:32.489> it<00:03:32.579> per<00:03:32.790> user<00:03:33.500> because<00:03:34.500> it

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
I've always done it per user because it

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.000 
I've always done it per user because it
was<00:03:34.769> a<00:03:34.799> lot<00:03:35.040> easier<00:03:35.220> to<00:03:35.579> share<00:03:35.880> or<00:03:36.290> to<00:03:37.290> tie<00:03:37.980> a

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
was a lot easier to share or to tie a

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.879 
was a lot easier to share or to tie a
printer<00:03:38.609> to<00:03:38.790> deploy<00:03:39.120> a<00:03:39.150> printer<00:03:39.889> tcp/ip

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889

now<00:03:46.500> with<00:03:46.680> this<00:03:46.859> I<00:03:47.220> guess<00:03:47.790> there's<00:03:48.060> some<00:03:48.239> when

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
now with this I guess there's some when

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
now with this I guess there's some when
you<00:03:49.019> whenever<00:03:49.290> you<00:03:49.440> do<00:03:49.530> this<00:03:49.650> it<00:03:49.829> actually

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
you whenever you do this it actually

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.650 
you whenever you do this it actually
adds<00:03:50.280> other<00:03:50.579> things<00:03:50.940> to<00:03:51.209> the<00:03:51.329> group<00:03:51.480> policy

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
adds other things to the group policy

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.780 
adds other things to the group policy
but<00:03:52.139> let's<00:03:52.859> just<00:03:53.010> say<00:03:53.130> we<00:03:53.160> want<00:03:53.430> to<00:03:53.459> do<00:03:53.579> it<00:03:53.669> to

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
but let's just say we want to do it to

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.940 
but let's just say we want to do it to
both<00:03:53.940> the<00:03:54.120> user<00:03:54.900> and<00:03:55.019> machine<00:03:55.560> so<00:03:55.680> no<00:03:55.769> matter

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
both the user and machine so no matter

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.949 
both the user and machine so no matter
who<00:03:56.160> logs<00:03:56.400> in<00:03:56.609> or<00:03:56.940> or<00:03:58.790> or<00:03:59.790> what<00:04:00.359> computer<00:04:00.780> it<00:04:00.870> is

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
who logs in or or or what computer it is

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.839 
who logs in or or or what computer it is
anything<00:04:01.739> that's<00:04:01.950> under<00:04:02.220> here<00:04:02.519> is<00:04:02.639> going<00:04:02.790> to

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 
anything that's under here is going to

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:04.580 
anything that's under here is going to
have<00:04:03.000> these<00:04:03.150> printers<00:04:03.510> attached<00:04:04.079> to<00:04:04.290> it<00:04:04.380> so

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
have these printers attached to it so

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.270 
have these printers attached to it so
then<00:04:04.980> we're<00:04:05.069> going<00:04:05.190> to<00:04:05.250> go<00:04:05.340> ahead<00:04:05.430> and<00:04:05.669> add<00:04:06.540> and

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
to right-click and do deploy and after

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.720 
to right-click and do deploy and after
that<00:05:06.970> you'll<00:05:07.210> find<00:05:07.450> the<00:05:07.510> deployed<00:05:07.840> printers

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:08.730 
that you'll find the deployed printers

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.830 
that you'll find the deployed printers
so<00:05:09.730> okay<00:05:10.210> and<00:05:10.240> then<00:05:10.450> I'm<00:05:10.540> just<00:05:10.570> going<00:05:10.780> to

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
so okay and then I'm just going to

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.950 
so okay and then I'm just going to
remove<00:05:11.110> this<00:05:11.380> group<00:05:11.650> policy<00:05:12.390> because<00:05:13.390> I<00:05:13.750> don't

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
remove this group policy because I don't

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.470 
remove this group policy because I don't
need<00:05:14.140> it<00:05:14.230> anymore<00:05:14.440> and<00:05:14.950> it's<00:05:15.910> actually<00:05:16.300> going

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:16.480 
need it anymore and it's actually going

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.360 
need it anymore and it's actually going
to<00:05:16.570> stay<00:05:16.960> in<00:05:17.110> here<00:05:17.500> so<00:05:17.740> I<00:05:17.800> want<00:05:17.830> to<00:05:17.980> remove<00:05:18.220> it

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
to stay in here so I want to remove it

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.290 
to stay in here so I want to remove it
from<00:05:18.550> here<00:05:18.730> -<00:05:20.070> it<00:05:21.070> just<00:05:21.220> unlinked<00:05:22.060> it<00:05:22.150> when<00:05:22.270> I

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
from here - it just unlinked it when I

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.650 
from here - it just unlinked it when I
delete<00:05:22.600> it<00:05:22.660> from<00:05:22.810> that'll<00:05:23.080> you<00:05:23.230> but<00:05:23.980> and<00:05:24.660> as

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
delete it from that'll you but and as

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.950 
delete it from that'll you but and as
you<00:05:25.780> can<00:05:25.900> see<00:05:25.960> here<00:05:26.650> if<00:05:26.770> we<00:05:26.800> go<00:05:26.950> to<00:05:27.010> printers

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
you can see here if we go to printers

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:34.410 
you can see here if we go to printers
why<00:05:28.960> is<00:05:29.020> my<00:05:29.230> window<00:05:29.440> tiny<00:05:30.720> this<00:05:31.720> is<00:05:33.240> the<00:05:34.240> one

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:34.420 
why is my window tiny this is the one

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.480 
why is my window tiny this is the one
printer<00:05:34.750> and<00:05:34.900> this<00:05:35.320> is<00:05:35.500> the<00:05:35.650> other<00:05:36.160> printer

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
printer and this is the other printer

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.110 
printer and this is the other printer
and<00:05:36.670> the<00:05:36.970> cool<00:05:37.120> part<00:05:37.300> about<00:05:37.330> this<00:05:37.540> I<00:05:37.720> believe

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
and the cool part about this I believe

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.850 
and the cool part about this I believe
you<00:05:40.120> can<00:05:40.330> still<00:05:40.630> set<00:05:40.960> your<00:05:41.110> default<00:05:41.290> printer

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
you can still set your default printer

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.770 
you can still set your default printer
and<00:05:41.950> I<00:05:42.040> think<00:05:42.400> it<00:05:42.550> will<00:05:42.700> will<00:05:43.180> stay<00:05:43.450> when<00:05:43.690> you

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:43.780 
and I think it will will stay when you

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.530 
and I think it will will stay when you
restart<00:05:44.200> but<00:05:45.160> if<00:05:45.280> we<00:05:45.460> go<00:05:45.640> down<00:05:45.820> here<00:05:46.210> let's<00:05:46.390> go

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:46.540 
restart but if we go down here let's go

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:25.380 
dig around and find all those places so
it<00:06:23.290> makes<00:06:23.620> it<00:06:23.740> a<00:06:23.800> lot<00:06:23.890> easier<00:06:23.950> and<00:06:24.460> I've<00:06:24.850> we<00:06:25.240> use
