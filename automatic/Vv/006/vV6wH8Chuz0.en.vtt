00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
you guys that the easiest way to find a

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:18.620 
you guys that the easiest way to find a
slime<00:00:18.210> ball

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
slime ball

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.830 
slime ball
it's<00:00:18.840> basically<00:00:19.580> explore<00:00:20.580> bedrock<00:00:21.449> you'll

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
it's basically explore bedrock you'll

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.779 
it's basically explore bedrock you'll
find<00:00:22.140> slime<00:00:22.410> balls<00:00:22.619> at<00:00:22.830> least<00:00:23.010> five<00:00:23.250> levels

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
find slime balls at least five levels

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.810 
find slime balls at least five levels
above<00:00:24.090> bedrock<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:25.019> as<00:00:25.769> you<00:00:26.039> can<00:00:26.130> see<00:00:26.340> there's

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
above bedrock and as you can see there's

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.580 
above bedrock and as you can see there's
a<00:00:26.880> lot<00:00:27.060> of<00:00:27.150> tiny<00:00:27.330> little<00:00:27.570> slime<00:00:27.840> balls<00:00:28.080> they

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
a lot of tiny little slime balls they

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.410 
a lot of tiny little slime balls they
went<00:00:28.769> from<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:29.070> two<00:00:29.220> by<00:00:29.400> two<00:00:29.460> all<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.060> way<00:00:30.240> down

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
went from a two by two all the way down

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.590 
went from a two by two all the way down
to<00:00:30.570> one<00:00:30.869> by<00:00:31.050> one<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:31.920> if<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:32.700> if<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.270> ever<00:00:33.420> see

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
to one by one so if you if you ever see

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.630 
to one by one so if you if you ever see
a<00:00:33.630> large<00:00:34.260> slime<00:00:34.559> ball<00:00:34.829> you<00:00:35.040> want<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.309> see<00:00:35.460> the

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
a large slime ball you want to see the

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.190 
a large slime ball you want to see the
little<00:00:35.790> ones<00:00:36.030> all<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.540> have<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.719> do<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:37.020> shoot

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
little ones all you have to do is shoot

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.660 
little ones all you have to do is shoot
it<00:00:37.350> with<00:00:37.440> an<00:00:37.530> arrow<00:00:37.710> because<00:00:38.129> if<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.399> hit<00:00:38.520> with

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
it with an arrow because if you hit with

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.580 
it with an arrow because if you hit with
a<00:00:38.730> sword<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.120> doesn't<00:00:39.360> multiply<00:00:40.079> apparently

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
a sword it doesn't multiply apparently

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.840 
a sword it doesn't multiply apparently
so<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:40.829> have<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.129> keep<00:00:41.280> shooting<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:41.730> with<00:00:41.790> a

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
so you have to keep shooting it with a

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.850 
so you have to keep shooting it with a
bow<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.300> arrow<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.809> don't<00:00:43.260> have<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.500> get<00:00:43.649> little

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
bow and arrow I don't have to get little

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.740 
bow and arrow I don't have to get little
slime<00:00:44.100> balls<00:00:44.370> like<00:00:44.550> these<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:45.239> these<00:00:45.570> are

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
slime balls like these so these are

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.500 
slime balls like these so these are
really<00:00:46.079> harmless<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:47.280> don't<00:00:47.489> hurt<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:48.149> but

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
really harmless you don't hurt you but

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.389 
really harmless you don't hurt you but
they<00:00:48.600> just<00:00:48.629> keep<00:00:48.989> pushing<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:50.250> is

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
they just keep pushing you and this is

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.279 
they just keep pushing you and this is
where<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.670> gets<00:00:50.789> annoying<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.110> keep

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
where it gets annoying and I keep

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.810 
where it gets annoying and I keep
telling<00:00:52.559> my<00:00:52.620> friend<00:00:52.890> come<00:00:53.160> down<00:00:53.399> here<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.699> come

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
telling my friend come down here to come

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.299 
telling my friend come down here to come
down<00:00:54.059> here<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.539> hurry<00:00:55.079> up<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.559> get<00:00:55.680> over<00:00:55.739> here

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
down here and hurry up and get over here

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.830 
down here and hurry up and get over here
so<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.820> will<00:00:56.910> take<00:00:57.120> him<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.329> little<00:00:57.480> bit<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.809> a

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
so it will take him a little bit of a

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.930 
so it will take him a little bit of a
time<00:00:58.079> some<00:00:58.800> time<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:59.160> actually<00:00:59.250> get<00:00:59.520> over<00:00:59.550> here

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
time some time to actually get over here

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.939 
time some time to actually get over here
but<00:01:00.300> as<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.449> can<00:01:00.539> see<00:01:00.660> this<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.440> part<00:01:01.890> of

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
but as you can see this is part of

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.709 
but as you can see this is part of
operation<00:01:02.489> bedrock<00:01:03.000> as<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.300> guys<00:01:03.480> already

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
operation bedrock as you guys already

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.200 
operation bedrock as you guys already
know<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.229> look<00:01:04.619> how<00:01:04.769> long<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.610> tunnel<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.030> so

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
know and look how long the tunnel is so

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.690 
know and look how long the tunnel is so
far<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.630> we<00:01:06.750> built<00:01:07.080> so<00:01:07.650> we<00:01:08.310> are<00:01:08.400> at<00:01:08.490> bedrock

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
far that we built so we are at bedrock

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.030 
far that we built so we are at bedrock
level<00:01:09.060> we<00:01:09.390> are<00:01:09.420> expanding<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.350> tunnels<00:01:10.740> so

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
level we are expanding the tunnels so

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.560 
level we are expanding the tunnels so
this<00:01:11.250> is<00:01:11.430> like<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.640> little<00:01:11.939> bit<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.299> break

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
this is like a little bit of a break

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.539 
this is like a little bit of a break
from<00:01:12.869> operation<00:01:13.500> bedrock<00:01:13.860> but<00:01:14.250> at<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.400> same

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
from operation bedrock but at the same

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.580 
from operation bedrock but at the same
time<00:01:14.820> we<00:01:15.330> are<00:01:15.360> still<00:01:15.689> working<00:01:15.900> on<00:01:16.080> operation

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
time we are still working on operation

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.550 
time we are still working on operation
bedrock<00:01:16.979> don't<00:01:17.340> worry<00:01:17.520> about<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:18.060> so<00:01:19.020> here

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
bedrock don't worry about that so here

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.530 
bedrock don't worry about that so here
are<00:01:19.650> these<00:01:19.770> little<00:01:19.830> tiny<00:01:20.189> slime<00:01:20.490> balls<00:01:20.759> would

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
are these little tiny slime balls would

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.090 
are these little tiny slime balls would
I<00:01:21.780> don't<00:01:21.930> know<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.170> forgot<00:01:22.530> what<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.860> names

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
I don't know I forgot what the names

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.789 
I don't know I forgot what the names

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
actually around lava so you got to make

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.110 
actually around lava so you got to make
sure<00:02:18.600> that<00:02:18.960> you<00:02:19.530> just<00:02:19.860> don't<00:02:20.280> get<00:02:20.610> into<00:02:20.940> the

slime<00:03:01.500> balls<00:03:01.770> a<00:03:01.890> little<00:03:02.070> slimes<00:03:02.460> I<00:03:02.700> don't<00:03:02.820> know

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
slime balls a little slimes I don't know

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:03.500 
slime balls a little slimes I don't know
what<00:03:03.000> they're<00:03:03.120> called

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
and they do drop slime balls or whatever

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.540 
and they do drop slime balls or whatever
I<00:03:06.720> don't<00:03:06.930> know<00:03:06.990> what<00:03:07.080> to<00:03:07.170> call<00:03:07.440> on<00:03:07.680> us<00:03:07.710> and<00:03:08.040> no

all right you blow up all right look at
that<00:03:11.130> see<00:03:11.400> look<00:03:11.610> little<00:03:11.970> tiny<00:03:12.090> slime<00:03:12.360> balls<00:03:12.600> so

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
that see look little tiny slime balls so

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.470 
that see look little tiny slime balls so
these<00:03:14.100> things<00:03:14.340> actually<00:03:14.460> drop<00:03:15.090> them<00:03:15.360> if

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
these things actually drop them if

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.610 
these things actually drop them if
they're<00:03:15.630> the<00:03:15.780> ones<00:03:15.810> that<00:03:16.050> multiply<00:03:16.500> if

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
they're the ones that multiply if

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.620 
they're the ones that multiply if
there's<00:03:16.770> just<00:03:16.830> only<00:03:17.070> one<00:03:17.459> then<00:03:17.970> you<00:03:18.300> won't<00:03:18.450> get

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
there's just only one then you won't get

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.410 
there's just only one then you won't get
them<00:03:18.810> so<00:03:19.110> apparently<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.430> best<00:03:20.700> method<00:03:21.240> to

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
them so apparently the best method to

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.120 
them so apparently the best method to
actually<00:03:21.750> get<00:03:22.110> these<00:03:22.230> slime<00:03:22.500> balls<00:03:22.740> to

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
actually get these slime balls to

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.699 
actually get these slime balls to
multiply<00:03:23.640> and<00:03:23.910> get<00:03:24.150> slime<00:03:24.450> balls<00:03:24.690> is<00:03:25.080> to

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
multiply and get slime balls is to

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:26.810 
multiply and get slime balls is to
actually<00:03:25.890> shooting<00:03:26.190> with<00:03:26.370> bows<00:03:26.520> and<00:03:26.700> arrows

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
actually shooting with bows and arrows

00:04:28.239 --> 00:04:28.249 
oh I got a glitchy all right they're

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:29.469 
oh I got a glitchy all right they're
dead<00:04:28.460> they're<00:04:29.060> gone

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
there so I'm gonna jump over here

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.480 
there so I'm gonna jump over here
explore<00:04:36.020> a<00:04:36.050> little<00:04:36.289> bit<00:04:36.439> all<00:04:36.949> right

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
explore a little bit all right

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.399 
explore a little bit all right
OOP<00:04:37.879> there<00:04:37.939> he<00:04:38.240> is<00:04:38.360> the<00:04:38.749> big<00:04:38.930> one<00:04:39.169> right<00:04:39.199> there

00:04:39.399 --> 00:04:39.409 
OOP there he is the big one right there

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:44.200 
OOP there he is the big one right there
I<00:04:42.099> just<00:04:43.099> say<00:04:43.370> sign<00:04:43.669> for<00:04:43.879> you<00:04:43.939> so<00:04:44.029> I<00:04:44.060> could

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
I just say sign for you so I could

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.249 
I just say sign for you so I could
actually<00:04:44.300> hear<00:04:44.599> the<00:04:44.779> sound<00:04:44.810> that<00:04:45.169> they

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:45.259 
actually hear the sound that they

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:46.989 
actually hear the sound that they
actually<00:04:45.379> make<00:04:45.710> so<00:04:46.039> that's<00:04:46.610> how<00:04:46.789> you<00:04:46.849> could

00:04:46.989 --> 00:04:46.999 
actually make so that's how you could

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:48.879 
actually make so that's how you could
tell<00:04:47.060> that<00:04:47.300> it's<00:04:47.419> one<00:04:47.539> around<00:04:47.810> and<00:04:48.409> I<00:04:48.680> kept

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889 
tell that it's one around and I kept

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:49.839 
tell that it's one around and I kept
ringing<00:04:49.039> my<00:04:49.159> friend<00:04:49.370> because<00:04:49.490> he<00:04:49.580> kept<00:04:49.729> him

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:49.849 
ringing my friend because he kept him

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:51.040 
ringing my friend because he kept him
get<00:04:49.969> in<00:04:50.060> front<00:04:50.210> of<00:04:50.300> me<00:04:50.389> and<00:04:50.569> now<00:04:50.810> we're<00:04:50.900> gonna

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
get in front of me and now we're gonna

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.330 
get in front of me and now we're gonna
make<00:04:51.169> it<00:04:51.289> multiply<00:04:51.710> again<00:04:51.919> and<00:04:52.039> he<00:04:52.099> gets<00:04:52.249> in

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
make it multiply again and he gets in

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.489 
make it multiply again and he gets in
front<00:04:52.490> of<00:04:52.580> me<00:04:52.639> again<00:04:52.759> strong<00:04:53.599> kid<00:04:53.870> don't<00:04:54.349> get

00:04:54.489 --> 00:04:54.499 
front of me again strong kid don't get

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:55.629 
front of me again strong kid don't get
in<00:04:54.560> front<00:04:54.740> of<00:04:54.800> me<00:04:54.860> I'm<00:04:55.069> shooting<00:04:55.370> a<00:04:55.400> bow<00:04:55.550> and

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639 
in front of me I'm shooting a bow and

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:57.640 
in front of me I'm shooting a bow and
arrow<00:04:55.759> so<00:04:56.569> that's<00:04:57.110> how<00:04:57.229> you<00:04:57.289> make<00:04:57.379> him

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
arrow so that's how you make him

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.529 
arrow so that's how you make him
multiply<00:04:58.099> I<00:04:58.370> did<00:04:58.759> not<00:04:58.909> know<00:04:59.090> that<00:04:59.120> until<00:04:59.360> a

00:04:59.529 --> 00:04:59.539 
multiply I did not know that until a

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:01.839 
multiply I did not know that until a
while<00:04:59.719> until<00:05:00.349> peon<00:05:00.919> actually<00:05:01.310> told<00:05:01.460> me<00:05:01.550> it<00:05:01.729> you

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:01.849 
while until peon actually told me it you

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:03.459 
while until peon actually told me it you
have<00:05:01.939> to<00:05:02.029> shoot<00:05:02.180> with<00:05:02.330> a<00:05:02.389> bow<00:05:02.569> and<00:05:02.599> arrow<00:05:02.840> so

00:05:03.459 --> 00:05:03.469 
have to shoot with a bow and arrow so

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:05.529 
have to shoot with a bow and arrow so
that<00:05:03.710> if<00:05:04.279> you<00:05:04.460> want<00:05:04.610> them<00:05:04.759> to<00:05:04.849> multiply<00:05:05.300> that's

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:05.539 
that if you want them to multiply that's

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:07.839 
that if you want them to multiply that's
how<00:05:05.719> you<00:05:05.779> may<00:05:05.900> go<00:05:06.020> multiply<00:05:06.439> but<00:05:06.949> so<00:05:07.129> far<00:05:07.400> the

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:07.849 
how you may go multiply but so far the

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:08.950 
how you may go multiply but so far the
little<00:05:08.090> slime<00:05:08.330> balls<00:05:08.539> that<00:05:08.689> they<00:05:08.810> actually

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
little slime balls that they actually

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.379 
little slime balls that they actually
drop<00:05:09.319> they<00:05:09.710> are<00:05:09.860> a<00:05:09.889> have<00:05:10.219> they<00:05:10.520> have<00:05:10.729> no<00:05:11.120> use

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:11.389 
drop they are a have they have no use

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:13.689 
drop they are a have they have no use
whatsoever<00:05:11.629> until<00:05:12.319> we<00:05:12.919> have<00:05:13.069> the<00:05:13.189> Pistons

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:13.699 
whatsoever until we have the Pistons

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:15.459 
whatsoever until we have the Pistons
update<00:05:14.150> that's<00:05:14.629> when<00:05:14.840> they<00:05:14.960> will<00:05:15.110> become<00:05:15.289> more

00:05:15.459 --> 00:05:15.469 
update that's when they will become more

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:17.980 
update that's when they will become more
useful<00:05:16.099> until<00:05:16.729> then<00:05:17.000> if<00:05:17.330> you<00:05:17.539> want<00:05:17.719> to<00:05:17.779> collect

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
useful until then if you want to collect

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.869 
useful until then if you want to collect
some<00:05:18.110> slime<00:05:18.409> balls<00:05:18.650> this<00:05:19.069> is<00:05:19.129> how<00:05:19.430> you<00:05:19.490> do<00:05:19.699> it<00:05:19.849> I

00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:19.879 
some slime balls this is how you do it I

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:21.999 
some slime balls this is how you do it I
probably<00:05:20.389> could<00:05:20.629> call<00:05:20.810> this<00:05:20.930> a<00:05:21.080> guide<00:05:21.469> as<00:05:21.770> well

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:22.009

00:05:46.119 --> 00:05:46.129 
look another sign ball okay this is

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.869 
look another sign ball okay this is
funny

00:05:46.869 --> 00:05:46.879

they always spaz them everywhere
sometimes<00:05:49.129> he<00:05:49.189> came<00:05:49.310> to<00:05:49.430> tell<00:05:49.610> us<00:05:49.699> over<00:05:49.789> there

00:05:50.019 --> 00:05:50.029 
sometimes he came to tell us over there
