00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
don't actually click it just hover over

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.330 
don't actually click it just hover over
it<00:00:42.960> so<00:00:43.079> once<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.260> hover<00:00:43.410> over<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.800> back<00:00:44.100> out<00:00:44.280> of

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
it so once you hover over it back out of

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.190 
it so once you hover over it back out of
it<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.640> then<00:00:44.969> go<00:00:45.120> back<00:00:45.600> out<00:00:45.809> press<00:00:46.020> be<00:00:46.170> a

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
couple tons and go all the way down to

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.490 
couple tons and go all the way down to
wheels<00:00:48.570> now<00:00:48.870> when<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.020> go<00:00:49.110> down<00:00:49.230> two<00:00:49.320> wheels

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
wheels now when you go down two wheels

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.590 
wheels now when you go down two wheels
dependent<00:00:50.430> on<00:00:50.520> which<00:00:50.670> wheels<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.120> have<00:00:51.149> the

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
dependent on which wheels you have the

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.840 
dependent on which wheels you have the
pet<00:00:51.840> will<00:00:52.260> depend<00:00:52.590> on<00:00:52.739> how<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.010> do<00:00:53.280> this<00:00:53.579> part

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
pet will depend on how you do this part

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.880 
pet will depend on how you do this part
so<00:00:54.360> if<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.539> have<00:00:54.719> stock<00:00:55.199> wheels<00:00:55.410> already<00:00:55.800> on

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
so if you have stock wheels already on

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.830 
so if you have stock wheels already on
the<00:00:55.980> car<00:00:56.129> just<00:00:56.460> choose<00:00:56.820> custom<00:00:57.390> wheels<00:00:57.539> and

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
the car just choose custom wheels and

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.279 
the car just choose custom wheels and
then<00:00:58.320> go<00:00:58.440> back<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.649> respray<00:00:59.219> but<00:00:59.879> if<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.090> have

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 
then go back to respray but if you have

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:02.330 
then go back to respray but if you have
custom<00:01:01.289> wheels<00:01:01.440> just<00:01:01.710> go<00:01:01.829> back<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.100> stock

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
custom wheels just go back to stock

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.359 
custom wheels just go back to stock
wheels<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.910> then<00:01:03.600> go<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.320> respray<00:01:04.799> so<00:01:05.159> once

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
wheels and then go to respray so once

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.399 
wheels and then go to respray so once
you<00:01:05.489> do<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.670> once<00:01:06.540> you're<00:01:06.689> back<00:01:06.780> at<00:01:06.990> respray

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
you do that once you're back at respray

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.380 
you do that once you're back at respray
i'll<00:01:08.040> just<00:01:08.280> go<00:01:08.400> down<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.580> present<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.330> you

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
i'll just go down to present and you

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.370 
i'll just go down to present and you
should<00:01:09.570> be<00:01:09.659> able<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.900> put<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.080> pearlescent

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
should be able to put the pearlescent

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.200 
should be able to put the pearlescent
colors<00:01:10.770> on<00:01:10.890> assistance<00:01:11.369> it's<00:01:11.760> actually<00:01:12.000> a

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
colors on assistance it's actually a

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.020 
colors on assistance it's actually a
super<00:01:12.630> easy<00:01:12.780> glitch<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:14.100> it's<00:01:14.400> not<00:01:14.640> really

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
super easy glitch and it's not really

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.510
