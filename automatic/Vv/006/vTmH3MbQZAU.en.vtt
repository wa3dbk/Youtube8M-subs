Sweets Tales

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:14.000
Today's tale is of a steamed bun to enjoy while you unwind.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.000
Kagurazaka, Tokyo is a town of alleyways.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.100
Small roads intertwine as if to escape the hustle of the city.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.900
The back-alley beckon you deeper and deeper in.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:49.600
You arrive at Manju Cafe Mugimaru 2,
entangled in ivy.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.700
It's a small, curious space.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.400
Iwazaki-san, the owner,
makes steamed wheat buns.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.500
As a child, Iwazaki-san often ate them as snacks.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.500
Her family runs a sweets shop
and she learned to make them from her grandmother and mother.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.300
I get to eat something dear to me

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.000
while enjoying my time with everyone.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.600
Steamed for 7 minutes.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.600
Mix brown sugar,
mugwort or black tea leaves in the dough,

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.300
then fill with ingredients like red bean paste,
cheese or sweet potato paste.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.600
Iwazaki-san has been making steamed buns for 20 years.
Her family recipe is now complemented by 12 flavors.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.400
Decorating her shop are things recieved,

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.200
things made, things discovered.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.300
I like to nap here.
"In the store?"

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.300
It's very laid back.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.100
A place you can unwind as you like.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:26.100
It's like I made the perfect place for me,

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:33.100
and everyone has come to enjoy it with me.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.500
Night in the alley is lively with steamed wheat buns
as a snack.
