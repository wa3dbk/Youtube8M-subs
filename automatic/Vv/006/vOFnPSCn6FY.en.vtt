00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.600
What are you doing, "lord Bald"?

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.000
I'm reading, can't you see?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.400
Ahm, ok...

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.400
Got you...

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.400
What are you reading, "mister lord bald"?

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:43.600
The newspaper, stupid chicken! I`m reading the newspaper.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.400
And my name isn't "Lord Bald". My name is Doc Joaquim CurvedLeg!

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.100
Ah, ok...

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.000
– Ouch!
– Are you sure you're reading the news, "Lord Bald"?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.900
Ohh, get off me, fledgeling!

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.440
Oh, Holy saints...

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.600
...please give me patience!

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.700
Hey, "Bald Sir", did you know I also read the papers?

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.560
Oh, good for you, keep this way...

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.800
Thanks! I only read the comics, it's amazing!

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.910
– Do you read the comics too, "Mister Lord Bald Sir"?
– Can you please stop talking?

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.460
I want to read the news, but you're annoying me with this chat!

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.299
And I want to chat, but you're annoying me with this paper reading...

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.200
If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen!

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.600
But who started to complain was you!

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.010
Hey, "Lord Bald"!

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.519
what is it this time, you cockerel?

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.800
Nothing! It was just to know if you could listen to me!

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.169
What do you want?!

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:30.199
Wow!

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:33.100
What you lack in hair, left you in rude!

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.100
I just wanted to know what time is it!

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.049
What are you doing, sir?

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:44.000
I'm reading! Or rather, I'm reading the newspaper!

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.000
And I'M SURE I'M READING THE NEWSPAPER!

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.400
Egg headed!

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.800
Ouch!

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.500
– Denture Chicken, my old friend!

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.550
– Tobias! I'm glad to see you!

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.500
– Come here! Let's talk!

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.080
– All right?
– All fine!

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:23.200
Ow... Little bald... Did you know that we are sitting below a jackfruit tree?

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.820
– I don't care whether it is a tree of jackfruit, star fruit or orange!

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.360
Now no one else will talk while I'm reading the newspaper!

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.000
– But sir...
– Shut up!

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.959
– ...You need...
– Be QUIET!

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.000
–...to be careful!

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.500
Get out of here now!

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.680
You BOTH!

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:55.200
Ow...

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:59.499
Sir, when your mother was pregnant, she had desire to eat jackfruit...

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.700
...and could not eat?

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.800
– Enough! Not another word!

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:09.449
– But you have jackfruit face...
