00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.460
 video I will teach you how to import 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.500
 contacts of your sim card in the case of 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.420
 suddenly they have the phone 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.929
 completely not of man and they finish it 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.160
 to go finish entering a sim card 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.500
 than bringing another phone and they want 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.350
 store it in a way or as a backup 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.869
 or save your contacts and your phone 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.180
 The procedure is very simple 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:30.449

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.430

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.920

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.990

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:16.900
 to the phone contacts using the 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.620
 fifth with the needle to import 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:23.260
 do not care from the sim card 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:26.320
 is this third option from the base above 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.930
 in port of the card without saving 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.640
 the phone telling you that there will be of 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.190
 all of you can select which 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.410

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.490
 change tenth on the other thus conserve 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.100
 the contacts in the phone and save 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.450
