the beginning chain and pull it tight
this<00:02:09.509> time<00:02:09.869> because<00:02:10.259> we<00:02:10.440> don't<00:02:10.709> want<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:10.979> work

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
this time because we don't want to work

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.540 
this time because we don't want to work
into<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.180> slip<00:02:12.480> stitch<00:02:12.720> if<00:02:13.650> we<00:02:13.920> do<00:02:14.069> it<00:02:14.280> every

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
into the slip stitch if we do it every

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.660 
into the slip stitch if we do it every
every<00:02:15.440> round<00:02:16.440> it's<00:02:16.830> gonna<00:02:17.099> travel<00:02:17.310> to<00:02:17.550> the

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
every round it's gonna travel to the

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.580 
every round it's gonna travel to the
left<00:02:17.910> instead<00:02:18.270> of<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.569> right<00:02:18.750> so<00:02:21.319> if<00:02:22.319> we<00:02:22.470> do

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
left instead of the right so if we do

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.699 
left instead of the right so if we do
the<00:02:22.709> loose<00:02:22.890> slip<00:02:23.129> stitch<00:02:23.370> that<00:02:23.580> is<00:02:24.410> so<00:02:25.410> now<00:02:25.590> I'm
