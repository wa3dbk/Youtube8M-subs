to<00:00:59.070> its<00:00:59.250> original<00:00:59.460> settings<00:01:00.410> sometimes<00:01:01.410> when

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
to its original settings sometimes when

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.529 
to its original settings sometimes when
I'm<00:01:01.920> working<00:01:02.070> with<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.370> person<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:02.940> their

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
I'm working with a person and their

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.660 
I'm working with a person and their
digital<00:01:03.930> camera<00:01:04.320> seems<00:01:04.559> all<00:01:04.769> messed<00:01:05.220> up<00:01:05.430> I

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
digital camera seems all messed up I

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.760 
digital camera seems all messed up I
could<00:01:06.450> try<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.720> go<00:01:06.960> into<00:01:07.110> all<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.590> different

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
could try to go into all the different

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.399 
could try to go into all the different
individual<00:01:08.549> settings<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.180> try<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.810> find<00:01:10.170> what

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
individual settings and try to find what

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.710 
individual settings and try to find what
they<00:01:10.530> messed<00:01:10.770> up<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.130> reset<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.180> setting<00:01:12.540> to

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
they messed up and reset the setting to

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.320 
they messed up and reset the setting to
a<00:01:12.750> good<00:01:13.140> setting<00:01:13.590> but<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.250> find<00:01:14.580> it's<00:01:14.760> easier<00:01:14.970> to

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
a good setting but I find it's easier to

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.390 
a good setting but I find it's easier to
simply<00:01:15.659> go<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.840> reset<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.590> default<00:01:17.009> settings

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
simply go to reset to default settings

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.120 
simply go to reset to default settings
in<00:01:17.580> their<00:01:18.090> cameras<00:01:18.479> menu<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.020> reset<00:01:19.860> all<00:01:20.070> the

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
in their cameras menu and reset all the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.520 
in their cameras menu and reset all the
settings<00:01:20.670> back<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.600> original<00:01:22.140> settings

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
settings back to the original settings

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.560 
settings back to the original settings
and<00:01:22.740> their<00:01:23.250> camera<00:01:23.640> generally<00:01:24.090> works<00:01:24.299> good

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
and their camera generally works good

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.990 
and their camera generally works good
again<00:01:24.869> so<00:01:25.159> even<00:01:26.159> if<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.369> don't<00:01:26.549> know<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.759> lot

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
again so even if you don't know a lot

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.700 
again so even if you don't know a lot
about<00:01:27.060> your<00:01:27.390> digital<00:01:27.810> camera<00:01:28.200> settings<00:01:28.530> if

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
about your digital camera settings if

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.370 
about your digital camera settings if
your<00:01:29.220> camera<00:01:29.640> settings<00:01:29.850> get<00:01:30.210> messed<00:01:30.540> up<00:01:30.750> you

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
your camera settings get messed up you

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.170 
your camera settings get messed up you
can<00:01:31.530> reset<00:01:31.979> them<00:01:32.100> back<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.579> original

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
can reset them back to the original

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.600 
can reset them back to the original
settings<00:01:33.630> with<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.020> reset<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.740> default<00:01:35.159> setting

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
settings with a reset to default setting

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.670 
settings with a reset to default setting
so<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:36.509> gives<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.990> freedom<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.380> be<00:01:37.619> able

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
so this gives you the freedom to be able

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.830 
so this gives you the freedom to be able
to<00:01:37.860> explore<00:01:38.250> your<00:01:38.460> digital<00:01:38.850> camera<00:01:39.270> try

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
different settings and if somehow they

get<00:01:41.970> messed<00:01:42.210> up<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.810> can<00:01:43.020> simply<00:01:43.170> reset<00:01:43.829> them

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
get messed up you can simply reset them

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.830 
get messed up you can simply reset them
