00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
getting it Astro the reason why is

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.399

batteries and I mean in a year you'll be
going<00:01:57.180> through<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:57.630> much<00:01:57.750> batteries<00:01:58.229> you're

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
going through so much batteries you're

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.480 
going through so much batteries you're
gonna<00:01:58.649> be<00:01:58.979> hard<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.159> count

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
gonna be hard to count

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.969 
gonna be hard to count
personally<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:00.420> have<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.659> Triton<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.140> X<00:02:01.350> Pro<00:02:01.710> I

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
personally I have a Triton a X Pro I

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.289 
personally I have a Triton a X Pro I
really<00:02:02.670> love<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:03.000> has<00:02:03.270> seven<00:02:03.570> speakers<00:02:03.979> and<00:02:05.299> I

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
think the troika

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.300 
think the troika
the<00:02:08.489> Triton<00:02:08.879> a<00:02:09.090> X<00:02:09.450> Pro<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.679> the

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
the Triton a X Pro and the

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.020 
the Triton a X Pro and the
Astro<00:02:11.930> ax<00:02:12.930> 40<00:02:13.319> or<00:02:13.500> yeah<00:02:13.830> ax<00:02:14.190> 40<00:02:14.520> have<00:02:14.730> both

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
Astro ax 40 or yeah ax 40 have both

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.199 
Astro ax 40 or yeah ax 40 have both
seven<00:02:15.420> speakers<00:02:16.100> and<00:02:17.100> Y<00:02:17.610> headset<00:02:18.000> is<00:02:18.120> so

seven speakers and Y headset is so

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.080 
seven speakers and Y headset is so
important<00:02:18.630> is<00:02:18.720> because<00:02:18.990> you<00:02:19.170> can<00:02:19.500> hear<00:02:20.090> in

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
important is because you can hear in

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.370 
important is because you can hear in
different<00:02:21.480> directions<00:02:21.780> you<00:02:22.140> can<00:02:22.230> hear

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
different directions you can hear

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.309 
different directions you can hear
footsteps<00:02:22.700> gunfire<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:24.330> your<00:02:24.750> alertness<00:02:24.990> is

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
footsteps gunfire and your alertness is

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:26.300 
footsteps gunfire and your alertness is
just<00:02:25.500> so<00:02:25.770> much<00:02:25.860> better

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
just so much better

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.750 
just so much better
so<00:02:26.760> next<00:02:27.060> some<00:02:27.600> in-game<00:02:27.930> things<00:02:28.230> I<00:02:28.830> know<00:02:29.190> this

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
so next some in-game things I know this

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.070 
so next some in-game things I know this
has<00:02:29.940> been<00:02:30.090> mentioned<00:02:30.209> before<00:02:30.420> but<00:02:30.840> turn<00:02:30.989> up

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
has been mentioned before but turn up

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.510 
has been mentioned before but turn up
your<00:02:31.170> brightness<00:02:31.530> on<00:02:31.709> every<00:02:31.980> call<00:02:32.160> of<00:02:32.280> duty<00:02:32.489> I

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
your brightness on every call of duty I

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.990 
your brightness on every call of duty I
have<00:02:32.819> my<00:02:32.940> brightness<00:02:33.180> all<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.989> way<00:02:34.230> up<00:02:34.850> to<00:02:35.850> be

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
have my brightness all the way up to be

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.610 
have my brightness all the way up to be
able<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.239> see<00:02:36.390> in<00:02:36.569> corners<00:02:36.989> corners<00:02:37.290> are<00:02:37.530> not

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
able to see in corners corners are not

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.979 
able to see in corners corners are not
dark<00:02:37.890> and<00:02:38.220> you<00:02:39.150> know<00:02:39.270> once<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:39.569> have<00:02:39.750> it<00:02:39.870> up

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
dark and you know once you have it up

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.180 
dark and you know once you have it up
all<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.230> way<00:02:40.670> it's<00:02:41.670> just<00:02:42.060> really<00:02:42.360> helpful<00:02:43.190> if

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
all the way it's just really helpful if

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.070 
all the way it's just really helpful if
you<00:02:44.310> see<00:02:44.519> someone<00:02:44.730> camp<00:02:44.970> in<00:02:45.090> a<00:02:45.180> corner<00:02:45.540> or

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
you see someone camp in a corner or

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.660 
you see someone camp in a corner or
something<00:02:46.560> like<00:02:46.620> that<00:02:46.680> especially<00:02:47.220> when<00:02:47.580> they

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
something like that especially when they

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.180 
something like that especially when they
have<00:02:47.760> cold<00:02:47.940> blood<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:48.360> they<00:02:48.480> have<00:02:48.600> no<00:02:49.190> name

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
have cold blood and they have no name

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.740 
have cold blood and they have no name
tag<00:02:50.430> that<00:02:50.670> comes<00:02:50.850> up<00:02:51.030> it's<00:02:51.300> gonna<00:02:51.480> be<00:02:51.600> a<00:02:51.660> lot

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
tag that comes up it's gonna be a lot

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.920 
tag that comes up it's gonna be a lot
easier<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.200> see<00:02:52.320> them<00:02:52.880> next<00:02:53.880> using<00:02:54.690> a

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
easier to see them next using a

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.370 
easier to see them next using a
comfortable<00:02:55.560> sensitivity<00:02:56.870> this<00:02:57.870> is<00:02:58.080> probably

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
comfortable sensitivity this is probably

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.080 
comfortable sensitivity this is probably
one<00:02:58.620> of<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.830> next<00:02:59.220> biggest<00:02:59.430> things<00:02:59.790> on<00:03:00.000> the

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
one of the next biggest things on the

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.949 
one of the next biggest things on the
list<00:03:00.800> definitely<00:03:01.800> definitely<00:03:02.430> do<00:03:02.880> not<00:03:03.090> use<00:03:03.660> a

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
list definitely definitely do not use a

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.809 
list definitely definitely do not use a
sensitivity<00:03:04.680> that<00:03:04.860> you're<00:03:05.400> trying<00:03:05.610> to<00:03:05.670> show

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
sensitivity that you're trying to show

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.640 
sensitivity that you're trying to show
off<00:03:05.850> with<00:03:06.239> or<00:03:06.450> you<00:03:06.660> know<00:03:06.690> I<00:03:07.080> want<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:07.290> say<00:03:07.440> show

off with or you know I want to say show

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.390 
off with or you know I want to say show
off<00:03:07.860> but<00:03:08.220> trying<00:03:09.120> to<00:03:09.440> you<00:03:10.440> know<00:03:10.500> just<00:03:11.040> trying

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.400 
play on eight when I'm typing I play on
ten<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:18.060> reason<00:03:18.299> why<00:03:18.420> is<00:03:18.480> because<00:03:18.750> with<00:03:19.230> eight

you can control for me I can control my

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.170 
you can control for me I can control my
guns<00:03:22.019> a<00:03:22.380> lot<00:03:22.650> better<00:03:22.950> my<00:03:23.280> assault<00:03:23.760> rifle<00:03:24.060> is<00:03:24.120> a

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
guns a lot better my assault rifle is a

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.440 
guns a lot better my assault rifle is a
lot<00:03:24.299> better<00:03:24.510> at<00:03:25.079> smoother<00:03:25.560> I<00:03:26.220> don't<00:03:27.090> say<00:03:27.329> it's

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
lot better at smoother I don't say it's

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.250 
lot better at smoother I don't say it's
smoother<00:03:28.549> motion<00:03:29.549> with<00:03:29.940> my<00:03:29.970> gun<00:03:30.299> but

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
smoother motion with my gun but

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.750 
smoother motion with my gun but
personally<00:03:31.680> there's<00:03:31.950> people<00:03:32.220> a<00:03:32.459> lot<00:03:32.730> of

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
personally there's people a lot of

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.880 
personally there's people a lot of
people<00:03:32.910> who<00:03:33.120> play<00:03:33.269> with<00:03:33.480> you<00:03:33.630> know<00:03:33.750> four<00:03:34.110> five

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
that's the main thing after stress

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
yeah next we have using comfortable

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.340 
yeah next we have using comfortable
killstreaks<00:03:47.239> this<00:03:48.239> is<00:03:48.390> something<00:03:48.630> that<00:03:48.780> some

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
killstreaks this is something that some

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.810 
killstreaks this is something that some
people<00:03:49.380> don't<00:03:49.680> mention<00:03:49.890> too<00:03:50.160> much<00:03:50.340> and<00:03:50.609> the

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
people don't mention too much and the

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.300 
people don't mention too much and the
reason<00:03:51.269> why<00:03:51.870> this<00:03:51.930> is<00:03:52.350> really<00:03:52.829> really

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
reason why this is really really

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.039

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
going in the middle of a map it just

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.960 
going in the middle of a map it just
leads<00:04:38.530> to<00:04:38.770> that<00:04:38.890> for<00:04:39.130> example<00:04:39.520> and<00:04:39.670> run<00:04:39.820> down

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970

the<00:04:45.370> middle<00:04:45.700> of<00:04:45.790> the<00:04:45.850> map<00:04:46.230> to<00:04:47.230> go<00:04:47.410> around<00:04:47.800> the

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:48.730 
the middle of the map to go around the

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.320 
the middle of the map to go around the
outskirts<00:04:49.270> like<00:04:49.660> for<00:04:49.840> example<00:04:50.020> waistline<00:04:51.330> in
