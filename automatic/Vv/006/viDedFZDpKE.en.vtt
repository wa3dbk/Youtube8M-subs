00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
ops for the PC I had a problem which

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.680 
ops for the PC I had a problem which
meant<00:00:11.040> that<00:00:11.160> I'd<00:00:11.670> would<00:00:11.969> be<00:00:12.120> play<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.509> game

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
meant that I'd would be play the game

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.259 
meant that I'd would be play the game
animals<00:00:13.410> claire<00:00:13.650> match<00:00:13.860> and<00:00:14.160> i<00:00:15.059> would

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
animals claire match and i would

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.510 
animals claire match and i would
randomly<00:00:15.809> just<00:00:16.289> seem<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:16.650> get<00:00:16.830> kicked<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.220> off

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
randomly just seem to get kicked to off

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.269 
randomly just seem to get kicked to off
the<00:00:17.789> server<00:00:18.380> at<00:00:19.380> first<00:00:19.619> I<00:00:19.710> thought<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.039> server

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
the server at first I thought the server

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.740 
the server at first I thought the server
must<00:00:20.520> have<00:00:20.609> shut<00:00:20.789> down<00:00:20.970> all<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.240> horse<00:00:21.449> must

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
must have shut down all the horse must

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.230 
must have shut down all the horse must
have<00:00:21.930> left<00:00:22.560> up<00:00:22.920> something<00:00:23.519> but<00:00:23.699> then<00:00:23.880> when<00:00:24.210> I

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
have left up something but then when I

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.019 
have left up something but then when I
started<00:00:24.630> favorite<00:00:25.080> in<00:00:25.170> servers<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:26.029> realized

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
started favorite in servers I realized

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.460 
started favorite in servers I realized
that<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.300> was<00:00:27.539> getting<00:00:27.660> kicked<00:00:27.930> off<00:00:28.170> but<00:00:28.349> the

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
that I was getting kicked off but the

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.779 
that I was getting kicked off but the
server<00:00:28.680> was<00:00:28.830> still<00:00:29.070> there<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.279> was<00:00:29.519> able<00:00:29.760> to

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
server was still there I was able to

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.550 
server was still there I was able to
join<00:00:30.060> but<00:00:30.330> obviously<00:00:30.689> my<00:00:31.080> points<00:00:31.439> would<00:00:31.529> have

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
join but obviously my points would have

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.500 
join but obviously my points would have
been<00:00:31.650> reset<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.700> it<00:00:32.730> was<00:00:32.940> getting<00:00:33.210> really

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
been reset and it was getting really

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.340 
been reset and it was getting really
annoying<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:34.200> almost<00:00:34.590> thought<00:00:34.920> about<00:00:34.980> him

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
annoying I almost thought about him

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.420 
annoying I almost thought about him
getting<00:00:37.350> another<00:00:37.710> game<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.070> stopping

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
getting another game and stopping

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.709 
getting another game and stopping
playing<00:00:38.579> backups<00:00:39.030> which<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.300> shame<00:00:39.660> because

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
playing backups which is a shame because

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.619 
playing backups which is a shame because
such<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.110> good<00:00:40.320> game<00:00:40.500> but<00:00:41.030> here's<00:00:42.030> our<00:00:42.149> fixed<00:00:42.510> it

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
such a good game but here's our fixed it

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.430 
such a good game but here's our fixed it
this<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:44.629> fix<00:00:45.629> which<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.289> do<00:00:46.350> with

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
this is a fix which is to do with

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.400 
this is a fix which is to do with
opening<00:00:46.800> ports<00:00:47.219> on<00:00:47.399> your<00:00:47.460> router<00:00:48.360> so<00:00:49.170> the

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
opening ports on your router so the

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.959 
opening ports on your router so the
route<00:00:49.590> might<00:00:49.890> look<00:00:50.039> different<00:00:50.219> on<00:00:50.730> mine

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
route might look different on mine

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.420 
route might look different on mine
because<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.270> use<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:52.379> lure<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:53.010> someone

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
because I use it to lure you someone

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.979 
because I use it to lure you someone
else<00:00:53.579> Maya<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.329> different<00:00:54.690> internet

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
else Maya the different internet

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.900 
else Maya the different internet
companies<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:55.590> yours<00:00:56.550> might<00:00:56.610> be<00:00:56.760> different

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
companies so yours might be different

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.779 
companies so yours might be different
but<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.690> general<00:00:57.989> idea<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.440> same<00:00:58.789> what

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
but the general idea is the same what

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.549 
but the general idea is the same what
you<00:00:59.850> want<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.030> do<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.239> go<00:01:00.420> into<00:01:00.570> your<00:01:00.719> ruler

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
you want to do is go into your ruler

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.410 
you want to do is go into your ruler
settings<00:01:01.980> which<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.399> usually<00:01:02.730> like<00:01:02.940> some<00:01:03.239> kind

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
settings which is usually like some kind

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.280 
settings which is usually like some kind
of<00:01:03.449> internet<00:01:03.840> site<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.680> configure<00:01:05.460> router<00:01:05.610> and

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
of internet site to configure router and

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.399 
of internet site to configure router and
the<00:01:07.290> way<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.650> did<00:01:08.010> this<00:01:08.220> was<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:09.600> would<00:01:10.229> go

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
the way that I did this was I would go

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.070 
the way that I did this was I would go
something<00:01:10.770> like<00:01:11.360> you'd<00:01:12.360> essentially<00:01:12.720> open

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
something like you'd essentially open

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.039 
something like you'd essentially open
fire<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.830> firewall<00:01:14.310> or<00:01:14.630> create<00:01:15.630> some<00:01:15.810> kind<00:01:15.930> of

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
fire the firewall or create some kind of

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.609 
fire the firewall or create some kind of
application<00:01:16.229> sharing<00:01:17.360> bit<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:19.170> what<00:01:19.439> I<00:01:19.470> did

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
application sharing bit so what I did

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.570 
application sharing bit so what I did
was<00:01:21.140> the<00:01:22.140> black<00:01:22.380> ops<00:01:22.590> wasn't<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:23.100> there<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:23.369> I

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
was the black ops wasn't in there so I

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.950 
was the black ops wasn't in there so I
created<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.450> new<00:01:24.500> name<00:01:25.500> for<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:26.750> that<00:01:27.750> was<00:01:27.840> gonna

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
created a new name for it that was gonna

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:35.569 
created a new name for it that was gonna
make<00:01:29.119> call<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.380> black<00:01:31.380> ops<00:01:33.799> this<00:01:34.799> or<00:01:35.159> else<00:01:35.460> I've

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579

so this is how you would you would make

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.320 
so this is how you would you would make
a<00:02:03.040> new<00:02:03.220> one<00:02:03.460> but<00:02:03.610> you<00:02:03.700> would<00:02:03.850> just<00:02:04.000> do<00:02:04.150> this

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
a new one but you would just do this

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.860 
a new one but you would just do this
stuff<00:02:04.570> inside<00:02:04.900> it<00:02:05.110> so<00:02:06.070> when<00:02:06.220> you've<00:02:06.340> made<00:02:06.490> one

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
stuff inside it so when you've made one

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.090 
stuff inside it so when you've made one
it's<00:02:07.870> going<00:02:08.020> to<00:02:08.110> give<00:02:08.200> you<00:02:08.259> some<00:02:08.410> options<00:02:08.560> of

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
it's going to give you some options of

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.400 
it's going to give you some options of
which<00:02:09.280> parts<00:02:09.700> you<00:02:09.790> would<00:02:09.880> like<00:02:10.060> to<00:02:10.210> open<00:02:12.180> and

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
which parts you would like to open and

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.970 
which parts you would like to open and
it's<00:02:14.410> all<00:02:14.680> to<00:02:14.950> do<00:02:15.070> with<00:02:15.100> this<00:02:15.400> TCP<00:02:15.970> and<00:02:16.450> UDP

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
it's all to do with this TCP and UDP

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.350 
it's all to do with this TCP and UDP
ports<00:02:17.980> I<00:02:18.190> don't<00:02:18.520> know<00:02:18.580> the<00:02:18.670> difference<00:02:19.030> I'm<00:02:19.270> a

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
ports I don't know the difference I'm a

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.910 
ports I don't know the difference I'm a
bit<00:02:19.510> of<00:02:19.600> a<00:02:19.720> new<00:02:20.080> but<00:02:20.320> it<00:02:20.410> comes<00:02:20.530> to<00:02:20.680> know<00:02:20.770> about

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
bit of a new but it comes to know about

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.950 
bit of a new but it comes to know about
this<00:02:21.130> kind<00:02:21.280> of<00:02:21.400> stuff<00:02:21.580> but<00:02:21.790> this<00:02:21.910> is<00:02:22.030> just<00:02:22.150> what

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
this kind of stuff but this is just what

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.540 
this kind of stuff but this is just what
I<00:02:22.990> found<00:02:23.260> that<00:02:23.380> worked<00:02:23.620> so<00:02:24.000> you<00:02:25.000> want<00:02:25.270> to<00:02:25.510> open

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
I found that worked so you want to open

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:33.300 
I found that worked so you want to open
on<00:02:27.550> both<00:02:28.270> TCP<00:02:28.840> and<00:02:29.500> UDP<00:02:31.920> you<00:02:32.920> want<00:02:33.100> to<00:02:33.160> open

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
on both TCP and UDP you want to open

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.120 
on both TCP and UDP you want to open
three<00:02:33.820> zero<00:02:34.090> seven<00:02:34.630> four<00:02:34.930> on<00:02:35.280> both<00:02:36.280> and<00:02:38.130> that's

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
three zero seven four on both and that's

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.350 
three zero seven four on both and that's
for<00:02:39.459> the<00:02:39.610> Blackhawks<00:02:39.820> game<00:02:40.180> itself<00:02:40.570> I<00:02:40.870> also

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
for the Blackhawks game itself I also

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.140 
for the Blackhawks game itself I also
like<00:02:43.360> this<00:02:43.480> quickly<00:02:43.840> go<00:02:44.020> back<00:02:44.290> I<00:02:44.890> also<00:02:45.730> made

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
like this quickly go back I also made

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.510 
like this quickly go back I also made
another<00:02:46.180> one<00:02:46.570> which<00:02:47.170> was<00:02:47.410> for<00:02:47.650> steam<00:02:48.040> itself

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
another one which was for steam itself

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.420 
another one which was for steam itself
and<00:02:49.650> which<00:02:50.650> was<00:02:50.830> a<00:02:50.860> look<00:02:51.100> took<00:02:51.250> a<00:02:51.310> little

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
and which was a look took a little

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.520 
and which was a look took a little
margarine<00:02:51.940> but<00:02:52.150> I<00:02:52.540> did<00:02:53.110> them<00:02:53.200> both<00:02:53.350> at<00:02:53.470> the

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
margarine but I did them both at the

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:54.990 
margarine but I did them both at the
same<00:02:53.709> time<00:02:53.920> I<00:02:53.950> don't<00:02:54.130> know<00:02:54.250> which<00:02:54.459> one<00:02:54.640> was<00:02:54.850> the

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
same time I don't know which one was the

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.970 
same time I don't know which one was the
problem<00:02:55.390> but<00:02:55.570> yeah<00:02:56.200> I<00:02:56.230> made<00:02:56.470> one<00:02:56.500> with<00:02:56.709> steam

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
problem but yeah I made one with steam

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.080 
problem but yeah I made one with steam
as<00:02:57.160> well<00:02:57.310> which<00:02:57.640> was<00:02:57.880> UDP<00:02:59.670> two<00:03:00.670> seven<00:03:01.060> zero

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
as well which was UDP two seven zero

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
as well which was UDP two seven zero
zero<00:03:01.450> zero<00:03:01.840> two<00:03:02.800> two<00:03:03.070> seven<00:03:03.489> zero<00:03:03.910> one<00:03:04.810> five

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
zero zero two two seven zero one five

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:11.190 
zero zero two two seven zero one five
and<00:03:07.140> then<00:03:08.140> again<00:03:08.440> UDP<00:03:09.160> two<00:03:09.580> seven<00:03:10.090> zero<00:03:10.200> one

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
and then again UDP two seven zero one

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.430 
and then again UDP two seven zero one
five<00:03:11.830> two<00:03:12.310> two<00:03:12.430> seven<00:03:12.880> zero<00:03:12.910> three<00:03:13.840> zero<00:03:13.870> and

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
five two two seven zero three zero and

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.440 
five two two seven zero three zero and
then<00:03:15.060> almost<00:03:16.060> the<00:03:16.390> same<00:03:16.540> again<00:03:16.900> but<00:03:17.320> for<00:03:17.620> TCP

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
then almost the same again but for TCP

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.530 
then almost the same again but for TCP
two<00:03:19.450> seven<00:03:19.900> zero<00:03:19.930> one<00:03:20.680> four<00:03:21.160> two<00:03:21.820> two<00:03:22.030> seven

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
two seven zero one four two two seven

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.180 
two seven zero one four two two seven
zero<00:03:22.750> five<00:03:23.650> zero<00:03:24.100> and<00:03:25.560> this<00:03:26.560> seems<00:03:26.920> to<00:03:27.100> have

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
zero five zero and this seems to have

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.340 
zero five zero and this seems to have
completely<00:03:27.370> fixed<00:03:28.000> the<00:03:28.090> problem<00:03:28.480> I<00:03:28.630> don't<00:03:29.170> get

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
completely fixed the problem I don't get

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.800 
completely fixed the problem I don't get
kicked<00:03:29.530> off<00:03:29.680> anymore<00:03:30.070> I<00:03:30.910> think<00:03:31.060> so<00:03:31.420> this<00:03:31.630> means

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
kicked off anymore I think so this means

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.390 
kicked off anymore I think so this means
it's<00:03:32.019> probably<00:03:32.230> a<00:03:32.440> firewall<00:03:32.860> related<00:03:33.250> issue

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
it's probably a firewall related issue

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.750 
it's probably a firewall related issue
which<00:03:34.239> was<00:03:34.420> stopping<00:03:34.840> me<00:03:34.959> from<00:03:35.610> keeping<00:03:36.610> in<00:03:36.700> a

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
which was stopping me from keeping in a

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.640 
which was stopping me from keeping in a
game<00:03:36.940> for<00:03:36.970> extended<00:03:37.480> period<00:03:37.720> of<00:03:37.780> time

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
game for extended period of time

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.280 
game for extended period of time
I<00:03:38.680> hope<00:03:39.190> this<00:03:39.310> helps<00:03:39.610> you<00:03:39.700> guys<00:03:40.030> because<00:03:40.510> this

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290
