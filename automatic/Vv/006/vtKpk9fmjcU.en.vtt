 rotation during needle insertion 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:13.180
 reduces the degree of needle deflection that 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.520
 improves efficiency and predictability

 needle paths 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.780
 can activate the mode sculpts flow 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.690
 in normal mode there are two

 lightly press the foot pedal 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.729
 full pedal activation activates the mode

 Cruise control 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.200
 To do this, press the foot pedal and 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.720
 hold it for three sound 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.060
 signals when you hear a sound

 and method be lateral rotation in 

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:06.119
 the process of maintaining the needle reduces the degree 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.220
 deviations 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.800
 needles improves accuracy by holding andy 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.840
 polar anesthesia and slowly advance 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.380
 the needle until it touches the bone

 jaws 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:24.030
 finding the optimal place to feed the solution 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.370
 anesthetic test aspirate 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.440
 pressing and releasing the foot pedal 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.080
 case negative aspiration 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.910
 try you can continue the injection when 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.950
 positive aspiration is necessary 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.930
 change the position of the needle after which 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.940
 rerun test 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.920
 pressing and releasing the foot pedal 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.110
 case negative repeat 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.090
 aspiration tests 1 quarter cartridge 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.510
 no static is introduced at speed control 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.370
 flow 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.040
 then you can activate the mode 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.629
 repitsu this feature you must 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.790
 use only after full 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:56.099
 soft tissue pain relief on that 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.690
 will indicate your patient when you entered 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:59.069
 required volume of anesthetic solution 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.650
 can be extracted 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.030
 the game 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.189
 to prevent reverse movement 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.209
 anesthetic solution and getting it into 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:06.730
 oral cavity 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.530
 perform the following manipulations for now 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.629
 the needle is in the tissues click and 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.640
 release the foot pedal after three 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:15.010
 beeps can extract one of 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.870
 Oral patient remove the game 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.849
 away from the patient as from her 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.140
 anesthetic may be released when 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.540
 the need for additional 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.200
 pain relief can change the cartridge and 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.200
 continue
