00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
internal it's not external so anytime

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.410 
internal it's not external so anytime
you're<00:00:20.369> going<00:00:20.609> through<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.760> trial<00:00:21.029> that's<00:00:21.270> an

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
you're going through a trial that's an

because you know that at the end result
God<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.119> going<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.300> produce<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.840> mold<00:00:31.050> and
