the<00:00:24.900> goal<00:00:25.110> for<00:00:25.349> them<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.829> to<00:00:26.369> essentially

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
the goal for them is to essentially

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.839 
the goal for them is to essentially
build<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.710> shoe<00:00:28.920> that<00:00:29.189> works<00:00:29.429> with<00:00:29.699> the

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
build the shoe that works with the

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.999 
build the shoe that works with the
person's<00:00:30.240> stride<00:00:30.539> doesn't<00:00:31.470> try<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.650> fight<00:00:31.980> it

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
person's stride doesn't try to fight it

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.880 
person's stride doesn't try to fight it
like<00:00:32.369> we've<00:00:32.669> seen<00:00:33.019> you<00:00:34.019> know<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.410> last<00:00:34.589> 10<00:00:34.800> or

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
like we've seen you know the last 10 or

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.890 
like we've seen you know the last 10 or
20<00:00:35.100> years<00:00:35.129> with<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.580> real<00:00:35.850> stiff<00:00:36.150> dual-density

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:36.900 
20 years with a real stiff dual-density

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.500 
20 years with a real stiff dual-density
stuff<00:00:37.710> like<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:38.100> this<00:00:38.610> gets<00:00:38.820> away<00:00:39.059> from<00:00:39.089> some

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
stuff like that this gets away from some

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.360 
stuff like that this gets away from some
of<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:39.720> what<00:00:40.290> are<00:00:40.379> they<00:00:40.470> doing<00:00:40.800> first<00:00:41.160> thing

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
of that what are they doing first thing

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.250 
of that what are they doing first thing
here<00:00:41.579> you'll<00:00:41.760> see<00:00:41.909> guide<00:00:42.150> rails<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.960> what<00:00:43.140> the

here you'll see guide rails and what the

shoe<00:00:45.479> is<00:00:45.720> essentially<00:00:46.470> set<00:00:46.710> up<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:47.309> that<00:00:47.519> a

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:47.729 
shoe is essentially set up so that a

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:49.939 
shoe is essentially set up so that a
little<00:00:48.030> bit<00:00:48.299> of<00:00:48.479> a<00:00:48.600> whiter<00:00:49.049> platform<00:00:49.710> here

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:49.949 
little bit of a whiter platform here

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:52.399 
little bit of a whiter platform here
from<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.760> mid<00:00:51.030> foot<00:00:51.269> forward<00:00:51.690> what<00:00:52.199> these

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:52.409 
from the mid foot forward what these

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:53.840 
from the mid foot forward what these
rails<00:00:52.710> are<00:00:52.890> doing<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.159> let<00:00:53.339> your<00:00:53.489> foot<00:00:53.670> really

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
rails are doing is let your foot really

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.390 
rails are doing is let your foot really
sit<00:00:54.180> down<00:00:54.360> in<00:00:54.600> there<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.080> it<00:00:55.860> kind<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.159> guides

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:56.400 
sit down in there and it kind of guides

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.429 
sit down in there and it kind of guides
you<00:00:56.580> through<00:00:56.989> your<00:00:59.089> gait<00:01:00.089> a<00:01:00.330> little<00:01:00.659> more<00:01:00.839> you

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:01.439 
you through your gait a little more you

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:05.119 
you through your gait a little more you
know<00:01:01.470> narrowed<00:01:02.250> hill<00:01:02.519> here<00:01:03.589> nice<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.949> and

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
know narrowed hill here nice and and

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.640 
know narrowed hill here nice and and
smooth<00:01:05.880> tailored<00:01:06.810> around<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.229> hill<00:01:07.409> so

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
smooth tailored around the hill so

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.440 
smooth tailored around the hill so
you're<00:01:07.799> not<00:01:07.950> looking<00:01:08.250> at<00:01:08.369> big<00:01:08.580> lever<00:01:09.060> arms

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
you're not looking at big lever arms

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.300 
you're not looking at big lever arms
there<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:10.259> what<00:01:10.409> they<00:01:10.590> found<00:01:10.799> out<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.280> that

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
there and what they found out is that

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.360 
there and what they found out is that
the<00:01:12.299> place<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:13.170> your<00:01:13.320> foot<00:01:13.590> takes<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.190> most

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
the place that your foot takes the most

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.550 
the place that your foot takes the most
punishment<00:01:15.240> or<00:01:15.630> does<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.960> most<00:01:16.170> work<00:01:16.350> is

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
punishment or does the most work is

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.920 
punishment or does the most work is
actually<00:01:16.740> mid<00:01:17.130> foot<00:01:17.310> forward<00:01:17.760> and<00:01:17.910> so<00:01:18.450> what

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
actually mid foot forward and so what

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.570 
actually mid foot forward and so what
they've<00:01:19.110> done<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:19.350> they've<00:01:19.650> dropped<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.370> hill

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
they've done is they've dropped the hill

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.160 
they've done is they've dropped the hill
a<00:01:20.610> little<00:01:20.760> bit<00:01:20.940> it's<00:01:21.180> an<00:01:21.300> 8<00:01:21.450> millimeter<00:01:21.930> drop

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
a little bit it's an 8 millimeter drop

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.680 
a little bit it's an 8 millimeter drop
shoe<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:23.010> it's<00:01:23.160> nice<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.370> the<00:01:24.030> profile<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.630> a

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
shoe so it's nice and the profile is a

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.240 
shoe so it's nice and the profile is a
little<00:01:24.960> lower<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.409> ground<00:01:25.440> a<00:01:25.800> little<00:01:26.070> more

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
little lower to the ground a little more

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.490 
little lower to the ground a little more
stable<00:01:27.000> just<00:01:27.480> inherently<00:01:27.960> because<00:01:28.320> it's

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
stable just inherently because it's

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.380 
stable just inherently because it's
lower<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.830> the<00:01:28.920> ground<00:01:28.950> because<00:01:29.790> they<00:01:30.150> drop

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
lower to the ground because they drop

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.720 
lower to the ground because they drop
that<00:01:30.600> they<00:01:30.900> make<00:01:31.110> everything<00:01:31.730> caterpillar

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:32.730 
that they make everything caterpillar

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.220 
that they make everything caterpillar
here<00:01:33.060> like<00:01:33.240> they've<00:01:33.420> been<00:01:33.450> doing<00:01:33.720> in<00:01:33.960> some<00:01:34.140> of

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:34.230 
here like they've been doing in some of

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.450 
here like they've been doing in some of
their<00:01:34.350> other<00:01:34.470> stuff<00:01:34.800> and<00:01:35.040> when<00:01:35.159> they're<00:01:35.310> doing

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
their other stuff and when they're doing

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.280 
their other stuff and when they're doing
that<00:01:35.730> they're<00:01:36.330> allowing<00:01:36.690> a<00:01:36.750> nice<00:01:36.960> smooth

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
that they're allowing a nice smooth

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.500 
that they're allowing a nice smooth
transition<00:01:37.470> quickly<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.760> the<00:01:38.880> forefoot<00:01:39.300> of

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
transition quickly to the forefoot of

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.620 
transition quickly to the forefoot of
the<00:01:40.290> shoe<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.800> forward<00:01:41.190> and<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:42.090> can<00:01:42.240> see<00:01:42.450> how

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
the shoe and forward and you can see how

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.990 
the shoe and forward and you can see how
this<00:01:42.810> base<00:01:43.080> gets<00:01:43.350> wider<00:01:43.620> you<00:01:44.220> also<00:01:44.610> see<00:01:44.820> if<00:01:44.970> you

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
this base gets wider you also see if you

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.300 
this base gets wider you also see if you
look<00:01:45.120> at<00:01:45.420> this<00:01:45.600> here<00:01:45.870> how<00:01:46.530> this<00:01:46.770> comes<00:01:47.040> out<00:01:47.250> a

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
look at this here how this comes out a

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.280 
look at this here how this comes out a
little<00:01:47.520> bit<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.270> adding<00:01:48.630> again<00:01:48.960> some

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
little bit that is adding again some

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.530 
little bit that is adding again some
more<00:01:49.470> stability<00:01:49.800> this<00:01:50.100> year<00:01:50.340> so<00:01:51.180> this<00:01:51.300> shoe

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
more stability this year so this shoe

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.810 
more stability this year so this shoe
essentially<00:01:52.050> is<00:01:52.260> going<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.860> be<00:01:52.979> shoe<00:01:53.190> that<00:01:53.490> is

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
essentially is going to be shoe that is

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.360 
essentially is going to be shoe that is
very<00:01:54.630> stable<00:01:54.930> without<00:01:55.560> sticking<00:01:56.250> that

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
very stable without sticking that

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.980 
very stable without sticking that
dual-density<00:01:56.820> in<00:01:57.180> here<00:01:57.360> so<00:01:57.659> what<00:01:57.840> they're

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
dual-density in here so what they're

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.510 
dual-density in here so what they're
doing<00:01:58.350> is<00:01:58.530> allowing<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.460> with<00:02:00.080> super<00:02:01.080> DNA<00:02:01.520> to

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
doing is allowing you with super DNA to

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.760 
doing is allowing you with super DNA to
get<00:02:03.060> one<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.750> smoothest<00:02:04.200> shoes<00:02:04.440> you've

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
get one of the smoothest shoes you've

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.430 
get one of the smoothest shoes you've
ever<00:02:04.920> seen<00:02:05.250> from<00:02:05.520> Brooks

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
ever seen from Brooks

instability<00:02:07.440> okay<00:02:07.979> this<00:02:08.849> is<00:02:09.209> interesting<00:02:09.420> to

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
instability okay this is interesting to

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.390 
instability okay this is interesting to
me<00:02:09.989> because<00:02:10.140> what<00:02:10.440> I'm<00:02:10.560> wondering<00:02:10.769> is<00:02:11.039> so

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
me because what I'm wondering is so

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.550 
me because what I'm wondering is so
someone<00:02:11.760> that<00:02:11.909> doesn't<00:02:12.090> overpronate<00:02:12.810> because

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
someone that doesn't overpronate because

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.080 
someone that doesn't overpronate because
there's<00:02:13.739> not<00:02:13.920> dual<00:02:14.159> density<00:02:14.400> because<00:02:14.940> there's

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
there's not dual density because there's

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.300 
there's not dual density because there's
a<00:02:15.180> ton<00:02:15.390> of<00:02:15.420> cushion<00:02:15.870> if<00:02:16.319> someone<00:02:16.799> maybe<00:02:16.950> comes

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
a ton of cushion if someone maybe comes

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.739 
a ton of cushion if someone maybe comes
in<00:02:17.489> and<00:02:17.640> they<00:02:17.700> over<00:02:17.909> protonated<00:02:18.329> in<00:02:18.389> one<00:02:18.540> foot

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:18.749 
in and they over protonated in one foot

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:20.360 
in and they over protonated in one foot
a<00:02:18.779> little<00:02:18.930> but<00:02:19.230> not<00:02:19.349> in<00:02:19.529> the<00:02:19.650> other<00:02:19.769> we're

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
a little but not in the other we're

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.490 
a little but not in the other we're
always<00:02:20.549> afraid<00:02:20.879> to<00:02:21.209> over<00:02:21.719> crap<00:02:21.959> that

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
always afraid to over crap that

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.540 
always afraid to over crap that
with<00:02:22.830> crazy<00:02:23.630> stable<00:02:24.630> stability<00:02:25.260> shoe<00:02:25.520> what<00:02:26.520> I

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
with crazy stable stability shoe what I

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.190 
with crazy stable stability shoe what I
wonder<00:02:26.970> is<00:02:27.120> once<00:02:27.420> we<00:02:27.540> get<00:02:27.690> through<00:02:27.930> this<00:02:28.050> and

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
wonder is once we get through this and

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.840 
wonder is once we get through this and
later<00:02:28.380> test<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.710> little<00:02:28.890> bit<00:02:29.040> if<00:02:29.250> we<00:02:29.430> can<00:02:29.610> sell

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
later test a little bit if we can sell

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.240 
later test a little bit if we can sell
this<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.060> someone<00:02:30.390> it<00:02:30.630> needs<00:02:30.780> slight<00:02:31.250> support

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
this to someone it needs slight support

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.790 
this to someone it needs slight support
without<00:02:33.000> over<00:02:33.270> cracking<00:02:34.020> them<00:02:34.140> okay

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
without over cracking them okay

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.400 
without over cracking them okay
retail<00:02:35.460> on<00:02:35.580> this<00:02:35.730> going<00:02:35.970> to<00:02:36.030> be<00:02:36.090> 160<00:02:36.720> but<00:02:37.230> what

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
retail on this going to be 160 but what

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.890 
retail on this going to be 160 but what
you're<00:02:37.560> finding<00:02:37.860> is<00:02:38.220> that<00:02:38.360> they<00:02:39.360> are<00:02:39.570> very

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
you're finding is that they are very

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.920 
you're finding is that they are very
very<00:02:40.080> hopeful<00:02:40.740> with<00:02:40.920> this<00:02:41.070> super<00:02:41.400> DNA<00:02:41.930> that

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
very hopeful with this super DNA that

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.510 
very hopeful with this super DNA that
this<00:02:43.410> shoe<00:02:43.620> is<00:02:43.770> going<00:02:43.890> to<00:02:43.950> last<00:02:44.160> a<00:02:44.400> little

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
this shoe is going to last a little

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.250 
this shoe is going to last a little
longer<00:02:44.670> than<00:02:45.150> what<00:02:45.300> most<00:02:45.450> people<00:02:45.600> are<00:02:45.870> used<00:02:46.170> to

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
longer than what most people are used to

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.280 
longer than what most people are used to
and<00:02:46.820> not<00:02:47.820> only<00:02:48.120> last<00:02:48.300> longer<00:02:48.570> but<00:02:48.750> it<00:02:48.900> just<00:02:49.080> it

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
and not only last longer but it just it

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.500 
and not only last longer but it just it
feels<00:02:49.440> cozier<00:02:49.980> while<00:02:50.220> you're<00:02:50.370> in<00:02:50.490> it<00:02:50.610> so<00:02:51.270> super

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
feels cozier while you're in it so super

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.980 
feels cozier while you're in it so super
DNA<00:02:51.990> what<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.380> heck<00:02:52.530> is<00:02:52.650> super<00:02:52.920> DNA<00:02:53.280> DNA<00:02:54.210> what

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
DNA what the heck is super DNA DNA what

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.760 
DNA what the heck is super DNA DNA what
they've<00:02:55.170> been<00:02:55.350> using<00:02:55.650> is<00:02:56.130> essentially<00:02:56.820> that

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
they've been using is essentially that

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.290 
they've been using is essentially that
kind<00:02:58.770> of<00:02:58.830> liquidy<00:02:59.250> component<00:02:59.850> that<00:03:00.030> runs

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
kind of liquidy component that runs

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.330 
kind of liquidy component that runs
through<00:03:00.630> like<00:03:00.930> a<00:03:00.959> river<00:03:01.290> in<00:03:01.530> some<00:03:01.800> of<00:03:01.980> roses

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
through like a river in some of roses

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.520 
through like a river in some of roses
shoes<00:03:02.670> essentially<00:03:03.510> what<00:03:03.690> I<00:03:03.930> explained<00:03:04.350> it<00:03:04.500> to

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
shoes essentially what I explained it to

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.770 
shoes essentially what I explained it to
people<00:03:04.890> was<00:03:05.070> if<00:03:05.310> you've<00:03:05.459> made<00:03:05.640> Google<00:03:06.480> home

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
people was if you've made Google home

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.840 
people was if you've made Google home
with<00:03:07.050> cornstarch<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:07.709> water<00:03:07.770> and<00:03:08.459> you<00:03:08.610> stick

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
with cornstarch and water and you stick

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.310 
with cornstarch and water and you stick
your<00:03:08.940> finger<00:03:09.270> in<00:03:09.420> it<00:03:09.450> you<00:03:09.840> can<00:03:09.959> get<00:03:10.110> through

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
your finger in it you can get through

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.380 
your finger in it you can get through
there<00:03:10.440> nice<00:03:10.620> and<00:03:10.650> soft<00:03:11.040> if<00:03:11.250> you<00:03:11.280> slap<00:03:11.700> it<00:03:11.730> it

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
there nice and soft if you slap it it

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.199 
there nice and soft if you slap it it
becomes<00:03:12.810> a<00:03:12.990> little<00:03:13.290> more<00:03:13.500> stable<00:03:14.220> across<00:03:14.970> the

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
becomes a little more stable across the

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.120 
becomes a little more stable across the
board<00:03:15.420> so<00:03:15.959> this<00:03:16.140> is<00:03:16.290> going<00:03:16.380> to<00:03:16.470> be<00:03:16.620> a<00:03:16.650> shoe<00:03:16.920> that

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
board so this is going to be a shoe that

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.180 
board so this is going to be a shoe that
for<00:03:17.340> a<00:03:17.370> gal<00:03:17.760> that<00:03:18.390> is<00:03:18.780> a<00:03:18.810> nice<00:03:19.350> light<00:03:19.709> quick

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
for a gal that is a nice light quick

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.160 
for a gal that is a nice light quick
strike<00:03:20.520> you<00:03:21.030> know<00:03:21.060> she's<00:03:21.420> gonna<00:03:21.570> feel<00:03:21.870> very

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
strike you know she's gonna feel very

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.870 
strike you know she's gonna feel very
plush<00:03:22.530> here<00:03:22.770> for<00:03:23.220> someone<00:03:23.520> like<00:03:23.640> me<00:03:23.850> that

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
plush here for someone like me that

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.850 
plush here for someone like me that
maybe<00:03:24.180> bangs<00:03:24.510> a<00:03:24.660> little<00:03:24.690> bit<00:03:24.959> more<00:03:25.170> that's

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
maybe bangs a little bit more that's

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:26.960 
maybe bangs a little bit more that's
going<00:03:26.130> to<00:03:26.220> feel<00:03:26.400> a<00:03:26.430> little<00:03:26.580> more<00:03:26.730> substantial

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
going to feel a little more substantial

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.080 
going to feel a little more substantial
to<00:03:27.420> me<00:03:27.660> and<00:03:27.810> that's<00:03:28.170> what<00:03:28.380> I<00:03:28.410> like<00:03:28.769> and<00:03:28.980> so<00:03:29.340> what

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
to me and that's what I like and so what

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.850 
to me and that's what I like and so what
they're<00:03:30.209> saying<00:03:30.510> is<00:03:30.780> they<00:03:30.989> took<00:03:31.230> that<00:03:31.530> and

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
they're saying is they took that and

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.310 
they're saying is they took that and
they<00:03:32.250> basically<00:03:32.580> mixed<00:03:33.570> it<00:03:33.690> in<00:03:33.840> with<00:03:33.870> this

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
they basically mixed it in with this

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.960 
they basically mixed it in with this
rubber<00:03:34.590> component<00:03:35.220> so<00:03:35.430> they<00:03:35.580> don't<00:03:35.790> have

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
rubber component so they don't have

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.699 
rubber component so they don't have
those<00:03:36.180> rivers<00:03:36.570> flowing<00:03:36.810> through<00:03:37.110> there<00:03:37.260> this

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
those rivers flowing through there this

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.070 
those rivers flowing through there this
