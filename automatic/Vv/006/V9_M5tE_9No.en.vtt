00:00:01.759 --> 00:00:06.319
 Mr. Komiya Hi Today's last British soft failure 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:09.319
 I would like to introduce you about the included software 

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:13.119
 First of all 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:16.869
 Mario kart wii bought b for this 

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:21.329
 It is interesting if you still play wi-fi and barre 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.730
 next 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.220
 Large scuffle smash Brothers x 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.700
 I wonder if you have this pig while eating 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.910
 It is so popular that it is soft 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.060
 This is often done if wi-fi is a place that doesn't do that much 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.460
 Eh next 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.610
 Pokemon battle dishes 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.610
 I bought this almost for the end times 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.410
 Because I like Pokemon, random battles and friends 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.410
 I am playing on the river at the hotel 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.110
 Yeah next 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.270
 At monster hunter time 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.710
 This is done with trial version of try 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.650
 Although it was for prime time saucer, it is taken and reputation 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.810
 Not too good 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.040
 I do not actually have a try 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.060
 As US charges are being demonstrated 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.950
 You are planning 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.950
 It is funny I was really addicted 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.720
 Koshiinami 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.060
 The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.760
 This is a play scene now 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.580
 Really interesting 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:49.690
 Zelda is 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.950
 I like it so much 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.159
 I'm planning on getting to know Naruto City, but this is 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.720
 I think it's more difficult than ever 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.720
 It is interesting 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.030
 The last is 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.439
 Super Mario Bros 

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:12.169
 Old age 

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:16.859
 Even if you do it in the family, it is interesting even if you do big white stones 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:18.579
 If too much too much 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:21.109
 Because I got into a fight 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:24.379
 It is not a marathon by one person alone 

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:32.279
 There are rice farming and Matsukane Yoko in England. 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.290
 If you are planning to introduce software in the current class this time 

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:40.779
 It is shallow in Mitaka because it also ups here 

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:42.309
 Thank you for it
