00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.840
 Good day to all today speech 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:15.049
 we will go about fortifications action cameras to 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.680
 slam this video will touch 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:21.330
 Not only 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:25.490
 gopro cameras also other action cameras 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:30.269
 as metallic fasteners fixing 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:36.559
 mount for fixing cameras I think everyone 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:40.440
 are the same but the set was purchased 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:43.829
 Mounts as staff quite a few 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.430
 and all two things in the kit goes to the bottom 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:54.949
 curved one straight you as one 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:58.190
 curved I already stuck on that helmet for 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:02.030
 up to complete additional shooting points 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.030
 I had to buy more 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:11.700
 stuck and one mount in the front 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:14.250
 part of the helmet and the second plan to glue in 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.810
 some side will cause a bunch of questions 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:23.070
 about how to fix the mask mask found 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:28.049
 I fix the mask I wear under the helmet 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:31.290
 pretty nice on the cap if needed 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:35.670
 take off the helmet but stay in the mask just 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:39.330
 take it off and all plus 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:42.240
 somehow she makes me so comfortable riding with 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:49.740
 player headphones mask extra 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:52.289
 fixes more earbud headphones so as not to 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.680
 translate a large number of mounts 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:54.680
 and 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.039
 either do not correct any errors 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.360
 allowed beforehand 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:09.060
 how to say so 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:13.940
 try on so when we glue and 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:17.310
 fasten fasteners I consider it necessary 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.080
 fully assemble something definite 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.980
 the design with which we are 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:26.220
 We will shoot and try on the place as 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.640
 it will be exactly the same in principle possible 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:38.160
 and check out the picture we get 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:42.530
 using a smartphone or tablet in 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:45.019
 cameras equipped with a WiFi module 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:50.570
 make it very easy ie we 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:50.570
 we connect the camera for example by phone 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.870
 here we can already 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:06.170
 see which picture we get 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:10.849
 there is a fix i will be the camera a side 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:16.200
 you can fix it approximately and 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:26.180
 using a smartphone we can watch 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:26.180
 what but in the end get what angle 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:42.510
 that is, seconds this construction 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.510
 camera turned upside down 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.690
 well, and so we fastened 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.450
 here 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.020
 i.e 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:34.750
 that is, the basic principles you like 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:37.550
 I understand I will proceed to gluing this 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:41.300
 design plus more separately wanted 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.810
 would say about what guys if you 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:47.110
 camera 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:53.990
 for 300 dollars and you appreciate her very much 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:59.390
 do not be lazy to buy and for how much there 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:00.790
 it turns out in hryvnia it's rude there 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:09.410
 by saying 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:14.350
 290 hryvnia set insure I think it 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:18.140
 worth it and the camera will stay in place and 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:20.440
 you will calmly generally proceed to 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.440
 gluing together 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:37.840
 since i have already mapped a place 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:37.840
 separate glue 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:57.860
 all here we have such here 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:06:03.639
 construction that is basically everything here 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:03.639
 governed customizable google 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:11.320
 above-below all this we can 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.320
 correct 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:21.860
 one more mount I want to attach on 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:23.690
 skiing will also be the next video of all 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:27.789
 Thank you all for watching questions 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.789
 write happy to answer bye
