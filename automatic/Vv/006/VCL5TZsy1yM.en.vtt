00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 hello together I tell you this time how 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.140
 could crochet her with pom pom transition to 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.140
 example a scarf 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:18.330
 I would have this time with raphaela of 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:21.960
 rilana and I have a 6 millimeter 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.510
 We will not start hooking this time 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.039
 a knot but only with one 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.570
 we just look for it 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.230
 a place between the 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.840
 pompons out and make a sleep as 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.550
 It can be just that way 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.320
 over each other and there comes the now 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.239
 hagen rheinland has something for me 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.360
 and look for the next one between us 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.550
 and this is where it comes from 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.030
 Can on the hook and rejected him 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.219
 all through the bend and that 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:56.579
 is our first air mesh here 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:59.340
 has arisen and now we do 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.930
 continue to air and that I use 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.860
 me always the yarn between the pompons 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.210
 I assume the next one is between 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.479
 Intermediate initially, meanwhile 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.830
 completely on the hook and me 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.390
 pull this through the bend 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:20.850
 again the next one the next 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.890
 space only through you and in case 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.020
 a star just did it now 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.040
 often to the breadth of your scarf 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.040
 is reached 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:44.020
 the name strength is with this even 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.869
 not really important should be easy 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.479
 be comfortable for you and the mesh 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.719
 picture is not strong through the needle 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.770
 strength influences 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:56.340
 but if you are not sure 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.380
 just look at the banderole 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.939
 Here is for example recommended to 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.259
 with a needle strength 6 to 7 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.069
 ok if we have our desired width 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:10.599
 We can finish here 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.310
 an air makes that is practically ours 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.900
 walls made air we always need 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.700
 in addition, every time I do that 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.640
 work is turning an air now 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.160
 Let's do the work and do it now 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.140
 It's just like us 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.519
 otherwise you are crocheting and doing 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.459
 Here we can work together 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:29.829
 we are at the beginning of the series 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.410
 not in the first but in the second 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:36.040
 mesh from the hook and that I take 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.150
 the front front the front let 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.090
 the same way 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.829
 you have the front here the behind 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.260
 or you can just take both I 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:45.790
 take the claim 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.819
 and we have our next one again 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:52.150
 space of the arrives on the hook 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.859
 we win thus now have 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.670
 now because on the tap 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:58.030
 Now let's get the next one 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:02.139
 between space escape through this 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:05.049
 let that be ours through both 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:06.430
 mass and repeat like now and 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.109
 Now we always go to the next one 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.459
 mesh so in the second wash only on 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:17.380
 at the beginning of three and otherwise always in the 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:23.290
 let thread through two next thread 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:24.180
 on the h the hollow by the two 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.269
 pull 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.650
 It was the second solid mesh again 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:33.239
 look for the next mesh 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.239
 it's me here 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:47.150
 get a bath 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:47.150
 pull the fetch through the two 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:59.330
 I think I have the back here 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:03.530
 take it again 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.530
 I wanted to do the woman 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:42.630
 if you are not sure if you are 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.860
 really have all made mesh 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.650
 that we may not be one 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.780
 have let out then counts on 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:52.050
 start when you count the air machine 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:54.330
 the at the beginning with and then at the 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.330
 then could pull the series 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.280
 number of fixed meshes 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:02.990
 just as high as the previous ones 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.990
 possibly spring had to them 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:45.970
 so we still have a chance to give the 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.620
 now arrived at the end of the series and 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.740
 as I said at the end of each 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:53.830
 row always make an air so we 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:56.650
 get the yarn back and crochet now 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.150
 an air hole and now we turn 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.050
 our work is always going to be 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:04.710
 get shorter 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:04.710
 they do not have the full breadth of it 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:11.260
 otherwise move to the left 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:14.230
 is okay and we leave now 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:20.590
 again the first mouse and stab in the 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:23.880
 second one and it came through again and 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.880
 pull it through the two 8 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:45.190
 that's all that 's what you do 

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:48.700
 when the bonbon rules can be considered if 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:50.350
 you want to develop from it with the 

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.570
 Knitting I think it goes with the yarn 

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:54.550
 a little easier but that 's all with the 

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:57.190
 crochet too well and if you then 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:59.680
 that reaches the length of your scarf 

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:03.250
 if you are at the end of the series now 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:08.830
 then you cut that 

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:10.900
 even here for example about and 

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:12.850
 then pull it through the one by the last 

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:15.370
 mesh here on the row then and 

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:17.890
 sewed still in the sound it can be 

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:19.600
 hide here very well and then pull 

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:21.669
 through the last stitch if now that 

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.440
 Here cuts for example draws 

00:07:21.669 --> 00:07:24.850
 white the two pompons through 

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.650
 maybe not so good 

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:27.520
 Pull through a frieze of through 

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:29.650
 it is also much better 

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:33.000
 yes that was it already for you 

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:33.000
 have fun when reworking
