00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
we can make this through in a decent

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.070 
we can make this through in a decent
amount<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.799> time<00:01:08.630> there<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.810> still<00:01:10.049> a

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
amount of time there is still a

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.140 
amount of time there is still a
touch-based<00:01:10.439> aspect<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.610> even<00:01:11.850> though<00:01:11.970> it

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
touch-based aspect to it even though it

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.660 
touch-based aspect to it even though it
is<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.270> race<00:01:12.540> which<00:01:13.500> kind<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:13.950> makes<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.280> harder

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
is a race which kind of makes it harder

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.660 
is a race which kind of makes it harder
and<00:01:15.259> more<00:01:16.259> fun<00:01:16.530> at<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.770> same<00:01:16.890> time<00:01:17.159> so

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
and more fun at the same time so

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.550 
and more fun at the same time so
hopefully

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.190 

I<00:01:20.619> won't<00:01:21.549> die<00:01:22.090> getting<00:01:22.509> contains<00:01:22.960> between

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
I won't die getting contains between

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:38.190 
I won't die getting contains between
what<00:01:23.619> to<00:01:23.770> do<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:37.270> as<00:01:37.600> you<00:01:37.720> can<00:01:37.840> see<00:01:37.869> it<00:01:38.049> does

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
what to do and as you can see it does

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.770 
what to do and as you can see it does
get<00:01:38.380> quite<00:01:38.560> involved<00:01:39.009> with<00:01:39.460> trying<00:01:39.670> to<00:01:40.119> do

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
get quite involved with trying to do

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.260 
get quite involved with trying to do
touch<00:01:41.259> base<00:01:41.500> stuff<00:01:41.830> and<00:01:42.070> you<00:01:42.700> know<00:01:42.729> normal

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
touch base stuff and you know normal

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.380 
touch base stuff and you know normal
game<00:01:43.509> itself<00:01:43.899> so<00:01:44.860> but<00:01:45.640> that's<00:01:45.820> a<00:01:45.909> good<00:01:46.060> thing<00:01:46.210> I

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
game itself so but that's a good thing I

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.149 
game itself so but that's a good thing I
really<00:01:46.750> enjoyed<00:01:46.780> the<00:01:47.259> aspect<00:01:47.860> of<00:01:48.039> it<00:01:48.130> that

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
really enjoyed the aspect of it that

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.309 
really enjoyed the aspect of it that
makes<00:01:48.429> it<00:01:48.520> a<00:01:48.610> bit<00:01:48.789> more<00:01:48.939> difficult<00:01:52.319> we're

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:53.319 
makes it a bit more difficult we're

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:55.320 
makes it a bit more difficult we're
doing<00:01:53.530> quite<00:01:53.709> well<00:01:53.770> because<00:01:54.100> last<00:01:54.819> time<00:01:55.000> I<00:01:55.090> got

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
doing quite well because last time I got

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.529 
doing quite well because last time I got
here<00:01:55.679> I'd<00:01:56.679> not<00:01:57.340> have<00:01:57.459> this<00:01:57.640> much<00:01:57.850> time<00:01:58.119> left<00:01:58.330> on

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
here I'd not have this much time left on

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:08.210 
here I'd not have this much time left on
the<00:01:58.659> clock<00:02:04.170> jump<00:02:05.170> over<00:02:05.409> here<00:02:05.649> hold<00:02:06.340> this<00:02:06.490> down

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
the clock jump over here hold this down

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.130 
the clock jump over here hold this down
and<00:02:09.220> quite<00:02:09.549> have<00:02:09.670> enough<00:02:09.729> jump<00:02:10.149> on<00:02:10.360> there<00:02:10.509> try

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
and quite have enough jump on there try

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.220 
and quite have enough jump on there try
it<00:02:11.200> one<00:02:11.380> more<00:02:11.440> time<00:02:11.709> and<00:02:12.810> ride<00:02:13.810> around<00:02:13.959> the

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
it one more time and ride around the

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:28.720 
it one more time and ride around the
circle<00:02:16.110> swing<00:02:17.110> through<00:02:18.750> put<00:02:19.750> this<00:02:19.870> down

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:40.800 

and<00:02:29.730> fell<00:02:30.630> through

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.480 

and<00:02:41.810> simply<00:02:42.380> coming<00:02:42.740> up<00:02:42.830> to<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.100> end<00:02:43.250> of<00:02:43.400> the

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
and simply coming up to the end of the

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.820 
and simply coming up to the end of the
level<00:02:43.720> hopefully<00:02:44.720> because<00:02:45.350> I<00:02:45.470> have<00:02:45.560> quite<00:02:45.770> a

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
level hopefully because I have quite a

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.530 
level hopefully because I have quite a
bit<00:02:45.920> of<00:02:46.040> time<00:02:46.160> left<00:02:46.310> on<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.790> clock<00:02:49.480> there's<00:02:50.480> a

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
bit of time left on the clock there's a

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:58.730 
bit of time left on the clock there's a
couple<00:02:50.750> more<00:02:51.050> challenges<00:02:51.620> to<00:02:51.740> go<00:02:51.860> through

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.080 

oh<00:03:00.110> no<00:03:01.340> you're<00:03:02.340> myself<00:03:02.670> right<00:03:02.820> into<00:03:03.000> the

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
oh no you're myself right into the

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.530 
oh no you're myself right into the
spikes<00:03:03.360> oh<00:03:04.340> well<00:03:05.340> we<00:03:05.820> can<00:03:05.850> so<00:03:06.120> probably<00:03:06.390> good

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
spikes oh well we can so probably good

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:13.700 
spikes oh well we can so probably good
piece<00:03:06.810> of<00:03:06.840> time<00:03:12.050> so<00:03:13.050> as<00:03:13.140> you<00:03:13.230> can<00:03:13.320> see<00:03:13.440> this<00:03:13.590> is

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
piece of time so as you can see this is

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.250 
piece of time so as you can see this is
more<00:03:13.920> of<00:03:13.980> a<00:03:14.130> circus-themed<00:03:15.030> level<00:03:15.450> so<00:03:15.660> the

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
more of a circus-themed level so the

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.290 
more of a circus-themed level so the
levels<00:03:16.680> in<00:03:16.860> the<00:03:16.950> beta<00:03:17.130> aren't<00:03:17.490> necessarily<00:03:17.970> in

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
levels in the beta aren't necessarily in

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.850 
levels in the beta aren't necessarily in
order<00:03:18.780> oh<00:03:19.160> that<00:03:20.160> wasn't<00:03:20.400> a<00:03:20.430> bad<00:03:20.610> time<00:03:21.650> but<00:03:22.650> they

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
order oh that wasn't a bad time but they

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.440 
order oh that wasn't a bad time but they
are<00:03:23.010> some<00:03:23.280> levels<00:03:23.700> that<00:03:23.820> probably<00:03:24.120> don't<00:03:24.300> give

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
are some levels that probably don't give

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.510 
are some levels that probably don't give
away<00:03:24.540> too<00:03:24.690> much<00:03:24.840> of<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.350> final<00:03:25.770> story<00:03:26.010> because

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
away too much of the final story because

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.100 
away too much of the final story because
even<00:03:26.790> though<00:03:26.880> there's<00:03:27.090> a<00:03:27.150> beta<00:03:27.420> they<00:03:27.960> don't

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
even though there's a beta they don't

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.660 
even though there's a beta they don't
want<00:03:28.140> to<00:03:28.290> give<00:03:28.410> away<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.770> fun<00:03:29.010> part<00:03:29.340> of<00:03:29.520> the

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
want to give away the fun part of the

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.510 
want to give away the fun part of the
story<00:03:29.970> mode<00:03:30.240> so<00:03:32.030> 99,000<00:03:33.140> 131<00:03:34.140> which<00:03:35.040> puts<00:03:35.310> us

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
story mode so 99,000 131 which puts us

story mode so 99,000 131 which puts us
in<00:03:35.760> 208<00:03:36.480> place<00:03:36.840> last<00:03:37.170> time<00:03:37.320> is<00:03:37.590> in<00:03:37.850> 357<00:03:38.850> so

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
in 208 place last time is in 357 so
