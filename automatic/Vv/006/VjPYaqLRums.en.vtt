00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 hello all how are you welcome 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.920
 new a bag today I bring you 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.710
 this that through many people who 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.940
 they are nice black doritos meters and the 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.730
 packaging is fine but let's analyze 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.590
 first the label that has outside 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.330
 is a few steps I suppose they are from the 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.660
 simpson because for obvious reasons because 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.039
 goes out there vaart then good to have 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.869
 Of course they do not have kitchens because if not 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.960
 it could not be distributed freely to 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.359
 through that sale 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.640
 climbing love does not matter that there is the 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:30.919
 label of simpson cups 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.680
 I really do not like cases of 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:35.690
 this type the only cases that have 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.730
 liked are the cases of pokemon I the 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.949
 I collected and afterwards they took us out 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.559
 no good case the pokemon cases 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.570
 of the second generation of first and 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.250
 second generation were chingones already 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.739
 then what they got was a reverend 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.320
 shit enclosed in my dynamic cock 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.089
 then the packaging is good is a 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.729
 color combination between black red 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:58.100
 and yellow there is also a little bit of white 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:00.050
 and good here comes what as are the 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.190
 abritas let's see if they show there 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:06.259
 that they are are actually going to open and 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.030
 let's go back a bit because the 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:09.860
 smell is very important of course that has 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.720
 tried many times I love them but 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.730
 let's see if they retain the charm 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.190
 because many times they are going 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.350
 the smell is attractive remember when the 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.450
 get me fresh and good if we go to 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.130
 try them I never imagined that they would last 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.470
 so much time because usually when 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.520
 they take out some test does not pass the test and 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:32.000
 they end up going extinct they did a lot 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.760
 to change the name to invent a 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.860
 Introverted man was at the beginning 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.570
 then it remained as an unknown 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.090
 that as I doubt this I think they did 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.990
 the adal ramones program then 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.990
 well let's open it 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.130
 and let's try it I'm going to try it a lot 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.170
 because unfortunately all very little 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.770
 time because it does not look good to this 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.530
 used well and good let's see one no 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.990
 focus well let's try to focus 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.700
 there is focused perfect then 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.349
 look this is the one I liked the most this 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.810
 As it has more seasoning than others 

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:07.979
 I'm going to try it this way and the others 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.019
 I'm going to have a little sauce 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.670
 valentina only I have to go for it 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.910
 then let's stop the first one here 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.910
 is 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.970
 they are good they are very rich indeed 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.640
 practically finds the evidence such 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.120
 the need to try another one because 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.120
 It is very rich 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.730
 it's delicious but good now we're going to 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.940
 stop with a little valentina sauce 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.540
 Well now let's proceed sorry 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.540
 have a little 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.010
 sorry I have a little cough but 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.650
 well I'm not going to cut it so you can see 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.450
 I'm not lying, we're going to try it with a 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.650
 little bit is like a wave we're going to 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.210
 try because I really do not talk a 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.370
 little throat and I think this gave me 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.230
 a little bit of damage then good here 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.140
 we have it is draining the sauce well 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.400
 the droplet and it looks lovely let's 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.300
 try it this way and we will take for 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.300
 finished this video 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.450
 if not 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.450
 Y 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:17.730
 no no no no if it's good but I think 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.200
 that these habits combine a little 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.630
 better with the sauce called salsa 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.180
 botanera 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.400
 I do not know if they know her 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.950
 it is better the combination is better as 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.409
 that the valentina sauce or the area is very 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.799
 rich but like this is going a little bit 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:35.719
 more with botanera sauce because it's a 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:37.219
 taste a little stronger then good 

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:38.930
 here I end with this video I hope they 

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:40.730
