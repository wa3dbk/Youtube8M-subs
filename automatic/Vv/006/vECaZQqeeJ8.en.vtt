00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:12.020
 systems are matched with a power margin in 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.530
 20 percent of calculated heat loss 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:23.149
 the whole house has the coldest winter days for 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:25.149

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.759
 screed 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.619
 we can see how it installed itself 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.850
 the system fits first 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.119
