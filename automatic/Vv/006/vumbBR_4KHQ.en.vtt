00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
which is kind of impressive because I

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.850 
which is kind of impressive because I

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
this record in the first place what we

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.040 
this record in the first place what we
get<00:02:24.020> instead<00:02:24.560> is<00:02:25.190> one<00:02:25.490> of<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:25.640> more<00:02:25.760> odd

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
get instead is one of the more odd

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.780 
get instead is one of the more odd
misfires<00:02:27.050> of<00:02:27.290> this<00:02:27.410> year<00:02:27.620> thus<00:02:27.860> far<00:02:28.190> a<00:02:28.370> record

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
misfires of this year thus far a record

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.460

with<00:02:28.910> a<00:02:28.940> lot<00:02:29.150> of<00:02:29.240> disparate<00:02:29.600> elements<00:02:29.960> and

I<00:02:33.380> think<00:02:33.500> about<00:02:33.710> it<00:02:33.890> just<00:02:34.100> simply<00:02:34.700> does<00:02:35.150> not

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
I think about it just simply does not

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.230 
I think about it just simply does not
work<00:02:36.170> at<00:02:36.470> least<00:02:36.680> for<00:02:36.920> me<00:02:37.070> and<00:02:37.310> to<00:02:37.580> explain<00:02:37.970> why

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
work at least for me and to explain why

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.640 
work at least for me and to explain why
we're<00:02:38.750> gonna<00:02:38.870> have<00:02:39.110> to<00:02:39.230> start<00:02:39.440> with<00:02:39.560> the

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
we're gonna have to start with the

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.200 
we're gonna have to start with the

instrumentation in the production which

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.810 
instrumentation in the production which
is<00:02:41.510> nowhere<00:02:42.290> near<00:02:42.530> even<00:02:42.800> any<00:02:43.160> clean<00:02:43.550> clothes
