might have to lower the action almost as

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.999 
might have to lower the action almost as
far<00:02:05.460> as<00:02:05.579> it<00:02:05.700> can<00:02:05.820> go<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.560> put<00:02:07.560> very<00:02:07.799> light

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
far as it can go and put very light

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.580 
far as it can go and put very light
strings<00:02:08.399> on<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:08.670> that's<00:02:09.300> another<00:02:09.590> part

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
strings on it that's another part

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.940 
strings on it that's another part
solution<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.610> it

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
solution to it

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.670 
solution to it
okay<00:02:12.599> with<00:02:13.599> those<00:02:13.750> words<00:02:13.990> of<00:02:14.140> advice<00:02:14.230> there's

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
okay with those words of advice there's

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.979 
okay with those words of advice there's
also<00:02:14.860> some<00:02:15.160> technique<00:02:15.550> things<00:02:15.849> this<00:02:16.690> is<00:02:16.870> the

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
also some technique things this is the

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.900 
also some technique things this is the
