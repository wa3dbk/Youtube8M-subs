00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.980
 and so guys all hello work process 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:12.769
 we just decided to show you how not 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:15.929
 need to do in this case 209 body 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.520
 was once 320 put into it 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.650
 mg compressor 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.289
 Moreover, they put the compressor 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.869
 tried it and set up the most that 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.849
 scary and that's what it means came out by 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.010
 fact did not naturally do it and you 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.850
 you understand because we would never 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:36.690
 didn't show started this here inlet 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.550
 look at this inlet absolutely 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.649
 custom see 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.000
 out of some kind of penis of this 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.579
 material here means flow meter from 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.360
 some 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:55.489
 from dvenashki hike so good not bad 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.960
 so we go further we go further filter 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.719
 filter 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.129
 Russian Federation Filter here so here 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.449
 it takes all that is in the standard 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.270
 take the car from two sides here 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.470
 takes in on one side and 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.640
 accordingly, that's the diameter of all 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.350
 the whole system is out 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.689
 count on more power on 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.380
 so in the start is impossible to those who are not in 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.840
 course we go further gentlemen where is our 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.950
 let the throttle look see what 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:27.090
 wonderful seal throttle all 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:30.000
 in the best traditions of AvtoVAZ although here 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.869
 it seems like they shouldn't smell like AvtoVAZ 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.869
 Here is this fitting me very pleased here 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.140
 this one can see how everything is made 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:45.600
 qualitatively 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:50.370
 it's a choke ode stub town 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:55.200
 temperature straight all alas all in oil 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:58.800
 naturally and what he looks like he goes on 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:02.330
 8 streams in general, but firstly what is it 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:08.190
 the quality where did it come from 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:09.479
 This is the first transformer campaign and here 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.510
 accordingly, the belt is not yours either 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.210
 The belt should be suitable for 8 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.610
 brooks suspended belt on 6 in general 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:21.140
 the whole system is so made snake clemen 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:24.810
 yes but it's ok it's half the trouble 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.670
 means as characterized by good or 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.950
 bad master you know and I'll tell you 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.130
 how is it when you are in the car 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.310
 then find some things like u 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:39.020
 Surgeons know stitched scissors random 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.020
 here, too, look what we find 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:46.490
 Screwdriver see what seems to be bitten 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.650
 in some processes involved clearly not 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.040
 useful for the engine was lying around somewhere 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.290
 there was something inside of her somewhere 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.970
 screwdriver guys screwdriver 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.010
 this standard story yes all sorts of things 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:03.410
 and it's not in the whale's pallet somewhere there 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:05.270
 In precisely in engine this horror damn 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:09.470
 poor car even look candles 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:12.350
 this is how you can do so they do 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.060
 not only is it clear in what condition 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:18.470
 such not 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.110
 firstly all different different types of different 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.110
 marks 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:26.050
 in short, it's just tin 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.600
 It seems to me that you can not just 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:31.720
 mock such machines is great 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.690
 car why are you doing it at all just 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.340
 brought the car in terrible condition 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.980
 now you have to fix it somehow 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.960
 so that you at least like that more or less 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.910
 looked like 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:45.430
 please do not hold the tuning of the 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.560
 more cars like mercedes for example 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.570
 if you donâ€™t understand what it is 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.520
 may you ask why this 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.010
 we have a car 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:55.200
 we will not rule through people 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.970
 who made 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.220
 they tried to do naturally not 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.440
 Were able to adjust because all this 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.750
 setting your forehead somewhere somewhere somewhere 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.270
 sticking something naturally nothing 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.250
 will not go so we will not do anything 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.500
 correct the owners so we just 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.130
 set up we will make we set up 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:17.560
 she probably will go 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:19.450
 this is a lyrical digression completely 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.600
 wait for the new vacuum cleaner series soon 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.490
 there will be new series as well 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.220
 spring is coming soon 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:29.200
 here is a plus other projects and interesting 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:32.140
 also follow everything thank you very much for 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:36.390
 This mini reviewer of one of ours 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.390
 client cars yet
