00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 Hello everyone, and today I am too much 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:07.859
 happy because I make you one of the 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:10.740
 recipes that come with the children at levels 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.809
 I'm joking about the restaurant 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.039
 risotto you make that there are billions of 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.449
 recipes with precise recipes with children 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.130
 with risotto on all the others 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.539
 dishes of the world for risotto 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.789
 really picks up one of the most things 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.320
 surprising because it does everything by itself not 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.769
 we must not even shoot it of course 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.420
 because the bimby amalgamates it during 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.850
 cooking alone and is in a risotto 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.250
 creamy from the fabulous restaurant and there 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.050
 do as hell do you want with a few 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.930
 fat you decide everything comes by now 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.579
 always creamy fantastic and i go 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.590
 crazy I do it in every way I have 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.250
 put eat more rice than pasta then 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:50.579
 let's start by turning on the bimby 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.520
 let's get out the extension in the 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.960
 taken as always then the bimby yes 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.510
 turns on 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:05.330
 Let's start by inserting a peeled shallot 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:10.760
 obviously in the bowl 5 seconds 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.760
 speed 720 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:21.680
 and here I show you how 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:26.710
 how it is practically reduced shallots 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:32.860
 and now with my spatula and I go to 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:35.510
 push the chop on the bottom of the bimby 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:39.530
 let's put the lid back on 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:42.740
 mug and voila and add the 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.600
 margarine obviously now we do 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.300
 so our sautÃ©ed that between 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.590
 the other will never be fried because the 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.810
 bimby reaches a maximum temperature 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.170
 of 100 degrees then the onion yes 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:57.350
 will hear will be cooked perfectly will have a 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.490
 perfume a delicate flavor but never 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.630
 fried 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.840
 so the taste will be even more 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.580
 amplified but not annoying it will be cooked 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.140
 in short, you have to find it has nothing to do with it 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:11.590
 do you know we create ours 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:17.500
 our ceiling then 100 g 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.500
 speed tremors though 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.930
 here he deviates ended we seek the 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.670
 open lid okay no need 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.330
 to open but I'll show you ours 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.580
 goal is good 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.290
 now we pour the rice I repeat 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.879
 put a recipe no info boss for 4 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.180
 people but I love you same in I am 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:43.340
 so it will weigh me down let's say what I do 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.129
 150 200 grams less and eat well 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.700
 200 of rice because we do too good 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:52.819
 100 150 per hour the budget function 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:56.420
 how it works key balance wait 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:03:00.019
 that zero arrives here is always the 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:04.700
 We usually wait a little while e 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:08.090
 the scale you give me see I stop a 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.879
 moment so it gives me 80 grams that puts us 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.849
 23 seconds to weigh even pay 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:15.859
 we risk putting less and 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:20.720
 play a bit spitichi e 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:24.560
 mouthfuls 140 let's take 150 and let's do 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.120
 toast the rice then we go around three 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.459
 minutes to make minutes you crush 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:32.510
 first less and then more 100 degrees 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.519
 let's put it counter-clockwise that practically 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.230
 the anti-clockwise movement of the blades in the 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:41.540
 knives group that does not forgive 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:42.830
 laughed mind speed 1 but the play 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.990
 just courage 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:51.890
 here we are on the open lid e 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:55.100
 We pour the wine in the white wine we 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.380
 dry, of course, I always put the hair down 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:02.300
 in the budget to understand how much but 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:04.400
 however we see is then hold 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.100
 present that I am always doing alone 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.580
 for me I also put a nice 50 that me 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:12.170
 like it so here we clear the 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.180
 balance the anti- clock function you see 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.720
 that still inserted we put a hundred grave 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:20.750
 until they are not recapped 15 they are not 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:24.200
 disarms 100 gr of anti functions 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:29.180
 one minute speed 1 time and we do 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:32.870
 fade everything is finished also to fade 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:36.650
 now we pay and therefore we pay 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:40.730
 water always in the tank sorry that 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:46.220
 I see the weight again let's pour 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:47.930
 boiling water in the bowl like this 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.820
 quietly even if you go here for 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.220
 say can therefore not be done so 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.140
 that the water does not fall there 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.180
 worried there is though for the 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.760
 water speed you see it transcends 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.590
 now let's put half a nut in half 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.169
 vegetable nut you can too 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.419
 replace this operation with del 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:07.370
 boiling broth already prepared and then in 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:10.160
 theory another thing at this stage 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.990
 you should salt as you like I do not put 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.060
 salt added aside the data because not 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.330
 i'm interested the same is good e 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:20.890
 let's go 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:26.090
 we can cook the time 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:28.280
 so I'm the recipe says 14 15 minutes 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.110
 however, I noticed that an extra minute a 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.000
 second of the rice is because it took rice 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.169
 basmati need a bit more then I do not know 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.470
 I do it even with basmati not 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:40.800
 however, it generally affects risottos 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:43.440
 minutes indicated in the 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.270
 in the recipe book for the moment always 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:49.379
 minutes no longer because I still like it 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:52.770
 more cooked rice and always 100 degrees of 

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:56.430
 we set and 16 minutes counterclockwise 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:06:02.940
 spoon speed and then item without 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:05.069
 no need to say that as 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.360
 we mix that we take care of the risotto 

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:09.120
 crucial to professor now 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.400
 we will also add the saffron we can 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.259
 add by invitation or who 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.539
 prefers to dissolve it first in water 

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:17.879
 in short, I think that is fine 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:19.650
 which I tried experimentally added 

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:23.060
 therefore also in this phase therefore 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:29.240
 let's add the chats only here 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:32.219
 elections will bring red throne is good 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.629
 and who wants to add some pepper 

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:36.569
 I always prefer the end now 

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:39.449
 our wines cruise for recipes in which 

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:41.400
 I will only have to play axles 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:42.930
 do that one made another and then of 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:48.090
 stalin and Milanese risotto we bend 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:50.550
 hi read and here's some ours 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:55.560
 of rent of pleasure the risotto less than 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:59.849
 eating less from the floor is mobilized vi 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:04.099
 let's see if I'm messing up 

00:06:59.849 --> 00:07:04.099
 then we remove local 

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:12.410
 here we take the cardinal off to the side 

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:14.990
 I wanted to say now with the video not 

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:16.849
 I can say so ok 

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:19.630
 Yay 

00:07:16.849 --> 00:07:23.140
 to come 

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:24.850
 if you look what you guys tell me 

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:31.300
 if this is not a wonder of 

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:34.330
 risotto now I put some pepper and 

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:38.590
 me the great one took out the rest then with 

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:40.900
 a spatula liu xiaobo joke yet 

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:43.750
 the video that we still understand each other 

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:46.150
 wait until i clean the parades that 

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:47.620
 wonder and I guarantee you that it is one 

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:51.540
 infinite goodness 

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:51.540
 hi good health to the next
