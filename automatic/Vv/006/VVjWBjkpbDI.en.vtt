00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.370
 and good to all and welcome to the 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.050
 second race of the 2015 season of 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.480
 Formula-1 and about the grand prize of 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.700
 malaysia a career in which the 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.130
 strategy has been the key to the 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.310
 victory of vettel and where ferrari has 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.920
 been completely successful in his 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.350
 strategy and this the truth that it costs 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.140
 to believe but if ferrari has given today with 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.599
 the key to the strategy and well that's not 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.730
 it's all because they have also had a 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.290
 impressive pace both vettel as 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.050
 raikkonen throughout the weekend 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.790
 and well the best to analyze this 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.399
 career I think he will do it for 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.730
 teams so as I say in we're going to 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.590
 start with ferrari in this case first 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.110
 position for vettel and fourth for 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.340
 raikkonen I said a strategy 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.050
 perfect 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.360
 vettel has been consistent during 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.820
 the whole raikkonen race has had that 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.859
 prick at the beginning has lost 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.750
 a lot of time but in the end he has 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.150
 managed to overcome and reach the fourth 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.210
 position and that speaks 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:09.870
 how well is ferrari this season 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:13.380
 and this seems like a mess but it's 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:17.220
 well a lot of years without coming up with the 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:21.870
 key and he just leaves the team they throw 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.780
 a half technical team also bring 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.900
 new people 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.990
 Of course that's new sap for the team 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.540
 and the truth that this year's car 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.460
 It looks very good and especially the 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.000
 engine the engine has been the key the year 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.450
 past they did not have a good engine and this 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.150
 year yes and that together with a new team 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.730
 technical 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:49.360
 the improvements they have made in a car and 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:51.550
 otherwise it leads to them fighting in 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.520
 this great prize almost hand in hand with 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.890
 Mercedes 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.840
 and the truth that I know badly by alonso 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.200
 because after enough year in that 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:05.250
 team trying to do feats goes and 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:08.369
 he who replaces him has that fortune 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.009
 but well we already know that vettel there 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.470
 pilots who throughout his career 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.010
 sports are giving the moment 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:19.500
 right at the right place and something like that 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.170
 it's just the opposite that it's going to 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.200
 to do it was already luckily in the 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.959
 2005-2006 season on the successful site 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:32.930
 and from there they have been doing 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:37.220
 things and well let's hope that mclaren 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.870
 can improve each grand prize and 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.560
 at least at the end of the season 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.810
 It is done 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.790
 a decent position for the year that 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.610
 comes mostly I 'll start from the 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.989
 principle with second and third options 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.989
 has been hamilton and rosberg with mercedes 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.020
 mercedes has had good pace during 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:00.680
 all weekend since they have been 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.330
 put one minute to the fifth that has been 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.700
 boots is to say that the mercedes has 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.530
 spent on his line and the victory of 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.050
 Ferrari means that it has been for 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.880
 merits of the team and the 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.180
 management especially of tires to 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.940
 the time of the strategies and that speaks 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.250
 that this year will be the 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.080
 possibility that in certain careers 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.320
 Ferrari may be struggling with 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.790
 mercedes yes today if there was not 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.790
 past the safety car 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.190
 I believe that hamilton was almost 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.670
 sure the victory but good they have 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.530
 given thus the things 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.209
 It was also time for 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.599
 someone broke the Mercedes streak 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:43.569
 so as I say ferrari mercedes there 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:46.930
 we have them practically at par and 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.670
 then from behind it comes 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.760
 a series of teams that are 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:55.209
 practically equal that would be 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:57.700
 williams bull rosso red bull lotus a 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.920
 tad more back already sauber and force india 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.219
 and williams has been fifth and sixth with 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.109
 boots and more williams for me pretty 

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:07.930
 disappointing this season I expected 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:09.939
 more of them seventh and eighth has been 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.739
 your penning and carlos sainz is 

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:13.540
 amazing rosso bull are by 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:16.720
 in front of his older brothers the 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:19.780
 redbull and both carlos and destapen 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.220
 rookies in this season are doing 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.770
 an exceptional job 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.410
 ricciardo and key beat ninth and tenth 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.630
 closing the positions of points with a 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.009
 red bull pretty disappointing I keep 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.830
 maintaining that they are very penalized 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:34.449
 with that renault engine but also what 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.690
 It takes rosso bull so they do not have 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:39.430
 excuse to be so behind and today 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.070
 it also seemed that they had enough 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.690
 problems with the brakes so we'll see 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.970
 in the next big Chinese prize that 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.400
 It is also a demanding circuit with 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.820
 strong braking in eleventh position 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:55.120
 gross yang 12th has been born 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:57.370
 and then the two force india with pérez 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.100
 and hülkenberg force india that this year 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.810
 it's pretty bad and then the two 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.210
 mclaren because he spends you in some worse and 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.700
 that despite going with the power 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.560
 unlimited have had two problems in 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.140
 their cars and they have had to abandon 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.150
 even so this weekend has been seen 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.940
 that have cut differences with the 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:18.880
 head so we'll see if for China already 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.410
 little by little the thing goes better and also 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.710
 congratulate energy that has gotten 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:25.120
 finish the race with your hands like this 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.220
 that nothing here ends the video I hope 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.400
 that you liked a greeting and even the 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.400
 next 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:41.190
 O well
