00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:06.910
 hello dear friends welcome to me 

00:00:03.489 --> 00:00:09.999
 channel my name is written today 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:14.440
 I 'm going to show you a video to remove 

00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:17.260
 or decrease by 90% the spots on the 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.599
 hands or in other places that you 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:23.679
 have good spots that's what we're going 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:27.970
 to use is the the wonderful honey of 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:30.070
 pure bee and our peanut butter 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.259
 I rather tell them about this 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.629
 product in other videos because it 's 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.239
 miraculous is very good and I love it and 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:38.920
 apart it's delicious that what 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.850
 we need our peanut butter 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:46.180
 our honey a cow bowl no 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.219
 good a bowl and a spoon 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.289
 plastic I receive preferably 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:53.710
 special plastic for your 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:57.039
 masks because if they are used from 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.710
 metal like this sometimes they make it 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:01.840
 lose the properties however the 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.970
 classic make a neutral product is not going to 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.910
 absorb does not go 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:10.000
 change the components that you have sum 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:12.640
 your mask all the benefits well 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.670
 I show them each for example I do not know if 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.400
 is that it is notorious I have here some 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.010
 little good spots as well as this 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.040
 I have several on my skin that is not going 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.800
 to distinguish enough to is well can 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.110
 see that I have a little dark skin 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:34.150
 and it's because of not using sunscreen 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:36.040
 look they can show you how it is that 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.190
 I have some freckles spots that 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.950
 normally this is these girls is not 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.440
 normal is not normal to have freckles this is 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.140
 a sign of a possible onset of cancer 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.150
 the eye skin to be careful is why 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.580
 I always recommend you use a 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.490
 blocker or sunscreen in this 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.560
 case I use this already depends on 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.160
 you use the brand that you 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.670
 wish 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:03.369
 ok now let's start with the 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.159
 mask that I have to remove or 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.700
 decrease them 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:10.099
 freckles on the hands on the arms in the 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.670
 legs in the place that you want 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:16.220
 maybe on the shoulders at the neckline in 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.470
 the neck where you consider 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.599
 they have those spots and they want 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.930
 remove them well what we are going to use 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:26.849
 as I already told you the peanut butter 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.560
 It depends on how much you 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:34.540
 need me for example I'm going to use 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:36.939
 a spoonful and echo to me container 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.800
 with a teaspoon of butter 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:44.080
 peanut 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:49.690
 well I close so that it does not get contaminated and 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:52.800
 one a pinch of honey bee well 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.800
 let's see is a little nothing more there 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.740
 It would also be like a good spoonful 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:02.250
 today we are manucho 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.250
 already 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:10.750
 I already get soiled with all this delight of 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:13.540
 honey well now what we are going to do is 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.120
 just remove what are products 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.240
 natural resources is difficult or impossible 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.490
 do badly I doubt it enough but you're 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.260
 ways you like can consult with 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:26.500
 your dermatologist to see if it is that you 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:31.240
 indicates that yes or not well what we are going 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:34.150
 to do now is with this mask that 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.340
 we already have prepared you do not need anything 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.170
 the more you need the lemon you do not need 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.400
 Baking soda does not need anything 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.010
 more than this 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:46.090
 eye do not agree maybe other things I 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:49.930
 I think it's enough and I'm using your 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:53.470
 mask and have it for 5 minutes and 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.690
 then they remove it with cotton and 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.840
 let rest another 5 minutes and you're done 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:02.350
 well dear friends this is fine 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.240
 practical I recommend them and I hope that 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.680
 they put it into practice and if they 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.409
 it stays so it is not cut 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.269

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:13.609
