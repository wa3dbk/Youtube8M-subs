I<00:03:35.520> would<00:03:36.520> think<00:03:36.700> the<00:03:36.910> Disney<00:03:37.270> would<00:03:37.450> take

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
I would think the Disney would take

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.690 
I would think the Disney would take
steps<00:03:38.080> to<00:03:38.410> make<00:03:38.650> sure<00:03:38.680> that<00:03:39.340> if<00:03:39.490> they're

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
steps to make sure that if they're

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.210 
steps to make sure that if they're
allowing<00:03:40.480> this<00:03:40.930> you<00:03:41.260> know<00:03:41.350> Pandora's<00:03:41.770> Box<00:03:42.070> to
