way which although I probably should

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:38.299

go
it<00:01:35.700> looks<00:01:35.940> pretty<00:01:36.180> lame<00:01:36.600> on<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:36.990> camera<00:01:37.320> it

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
it looks pretty lame on this camera it

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.130 
it looks pretty lame on this camera it
doesn't<00:01:38.460> look<00:01:38.550> very<00:01:38.760> realistic<00:01:39.240> either<00:01:42.050> and<00:01:43.050> I

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
doesn't look very realistic either and I

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.180 
doesn't look very realistic either and I
don't<00:01:43.200> know<00:01:43.410> what<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.590> was<00:01:43.740> doing<00:01:43.979> with<00:01:44.100> the

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
don't know what I was doing with the

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.550 
don't know what I was doing with the
photo<00:01:44.520> either<00:01:44.850> cuz<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:45.900> say<00:01:46.080> I<00:01:46.110> kind<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.410> just

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
photo either cuz I say I kind of just

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.490 
photo either cuz I say I kind of just
made<00:01:46.650> it<00:01:46.890> every<00:01:47.490> if<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.729> see<00:01:49.100> wait<00:01:50.100> here<00:01:50.370> we<00:01:50.460> go

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
made it every if you see wait here we go

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.590 
made it every if you see wait here we go
yeah<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:52.860> thought<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.640> think<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:54.060> was<00:01:54.240> okay<00:01:54.540> but

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
yeah I thought I think that was okay but

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.180 
yeah I thought I think that was okay but
then<00:01:54.900> I<00:01:54.930> made<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.170> black<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.680> white<00:01:55.740> for<00:01:56.010> some

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
then I made it black and white for some

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
then I made it black and white for some
reason<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:57.110> in<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.170> Hawaiian<00:01:58.880> area<00:01:59.880> I<00:01:59.940> don't

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
reason and in a Hawaiian area I don't

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.190 
reason and in a Hawaiian area I don't
think<00:02:00.420> that's<00:02:00.540> really<00:02:00.720> appropriate

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
think that's really appropriate

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.660 
think that's really appropriate
I<00:02:01.259> should<00:02:01.440> have<00:02:01.530> kind<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.860> increased<00:02:02.580> the

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
I should have kind of increased the

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.190 
I should have kind of increased the
saturation<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.630> made<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:04.020> look<00:02:04.140> really

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
saturation and made it look really

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.810

it<00:02:53.640> came<00:02:53.790> out<00:02:54.000> for<00:02:54.810> about<00:02:54.989> two<00:02:55.140> years<00:02:55.170> now<00:02:55.440> I

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
it came out for about two years now I

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.160 
it came out for about two years now I
think<00:02:55.769> the<00:02:55.950> last<00:02:56.100> game<00:02:56.310> was<00:02:56.549> brink<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.330> if

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
think the last game was brink and if

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.539 
think the last game was brink and if
you've<00:02:58.320> played<00:02:58.530> brink<00:02:58.920> you<00:02:58.980> will<00:02:59.130> know<00:02:59.280> why

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
you've played brink you will know why

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.660 
you've played brink you will know why
that<00:03:00.420> was<00:03:00.570> a<00:03:00.600> bit<00:03:00.810> disappointing<00:03:01.500> and<00:03:01.739> it's

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
that was a bit disappointing and it's

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.340 
that was a bit disappointing and it's
probably<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.150> reason<00:03:03.299> I've<00:03:03.630> kind<00:03:03.959> of<00:03:04.080> stopped

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
probably the reason I've kind of stopped

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.770 
probably the reason I've kind of stopped

do<00:03:53.019> this<00:03:53.140> Chung's<00:03:53.410> because<00:03:53.650> I<00:03:53.680> thought<00:03:53.980> it<00:03:54.100> was

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
do this Chung's because I thought it was

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
I just think it looks pretty cool pretty

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.539 
I just think it looks pretty cool pretty
clean<00:04:12.599> so<00:04:13.599> I<00:04:13.630> I<00:04:14.349> think<00:04:14.769> that<00:04:15.040> one<00:04:15.280> was<00:04:15.400> the<00:04:15.459> best

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
clean so I I think that one was the best

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:20.120 
clean so I I think that one was the best
one<00:04:15.760> the<00:04:16.000> one<00:04:16.120> back<00:04:16.470> there<00:04:17.470> we<00:04:17.560> go

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
Lighting's very good for this image but

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.469 
Lighting's very good for this image but

when I get my new digital SLR camera in

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.870 
when I get my new digital SLR camera in
about<00:04:34.360> two<00:04:34.630> months<00:04:34.900> time<00:04:35.550> but<00:04:36.550> I<00:04:36.580> don't<00:04:36.789> know

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
about two months time but I don't know

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.340 
about two months time but I don't know
if<00:04:36.970> I'll<00:04:37.060> just<00:04:37.210> use<00:04:37.810> one<00:04:38.020> of<00:04:38.050> my<00:04:38.200> other

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
if I'll just use one of my other

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:39.900 
if I'll just use one of my other
channels<00:04:38.740> or<00:04:39.010> create<00:04:39.039> a<00:04:39.460> new<00:04:39.640> channel

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
channels or create a new channel

channels or create a new channel
specifically<00:04:40.750> for<00:04:40.990> photography<00:04:41.500> when<00:04:41.950> I<00:04:41.979> do

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
specifically for photography when I do

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.400 
specifically for photography when I do
that<00:04:42.400> if<00:04:42.610> you<00:04:43.300> want<00:04:43.479> to<00:04:43.539> see<00:04:43.660> that<00:04:43.810> let<00:04:44.169> me<00:04:44.200> know

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
that if you want to see that let me know

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.610 
that if you want to see that let me know
but<00:04:44.710> I<00:04:45.030> doubt<00:04:46.030> interest<00:04:46.720> it's<00:04:47.020> not<00:04:47.229> really

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
but I doubt interest it's not really

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.219 
but I doubt interest it's not really
gaming<00:04:48.160> related<00:04:48.340> is<00:04:48.700> it<00:04:48.880> so<00:04:49.120> I<00:04:49.360> doubt<00:04:49.990> that's

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:50.229 
gaming related is it so I doubt that's

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:52.050 
gaming related is it so I doubt that's
appropriate<00:04:50.740> so<00:04:51.100> I'll<00:04:51.190> probably<00:04:51.340> just<00:04:51.550> posted

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
appropriate so I'll probably just posted

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.210 
appropriate so I'll probably just posted
