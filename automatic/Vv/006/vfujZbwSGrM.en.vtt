00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
in this video we're gonna talk about a

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.759 
in this video we're gonna talk about a
modular<00:00:10.710> table<00:00:11.099> that<00:00:11.219> I<00:00:11.250> built<00:00:11.580> for<00:00:11.929> $25<00:00:12.929> a

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
modular table that I built for $25 a

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.289 
modular table that I built for $25 a
little<00:00:14.219> starter<00:00:14.610> there<00:00:14.759> and<00:00:14.940> I'll<00:00:15.030> explain

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
little starter there and I'll explain

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.000 
little starter there and I'll explain
that<00:00:15.360> in<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.630> second<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:16.170> I'm<00:00:16.650> gonna<00:00:16.740> do<00:00:16.890> this

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
that in a second and I'm gonna do this

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.930 
that in a second and I'm gonna do this
in<00:00:17.190> three<00:00:17.460> parts

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
in three parts

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.490 
in three parts
the<00:00:18.090> first<00:00:18.300> one<00:00:18.449> will<00:00:18.570> be<00:00:18.600> materials<00:00:19.199> the

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
the first one will be materials the

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.220 
the first one will be materials the
second<00:00:19.800> will<00:00:19.920> be<00:00:20.039> showing<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:21.270> assembly<00:00:22.050> and

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
second will be showing the assembly and

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.230 
second will be showing the assembly and
third<00:00:22.560> will<00:00:22.740> be<00:00:22.859> doing<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.369> final<00:00:23.880> painting

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
third will be doing the final painting

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.759 
third will be doing the final painting
and<00:00:24.420> flocking<00:00:25.340> so<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:27.529> Astrix<00:00:28.529> there's

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
and flocking so the the Astrix there's

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.679 
and flocking so the the Astrix there's
four<00:00:29.070> your<00:00:29.310> mileage<00:00:29.609> may<00:00:29.640> vary<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:30.240> purchased

of<00:00:32.160> materials<00:00:32.690> and<00:00:33.690> I'll<00:00:33.780> explain<00:00:34.110> that<00:00:34.260> in<00:00:34.320> a

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
of materials and I'll explain that in a

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.350 
of materials and I'll explain that in a
bit<00:00:34.590> but<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:35.219> had<00:00:35.370> access<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.760> other<00:00:35.940> things<00:00:36.239> I

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
bit but I had access to other things I

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.229 
bit but I had access to other things I
didn't<00:00:36.570> have<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.899> completely<00:00:37.469> use<00:00:37.710> up<00:00:38.059> if<00:00:39.059> you

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
didn't have to completely use up if you

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.580 
didn't have to completely use up if you
were<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.510> have<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.780> buy<00:00:40.020> everything<00:00:40.379> from

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
were to have to buy everything from

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.440 
were to have to buy everything from
scratch<00:00:40.950> you'll<00:00:41.850> probably<00:00:41.940> cost<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.390> about

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
scratch you'll probably cost you about

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.690 
scratch you'll probably cost you about

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.049 
modular fit together and here's a couple
different<00:00:56.699> configurations<00:00:58.250> okay<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.579> what<00:01:00.030> I

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059

handy panels and there are 277 Canadian
plus<00:01:06.510> tax<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.140> what<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.130> MDF<00:01:08.700> board

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
plus tax and what it is is MDF board

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.520 
plus tax and what it is is MDF board
that's<00:01:09.330> quarter-inch<00:01:09.810> thick<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.229> it's<00:01:10.350> 2

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
that's quarter-inch thick and it's 2

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.370 
that's quarter-inch thick and it's 2
feet<00:01:10.770> by<00:01:11.220> 2<00:01:11.250> feet<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:12.180> needed<00:01:12.840> six<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.200> those

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
feet by 2 feet so I needed six of those

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.760 
feet by 2 feet so I needed six of those
I<00:01:13.760> was<00:01:14.760> also<00:01:14.880> considering<00:01:15.330> using<00:01:15.570> these<00:01:15.869> stone

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
I was also considering using these stone

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.010 
I was also considering using these stone
spray<00:01:17.280> things<00:01:17.580> they're<00:01:18.390> about<00:01:18.540> 12<00:01:18.810> dollars

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
spray things they're about 12 dollars

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.010 
spray things they're about 12 dollars
each<00:01:19.409> plus<00:01:20.100> tax

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
each plus tax

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.710 
each plus tax
again<00:01:22.020> this<00:01:22.500> would<00:01:22.650> be<00:01:22.770> pretty<00:01:23.310> cool<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:24.119> use

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
again this would be pretty cool to use

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.740 
again this would be pretty cool to use
and<00:01:25.170> give<00:01:25.770> me<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:26.189> head<00:01:26.939> start<00:01:27.180> on<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.420> painting

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
and give me a head start on the painting

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.630 
and give me a head start on the painting
but<00:01:27.900> for<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.590> price<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:28.829> this<00:01:29.070> project<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.549> was

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
but for the price of this project I was

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.200 
but for the price of this project I was
a<00:01:29.700> bit<00:01:29.850> too<00:01:29.970> steep<00:01:30.240> for<00:01:30.270> my<00:01:31.820> for<00:01:32.820> my<00:01:32.939> choices

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
a bit too steep for my for my choices

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.090 
a bit too steep for my for my choices
okay<00:01:33.840> so<00:01:33.900> those<00:01:34.409> are<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.650> couple<00:01:34.770> different

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
okay so those are a couple different

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.740 
okay so those are a couple different
options<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.610> saw<00:01:35.790> some<00:01:36.390> of<00:01:36.450> these<00:01:36.540> look

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
options that I saw some of these look

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.280 
options that I saw some of these look
great

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
great

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.990 
great
they'll<00:01:37.560> be<00:01:37.650> great<00:01:37.770> for<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.159> tomb<00:01:38.460> Kings<00:01:38.759> type

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
they'll be great for a tomb Kings type

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.109 
they'll be great for a tomb Kings type
board<00:01:39.270> or<00:01:40.070> you<00:01:41.070> know<00:01:41.159> there's<00:01:41.369> granite<00:01:41.909> type

five dollars for a bottle it's about a
liter<00:04:49.400> size<00:04:49.700> I<00:04:50.060> think<00:04:50.120> it<00:04:50.360> is<00:04:50.480> and<00:04:51.250> what<00:04:52.250> it<00:04:52.370> is

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
liter size I think it is and what it is

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.120 
liter size I think it is and what it is
is<00:04:52.730> it's<00:04:52.970> actually<00:04:53.120> acrylic<00:04:53.750> medium<00:04:54.200> so<00:04:54.830> I<00:04:54.860> use

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
is it's actually acrylic medium so I use

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.860 
is it's actually acrylic medium so I use
that<00:04:55.160> to<00:04:55.520> seal<00:04:55.790> everything<00:04:56.030> when<00:04:56.390> I<00:04:56.420> was<00:04:56.630> done

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
that to seal everything when I was done

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.360 
that to seal everything when I was done
I<00:04:57.080> use<00:04:57.860> a<00:04:57.890> spray<00:04:58.310> bottle<00:04:58.550> for<00:04:58.880> that<00:05:00.160> and<00:05:01.160> it

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
I use a spray bottle for that and it

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:02.440 
I use a spray bottle for that and it
gives<00:05:01.520> you<00:05:01.610> a<00:05:01.640> bit<00:05:01.730> of<00:05:01.760> a<00:05:01.850> glossy<00:05:02.030> finish<00:05:02.210> so

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
gives you a bit of a glossy finish so

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:03.910

you<00:05:02.600> can<00:05:02.810> take<00:05:03.050> that<00:05:03.170> down<00:05:03.380> with<00:05:03.590> it<00:05:03.680> just<00:05:03.830> a

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:03.920 
you can take that down with it just a

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.070 
you can take that down with it just a
quick<00:05:04.100> spray<00:05:04.430> of<00:05:04.580> a<00:05:04.640> matte<00:05:04.820> finish<00:05:05.030> after<00:05:05.600> but

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
quick spray of a matte finish after but

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.450 
quick spray of a matte finish after but
what<00:05:06.230> it<00:05:06.320> does<00:05:06.440> is<00:05:06.590> a<00:05:06.620> cheap<00:05:06.950> way<00:05:07.130> to<00:05:07.160> seal

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
what it does is a cheap way to seal

everything in with a clear finish you

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.210 
everything in with a clear finish you
could<00:05:10.010> also<00:05:10.160> use<00:05:10.550> water<00:05:11.390> to<00:05:11.480> cool<00:05:11.630> down<00:05:11.810> glue

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
could also use water to cool down glue

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.440 
could also use water to cool down glue
but<00:05:13.220> I<00:05:13.250> found<00:05:13.460> this<00:05:13.640> was<00:05:13.790> really<00:05:14.120> easy<00:05:14.240> to

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
but I found this was really easy to

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.350 
but I found this was really easy to
spray<00:05:14.830> okay<00:05:15.830> and<00:05:16.280> so<00:05:16.550> the<00:05:16.640> tools<00:05:16.880> that<00:05:17.120> I

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
spray okay and so the tools that I

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.410 
spray okay and so the tools that I
needed<00:05:17.630> so<00:05:18.350> I<00:05:18.380> used<00:05:18.560> an<00:05:18.650> exacto<00:05:19.040> knife<00:05:19.220> to<00:05:20.060> cut
