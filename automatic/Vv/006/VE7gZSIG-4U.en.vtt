elevated tank the pump trips which will

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.999 
elevated tank the pump trips which will
quickly<00:01:16.820> lower<00:01:17.180> the<00:01:17.450> pressure<00:01:17.860> you<00:01:18.860> have<00:01:18.920> a

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
quickly lower the pressure you have a

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:20.859 
quickly lower the pressure you have a
check<00:01:19.310> valve<00:01:19.340> this<00:01:19.850> will<00:01:20.060> shut<00:01:20.360> you'll<00:01:20.689> get

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
check valve this will shut you'll get

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:23.230

along<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.470> line<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.940> negative<00:02:40.510> pressure<00:02:40.750> has

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
along the line the negative pressure has

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.699 
along the line the negative pressure has
reached<00:02:41.410> a<00:02:41.680> value<00:02:42.130> of<00:02:42.280> minus<00:02:42.730> 14<00:02:43.209> psi<00:02:43.870> which<00:02:44.680> is

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
reached a value of minus 14 psi which is

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.680 
reached a value of minus 14 psi which is
cavitation<00:02:45.640> so<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:47.970> cavitation<00:02:48.970> has<00:02:49.270> formed

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
cavitation so the cavitation has formed

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.500 
cavitation so the cavitation has formed
all<00:02:50.290> along<00:02:50.770> the<00:02:50.980> pipe<00:02:51.220> line<00:02:51.489> and<00:02:51.520> in<00:02:51.970> many

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
all along the pipe line and in many

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.360 
all along the pipe line and in many
cases<00:02:52.989> this<00:02:53.140> is<00:02:53.350> unacceptable<00:02:55.920> now<00:02:56.920> I<00:02:56.950> want<00:02:57.310> to

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
cases this is unacceptable now I want to

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.970 
cases this is unacceptable now I want to
look<00:02:57.459> at<00:02:57.610> the<00:02:57.760> same<00:02:58.000> transient<00:02:58.870> problem<00:02:59.350> with

look at the same transient problem with

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.920 
look at the same transient problem with

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
vacuum valves these are valves that

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.600 
vacuum valves these are valves that
admit<00:03:04.930> air<00:03:05.140> into<00:03:05.920> the<00:03:06.070> system<00:03:06.430> when<00:03:06.580> the

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
admit air into the system when the

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.310 
admit air into the system when the
pressure<00:03:06.880> drops<00:03:07.300> and<00:03:07.570> expel<00:03:07.959> it<00:03:08.080> when<00:03:08.200> the

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
air valve which means they have the

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.810 
air valve which means they have the
single<00:03:13.330> orifice<00:03:13.570> for<00:03:14.560> admitting<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.370> air<00:03:15.520> and

single orifice for admitting the air and
expelling<00:03:16.270> the<00:03:16.480> air<00:03:16.510> so<00:03:17.380> let's<00:03:17.620> see<00:03:18.160> what

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
expelling the air so let's see what

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.729 
expelling the air so let's see what
happens<00:03:18.790> when<00:03:18.940> we<00:03:19.000> trip<00:03:19.360> the<00:03:19.510> pump<00:03:19.750> trip<00:03:20.560> the

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
happens when we trip the pump trip the

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.220 
happens when we trip the pump trip the
pump<00:03:21.010> the<00:03:21.190> pressure<00:03:21.430> wave<00:03:21.700> goes<00:03:21.730> down<00:03:22.270> and<00:03:23.049> now

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
pump the pressure wave goes down and now

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.680 
pump the pressure wave goes down and now
I<00:03:23.260> want<00:03:23.530> to<00:03:23.590> stop<00:03:23.830> for<00:03:24.070> a<00:03:24.160> minute<00:03:24.430> you<00:03:25.239> see<00:03:25.480> that

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
I want to stop for a minute you see that

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.710 
I want to stop for a minute you see that
all<00:03:25.930> three<00:03:26.500> air<00:03:27.160> valves<00:03:27.850> have<00:03:28.000> been<00:03:28.150> activated

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
all three air valves have been activated

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.430 
all three air valves have been activated
and<00:03:29.610> there's<00:03:30.610> been<00:03:30.880> no<00:03:31.060> cavitation<00:03:31.900> form<00:03:32.230> in

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
and there's been no cavitation form in

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.150 
and there's been no cavitation form in
the<00:03:32.560> line<00:03:32.799> beyond<00:03:33.730> the<00:03:34.000> original<00:03:34.299> reach<00:03:34.930> so<00:03:35.890> at

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
the line beyond the original reach so at

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.120 
the line beyond the original reach so at
this<00:03:36.340> point<00:03:36.640> the<00:03:36.910> air<00:03:37.030> valves<00:03:37.450> have<00:03:37.570> been

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
this point the air valves have been

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.770 
this point the air valves have been
successful<00:03:39.130> in<00:03:39.190> preventing<00:03:39.700> down<00:03:39.910> surge<00:03:40.209> but

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
successful in preventing down surge but

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.090 
successful in preventing down surge but
I<00:03:40.810> want<00:03:41.019> you<00:03:41.110> to<00:03:41.140> take<00:03:41.320> a<00:03:41.350> look<00:03:41.620> at<00:03:41.709> this<00:03:41.860> when

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
I want you to take a look at this when

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.060 
I want you to take a look at this when
we<00:03:42.250> start<00:03:42.519> up<00:03:42.640> again<00:03:43.080> see<00:03:44.080> a<00:03:44.110> phenomena<00:03:44.709> called

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
we start up again see a phenomena called

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.420 
we start up again see a phenomena called
air<00:03:45.220> slam<00:03:45.670> once<00:03:46.420> this<00:03:47.140> air<00:03:47.470> is<00:03:47.620> expelled<00:03:48.100> if

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
air slam once this air is expelled if

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.039 
air slam once this air is expelled if
the<00:03:48.549> water<00:03:48.790> columns<00:03:49.239> come<00:03:49.510> together<00:03:49.660> too

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
the water columns come together too

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.560 
the water columns come together too
rapidly<00:03:50.530> you<00:03:50.709> get<00:03:50.890> a<00:03:50.920> a<00:03:51.190> large<00:03:51.880> pressure<00:03:52.209> surge

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
rapidly you get a a large pressure surge

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.380 
rapidly you get a a large pressure surge
which<00:03:52.959> can<00:03:53.200> initiate<00:03:53.760> additional<00:03:54.760> transient

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
which can initiate additional transient

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.050 
which can initiate additional transient
problems<00:03:55.840> so<00:03:56.079> let's<00:03:56.320> look<00:03:56.470> at<00:03:56.650> this<00:03:56.860> you<00:03:57.760> see

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
problems so let's look at this you see

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.850 
problems so let's look at this you see
when<00:03:58.299> the<00:03:58.420> airs<00:03:58.630> out<00:03:58.840> you<00:03:59.170> get<00:03:59.320> this<00:03:59.470> pressure

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
when the airs out you get this pressure

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.410 
when the airs out you get this pressure
surge<00:04:00.190> and<00:04:00.489> now<00:04:00.610> you<00:04:00.670> start<00:04:01.090> seeing

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
surge and now you start seeing

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.160 
surge and now you start seeing
cavitation<00:04:02.260> form<00:04:02.640> in<00:04:03.640> intermediate<00:04:04.510> points

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
cavitation form in intermediate points

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.400 
cavitation form in intermediate points
so<00:04:05.799> now<00:04:05.829> the<00:04:06.040> analysis<00:04:06.820> is<00:04:07.000> complete<00:04:07.480> but

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
so now the analysis is complete but

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.590 
so now the analysis is complete but
we've<00:04:08.590> had<00:04:08.890> high<00:04:09.489> pressure<00:04:09.820> spikes<00:04:10.299> and

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
we've had high pressure spikes and

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.319 
we've had high pressure spikes and
cavitation<00:04:11.380> all<00:04:11.709> along<00:04:12.100> the<00:04:12.250> line<00:04:12.489> so<00:04:13.120> these

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:13.329 
cavitation all along the line so these

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:17.370 
cavitation all along the line so these
air<00:04:13.660> valves<00:04:14.170> weren't<00:04:15.690> effective<00:04:16.690> in<00:04:16.900> reducing

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
air valves weren't effective in reducing

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.349 
air valves weren't effective in reducing
the<00:04:17.919> high<00:04:18.100> pressures<00:04:18.579> and<00:04:18.609> the<00:04:18.790> cavitation

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
the high pressures and the cavitation

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.770 
the high pressures and the cavitation
now<00:04:20.049> there<00:04:20.260> are<00:04:20.410> anti<00:04:20.919> slam<00:04:21.340> air<00:04:21.640> valves<00:04:22.180> that

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
now there are anti slam air valves that

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.060 
now there are anti slam air valves that
would<00:04:23.320> be<00:04:23.500> more<00:04:24.040> effective<00:04:24.340> for<00:04:24.790> doing<00:04:25.120> this

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
would be more effective for doing this

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.380 
would be more effective for doing this
okay<00:04:27.070> now<00:04:27.099> we<00:04:27.340> want<00:04:27.640> to<00:04:27.760> look<00:04:27.880> at<00:04:28.000> the<00:04:28.120> same

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
okay now we want to look at the same

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.589 
okay now we want to look at the same
situation<00:04:29.169> with<00:04:29.380> a<00:04:29.440> surge<00:04:29.800> tank<00:04:30.190> in<00:04:30.370> place

00:04:30.589 --> 00:04:30.599 
situation with a surge tank in place

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:32.970 
situation with a surge tank in place
while<00:04:31.599> the<00:04:31.660> air<00:04:31.930> valves<00:04:32.320> provided

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
while the air valves provided

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.830 
while the air valves provided
what<00:04:33.190> I<00:04:33.220> call<00:04:33.490> passive<00:04:34.060> search<00:04:34.270> control

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
what I call passive search control

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.650 
what I call passive search control
because<00:04:35.710> they<00:04:35.920> responded<00:04:36.820> to<00:04:36.850> the<00:04:37.120> down<00:04:37.300> surge

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
because they responded to the down surge

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.560 
because they responded to the down surge
the<00:04:38.410> search<00:04:38.650> tank<00:04:38.980> provides<00:04:39.880> what<00:04:40.270> we<00:04:40.390> call

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
the search tank provides what we call

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.440 
the search tank provides what we call
active<00:04:40.810> surge<00:04:41.260> control<00:04:41.800> because<00:04:42.250> it<00:04:42.490> operates

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
active surge control because it operates

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.190 
active surge control because it operates
in<00:04:44.110> such<00:04:44.320> a<00:04:44.350> way<00:04:44.620> as<00:04:44.800> to<00:04:45.750> eliminate<00:04:46.750> the<00:04:46.930> surge

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
in such a way as to eliminate the surge

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.740 
in such a way as to eliminate the surge
rather<00:04:47.620> than<00:04:47.950> to<00:04:48.130> react<00:04:48.460> to<00:04:48.700> it<00:04:48.880> when<00:04:49.660> the

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
rather than to react to it when the

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.750 
rather than to react to it when the
pressure<00:04:50.020> drops<00:04:50.440> water<00:04:50.920> comes<00:04:51.310> out<00:04:51.490> of<00:04:51.550> the

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
pressure drops water comes out of the

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.210 
pressure drops water comes out of the
surge<00:04:51.970> tank<00:04:52.390> and<00:04:52.630> replaces<00:04:53.560> the<00:04:53.710> water<00:04:53.920> that's

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
surge tank and replaces the water that's

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.120 
surge tank and replaces the water that's
lost<00:04:54.580> due<00:04:55.120> to<00:04:55.150> the<00:04:55.390> pump<00:04:55.630> trip<00:04:55.900> and<00:04:56.140> therefore

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
lost due to the pump trip and therefore

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.610 
lost due to the pump trip and therefore
can<00:04:57.430> reduce<00:04:57.880> the<00:04:58.210> amount<00:04:58.450> of<00:04:58.660> transient

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
can reduce the amount of transient

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.190 
can reduce the amount of transient
pressure<00:04:59.890> that<00:05:00.160> we<00:05:00.340> get<00:05:00.610> so<00:05:01.240> let's<00:05:01.450> play<00:05:01.930> this

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
pressure that we get so let's play this

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:08.130 
pressure that we get so let's play this
and<00:05:02.470> see<00:05:02.620> what<00:05:02.770> happens<00:05:02.830> you<00:05:06.600> can<00:05:07.600> see<00:05:07.960> the

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 
and see what happens you can see the

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.710 
and see what happens you can see the
pressure<00:05:08.920> drops<00:05:09.370> the<00:05:09.700> surge<00:05:10.210> tank<00:05:10.570> is

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
pressure drops the surge tank is

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.630 
pressure drops the surge tank is
providing<00:05:11.260> water<00:05:11.500> is<00:05:11.680> initially<00:05:12.040> half<00:05:12.280> full

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:12.640 
providing water is initially half full

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.750 
providing water is initially half full
and<00:05:13.030> now<00:05:13.510> the<00:05:13.540> water<00:05:13.990> surface<00:05:14.650> oscillates<00:05:15.580> up

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
and now the water surface oscillates up

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.510 
and now the water surface oscillates up
and<00:05:15.940> down<00:05:16.110> we<00:05:17.110> actually<00:05:17.500> run<00:05:17.620> this<00:05:17.800> for<00:05:18.040> a<00:05:18.070> full

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
and down we actually run this for a full

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.540 
and down we actually run this for a full
minute<00:05:18.730> 60-second<00:05:19.690> simulation<00:05:20.350> now<00:05:21.070> the

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
minute 60-second simulation now the

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.280 
minute 60-second simulation now the
interesting<00:05:21.910> thing<00:05:22.420> here<00:05:22.690> is<00:05:22.750> that<00:05:22.930> the

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.290 
interesting thing here is that the

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.530 
interesting thing here is that the
envelope<00:05:23.800> of<00:05:23.980> pressure<00:05:24.280> is<00:05:24.610> contained

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:25.540 
envelope of pressure is contained

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.290 
envelope of pressure is contained
between<00:05:25.840> this<00:05:26.590> upper<00:05:27.070> limit<00:05:27.910> and<00:05:27.940> the<00:05:28.150> lower

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
between this upper limit and the lower

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.290 
between this upper limit and the lower
limit<00:05:28.800> the<00:05:29.800> initial<00:05:30.250> let<00:05:30.550> me<00:05:30.610> go<00:05:30.730> back<00:05:30.970> to<00:05:31.180> the

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
limit the initial let me go back to the

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.450 
limit the initial let me go back to the
initial<00:05:31.540> the<00:05:32.380> initial<00:05:32.410> hydraulic<00:05:33.220> grade<00:05:33.430> line

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
initial the initial hydraulic grade line

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.760 
initial the initial hydraulic grade line
was<00:05:33.850> this<00:05:34.120> so<00:05:34.810> we<00:05:34.900> have<00:05:35.050> very<00:05:35.470> little

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
was this so we have very little

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.880 
was this so we have very little
additional<00:05:36.490> pressure<00:05:36.880> and<00:05:37.620> the<00:05:38.620> pressure

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:38.890 
additional pressure and the pressure

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.460 
additional pressure and the pressure
drop<00:05:39.310> was<00:05:39.670> very<00:05:40.240> much<00:05:40.480> contained<00:05:40.960> so<00:05:41.320> the

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 
drop was very much contained so the

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.070 
drop was very much contained so the
surge<00:05:42.430> tank<00:05:42.790> has<00:05:43.000> been<00:05:43.210> extremely<00:05:43.840> effective

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
surge tank has been extremely effective

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:55.439 
surge tank has been extremely effective
in<00:05:45.210> eliminating<00:05:46.210> the<00:05:47.050> surge<00:05:47.320> problem

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:55.449
