FIRST<00:00:03.870> LEGO<00:00:04.020> Technic<00:00:04.710> boat<00:00:05.100> on<00:00:05.540> this<00:00:06.540> boat<00:00:06.810> is

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
FIRST LEGO Technic boat on this boat is

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.509 
FIRST LEGO Technic boat on this boat is
a<00:00:07.020> catamaran<00:00:07.700> meaning<00:00:08.700> that<00:00:08.880> has<00:00:09.150> three<00:00:10.519> holes

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
a catamaran meaning that has three holes

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.250 
a catamaran meaning that has three holes
on<00:00:12.259> the<00:00:13.259> main<00:00:13.620> hole<00:00:13.889> is<00:00:14.120> from<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.269> small<00:00:15.750> pirate

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
on the main hole is from a small pirate

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.640 
on the main hole is from a small pirate
ship<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:17.060> it<00:00:18.060> has<00:00:18.330> these<00:00:18.570> two<00:00:18.840> ballast<00:00:19.260> tanks

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
ship and it has these two ballast tanks

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.029 
ship and it has these two ballast tanks
which<00:00:19.800> are<00:00:19.980> filled<00:00:20.220> with<00:00:20.750> air<00:00:21.750> so<00:00:22.410> it<00:00:22.439> keeps<00:00:22.859> it

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
which are filled with air so it keeps it

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.450 
which are filled with air so it keeps it
afloat<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.609> it<00:00:23.850> doesn't<00:00:24.240> tip<00:00:24.390> over<00:00:25.250> these<00:00:26.250> are

attached to the frame of the boat and

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:32.600 
attached to the frame of the boat and
there's<00:00:29.519> so<00:00:29.849> support<00:00:30.390> right<00:00:30.539> there<00:00:30.810> um<00:00:31.610> also

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
there's so support right there um also

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.420 
there's so support right there um also
we<00:00:33.570> have<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:34.079> battery<00:00:34.290> box<00:00:34.680> at<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.100> front<00:00:35.130> of

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
we have the battery box at the front of

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.040 
we have the battery box at the front of
the<00:00:35.550> boat<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:36.000> balance<00:00:36.329> out<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.510> weight<00:00:36.719> of

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
the boat to balance out the weight of

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.950 
the boat to balance out the weight of
the<00:00:37.170> motors<00:00:37.500> in<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.800> back<00:00:38.899> there's<00:00:39.899> a

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
the motors in the back there's a

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.810 
the motors in the back there's a
receiver<00:00:40.410> right<00:00:40.710> there<00:00:40.950> which<00:00:41.219> receives<00:00:41.640> the

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
receiver right there which receives the

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.819 
receiver right there which receives the
remote<00:00:42.090> stuff<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.719> inside<00:00:43.559> there<00:00:43.800> there's

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
remote stuff and inside there there's

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.709 
remote stuff and inside there there's
some<00:00:44.250> waterproofing<00:00:46.789> now<00:00:47.789> for<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.480> rear

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
some waterproofing now for the rear

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.750 
some waterproofing now for the rear
motor<00:00:49.020> part<00:00:49.789> first<00:00:50.789> there<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.449> steering

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
motor part first there is the steering

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.630 
motor part first there is the steering
which<00:00:53.760> has<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.440> good<00:00:55.440> pivot<00:00:55.710> point<00:00:56.129> so<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.460> has<00:00:56.610> a

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
which has a good pivot point so it has a

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.209 
which has a good pivot point so it has a
lot<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:58.160> propeller<00:00:59.160> area<00:00:59.940> so<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.809> can<00:01:01.020> go<00:01:01.770> in

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
lot of propeller area so it can go in

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.090 
lot of propeller area so it can go in
all<00:01:02.399> kinds<00:01:02.789> of<00:01:02.850> different<00:01:02.910> directions<00:01:04.100> we

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
all kinds of different directions we

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.420 
all kinds of different directions we
also<00:01:05.250> have<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.820> motor<00:01:06.180> system<00:01:06.930> right<00:01:07.170> there

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
also have the motor system right there

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.179 
also have the motor system right there
which<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.700> an<00:01:08.909> idea<00:01:09.270> using<00:01:09.750> this<00:01:10.080> thing<00:01:10.189> by

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
which is an idea using this thing by

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.499 
which is an idea using this thing by
serial<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.180> his<00:01:12.540> quadra<00:01:13.020> Moran<00:01:14.060> only<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.090> put

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
serial on his quadra Moran only I put

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.960 
serial on his quadra Moran only I put
the<00:01:15.659> motor<00:01:15.840> outboard<00:01:16.619> instead<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.310> onboard

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
the motor outboard instead of onboard

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.969 
the motor outboard instead of onboard
and<00:01:20.299> turns<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.570> big<00:01:21.900> propeller<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.770> back

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
and turns the big propeller in the back

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.630 
and turns the big propeller in the back
right<00:01:23.880> there

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.580 

which<00:01:29.640> pushes<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.510> boat<00:01:30.990> pretty<00:01:31.380> well

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
which pushes the boat pretty well

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.940 
which pushes the boat pretty well
forward<00:01:32.100> or<00:01:32.280> reverse<00:01:32.810> because<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:34.140> has<00:01:34.320> angled

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
forward or reverse because it has angled

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.050 
forward or reverse because it has angled
blades<00:01:35.310> right<00:01:35.700> there<00:01:35.940> and<00:01:37.370> it<00:01:38.370> also<00:01:38.610> works

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
blades right there and it also works

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.830 
blades right there and it also works
really<00:01:39.360> well<00:01:39.480> in<00:01:40.050> going<00:01:40.470> forward<00:01:41.460> reverse

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
really well in going forward reverse

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.870 
really well in going forward reverse
side<00:01:42.840> side<00:01:43.200> um<00:01:44.150> yeah<00:01:45.150> and<00:01:46.130> you<00:01:47.130> can<00:01:47.280> also<00:01:47.490> see

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
side side um yeah and you can also see

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.200 
side side um yeah and you can also see
this<00:01:48.030> boat<00:01:48.360> going<00:01:48.900> in<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.290> water<00:01:49.530> on<00:01:50.090> one<00:01:51.090> of
