00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.750
 but let's get back to this shoulder 2.0 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.000
 we ask the author of the shooting of 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.650
 2005 a hot comment 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.960
 so meanwhile I would like to say something that 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.839
 it's my shoulder was for victory 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:18.630
 therefore anyway more valley remains than viÃ¹ 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:22.920
 is the most prestigious who works 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:25.920
 no oh well i think that first of all 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.939
 I understand Lorenzo well that I understand 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.160
 angry is normal but I think that 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:34.559
 these things happen in motorcycle races 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.390
 they happen in races in general but me 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.360
 I say fortunately they happen in the sense 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.820
 that the last curve if there are then 22 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.590
 champions two strong drivers like like 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.230
 lorenzo and markers that then among other things yes 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.600
 are also playing the leadership of 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.219
 then sampled one those four points 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.730
 more or less can do the 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.789
 difference 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.840
 It is normal for markers to have us 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:01.370
 tried and maybe jorge left me 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.080
 lots of space inside and therefore 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.299
 probably thought it was a bit 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.490
 farther away and then it makes you 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.350
 thrown in and certainly was a 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.350
 overtaking at the limit a bad overtaking 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.990
 but no one has fallen, only there are 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.960
 swap positions I say you can 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.450
 it is a yellow card or nothing 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.650
 I think nothing in the sense if you do a 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.090
 so entered after three laps and could 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.250
 be a yellow card because one 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.500
 stupid thing that serves no purpose though 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.840
 you know it's the last curve e 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:39.030
 there is a place a position to gain 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.820
 according to me there then you can try here is 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.790
 been a bit limited but in my opinion not 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.200
 if the race direction starts at 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.200
 give yellow cards for these things 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.940
 and then a mechanism is triggered that later 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.520
 it becomes difficult because then later 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.070
 what you do you do not wait that is second 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.840
 me the races are more beautiful so Augustin 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.930
 I think Lorenzo during the year 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.150
 have the opportunity to do it again here is a 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.460
 that market point will have to stand on 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.990
 first Augustine rite and study was done 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.570
 all the analysis of the trajectories with the 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.370
 your shoulder and said that yours was a 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.800
 slightly narrower and instead as you say 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.770
 jorge maybe left a little bit yes 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.480
 now the first time I saw it 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.700
 he saved me that there is bernava me mi 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.709
 but I closed the hole a bit 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:27.060
 let's say I invented it a little and 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:29.910
 in the sense the somewhat built ie I have 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.850
 pretended that there was me instead 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.739
 it seems that jorge is probably 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.390
 because he thought that market was a 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.209
 a little farther he made the 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.070
 trajectory a little more normal and there a 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.530
 that marches point has slipped into a 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.890
 last thing all for the week everyone 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.810
 they will talk about this but that 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.730
 effect makes you very careful 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.340
 to the signals also what effect it makes you 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.830
 see this here that valentino of one 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.200
 once again there is also a fact that there 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:03.150
 league has blatantly strange launches though 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.049
 this is the valentine of twenty years are 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.900
 cocks 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.610
 I would say in the sense that I saw 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.709
 that we still run from the next 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.390
 year no longer wins 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.489
 56 years understood so a bit of a problem 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.380
 I hope it is a little less here than 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.769
 Valentine at age 20 or whatever 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.450
 Succeed at least wins race but it is me 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:24.300
 sorry a lot hotter than not 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.830
 having been there because 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.960
 if you were faster anymore 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.400
 competitive and we arrived in three 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.820
 the detached one would have been even more 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.320
 beautiful 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.430
 whoever I don't know is called the shoulder 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.430
 you have to see
