I kind of pulled the Microsoft writing

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:24.139 
I kind of pulled the Microsoft writing
communities<00:01:22.500> your<00:01:22.649> interest<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.789> whether

they were Harley riders or not actually
more<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:27.750> than<00:01:27.929> on<00:01:28.140> Harley<00:01:28.590> riders<00:01:28.950> when<00:01:29.610> they

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
more so than on Harley riders when they

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.609 
more so than on Harley riders when they

god it's awesome it's just awesome the
acceleration<00:01:57.390> is<00:01:57.539> ridiculous<00:01:58.289> all<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:58.619> guys

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
acceleration is ridiculous all you guys

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.660 
acceleration is ridiculous all you guys
are<00:01:58.920> ending<00:01:59.069> today<00:02:00.049> it's<00:02:01.049> ridiculous<00:02:01.950> yes

you'll<00:02:03.360> be<00:02:03.479> able<00:02:03.569> to<00:02:03.689> ride<00:02:03.840> assuming<00:02:04.259> we<00:02:04.380> take

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
you'll be able to ride assuming we take

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:22.100 
you'll be able to ride assuming we take
these<00:02:04.739> back<00:02:05.039> I'm<00:02:05.280> actually<00:02:05.489> thinking<00:02:05.700> about

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:37.650 

right<00:02:22.440> next<00:02:22.740> to<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:22.980> Tesla<00:02:24.410> yeah

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.960 

the<00:02:38.660> regenerative<00:02:39.319> braking<00:02:39.819> actually<00:02:40.819> make

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
the regenerative braking actually make

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.150 
the regenerative braking actually make
it<00:02:41.120> a<00:02:41.239> more<00:02:41.569> controllable<00:02:42.319> motorcycle<00:02:43.010> than

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
it a more controllable motorcycle than

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.460 
it a more controllable motorcycle than
any<00:02:43.450> internal<00:02:44.450> combustion<00:02:44.870> motorcycle<00:02:45.380> and

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
any internal combustion motorcycle and

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.820 
any internal combustion motorcycle and
every<00:02:45.709> bit<00:02:45.890> as<00:02:46.640> the<00:02:46.790> bike<00:02:47.000> itself<00:02:47.739> helps<00:02:48.739> you

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
every bit as the bike itself helps you

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.610 
every bit as the bike itself helps you
gradually<00:02:49.459> slow<00:02:49.819> when<00:02:50.150> you<00:02:50.270> want<00:02:50.480> it<00:02:50.599> and<00:02:50.840> when

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
gradually slow when you want it and when

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.680 
gradually slow when you want it and when
you<00:02:51.709> want<00:02:51.860> to<00:02:52.010> accelerate<00:02:52.370> the<00:02:53.150> throttle<00:02:53.569> is

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
you want to accelerate the throttle is

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.600 
you want to accelerate the throttle is
just<00:02:53.900> instantaneous<00:02:54.590> all<00:02:54.830> the<00:02:54.980> torque<00:02:55.280> all

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
just instantaneous all the torque all

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.120 
just instantaneous all the torque all
the<00:02:55.760> power<00:02:55.970> is<00:02:56.239> just<00:02:56.450> there<00:02:56.780> the<00:02:57.380> minute<00:02:57.890> you

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
the power is just there the minute you

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.850 
the power is just there the minute you
twist<00:02:58.400> your<00:02:58.610> wrist<00:02:59.050> the<00:03:00.050> thing<00:03:00.319> that's<00:03:00.560> really

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
twist your wrist the thing that's really

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.680 
twist your wrist the thing that's really
interesting<00:03:01.010> about<00:03:01.489> livewire<00:03:02.030> is<00:03:02.390> that

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
interesting about livewire is that

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.009 
interesting about livewire is that
