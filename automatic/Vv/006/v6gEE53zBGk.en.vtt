knowledge about preload now what preload

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.010 
knowledge about preload now what preload
is<00:00:14.190> is<00:00:14.400> it's<00:00:14.549> basically<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.450> amount<00:00:15.839> of

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
is is it's basically the amount of

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.400 
is is it's basically the amount of
spring<00:00:16.800> pressure<00:00:17.070> that's<00:00:17.690> holding<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:18.990> each

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
spring pressure that's holding the each

from the factory tain and all these

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.060 
from the factory tain and all these
manufacturers<00:00:24.359> do<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.199> very<00:00:25.529> good<00:00:25.769> job<00:00:26.010> of

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
manufacturers do a very good job of

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.980 
manufacturers do a very good job of
knowing<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.789> curb<00:00:27.060> weight<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.510> car<00:00:27.750> and

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
knowing the curb weight of the car and

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.529 
knowing the curb weight of the car and
knowing<00:00:28.289> what<00:00:28.710> spring<00:00:29.070> pressures<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.609> put<00:00:29.820> on

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
knowing what spring pressures to put on

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.359 
knowing what spring pressures to put on
each<00:00:30.840> corner<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.380> they're<00:00:31.859> adjusted

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
each corner and they're adjusted

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.250 
each corner and they're adjusted
correctly<00:00:32.579> from<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.149> factory<00:00:33.719> so<00:00:34.050> if<00:00:34.170> you

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
correctly from the factory so if you

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.450 
correctly from the factory so if you
just<00:00:34.410> leave<00:00:34.590> those<00:00:34.739> alone<00:00:34.920> you're<00:00:35.219> probably

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
just leave those alone you're probably

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.190 
just leave those alone you're probably
going<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.760> be<00:00:35.850> in<00:00:35.940> good<00:00:36.090> shape<00:00:36.149> however<00:00:36.840> if

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
going to be in good shape however if

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.900 
going to be in good shape however if
you're<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.380> serious<00:00:37.800> track<00:00:38.070> junkie<00:00:38.520> you're

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
you're a serious track junkie you're

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.280 
you're a serious track junkie you're
going<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.090> want<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.300> adjust<00:00:39.420> this<00:00:39.809> by<00:00:40.020> putting

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
going to want to adjust this by putting

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.069 
going to want to adjust this by putting
it<00:00:40.469> on<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.620> set<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.190> four<00:00:41.399> corner<00:00:41.730> scales<00:00:42.079> and

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
it on a set of four corner scales and

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.660 
it on a set of four corner scales and
you<00:00:43.500> probably<00:00:43.890> already<00:00:44.040> have<00:00:44.309> those<00:00:44.520> if

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
you probably already have those if

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.740 
you probably already have those if
you're<00:00:44.760> going<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:44.969> be<00:00:45.059> doing<00:00:45.239> some<00:00:45.480> track<00:00:45.719> time

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
you're going to be doing some track time

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.930 
you're going to be doing some track time
but<00:00:46.469> let's<00:00:46.649> talk<00:00:46.860> about<00:00:47.039> why<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.520> would<00:00:47.760> make

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
but let's talk about why you would make

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.670 
but let's talk about why you would make
the<00:00:48.090> adjustments<00:00:48.600> let's<00:00:48.989> say<00:00:49.140> for<00:00:49.289> example

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
the adjustments let's say for example

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.770 
the adjustments let's say for example
you<00:00:49.770> have<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.280> 500<00:00:50.550> Mustang<00:00:51.059> or<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.270> rear-wheel

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
you have a 500 Mustang or a rear-wheel

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.060 
you have a 500 Mustang or a rear-wheel
drive<00:00:51.809> car<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.500> you're<00:00:52.590> going<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.739> take<00:00:52.949> to

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
drive car that you're going to take to

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.090 
drive car that you're going to take to
the<00:00:53.190> drag<00:00:53.430> strip<00:00:53.780> that<00:00:54.780> engine<00:00:55.410> torques<00:00:55.829> hard

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
the drag strip that engine torques hard

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.220 
the drag strip that engine torques hard
to<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.460> right<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:56.969> what<00:00:57.120> happens<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.809> tries

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
to the right so what happens is it tries

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.959 
to the right so what happens is it tries
to<00:00:58.260> transfer<00:00:58.829> all<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.219> weight<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.520> all<00:00:59.789> that

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
to transfer all that weight and all that

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.819 
to transfer all that weight and all that
power<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.539> one<00:01:00.750> tire<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.410> right<00:01:01.649> rear

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
power to one tire to that right rear

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.709 
power to one tire to that right rear
tire<00:01:01.859> so<00:01:02.640> what<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:02.879> would<00:01:03.000> do<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.690> would

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
tire so what you would do is you would

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.590 
tire so what you would do is you would
add<00:01:03.960> more<00:01:04.320> preload<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.519> right<00:01:05.790> rear<00:01:06.060> what

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
add more preload to the right rear what

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.910 
add more preload to the right rear what
this<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.900> going<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.140> do<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.409> this<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.619> going<00:01:07.860> to

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
this is going to do is this is going to

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.590 
this is going to do is this is going to
force<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.280> car<00:01:08.610> as<00:01:08.790> its<00:01:08.970> trying<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.390> load

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
force the car as its trying to load

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.359 
force the car as its trying to load
everything<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.260> right<00:01:10.439> side<00:01:10.710> it's<00:01:11.189> going

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
everything to the right side it's going

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.160 
everything to the right side it's going
to<00:01:11.430> actually<00:01:11.580> straighten<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.270> car<00:01:12.450> out<00:01:12.630> load

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
to actually straighten the car out load

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.810 
to actually straighten the car out load
the<00:01:13.320> left<00:01:13.560> tire<00:01:13.799> as<00:01:13.920> well<00:01:14.159> you're<00:01:14.610> going<00:01:14.729> to

the left tire as well you're going to

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.760 
the left tire as well you're going to
see<00:01:14.970> increase<00:01:15.450> 60-foot<00:01:16.020> times<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.560> better

going to try to raise the inside left
tire<00:01:38.220> up<00:01:38.490> off<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.880> ground<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.329> what<00:01:39.420> you'll<00:01:39.570> do

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
tire up off the ground so what you'll do

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.080 
tire up off the ground so what you'll do
is<00:01:39.780> you'll<00:01:40.350> add<00:01:40.560> preload<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.520> right-hand

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
is you'll add preload to the right-hand

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.539 
is you'll add preload to the right-hand
side<00:01:42.210> as<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:43.350> go<00:01:43.530> into<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.860> corner<00:01:44.100> it's

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
side as you go into the corner it's

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.160

trying<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.970> dive<00:01:45.180> down<00:01:45.450> if<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.750> have<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:45.930> lot

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
trying to dive down if you have a lot

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.719 
trying to dive down if you have a lot
more<00:01:46.200> spring<00:01:46.649> pressure<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:47.009> lot<00:01:47.130> more<00:01:47.340> preload

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
more spring pressure a lot more preload

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.429 
more spring pressure a lot more preload
in<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:47.970> right<00:01:48.240> front<00:01:48.540> wheel<00:01:48.600> it's<00:01:49.170> actually

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
in that right front wheel it's actually

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.630 
in that right front wheel it's actually
going<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.619> keep<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:49.920> left<00:01:50.159> wheel<00:01:50.399> planted

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
more preload in the right side now if

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.200 
more preload in the right side now if
you're<00:01:58.619> Road<00:01:58.890> course<00:01:59.189> racing<00:01:59.640> what<00:02:00.090> you're

going to do is if you want to increase
your<00:02:29.700> preload<00:02:30.700> you're<00:02:30.850> going<00:02:30.970> to<00:02:31.030> raise<00:02:31.300> that

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
your preload you're going to raise that

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.760 
your preload you're going to raise that
locking<00:02:31.870> collar<00:02:32.020> if<00:02:32.350> you<00:02:32.440> want<00:02:32.590> to<00:02:32.650> decrease

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
locking collar if you want to decrease

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.920 
locking collar if you want to decrease
it<00:02:33.100> you're<00:02:33.190> going<00:02:33.280> to<00:02:33.340> lower<00:02:33.790> it<00:02:33.940> so<00:02:34.480> here's

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930
