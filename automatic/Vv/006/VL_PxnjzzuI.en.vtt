00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.640
 simply

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.900

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.989
 on the computer is then shot down repainted 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:17.459
 you can see that the researcher 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:18.750
 recognizes the album the artist knows and 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.280

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.109
 a firewall authorization made 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.340
 be careful to accept the word 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:39.720
 permission by fire 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.100
 otherwise you may not be able 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.720
 to receive music and that will not hold 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.519
