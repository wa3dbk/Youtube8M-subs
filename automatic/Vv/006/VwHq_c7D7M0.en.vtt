00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
information that's a great question

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.290 
information that's a great question
first<00:00:22.980> of<00:00:23.070> all<00:00:23.220> most<00:00:23.760> of<00:00:23.970> us<00:00:24.060> don't<00:00:24.180> realize

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
first of all most of us don't realize

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.839 
first of all most of us don't realize
that<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.170> only<00:00:25.289> reason<00:00:25.410> we<00:00:25.800> age<00:00:26.039> is<00:00:26.490> because

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
that the only reason we age is because

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.109 
that the only reason we age is because
our<00:00:27.060> genetics<00:00:27.689> cause<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.650> poor<00:00:29.460> control<00:00:29.880> of

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
our genetics cause a poor control of

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.030 
our genetics cause a poor control of
inflammation<00:00:30.539> over<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.590> course<00:00:31.769> of<00:00:31.890> our

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
inflammation over the course of our

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.250 
inflammation over the course of our
livestock<00:00:32.520> lifetimes<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:33.809> causes

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
livestock lifetimes and that causes

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.979 
livestock lifetimes and that causes
cells<00:00:34.620> tissues<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:36.030> organs<00:00:36.270> systems<00:00:36.809> to

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
cells tissues and organs systems to

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.810 
cells tissues and organs systems to
break<00:00:37.200> down<00:00:37.410> which<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:38.190> definition<00:00:38.399> of

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
break down which is the definition of

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.930 
break down which is the definition of
aging<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:39.930> there<00:00:40.860> is<00:00:41.040> no<00:00:41.309> aging<00:00:41.730> without

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
aging so there is no aging without

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.450 
aging so there is no aging without
inflammation<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:42.899> is<00:00:43.379> in<00:00:43.530> then<00:00:44.010> there's<00:00:44.280> no

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
inflammation and is in then there's no

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.080 
inflammation and is in then there's no
inflammation<00:00:45.329> without<00:00:46.170> aging<00:00:50.090> when'd

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
inflammation without aging when'd

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.119 
inflammation without aging when'd
additional<00:00:51.660> supplements<00:00:52.289> are<00:00:52.440> recommended

we want to think about you know where
that<00:01:04.379> inflammation<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.430> if<00:01:05.580> that

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
that inflammation is so if that

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.580 
that inflammation is so if that
