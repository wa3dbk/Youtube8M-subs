00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.440
 the engine is ours now 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.440
 project 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.750
 we have 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.930
 here with a white sheet of paper 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.189
 started constructing the engine 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.000
 is always quite a constructor 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.460
 big thing 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.810
 you start from zero and you have everything 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.660
 Freedoms and you have it 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.970
 especially in the project in formula 1 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.059
 We'll be off the race for two hours 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.879
 maximum here only has 24 hours 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.780
 motors kickern which must always 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.780
 to endure a lot 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.719
 Next level was that we just 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.850
 have considered how should just that 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.570
 individual after unit hans great 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.730
 appearance 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.420
 We then constructed built 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.659
 and then you have different ones 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.670
 tried and tested geometries and so last 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:07.979
 the optimal configuration then 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.960
 determined when the engine exists 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.590
 reassembled in the workshop 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.710
 is 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.690
 on the 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.180
 test bench and fantastic must be 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.700
 slowly before you are never full you drive 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.800
 first in those speed ranges the 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.960
 later relevant for the engine 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.910
 the first striking point is then 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.909
 let's have a complete full load on the piece 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.890
 feels good 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.569
 later very dynamic profile as well as one 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.390
 We learn how to drive continuously 

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:38.939
 track profile after exactly that 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.110
 corresponds with switching operations with 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.420
 limited operation with traction control 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:48.310
 The motorsport then not only through 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.310
 urban is not and vehicle is 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.850
 The next step is then throughout 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.470
 team stood together as we drive up 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.760
 both axles drive the so 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.090
 behind the burn the 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:04.360
 Front axle with action in the machine 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.250
 and, to some extent, the trial depth 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.470
 to achieve the shape of the vehicle as a whole 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.040
 go home on the unicycle test bench 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.040
 present 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.480
 of course, all other components 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:24.700
 not less important, but the engine 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:27.930
 suddenly everything with energy 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.930
 and this heart beats 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.970
 this comes from the board for projects 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.900
 It was very big from the beginning 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.900
 unbroken so 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.920
 if you are so project manager that the 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.920
 People are focused in this dream 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.380
 Of course try the best possible 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.490
 to get out green car as well 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.490
 possible also to advance 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.819
 after the successful rollout today 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.950
 It becomes very clear in the team 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:00.540
 that today's confirmation with the way 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.780
 we all joined together 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.780
 to have
