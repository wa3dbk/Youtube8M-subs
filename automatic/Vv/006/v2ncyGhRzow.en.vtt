them
I<00:00:44.960> have<00:00:45.679> lost<00:00:45.890> a<00:00:46.730> few<00:00:47.420> in<00:00:47.659> my<00:00:47.719> in<00:00:48.559> my<00:00:48.940> practicing

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
I have lost a few in my in my practicing

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.239 
I have lost a few in my in my practicing
but<00:00:51.079> I<00:00:51.109> think<00:00:51.469> I've<00:00:51.589> gotten<00:00:51.769> it<00:00:51.920> down<00:00:52.039> to<00:00:52.100> a

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:52.249 
but I think I've gotten it down to a

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:53.619 
but I think I've gotten it down to a
science<00:00:52.489> and<00:00:52.819> now<00:00:52.909> that<00:00:53.089> I<00:00:53.120> know<00:00:53.210> what<00:00:53.539> I'm

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
science and now that I know what I'm

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:55.419 
science and now that I know what I'm
supposed<00:00:53.870> to<00:00:53.929> do<00:00:54.050> is<00:00:54.199> it's<00:00:54.469> very<00:00:54.559> very<00:00:54.890> easy<00:00:55.249> to

00:00:55.419 --> 00:00:55.429 
supposed to do is it's very very easy to

00:00:55.429 --> 00:01:01.319 
supposed to do is it's very very easy to
keep<00:00:55.579> these<00:00:57.550> supposedly<00:00:58.550> with<00:00:59.479> these<00:00:59.600> guys

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
keep these supposedly with these guys

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:07.320 
keep these supposedly with these guys
you<00:01:02.329> if<00:01:03.109> you<00:01:03.409> I<00:01:04.510> don't<00:01:05.510> know<00:01:05.780> that<00:01:06.380> they're

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
you if you I don't know that they're

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.310 
you if you I don't know that they're
what<00:01:08.330> are<00:01:08.450> the<00:01:08.510> words<00:01:08.690> I'm<00:01:08.870> trying<00:01:08.900> to<00:01:09.110> find

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
what are the words I'm trying to find

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.490 
what are the words I'm trying to find
there<00:01:09.590> if<00:01:10.540> you<00:01:11.540> don't<00:01:11.719> water<00:01:11.899> them<00:01:12.079> for<00:01:12.290> a<00:01:12.320> few

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
there if you don't water them for a few

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.950 
there if you don't water them for a few
years<00:01:12.880> they'll<00:01:13.880> be<00:01:13.939> okay<00:01:14.390> that's<00:01:14.689> kind<00:01:14.930> of

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
years they'll be okay that's kind of

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.039 
years they'll be okay that's kind of
what<00:01:15.110> I'm<00:01:15.200> when<00:01:15.530> I'm<00:01:15.619> getting<00:01:15.950> at<00:01:17.049> these

what I'm when I'm getting at these
plants<00:01:18.409> in<00:01:18.560> particular<00:01:18.649> over<00:01:19.310> the<00:01:19.399> summer

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
plants in particular over the summer

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.270 
plants in particular over the summer
time<00:01:20.229> they're<00:01:21.229> not<00:01:21.259> really<00:01:21.619> growing<00:01:22.159> they're

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
time they're not really growing they're

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.999 
time they're not really growing they're
not<00:01:22.399> doing<00:01:22.640> anything<00:01:22.960> you<00:01:23.960> water<00:01:24.229> them<00:01:24.439> sort

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
not doing anything you water them sort

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:26.499 
not doing anything you water them sort
of<00:01:25.130> like<00:01:25.310> a<00:01:25.340> regular<00:01:25.549> house<00:01:25.850> plant<00:01:26.180> you<00:01:26.329> want

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
of like a regular house plant you want

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.060 
of like a regular house plant you want
to<00:01:26.570> let<00:01:26.689> them<00:01:26.840> dry<00:01:27.020> down<00:01:27.079> between<00:01:27.649> waterings

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
to let them dry down between waterings

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.800 
to let them dry down between waterings
each<00:01:31.070> one<00:01:31.460> of<00:01:31.579> these<00:01:31.700> is<00:01:32.000> actually<00:01:32.810> one<00:01:33.439> leaf

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
each one of these is actually one leaf

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.060 
each one of these is actually one leaf
the<00:01:35.810> camera<00:01:36.140> is<00:01:36.200> not<00:01:36.320> really<00:01:36.590> zooming<00:01:36.950> in

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
the camera is not really zooming in

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.410 
the camera is not really zooming in
they're<00:01:37.219> very<00:01:37.430> good<00:01:37.640> let<00:01:37.909> me<00:01:37.939> see<00:01:38.119> if<00:01:38.210> I<00:01:38.270> can

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
they're very good let me see if I can

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.889 
they're very good let me see if I can
find<00:01:38.630> a<00:01:38.810> bigger<00:01:39.380> one<00:01:39.590> there<00:01:40.240> these<00:01:41.240> here<00:01:41.689> are

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
find a bigger one there these here are

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:43.539 
find a bigger one there these here are
the<00:01:42.200> leaves<00:01:42.500> they're<00:01:42.770> really<00:01:43.070> really<00:01:43.280> thick

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
the leaves they're really really thick

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.139 
the leaves they're really really thick
they<00:01:43.759> really<00:01:44.270> hold<00:01:44.450> the<00:01:44.570> moisture<00:01:46.149> which

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
they really hold the moisture which

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.209 
they really hold the moisture which
tells<00:01:47.450> us<00:01:47.600> that<00:01:47.630> that<00:01:48.049> they<00:01:48.560> really<00:01:49.039> don't

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:49.219 
tells us that that they really don't

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:51.279 
tells us that that they really don't
need<00:01:49.399> a<00:01:49.460> lot<00:01:49.729> of<00:01:50.000> water<00:01:50.329> they<00:01:50.539> hold<00:01:50.810> on<00:01:50.990> to<00:01:51.020> it

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
need a lot of water they hold on to it

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.190 
need a lot of water they hold on to it
and<00:01:51.439> if<00:01:52.429> you<00:01:52.609> water<00:01:52.880> too<00:01:53.179> much<00:01:53.420> these<00:01:54.049> little

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
and if you water too much these little

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.499 
and if you water too much these little
guys<00:01:54.409> don't<00:01:54.740> have<00:01:55.009> a<00:01:55.369> little<00:01:55.880> valve<00:01:56.060> inside

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
guys don't have a little valve inside

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.109 
guys don't have a little valve inside
that<00:01:56.780> tells<00:01:56.990> it<00:01:57.140> I've<00:01:57.799> got<00:01:58.009> too<00:01:58.189> much<00:01:58.340> stop

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
that tells it I've got too much stop

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.209 
that tells it I've got too much stop
taking<00:01:59.479> up<00:01:59.570> the<00:01:59.689> water<00:01:59.899> so<00:02:00.289> what<00:02:00.710> happens<00:02:01.039> if

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219 
taking up the water so what happens if

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:03.039 
taking up the water so what happens if
you<00:02:01.310> water<00:02:01.520> it<00:02:01.640> too<00:02:01.759> much<00:02:01.909> it<00:02:02.539> keeps<00:02:02.810> pulling

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
you water it too much it keeps pulling

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:04.330 
you water it too much it keeps pulling
it<00:02:03.259> in<00:02:03.350> it<00:02:03.469> gets<00:02:03.619> bigger<00:02:03.859> and<00:02:03.950> bigger<00:02:04.189> and

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
it in it gets bigger and bigger and

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.480 
it in it gets bigger and bigger and
bigger<00:02:04.399> and<00:02:04.759> fatter<00:02:05.600> and<00:02:05.899> until<00:02:06.859> it<00:02:07.009> finally

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
bigger and fatter and until it finally

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.990 
bigger and fatter and until it finally
explodes<00:02:08.030> so<00:02:08.780> over<00:02:09.770> watering<00:02:10.100> is<00:02:10.369> the<00:02:10.729> biggest

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
explodes so over watering is the biggest

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.330 
explodes so over watering is the biggest
problem<00:02:12.580> what<00:02:13.580> you<00:02:14.239> will<00:02:14.360> do<00:02:14.680> in<00:02:15.680> about

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
might be different through different

I'll<00:02:39.760> show<00:02:40.060> you<00:02:40.120> in<00:02:40.450> another<00:02:40.659> video<00:02:40.840> another

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
I'll show you in another video another

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.149 
I'll show you in another video another
flower<00:02:41.950> as<00:02:42.190> they<00:02:42.370> happen<00:02:43.680> as<00:02:44.680> you<00:02:44.890> can<00:02:45.010> see

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:45.159 
flower as they happen as you can see

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:47.910 
flower as they happen as you can see
there<00:02:45.370> there's<00:02:45.700> just<00:02:46.680> starting<00:02:47.680> little

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
there there's just starting little

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.130 
there there's just starting little
babies<00:02:48.250> it's<00:02:48.849> splitting<00:02:49.359> apart<00:02:49.420> generally

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
babies it's splitting apart generally

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.539 
babies it's splitting apart generally
this<00:02:50.319> is<00:02:50.500> together<00:02:52.200> so<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.319> little<00:02:53.530> baby<00:02:53.709> will

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
this is together so the little baby will

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.259 
this is together so the little baby will
will<00:02:55.120> come<00:02:55.480> through<00:02:55.659> the<00:02:55.810> center<00:02:55.989> and

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
will come through the center and

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.280 
will come through the center and
eventually<00:02:58.269> it<00:02:58.450> will<00:02:58.599> look<00:02:58.720> like<00:02:58.750> this<00:02:59.079> one

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
eventually it will look like this one

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.240 
eventually it will look like this one
the<00:03:00.220> side<00:03:00.459> leaves<00:03:00.849> will<00:03:01.659> shrivel<00:03:02.470> up<00:03:02.680> that<00:03:02.950> is

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
the side leaves will shrivel up that is

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.649 
the side leaves will shrivel up that is
where<00:03:03.730> they're<00:03:03.940> going<00:03:04.120> to<00:03:04.180> get<00:03:04.299> the<00:03:04.420> moisture

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:04.659 
where they're going to get the moisture

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:06.210 
where they're going to get the moisture
from<00:03:04.930> they're<00:03:05.500> going<00:03:05.620> to<00:03:05.680> get<00:03:05.799> the<00:03:05.889> moisture

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
from they're going to get the moisture

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.180 
from they're going to get the moisture
from<00:03:06.310> these<00:03:06.549> spare<00:03:07.209> leaves<00:03:07.450> here<00:03:07.840> so<00:03:08.680> these

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
from these spare leaves here so these

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.030 
from these spare leaves here so these
will<00:03:09.909> completely<00:03:10.120> dry<00:03:10.720> up<00:03:10.930> to<00:03:11.200> hard<00:03:11.799> little

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
will completely dry up to hard little

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.330 
will completely dry up to hard little
husks<00:03:14.010> and<00:03:15.010> then<00:03:15.519> once<00:03:15.760> once<00:03:16.329> these<00:03:16.599> dry<00:03:16.959> up

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
husks and then once once these dry up

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.390 
husks and then once once these dry up
usually<00:03:18.340> in<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:19.030> late<00:03:20.019> spring<00:03:20.290> that's<00:03:21.250> when

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
usually in the late spring that's when

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.770 
usually in the late spring that's when
you<00:03:21.489> could<00:03:21.609> start<00:03:21.819> watering<00:03:22.030> them<00:03:22.299> again<00:03:22.510> so

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
you could start watering them again so

you could start watering them again so
don't<00:03:22.989> don't<00:03:23.290> water<00:03:23.590> them<00:03:23.799> a<00:03:23.949> drop<00:03:24.400> until

to<00:04:22.570> always<00:04:22.659> turn<00:04:22.960> into<00:04:23.110> a<00:04:23.229> mush<00:04:23.500> ball<00:04:23.770> so<00:04:24.310> that

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
to always turn into a mush ball so that

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.060 
to always turn into a mush ball so that
that<00:04:24.909> really<00:04:25.150> explains<00:04:25.419> it<00:04:25.750> this<00:04:26.440> one<00:04:26.650> here

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
that really explains it this one here

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.830 
that really explains it this one here
it's<00:04:27.610> in<00:04:27.789> the<00:04:27.880> same<00:04:28.060> family<00:04:28.300> they<00:04:28.570> call<00:04:28.750> this

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
it's in the same family they call this

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.589 
it's in the same family they call this
one<00:04:29.020> a<00:04:29.050> split<00:04:29.409> rock

00:04:30.589 --> 00:04:30.599 
one a split rock

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:32.719 
one a split rock
it's<00:04:30.990> a<00:04:31.110> slightly<00:04:31.440> bigger<00:04:31.770> variety<00:04:32.039> I<00:04:32.460> don't

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
it's a slightly bigger variety I don't

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:34.070 
it's a slightly bigger variety I don't
know<00:04:32.789> if<00:04:32.910> you<00:04:32.970> can<00:04:33.060> see<00:04:33.240> between<00:04:33.569> there<00:04:33.810> these

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
know if you can see between there these

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.710 
know if you can see between there these
are<00:04:34.139> the<00:04:34.289> new<00:04:34.530> leaves<00:04:35.030> the<00:04:36.030> old<00:04:36.240> ones<00:04:36.539> are

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
are the new leaves the old ones are

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.770 
are the new leaves the old ones are
almost<00:04:37.110> dried<00:04:37.620> up<00:04:37.830> so<00:04:38.280> I<00:04:38.310> can<00:04:38.729> almost<00:04:38.970> start

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
almost dried up so I can almost start

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.779 
almost dried up so I can almost start
watering<00:04:40.229> this<00:04:40.349> one<00:04:43.400> this<00:04:44.400> one<00:04:44.639> would<00:04:44.759> be

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789 
watering this one this one would be

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:47.089 
watering this one this one would be
easier<00:04:45.180> to<00:04:45.240> see<00:04:45.509> the<00:04:45.690> new<00:04:45.840> leaves<00:04:46.110> as<00:04:46.860> they

00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:47.099 
easier to see the new leaves as they

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:50.240 
easier to see the new leaves as they
start<00:04:47.430> because<00:04:48.289> it's<00:04:49.289> it's<00:04:49.590> completely<00:04:50.130> open

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
start because it's it's completely open

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.610 
start because it's it's completely open
between<00:04:50.580> them<00:04:50.940> it's<00:04:51.720> a<00:04:51.930> pretty<00:04:52.380> fascinating

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
between them it's a pretty fascinating

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.430 
between them it's a pretty fascinating
plant<00:04:53.160> so<00:04:53.940> if<00:04:54.660> you're<00:04:54.870> one<00:04:55.020> of<00:04:55.110> those<00:04:55.199> people

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
plant so if you're one of those people

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.409 
plant so if you're one of those people
that<00:04:55.620> has<00:04:55.919> a<00:04:55.949> nice<00:04:56.190> a<00:04:56.400> nice<00:04:56.669> really<00:04:57.240> really

00:05:09.649 --> 00:05:09.659 
a lot of fun they don't do a lot they

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:11.570 
a lot of fun they don't do a lot they
don't<00:05:09.810> grow<00:05:10.139> like<00:05:10.169> crazy<00:05:10.440> they<00:05:10.949> don't<00:05:11.130> get<00:05:11.340> ten

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580

don't grow like crazy they don't get ten
feet<00:05:11.789> tall<00:05:12.060> they<00:05:13.020> just<00:05:13.259> stay<00:05:13.470> very<00:05:13.860> very<00:05:14.099> small

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
feet tall they just stay very very small

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.399 
feet tall they just stay very very small
every<00:05:15.270> year<00:05:15.509> you'll<00:05:15.659> get<00:05:15.780> a<00:05:15.840> new<00:05:16.139> set<00:05:16.380> of

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:16.409 
every year you'll get a new set of

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:19.159 
every year you'll get a new set of
leaves<00:05:16.680> and<00:05:16.889> the<00:05:16.979> old<00:05:17.190> leaves<00:05:17.520> will<00:05:17.819> will<00:05:18.419> will

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
leaves and the old leaves will will will

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:21.200 
leaves and the old leaves will will will
shrivel<00:05:19.380> up<00:05:19.560> so<00:05:20.310> it<00:05:20.430> kind<00:05:20.639> of<00:05:20.669> just<00:05:20.880> stays<00:05:20.940> the

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
shrivel up so it kind of just stays the

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.899 
shrivel up so it kind of just stays the
same<00:05:21.240> but<00:05:21.930> I<00:05:21.960> the<00:05:22.860> fun<00:05:23.069> thing<00:05:23.280> about<00:05:23.310> these<00:05:23.729> is

00:05:23.899 --> 00:05:23.909 
same but I the fun thing about these is

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:25.550 
same but I the fun thing about these is
you<00:05:23.940> can<00:05:24.060> turn<00:05:24.360> them<00:05:24.569> into<00:05:24.690> a<00:05:24.780> little<00:05:24.960> living

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
you can turn them into a little living

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.820 
you can turn them into a little living
rock<00:05:25.830> garden<00:05:26.280> I<00:05:27.240> will<00:05:27.539> make<00:05:27.900> a<00:05:27.930> video<00:05:28.110> in<00:05:28.530> time

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
rock garden I will make a video in time

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.770 
rock garden I will make a video in time
these<00:05:29.159> ones<00:05:29.370> are<00:05:29.490> relatively<00:05:30.150> new<00:05:30.330> and<00:05:30.659> I've

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
these ones are relatively new and I've

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.620 
these ones are relatively new and I've
been<00:05:31.259> getting<00:05:31.470> used<00:05:31.620> to<00:05:31.759> the<00:05:32.759> growing<00:05:33.090> process

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
been getting used to the growing process

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.480 
been getting used to the growing process
but<00:05:34.259> since<00:05:34.469> I've<00:05:34.620> mastered<00:05:35.130> the<00:05:35.219> growing

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
but since I've mastered the growing

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.550 
but since I've mastered the growing
process<00:05:35.909> I<00:05:36.030> think<00:05:36.090> I<00:05:36.449> think<00:05:36.990> I'd<00:05:37.080> like<00:05:37.259> to<00:05:37.409> take

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
process I think I think I'd like to take

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.430 
process I think I think I'd like to take
a<00:05:37.620> larger<00:05:38.430> sized<00:05:38.639> pot<00:05:39.530> shallow<00:05:40.530> a<00:05:40.860> shallow<00:05:41.370> pot

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
a larger sized pot shallow a shallow pot

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.510 
a larger sized pot shallow a shallow pot
and<00:05:43.440> I'm<00:05:43.560> going<00:05:43.680> to<00:05:43.710> have<00:05:43.889> an<00:05:44.009> individually

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
and I'm going to have an individually

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.800 
and I'm going to have an individually
product<00:05:44.909> because<00:05:45.150> they<00:05:45.240> all<00:05:45.360> seem<00:05:45.570> to<00:05:45.659> do

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
product because they all seem to do

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.529 
product because they all seem to do
their<00:05:45.960> own<00:05:45.990> thing<00:05:46.110> in<00:05:46.500> their<00:05:46.590> own<00:05:46.620> time<00:05:47.009> so

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:47.539 
their own thing in their own time so

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:50.749 
their own thing in their own time so
when<00:05:48.539> one<00:05:48.750> needs<00:05:48.960> watering<00:05:49.520> another<00:05:50.520> might

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:50.759 
when one needs watering another might

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:52.640 
when one needs watering another might
not<00:05:51.000> so<00:05:51.360> if<00:05:51.630> you<00:05:51.840> have<00:05:51.960> them<00:05:52.110> individually

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
not so if you have them individually

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.740 
not so if you have them individually
potted<00:05:53.340> plunged<00:05:53.940> into<00:05:54.180> a<00:05:54.690> little<00:05:55.349> landscape

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:56.750 
potted plunged into a little landscape

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.930 
potted plunged into a little landscape
they<00:05:57.750> can<00:05:57.930> really<00:05:58.340> really<00:05:59.340> make<00:05:59.610> a<00:05:59.669> neat

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
they can really really make a neat

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.659 
they can really really make a neat
effect<00:06:00.060> so<00:06:00.990> when<00:06:01.259> I<00:06:01.289> when<00:06:01.620> I<00:06:01.650> make<00:06:01.889> that<00:06:02.130> pot<00:06:02.460> up

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:02.669 
effect so when I when I make that pot up

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:05.240 
effect so when I when I make that pot up

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:07.889 
what the roots look like how they grow
