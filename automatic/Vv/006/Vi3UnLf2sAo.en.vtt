00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
or

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.500 
or
do<00:02:09.740> something<00:02:10.220> because<00:02:10.520> if<00:02:10.790> it's<00:02:11.000> not<00:02:11.060> for<00:02:11.360> me

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
do something because if it's not for me

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.410 
do something because if it's not for me
sometimes<00:02:12.080> I<00:02:12.230> feel<00:02:12.440> like<00:02:12.880> no<00:02:13.880> they<00:02:14.060> won't<00:02:14.270> do

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
sometimes I feel like no they won't do

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.420 
sometimes I feel like no they won't do
anything<00:02:14.840> and<00:02:15.020> I<00:02:15.320> regret<00:02:15.830> the<00:02:16.010> fact<00:02:16.040> that<00:02:16.340> I

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
anything and I regret the fact that I

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.630 
anything and I regret the fact that I
can't<00:02:16.730> be<00:02:16.940> an<00:02:17.150> AI<00:02:17.600> in<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.470> player<00:02:18.740> career<00:02:19.430> mode

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
can't be an AI in the player career mode

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.880 
can't be an AI in the player career mode
because<00:02:19.880> if<00:02:20.060> I<00:02:20.240> could<00:02:20.300> have<00:02:20.660> played<00:02:20.960> for<00:02:21.290> all<00:02:21.560> a

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
because if I could have played for all a

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.380 
because if I could have played for all a
eyes<00:02:22.070> I<00:02:22.340> think<00:02:22.550> I<00:02:22.640> would<00:02:22.790> have<00:02:22.850> enjoyed<00:02:22.940> that

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
eyes I think I would have enjoyed that

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.530 
eyes I think I would have enjoyed that
better<00:02:23.660> all<00:02:24.500> right<00:02:24.590> well<00:02:24.800> I<00:02:24.830> could<00:02:25.190> but<00:02:25.540> like

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
better all right well I could but like

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.070 
better all right well I could but like
we<00:02:26.690> saw<00:02:26.900> in<00:02:27.200> part<00:02:27.590> one<00:02:27.890> if<00:02:28.160> I<00:02:28.790> was<00:02:29.120> to<00:02:29.480> play<00:02:29.780> as

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
we saw in part one if I was to play as

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.590 
we saw in part one if I was to play as
the<00:02:30.440> AI<00:02:30.590> is<00:02:30.830> I<00:02:31.040> wouldn't<00:02:31.340> buy<00:02:31.580> a<00:02:31.610> ID<00:02:31.940> I<00:02:32.180> wouldn't

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
the AI is I wouldn't buy a ID I wouldn't

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.560 
the AI is I wouldn't buy a ID I wouldn't
get<00:02:32.780> all<00:02:33.140> the<00:02:33.950> trophies<00:02:34.700> for<00:02:35.180> my<00:02:35.330> player

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
get all the trophies for my player

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.290 
get all the trophies for my player
career<00:02:36.020> but<00:02:36.650> I<00:02:36.950> guess<00:02:37.220> that<00:02:37.730> will<00:02:37.910> help<00:02:38.090> me

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
career but I guess that will help me

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.680 
career but I guess that will help me
prove<00:02:38.600> my<00:02:39.320> dominance<00:02:39.980> as<00:02:40.220> a<00:02:40.670> single<00:02:41.180> player<00:02:41.330> in

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
prove my dominance as a single player in

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.920 
prove my dominance as a single player in
my<00:02:42.350> team<00:02:42.380> and<00:02:42.950> just<00:02:43.460> stand<00:02:44.030> out<00:02:44.210> as<00:02:44.420> a<00:02:44.480> player

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
my team and just stand out as a player

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.810 
my team and just stand out as a player
now<00:02:45.500> I<00:02:45.530> wonder<00:02:45.920> how<00:02:46.040> are<00:02:46.100> they<00:02:46.250> going<00:02:46.460> what

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
FIFA 13 do you think it's more of the

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.290 
FIFA 13 do you think it's more of the
same<00:03:21.530> every<00:03:21.830> year<00:03:22.100> do<00:03:22.310> you<00:03:22.400> think<00:03:22.490> that<00:03:22.850> you're

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
same every year do you think that you're

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.120 
same every year do you think that you're
licking<00:03:23.510> them<00:03:23.750> every<00:03:24.320> new<00:03:24.500> game<00:03:24.770> that<00:03:24.800> comes

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
licking them every new game that comes

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.820 
licking them every new game that comes
out<00:03:25.400> but<00:03:26.150> anyways<00:03:26.540> I<00:03:26.750> think<00:03:26.870> that<00:03:27.320> this<00:03:27.560> match

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
out but anyways I think that this match

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.820 
out but anyways I think that this match
I've<00:03:28.160> been<00:03:28.280> struggling<00:03:28.550> so<00:03:29.120> much<00:03:29.260> like<00:03:30.260> I<00:03:30.470> have

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
I've been struggling so much like I have

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.740 
I've been struggling so much like I have
the<00:03:31.070> worst<00:03:31.280> teammates<00:03:31.820> I<00:03:32.060> don't<00:03:32.420> think<00:03:32.600> to

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
the worst teammates I don't think to

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.740 
the worst teammates I don't think to
them<00:03:32.930> or<00:03:33.110> fix<00:03:33.320> me<00:03:33.590> but<00:03:34.220> one<00:03:35.000> goal<00:03:35.240> and<00:03:35.510> the

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
them or fix me but one goal and the

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.320 
them or fix me but one goal and the
match<00:03:35.930> is<00:03:36.110> still<00:03:36.440> there's<00:03:36.950> almost<00:03:37.160> over<00:03:37.700> but

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
match is still there's almost over but

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.650 
match is still there's almost over but
yeah<00:03:38.930> I<00:03:38.959> guess<00:03:39.290> it<00:03:39.950> happens<00:03:40.340> you<00:03:40.580> know<00:03:40.700> and<00:03:40.970> it

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
yeah I guess it happens you know and it

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.630 
yeah I guess it happens you know and it
seems<00:03:41.930> as<00:03:42.110> though<00:03:42.260> that<00:03:42.500> we<00:03:42.650> had<00:03:42.860> more

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
seems as though that we had more

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.960 
seems as though that we had more
penalties<00:03:44.270> than<00:03:45.140> goals<00:03:45.770> itself<00:03:46.280> and<00:03:46.550> that

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
penalties than goals itself and that

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.630 
penalties than goals itself and that
sometimes<00:03:47.600> really<00:03:47.860> really<00:03:48.860> hit<00:03:49.040> annoying<00:03:49.430> and

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
sometimes really really hit annoying and

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.240 
sometimes really really hit annoying and
I<00:03:50.150> have<00:03:50.270> gotten<00:03:50.570> I've<00:03:51.140> been<00:03:51.380> kind<00:03:51.770> of<00:03:51.860> rough<00:03:52.100> in

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
I have gotten I've been kind of rough in

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.890 
I have gotten I've been kind of rough in
this<00:03:52.430> match<00:03:52.640> as<00:03:52.820> well<00:03:53.000> I've<00:03:53.270> been<00:03:53.420> tackling

this match as well I've been tackling
people<00:03:54.080> and<00:03:54.860> I<00:03:54.920> guess<00:03:55.070> it's<00:03:55.250> the<00:03:55.310> frustration

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
people and I guess it's the frustration

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.790 
people and I guess it's the frustration
building<00:03:56.330> that<00:03:56.540> I<00:03:56.570> can't<00:03:56.870> get<00:03:57.050> any<00:03:57.530> decent

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800

on
the<00:04:36.770> goalie<00:04:37.010> was<00:04:37.250> thirsty<00:04:37.550> and<00:04:37.880> Wow<00:04:38.540> and

offside

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
offside

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.670 
offside
I<00:04:40.300> realized<00:04:41.300> before<00:04:41.660> I<00:04:41.690> never<00:04:41.780> actually<00:04:42.320> knew

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
I realized before I never actually knew

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.740 
I realized before I never actually knew
what<00:04:42.800> an<00:04:42.890> offside<00:04:43.250> was<00:04:43.490> until<00:04:43.940> a<00:04:44.120> few<00:04:44.720> years

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
what an offside was until a few years

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.990 
what an offside was until a few years
ago<00:04:45.080> and<00:04:45.530> yeah<00:04:46.070> I<00:04:46.100> can<00:04:46.370> get<00:04:46.520> a<00:04:46.550> little<00:04:46.850> bit

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
ago and yeah I can get a little bit

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.820 
ago and yeah I can get a little bit
annoying<00:04:47.240> in<00:04:47.450> sports<00:04:47.690> games<00:04:47.960> but<00:04:48.320> you<00:04:48.650> just

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
annoying in sports games but you just

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.980 
annoying in sports games but you just
need<00:04:48.980> to<00:04:49.100> find<00:04:49.310> out<00:04:49.520> how<00:04:49.700> not<00:04:50.030> to<00:04:50.330> shoot

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
need to find out how not to shoot

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.170 
need to find out how not to shoot
exactly<00:04:51.530> at<00:04:51.710> your<00:04:51.890> player<00:04:52.130> to<00:04:52.790> make<00:04:52.940> it<00:04:53.060> an

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
exactly at your player to make it an

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.360 
exactly at your player to make it an
offside<00:04:53.570> and<00:04:53.600> I<00:04:54.110> guess<00:04:54.290> it<00:04:54.650> doesn't<00:04:55.040> really

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
offside and I guess it doesn't really

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.900 
offside and I guess it doesn't really
happen<00:04:55.610> that<00:04:55.790> often<00:04:56.360> and<00:04:57.160> yeah<00:04:58.160> I<00:04:58.430> like<00:04:58.760> it

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910
