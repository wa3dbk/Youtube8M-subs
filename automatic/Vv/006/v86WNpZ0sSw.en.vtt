00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.570
 Hi everyone of the world rubber market 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.520
 This is a table tennis wisdom bag 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.480
 Nice to meet you A little bit of atmosphere today 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.909
 It is different today 

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:16.190
 Why Sticking Rubber to Plastic Balls 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.480
 I would like to talk about what is good 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.340
 I think this is a driveman 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.521
 It will be the target video Now on plastic balls 

00:00:24.521 --> 00:00:28.480
 Those who are troubled with choosing a tool while the ball is changing 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.880
 I think so many this time this time 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.800
 It is a plastic ball with an adhesive tension rubber 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.690
 When it comes to plastic, it is more shiny 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.030
 I understand, so today I will give you three stories 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.510
 I think I'm going to be the first one It is this 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.620
 Plastic balls are more than ever 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.660
 A good ball-keeping rubber has become suitable 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.309
 After all everyone 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.199
 It becomes a plastic ball and the power of the ball does not come out 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.309
 The trouble that the slowed rotation can not be caught 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.000
 I think many people have 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.370
 What rubber do you use for celluloid 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.060
 The rubber that you used in the celluloid ball now 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.521
 It is a rubber with the ball holding ball holding what kind of ball holding 

00:01:16.521 --> 00:01:19.150
 I do not know if there is everyone's rubber 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.910
 I think there is a condition of the ball In the presence of the ball 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.880
 Plastic will be plastic 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.790
 Spherical separation is faster than celluloid 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.260
 Everyone is using it now 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.690
 We need to make the ball more powerful than rubber 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.840
 I don't wanna rubber this plastic 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.430
 Easy-to-play ball rotation 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.240
 I have to regain my possession by this rubber 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.210
 It's not good and I can say it easily 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.750
 Spin system tension rubber with celluloid 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.360
 If you were using plastic 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.420
 Adhesive tension rubber is appropriate 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.830
 If you are using celluloid spin rubber now 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.670
 Keep the same spin system in that image 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.280
 If you hit a plastic ball is fast off the rotation can not take place 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.420
 There were a lot of people who had troubles such as playing 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.420
 So I have a spin system tension rubber there 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.660
 People who used until now are by plastic 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.410
 Adhesive tension rubber is very close 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.110
 I think there is an adhesive tension rubber so I think 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.160
 Why are you all better than ever? 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.620
 It is said that plastic with good ball holding is necessary in plastic 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.390
 It is because it turned out that high speed and rotation 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.170
 I can maintain my balance 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.000
 The nature of the ball is fast off the ball 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.670
 Because it has changed, so much rubber 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.560
 Choose a ball with better than ever 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.569
 What the ball grabs the ball 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.310
 It is feeling like choosing It is the second this time 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.610
 Second is the adhesive tension rubber this time 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.360
 Sticking feel is a good reason for plastic 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.870
 If the feeling of being sticky is plastic 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.330
 It is said that it will be halved by half 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.959
 Sticky rubber is a shot feeling is peter petcha 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.550
 I feel like everyone is really stuck 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.211
 Many people were not good at this plastic 

00:03:09.211 --> 00:03:13.030
 The feeling that this little pops off moderately after having become 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.860
 Thanks to being born in the ball, it has a sticky feel 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.170
 I can not feel that much so everyone is fine 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.970
 Tension rubber using spin system rubber 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.800
 One that is used is adhesive tension 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.480
 I hit it with plastic and use it as it is 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.970
 It's not so sticky that I say 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.130
 Those who like the feel of the ball pretty clear 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.400
 There were many, so there was no peculiarity 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.110
 Spin system already because it is easy to handle 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.651
 In the feeling that it is easy to do from the tension rubber 

00:03:39.651 --> 00:03:41.230
 It has become too sticky 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.310
 If tension rubber is compatible with plastic 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.300
 It is the reason I said and it's the third one 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.400
 The third reason why the adhesive tension rubber 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.239
 If it is good for plastic balls 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.970
 The third is the type of drive that bites into 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.970
 It turned out that the rotation was particularly strong 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.670
 In fact, plastic balls are fast and loose balls 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.760
 As it feels heavy ball, it seems to rub thinly on the surface 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.530
 When it is made to bite more than a sense and strike 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.519
 It turns out that it takes a turn 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.370
 In short, because the ball is fast off the plastic 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.970
 In the case of hitting a ball that you try to put thinly on the surface 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.280
 I'm weak at the rotation so I will be apart 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.360
 If it is made to bite further, the plastic weight plastic ball will 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.669
 It's easy to hit it because it will break in. 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:35.910
 It is the school that makes it rub and the school that makes it bite 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.300
 It was a drive but 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.810
 Plastic balls are suitable for cutting into 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.570
 I feel like I'm going to change to that side 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.770
 The fact is that it is a hard sticky rubber The conventional hard sticky rubber is 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.770
 It feels like it feels like you try to hang it on the surface 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.699
 Actually this plastic is on the surface 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:02.479
 It is hard to put the sheet with hard adhesive rubber. 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:05.910
 If it is done with the surface if it is a hard rubber which says that sponge is also hard 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.520
 I'm getting away with this goodness of plastic 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.400
 I will hesitate by the hardness of the sheet 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.729
 So it's my sense but with a hard rubber 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:19.520
 Hard stickiness is my favorite 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.979
 I was hanging around with a loop drive 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:24.410
 If you do it like that, hit thinly and leave immediately 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.180
 The trouble is that the loop does not hang at all 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.802
 I'm out so I can't get a loop 

00:05:29.802 --> 00:05:32.400
 I'm in trouble but I would rather say 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.840
 Adhesive rubber is a type of people who feel like rubbing 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.770
 I think a little difficult 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.139
 So the good properties of plastic balls 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:44.470
 With this plastic weight that is easy to bite 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:45.870
 If you are conscious of going into it already 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.020
 I will enter with this weight very much 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.970
 So it became easier to bite 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:54.590
 If you think of a sticky rubber, don't worry 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.710
 We specialized in making the adhesive tension rubber bite 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.400
 I think you all know you say rubber 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.320
 While biting in sheet and sponge 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.760
 It is the adhesive tension rubber that can be drawn this high 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.030
 It is a specialty field, but it is already 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.260
 If it is a plastic ball, this adhesive tension rubber 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.710
 It is harder to bite and put on a sticky rubber 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.030
 It hangs more than rubbing on the surface 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:22.759
 This was a big surprise for the plastic ball 

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:25.330
 Because it is performance plastic ball 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.889
 If you use the characteristics quite well 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:31.320
 Adhesive tension rubber is easy to follow from adhesive rubber 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.080
 And from the spin system tension rubber 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.530
 A very versatile rubber that is easy to follow 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.850
 It turned out that I was driving man 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.350
 Those who aim to achieve both rotation and speed firmly 

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:44.690
 It gathers quite in the adhesion tension rubber 

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.889
 I think I am honest 

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:50.721
 I will put together and it is a plastic ball 

00:06:50.721 --> 00:06:54.020
 The strength of the rotation you want now 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.210
 And the growth of balls and plastic balls 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.020
 All I want is a ball and a plastic ball 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.580
 All you need is the tension rubber that is quite sticky 

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.400
 I already have it rather than a strong personality 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.440
 In the sense of high totality 

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.729
 It feels like it has all 

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:14.750
 Plastic balls will come off the ball faster 

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.660
 This is an unavoidable characteristic 

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.770
 So with the same speed and stove roll as previous celluloids 

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.990
 When you become aware of the rotation 

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:27.340
 I have to make the ball stronger 

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:30.580
 I can not hit it in the same sense 

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:33.380
 Thank you very much if you become positive
