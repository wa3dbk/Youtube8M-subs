00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
now when I made this list of goals like

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.740 
now when I made this list of goals like
I<00:01:10.190> said<00:01:10.400> it<00:01:10.490> was<00:01:10.610> a<00:01:10.640> few<00:01:10.970> weeks<00:01:11.120> after<00:01:11.450> i<00:01:11.630> joined

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
I said it was a few weeks after i joined

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.200 
I said it was a few weeks after i joined
obey<00:01:12.350> and<00:01:12.590> back<00:01:12.800> then<00:01:13.070> I<00:01:13.100> was<00:01:13.460> really<00:01:13.820> really

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
obey and back then I was really really

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.090 
obey and back then I was really really
small<00:01:14.660> I<00:01:14.900> did<00:01:15.050> not<00:01:15.230> think<00:01:15.260> that<00:01:15.530> I<00:01:15.650> was<00:01:15.800> going

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
small I did not think that I was going

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.890 
small I did not think that I was going
to<00:01:16.220> hit<00:01:16.370> any<00:01:16.610> of<00:01:16.730> these<00:01:16.940> goals<00:01:17.240> and<00:01:17.480> back<00:01:17.660> then

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
to hit any of these goals and back then

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.930 
to hit any of these goals and back then
all<00:01:18.080> those<00:01:18.320> goals<00:01:18.620> seemed<00:01:18.950> very<00:01:19.160> unrealistic

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
all those goals seemed very unrealistic

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.520 
all those goals seemed very unrealistic
to<00:01:20.240> me<00:01:20.360> I<00:01:20.390> didn't<00:01:20.780> think<00:01:20.900> that<00:01:21.080> I<00:01:21.110> was<00:01:21.230> going<00:01:21.440> to

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
to me I didn't think that I was going to

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.230 
to me I didn't think that I was going to
actually<00:01:21.770> hit<00:01:22.100> any<00:01:22.340> of<00:01:22.490> the<00:01:22.610> goals<00:01:22.940> it<00:01:23.150> was

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
actually hit any of the goals it was

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.910 
actually hit any of the goals it was
something<00:01:23.600> that<00:01:23.630> I<00:01:23.780> could<00:01:23.870> work<00:01:24.290> toward<00:01:24.710> and

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
something that I could work toward and

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.590 
something that I could work toward and
now<00:01:25.070> it's<00:01:25.340> not<00:01:25.430> even<00:01:25.520> two<00:01:25.970> months<00:01:26.150> until<00:01:26.420> the

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
now it's not even two months until the

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.150 
now it's not even two months until the
