00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
that was pretty well written but that

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.400

after going through Kanto in its

that<00:03:26.629> were<00:03:26.750> absent<00:03:27.110> from<00:03:27.260> silver<00:03:27.739> I<00:03:27.920> was

that were absent from silver I was

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.770 
that were absent from silver I was
really<00:03:28.489> interested<00:03:28.700> in<00:03:29.030> seeing<00:03:29.330> if<00:03:29.420> the<00:03:29.540> Elite

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
really interested in seeing if the Elite

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.750 
really interested in seeing if the Elite
Four<00:03:29.810> was<00:03:30.290> any<00:03:30.470> different<00:03:30.860> as<00:03:30.950> well<00:03:31.190> upon

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
Four was any different as well upon

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.759 
Four was any different as well upon
entering<00:03:32.150> the<00:03:32.390> indigo<00:03:32.750> league<00:03:32.989> I<00:03:33.200> encountered

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
entering the indigo league I encountered

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.770 
entering the indigo league I encountered
Lorelei<00:03:34.310> and<00:03:34.580> it<00:03:34.760> felt<00:03:34.970> as<00:03:35.120> if<00:03:35.239> I<00:03:35.390> was<00:03:35.540> facing

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
Lorelei and it felt as if I was facing

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.270 
Lorelei and it felt as if I was facing
the<00:03:35.959> Elite<00:03:36.260> Four<00:03:36.500> for<00:03:36.709> the<00:03:36.739> very<00:03:36.950> first<00:03:37.129> time

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
the Elite Four for the very first time

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.400 
the Elite Four for the very first time
again<00:03:37.790> I<00:03:38.000> think<00:03:38.150> it<00:03:38.450> was<00:03:38.569> the<00:03:38.690> combination<00:03:39.019> of

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
again I think it was the combination of

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.140 
again I think it was the combination of
the<00:03:39.530> bare-bones<00:03:39.739> room<00:03:40.220> in<00:03:40.370> the<00:03:40.459> Kanto<00:03:40.819> gym

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
the bare-bones room in the Kanto gym

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.699 
the bare-bones room in the Kanto gym
theme<00:03:41.360> that<00:03:41.510> probably<00:03:41.900> gave<00:03:42.110> me<00:03:42.140> that<00:03:42.410> image

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
theme that probably gave me that image

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.140 
theme that probably gave me that image
and<00:03:42.920> though<00:03:43.129> I<00:03:43.160> came<00:03:43.400> prepared

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
and though I came prepared

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.970 
and though I came prepared
I<00:03:44.180> didn't<00:03:44.540> feel<00:03:44.690> ready<00:03:44.900> to<00:03:45.049> take<00:03:45.319> her<00:03:45.500> on<00:03:45.680> if

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
I didn't feel ready to take her on if

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.800 
I didn't feel ready to take her on if
that<00:03:46.160> makes<00:03:46.430> sense<00:03:46.879> Lorelei<00:03:47.360> may<00:03:47.569> be<00:03:47.630> the

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
that makes sense Lorelei may be the

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.900 
that makes sense Lorelei may be the
first<00:03:48.079> in<00:03:48.260> line<00:03:48.470> but<00:03:48.739> much<00:03:48.920> like<00:03:49.190> will<00:03:49.489> she's

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
first in line but much like will she's

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.089 
first in line but much like will she's
definitely<00:03:50.569> no<00:03:50.690> pushover<00:03:51.170> I<00:03:51.500> played<00:03:51.890> through

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.099 
definitely no pushover I played through

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:53.410 
definitely no pushover I played through
yellow<00:03:52.370> and<00:03:52.610> that's<00:03:52.730> probably<00:03:53.180> where

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
yellow and that's probably where

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.120 
yellow and that's probably where
Lorelei's<00:03:53.810> team<00:03:54.079> is<00:03:54.230> at<00:03:54.349> its<00:03:54.500> best<00:03:54.769> in<00:03:55.010> the

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
Lorelei's team is at its best in the

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.949 
Lorelei's team is at its best in the
original<00:03:55.519> games<00:03:55.790> though<00:03:56.150> the<00:03:56.299> battle<00:03:56.599> against

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
original games though the battle against

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:58.569 
original games though the battle against
her<00:03:57.049> was<00:03:57.200> memorable<00:03:57.620> from<00:03:58.040> a<00:03:58.130> character

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
her was memorable from a character

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:00.550 
her was memorable from a character
perspective<00:03:59.209> I<00:03:59.360> initially<00:03:59.660> found<00:04:00.019> Lorelei<00:04:00.500> to

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
perspective I initially found Lorelei to

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.920 
perspective I initially found Lorelei to
be<00:04:00.799> a<00:04:00.829> bit<00:04:01.160> mysterious<00:04:01.430> as<00:04:02.180> you<00:04:02.420> get<00:04:02.569> the<00:04:02.720> least

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
be a bit mysterious as you get the least

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.930 
be a bit mysterious as you get the least
amount<00:04:03.170> of<00:04:03.290> info<00:04:03.590> about<00:04:03.799> her<00:04:04.010> herself<00:04:04.220> out<00:04:04.819> of

amount of info about her herself out of

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.880

the<00:04:05.000> original<00:04:05.480> Elite<00:04:05.720> Four<00:04:06.019> so<00:04:06.379> I<00:04:06.410> thought<00:04:06.769> it

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
the original Elite Four so I thought it

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.110 
the original Elite Four so I thought it
was<00:04:06.980> great<00:04:07.280> when<00:04:07.519> firered<00:04:07.940> and<00:04:07.970> leafgreen

was great when firered and leafgreen

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.089 
was great when firered and leafgreen

also<00:05:38.789> I<00:05:38.819> guess<00:05:39.210> I<00:05:39.389> should<00:05:39.719> mention<00:05:39.930> that<00:05:40.169> kogas

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
how cool that is already but you know

00:05:50.549 --> 00:05:50.559 

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:52.859 

now<00:05:51.279> when<00:05:51.489> you<00:05:51.639> think<00:05:51.669> of<00:05:52.059> dragon-type<00:05:52.569> in

00:05:52.859 --> 00:05:52.869 
now when you think of dragon-type in

now when you think of dragon-type in
elite<00:05:53.139> for<00:05:53.439> the<00:05:53.739> first<00:05:54.009> trainer<00:05:54.369> that

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:54.579 
elite for the first trainer that

00:05:54.579 --> 00:05:56.609 
elite for the first trainer that
probably<00:05:55.029> comes<00:05:55.269> to<00:05:55.479> mind<00:05:55.689> is<00:05:55.869> Lance<00:05:56.169> he's

00:05:56.609 --> 00:05:56.619 
probably comes to mind is Lance he's

00:05:56.619 --> 00:05:58.619 
probably comes to mind is Lance he's
undoubtedly<00:05:57.219> the<00:05:57.399> strongest<00:05:57.969> dragon<00:05:58.179> trainer

00:05:58.619 --> 00:05:58.629 
undoubtedly the strongest dragon trainer

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:00.419 
undoubtedly the strongest dragon trainer
but<00:05:58.959> I<00:05:59.139> think<00:05:59.379> he's<00:05:59.499> better<00:05:59.679> recognized<00:06:00.219> as<00:06:00.399> a
