the<00:03:24.090> patch<00:03:24.330> in<00:03:24.780> my<00:03:25.380> opinion<00:03:25.730> was<00:03:26.730> quite<00:03:27.060> bad

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
the patch in my opinion was quite bad

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.740 
the patch in my opinion was quite bad
because<00:03:28.280> it's<00:03:29.280> made<00:03:29.520> connection<00:03:30.120> problems<00:03:30.510> a

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
because it's made connection problems a

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.230 
because it's made connection problems a
lot<00:03:30.810> worser<00:03:31.470> you've<00:03:31.830> probably<00:03:32.240> experienced

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
lot worser you've probably experienced

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.840 
lot worser you've probably experienced
it's<00:03:33.450> already<00:03:33.570> or<00:03:34.230> watch<00:03:34.770> videos<00:03:34.800> on<00:03:35.310> it<00:03:35.550> but

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
it's already or watch videos on it but

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.020 
it's already or watch videos on it but
the<00:03:36.060> connection<00:03:36.330> is<00:03:36.810> really<00:03:37.230> bad<00:03:37.530> like<00:03:38.030> some

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
the connection is really bad like some

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.090 
the connection is really bad like some
games<00:03:39.330> it<00:03:39.810> was<00:03:39.960> just<00:03:40.110> lag<00:03:40.500> even<00:03:40.950> though<00:03:41.040> it

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
games it was just lag even though it

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.120 
games it was just lag even though it
since<00:03:41.340> you've<00:03:41.460> got<00:03:41.580> full<00:03:41.850> bars<00:03:42.060> and<00:03:43.130> you'll

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
since you've got full bars and you'll

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.100 
since you've got full bars and you'll
have<00:03:44.250> to<00:03:44.400> say<00:03:44.520> like<00:03:44.810> connection<00:03:45.810> interrupted

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
have to say like connection interrupted

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.800 
have to say like connection interrupted
and<00:03:46.860> you'll<00:03:47.610> still<00:03:47.820> be<00:03:47.970> moving<00:03:48.270> around<00:03:48.390> and

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
and you'll still be moving around and
