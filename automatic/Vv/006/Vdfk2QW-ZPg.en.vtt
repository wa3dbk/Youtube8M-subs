 Russian drama to blastbit all 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.780
 new items comes first 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.100
 it is in this store 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:41.530
 so stay tuned for blast beat news 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.900
 attention in this video is given only general 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.660
 information about the plates I play on them 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.130
 but I will be quite a bit if you want 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.010
 hear detailed sound 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:54.220
 click on each plate separately 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.230
 This link leads to 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.080
 youtube channel where every dish 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.480
 dedicated to a single video as much as possible 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:05.799
 full sound reflecting instrument 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:08.530
 with all the nuances of sound 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:11.920
 lay out without processing the way it 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:15.220
 takes the microphone and now let's 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.560
 watch touch and listen start with 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.660
 packaging every plate wright packed 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.830
 But in such a box and hi-hat in 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.989
 smaller box 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.940
 In my opinion this is a big plus because 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.980
 that all other manufacturers sell 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.690
 their products in bags that can 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.989
 burst from contact with sharp 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.440
 Skeet Ukraine appearance appearance 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.450
 the view is pretty good in my opinion 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.300
 and not against competitors looks very 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.060
 adequately all the plates have a unique 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.310
 coating representing the thinnest 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.600
 layer at that 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.510
 natural mineral artificially 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.890
 grown on the surface of the alloy 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.720
 chemical reaction animating particles 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.240
 kuprikov alloy surface sometimes 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.910
 creates fancy patterns and colorful 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:04:00.980
 divorces giving to each tool 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:02.890
 individuality as a protective 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.560
 coating used composition 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:08.390
 particle saturated 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.990
 polytetrafluoroethylene polymer over 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:14.150
 slip this coating creates 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.940
 the thinnest film protecting the alloy from 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.530
 aggressive environment 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.609
 thanks to this cover for you 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.160
 easy to care 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.860
 without using abrasives or 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.620
 Acid cleaners are enough 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.760
 just wipe the plate with soft felt 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:33.410
 or cotton cloth 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.270
 Now let's talk separately about technology 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.630
 manufacture of each batch of plates and 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:41.180
 then compare their sound crystal series 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.940
 crystal series is the hardest to imagine 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.610
 whether cymbals and candida sims whole series 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.880
 made exclusively by machine deep 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.830
 concentric forged with flowing edge 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.510
 imperial series 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.970
 imperial series is exclusively manual 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:59.270
 work performed by a wide technique 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:02.690
 dense and deep rare cat series 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:05.300
 the alliance of the body of the plates is divided into 2 zones 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.700
 thick center made 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.419
 machine forging turning into thin 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.000
 extreme 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:14.300
 forged and flow only 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.300
 manually and now the most important sound 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:20.270
 First , let's compare hi-hat 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.640
 different series hi-hat crystal according to mine 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.740
 sensations this move has the brightest 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.600
 compared to the rest of the sound also 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.970
 it seemed that he was a little louder than his 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.630
 fellow sound dominated by high 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.850
 garth on 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:34.280
 thanks to which the tool protects 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:36.830
 distinct sound even with intense 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.110
 the game in my opinion such a hi-hat will be 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.500
 good at having hard sound 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.450
 muses 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:45.080
 that is, in various extreme 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:45.830
 rock and metal hi-hat directions 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.830
 imperial 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:51.530
 has a very tight and dry sound with 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.960
 moderate sand at the sound of this 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.260
 hit seems to me the most 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.820
 balanced sound 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:59.150
 what makes it universal 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:01.220
 tool for a variety of genres from 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:05.060
 owls iv anko do rock music 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:07.430
 hi-hat alliance this tool has 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:10.040
 the warmest sound of everyone else 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.900
 presented in this review machine 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.330
 forging gives it a sound density 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.160
 edge processed manually fills 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.830
 sound colorful overtones 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:21.919
 in my opinion this tool is better 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.960
 best suited for jazz sola funk and 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:27.950
 any old school warlock 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:31.040
 Now let's compare the Rubik crystal series 

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:33.440
 this plate has a pronounced upward 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:36.110
 and punch well articulate her 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:39.860
 sounding with a ringing white death to it 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:41.630
 we read very fine notes on 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:44.390
 my mind is such a wright will be good 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.460
 stiff having tight south music and in 

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:48.880
 different maximum directions and 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:52.940
 rock and metal 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:55.460
 imperial series has a dense saturated 

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:58.010
 sound with moderate sustain was at it 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:00.130
 not very bright plate also not bad 

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:02.330
 sounds if you play it like a roof 

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:06.440
 range of use it seems to me 

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:11.060
 wholesale funk to yellow burst series 

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:12.269
 the alliance has the darkest of all 

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:15.279
 other tariffs 

00:07:12.269 --> 00:07:16.809
 has moderate sustain and totally 

00:07:15.279 --> 00:07:19.269
 inexpressive g. 

00:07:16.809 --> 00:07:21.939
 if you like active use 

00:07:19.269 --> 00:07:24.279
 bell then this plate is not for you 

00:07:21.939 --> 00:07:25.029
 at the same time it shows itself well in 

00:07:24.279 --> 00:07:27.279
 roof quality 

00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:30.069
 this plate is more for jazz and 

00:07:27.279 --> 00:07:31.479
 optional arm in which genre is better 

00:07:30.069 --> 00:07:34.029
 to use this or that plate 

00:07:31.479 --> 00:07:35.859
 Of course you decide I just expressed 

00:07:34.029 --> 00:07:38.709
 their preferences on ladies yet 

00:07:35.859 --> 00:07:39.699
 Well, we wish the guys good luck in 

00:07:38.709 --> 00:07:43.149
 noble cause 

00:07:39.699 --> 00:07:45.569
 and wait for the roof splash hey eachine she 

00:07:43.149 --> 00:07:48.159
