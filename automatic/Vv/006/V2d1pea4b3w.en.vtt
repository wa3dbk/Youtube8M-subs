so my thoughts are in our jet flying
here<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:52.920> shock<00:00:53.250> wave<00:00:53.430> them<00:00:53.610> off<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.789> bomb

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
here and shock wave them off the bomb

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.369 
here and shock wave them off the bomb
but<00:00:54.120> I'm<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.239> little<00:00:54.600> late<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:54.960> I'm<00:00:55.050> gonna<00:00:55.140> go

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
but I'm a little late and I'm gonna go

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.080 
but I'm a little late and I'm gonna go
through<00:00:55.590> with<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.800> strategy<00:00:56.129> anyways<00:00:56.579> I'm

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
through with the strategy anyways I'm

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.970 
through with the strategy anyways I'm
gonna<00:00:57.180> knock<00:00:57.449> them<00:00:57.629> back<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.440> I'm<00:00:58.500> gonna<00:00:58.590> put

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
gonna knock them back and I'm gonna put

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.400 
gonna knock them back and I'm gonna put
my<00:00:59.280> health<00:00:59.609> down<00:00:59.789> right<00:01:00.090> away<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:01.079> turret

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
my health down right away and a turret

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.810 
my health down right away and a turret
and<00:01:01.559> then<00:01:01.680> choose<00:01:01.920> much<00:01:02.129> as<00:01:02.250> possible<00:01:02.609> take

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
and then choose much as possible take

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.460 
and then choose much as possible take
care<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.090> scout<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.899> then<00:01:04.019> try<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.199> fly

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
care of the scout and then try to fly

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.179 
care of the scout and then try to fly
away<00:01:04.739> but<00:01:05.339> no<00:01:06.150> dice<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:07.470> leader<00:01:07.680> takes<00:01:07.979> me

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
away but no dice and the leader takes me

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.820 
away but no dice and the leader takes me
out<00:01:08.990> so<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.020> might<00:01:10.170> have<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.409> rethink<00:01:10.560> that

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
out so I might have to rethink that

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.350 
out so I might have to rethink that
strategy<00:01:10.979> later<00:01:11.340> especially<00:01:12.030> if<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.210> bomb

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
strategy later especially if the bomb

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.730 
strategy later especially if the bomb
has<00:01:12.540> already<00:01:12.659> been<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.020> fuse<00:01:13.229> but<00:01:13.470> it's<00:01:13.560> just<00:01:13.680> a

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
has already been to fuse but it's just a

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.320 
has already been to fuse but it's just a
good<00:01:13.890> strategy<00:01:14.100> if<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.490> hasn't<00:01:14.760> been<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.000> look

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
good strategy if it hasn't been and look

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.480 
good strategy if it hasn't been and look
at<00:01:15.420> this<00:01:15.479> couch<00:01:15.720> Oh<00:01:16.020> miss<00:01:16.830> tamela<00:01:17.130> he<00:01:17.310> just

just shooting into this cluster

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.340 
just shooting into this cluster
hopefully<00:01:24.210> getting<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.540> kill<00:01:24.869> getting<00:01:25.229> an

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
hopefully getting that kill getting an

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.920 
hopefully getting that kill getting an
assist<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.159> noticed<00:01:26.670> we<00:01:26.880> got<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.330> bunch<00:01:27.810> of

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
assist and I noticed we got a bunch of

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.630 
assist and I noticed we got a bunch of
them<00:01:28.049> destroyed<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:29.070> leader<00:01:29.310> picked<00:01:29.520> up

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
them destroyed and I leader picked up

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.880 
them destroyed and I leader picked up
the<00:01:29.729> bomb<00:01:29.909> so<00:01:30.509> not<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.049> best<00:01:31.229> decision<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.740> run

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
the bomb so not the best decision to run

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.170 
the bomb so not the best decision to run
through<00:01:32.159> there<00:01:32.400> in<00:01:32.520> front<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.909> leader<00:01:33.090> I

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
through there in front of the leader I

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
through there in front of the leader I
should<00:01:33.360> have<00:01:33.450> just<00:01:33.570> probably<00:01:33.659> stayed<00:01:34.049> behind

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
should have just probably stayed behind

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.940 
should have just probably stayed behind
him<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.799> he'll<00:01:35.159> burn<00:01:35.310> as<00:01:35.460> he<00:01:35.640> went<00:01:35.759> through

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
him and he'll burn as he went through

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.380 
him and he'll burn as he went through
but<00:01:37.950> we<00:01:38.340> still<00:01:38.520> gotta<00:01:38.700> plant<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.000> either<00:01:39.119> way

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
but we still gotta plant it either way

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.240 
but we still gotta plant it either way
so<00:01:39.990> I'm<00:01:40.200> gonna<00:01:40.320> look<00:01:40.560> for<00:01:40.619> this<00:01:40.860> over<00:01:41.070> shield

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
so I'm gonna look for this over shield

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.100 
so I'm gonna look for this over shield
quick<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.790> then<00:01:42.030> I'm<00:01:42.119> gonna<00:01:42.210> make<00:01:42.450> way<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.840> the

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
quick and then I'm gonna make way to the

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.499 
quick and then I'm gonna make way to the
bombs<00:01:43.350> planted<00:01:44.070> site<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.850> I'm<00:01:45.210> gonna<00:01:45.299> see<00:01:45.479> if

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
bombs planted site and I'm gonna see if

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.240 
bombs planted site and I'm gonna see if
I<00:01:45.600> can<00:01:45.750> shock<00:01:45.990> them<00:01:46.259> off<00:01:46.409> there<00:01:46.649> but<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.100> time

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
I can shock them off there but this time

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.889 
I can shock them off there but this time
it's<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.579> did<00:01:47.820> defuse<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.390> I'm<00:01:48.509> smarter

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
it's a did defuse it and I'm smarter

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:49.999 
it's a did defuse it and I'm smarter
than<00:01:48.930> last<00:01:49.140> time<00:01:49.259> I'm<00:01:49.409> not<00:01:49.470> gonna<00:01:49.649> go<00:01:49.799> in<00:01:49.890> there

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
than last time I'm not gonna go in there

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.469 
than last time I'm not gonna go in there
and<00:01:50.070> I'm<00:01:50.250> gonna<00:01:50.430> try<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.700> hold<00:01:50.970> them<00:01:51.060> off<00:01:51.240> at

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
and I'm gonna try to hold them off at

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.270 
and I'm gonna try to hold them off at
their<00:01:51.600> base<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.049> we<00:01:52.290> can<00:01:52.439> get<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.740> bomb

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
their base so that we can get the bomb

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.410 
their base so that we can get the bomb
back<00:01:53.579> somewhere<00:01:54.360> close<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:55.140> plant<00:01:55.770> spot

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
back somewhere close to the plant spot

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.310 
back somewhere close to the plant spot
so<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.450> noticed<00:01:57.719> they're<00:01:57.810> taking<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.170> long

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.770 
that's an over shield matrix for my team
and<00:02:40.760> then<00:02:41.760> here<00:02:41.909> I<00:02:41.939> fly<00:02:42.150> right<00:02:42.420> back<00:02:42.540> to<00:02:42.719> the

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
and then here I fly right back to the

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.539 
and then here I fly right back to the
bottom<00:02:43.019> spot<00:02:43.230> got<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.739> keep<00:02:43.889> the<00:02:44.040> pressure<00:02:44.280> on

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
bottom spot got to keep the pressure on

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.690 
bottom spot got to keep the pressure on
up<00:02:44.939> one<00:02:45.450> nothing<00:02:45.659> I<00:02:46.079> like<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:46.680> jump<00:02:47.189> and<00:02:47.340> melee

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
up one nothing I like to jump and melee

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.009 
up one nothing I like to jump and melee
with<00:02:47.819> this<00:02:48.030> bomb<00:02:48.239> when<00:02:48.419> I<00:02:48.510> got<00:02:48.720> it<00:02:48.870> just

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
with this bomb when I got it just

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.509 
with this bomb when I got it just
because<00:02:49.230> you<00:02:49.319> got<00:02:49.349> a<00:02:49.470> lunge<00:02:49.739> forward<00:02:50.159> and<00:02:50.400> you

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
because you got a lunge forward and you

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.009 
because you got a lunge forward and you
can<00:02:50.669> be<00:02:51.060> a<00:02:51.090> lot<00:02:51.209> quicker<00:02:51.389> look<00:02:51.689> at<00:02:51.780> that<00:02:51.900> and

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
can be a lot quicker look at that and

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:53.990 
can be a lot quicker look at that and
then<00:02:52.139> I<00:02:52.200> guess<00:02:52.349> decorated<00:02:53.280> like<00:02:53.340> a<00:02:53.400> Christmas

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
then I guess decorated like a Christmas

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.369 
then I guess decorated like a Christmas
tree<00:02:54.030> and<00:02:54.299> that<00:02:54.329> guy<00:02:54.480> just<00:02:54.540> destroys<00:02:55.139> me<00:02:57.379> so

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
tree and that guy just destroys me so

00:02:58.379 --> 00:02:59.899 
tree and that guy just destroys me so
that's<00:02:58.590> not<00:02:58.680> bad<00:02:58.859> i<00:02:58.889> didn't<00:02:59.189> i<00:02:59.250> decided<00:02:59.579> not<00:02:59.790> to

00:02:59.899 --> 00:02:59.909 
that's not bad i didn't i decided not to
