00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
definitely say put the claymore to the

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.100 
definitely say put the claymore to the
rear<00:01:08.939> because<00:01:09.210> if<00:01:09.330> someone's<00:01:09.630> rushing<00:01:09.990> like

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
rear because if someone's rushing like

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.810 
rear because if someone's rushing like
if<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.350> have<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.500> spider<00:01:11.070> bite<00:01:11.189> on<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.670> other

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
if you have a spider bite on the other

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.969 
if you have a spider bite on the other
side<00:01:12.180> they're<00:01:12.990> gonna<00:01:13.080> find<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.470> way<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.650> rush

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
side they're gonna find a way to rush

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.310 
side they're gonna find a way to rush
through<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.610> if<00:01:15.540> they<00:01:15.659> flank<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.110> that's

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
through and if they flank you that's

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.539 
through and if they flank you that's
where<00:01:16.530> you're<00:01:16.680> sort<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:16.950> highly<00:01:17.250> susceptible

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
where you're sort of highly susceptible

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.340 
where you're sort of highly susceptible
so<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.210> would<00:01:18.479> have<00:01:18.600> actually<00:01:18.720> taken<00:01:19.080> that

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
so I would have actually taken that

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.530 
so I would have actually taken that
claim<00:01:19.590> or<00:01:19.770> now<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.700> place<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.330> rear

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
claim or now and place it to the rear

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.179 
claim or now and place it to the rear
facing<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.020> rear<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.350> then<00:01:22.470> focusing

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
facing the rear and then focusing

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.350 
facing the rear and then focusing
forward<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.700> way<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:23.820> don't<00:01:23.939> have<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.180> worry

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
forward that way I don't have to worry

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.670 
forward that way I don't have to worry
about<00:01:24.479> anyone<00:01:24.750> coming<00:01:25.049> from<00:01:25.229> behind<00:01:25.350> and

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
about anyone coming from behind and

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.710 
about anyone coming from behind and
knifing<00:01:26.070> me<00:01:26.130> or<00:01:26.640> shooting<00:01:26.970> me<00:01:27.060> in<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.210> back<00:01:27.270> I

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
knifing me or shooting me in the back I

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.760 
knifing me or shooting me in the back I
got<00:01:28.409> nailed<00:01:28.650> this<00:01:28.799> guy<00:01:28.920> here<00:01:29.990> again<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.290> know<00:01:31.470> he

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
got nailed this guy here again I know he

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.950 
got nailed this guy here again I know he
was<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.130> was<00:01:32.340> one<00:01:32.579> v<00:01:32.790> three<00:01:33.240> or<00:01:33.390> four<00:01:33.659> for<00:01:33.869> him

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
was it was one v three or four for him

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.810 
was it was one v three or four for him
so<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.200> mean<00:01:34.650> he<00:01:34.740> was<00:01:34.860> camping<00:01:35.280> there<00:01:35.490> because

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
so I mean he was camping there because

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.819 
so I mean he was camping there because
likely<00:01:36.390> he<00:01:36.570> needed<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.930> call<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.320> numbers<00:01:37.619> he

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
likely he needed to call the numbers he

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.679 
likely he needed to call the numbers he
was<00:01:37.950> trying<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.340> take<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.520> safe<00:01:39.060> position<00:01:39.240> so

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
was trying to take a safe position so

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.240 
was trying to take a safe position so
that<00:01:39.720> he<00:01:39.960> could<00:01:40.140> snag<00:01:40.530> one<00:01:40.799> or<00:01:40.950> two<00:01:41.100> and

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
that he could snag one or two and

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.830 
that he could snag one or two and
balance<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.759> off<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.329> i<00:01:42.390> don't<00:01:42.570> i<00:01:42.750> don't

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
balance it off so i don't i don't

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.569 
balance it off so i don't i don't

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:47.410 
they are not expecting and so you must

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:49.290 
they are not expecting and so you must
take<00:06:47.620> a<00:06:47.680> tactical<00:06:48.280> position<00:06:48.670> when<00:06:48.790> the<00:06:48.820> safest

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:49.300 
take a tactical position when the safest
