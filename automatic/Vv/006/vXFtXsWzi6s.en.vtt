demonstration you see several years ago
when<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.270> discovered<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:19.140> benefits<00:00:19.619> of

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
when I discovered the benefits of

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.370 
when I discovered the benefits of
ceramic<00:00:20.250> window<00:00:20.609> film<00:00:20.880> I<00:00:21.180> had<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.109> figure<00:00:22.260> out

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
ceramic window film I had to figure out

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.140 
ceramic window film I had to figure out
a<00:00:22.470> way<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.710> demonstrate<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:23.369> I<00:00:23.580> didn't<00:00:23.910> know

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
a way to demonstrate it I didn't know

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.820 
a way to demonstrate it I didn't know
what<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.359> heat<00:00:24.510> box<00:00:24.750> was<00:00:24.990> at<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:25.289> point<00:00:25.529> that

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
what the heat box was at that point that

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.250 
what the heat box was at that point that
sort<00:00:26.279> of<00:00:26.369> evolved<00:00:26.760> over<00:00:27.000> time<00:00:27.210> but<00:00:27.840> I<00:00:27.900> went<00:00:28.170> to

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
sort of evolved over time but I went to

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.169 
sort of evolved over time but I went to
my<00:00:28.349> local<00:00:28.590> glass<00:00:28.949> company<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:29.699> was<00:00:29.880> able<00:00:30.119> to

on<00:00:56.100> this<00:00:56.250> class<00:00:56.660> what<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.690> would<00:00:57.899> do<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.289> just

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
on this class what I would do is I just

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.500 
on this class what I would do is I just
turned<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.859> light<00:00:59.039> on<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.640> I<00:01:00.000> would<00:01:00.059> just<00:01:00.329> ask

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
turned the light on and I would just ask

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.880 
turned the light on and I would just ask
customers<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:01.109> put<00:01:01.289> their<00:01:01.410> hand<00:01:01.559> on<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.739> other

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
customers to put their hand on the other

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.860 
customers to put their hand on the other
side<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.699> know<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.850> would<00:01:03.030> verify<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.660> this

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
side you know I would verify that this

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.440 
side you know I would verify that this
is<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.229> heat<00:01:05.220> source<00:01:05.400> they<00:01:05.700> could<00:01:05.880> fill<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.240> and

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
is a heat source they could fill it and

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.510 
is a heat source they could fill it and
we'd<00:01:06.750> go<00:01:06.930> behind<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.320> scenes<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.860> we<00:01:08.369> would

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
we'd go behind the scenes and we would

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.980 
we'd go behind the scenes and we would
just<00:01:08.729> start<00:01:08.820> showing<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.360> products<00:01:09.750> like<00:01:09.869> I

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
just start showing the products like I

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.170 
just start showing the products like I
do<00:01:10.049> with<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.439> heat<00:01:10.560> box<00:01:10.770> demonstration<00:01:11.520> this

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
do with the heat box demonstration this

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.690 
do with the heat box demonstration this
to<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:12.540> day<00:01:12.900> has<00:01:13.590> been<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.890> most<00:01:14.040> effective

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700
