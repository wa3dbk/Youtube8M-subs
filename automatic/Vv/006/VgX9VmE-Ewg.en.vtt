00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.710
 but 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.370
 here 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.370
 Yes 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.700
 just 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.830
 Yes 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.600
 Ah 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.430
 Well 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.590
 Ah 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.230
 Oh 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.220
 all right 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.560
 Yes 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.910
 Hey 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.880
 Hi 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.010
 and 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.370
 Oh 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.320
 and hands up 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.090
 all right 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:04:01.160
 oh oh 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.200
 haha 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.889
 live 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.210
 Yes 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.889
 and 

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:28.509
 No 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.430
 aria green victory of yours from the 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:11.100
 contest 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.229
 first hour is very good unfortunately he is 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.000
 particularly good is fifteen minutes was real 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:16.259
 equivalent 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.930
 the score actually at the right time 

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:21.210
 the 200 fast 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:23.340
 it stands behind as liberators 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.990
 that phase just played really well 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.430
 are you a very good opponent 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.350
 It certainly suggests that we whole 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:30.300
 good parties filled with all already think 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:32.729
 I think we would just as previous 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.169
 week alone now you come one or for and 

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:35.520
 we continue that line I will come to you too 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:37.169
 2 0 before and that is the difference with 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.660
 last week where you get a zero behind 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:41.699
 and yes I also really really like it 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.169
 have played good ones first 

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:46.919
 they put you in a video like that on it 

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:48.300
 anyway new plan usp-s there yes it 

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:49.650
 of course every year there is a lot 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.210
 new players are added last year 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.889
 according to which we started with six new ones 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.229
 are the season in the base 

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:56.250
 that's just the same every year and me 

00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:58.169
 think you have enough time in the 

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:59.099
 because you have to prepare each other 

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:00.150
 play 

00:06:59.099 --> 00:07:01.770
 and last week we got it first 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:03.210
 we can do technically poor only 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.410
 the school without me so kid the one 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:05.669
 otherwise all of them might also be behind 

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:07.289
 just be able to play such a match 

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:09.180
 jana Frederik was now just really really 

00:07:07.289 --> 00:07:11.130
 bad the first half hour well that is already 

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.580
 Enough said about it you should do scored 

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.830
 you not 

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:16.740
 frisian and therefore basically everything wrong 

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:17.610
 that went wrong of your week in the on 

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.889
 every way 

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:21.630
 to them today this performance is week 

00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:24.210
 just whole goods from good football 

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:26.010
 good win against a very good one 

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:27.870
 opponent and for me next to a nice one 

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:29.699
 it's a PhD student 's rev 

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:31.320
 some of no when fight like it too 

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:32.520
 There will of course be everything in the derby 

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.940
 for questions to the first points 

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.740
 go grab it 

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.030
 it is up to us to us against 

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.889
 we just have to be the first to arm 

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:39.360
 half as to lay on the mat 

00:07:37.889 --> 00:07:40.710
 from the start he and plenty of hits 

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:43.400
 nice football but I don't think so 

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:43.400
 the romantic
