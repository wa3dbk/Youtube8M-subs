00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.940
 to cook the spaghetti to the 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:11.620
 carbonara to our style 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:16.660
 We are going to need oil first 1 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:20.410
 teaspoon salt cheese cream a bit of 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:24.670
 cream to cook an onion 100 grams 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:27.630
 of bacon 1 egg and about 200 grams of 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.490
 pasta we have chosen spaghetti 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.259
 When the water breaks to boil, we will 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.259
 take a spoonful of salt 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.600
 and a splash of oil to prevent 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.660
 the paste sticks 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.030
 not too much a little 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.840
 then we throw the pasta so that 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.840
 start to boil I know 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.110
 we like it better than noodles 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.269
 they remain whole not to split them with which 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.730
 we are crushing them a little bit 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:00.020
 so that the water dark as it 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.900
 go folding 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.489
 if you want you can throw some spice 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.960
 the pasta to give it a little bit more 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.270
 taste this goes according to taste 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:13.000
 we are going to throw a little bit of 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.000
 Garlic powder a little bit of oregano 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.700
 and a little bit of nutmeg 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.290
 well, while they are boiling 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.690
 spaghetti what we are going to do is in 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.340
 Let's take a frying pan a little 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.010
 But you can also do it with 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.540
 sharp with oil we have chosen 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:38.890
 the butter that we forgot to say 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:42.030
 before to make the sofrito 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.590
 we let it melt 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.049
 Well, once the 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.049
 butter let's take the onion 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.860
 and we're going to let it burn 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.680
 medium 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.630
 until it takes a little bit of color 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.760
 Well, when the onion is already 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.960
 starting to brown a little bit we are going to 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.960
 add the bacon 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.300
 and we mix everything well while 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.400
 cool 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.230
 to make our sauce let's throw 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.350
 in a bowl an egg 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.900
 and two yolks 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.840
 a little bit of cream cheese that we have 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:37.790
 previously beaten in a cup we have 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.790
 specifically used two tablespoons 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.340
 and finally we are going to add cream 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.019
 cooking cream 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.860
 we're just going to use a cardboard because the 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.860
 rats for two people 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:59.130
 once we have thrown everything 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:02.580
 let's beat it again until everything 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.650
 well mixed well, well, that's how 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.510
 would be our sauce beaten and if 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.940
 you want you can throw a little bit of 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.560
 black pepper 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.560
 and beat it is a bit again 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.620
 and we would have our sauce made 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.890
 Well, once the gold has already 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:27.900
 bacon let's incorporate the sauce that 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.900
 we had been working previously 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.939
 and let everything mix well 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.939
 for a few minutes 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.860
 Well, once we have drained the 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:47.620
 pasta we have our sauce made let's go 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.620
 to put everything together in the pot 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.810
 we will do everything well with careful 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:59.829
 and we will move it so that all the pasta is 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:01.749
 soak in good sauce already 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:03.969
 we have ready our pasta dish to 

00:04:01.749 --> 00:04:06.249
 the carbonara with cream if you want you can 

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:08.330
 decorate it by throwing a bit of cheese 

00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:11.710
 above 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:14.710
 or serve it as it was 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:17.380
