00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
rabbit colony this is my little rabbit

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.290 
rabbit colony this is my little rabbit
colony<00:00:06.890> here's<00:00:07.890> the<00:00:08.040> big<00:00:08.220> tug<00:00:08.790> that<00:00:08.820> I<00:00:09.059> fill

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
colony here's the big tug that I fill

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.259 
colony here's the big tug that I fill
with<00:00:09.480> water<00:00:09.660> so<00:00:10.200> it's<00:00:10.349> easy<00:00:10.530> to<00:00:10.710> get<00:00:10.860> water<00:00:11.070> and

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:11.269 
with water so it's easy to get water and

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:13.580 
with water so it's easy to get water and
they<00:00:12.269> like<00:00:12.450> to<00:00:12.599> lay<00:00:12.809> up<00:00:12.840> against<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.440> edges

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
they like to lay up against the edges

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.220 
they like to lay up against the edges
because<00:00:14.519> it<00:00:14.700> gets<00:00:14.849> you<00:00:15.480> know<00:00:15.570> hundred<00:00:15.929> degrees

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
because it gets you know hundred degrees

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.070 
because it gets you know hundred degrees
so<00:00:17.190> it<00:00:17.340> gets<00:00:17.490> really<00:00:17.760> hot<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.840> when<00:00:18.990> I<00:00:19.020> took

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.050 
so it gets really hot and when I took
carriers<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.070> I<00:00:20.189> filled<00:00:20.430> with<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.670> bunch<00:00:20.850> of

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.810 
carriers and I filled with a bunch of
mud<00:00:21.270> over<00:00:21.660> them<00:00:21.840> so<00:00:22.199> they<00:00:22.380> could<00:00:22.619> hide<00:00:23.430> in

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820
