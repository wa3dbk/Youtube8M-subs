00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.880
 no more 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.690
 but nothing more to who we have until the 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.390
 today nothing more serious than in May 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.210
 chestnut the voice of goku and many 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.550
 other incredible voices that we have as 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.310
 bruce willis another one what would be good 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.530
 jim carrey canon de geminis are finally 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.680
 many too many and how many years in the 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.540
 dubbing mario 32 years 32 science says 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.700
 fast but it's been many years and 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.890
 it requires a great effort 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:59.620
 definitely hear is that you feel 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.450
 that you have generations already here no longer 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.400
 it's just a make-up tape like 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:08.950
 you said the conference is 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:10.720
 bruce willis is clear good inside 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.820
 dragonball also this ones that were 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.440
 children and they already grew now comes with the 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.540
 younger brother or with his children 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.430
 so if your generation is something 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.900
 wonderful the truth is that it is a 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.690
 magic that has dragon ball and dubbing 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.570
 and I'm lucky because part of 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.700
 is this of this environment in 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.659
 the one that I have to unwrap very 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.179
 grateful and very 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.069
 hey mario a lot of people would like to do the 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:37.969
 dream actually we know that we require 

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:40.310
 effort sweat a lot sacrifice 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:42.740
 many times and how did you get to do 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.259
 all this reality because we know that no 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.539
 it's easy and it's not strong but it's a 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.799
 consequence of the acts I saw them I do not think 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:49.759
 that you have to prepare you have to be 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.219
 ready for when the opportunity comes 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.439
 you have to study that is very important 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:56.539
 because the competition is strong then 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.729
 is that more than anything and perseverance not 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:00.799
 be there dedicate yourself to your thing about 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.780
 do it always well and surely the 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:05.390
 successes will come by themselves but 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.479
 always starting from the base of the study 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.390
 and the preparation that is how nice you 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.459
 has left this profession looks obviously 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.590
 live of it satisfy all 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.500
 needs of the family children in the 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.590
 school the food on the table and so on 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.180
 travel holidays etc but also 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.310
 the direct contact with people is that 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.530
 as an artist is something that in dubbing 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.600
 we do not get much though, thanks to 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.600
 I have achieved these characters 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.700
 I enjoy fortunately and there I am 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.930
 ran is one of the people that appear 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.850
 in the entertainment program also with 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.640
 us and he's a big fan of yours and he wants 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.260
 ask yourself a question about jordan mario 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.300
 he told us is that at the conference 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.060
 that the freezer saga is your favorite 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.920
 why do you prefer her at the same time 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.750
 oma jim watt cetera I think it's the 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.610
 essence of dragon ball is not the essence 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.620
 where goku faces this 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.060
 character frizer you know that freezer 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.430
 means freezer 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.020
 I always thought that Akira Toriyama 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.080
 play with vegetables like qatar or cough 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.120
 as vegueta as radix as napa as 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.220
 brolin and freezer is a freezer 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.770
 then they need original that the 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.390
 freezer kills vegetables then 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.880
 that's why I like it a lot and it's also the 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.380
 saga in which you change the boot is made 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.240
 man when it becomes your home already 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.220
 gina then for all that he enjoys it 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.370
 best 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.530
 and equal of all his characters of 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.570
 so many that have doubled in addition to goku 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.550
 because I know he would tell us something what is 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.920
 your favorite bruce willis and without clear and 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.890
 which one suits you more or you identify more 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.960
 the wonderful years that walk it said 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.490
 that undoubtedly are the two most 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.520
 important ones that I liked the most 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:42.490
 finish did not have something very special was 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.560
 someone great telling their stories of 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.990
 small and I think a lot of people 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.490
 identifies does not put all that this was what 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.560
 that artÃ¨ria made him identify himself 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.030
 with the people that I lived that part yes 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.620
 because they are very human stories very 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.230
 reals that happened to everyone 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.390
 it was not something that you said you know who 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.520
 happened to him the truth is that the majority of 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.900
 people succeeded the stories that 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.959
 they passed him to kevin and that's why they're there 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:08.440
 not everything talks about bing in this time that 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:09.940
 well did this say of and then it happened in 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.500
 that moment I knew exactly what 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.930
 had to do was always very 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:17.230
 melancholic reminding us and bruce willis 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:20.140
 and good for how many movies 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:23.530
 and the truth is that this lower part of me 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:26.770
 voice your doctor talks about those phrases 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.810
 as if we are not going to touch you I always kill you 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.490
 down, the voice is not difficult to keep 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.740
 but hey there is still the 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.660
 date and well the last one is more good not 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.730
 the last but so many I think that the 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.100
 most famous of all have been votes 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:41.110
 yes that's how it is goku because it has all those 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.700
 dragon ball followers the truth is that 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.830
 being a series that ended so many 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.350
 years still the fact that there are so many 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.240
 fans is amazing is something invaluable to 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.740
 they really are fans of us 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.930
 we suffer all the roll that there was 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.450
 practically for the dubbing and everything 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.580
 this and see what has finally been done 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:59.080
 He made many people very happy 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.150
 cinema was full at the premiere we had 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.490
 the premiere is precisely you that you feel 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.200
 Seeing all these people and as 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.970
 You made your life at the conference 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.890
 son with a lot of emotion because the truth 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.020
 is that when the series ends in the 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:13.600
 dubbing are finished and they go however 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.610
 dragon ball has not finished is not gone 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.320
 and it looks like there will still be dragon ball 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.150
 because there is still this 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:22.000
 dream of everything you've learned 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.590
 finally leave us a message 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.270
 with people that we like everything 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.920
 this roll and they want to follow your 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.440
 career and who want to live maybe 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.240
 some other dream what that message would be 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.470
 mixed mammary is the message would be that it 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.380
 prepare that dreams can be 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.540
 meet and you need a little luck 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.830
 but you have to be ready with studies 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.690
 with preparation for when the 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.670
 lucky for when the time comes in 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.440
 the one that opens the door and they give you that 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:47.170
 opportunity you must be prepared 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:50.020
 ok everything would be dismissed goku here in the 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:51.960
 program this version of 102.7 them 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.960
 I would say goodbye friends I send you a 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.960
 kamehameha 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.640
 we are chestnut brothers of the same air 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.640
 Show 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.410
 someone else wants to negotiate
