00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.460
 hello today i will you 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.540
 learn to solve two puzzles 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.160
 magic so the first the snapper so 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.880
 I knew how to create its functioning 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:19.130
 right after he's second a love is 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:23.359
 stuck in a resort must be removed 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:26.519
 so let's start with the sniper 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:31.349
 so I will first show you the 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:35.600
 purpose of the sniper then we get you 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:40.440
 you see here there is a little notch 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:44.219
 which allows to go hang that at the 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.129
 bottom of this hollow tube there is an elastic 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:51.690
 and you have to hang the little sprain 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:57.000
 for the elastic so that as you 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:01:00.660
 put in and you're shooting it and they 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.809
 come back but as many times as you 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.930
 want you can do it really 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.110
 as many times as you want then 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.900
 let's go to the explanation of this little trick 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:17.939
 by this casting 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:19.650
 so if most snappers there are 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.600
 elastics that goes over here for 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:26.040
 give a greater illusion and the 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.380
 mine is old so there is none in 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.040
 done for real there is no 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.770
 of elastics inside the tube so 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.729
 you have to pretend that there is 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.210
 an elastic but there is none at 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.250
 made 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:51.390
 when you go in the stem of which 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:54.810
 youtube you see here that's it it's 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.060
 by rectangular here so when you 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.219
 go get there you'll shoot with 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.530
 your fingers and you're going to squeeze with 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:05.790
 his two fingers there here the thumb and 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:09.060
 the index it was going to squeeze the tip and the 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.780
 stuff the the rod is going to leave and in 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.090
 compressing then you can 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:17.200
 from further away so I gently do you 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.790
 are like that and then squeeze you 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.220
 just a little training question 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.510
 but it's very easy to do 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.750
 so I hope this little thing you 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:31.800
 will then serve now let's move on to 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:36.400
 second test is so it's a spring 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.500
 with such a look on the sides there to 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.060
 double thickness 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.870
 so we can not get out of the ring 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:47.160
 listen then so I go first you 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:50.140
 quickly introduce the little trick 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:54.850
 the ring is stuck you can try 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.269
 to take him off that will not work he's 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.980
 stuck up 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:59.080
 he's really stuck there we do not see 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.989
 very well because it's a video but 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.410
 he's really stupid then it's 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:08.709
 just make a little magic pass 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:12.880
 hides a little bit their fate and 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:16.900
 the ring and there is just to lift the 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:19.150
 we and they remove one little quite 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:23.920
 things you see I put it back they are 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:26.410
 they always it's very easy and well 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.380
 there a little magic pass like everything to 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:33.040
 their task 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.560
 here is the noÃ© again stuck while 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.420
 I make the same gesture as earlier 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.239
 so let's go to the explanation of this 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.459
 little puzzle 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.380
 so when you go take your 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.700
 brain teaser 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:49.540
 you will first show that he 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.160
 is he well what it is 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.799
 then you can try it too 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.829
 to the spectators so that they are still 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:58.900
 slower then when you get here 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:02.079
 see when I hide a little bit with 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:06.850
 my fingers down with the ring you go 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:09.010
 rotate them like this with your 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.680
 fingers push you and you voted the most 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.200
 in the other direction so dear our 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.720
 life urges similar in each other 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.769
 meaning you put the hall back to the heap that 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.220
 you go down like these and you could 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.710
 vote 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.140
 so you have to have a little bit forced 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:30.740
 it's normal or a little last 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:32.540
 time for you see you vote well 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.190
 the ring I believe you do not have very 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.720
 well seen I'll show them there 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:42.170
 vote like these the ring and the tower 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:46.690
 is played I hope this little trick you 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:46.690
 serve to thank you and to the next
