here<00:00:25.820> and<00:00:26.820> there's<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.090> looks<00:00:27.779> like<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.930> Torx<00:00:28.289> bit

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
here and there's a looks like a Torx bit

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.269 
here and there's a looks like a Torx bit
there<00:00:29.990> and<00:00:30.990> that<00:00:31.140> Philips<00:00:31.470> screw<00:00:31.920> there<00:00:32.099> so

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
there and that Philips screw there so

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.010 
there and that Philips screw there so
I'll<00:00:32.369> begin<00:00:32.520> by<00:00:32.669> taking<00:00:32.880> those<00:00:33.149> three<00:00:33.630> screws

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
I'll begin by taking those three screws

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.549 
I'll begin by taking those three screws
out<00:00:34.460> all<00:00:35.460> right<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:35.730> use<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.120> t20<00:00:36.809> Torx<00:00:37.050> bit<00:00:37.380> to

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
out all right I use the t20 Torx bit to

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.350 
out all right I use the t20 Torx bit to
get<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:37.710> bolt<00:00:38.160> out<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.670> hole<00:00:38.910> there<00:00:39.180> but

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
get that bolt out of that hole there but

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.510 
get that bolt out of that hole there but
I<00:00:39.390> think<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.690> might<00:00:39.840> be<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:40.020> t25<00:00:40.920> but<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.309> didn't

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
I think it might be a t25 but I didn't

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.440

and pry it as close as I could to the

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.280 
and pry it as close as I could to the
pin<00:02:22.730> kind<00:02:23.239> of<00:02:23.299> move<00:02:23.420> around<00:02:23.510> each<00:02:23.840> pin<00:02:24.080> get

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
pin kind of move around each pin get

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.559 
pin kind of move around each pin get
really<00:02:24.500> close<00:02:24.709> with<00:02:24.830> a<00:02:24.950> screwdriver<00:02:25.450> pull<00:02:26.450> the
