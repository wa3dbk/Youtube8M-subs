00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
presentation you did today was something

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.720 
presentation you did today was something
I<00:00:52.260> thought<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.649> only<00:00:53.280> got<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.520> see<00:00:53.640> the

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
I thought I only got to see the

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.310 
I thought I only got to see the
beginning<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.329> but<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.539> was<00:00:54.660> rather<00:00:54.809> unique

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
beginning of it but it was rather unique

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.479 
beginning of it but it was rather unique
in<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.590> sense<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.100> wasn't<00:00:56.250> like<00:00:56.460> a

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
in a sense that it wasn't like a

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.189 
in a sense that it wasn't like a
traditional<00:00:56.969> Q&amp;A<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.510> thought<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:57.960> was<00:00:58.050> really

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
traditional Q&amp;A I thought it was really

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.900 
traditional Q&amp;A I thought it was really
great<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.949> way<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.190> he<00:00:59.250> can<00:00:59.399> well<00:00:59.519> you<00:00:59.820> know

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
great the way that he can well you know

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.110 
great the way that he can well you know
that<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.210> q<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.600> A's<00:01:00.739> are<00:01:01.739> fun<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.519> sometimes

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
that the q and A's are fun and sometimes

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.060 
that the q and A's are fun and sometimes
they're<00:01:03.480> still<00:01:03.690> eating<00:01:04.019> again<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.650> was<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.920> good

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
they're still eating again it was a good

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.760 
they're still eating again it was a good
way<00:01:05.160> to<00:01:05.190> get<00:01:05.340> laughs<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:06.110> and<00:01:07.110> tell<00:01:07.560> funny

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
way to get laughs and and tell funny

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.270 
way to get laughs and and tell funny
stories<00:01:08.299> but<00:01:09.299> I<00:01:09.360> thought<00:01:10.170> since<00:01:10.799> this<00:01:11.100> is

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
stories but I thought since this is

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.550 
stories but I thought since this is
probably<00:01:11.759> probably<00:01:12.000> I'll<00:01:12.840> say<00:01:13.080> this<00:01:13.229> tonight

probably probably I'll say this tonight

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.850 
probably probably I'll say this tonight
now<00:01:13.970> we're<00:01:14.970> almost<00:01:15.090> left<00:01:15.540> up<00:01:15.750> probably<00:01:16.590> my

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
now we're almost left up probably my

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.310 
now we're almost left up probably my
last<00:01:17.040> go-around<00:01:17.369> yeah<00:01:18.150> on<00:01:18.420> these<00:01:18.720> on<00:01:19.140> these

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
last go-around yeah on these on these

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.749 
last go-around yeah on these on these
events<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.799> have<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:19.950> couple<00:01:20.159> more<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.460> do<00:01:20.610> this

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
events I have a couple more to do this

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.580 
events I have a couple more to do this
year<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.540> think<00:01:21.840> we're<00:01:22.020> gonna<00:01:22.110> wrap<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.470> up

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
year and I think we're gonna wrap it up

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.530 
year and I think we're gonna wrap it up
and<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.250> thought<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.579> myself<00:01:23.610> this<00:01:24.180> would<00:01:24.360> be<00:01:24.509> a

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
and I thought to myself this would be a

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.899 
and I thought to myself this would be a
good<00:01:24.930> opportunity<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:26.130> do<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.310> little<00:01:26.520> bit<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.820> a

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
good opportunity to do a little bit of a

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.749 
good opportunity to do a little bit of a
retrospective<00:01:27.590> look<00:01:28.590> back<00:01:28.890> for<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.220> fans<00:01:29.490> and
