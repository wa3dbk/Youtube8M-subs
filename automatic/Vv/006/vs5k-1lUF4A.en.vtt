earlier you'll see what I mean I just
forgot<00:02:48.620> to<00:02:48.650> put<00:02:48.739> that<00:02:48.890> when<00:02:49.310> I<00:02:49.370> was<00:02:49.459> filming<00:02:49.730> I

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
forgot to put that when I was filming I

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
forgot to put that when I was filming I
don't<00:02:51.260> think<00:02:51.380> it's<00:02:51.470> that<00:02:51.590> big<00:02:51.709> of<00:02:51.800> a<00:02:51.890> deal<00:02:52.040> you

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
don't think it's that big of a deal you

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.970 
don't think it's that big of a deal you
know<00:02:53.260> it's<00:02:54.260> just<00:02:54.350> a<00:02:54.500> small<00:02:54.769> detail<00:02:56.739> now<00:02:57.739> put

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
know it's just a small detail now put

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.150 
know it's just a small detail now put
the<00:02:58.489> circle<00:02:59.000> thing<00:02:59.150> there

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
the circle thing there

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.600 
the circle thing there
what<00:03:01.160> we'll<00:03:01.280> do<00:03:01.430> now<00:03:01.610> just<00:03:02.180> draw<00:03:02.420> it<00:03:02.480> in<00:03:02.630> nicely

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
what we'll do now just draw it in nicely

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:13.920 
what we'll do now just draw it in nicely
and<00:03:05.110> then<00:03:06.110> another<00:03:06.500> mini<00:03:06.890> circle<00:03:07.310> inside<00:03:07.790> it

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.559 

and<00:03:14.019> then<00:03:14.680> another<00:03:15.010> circle<00:03:15.400> below<00:03:16.090> that<00:03:16.329> one

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
and then another circle below that one

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:23.849 
and then another circle below that one
which<00:03:17.439> I<00:03:17.620> will<00:03:17.769> try<00:03:17.950> now<00:03:21.090> like<00:03:22.090> so<00:03:22.420> and<00:03:22.959> do<00:03:23.739> the

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
which I will try now like so and do the

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:33.500 
which I will try now like so and do the
same<00:03:24.099> to<00:03:24.310> the<00:03:24.430> other<00:03:24.459> side

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.040 

that<00:03:34.049> kind<00:03:34.319> of<00:03:34.349> sucked

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
that kind of sucked

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.600 
that kind of sucked
hopefully<00:03:36.800> yours<00:03:37.010> will<00:03:37.160> look<00:03:37.250> better<00:03:37.430> than

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
hopefully yours will look better than

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.520 
hopefully yours will look better than
this<00:03:37.700> one<00:03:37.910> I'm<00:03:38.180> not<00:03:38.330> really<00:03:38.390> putting<00:03:39.320> much

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
this one I'm not really putting much

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.750 
this one I'm not really putting much
effort<00:03:39.740> into<00:03:40.010> this<00:03:40.510> by<00:03:41.510> anyways<00:03:42.100> and<00:03:43.100> on<00:03:43.580> this

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
effort into this by anyways and on this

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:44.830 
effort into this by anyways and on this
as<00:03:43.970> you<00:03:44.120> can<00:03:44.150> see<00:03:44.300> on<00:03:44.360> this<00:03:44.420> one<00:03:44.510> there's<00:03:44.780> a

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
as you can see on this one there's a

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.100 
as you can see on this one there's a
bunch<00:03:45.020> of<00:03:45.170> little<00:03:45.770> lines<00:03:46.130> on<00:03:46.640> the<00:03:47.000> chest<00:03:47.360> of

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
bunch of little lines on the chest of

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.440 
bunch of little lines on the chest of
the<00:03:48.140> Iron<00:03:48.380> Man<00:03:48.620> and<00:03:48.890> the<00:03:49.160> so<00:03:50.090> we're<00:03:50.210> gonna<00:03:50.300> be

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
doing that now so the little v-shape at

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.330 
doing that now so the little v-shape at
the<00:03:56.030> top<00:03:56.240> the<00:03:56.690> lines<00:03:57.260> that<00:03:57.650> kind<00:03:57.860> of<00:03:57.920> outline

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
the top the lines that kind of outline

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.260 
the top the lines that kind of outline
the<00:03:58.580> circle<00:03:59.030> and<00:03:59.330> the<00:04:00.200> lines<00:04:00.860> that<00:04:01.010> go<00:04:01.130> in<00:04:01.550> form

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
the circle and the lines that go in form

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.020 
the circle and the lines that go in form
this<00:04:02.510> kind<00:04:03.050> of<00:04:03.140> ABS<00:04:03.620> I<00:04:04.280> don't<00:04:04.550> know<00:04:04.640> for<00:04:04.880> how

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
this kind of ABS I don't know for how

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.620 
this kind of ABS I don't know for how
metal<00:04:05.540> can<00:04:05.720> have<00:04:05.900> abs<00:04:06.200> but<00:04:06.680> you<00:04:06.980> know<00:04:07.100> whatever

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
metal can have abs but you know whatever

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:16.240 
metal can have abs but you know whatever
that's<00:04:08.630> what<00:04:08.780> it<00:04:08.840> looks<00:04:08.960> like<00:04:14.800> to<00:04:15.800> draw<00:04:16.100> that

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
that's what it looks like to draw that

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:27.080 
that's what it looks like to draw that
in

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.010 

oh<00:04:27.120> yeah<00:04:27.630> I<00:04:27.690> just<00:04:27.930> want<00:04:28.230> to<00:04:28.320> say<00:04:28.580> that<00:04:29.660> this<00:04:30.660> is

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
oh yeah I just want to say that this is

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.620 
oh yeah I just want to say that this is
taking<00:04:31.500> this<00:04:31.980> making<00:04:32.730> this<00:04:32.820> Ironman<00:04:33.270> is<00:04:33.450> gonna

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
taking this making this Ironman is gonna

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.360 
taking this making this Ironman is gonna
take<00:04:33.900> a<00:04:33.930> lot<00:04:34.169> longer<00:04:34.320> than<00:04:34.650> about<00:04:34.770> what<00:04:35.280> it

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
take a lot longer than about what it

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.580 
take a lot longer than about what it
seems<00:04:35.690> cuz<00:04:36.690> it'll<00:04:36.870> wait<00:04:37.050> for<00:04:37.260> the<00:04:37.320> paint<00:04:37.530> to

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
seems cuz it'll wait for the paint to

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.730 
seems cuz it'll wait for the paint to
dry<00:04:37.680> because<00:04:38.100> if<00:04:38.250> you<00:04:38.340> don't<00:04:38.550> it<00:04:39.510> gets<00:04:39.780> like<00:04:40.080> it

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
dry because if you don't it gets like it

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.250 
dry because if you don't it gets like it
looks<00:04:41.010> horrible<00:04:41.190> when<00:04:41.610> you<00:04:41.669> try<00:04:41.850> to<00:04:42.169> paint<00:04:43.169> the

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
looks horrible when you try to paint the

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.420 
looks horrible when you try to paint the
different<00:04:43.590> colors<00:04:43.860> on<00:04:43.980> top<00:04:44.070> of<00:04:44.220> each<00:04:44.310> other

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
different colors on top of each other

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.640 
different colors on top of each other
when<00:04:44.669> it's<00:04:44.790> still<00:04:45.000> wet<00:04:45.240> so<00:04:46.169> make<00:04:46.380> sure<00:04:46.410> it's

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
when it's still wet so make sure it's

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.950 
when it's still wet so make sure it's
dry<00:04:47.120> when<00:04:48.120> you<00:04:48.150> do<00:04:48.300> this<00:04:50.090> and<00:04:51.090> two<00:04:51.360> lines<00:04:51.600> there

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
dry when you do this and two lines there

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.290 
dry when you do this and two lines there
and<00:04:52.940> it<00:04:53.940> looks<00:04:54.210> basically<00:04:54.780> right<00:04:55.010> and<00:04:56.300> next

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300
