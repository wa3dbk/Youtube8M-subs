is an extruded copolymer so compared to
the<00:00:54.050> previous<00:00:54.469> example<00:00:55.010> this<00:00:55.579> one<00:00:55.879> features<00:00:56.449> a

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
the previous example this one features a

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.189 
the previous example this one features a
3d<00:00:56.960> lower<00:00:57.230> stretch<00:00:57.710> and<00:00:58.010> is<00:00:58.820> much<00:00:58.999> faster<00:00:59.359> on

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
3d lower stretch and is much faster on

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:02.380 
3d lower stretch and is much faster on
sinking<00:01:00.679> twice<00:01:01.339> you<00:01:01.609> think<00:01:01.879> smart

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
sinking twice you think smart

could have been improved on was it

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.350 
could have been improved on was it
sinking<00:01:15.530> liner<00:01:15.890> it<00:01:16.220> took<00:01:16.550> a<00:01:16.580> while<00:01:16.820> to<00:01:16.880> sink

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
sinking liner it took a while to sink

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.550 
sinking liner it took a while to sink
