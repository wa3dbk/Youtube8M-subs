00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
the absolute standard of truth truth

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.750 
the absolute standard of truth truth
still<00:03:30.820> is<00:03:31.030> divisive<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:33.250> only<00:03:33.430> way<00:03:33.519> to<00:03:33.580> come

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
still is divisive the only way to come

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.750 
still is divisive the only way to come
together<00:03:33.940> is<00:03:34.330> through<00:03:34.930> error<00:03:35.320> and<00:03:36.360> deception
