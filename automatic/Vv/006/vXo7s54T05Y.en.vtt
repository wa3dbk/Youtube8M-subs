00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.069
 often there is a need 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.360
 connect two computers more often 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.890
 total deep stationary 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:12.659
 computers 

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:14.939
 goals of sharing game files over a network or 

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:16.189
 organization simultaneous 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:17.509
 internet access 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:19.689
 there is yes many many but many 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:20.609
 ways 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.239
 but also madonna cable 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:26.829
 interface api directx 11 94 and connections using 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:28.939
 twisted pair 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:30.970
 however, so many ways 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.780
 do various problems arise and 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.210
 disadvantages such as joining at 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.350
 help norm long cable is necessary 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.620
 availability of kompakt about both devices 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:40.520
 and most modern 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.550
 computers and its solved 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.700
 similar sites where 13 94 with the only 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.030
 the difference is that this connector is not on the old 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.010
 computers 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.440
 stand up fight requires acquisition 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.620
 access point settings that are not always 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.390
 cost effective 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.980
 in my opinion the fastest and 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.230
 cost effective solution 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.110
 will become information computers usually 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.600
 network cable and twisted pair 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.540
 almost all computers are equipped 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.320
 Internet adapters or network cards 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.409
 and if not installed it can 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.150
 purchase for the sum of about three hundred rubles 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.770
 who can have such a connection 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.720
 near advantages long range 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.480
 high speed action 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.710
 noise immunity ease on building and 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.530
 ease of use 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.130
 only but 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.860
 This is what you need for this special 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.410
 cable so-called crossover 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.080
 the whole secret is that 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.230
 posting sequence 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:34.950
 such a cable guest 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.740
 at opposite ends of the cable 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.240
 placed and matched 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.780
 special scheme 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.660
 so disassemble the first side of the computer 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.920
 according to the scheme where 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.300
 bella orange 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.550
 Orange 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.240
 white and green 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.240
 chilich 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.640
 almost nothing 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.450
 White blue 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.210
 spare 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.210
 white brown and of course 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:20.409
 Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov 

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:27.419
 May landscapes with a credit card 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.189
 now accordingly 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:32.109
 parsing the other side of the ship 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:35.109
 the sequence will be different 

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:39.339
 first comes white green 

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:41.139
 green 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:44.139
 then white orange 

00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:52.279
 Sydney 

00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:55.279
 white blue 

00:02:59.869 --> 00:03:02.319
 orange and white brown and 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.319
 brown 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.769
 similar built maxxi fork 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.459
 we clamp to the Internet 

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:38.029
 and then a piece of network cable 

00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:40.389
 according to the scheme is very expensive 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:42.389
 reliable means to connect up 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:43.739
 small network computers
