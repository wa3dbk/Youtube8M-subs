00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.759
 4 dukan diet'm doing is using this 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:35.340
 recipe at home and everyone loves 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.360
 so I decided to share revenue with 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.289
 you 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:44.000
 so come on let's go in the ingredients 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:47.760
 We're going to need half a pot of yogurt. 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.179
 natural skim can not be advanced 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:55.519
 is the people 3 tablespoons of 

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:55.519
 sweetener the one for oven and stove 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.100
 two bananas are small 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.769
 I'm using here chopped silver banana 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.020
 neither slices here so easy and mince 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.290
 or not because we 're going to hit the 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:14.970
 more or less here. 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:18.210
 three bananas are sliced just for the 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.760
 decor if here is optional, if you 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.430
 do not want to put do not need 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.950
 The interesting thing is the banana in the mass but 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:33.630
 this one at heart is at the discretion of 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:42.300
 You 're in the dust three games. 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:43.830
 whole one cup of oat bran and 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.960
 baking powder 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.960
 I'm using this one from uel. 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:58.370
 so let's go the first thing that 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:02:00.900
 people will do is hit the eggs with the 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:07.160
 people will put the three games the 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:15.560
 the diced banana indicator 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:15.560
 Daddy and hit 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.630
 done that we will start to 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:35.230
 mix the other ingredients then the 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:44.190
 People are going to put oat bran in the 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:48.160
 yogurt and cinnamon powder that is 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:51.060
 August the original recipe is more or 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.060
 minus 1 tablespoon 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:03:02.770
 I like, I really like cinnamon and 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:07.080
 cinnamon will knock again last 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.080
 Let's add Flemish so let's go 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:36.010
 Now we're going to add a spoon. 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:40.330
 soup is ready can not do much 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:42.340
 Why do you ask for a race? 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:47.230
 now we'll put a shape 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:49.960
 to raise the square is in the form of 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:53.020
 silicone to use great I do not have 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:56.410
 so I'll use it is a way of 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:58.780
 common aluminum will in that way 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:02.500
 I 'm already here at other times 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:05.370
 channel you in a little oil but it is 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.800
 little bit even take the paper towel 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.900
 folds over this oil and spreads 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.470
 in full shape then the paper towel will 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:18.010
 absorb this fat and okay then I will 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:21.130
 tattooing how to put the brand leads to 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.560
 to pass I 'm using is a form 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.720
 is now coming to 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.830
 cake mass and take to spend 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:33.250
 if you do not use the banana it is sliced â€‹â€‹like 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:36.160
 I said no, I'll use this one you. 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:39.280
 can already put straight into the lining right 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.919
 counts or silicone that you will use 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.990
 and in my case I'm going to put the 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:47.669
 bananas to face the cake 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.669
 then the dough will come 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:45.419
 so it stayed like this 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:51.120
 now I'll take it to the oven more or 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:52.560
 less than 200 and 10 degrees and I'm going to sap it by 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.110
 30 minutes 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:59.610
 It's there, I'll come back to show you 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:01.469
 as was our cam of banana cake 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:07.379
 so the staff our banana cake 

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:10.219
 It was so super wet marcyo no 

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:15.590
 give no work to misinform 

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:19.409
