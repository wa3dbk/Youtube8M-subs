00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.689

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.300

 create tournaments already got that is 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.980
 very fucking expensive this floor is not a 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.500
 sponsorship of the coup if it were not enough 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.540
 it is only recognition because who 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.489
 do you know the dance program want photos for 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.399
 create an app until it pops up photo 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.469
 face that makes a living doing it right 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.899
 and we will give a force that the guy she 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.070
 have no one else's photo do not fuck if 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.579

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.570
 the game chance of the uol that is taking to the foot 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.660
 of the letter 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.609
 2 the two people 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.160
 the people who play there guys 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.960
 can do a tournament there is cool to 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.530
 people play football and enter 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.420
 other 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.710
 but it is the following to this mark is very 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.150
 but we did it 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.299
 The cool thing is that the person can call 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:16.020
 the day of the smartphone turns on the other plays and the 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.270
 it can also weigh there like that 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.189
 I hope you like to play there then 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.780
 being different on the channel 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.270
 so I hope you like it 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.330
 Also and this is now as follow that 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:31.040
 connects with what John does all the time 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.040
 the whole process is going there then 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.600
 the ghetto is a very good goal 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.729
 each player will have a bow to 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.259
 defeat the other and so the game works 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.750
 and each of the players will have to 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:54.939
 connected to the same wireless network 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:02:05.289
 the developer said that soon the game 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:02:07.239
 would have bluetooth compatibility for 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.009
 playing the game is very simple 

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:10.720
 after opening the application you will tighten 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.760

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.530

 same wireless network yet its case 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.940
 depending on where you are 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.019
 you can enable the router's own 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.639
 your smartphone 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.010
 after that the two players at the same 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:39.670
 time to touch the screen and hold for someone 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.690
 with this 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.389
 After that you 'll have to choose 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.579
 Triggered the game thanks without you 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:47.410
 release a package all nÃ© it only has one 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:50.859
 ship but if you buy the other 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:53.650
 ships will cost the company of 6 50 more 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:55.690
 it is not with the ship only is it fun and 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.060

 that your cool friends of the game is that 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.540
 You have to look at your smartphone. 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.400
 This ends up causing fights between you. 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.230
 and his friend but it is less 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:15.639
