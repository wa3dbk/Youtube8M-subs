lights are not powering on and basically
this<00:00:11.309> can<00:00:11.490> occur<00:00:11.730> when<00:00:12.269> your<00:00:12.480> body<00:00:13.080> control

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
this can occur when your body control

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.540 
this can occur when your body control
module<00:00:13.769> your<00:00:14.219> BC<00:00:14.700> in<00:00:14.849> is<00:00:15.470> the<00:00:16.470> fuse<00:00:16.770> is<00:00:16.920> out<00:00:17.100> or

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
module your BC in is the fuse is out or

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.370 
module your BC in is the fuse is out or
the<00:00:18.119> control<00:00:18.449> module<00:00:18.570> itself<00:00:18.990> is<00:00:19.199> stopped

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
the control module itself is stopped

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.859 
the control module itself is stopped
working<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:19.949> basically<00:00:20.640> we've<00:00:21.210> got<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.480> little

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
working and basically we've got a little

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.689 
working and basically we've got a little
few<00:00:22.320> covers<00:00:22.590> so<00:00:22.859> we<00:00:22.949> sitting<00:00:23.220> right<00:00:23.369> in<00:00:23.400> here

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
few covers so we sitting right in here

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.370 
few covers so we sitting right in here
and<00:00:24.150> you'll<00:00:24.330> just<00:00:24.480> reach<00:00:24.689> in<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.019> pop<00:00:25.199> this

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
and you'll just reach in and pop this

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.259 
and you'll just reach in and pop this
out<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.650> it'll<00:00:26.580> come<00:00:26.699> out<00:00:26.849> like<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.119> and

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
out and it'll come out like that and

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.269 
out and it'll come out like that and
then<00:00:27.420> come<00:00:27.570> off<00:00:27.660> like<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.199> then<00:00:28.769> we've

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
then come off like that and then we've

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.040 
then come off like that and then we've
got<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.490> whole<00:00:29.640> bunch<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:29.970> fuses<00:00:30.359> right<00:00:30.630> here

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
got a whole bunch of fuses right here

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.549 
got a whole bunch of fuses right here
now<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.650> fuse<00:00:32.070> that's<00:00:32.279> missing<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.840> BCM

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
now the fuse that's missing is the BCM

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.639 
now the fuse that's missing is the BCM
power<00:00:35.010> saver<00:00:35.520> fuse<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.960> one<00:00:37.110> above<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.469> is

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
power saver fuse and the one above it is

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.040 
power saver fuse and the one above it is
the<00:00:37.790> audio<00:00:38.790> /<00:00:39.180> BCM

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
the audio / BCM

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.840 
the audio / BCM
so<00:00:40.620> as<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.879> got<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.030> 15<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.750> 10<00:00:43.020> now<00:00:43.710> ours<00:00:44.100> was

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
so as you got a 15 and a 10 now ours was

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.600 
so as you got a 15 and a 10 now ours was
the<00:00:45.030> 15<00:00:45.480> so<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.960> 10<00:00:46.200> or<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.620> 15<00:00:47.010> sitting<00:00:47.370> right

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
the 15 so the 10 or the 15 sitting right

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.330 
the 15 so the 10 or the 15 sitting right
there<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.090> going<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.750> be<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.989> problem<00:00:49.320> fuse<00:00:49.770> so

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
there is going to be the problem fuse so

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.220 
there is going to be the problem fuse so
on<00:00:50.610> here<00:00:51.300> I'll<00:00:51.570> show<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.899> little<00:00:51.989> picture

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
/ PCM and then um BCM battery saver so

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.819 
/ PCM and then um BCM battery saver so
yeah<00:01:00.030> check<00:01:00.270> those<00:01:00.420> fuses<00:01:00.899> if<00:01:01.230> one's<00:01:01.559> blown

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
yeah check those fuses if one's blown

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.470 
yeah check those fuses if one's blown
replace<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.579> then<00:01:03.090> I'll<00:01:03.180> fix<00:01:03.359> your

interior lights or anything else your
BCM<00:01:06.180> controls<00:01:06.600> it'll<00:01:06.930> help<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.560> power<00:01:07.799> back

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
BCM controls it'll help the power back

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.160 
BCM controls it'll help the power back
on<00:01:07.979> so<00:01:08.210> okay<00:01:09.210> guys<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.630> one<00:01:09.930> more<00:01:10.140> little

quick thing I noticed it's kind of tough
to<00:01:12.600> get<00:01:12.689> these<00:01:12.900> fuses<00:01:13.350> out<00:01:13.500> because<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.430> the

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
to get these fuses out because of the

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.340 
to get these fuses out because of the
angle<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.119> box<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.479> fitnah<00:01:15.869> it's<00:01:16.049> hard<00:01:16.259> to

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
angle of the box of fitnah it's hard to

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.719 
angle of the box of fitnah it's hard to
get<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.500> pair<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.740> pliers<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.310> pull<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.640> out

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
get a pair of pliers in to pull it out

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.469 
get a pair of pliers in to pull it out
and<00:01:17.939> what<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.720> use<00:01:19.140> was<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.220> pair<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.820> 90-degree

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
and what I use was a pair of 90-degree

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.880 
and what I use was a pair of 90-degree
pliers<00:01:21.750> this<00:01:22.020> is<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.140> pair<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.350> 60-inch

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
pliers this is a pair of 60-inch

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.890 
pliers this is a pair of 60-inch
90-degree<00:01:23.490> pliers<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:24.060> was<00:01:24.479> able<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.720> just

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
90-degree pliers I was able to just

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.050 
90-degree pliers I was able to just
reach<00:01:25.140> in<00:01:25.290> there<00:01:25.500> pull<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.430> then<00:01:26.729> with<00:01:26.909> my

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
left hand I pull while I'm I'm clamping

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.010 
left hand I pull while I'm I'm clamping
down<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.579> you'll<00:01:33.090> grab<00:01:33.360> on<00:01:33.540> something<00:01:33.869> and

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
down and you'll grab on something and

down and you'll grab on something and
you'll<00:01:34.140> better<00:01:34.350> just<00:01:34.470> pop<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.860> fuse<00:01:35.100> right

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
you'll better just pop that fuse right

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.700 
you'll better just pop that fuse right
out<00:01:35.400> so<00:01:35.670> again<00:01:36.479> 90<00:01:37.079> degree<00:01:37.290> pliers<00:01:37.530> this
