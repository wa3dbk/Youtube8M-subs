court of thorns and roses by Sarah J
mass<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.950> we<00:01:08.850> are<00:01:09.030> very<00:01:09.060> behind<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.600> curve<00:01:09.750> on

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
mass and we are very behind the curve on

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.170 
mass and we are very behind the curve on
this<00:01:10.049> we<00:01:10.470> know<00:01:10.710> but<00:01:11.010> none<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:11.850> us<00:01:11.970> are<00:01:12.090> ready

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
this we know but none of us are ready

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.030 
this we know but none of us are ready
yet<00:01:12.420> obviously<00:01:13.049> we<00:01:13.350> really<00:01:13.590> want<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.770> read<00:01:13.920> it

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
and I think there's a lot of people that

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.670 
and I think there's a lot of people that
were<00:01:15.119> kind<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.390> straggling<00:01:15.930> behind<00:01:15.990> because

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
were kind of straggling behind because

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.140 
were kind of straggling behind because
of<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.950> hype<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.400> kind<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.670> going<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.880> put<00:01:18.060> it

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
of the hype and kind of going to put it

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.999 
of the hype and kind of going to put it
