00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
powered car in the world what are you

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.480 
powered car in the world what are you
going<00:02:19.820> to<00:02:19.880> do<00:02:19.970> here<00:02:20.150> this<00:02:20.330> weekend<00:02:20.860> well<00:02:21.860> it

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
going to do here this weekend well it

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:23.680 
going to do here this weekend well it
would<00:02:22.640> be<00:02:22.670> nice<00:02:22.880> to<00:02:23.030> duplicate<00:02:23.450> it<00:02:23.480> but<00:02:23.660> I

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
would be nice to duplicate it but I

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.960 
would be nice to duplicate it but I
don't<00:02:23.780> think<00:02:23.960> I<00:02:24.080> can<00:02:24.380> tires<00:02:25.370> are<00:02:25.580> different

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
don't think I can tires are different

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.200 
don't think I can tires are different
and<00:02:26.590> at<00:02:27.590> that<00:02:27.680> race<00:02:28.070> that<00:02:28.220> was<00:02:28.370> 250<00:02:28.940> pounds

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
and at that race that was 250 pounds

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.270 
and at that race that was 250 pounds
lighter<00:02:29.390> so<00:02:30.380> I<00:02:30.410> think<00:02:30.530> that's<00:02:30.830> where<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.040> mile

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
lighter so I think that's where the mile

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.570 
lighter so I think that's where the mile
an<00:02:31.400> hour<00:02:31.520> and<00:02:31.910> some<00:02:32.180> of<00:02:32.270> the<00:02:32.330> ETS<00:02:32.600> came<00:02:32.780> from

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
an hour and some of the ETS came from

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.040 
an hour and some of the ETS came from
we've<00:02:34.580> gone<00:02:34.760> a<00:02:34.790> couple<00:02:35.000> of<00:02:35.150> 799<00:02:35.660> that's

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
we've gone a couple of 799 that's

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.630 
we've gone a couple of 799 that's
working<00:02:36.470> trying<00:02:36.680> to<00:02:36.740> get<00:02:36.860> front<00:02:37.220> half<00:02:37.370> of<00:02:37.490> my

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
working trying to get front half of my

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.270 
working trying to get front half of my
quarter<00:02:38.630> mile<00:02:38.810> a<00:02:38.840> little<00:02:39.140> faster<00:02:39.590> try<00:02:39.980> to<00:02:40.040> get

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
quarter mile a little faster try to get

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.040 
quarter mile a little faster try to get
Jason<00:02:40.760> he's<00:02:40.970> always<00:02:41.209> fast<00:02:41.450> as<00:02:41.630> the<00:02:41.780> eighth<00:02:41.900> and

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
Jason he's always fast as the eighth and

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.750 
Jason he's always fast as the eighth and
everybody<00:02:42.410> else<00:02:42.620> and<00:02:42.890> that's<00:02:43.490> what<00:02:43.580> I'm<00:02:43.640> going

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
everybody else and that's what I'm going

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.880 
everybody else and that's what I'm going
to<00:02:43.850> work<00:02:43.940> on<00:02:44.150> hopefully<00:02:44.330> we<00:02:44.570> can<00:02:44.660> get<00:02:44.750> there<00:02:44.959> so

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
to work on hopefully we can get there so

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.979 
to work on hopefully we can get there so
far<00:02:46.190> we've<00:02:46.370> got<00:02:46.580> yourself<00:02:47.090> we've<00:02:47.390> got<00:02:47.660> Sean

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
far we've got yourself we've got Sean

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.290 
far we've got yourself we've got Sean
and<00:02:48.320> Jason<00:02:48.770> all<00:02:48.950> in<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:49.220> seventh<00:02:49.670> what's<00:02:50.150> that

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
and Jason all in the seventh what's that

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.760 
and Jason all in the seventh what's that
going<00:02:50.450> to<00:02:50.510> be<00:02:50.660> on<00:02:50.810> elimination<00:02:51.230> day<00:02:51.410> what's

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
going to be on elimination day what's

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.550 
going to be on elimination day what's
the<00:02:51.830> deal<00:02:52.100> I<00:02:52.989> don't<00:02:53.989> know<00:02:54.050> it's<00:02:54.260> going<00:02:54.380> to<00:02:54.440> be

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
the deal I don't know it's going to be

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.920 
the deal I don't know it's going to be
close<00:02:54.800> i<00:02:55.010> think<00:02:55.220> Shanna<00:02:55.700> Sean<00:02:56.120> and<00:02:56.390> Jason<00:02:56.870> are

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
close i think Shanna Sean and Jason are

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.240 
close i think Shanna Sean and Jason are
probably<00:02:57.230> going<00:02:57.350> to<00:02:57.440> be<00:02:57.530> a<00:02:57.560> little<00:02:57.709> faster

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
probably going to be a little faster

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.580 
probably going to be a little faster
than<00:02:58.280> I<00:02:58.520> am<00:02:58.730> so<00:02:59.450> hopefully<00:02:59.660> you<00:03:00.140> know<00:03:00.260> the<00:03:00.380> tree

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
than I am so hopefully you know the tree

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.190 
than I am so hopefully you know the tree
sometimes<00:03:00.980> a<00:03:01.100> big<00:03:01.250> equalizer<00:03:01.520> and<00:03:02.120> you<00:03:03.020> never

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
sometimes a big equalizer and you never

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.260 
sometimes a big equalizer and you never
know<00:03:03.380> it's<00:03:03.590> drag<00:03:03.800> radial<00:03:04.220> things<00:03:05.030> going<00:03:05.209> to

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
know it's drag radial things going to

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:06.430 
know it's drag radial things going to
happen<00:03:05.540> so<00:03:05.660> I<00:03:05.690> guess<00:03:05.900> we<00:03:06.020> just<00:03:06.050> got<00:03:06.290> to<00:03:06.350> get

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
happen so I guess we just got to get

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.960 
happen so I guess we just got to get
close<00:03:06.680> if<00:03:06.860> i<00:03:06.890> can<00:03:07.040> stay<00:03:07.100> within<00:03:07.340> a<00:03:07.459> half<00:03:07.640> a<00:03:07.730> tent

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
close if i can stay within a half a tent

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.490 
close if i can stay within a half a tent
