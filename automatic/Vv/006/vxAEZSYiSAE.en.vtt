00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.090 

my<00:01:21.640> whole<00:01:21.790> concept<00:01:22.150> is<00:01:22.330> about<00:01:22.600> palettes<00:01:23.590> paint

my whole concept is about palettes paint

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.880 
my whole concept is about palettes paint
palettes<00:01:24.520> but<00:01:24.790> more<00:01:25.180> than<00:01:25.300> that<00:01:25.360> it's<00:01:25.890> a

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
palettes but more than that it's a

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.770 
palettes but more than that it's a
system<00:01:27.550> that<00:01:27.670> helps<00:01:27.909> narrow<00:01:28.270> down<00:01:28.570> the

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
system that helps narrow down the

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.600 
system that helps narrow down the
process<00:01:29.020> of<00:01:29.470> choosing<00:01:29.680> is<00:01:30.070> supposed<00:01:30.370> to<00:01:30.520> go

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
process of choosing is supposed to go

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.650 
process of choosing is supposed to go
into<00:01:30.760> the<00:01:30.910> big<00:01:31.090> wall<00:01:31.330> and<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.890> allows<00:01:33.160> them<00:01:33.520> to

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
into the big wall and it allows them to

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.980 
into the big wall and it allows them to
simplify<00:01:34.660> by<00:01:35.110> taking<00:01:36.040> a<00:01:36.130> quiz<00:01:36.400> to<00:01:37.180> discover

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
simplify by taking a quiz to discover

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.650

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
to help that process but more than that

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.560 
to help that process but more than that
it's<00:01:44.170> also<00:01:44.290> about<00:01:44.500> personality<00:01:45.250> so<00:01:45.580> it<00:01:46.390> also

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570

when<00:04:43.820> they're<00:04:43.880> painting<00:04:44.180> is<00:04:44.450> where<00:04:44.810> do<00:04:44.900> I<00:04:44.960> stop

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
when they're painting is where do I stop

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.110 
when they're painting is where do I stop
and<00:04:45.620> where<00:04:45.770> do<00:04:45.860> I<00:04:45.920> start<00:04:46.250> paint<00:04:46.850> what<00:04:46.940> I'm
