welcome to the rest of garden today I
want<00:00:02.760> to<00:00:02.820> profile<00:00:03.659> the<00:00:04.290> glacier<00:00:04.770> it's<00:00:04.920> a

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
want to profile the glacier it's a

want to profile the glacier it's a
tomato<00:00:05.190> I've<00:00:05.339> been<00:00:05.460> growing<00:00:05.609> for<00:00:05.970> five<00:00:06.180> years

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
tomato I've been growing for five years

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.750 
tomato I've been growing for five years
it's<00:00:06.960> built<00:00:07.290> as<00:00:07.470> a<00:00:07.500> semi<00:00:07.830> determinate<00:00:08.490> tomato

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
it's built as a semi determinate tomato

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.629 
it's built as a semi determinate tomato
which<00:00:09.630> I'm<00:00:10.139> not<00:00:10.290> sure<00:00:10.679> exactly<00:00:10.980> what<00:00:11.340> that<00:00:11.460> is

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
which I'm not sure exactly what that is

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.070 
which I'm not sure exactly what that is
what<00:00:11.790> it<00:00:11.880> means<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.269> me<00:00:12.389> is<00:00:12.509> it's<00:00:12.719> not<00:00:12.870> gonna

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
what it means to me is it's not gonna

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.930 
what it means to me is it's not gonna
set<00:00:13.559> its<00:00:13.710> fruit<00:00:13.920> at<00:00:14.040> once<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.429> die<00:00:14.549> out<00:00:14.730> like<00:00:14.910> a

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
set its fruit at once and die out like a

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.120 
set its fruit at once and die out like a
determinate<00:00:15.540> variety<00:00:15.900> and<00:00:16.080> it's<00:00:16.680> really<00:00:16.920> not

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
determinate variety and it's really not

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.680 
determinate variety and it's really not
going<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.369> grow<00:00:17.520> six<00:00:17.880> seven<00:00:18.180> eight<00:00:18.300> feet<00:00:18.480> tall

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
going to grow six seven eight feet tall

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.390 
going to grow six seven eight feet tall
like<00:00:18.750> you<00:00:19.140> know<00:00:19.410> your<00:00:19.590> indeterminate<00:00:19.859> cherry

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
like you know your indeterminate cherry

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.340 
like you know your indeterminate cherry
tomatoes<00:00:20.789> therefore<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:21.660> think<00:00:21.750> it's<00:00:22.050> great

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
tomatoes therefore I think it's great

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.439 
tomatoes therefore I think it's great
for<00:00:22.619> containers<00:00:23.130> you<00:00:23.220> can<00:00:23.279> see<00:00:23.580> this<00:00:23.730> one<00:00:23.970> is

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
for containers you can see this one is

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.349 
for containers you can see this one is
growing<00:00:24.810> in<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.019> container<00:00:25.640> it<00:00:26.640> is<00:00:26.849> pretty<00:00:27.119> tall

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
growing in a container it is pretty tall

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.849 
growing in a container it is pretty tall
it's<00:00:27.570> already<00:00:27.810> at<00:00:27.900> five<00:00:28.140> feet<00:00:28.500> I've<00:00:28.680> been

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
it's already at five feet I've been

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.550 
it's already at five feet I've been
eating<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.760> fruit<00:00:30.060> off<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.630> this<00:00:30.720> vine<00:00:30.960> for<00:00:31.320> at

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
eating the fruit off of this vine for at

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.709 
eating the fruit off of this vine for at
least<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.920> week<00:00:32.070> or<00:00:32.219> so<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:33.030> sets<00:00:33.360> fruit<00:00:33.630> in

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
least a week or so it sets fruit in

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.130 
least a week or so it sets fruit in
about<00:00:33.899> 55<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.829> 60<00:00:35.250> days<00:00:35.480> it's<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.600> really<00:00:36.960> good

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
about 55 to 60 days it's a really good

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.750 
about 55 to 60 days it's a really good
producer<00:00:37.380> in<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.950> heat<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.309> can<00:00:38.520> see<00:00:38.550> the

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
producer in the heat you can see the

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.790 
producer in the heat you can see the
green<00:00:38.969> tomatoes<00:00:39.390> coming<00:00:39.750> in<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.290> heat<00:00:40.500> didn't

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
green tomatoes coming in the heat didn't

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.920 
green tomatoes coming in the heat didn't
slow<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.160> down<00:00:41.219> at<00:00:41.550> all<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:41.969> had<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.540> little<00:00:42.750> bit

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
slow it down at all it had a little bit

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.350 
slow it down at all it had a little bit
of<00:00:43.050> die<00:00:43.230> back<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.829> little<00:00:44.489> bit<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.820> disease<00:00:45.120> but

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
of die back a little bit of disease but

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.029 
of die back a little bit of disease but
I<00:00:45.420> continued<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.899> spray<00:00:46.260> but<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.530> can<00:00:46.649> see<00:00:46.860> all

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
I continued to spray but you can see all

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.810 
I continued to spray but you can see all
the<00:00:47.280> green<00:00:47.460> tomatoes<00:00:48.000> on<00:00:48.180> there<00:00:49.460> the<00:00:50.460> glacier

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
the green tomatoes on there the glacier

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.540 
the green tomatoes on there the glacier
tastes<00:00:51.030> like<00:00:51.180> any<00:00:51.360> other<00:00:51.600> cherry<00:00:52.230> tomato<00:00:52.620> it's

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
tastes like any other cherry tomato it's

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.350 
tastes like any other cherry tomato it's
not<00:00:53.789> watery

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
not watery

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.090 
not watery
I<00:00:54.449> hate<00:00:54.690> describing<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.440> flavor<00:00:55.710> because<00:00:55.949> it's

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
I hate describing a flavor because it's

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.220 
I hate describing a flavor because it's
really<00:00:56.460> hard<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.879> do<00:00:57.030> but<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.750> does<00:00:57.899> have<00:00:58.079> its

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
really hard to do but it does have its

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.020 
really hard to do but it does have its
sweetness<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.800> does<00:00:58.949> have<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.399> tomato<00:00:59.699> taste

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
sweetness it does have the tomato taste

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.849 
sweetness it does have the tomato taste
and<00:01:00.239> it's<00:01:00.629> just<00:01:00.870> not<00:01:01.050> water<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.379> do<00:01:01.500> really

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
and it's just not water I do really

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.130 
and it's just not water I do really
really<00:01:02.039> enjoy<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.640> again<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.600> produces

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
really enjoy it and again it produces

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.320 
really enjoy it and again it produces
early<00:01:04.559> it's<00:01:05.070> great<00:01:05.430> for<00:01:05.640> containers<00:01:06.150> that's

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
early it's great for containers that's

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.780 
early it's great for containers that's
what<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.450> would<00:01:06.600> recommend<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:07.500> for<00:01:07.740> it's<00:01:08.490> not<00:01:08.760> a

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
what I would recommend it for it's not a

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.640 
what I would recommend it for it's not a
cherry<00:01:09.210> tomato<00:01:09.330> that's<00:01:09.840> going<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.229> get<00:01:10.380> out<00:01:10.500> of

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
cherry tomato that's going to get out of

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.710 
cherry tomato that's going to get out of
control<00:01:10.890> most<00:01:11.130> indeterminate<00:01:12.030> varieties<00:01:12.180> of

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
control most indeterminate varieties of

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.289 
control most indeterminate varieties of
cherries<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.590> just<00:01:13.890> can't<00:01:14.159> grow<00:01:14.460> in<00:01:14.700> pots<00:01:14.970> and

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
cherries you just can't grow in pots and

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.960 
cherries you just can't grow in pots and
I<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:16.020> grew<00:01:16.439> determinate<00:01:17.130> varieties<00:01:17.250> this<00:01:17.670> year

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
I I grew determinate varieties this year

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.600 
I I grew determinate varieties this year
and<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.540> really<00:01:18.750> don't<00:01:18.869> like<00:01:19.049> them<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:20.009> don't

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
and I really don't like them I don't

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.490 
and I really don't like them I don't
like<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.880> fact<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.360> they<00:01:21.540> die<00:01:21.720> off<00:01:21.990> die<00:01:22.320> off

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
like the fact that they die off die off

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.499 
like the fact that they die off die off
so<00:01:23.220> I'm<00:01:23.340> going<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.580> try<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:23.850> look<00:01:23.939> for<00:01:24.000> next

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
so I'm going to try and look for next

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.630 
so I'm going to try and look for next
year<00:01:24.689> indeterminate<00:01:25.380> varieties<00:01:25.490> that<00:01:26.490> are

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
year indeterminate varieties that are

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.520 
year indeterminate varieties that are
smaller<00:01:27.000> maybe<00:01:27.479> more<00:01:27.780> compact<00:01:28.229> maybe

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
smaller maybe more compact maybe

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.140 
smaller maybe more compact maybe
somebody<00:01:28.890> determinate<00:01:29.400> but<00:01:29.790> just<00:01:29.970> slow

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
somebody determinate but just slow

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.609 
somebody determinate but just slow
growers<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.780> can<00:01:30.990> grow<00:01:31.320> in<00:01:31.439> containers

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
growers that I can grow in containers

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.679 
growers that I can grow in containers
and<00:01:32.100> see<00:01:32.220> if<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.400> can<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:33.090> know<00:01:33.210> get<00:01:33.390> them<00:01:33.509> to

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
and see if I can you know get them to

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.840
