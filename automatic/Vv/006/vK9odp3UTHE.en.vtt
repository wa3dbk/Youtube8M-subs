funding the research fun during the
delivery<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.350> these<00:00:46.530> drugs<00:00:46.800> almost<00:00:47.219> half<00:00:47.460> of

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
delivery of these drugs almost half of

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.700

that's<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:48.149> generosity<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.350> United

that's the generosity of the United
States<00:00:50.030> United<00:00:51.030> States<00:00:51.480> still<00:00:51.719> has<00:00:51.960> some<00:00:52.800> of

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
States United States still has some of

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.350 
States United States still has some of
the<00:00:53.010> nades<00:00:53.280> problem<00:00:53.670> itself<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.120> it's<00:00:54.210> very

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
the nades problem itself so it's very

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.479 
the nades problem itself so it's very
fitting<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.500> experts<00:00:56.070> are<00:00:56.250> getting

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
fitting that the experts are getting

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.220 
fitting that the experts are getting
together<00:00:57.030> here<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.480> figuring<00:00:57.809> out<00:00:57.899> where<00:00:58.109> we

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
together here and figuring out where we

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.930 
together here and figuring out where we
go<00:00:58.350> now<00:00:58.530> when<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:58.949> say<00:00:58.980> some<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.550> AIDS

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
go now when you say some of the AIDS

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.490 
go now when you say some of the AIDS
probably<00:01:00.390> still<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.600> big<00:01:00.750> aids<00:01:00.930> problem<00:01:01.199> the

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
probably still a big aids problem the

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.260 
probably still a big aids problem the

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.670 
vaccine yeah the vaccine there's
excellent<00:01:23.610> scientific<00:01:24.060> progress<00:01:24.390> on<00:01:24.780> the

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
excellent scientific progress on the

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.950 
excellent scientific progress on the
understanding<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.729> how<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.030> stimulate<00:01:27.509> the

understanding of how to stimulate the

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.450 
understanding of how to stimulate the
right<00:01:28.140> response<00:01:28.409> how<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.040> make<00:01:29.250> these

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
right response how to make these

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.310 
right response how to make these
antibodies<00:01:29.960> scientists<00:01:30.960> are<00:01:31.020> doing<00:01:31.229> a

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
antibodies scientists are doing a

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.069 
antibodies scientists are doing a
wonderful<00:01:31.590> job<00:01:32.000> again<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.180> u.s.<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.840> very

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
wonderful job again the u.s. is very

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.140 
wonderful job again the u.s. is very
generous<00:01:34.320> there<00:01:34.680> but<00:01:35.250> that'll<00:01:35.579> probably<00:01:35.970> take

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
generous there but that'll probably take

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.649 
generous there but that'll probably take
a<00:01:36.329> decade<00:01:36.960> before<00:01:37.680> we<00:01:38.009> have<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.220> vaccine<00:01:38.850> all

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
a decade before we have a vaccine all

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.630 
a decade before we have a vaccine all
the<00:01:39.990> vaccine<00:01:40.409> does<00:01:40.619> it's<00:01:40.890> wonderful<00:01:41.369> but<00:01:41.490> it

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
the vaccine does it's wonderful but it

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.580 
the vaccine does it's wonderful but it
stops<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.270> from<00:01:42.299> getting<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:43.079> disease<00:01:43.380> so

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
stops you from getting the disease so

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.249 
stops you from getting the disease so
we'll<00:01:43.740> still<00:01:43.979> have<00:01:44.390> over<00:01:45.390> 30<00:01:45.630> million<00:01:45.960> people

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259
