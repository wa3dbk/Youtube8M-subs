era<00:00:05.230> with<00:00:05.410> Scott<00:00:05.740> Williamsburg<00:00:06.279> human<00:00:06.550> goes

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:06.670 
era with Scott Williamsburg human goes

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.000 
era with Scott Williamsburg human goes
later<00:00:06.850> so<00:00:07.060> you're<00:00:07.660> talking<00:00:07.840> about<00:00:07.990> nine<00:00:08.320> and

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.010 
later so you're talking about nine and

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.890 
later so you're talking about nine and
he<00:00:10.010> came<00:00:10.640> to<00:00:10.850> this<00:00:10.970> epiphany<00:00:11.450> about<00:00:11.540> the

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:11.900 
he came to this epiphany about the

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.320 
he came to this epiphany about the
nature<00:00:12.110> of<00:00:12.230> 9so<00:00:12.860> right<00:00:13.340> so<00:00:13.700> it<00:00:14.000> took<00:00:14.120> me<00:00:14.300> a

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330 
nature of 9so right so it took me a

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:15.850 
nature of 9so right so it took me a
couple<00:00:14.389> years<00:00:14.719> to<00:00:15.050> figure<00:00:15.230> out<00:00:15.350> the<00:00:15.559> purpose

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:15.860 
couple years to figure out the purpose

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.890 
couple years to figure out the purpose
that<00:00:16.520> is<00:00:16.670> served<00:00:16.970> at<00:00:17.240> first<00:00:17.450> I<00:00:17.600> thought<00:00:17.750> was

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
that is served at first I thought was

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.330 
that is served at first I thought was
just<00:00:18.020> a<00:00:18.170> cute<00:00:18.439> pad<00:00:18.680> and<00:00:18.920> I<00:00:18.980> didn't<00:00:19.189> know<00:00:19.250> what

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:19.340 
just a cute pad and I didn't know what

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.370 
just a cute pad and I didn't know what
to<00:00:19.490> do<00:00:19.640> with<00:00:19.760> it<00:00:19.910> but<00:00:20.810> then<00:00:20.960> it<00:00:21.080> hit<00:00:21.200> me

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
to do with it but then it hit me

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.250 
to do with it but then it hit me
every<00:00:22.250> number<00:00:22.430> is<00:00:22.640> a<00:00:22.730> basic<00:00:23.210> math<00:00:23.480> exercise

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:24.260 
every number is a basic math exercise

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.890 
every number is a basic math exercise
it's<00:00:24.619> a<00:00:24.740> lesson<00:00:24.980> so<00:00:25.340> 11<00:00:26.000> teaches<00:00:26.420> the<00:00:26.600> human

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
it's a lesson so 11 teaches the human

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.120 
it's a lesson so 11 teaches the human
brain<00:00:27.199> 1+1<00:00:27.940> mm-hmm<00:00:28.970> I<00:00:29.029> think<00:00:29.360> 1<00:00:29.480> plus<00:00:29.690> 1<00:00:29.900> is<00:00:30.050> 2

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
brain 1+1 mm-hmm I think 1 plus 1 is 2

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.390 
brain 1+1 mm-hmm I think 1 plus 1 is 2
now<00:00:31.130> I<00:00:31.160> can<00:00:31.430> check<00:00:31.640> it<00:00:31.850> 11<00:00:32.629> minus<00:00:32.900> 2<00:00:33.110> is<00:00:33.290> 9<00:00:33.530> if<00:00:34.220> I

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:34.400 
now I can check it 11 minus 2 is 9 if I

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.299 
now I can check it 11 minus 2 is 9 if I
get<00:00:34.610> 9<00:00:34.820> that<00:00:35.270> means<00:00:35.300> everything's<00:00:36.050> fine<00:00:36.379> so

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
get 9 that means everything's fine so

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:39.160 
get 9 that means everything's fine so
let's<00:00:37.580> try<00:00:37.760> to<00:00:37.790> make<00:00:37.970> a<00:00:38.000> mistake<00:00:38.420> I'm<00:00:38.809> trying

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
let's try to make a mistake I'm trying

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.530 
let's try to make a mistake I'm trying
to<00:00:39.230> learn<00:00:39.350> 1+1<00:00:40.160> so<00:00:40.580> I'm<00:00:40.640> starting<00:00:41.000> at<00:00:41.120> 11

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
to learn 1+1 so I'm starting at 11

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.470 
to learn 1+1 so I'm starting at 11
mm-hmm<00:00:42.050> I<00:00:42.079> think<00:00:42.410> 1<00:00:42.559> plus<00:00:42.770> 1<00:00:42.980> is<00:00:43.130> 3<00:00:43.460> let's<00:00:44.270> plug

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
mm-hmm I think 1 plus 1 is 3 let's plug

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.100 
mm-hmm I think 1 plus 1 is 3 let's plug
it<00:00:44.630> in<00:00:44.750> 11<00:00:45.410> minus<00:00:45.739> 3<00:00:45.770> is<00:00:46.250> 8<00:00:47.059> it's<00:00:47.270> not<00:00:47.480> 9<00:00:47.750> so<00:00:48.020> it

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
it in 11 minus 3 is 8 it's not 9 so it

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.500 
it in 11 minus 3 is 8 it's not 9 so it
tells<00:00:48.350> me<00:00:48.500> that<00:00:48.620> something<00:00:48.920> is<00:00:49.219> wrong<00:00:49.520> every

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
tells me that something is wrong every

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.709 
tells me that something is wrong every
number<00:00:50.719> has<00:00:50.930> to<00:00:51.350> go<00:00:51.440> back<00:00:51.620> to<00:00:51.770> 9<00:00:51.969> or<00:00:52.969> something

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
number has to go back to 9 or something

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:55.510 
number has to go back to 9 or something
is<00:00:53.840> wrong<00:00:54.050> so<00:00:54.320> it's<00:00:54.680> a<00:00:54.710> great<00:00:54.890> way<00:00:55.040> of<00:00:55.070> checking

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
is wrong so it's a great way of checking

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.310 
is wrong so it's a great way of checking
your<00:00:55.879> work<00:00:55.969> exactly<00:00:56.540> if<00:00:56.809> you<00:00:56.899> want<00:00:57.050> to<00:00:57.110> learn

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
your work exactly if you want to learn

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.979 
your work exactly if you want to learn
2+2<00:00:57.940> just<00:00:58.940> start<00:00:59.149> at<00:00:59.270> 22

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
2+2 just start at 22

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.319 
2+2 just start at 22
you<00:01:00.590> think<00:01:00.829> it's<00:01:00.980> four<00:01:01.280> but<00:01:01.670> now<00:01:01.850> we<00:01:01.910> can<00:01:02.120> check

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
you think it's four but now we can check

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.859 
you think it's four but now we can check
it<00:01:02.539> because<00:01:02.629> 22<00:01:03.260> minus<00:01:03.559> 4<00:01:03.860> is<00:01:04.129> 18<00:01:05.030> or<00:01:05.180> adds<00:01:05.690> up

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
it because 22 minus 4 is 18 or adds up

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:08.469 
it because 22 minus 4 is 18 or adds up
to<00:01:05.899> 9<00:01:06.200> so<00:01:06.680> I<00:01:06.740> asked<00:01:07.190> fine<00:01:07.430> this<00:01:08.090> works<00:01:08.330> for

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
to 9 so I asked fine this works for

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.020 
to 9 so I asked fine this works for
every<00:01:08.690> number<00:01:08.810> to<00:01:09.110> infinity<00:01:09.740> what<00:01:10.610> it<00:01:10.700> will<00:01:10.820> do

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
every number to infinity what it will do

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.090 
every number to infinity what it will do
is<00:01:11.180> if<00:01:11.300> I<00:01:11.420> can<00:01:11.630> teach<00:01:11.810> every<00:01:12.140> kid<00:01:12.410> on<00:01:12.530> a<00:01:12.560> planet

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
is if I can teach every kid on a planet

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.809 
is if I can teach every kid on a planet
that's<00:01:13.130> 8<00:01:13.580> years<00:01:13.880> old<00:01:14.119> when<00:01:15.080> they're<00:01:15.259> 9<00:01:15.819> every

00:01:16.809 --> 00:01:16.819 
that's 8 years old when they're 9 every

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:19.059 
that's 8 years old when they're 9 every
number<00:01:17.030> in<00:01:17.209> our<00:01:17.330> plan<00:01:17.630> on<00:01:17.869> our<00:01:17.990> planet<00:01:18.289> will<00:01:18.950> go

00:01:19.059 --> 00:01:19.069 
number in our plan on our planet will go

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:21.370 
number in our plan on our planet will go
back<00:01:19.310> to<00:01:19.340> their<00:01:19.610> age<00:01:19.910> number<00:01:20.539> 9<00:01:20.750> so<00:01:21.020> when<00:01:21.140> a<00:01:21.170> kid

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
back to their age number 9 so when a kid

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.980 
back to their age number 9 so when a kid
sees<00:01:21.619> a<00:01:21.649> speed<00:01:21.979> of<00:01:22.130> a<00:01:22.190> site<00:01:22.399> for<00:01:22.580> 55<00:01:23.209> they're

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
sees a speed of a site for 55 they're

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.650 
sees a speed of a site for 55 they're

it<00:01:45.740> chapter<00:01:45.979> zero<00:01:46.490> I<00:01:46.759> think<00:01:47.060> it's<00:01:47.179> the<00:01:47.270> missing

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
it chapter zero I think it's the missing

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.779 
it chapter zero I think it's the missing
chapter<00:01:47.869> in<00:01:48.380> math<00:01:48.800> if<00:01:49.039> all<00:01:49.220> kids<00:01:49.490> would<00:01:49.640> learn

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
chapter in math if all kids would learn

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.990 
chapter in math if all kids would learn
this<00:01:50.030> first<00:01:50.530> then<00:01:51.530> we<00:01:52.340> could<00:01:52.520> teach<00:01:52.670> him<00:01:52.819> that

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
this first then we could teach him that

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.370 
this first then we could teach him that
well<00:01:53.300> right<00:01:53.420> now<00:01:53.569> they<00:01:53.690> just<00:01:53.750> memorize<00:01:54.200> some

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
well right now they just memorize some

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.570 
well right now they just memorize some

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
algebra he gets ugly I'm sure you've
thought<00:01:57.170> about<00:01:57.470> the<00:01:57.560> implications<00:01:58.039> for

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
thought about the implications for

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.130 
thought about the implications for
baseball

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140

paper on it there's nothing things about
the<00:02:03.739> number<00:02:03.920> 9<00:02:04.069> in<00:02:04.220> baseball<00:02:04.810> so<00:02:05.810> now<00:02:06.349> here's

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
the number 9 in baseball so now here's

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:07.749 
the number 9 in baseball so now here's
what's<00:02:06.679> crazy<00:02:06.830> I<00:02:07.099> haven't<00:02:07.310> really<00:02:07.520> shared

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
what's crazy I haven't really shared

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.100 
what's crazy I haven't really shared
this<00:02:07.910> much<00:02:08.119> with<00:02:08.300> anybody<00:02:08.630> but<00:02:08.750> I<00:02:08.810> will<00:02:08.989> with

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
this much with anybody but I will with

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:09.729 
this much with anybody but I will with
you<00:02:09.319> all<00:02:09.530> right

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
you all right

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.130 
you all right
look<00:02:10.459> at<00:02:10.580> 123<00:02:11.180> I'm<00:02:11.300> seeing<00:02:11.599> add<00:02:11.780> up<00:02:11.900> all<00:02:12.050> the

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
look at 123 I'm seeing add up all the

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.990 
look at 123 I'm seeing add up all the
digits<00:02:12.349> one<00:02:12.739> plus<00:02:12.980> two<00:02:13.160> plus<00:02:13.190> three<00:02:13.430> is<00:02:13.730> six

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
digits one plus two plus three is six

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.670 
digits one plus two plus three is six
put<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:14.450> tol<00:02:14.660> underneath<00:02:15.020> and<00:02:15.200> subtract<00:02:15.560> you

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
put the tol underneath and subtract you

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.300 
put the tol underneath and subtract you
get<00:02:15.770> 117<00:02:16.610> your<00:02:16.969> answer<00:02:17.269> 1<00:02:17.480> 1<00:02:17.659> 7<00:02:18.019> is<00:02:18.110> 9<00:02:18.290> but<00:02:19.159> what

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
get 117 your answer 1 1 7 is 9 but what

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.400 
get 117 your answer 1 1 7 is 9 but what
I<00:02:19.340> noticed<00:02:19.670> afterwards

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
I noticed afterwards

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.800 
I noticed afterwards
this<00:02:20.620> let's<00:02:21.130> take<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.400> same<00:02:21.580> number<00:02:21.640> 123<00:02:22.630> but

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
this let's take the same number 123 but

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.930 
this let's take the same number 123 but
this<00:02:22.960> time<00:02:23.200> instead<00:02:24.130> of<00:02:24.310> adding<00:02:24.460> up<00:02:24.640> all<00:02:24.790> the

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
this time instead of adding up all the

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.760 
this time instead of adding up all the
digits<00:02:25.300> let's<00:02:25.510> just<00:02:25.660> add<00:02:25.810> up<00:02:26.020> a<00:02:26.200> couple<00:02:26.680> of

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
digits let's just add up a couple of

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.200 
digits let's just add up a couple of
them<00:02:26.890> so<00:02:27.040> let's<00:02:27.190> put<00:02:27.340> a<00:02:27.370> plus<00:02:27.580> sign<00:02:27.610> here<00:02:27.850> now

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
them so let's put a plus sign here now

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.740 
them so let's put a plus sign here now
we've<00:02:28.390> created<00:02:28.600> 12<00:02:29.200> plus<00:02:29.710> 3<00:02:30.010> well<00:02:30.880> 12<00:02:31.240> plus<00:02:31.510> 3

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
we've created 12 plus 3 well 12 plus 3

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.020 
we've created 12 plus 3 well 12 plus 3
is<00:02:31.840> 15

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
is 15

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.900 
is 15
123<00:02:34.030> -15<00:02:34.780> gives<00:02:35.230> me<00:02:35.470> 108<00:02:36.310> and<00:02:36.520> look<00:02:36.670> at<00:02:36.790> my

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
123 -15 gives me 108 and look at my

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.990 
123 -15 gives me 108 and look at my
answer<00:02:37.180> 1<00:02:37.390> 0<00:02:37.660> &amp;<00:02:37.840> 8<00:02:37.960> is<00:02:38.170> 9<00:02:38.590> you<00:02:39.490> can<00:02:39.520> break<00:02:39.790> it<00:02:39.910> up

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
answer 1 0 &amp; 8 is 9 you can break it up

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.700 
answer 1 0 &amp; 8 is 9 you can break it up
any<00:02:40.180> way<00:02:40.270> you<00:02:40.390> want<00:02:40.540> it'll<00:02:40.990> always<00:02:41.170> work<00:02:41.470> let's
