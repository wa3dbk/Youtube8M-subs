see<00:01:12.119> here<00:01:15.650> yes<00:01:16.650> that's<00:01:16.979> obvious<00:01:17.130> because<00:01:17.460> we

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
see here yes that's obvious because we

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.149 
see here yes that's obvious because we
have<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.150> five<00:01:18.600> megapixel<00:01:18.780> camera<00:01:19.229> on<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.799> back

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.450 
have a five megapixel camera on the back
when<00:01:21.150> compared<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.780> VGA<00:01:21.990> so<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:23.250> wave

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
when compared to the VGA so that wave

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.950 
when compared to the VGA so that wave
but<00:01:23.700> normally<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.150> person<00:01:24.330> would<00:01:24.479> obviously

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
but normally a person would obviously

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.109 
but normally a person would obviously
use<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.320> front<00:01:25.590> camera<00:01:25.830> so<00:01:26.310> let<00:01:26.700> me<00:01:26.880> switch

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
use the front camera so let me switch

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.819
