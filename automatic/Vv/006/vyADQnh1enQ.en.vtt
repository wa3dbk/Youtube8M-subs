of spurred because I've recently ran
into<00:02:19.680> some<00:02:20.099> techniques<00:02:20.519> that<00:02:20.670> have<00:02:20.760> worked

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
into some techniques that have worked

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.750 
into some techniques that have worked
pretty<00:02:21.180> well<00:02:21.360> for<00:02:21.420> me<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:22.620> I'm<00:02:23.220> also<00:02:23.400> on<00:02:23.549> the

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
know to see how just a few techniques

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.830 
know to see how just a few techniques
can<00:02:28.890> help<00:02:28.950> me<00:02:29.370> on<00:02:29.670> my<00:02:29.700> defensive<00:02:30.360> edge<00:02:30.540> and

you're<00:02:42.659> really<00:02:42.840> going<00:02:43.019> to<00:02:43.079> be<00:02:43.230> able<00:02:43.290> to<00:02:43.500> apply

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
you're really going to be able to apply

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.759 
you're really going to be able to apply
that<00:02:44.239> much<00:02:45.239> more<00:02:45.450> effectively<00:02:45.900> so<00:02:46.170> I'm<00:02:46.590> really

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
what is what are those techniques what

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.670 
what is what are those techniques what
is<00:02:55.500> that<00:02:55.739> mindset<00:02:56.190> what<00:02:56.519> is<00:02:57.379> the<00:02:58.379> kind<00:02:58.620> of
