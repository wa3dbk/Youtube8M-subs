home button go over to cydia and let's

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.479 
home button go over to cydia and let's
just<00:00:54.750> full<00:00:55.050> screen<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.469> again<00:00:55.739> so<00:00:56.129> this<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.340> by

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489

demo<00:01:33.689> let's<00:01:33.990> just<00:01:34.170> go<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.409> home<00:01:34.560> screen<00:01:34.890> and

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
demo let's just go the home screen and

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.609 
demo let's just go the home screen and
we'll<00:01:36.150> go<00:01:36.299> ahead<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.570> get<00:01:37.020> rid<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.290> all<00:01:37.500> these

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
we'll go ahead and get rid of all these

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.620 
we'll go ahead and get rid of all these
applications<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.610> we'll<00:01:39.030> just<00:01:39.240> start<00:01:39.450> from

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
applications and we'll just start from

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.889 
applications and we'll just start from
fresh<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:40.920> let's<00:01:41.189> say<00:01:41.369> we<00:01:41.520> want<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.850> let's<00:01:42.750> just

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
fresh so let's say we want to let's just

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.050 
fresh so let's say we want to let's just
put<00:01:43.079> this<00:01:43.110> in<00:01:43.350> landscape<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.100> let's<00:01:44.700> do<00:01:44.880> an

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
put this in landscape and let's do an

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.170 
put this in landscape and let's do an
actual<00:01:45.570> real-life<00:01:46.290> situation<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:47.820> let's<00:01:48.030> say

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
actual real-life situation so let's say

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.990 
actual real-life situation so let's say
you<00:01:48.210> need<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.659> take<00:01:48.960> notes<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.820> need<00:01:50.820> to

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
you need to take notes and you need to

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.249 
you need to take notes and you need to
use<00:01:51.299> let's<00:01:52.290> just<00:01:52.350> say<00:01:52.530> Safari<00:01:53.990> so<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.049> need

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
use let's just say Safari so you need

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.310 
use let's just say Safari so you need
Safari<00:01:55.680> right<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:57.329> need<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.630> be<00:01:57.869> looking<00:01:58.079> up

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
Safari right you need to be looking up

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.440 
Safari right you need to be looking up
information<00:01:58.729> sometimes<00:01:59.729> you<00:01:59.850> have<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.090> rotate

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
information sometimes you have to rotate

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.330 
information sometimes you have to rotate
around<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.439> say<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:01.680> need<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.250> be

googling<00:02:02.880> information<00:02:03.719> on<00:02:03.840> Safari<00:02:04.259> so<00:02:05.100> we

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
googling information on Safari so we

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.059 
googling information on Safari so we
just<00:02:06.030> go<00:02:06.180> like<00:02:06.329> that<00:02:07.459> we'll<00:02:08.459> go<00:02:08.610> over<00:02:08.640> here<00:02:09.119> to

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
just go like that we'll go over here to

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.860 
just go like that we'll go over here to
low<00:02:11.069> go<00:02:11.340> ahead<00:02:11.520> and<00:02:11.670> load<00:02:11.790> up<00:02:11.849> Google<00:02:12.300> then<00:02:12.780> we

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
low go ahead and load up Google then we

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.960 
low go ahead and load up Google then we
just<00:02:13.050> go<00:02:13.170> hit<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.530> home<00:02:13.650> button

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
just go hit the home button

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.360 
just go hit the home button

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
the other thing is you can also go ahead

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.170 
the other thing is you can also go ahead
and<00:03:00.260> open<00:03:00.410> up<00:03:00.650> multiple<00:03:01.190> applications<00:03:02.060> just

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
and open up multiple applications just

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.440 
and open up multiple applications just
like<00:03:02.570> this<00:03:02.780> so<00:03:03.410> rotate<00:03:03.830> around<00:03:04.010> again<00:03:04.610> and<00:03:04.820> go

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
like this so rotate around again and go

like this so rotate around again and go
ahead<00:03:05.690> and<00:03:05.900> move<00:03:06.050> these<00:03:06.230> things<00:03:06.500> all<00:03:06.650> around

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
ahead and move these things all around

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.920 
ahead and move these things all around
we<00:03:07.070> can<00:03:07.190> adjust<00:03:07.520> the<00:03:07.730> size<00:03:08.000> so<00:03:08.690> we<00:03:08.750> can<00:03:08.870> go

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
we can adjust the size so we can go

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.540 
we can adjust the size so we can go
ahead<00:03:09.020> and<00:03:09.140> set<00:03:09.410> this<00:03:09.440> one<00:03:09.740> really<00:03:10.010> big<00:03:10.280> and

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
ahead and set this one really big and

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.610 
ahead and set this one really big and
then<00:03:11.030> have<00:03:11.209> this<00:03:11.360> one<00:03:11.540> off<00:03:11.660> to<00:03:11.810> the<00:03:11.900> side<00:03:12.140> so

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
then have this one off to the side so

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:13.870 
then have this one off to the side so
it's<00:03:12.740> really<00:03:12.920> nice<00:03:13.130> that<00:03:13.190> you<00:03:13.430> can<00:03:13.520> do<00:03:13.640> all

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
applications so I'm just going to do one
