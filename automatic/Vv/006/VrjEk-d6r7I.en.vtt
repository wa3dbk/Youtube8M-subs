00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
the sleep forces you can the trick where

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.840 
the sleep forces you can the trick where
yourself<00:01:08.820> say<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.720> top<00:01:09.990> card<00:01:10.290> echo<00:01:11.189> dimes<00:01:11.460> and

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
yourself say the top card echo dimes and

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.109 
yourself say the top card echo dimes and
you<00:01:12.210> don't<00:01:12.470> you're<00:01:13.470> gonna<00:01:13.560> really<00:01:14.460> get<00:01:15.060> a
