 Hmm 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:01.329
 Hmm 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.060
 Justice surfboard silk carol shape from 2013 new model 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.560
 release 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:16.850
 The category is Orlando series model name is 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:21.289
 Orlando series proposed by Justice is a Japanese beach brief 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:26.960
 Or even the reef de break can show its performance firmly 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:32.909
 A so-called all-in-one universal model from this hole proposal and waves of the knee hips to head over 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:38.670
 We will make full use of its performance with fine sizing according to each level you follow 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:43.380
 Outline has become a sharp outline over from nose to tail 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:48.760
 Taxes and charts are charted to enable a sharper approach 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:51.850
 The tail area is Yes narrow down in order to improve the nimble action rotation of 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.320
 Sled important for surfboard performance 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.900
 The locker is 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:02.420
 It is finished with an overall natural card 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:06.210
 Concave, which is another important factor in surfboard performance, is single to double 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:09.569
 And it is processed with v conave in the tail end 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:13.990
 As in the normal Orlando model 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:19.810
 We use this Arou model in the size of about 5 eleven 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:21.300
 This Carroll 2013 model tests on the concept of all-in-one model 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:27.050
 Started 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:29.650
 Easy to ride in Japan's typical low-impact wave Good control performance 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.980
 Soft ripak ride 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:37.980
 Dahn stretches vertically rather than horizontally 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:41.660
 It is possible to make an action on a section of the card in sharp corner 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:47.720
 By the v- concave process assigned to the end 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:49.790
 I felt that the speed of curling and turning is interesting and I felt unique flow of water 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.269
 I think it will be 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:56.460
 At the end of the turn , the bale is also good 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:03:01.440
 Performance property was completed in high model 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:05.500
 Competitors and performance who are required to perform in various conditions 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.520
 It is a recommended model by all means for the person of importance 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.480
