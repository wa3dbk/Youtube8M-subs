 If the lotion is not a style lotion

 Well, it was just the right type of skin tiles and then a few days ago 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:31.119
 I got introduced to the US in the coming one week ago, once again writing what products 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:37.420
 I tried to use it. 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:39.910

 First, the smell is really hopping miok deoraguyo many a little subungam Keeper 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:54.910
 I have acne, but dry skin, so it takes a little bit of time to use any product 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:59.679
 There was a feeling of drying up or a lack of it. 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:01.239
 In the morning, if you wear these products , 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:06.430
 I get up very quickly. 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:07.930
 In the morning, if you apply before cremation, 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:13.180
 It worked. 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:19.149
 I'm going to show you these products in front of me. 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:22.340
 Especially cream flavors are really good formulation Let's just scented bareuja 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:27.530
 That's what I like about wheat. 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:32.960
 Oh, and I do not have sun cream. My friends are like this. 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:36.950
 If your friends who are interested in your skin are scared and do not use sun cream, 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:42.020
 Noah asked me to use a sun cream to make it, but as I said before, 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:46.670
 I have acne face when I make a rubbing skin cream write because so 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:49.250
 I have been using sunscreen for some time because of the feeling like it's getting thicker and something like acne . 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:54.890
 This product is not've already Innovation 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:56.239
 You smile. Something cloudy. Something that turns white and gray. 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.989
 There was no. 

00:01:56.239 --> 00:02:02.049
 I'll show you if I can not get the low noise circle. 

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:02.049
 uh 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:08.549
 So just look this way, do not pay a sunscreen went as sunscreen 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:19.690
 When you press it like this is just a real generic cream-like feeling at all 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.020
 I do not have the impression that it's irritating or acne-like. 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:26.120
 moist 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:31.340
 This sunscreen is usually slightly to give Joe a sunscreen do so 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:36.500
 I feel that I feel a little whitish and I feel a little bit of creamy bikini I think 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:42.290
 But I had miok cream is different but not all sunscreens are so 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:46.220
 I do not need to do that, 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:48.310
 Feel free to apply it to men even if it is right. 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.310
 Yes 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.709
 Then ah, then I'll just go this two kinds of cream, I really HOT! 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:02.579
 I have. 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:06.180
 The username wo cream x Aquaplus 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:09.510
 Uh - oh, there's Aqua Submarine Cream. 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.550
 I'll show you once. 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.970
 If you look at me 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:19.350
 So this is really unusual. 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:24.870
 If you look at Aqua Plus Cream, it's not like Yoplait. 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:27.060
 Yoplait think is more miraculous feeling like No. 2 fillets sprinkle when you opened my 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:32.100
 It turns into water . 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:33.960
 I do not think I should turn this thing on my face because it turned into water. 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:38.520
 Immediate absorption 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:40.470
 Just like I thought, I do not just feel it on the outside . 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:45.540
 I rubbed it on my hands. 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:51.390
 It 's cool, it 's cool, it 's cool, it 's cool, it turns into water. 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:53.010
 This water feels so I do not know just because some electrolyte turns water line 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:58.980
 There was no strain on the skin. 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:04:04.680
 Even before bedtime at night, the moisture lasts until morning, 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:06.810
 I'm such a product would you give me just like this one that is who preferred to talk 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:12.690
 And this product 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:18.359
 As I said before, this is also a little bit more than this. 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:22.800
 This is also good for the scent . 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:24.030
 So, first of all, the seaweed products are generally moist and moist. 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.710
 It's a lot. 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:32.820
 I am as dry as I am and I do not like feeling so fat and acne 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:38.550
 Who is considered the rainy season yijeongmi jegyeok 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:43.710
 In addition, it is moist, but there is a lot of moisture, 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:47.280
 You can see these products in this dosage form. 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:50.580
 So then these two things 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:55.590
 Well, it's nice to have a good night's sleep. 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:05:01.350
 d-8 dp knit Renewal Overnight program two skins and lotions 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:03.600
 If you look to the essence as I said, there is first ahkkado miok products are fragrance 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:08.640
 I love it. 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:10.800
 After I rubbed it, when I lay down and close the eyes, 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:14.730
 Do I have to say I am more sleeping ? 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:20.520
 And in the morning, if you do this, 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:23.880
 The bottom is also moist and lasting, so this and this formula is just plain 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:28.050
 That kind of recruitment that you can think of is a little jelly. 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:33.390
 It's like jelly.It's like sticking to jelly. 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:37.590
 Apply directly to the film look is to change the water like this also earlier said cream 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:41.490
 So it is very easy to hold on to your face. 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:46.020
 Oh, I think you're going to get better with your hands today . 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:52.080
 I showed you this kind of thing, and the last time Asuka was a little sad, 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:57.300
 I do not just write mist in this way , 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:06:01.950
 If you have a librarian, you can usually write a mist mistake like this 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:05.790
 And there is just enough water to fill a list that this is just written 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:08.790
 It says only 24 hours in Aqua. 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:12.150
 I'll sprinkle it once . 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:17.640
 If you look, you feel like you're being sprayed. 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:18.360
 Out a lot of sheep small amount Lots President wieda never you will not 

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:23.580
 Equal 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:28.380
 I usually come to the lotion immediately, and there are a lot of things to go around in the garden. 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:29.280
 And miok these products smell good this is that with a little more flavor 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:34.710
 Should 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:40.110
 But little good if the product itself is indeed not only do good to sow twice 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:44.070
 When I sprayed it and it came out to be crowded , when I sprayed it on my face, 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:46.470
 It's not just discard it heunggeon not gonna be excited slightly moist and give the roots 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:52.530
 This was a little disappointing. 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:55.470
 So this is a little bit of scent. 

00:06:52.530 --> 00:07:00.630
 There was a bit of an overachievement 

00:06:55.470 --> 00:07:05.010
 This is what I felt while writing this product 

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:09.360
 It 's not that much promoted product. 

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:14.010
 Nevertheless, when I wrote it, I knew this good thing. 

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:19.410
 I want this so willing to introduce you to a lot of people again, especially cream 

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:24.660
 Both of these remaining products are really doing something good might even third-party products 

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:28.860
 Maybe, but these two really make my dryness last a long time. 

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:30.240
 I can not believe you gave it to me, 

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:34.230
 I hope you see 

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:35.010
 If there are any products that are still being updated, 

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:40.490
 Because it is. 

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:40.490
 You might want to look at the things in front and try it out.
