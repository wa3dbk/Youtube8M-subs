like I'm sorry guys it looks like it's
really<00:01:43.020> like<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.409> think<00:01:43.470> that<00:01:43.860> face<00:01:44.100> coke<00:01:44.369> is

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
really like I think that face coke is

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.690 
really like I think that face coke is
very<00:01:44.729> cool<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.180> paint<00:01:45.420> works<00:01:45.689> nice<00:01:46.520> like<00:01:47.520> his

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
very cool the paint works nice like his

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.240 
very cool the paint works nice like his
eyes<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:47.909> think<00:01:48.210> they<00:01:48.360> glowed<00:01:48.600> nicely<00:01:49.079> but<00:01:50.040> then

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
eyes I think they glowed nicely but then

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.130 
eyes I think they glowed nicely but then
I<00:01:50.430> think<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.729> figures<00:01:51.119> does<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.600> lack<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.840> bit

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
I think the figures does to lack a bit

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.990 
I think the figures does to lack a bit
it<00:01:52.619> gets<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.829> bit<00:01:52.979> boring<00:01:53.009> there's<00:01:53.610> not<00:01:53.790> much

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
it gets a bit boring there's not much

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.510 
it gets a bit boring there's not much
detail<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:55.530> him

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.990 

just<00:01:59.520> sort<00:01:59.909> of<00:02:00.500> it<00:02:01.500> just<00:02:01.680> didn't<00:02:02.460> excite<00:02:02.759> me

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
just sort of it just didn't excite me

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.780 
just sort of it just didn't excite me
when<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.329> open<00:02:03.840> him<00:02:03.990> up<00:02:04.130> the<00:02:05.130> best<00:02:05.369> part<00:02:05.700> about

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
his head obviously does move around

this one

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.369 
this one
a<00:03:20.060> little<00:03:21.060> bit<00:03:21.150> of<00:03:21.239> movement<00:03:21.359> there<00:03:21.720> but<00:03:22.019> very

I<00:03:25.639> didn't<00:03:26.639> bother<00:03:26.760> taking<00:03:27.440> lady<00:03:28.440> death<00:03:28.769> out

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
I didn't bother taking lady death out

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:30.860 
I didn't bother taking lady death out
because<00:03:29.639> she<00:03:29.790> does<00:03:29.970> have<00:03:30.239> she<00:03:30.569> has<00:03:30.690> no

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
because she does have she has no

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.559 
because she does have she has no
articulation<00:03:31.530> at<00:03:31.709> all<00:03:32.069> she<00:03:32.909> has<00:03:33.030> a<00:03:33.060> mass<00:03:33.299> that

articulation at all she has a mass that

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.629 
articulation at all she has a mass that
comes<00:03:33.810> that<00:03:33.959> you<00:03:34.049> could<00:03:34.169> put<00:03:34.379> on<00:03:34.409> her<00:03:34.739> but

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
comes that you could put on her but

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:37.670 
comes that you could put on her but
she's<00:03:36.060> just<00:03:36.090> a<00:03:36.329> statue<00:03:36.599> so<00:03:36.780> it<00:03:37.260> didn't<00:03:37.620> really

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
she's just a statue so it didn't really

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.140 
she's just a statue so it didn't really
excite<00:03:38.129> me<00:03:38.159> to<00:03:39.139> to<00:03:40.139> take<00:03:40.319> care<00:03:40.560> of<00:03:40.590> out<00:03:41.150> anyway

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
excite me to to take care of out anyway

excite me to to take care of out anyway
the<00:03:42.269> best<00:03:42.449> part<00:03:42.720> about<00:03:42.780> his<00:03:43.019> guy<00:03:43.229> is<00:03:43.709> obviously

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
the best part about his guy is obviously

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:46.670 
the best part about his guy is obviously
his<00:03:44.400> head<00:03:44.609> face<00:03:44.849> and<00:03:44.879> his<00:03:45.329> sculpt<00:03:45.720> but<00:03:46.500> I<00:03:46.530> was

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
his head face and his sculpt but I was

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.149 
his head face and his sculpt but I was
quite<00:03:46.859> disappointed<00:03:47.489> in<00:03:47.609> him<00:03:47.729> to<00:03:47.940> be<00:03:48.030> honest

00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:49.159 
quite disappointed in him to be honest

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:51.710

if<00:03:50.159> I'm<00:03:50.370> gonna<00:03:50.489> have<00:03:50.729> a<00:03:51.000> figure<00:03:51.299> that<00:03:51.540> just

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
if I'm gonna have a figure that just

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.869 
if I'm gonna have a figure that just
stands<00:03:51.959> there<00:03:52.109> I<00:03:52.470> would<00:03:52.769> prefer<00:03:53.010> to<00:03:53.190> have<00:03:53.549> a

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 
stands there I would prefer to have a

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:56.599 
stands there I would prefer to have a
lot<00:03:54.449> of<00:03:54.569> paint<00:03:54.810> application<00:03:55.500> and<00:03:55.709> less

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
lot of paint application and less

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:00.800 
lot of paint application and less
articulation<00:03:57.540> to<00:03:57.690> me<00:03:59.120> he<00:04:00.120> doesn't<00:04:00.299> have<00:04:00.659> much

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
articulation to me he doesn't have much

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.240 
articulation to me he doesn't have much
detail<00:04:01.519> so<00:04:02.519> sort<00:04:03.180> of<00:04:03.239> sculpted<00:04:03.690> muscle<00:04:04.250> so

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
detail so sort of sculpted muscle so

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.879 
detail so sort of sculpted muscle so
very<00:04:07.220> simple<00:04:08.930> I'm<00:04:09.930> not<00:04:10.109> sure<00:04:10.319> if<00:04:10.500> he's<00:04:10.650> worth

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889 
very simple I'm not sure if he's worth

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:14.149 
very simple I'm not sure if he's worth
the<00:04:11.250> three<00:04:11.609> dollars<00:04:12.349> anyway<00:04:13.349> that's<00:04:14.040> the

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:14.159 
the three dollars anyway that's the

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:16.159 
the three dollars anyway that's the
thing<00:04:14.310> else<00:04:14.459> so<00:04:15.150> you<00:04:15.209> guys<00:04:15.479> will<00:04:15.690> love<00:04:15.810> him<00:04:15.959> and

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
thing else so you guys will love him and

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:21.920 
thing else so you guys will love him and
that's<00:04:16.590> cool<00:04:19.099> I'm<00:04:20.239> slowly<00:04:21.239> going<00:04:21.449> into<00:04:21.690> marble

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
that's cool I'm slowly going into marble

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.800 
that's cool I'm slowly going into marble
but<00:04:22.380> I<00:04:22.590> really<00:04:23.010> think<00:04:23.159> the<00:04:23.550> gambit<00:04:23.940> figure<00:04:24.270> was

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
but I really think the gambit figure was

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.660 
but I really think the gambit figure was
a<00:04:24.840> lot<00:04:25.050> better

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
a lot better

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:32.590 
a lot better
this<00:04:27.210> guy<00:04:27.480> yes<00:04:28.290> lets<00:04:28.650> me<00:04:28.830> lift<00:04:29.400> me<00:04:29.580> a<00:04:29.790> bit<00:04:30.750> there

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
this guy yes lets me lift me a bit there

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.650 
this guy yes lets me lift me a bit there
so<00:04:33.600> this<00:04:34.350> is<00:04:34.500> another<00:04:34.710> tech<00:04:34.950> solution<00:04:35.250> review
