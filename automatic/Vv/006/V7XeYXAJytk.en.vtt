00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:11.210
 what goes scary is a bit special because 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.200
 that he has particular shapes and he has 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.420
 been developed by an engineer 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.640
 chemist's name would make it look 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.850
 departure who understood that the steam 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.970
 and el ahrach cooking that allow 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.130
 keep the nutritional principles while 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.970
 eliminating toxins 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.380
 but he realized that 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.010
 classic couscous makers had stuff 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.500
 too small so he developed 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.030
 holes big enough for the 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.510
 steam always regulates itself below 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.510
 100 degrees 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.630
 2 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.410
 we 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.970
 or 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.630
 it's true that 30 years ago the steam 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.340
 it was the pressure cooker art I'm going 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:59.250
 it's the death of the cocotte it's the 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.530
 sweet steam that's the ideal it's 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.590
 demonstrate nutritional qualities 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.450
 you do not lose I would say the taste of 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.170
 food and at the same time the value 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.720
 nutritional 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.130
 but our body asks us that it is 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.230
 vital for the brain for the rhinus for 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.030
 the liver for all organs during the 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.100
 sweet steaming 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.140
 they must invade the states 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.140
 united europe and asia 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:31.700
 André black eye was a press kit 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:33.170
 monumental on patents he had 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.119
 acquired in all areas of the 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.439
 science but one day his wife tells him you 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.590
 do things for others and nothing 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:41.899
 for me so he had some cash and has 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.549
 decided to go around the world for 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.960
 to see how we cooked 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.539
 food because that was the point 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.820
 key he had highlighted and 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:52.009
 it's from there that he created are 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.710
 vital isr who became the vital isr 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.539
 I understood that cooking 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.220
 was important and thanks to andré 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:59.780
 who had conceived already has a 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.600
 first steam tube he called it the 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.189
 vapo vapor hockey ok and then I 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.600
 left with his hat keserü arm 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:06.530
 so I did hours and hours 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.720
 of the kitchen 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.849
 so this meeting with andré coquard 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.099
 was very important to me if 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:15.440
 important that finally we decided to 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.720
 associate create a society so at the 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.370
 initially I sold his camera but his 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.370
 device for me was not completed 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.310
 there are still biology waves that 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.020
 had vibratory in the food there is 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.090
 something alive and I have 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.750
 worked on the golden ratio and the 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.210
 shape waves 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.860
 so I 'm doing them slightly evolved into 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.600
 working the holes slightly more 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.480
 big than what caracas donated 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.700
 106 mm for the big and the small because 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.770
 that there is a question of how many gold that 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.470
 must adjust to these settings 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:52.380
 so that's the the diameter of the holes 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.940
 numerous distribution and the lid to 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.340
 a shame of form also that I studied 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.690
 with Olympic games and so with 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.210
 the antenna of leychert it was necessary that it 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.010
 responds to 18.6 so that the court does not 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.560
 did not answer 18.6 it was not the right one 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.170
 and the jelly really lock the 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.750
 hole diameter the hole name the 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.700
 distribution according to the diameter but 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.460
 also the proportions between the pot 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.760
 the sieve and the lid I had some 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:21.000
 very very cruel radiesthesists with me 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:24.420
 and we'll see if it works and it 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.090
 walk because we go back the vibration 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.430
 of the food that has more vitality 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.660
 after cooking that before an egg comes out 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.880
 from the refrigerator 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.880
 the vibration is really very low 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.620
 you put it twenty seconds into the 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.720
 vital isr 20 seconds 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.050
 you take out your egg and you 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.000
 measure it is mounted there is the antenna of 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.460
 graduated antenna species circles 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.070
 and with this antenna can be graduated the 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.310
 wavelength and well length 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.790
 wave most 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:57.190
 formidable was said 7.661 handed a 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.800
 food or anything meets that 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.720
 17.6 there we can say not only it's 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.450
 consistent with the living but more 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.700
 will enhance the vibratory rate of 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.670
 alive who is in contact with him and 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.069
 so it's tough up to 17.6 amazing 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.709
 the only thing we did not manage to 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:17.620
 to raise to 17.6 it was livers of 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:21.609
 commercial poultry yielded 0 and after 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:23.080
 Steam 0 incredible but otherwise we arrive 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.330
 even a carrot that is average 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.639
 quality we have it but a minute to the 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.410
 steam she's not cooked did 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:32.710
 to raise its vibratory rate 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:35.020
 so I think lon of form the number 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.550
 of gold must work on coherence 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.020
 cellular because we can not do everything 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.160
 explain we can only measure 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.160
 we do not explain everything 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.340
 2 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.310
 it's so simple cooking at the 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.500
 sweet steam to what we sort more 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.390
 quick to this role with a pan on 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.770
 cook everything and throw the water that contains 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.540
 all the pesticides every 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.850
 junk all grades on charles 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:00.400
 who will not go through filtered 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.050
 through your digestive tract and who will you 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.700
 give vitality that I law that 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.740
 made four days that I'm in a 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.890
 marathon in great shape and of course and 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:13.840
 if the most ideal system that is 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:14.950
 for the cooking necessary for our health 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.190
 there is no doubt about it 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:21.520
 we have tested it in the laboratory we have 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:24.010
 tested the marion vapor cookie compared to 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:28.750
 the pressure cooker to put on the ceiling and 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:30.940
 in writing Napoleon iii 1884 we tested 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.490
 the microwave we tested every 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:37.450
 other cooking methods 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:40.150
 none have the quality of that one for 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.570
 help the food to give the best of 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.830
 himself 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.830
 donate for us 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:55.749
 that's it's true so I go out the 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:55.749
 meat 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.719
 I want to take out the eggs because there 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.770
 who likes it that they do not like 

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:06.050
 meat and skin that are vegetarian 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:09.110
 4 Well, we cook everything 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:13.460
 time is what you have to see is the 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:15.889
 color festival colors a meat 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.809
 in the vital isr it's amazing it's 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:22.039
 not wet hills and parables to eat 

00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:25.129
 kneeling before it's good no but it's 

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:27.080
 true it's the truth people if you 

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:28.610
 want it to be the same test you 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.339
 smell when a food is alive you 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:33.020
 digested fast you have it does not take 

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:34.460
 of energy you are not sleepy after 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.279
 a meal like that you're not 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:40.490
 tired while with a boiled meal 

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:42.620
 or pressure cooker or free 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.599
 this tiredness and after I punctured you 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.349
 want to take a nap before 

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:48.439
 going back to work 

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:50.719
 it's for me an indication it takes 

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:54.370
 your vitality while cooked in vita 

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:54.370
 the isr it gives you back vitality 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:01.940
 and 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:04.390
 2 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.390
 goal
