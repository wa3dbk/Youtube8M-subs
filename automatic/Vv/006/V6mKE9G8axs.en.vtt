fallout the only thing I could say is
that<00:03:59.840> one<00:04:00.110> of<00:04:00.260> them<00:04:00.440> the<00:04:01.069> brush<00:04:01.610> is<00:04:01.640> coming<00:04:02.150> off

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
that one of them the brush is coming off

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.080 
that one of them the brush is coming off
from<00:04:02.569> the<00:04:02.840> Pharaoh<00:04:03.349> but<00:04:04.190> if<00:04:04.760> you<00:04:04.849> don't<00:04:05.000> have

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
from the Pharaoh but if you don't have

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.309 
from the Pharaoh but if you don't have
any<00:04:05.270> brushes<00:04:05.540> this<00:04:05.840> would<00:04:05.959> be<00:04:06.080> a<00:04:06.110> great

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
any brushes this would be a great

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:09.729

investment<00:04:06.440> I<00:04:07.270> got<00:04:08.270> this<00:04:08.360> from<00:04:08.720> the<00:04:09.470> drugstore

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
investment I got this from the drugstore

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.040 
investment I got this from the drugstore
I<00:04:09.950> think<00:04:10.160> with<00:04:10.280> like<00:04:10.400> ten<00:04:10.610> dollars<00:04:11.030> 48<00:04:11.420> brushes

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
I think with like ten dollars 48 brushes

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.770 
I think with like ten dollars 48 brushes
so<00:04:12.349> it's<00:04:12.530> pretty<00:04:12.800> good<00:04:13.069> thing<00:04:13.610> though<00:04:14.569> it

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
so it's pretty good thing though it

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.860 
so it's pretty good thing though it
change<00:04:15.080> each<00:04:15.349> brush<00:04:16.269> the<00:04:17.269> next<00:04:17.510> two<00:04:17.630> things

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
change each brush the next two things

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.620 
change each brush the next two things
