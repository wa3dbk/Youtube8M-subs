00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.700
 For you, I'm here on the channel today. 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.799

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.039
 Our jewels, right? I know we loose. 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.510
 sometimes a month and a half ago maybe 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.270
 two months I do not know 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.789
 and I've never done a video showing the times 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.010
 So I apologize but it's the following to 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.519
 People took a photo with facebook is not 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.340
 gain 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.980
 so if you follow me there on instagram 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.430

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.350

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.200
 here at george official sunday 2013 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.149
 with the same name on my back here with 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:50.489
 the website is not 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:53.010
 here we have yes throughout the game that 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.920
 it was actually we made an accident 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.390
 so it's because he was a mini clan and like 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.170
 You can see we take his. 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.870
 we put the sport down here and I 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.200
 I think so, he soon got better. 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.080
 It got more professional and a way 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.880
 we have also improved here some 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.810
 things some graphic errors that I had 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.390
 11 a design in the design and was well 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.100
 cool, I really liked who made the designer 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.330
 Jorge was a guy was the American in 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.580
 It's true he lives here in the Andes. 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.920
 he know very thin people is the one that 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.020
 the type 22 version to day I'm very annoying 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.810
 with these things I wanted exactly the 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.619
 the way I was looking at the last 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:38.640
 view of something in armor from which they 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.750
 Do you know and with the colors of Brazil? 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.150
 Brazil's flag 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.340
 but the guy was perfect I was very 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.070
 happy with the design in our diocese and 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.009
 Pretty cool stuff too. 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.200
 Look here so you can see him here. 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.829
 she has this armor design 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:05.869
 things do not have the flag that below 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:08.759

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:12.330

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:16.019

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.299
