00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
so that was my deaf ear fede on the top

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.840 
so that was my deaf ear fede on the top
of<00:00:28.580> the<00:00:28.820> tank<00:00:29.420> and<00:00:32.110> here's<00:00:33.110> a<00:00:33.170> quick<00:00:33.920> scope<00:00:34.579> of

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
of the tank and here's a quick scope of

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.680 
of the tank and here's a quick scope of
a<00:00:34.879> setup<00:00:35.270> here<00:00:36.010> change<00:00:37.010> a<00:00:37.129> little<00:00:37.250> bit<00:00:37.690> so

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
a setup here change a little bit so

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.689 
a setup here change a little bit so
right<00:00:39.199> there<00:00:39.470> we<00:00:39.500> have<00:00:39.949> java<00:00:40.910> moss<00:00:42.339> my<00:00:43.339> sponge

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:43.699 
right there we have java moss my sponge

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:50.110 
right there we have java moss my sponge
there<00:00:44.739> and<00:00:45.739> then<00:00:46.370> we<00:00:46.730> we<00:00:47.690> have<00:00:48.100> blue<00:00:49.100> red<00:00:49.489> horn

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
there and then we we have blue red horn

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.820 
there and then we we have blue red horn
snail<00:00:50.480> here<00:00:51.879> another<00:00:52.879> one<00:00:53.150> there<00:00:53.210> I<00:00:53.769> think<00:00:54.769> I

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:54.830 
snail here another one there I think I

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.380 
snail here another one there I think I
got<00:00:55.010> a<00:00:55.040> total<00:00:55.309> of<00:00:55.549> eight<00:00:56.089> of<00:00:56.510> them<00:00:56.720> in<00:00:56.750> here<00:00:58.390> now

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
got a total of eight of them in here now

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.539 
got a total of eight of them in here now
the<00:00:59.449> tank<00:01:00.140> is<00:01:00.440> been<00:01:00.949> going<00:01:01.129> pretty<00:01:01.250> strong

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:01.549 
the tank is been going pretty strong

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:06.520 
the tank is been going pretty strong
there<00:01:02.379> was<00:01:03.379> a<00:01:03.409> trial<00:01:04.010> and<00:01:04.369> ear<00:01:04.790> when<00:01:05.780> I<00:01:05.810> when<00:01:06.500> I

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
there was a trial and ear when I when I

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.760 
there was a trial and ear when I when I
first<00:01:06.890> started<00:01:07.659> but<00:01:08.659> I<00:01:08.840> think<00:01:09.140> I<00:01:09.260> got<00:01:09.409> down<00:01:09.740> to

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
first started but I think I got down to

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.210 
first started but I think I got down to
the<00:01:10.549> part<00:01:10.820> where<00:01:10.970> there<00:01:11.240> to<00:01:11.450> reproduce<00:01:12.220> fairly

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
the part where there to reproduce fairly

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.690 
the part where there to reproduce fairly
well<00:01:13.600> and<00:01:14.600> survive<00:01:15.229> in<00:01:15.409> this<00:01:15.590> tank<00:01:16.780> so<00:01:17.780> I<00:01:18.700> went

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
well and survive in this tank so I went

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.200 
well and survive in this tank so I went
with<00:01:20.060> a<00:01:20.420> substrate<00:01:21.020> tank<00:01:21.740> here<00:01:22.090> where<00:01:23.090> if

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
with a substrate tank here where if

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.200 
with a substrate tank here where if
gravel<00:01:23.710> most<00:01:24.710> people<00:01:25.040> don't<00:01:25.280> really<00:01:25.549> go<00:01:25.970> with

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
gravel most people don't really go with

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.850 
gravel most people don't really go with
gravel<00:01:26.810> or<00:01:27.080> have<00:01:27.920> a<00:01:27.950> substrate<00:01:28.610> as<00:01:29.590> well<00:01:30.590> in

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
gravel or have a substrate as well in

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.360 
gravel or have a substrate as well in
their<00:01:31.190> definite<00:01:31.640> tank<00:01:31.910> but<00:01:32.390> I<00:01:32.600> do<00:01:32.780> this<00:01:33.370> just

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.370 
their definite tank but I do this just

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.080 
their definite tank but I do this just
for<00:01:34.550> the<00:01:34.700> purpose<00:01:35.180> of<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:35.780> bacteria<00:01:36.500> I<00:01:37.090> wanted

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
for the purpose of the bacteria I wanted

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.670 
for the purpose of the bacteria I wanted
to<00:01:38.330> be<00:01:38.840> your<00:01:39.350> low<00:01:39.650> minions<00:01:40.159> as<00:01:40.520> possible<00:01:41.120> and

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
to be your low minions as possible and

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:48.250 
to be your low minions as possible and
by<00:01:42.680> doing<00:01:43.400> this<00:01:43.670> it<00:01:46.030> you<00:01:47.030> know<00:01:47.120> the<00:01:47.390> gravel

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
by doing this it you know the gravel

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.840 
by doing this it you know the gravel
helps<00:01:48.680> break<00:01:49.100> down<00:01:49.130> any<00:01:49.610> organic<00:01:50.330> wastes<00:01:51.850> and

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
helps break down any organic wastes and

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.060 
helps break down any organic wastes and
that<00:01:53.090> means<00:01:53.300> less<00:01:53.570> work<00:01:53.930> and<00:01:54.290> less<00:01:54.770> water

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
that means less work and less water

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.270 
that means less work and less water
changes<00:01:56.020> there's<00:01:57.020> nothing<00:01:57.380> wrong<00:01:57.530> with<00:01:57.590> a<00:01:57.800> a

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
changes there's nothing wrong with a a

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.330 
changes there's nothing wrong with a a
bare<00:01:59.270> bottom<00:01:59.630> tank<00:01:59.659> you<00:02:00.200> know<00:02:00.290> nothing<00:02:01.220> wrong

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
bare bottom tank you know nothing wrong

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.010 
bare bottom tank you know nothing wrong
with<00:02:01.490> that<00:02:01.700> it's<00:02:02.030> just<00:02:02.150> that<00:02:02.570> you<00:02:02.870> were

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
with that it's just that you were

vet all the debris so but with this you
know<00:02:11.720> it's<00:02:12.230> easier<00:02:15.430> so<00:02:16.430> what<00:02:17.090> do<00:02:17.269> I<00:02:17.330> feed<00:02:17.810> them

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
know it's easier so what do I feed them

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.460 
know it's easier so what do I feed them
well<00:02:19.310> right<00:02:19.610> now<00:02:19.819> I'm<00:02:20.120> not<00:02:20.360> finding<00:02:20.599> any<00:02:20.989> green
