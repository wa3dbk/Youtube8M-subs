00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.959 

yeah<00:00:08.790> I<00:00:09.059> think<00:00:09.380> it<00:00:10.380> was<00:00:10.559> a<00:00:10.590> pretty<00:00:11.309> solid<00:00:11.610> match

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
yeah I think it was a pretty solid match

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.390 
yeah I think it was a pretty solid match
it<00:00:12.750> wasn't<00:00:13.110> enough<00:00:13.469> for<00:00:13.530> me<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:13.980> little<00:00:14.190> bit

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
it wasn't enough for me a little bit

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.900 
it wasn't enough for me a little bit
there<00:00:14.910> was<00:00:15.230> other<00:00:16.230> two<00:00:16.500> you<00:00:17.100> know<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.250> few<00:00:17.490> few

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
there was other two you know a few few

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.750 
there was other two you know a few few
errors<00:00:18.650> but<00:00:19.650> by<00:00:19.949> little<00:00:20.310> you<00:00:20.460> know<00:00:20.580> in

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
errors but by little you know in

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.120 
errors but by little you know in
important<00:00:21.270> moments<00:00:21.660> but<00:00:21.840> Serena<00:00:22.529> by<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.680> great

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
important moments but Serena by a great

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.060 
important moments but Serena by a great
match<00:00:23.779> you<00:00:24.779> know<00:00:24.900> she<00:00:24.960> was<00:00:25.140> she<00:00:25.769> was<00:00:25.800> better

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
match you know she was she was better

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.310 
match you know she was she was better
today<00:00:26.279> in<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.609> important<00:00:27.000> moments<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.570> she

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
today in the important moments and she

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.799 
today in the important moments and she
took<00:00:28.470> her<00:00:28.650> chance

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.020 

definitely<00:00:35.809> I<00:00:36.020> think<00:00:36.380> every<00:00:36.649> match<00:00:36.860> has<00:00:37.520> their

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
definitely I think every match has their

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.220 
definitely I think every match has their
own<00:00:38.829> character<00:00:39.829> to<00:00:40.090> you<00:00:41.090> know<00:00:41.239> every<00:00:41.870> time<00:00:42.079> we

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
own character to you know every time we

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.000 
own character to you know every time we
play<00:00:42.379> and<00:00:42.770> I<00:00:43.309> think<00:00:43.970> that<00:00:44.239> dynamic<00:00:44.870> was<00:00:45.050> was

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
play and I think that dynamic was was

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.040 
play and I think that dynamic was was
pretty<00:00:46.340> even<00:00:46.730> today<00:00:47.030> it<00:00:47.270> was<00:00:47.420> just<00:00:47.690> as<00:00:47.870> I<00:00:47.989> said

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
pretty even today it was just as I said

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.950 
pretty even today it was just as I said
she<00:00:48.890> was<00:00:49.070> sharper<00:00:49.610> definitely<00:00:50.420> the<00:00:50.480> sharp<00:00:50.750> are

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
she was sharper definitely the sharp are

00:00:50.960 --> 00:01:02.470 
she was sharper definitely the sharp are
in<00:00:51.080> the<00:00:51.199> key<00:00:51.379> moments<00:00:51.500> today

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:10.580 

sort<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.600> rhythm<00:01:03.799> playing<00:01:04.799> poker<00:01:05.700> face

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.569 

um<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:12.060> don't<00:01:12.420> know<00:01:12.719> I<00:01:12.810> think<00:01:13.070> he<00:01:14.070> knows<00:01:14.250> been

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:14.579 
um I don't know I think he knows been

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:16.550 
um I don't know I think he knows been
different<00:01:14.969> matches<00:01:15.390> sometimes<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.530> know

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
different matches sometimes you know

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.120 
different matches sometimes you know
though<00:01:16.859> it<00:01:17.130> was<00:01:17.250> very<00:01:17.579> quick<00:01:18.380> like<00:01:19.380> three<00:01:19.890> love

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
though it was very quick like three love

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.130 
though it was very quick like three love
in<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.399> first<00:01:20.579> set<00:01:20.850> for<00:01:21.149> her<00:01:21.270> it's<00:01:21.869> very

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
in the first set for her it's very

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.469 
in the first set for her it's very
different<00:01:22.409> dynamic<00:01:22.710> but<00:01:23.250> as<00:01:23.429> I<00:01:23.819> said<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:24.119> think

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
different dynamic but as I said I think

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.139 
different dynamic but as I said I think
it<00:01:24.569> was<00:01:24.689> more<00:01:24.899> solid<00:01:25.740> today<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.490> was<00:01:26.700> just<00:01:27.000> a

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
it was more solid today it was just a

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:28.760 
it was more solid today it was just a
matter<00:01:27.329> of<00:01:27.509> those<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:28.140> know<00:01:28.200> really<00:01:28.469> key

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
matter of those you know really key

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.429 
matter of those you know really key
moments<00:01:29.219> to<00:01:29.549> go<00:01:29.969> for<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.840> felt<00:01:31.110> like<00:01:31.259> in

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
moments to go for it and I felt like in

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.039 
moments to go for it and I felt like in
a<00:01:31.500> second<00:01:31.860> set<00:01:32.069> I<00:01:32.280> was<00:01:32.880> going<00:01:33.209> for<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.569> more<00:01:33.869> I

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
a second set I was going for it more I

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.410 
a second set I was going for it more I
just<00:01:34.439> miss<00:01:35.130> hit<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.490> little<00:01:35.640> bit<00:01:38.000> first<00:01:39.000> you're

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
just miss hit a little bit first you're

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.399

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:43.760 

the<00:01:42.590> greatest<00:01:42.799> source<00:01:43.130> of<00:01:43.280> all

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
the greatest source of all

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.220 
the greatest source of all
far

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:49.230 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.910 

um<00:01:49.770> it's<00:01:50.250> never<00:01:50.490> easy<00:01:50.790> it's<00:01:51.030> not<00:01:51.150> a<00:01:51.270> secret<00:01:51.920> but

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
um it's never easy it's not a secret but

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.020 
um it's never easy it's not a secret but
i<00:01:53.520> think<00:01:54.120> i<00:01:54.660> was<00:01:55.020> able<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.650> break<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.610> break<00:01:56.820> her

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
i think i was able to break to break her

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.990 
i think i was able to break to break her
today<00:01:57.330> and<00:01:57.540> i<00:01:58.080> had<00:01:58.500> chances<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.370> do<00:01:59.760> that<00:01:59.790> again

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
today and i had chances to do that again

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.110 
today and i had chances to do that again
you<00:02:00.540> know<00:02:00.630> i<00:02:00.840> think<00:02:00.870> to<00:02:01.200> close<00:02:01.380> out<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.770> set

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
you know i think to close out the set

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.700 
you know i think to close out the set
but<00:02:03.120> of<00:02:03.420> course<00:02:03.660> she<00:02:03.750> has<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.050> very<00:02:04.440> powerful

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
but of course she has a very powerful

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.790 
but of course she has a very powerful

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:11.710 
think to meet exist it's a matter of

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.130 
think to meet exist it's a matter of
going<00:03:12.490> out<00:03:12.820> there<00:03:13.120> and<00:03:13.150> giving<00:03:13.570> you<00:03:13.810> a<00:03:13.840> hundred

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
going out there and giving you a hundred

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.200 
going out there and giving you a hundred
percent<00:03:14.230> every<00:03:14.890> day<00:03:15.310> because<00:03:15.820> no<00:03:15.970> matter<00:03:16.120> how

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
percent every day because no matter how

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.020 
percent every day because no matter how
confident<00:03:16.840> you<00:03:16.990> are<00:03:17.110> if<00:03:17.380> you<00:03:17.590> don't<00:03:17.800> focus<00:03:18.520> if

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
confident you are if you don't focus if

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.630 
confident you are if you don't focus if
you<00:03:19.210> don't<00:03:19.390> give<00:03:19.600> a<00:03:20.070> hundred<00:03:21.070> percent<00:03:21.220> and

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
you don't give a hundred percent and

you don't give a hundred percent and
every<00:03:21.850> point<00:03:22.090> you're<00:03:23.020> not<00:03:23.140> going<00:03:23.320> to<00:03:23.380> win

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
every point you're not going to win

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:33.110 
every point you're not going to win
victory<00:03:25.000> cooking

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.199 

I<00:03:33.290> think<00:03:34.290> every<00:03:34.680> match<00:03:34.860> was<00:03:37.159> improvement

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
I think every match was improvement

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.390 
I think every match was improvement
definitely<00:03:39.209> had<00:03:39.470> very<00:03:40.470> different<00:03:40.620> opponents

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
definitely had very different opponents

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.339 
definitely had very different opponents
and<00:03:42.080> the<00:03:43.080> matter<00:03:43.319> of<00:03:43.530> adaptation<00:03:44.370> to<00:03:44.549> those<00:03:44.700> of

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:45.349 
and the matter of adaptation to those of

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:48.819 
and the matter of adaptation to those of
opponents<00:03:46.349> was<00:03:47.129> the<00:03:47.310> key<00:03:47.519> this<00:03:47.700> week<00:03:47.970> because

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
opponents was the key this week because

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.830 
opponents was the key this week because
you<00:03:49.829> know<00:03:49.950> after<00:03:50.190> after<00:03:50.700> practicing<00:03:51.540> for<00:03:51.810> a

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
you know after after practicing for a

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.619

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:54.629 
while you really need to see what you

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:57.500
