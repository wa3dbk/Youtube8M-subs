if Patrick Beverley is not on the floor
however<00:00:54.539> despite<00:00:55.230> Patrick<00:00:55.829> Beverley<00:00:56.250> being

probably going to start here on
Wednesday<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.870> still<00:01:01.410> think<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.649> Blazers<00:01:01.980> have

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
Wednesday I still think the Blazers have

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.310 
Wednesday I still think the Blazers have
a<00:01:02.190> lot<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.430> value<00:01:02.850> at<00:01:03.000> plus<00:01:03.300> six<00:01:03.660> they<00:01:03.870> this<00:01:04.199> is

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
a lot of value at plus six they this is

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.960 
a lot of value at plus six they this is
going<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.559> be<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.650> very<00:01:04.860> close<00:01:05.129> series<00:01:05.400> these

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
going to be a very close series these

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.460 
going to be a very close series these
two<00:01:06.180> teams<00:01:06.420> are<00:01:06.600> mirror<00:01:06.869> images<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.350> one

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
two teams are mirror images of one

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.840 
two teams are mirror images of one
another<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.979> they<00:01:08.070> match<00:01:08.250> up<00:01:08.280> very<00:01:08.460> well

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
another and they match up very well

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.700 
another and they match up very well
against<00:01:09.360> one<00:01:09.570> another<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:10.020> expect<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.470> very

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
against one another and I expect a very

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.649 
against one another and I expect a very
very<00:01:10.950> close<00:01:11.220> series<00:01:11.490> throughout<00:01:11.850> six<00:01:12.270> points

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
very close series throughout six points

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.810 
very close series throughout six points
here<00:01:12.869> with<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.530> Blazers<00:01:13.950> as<00:01:14.130> good<00:01:14.549> as<00:01:14.670> they've

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
here with the Blazers as good as they've

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.609 
here with the Blazers as good as they've
been<00:01:15.090> this<00:01:15.330> season<00:01:15.540> against<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.110> Rockets<00:01:16.470> I

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
been this season against the Rockets I

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.800 
been this season against the Rockets I
think<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.340> probably<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.880> little<00:01:18.180> bit<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.600> a

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
think is probably a little bit of a

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.469 
think is probably a little bit of a
value<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.920> even<00:01:20.159> though<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.369> total<00:01:20.729> at<00:01:20.820> 214

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
value and even though the total at 214

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.969 
value and even though the total at 214
looks<00:01:21.689> like<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.869> value<00:01:22.200> as<00:01:22.320> well<00:01:22.470> with<00:01:22.680> how<00:01:22.799> many

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
looks like a value as well with how many

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.499 
looks like a value as well with how many
I<00:01:23.070> think<00:01:23.280> blessed<00:01:23.549> eight<00:01:23.790> times<00:01:24.150> these<00:01:24.360> two

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
I think blessed eight times these two

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.789 
I think blessed eight times these two
teams<00:01:24.689> have<00:01:24.840> played<00:01:25.049> including<00:01:25.229> this<00:01:25.560> last

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
teams have played including this last

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.620 
teams have played including this last
one<00:01:25.950> have<00:01:26.100> gone<00:01:26.250> over<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.729> total<00:01:26.880> i<00:01:27.180> think

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
one have gone over the total i think

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.420 
one have gone over the total i think
Blazers<00:01:27.990> plus<00:01:28.229> six<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.619> actually<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.220> play

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
Blazers plus six is actually the play

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.590 
Blazers plus six is actually the play
they<00:01:29.490> have<00:01:29.610> now<00:01:29.820> covered<00:01:30.180> three<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.479> their

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
they have now covered three of their

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.030 
they have now covered three of their
last<00:01:30.630> four<00:01:31.020> including<00:01:31.350> this<00:01:31.619> one<00:01:31.829> playoff

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
last four including this one playoff

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.130 
last four including this one playoff
game<00:01:32.369> vs<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.210> houston<00:01:33.329> rockets<00:01:33.570> they're<00:01:34.020> also

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
Blazers do play very well when they're

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.670 
Blazers do play very well when they're
on<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.579> roll<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:42.060> with<00:01:42.450> Aldridge<00:01:42.899> back<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.500> his

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
on a roll and with Aldridge back to his

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.069 
on a roll and with Aldridge back to his
mvp-caliber<00:01:44.399> self<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.390> he<00:01:45.479> was<00:01:45.600> before<00:01:45.840> he

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
was before he got hurt I think this

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.999 
was before he got hurt I think this

going to really help them I think and

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.880
