00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.230
 ando por happens in Italy with respect to the launch of the holder of the promotion of the ver 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.519
 we found a kindergarten in piedmont where the children are accompanied to the 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.159
 wine production 

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:20.099
 we have a picture of the kindergarten children with a bottle of wine in their hands 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:24.369
 but then how will these children be when they have become 11 years old? 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.919
 17 years to convince them that this product so well illustrated by them 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:33.680
 mistress is actually a container of a toxic substance that ethyl alcohol 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.399
 which we have all done at least in my school 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.600
 fermenting everything up to get mine was a great mystery 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.069
 that they all make together 

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:47.309
 but this hahaha besides the naturalness with which I say too much tear 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.289
 also this element 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.629
 then it becomes more difficult at some point I would say I now seem to have given me one 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.629
 personal note we are a crazy paranoid when I get angry with all the family 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.160
 starting from the grandparents 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.350
 which offer that both Christmas and New Year's Eve 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.390
 the glass I offer kidneys that my daughter is from when she is little 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.510
 very small 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.410
 handrail tavern on 29 games with this thing how many women did if 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.260
 you tell me no to modern football they all did well on the plate 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.230
 I jump to Havana tylomelania now I have to get angry and it is not 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.840
 possible that as I bend

 nudiste san daniele 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.440
 you can't drink style offer here is how do I change this one 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.490
 hence the water our culture has a weight 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.020
 absolutely extraordinary this is 1 supplement 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.270
 weekly newspaper of a well-known newspaper 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.740
 and 'the title is very specific those who drink wine campÃ  cient'anne and come 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.930
 illustrated for the virtues tel resveratrol that this substance leeks 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.050
 a package in this period contained in the wine then I'm happy the article but well 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.210
 few I finish it does not read anyway to have a curative concentration 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.330
 for at least 40 liters of red wine a day, absolutely no 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.650
 impossible, given that it was true, but I can only see it with his 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.160
 now that it's good &amp; lt 3 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.980
 they are the same thing to see what you need to be contained elsewhere 

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:11.040
 in the peel 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.220
 Grape berries then might as well eat snails, perhaps a little healthier 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.610
 respect the drinking of wine and there is love, perhaps a little bit d - and - in this speech 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.989
 however we have not introduced the theme of the 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.390
 marketing because question comes rightly said what comes 

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:28.339
 our families take place in the class dog eats on families 

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:32.819
 however, we also take business on Tuesday instead of behind 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:38.169
 read so kind and so much more hate and love and daniele messages arrive 

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:42.429
 here is the crime while we see what is then the but what is behind it 

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:47.380
 without extra charge preferred rules of alfredo wine producer and for you 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.400
 because I think that wine is a big business 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.350
 wine production is a bargain at a loss for telephone calls that come 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.120
 from the state to those who cultivate it to those who produce wine and to whom it sells 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.140
 so many and at our expense that our state from mentions with flower 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.320
 a production that is bad for our nation for every euro 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.790
 that enters the state coffers about wine and other drinks 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.820
 alcoholics come out at least and I say at least two 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:22.059
 for a test let's take a very practical example try to rent one 

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:25.059
 disco for the party we will play the son's birthday 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:29.569
 and they will tell you a figure if you say but I prefer them that evening rather than not 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:34.319
 they are distributed alcoholic beverages the figure doubles means that in all 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.729
 the discos and the small ones to the big ones the gain comes 

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:39.169
 doubled 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:42.529
 measure of alcoholic beverages take for a default user flies into 

00:03:42.529 --> 00:03:46.729
 terminal - production and a birth to be norm he is really norm 

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:50.519
 immediately given the brave because we invited then we go forward 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:51.679
 drug 

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:53.860
 still the potato the peculiarity 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.010
 ah so let's stay 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.769
 the drug arrested 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:02.829
 this is what is declared to be our land given by state which enjoys 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:06.639
 acceptance of strong resistance to be controlled for what it has 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:08.019
 say 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:12.379
 absolutely just released a research with the prestige relance magazine 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:15.790
 that the bible for researchers says that the prostate 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.269
 that induces more drug addict to raper the absolute society and it is 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.580
 much more than ruining the four times as much compared to marijuana is 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.259
 in fact the ethyl alcohol contained in the viewfinder on this I would like to hear 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:29.810
 races also valsecchi 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.870
 what is the fornaretto started 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.150
 it is a big samba disc I asked testator what we were saying 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.160
 at the beginning on luca alcohol 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.040
 even on gambling but today we are talking about alcohol what kind of state it is 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.100
 I was just 20 and was not interested 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.919
 of health except then 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.919
 and are the incredible to cure or 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.669
 when he is there 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:02.669
 a problem links the road accidents and therefore 

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:05.590
 they say of me that if it follows essermene 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.900
 20 sale 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.270
 in we see only when 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.499
 let's do some 

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:16.860
 road accident investigation levels 

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:21.289
 and alcohol and above all the number of possible alcohol and persons 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:26.300
 involved car accident far higher than what he sees show on 

00:05:26.299 --> 00:05:27.710
 standard prohibits 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.350
 the past of selling alcohol to children under the age of 16 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.490
 meanwhile I would ask you from experts 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.830
 this is the right threshold for the age of 16 but alcohol can be sold 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.750
 to our children d'oh 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.520
 absolutely not I would say absolutely now 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.510
 and as my colleagues have said to remove the myth that the culture of wine 

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:54.600
 as a drug, however, legalized in an unethical and even more difficult state 

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:57.119
 at the moment if this 

00:05:57.119 --> 00:06:01.759
 pepper legislative mission because those guys like I said 

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:06.229
 who do not organize just go with a seventeen year old mate you buy 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:11.360
 what you want not just because you don't even need your 17 year old companion often 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.250
 why 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.370
 that rule seems to be because you look in the Rome areas where you are 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.520
 he also knows a little more about the small cuts they ever say party to 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.639
 home &amp; lt 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:26.399
 even just go to the markets reserved for tax evaders what the machine is for 

00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:29.729
 look who do not require an identity card there is no good practice 

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:33.919
 apone as are the artisans that too low but not even matri 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:38.069
 spectators. if almost 20 percent of boys between 11 and 15 years old 

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:39.309

 got him bought alcohol 

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:46.580
 but without requiring any identity cards zcs minimum resistance 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:50.000
 moreover, it seems very easy to organize 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.890
 there are products designed specifically for Santiano's adolescents 

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:59.110

 maybe in Italy a few years ago the branches we say so on the scope too 

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:33.409

 gradations 

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:50.070
 between three meters 7 degrees but with a number let's say glasses or drinks 

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.779
 so advertised also by our TV

 real estate intermediary to better finish the land 

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:09.800
 in reality it is a big problem so the alcohol enters
