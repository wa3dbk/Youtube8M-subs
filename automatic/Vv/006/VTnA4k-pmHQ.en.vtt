00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.769
 cream melted and then 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.280

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.230
 wide and long 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.750
 I have so three narrow slides here 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:03.050
 I just get up next to each other 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.600
 give my baking paper and there is hoping 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:09.790
 then just the pain of chocolate 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:13.240
 and then you can just do that 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.240
 smooth out 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:24.020
 So it's really stupid that his son 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:27.500
 After a while, the solid chunks 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.390
 or you wait your head and as soon as you 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.210
 notices what has become stronger now 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:39.200
 you can just do the slide here 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:43.640
 lying aside and could do that 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:45.860
 then just for a change 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:49.460
 I have to carry and become very firm 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:52.580
 Then you just stuck together so 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.470
 the walls and this will be so cold 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:59.860
 so here I will be the 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.860
 simply pull off the film but carefully 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:14.030
 Here I will just darken 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:15.500
 Jersey is the strip bit 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:18.490

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:04.590
