00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
start stiffening up a little bit no we

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.790 
start stiffening up a little bit no we
had<00:00:39.150> decided<00:00:40.150> that<00:00:40.360> before<00:00:40.810> the<00:00:40.900> game<00:00:41.080> maximum

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.280 
had decided that before the game maximum
45<00:00:42.090> so<00:00:43.090> we<00:00:43.180> don't<00:00:43.360> pick<00:00:43.510> up<00:00:43.630> any<00:00:43.780> stupid

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290 
45 so we don't pick up any stupid

injuries<00:00:44.739> with<00:00:44.920> his<00:00:45.040> tight<00:00:45.340> muscle<00:00:45.970> and<00:00:46.180> I

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
injuries with his tight muscle and I

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.840 
injuries with his tight muscle and I
think<00:00:47.500> he<00:00:47.680> probably<00:00:47.710> are<00:00:48.400> on<00:00:48.520> the<00:00:48.640> same

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
think he probably are on the same

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.840 
think he probably are on the same
maximum<00:00:49.780> 45<00:00:50.140> 60<00:00:50.860> minutes<00:00:51.129> on<00:00:51.220> Saturday<00:00:51.730> and

maximum 45 60 minutes on Saturday and

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.700 
maximum 45 60 minutes on Saturday and
then<00:00:52.000> I<00:00:52.030> think<00:00:52.360> it<00:00:52.510> will<00:00:52.600> be<00:00:52.660> back<00:00:52.900> for<00:00:53.110> 90<00:00:53.559> for
