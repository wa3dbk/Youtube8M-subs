you

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.660 

originally<00:03:36.390> I<00:03:36.450> was<00:03:36.540> going<00:03:36.629> to<00:03:36.780> do<00:03:37.310> the<00:03:38.310> yellow

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
originally I was going to do the yellow

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.330 
originally I was going to do the yellow
and<00:03:38.939> magenta<00:03:39.239> first<00:03:39.900> and<00:03:40.200> then<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.590> blue<00:03:40.950> but

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
and magenta first and then the blue but

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.830 
and magenta first and then the blue but
you<00:03:41.430> can<00:03:41.579> kind<00:03:41.790> of<00:03:41.849> see<00:03:42.030> how<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.209> blue<00:03:42.450> kind<00:03:42.750> of

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
you can kind of see how the blue kind of

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.380 
you can kind of see how the blue kind of
blows<00:03:43.650> out<00:03:43.920> the<00:03:43.950> yellow<00:03:44.340> and<00:03:44.489> magenta<00:03:44.700> like<00:03:45.209> it

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
blows out the yellow and magenta like it

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.229 
blows out the yellow and magenta like it
doesn't<00:03:45.569> look<00:03:45.780> like<00:03:46.700> it<00:03:47.700> just<00:03:47.909> looks<00:03:48.090> like

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
doesn't look like it just looks like

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.970 
doesn't look like it just looks like
more<00:03:48.450> blue<00:03:48.689> you<00:03:49.200> know<00:03:49.349> like<00:03:49.650> the<00:03:49.829> difference

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
more blue you know like the difference

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.339 
more blue you know like the difference
between<00:03:50.099> that<00:03:50.489> blue<00:03:50.640> and<00:03:50.790> upwards<00:03:51.120> to<00:03:51.420> slight

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
between that blue and upwards to slight

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:56.479 
between that blue and upwards to slight
so<00:03:53.340> I<00:03:54.000> decided<00:03:54.480> to<00:03:54.870> do<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.680> blue<00:03:55.859> first<00:03:56.220> and

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
so I decided to do the blue first and

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.470 
so I decided to do the blue first and
then<00:03:56.700> the<00:03:56.730> magenta<00:03:58.670> I'm<00:03:59.670> sorry<00:04:00.000> blue<00:04:00.239> first

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
then the magenta I'm sorry blue first

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.759 
then the magenta I'm sorry blue first
then<00:04:00.659> the<00:04:00.750> yellow<00:04:00.959> and<00:04:00.989> the<00:04:01.140> magenta<00:04:01.530> you<00:04:01.620> can

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
then the yellow and the magenta you can

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.470 
then the yellow and the magenta you can
see<00:04:01.920> how<00:04:02.040> different<00:04:02.069> that<00:04:02.430> is<00:04:02.609> that<00:04:03.030> in<00:04:03.299> that

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
see how different that is that in that

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.509 
see how different that is that in that
is<00:04:04.230> really<00:04:04.650> different<00:04:04.829> than<00:04:05.069> that<00:04:05.129> in<00:04:05.400> that

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
is really different than that in that

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.390 
is really different than that in that
and<00:04:06.409> that's<00:04:07.409> the<00:04:07.590> way<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:07.709> Bujinkan<00:04:08.129> was<00:04:08.250> not

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
and that's the way the Bujinkan was not

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.860 
and that's the way the Bujinkan was not
on<00:04:08.519> top<00:04:08.639> to<00:04:08.819> yellow<00:04:09.060> so<00:04:09.359> I<00:04:09.389> knew<00:04:09.569> that<00:04:09.599> was

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
on top to yellow so I knew that was

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.319 
on top to yellow so I knew that was
going<00:04:09.959> to<00:04:10.019> look<00:04:10.170> good
