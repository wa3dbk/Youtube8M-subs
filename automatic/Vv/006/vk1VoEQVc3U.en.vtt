can be a local problem with your
digestion<00:00:34.680> digestive<00:00:35.489> system<00:00:35.910> it<00:00:36.390> could<00:00:36.660> be

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
digestion digestive system it could be

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.810 
digestion digestive system it could be
that<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.079> protein<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.530> you're<00:00:37.890> eating<00:00:38.280> is

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
that the protein that you're eating is

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.090 
that the protein that you're eating is
too<00:00:39.180> heavy<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.320> not<00:00:40.559> prepared<00:00:41.040> properly

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
too heavy and is not prepared properly

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.600 
too heavy and is not prepared properly
and<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.960> could<00:00:43.170> be<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.739> protein<00:00:44.160> itself

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
and it could be that the protein itself

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.090 
and it could be that the protein itself
doesn't<00:00:45.030> have<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.600> proper<00:00:46.020> qualities<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.980> be

doesn't have the proper qualities to be

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.639 
doesn't have the proper qualities to be
digested<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.820> absorbed<00:00:47.940> properly<00:00:48.420> so<00:00:49.350> this

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
digested and absorbed properly so this

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.720 
digested and absorbed properly so this
protein<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.520> fresh<00:00:50.850> paneer<00:00:51.390> or<00:00:51.539> cheese<00:00:52.140> is

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
protein is fresh paneer or cheese is

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.520 
protein is fresh paneer or cheese is

call it meaning when it goes into your

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.319 
call it meaning when it goes into your

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
how to get absorbed and digested so you

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.390 
how to get absorbed and digested so you
get<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.879> benefit<00:01:03.359> out<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.949> method

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
get the benefit out of it and the method

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.730 
get the benefit out of it and the method
that<00:01:05.580> it's<00:01:05.760> prepared<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:06.689> also<00:01:07.320> highly

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
that it's prepared is also highly

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.250 
that it's prepared is also highly
intelligent<00:01:08.100> it's<00:01:09.030> very<00:01:09.360> minimal<00:01:09.630> we<00:01:10.110> use

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
intelligent it's very minimal we use

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.590 
intelligent it's very minimal we use
very<00:01:10.650> simple<00:01:10.979> steps<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.729> very<00:01:12.119> basic

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
very simple steps and very basic

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.539 
very simple steps and very basic
ingredients<00:01:13.229> natural<00:01:13.650> ingredients<00:01:14.250> because

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
ingredients natural ingredients because

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:15.770 
ingredients natural ingredients because
there<00:01:14.700> are<00:01:14.850> ways<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.210> using<00:01:15.390> other

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
there are ways of using other

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.450 
there are ways of using other
ingredients<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.740> make<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:18.470> so<00:01:19.470> this<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.280> it

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
ingredients to make it and so this is it

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.480 
ingredients to make it and so this is it
then<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.880> just<00:01:21.119> get<00:01:21.299> fresh<00:01:21.720> paneer<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.590> the

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
then you just get fresh paneer and the

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.280 
then you just get fresh paneer and the
way<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.700> can<00:01:24.000> prepare<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.720> just<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.259> know

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
way you can prepare it is just you know

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.380 
way you can prepare it is just you know
I<00:01:25.409> mean<00:01:25.470> there's<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:25.920> many<00:01:26.009> recipes<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:27.210> many

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
I mean there's so many recipes so many

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.120 
I mean there's so many recipes so many
ways<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.810> combine<00:01:28.200> this<00:01:28.350> paneer<00:01:28.770> into<00:01:28.890> your

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
ways to combine this paneer into your

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.550 
ways to combine this paneer into your
meals<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.479> will<00:01:30.689> show<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:30.930> one<00:01:31.350> way<00:01:31.530> to

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
meals and I will show you one way to

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.700 
meals and I will show you one way to
consume<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:32.610> as<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.880> sweet<00:01:33.240> dish<00:01:33.270> in<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.380> next

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
consume it as a sweet dish in the next

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.679 
consume it as a sweet dish in the next
clip<00:01:35.100> but<00:01:35.490> first<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:36.000> would<00:01:36.150> like<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.450> show<00:01:36.630> you

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
clip but first I would like to show you

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.140 
clip but first I would like to show you
how<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:36.990> put<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.350> together<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.460> have<00:01:38.909> already

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
how to put it together so I have already

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.920 
how to put it together so I have already
here<00:01:40.070> started<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.189> process<00:01:41.490> for<00:01:42.180> warming

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
here started the process for warming

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.670 
here started the process for warming
some<00:01:43.380> milk<00:01:44.630> ideally<00:01:45.630> if<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:45.869> can<00:01:46.170> get<00:01:46.380> raw

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
some milk ideally if you can get raw

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.359 
some milk ideally if you can get raw
milk

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
milk

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.670 
milk
it's<00:01:47.909> what's<00:01:48.390> recommended<00:01:49.170> because<00:01:49.320> it's

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
it's what's recommended because it's

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.060 
it's what's recommended because it's
been<00:01:50.030> unprocessed<00:01:51.030> untouched<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:52.740> will

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
been unprocessed untouched and it will

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.249 
been unprocessed untouched and it will
be<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.399> best<00:01:53.640> in<00:01:54.030> terms<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.509> being<00:01:54.780> absorbed

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
be the best in terms of being absorbed

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.289 
be the best in terms of being absorbed
and<00:01:55.500> digested<00:01:55.979> by<00:01:56.130> your<00:01:56.340> body<00:01:56.549> but<00:01:56.880> these<00:01:57.090> days

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
and digested by your body but these days

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.999 
and digested by your body but these days
it's<00:01:57.509> becoming<00:01:57.840> harder<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.320> harder<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.860> get

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
it's becoming harder and harder to get

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.280 
it's becoming harder and harder to get
raw<00:01:59.189> milk<00:01:59.460> so<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.240> next<00:02:00.509> preferable<00:02:01.049> thing

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
raw milk so the next preferable thing

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.130 
raw milk so the next preferable thing
for<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.860> do<00:02:02.009> is<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.430> get<00:02:02.640> non<00:02:03.299> homogenized

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
for you to do is to get non homogenized

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.399 
for you to do is to get non homogenized
pasteurized<00:02:04.710> milk<00:02:05.390> so<00:02:06.390> non<00:02:06.600> homogenized<00:02:07.200> milk

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
pasteurized milk so non homogenized milk

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.169 
pasteurized milk so non homogenized milk
means<00:02:07.799> it<00:02:07.950> hasn't<00:02:08.160> been<00:02:08.429> through<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.700> process

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
means it hasn't been through the process

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.059 
means it hasn't been through the process
where<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.569> fat<00:02:09.810> molecules<00:02:10.020> are<00:02:10.500> broken<00:02:10.619> down

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
where the fat molecules are broken down

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.490 
where the fat molecules are broken down
and<00:02:11.430> distributed<00:02:12.239> equally<00:02:12.720> over

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
and distributed equally over

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.630 
and distributed equally over
whole<00:02:13.820> milk<00:02:14.820> and<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.750> get<00:02:16.020> creamed<00:02:16.350> up<00:02:16.620> on<00:02:17.280> top

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
whole milk and you get creamed up on top

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.600 
whole milk and you get creamed up on top
of<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:18.090> milk<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:19.020> that's<00:02:19.530> easier<00:02:20.160> to<00:02:20.400> digest

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
of the milk and that's easier to digest

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.180 
of the milk and that's easier to digest
if<00:02:21.510> you<00:02:21.750> can<00:02:21.930> find<00:02:22.170> not<00:02:22.350> pasteurized<00:02:22.650> of

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
if you can find not pasteurized of

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.520 
if you can find not pasteurized of
course<00:02:23.490> it's<00:02:23.790> ideal<00:02:24.180> but<00:02:24.510> it's<00:02:24.840> hard<00:02:25.140> like<00:02:25.350> I

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
course it's ideal but it's hard like I

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.300 
course it's ideal but it's hard like I
said<00:02:25.910> but<00:02:26.910> if<00:02:27.330> you<00:02:27.570> can<00:02:27.720> stay<00:02:28.020> away<00:02:28.380> from<00:02:28.440> flash

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
said but if you can stay away from flash

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.060 
said but if you can stay away from flash
pasteurized<00:02:30.150> milk<00:02:30.300> then<00:02:31.050> it's<00:02:31.440> also<00:02:31.680> a<00:02:31.800> good

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
pasteurized milk then it's also a good

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.760 
pasteurized milk then it's also a good
thing<00:02:32.130> because<00:02:32.630> flash<00:02:33.630> pasteurization<00:02:34.560> means

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
thing because flash pasteurization means

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.210 
thing because flash pasteurization means
they<00:02:35.070> expose<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.790> milk<00:02:36.060> only<00:02:36.959> a<00:02:37.290> few<00:02:37.680> seconds

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
they expose the milk only a few seconds

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.730 
they expose the milk only a few seconds
even<00:02:38.459> milliseconds<00:02:39.270> probably<00:02:39.930> to<00:02:40.110> high<00:02:40.350> heat

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
even milliseconds probably to high heat

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.949 
even milliseconds probably to high heat
and<00:02:41.100> that's<00:02:41.670> how<00:02:41.880> they<00:02:42.060> pasteurize<00:02:42.300> it<00:02:42.780> but

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
and that's how they pasteurize it but

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.210 
and that's how they pasteurize it but
you<00:02:43.080> can<00:02:43.230> imagine<00:02:43.470> how<00:02:43.860> high<00:02:44.160> the

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
you can imagine how high the

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.270 
you can imagine how high the
temperatures<00:02:44.970> of<00:02:45.209> that<00:02:45.500> heat<00:02:46.500> must<00:02:46.830> be<00:02:46.980> to

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
temperatures of that heat must be to

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.310 
temperatures of that heat must be to
pasteurize<00:02:47.820> it<00:02:47.850> instantly<00:02:48.480> like<00:02:48.750> that<00:02:48.989> and<00:02:49.230> it

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
pasteurize it instantly like that and it

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.140 
pasteurize it instantly like that and it
does<00:02:49.530> things<00:02:49.800> to<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.160> molecules<00:02:50.670> of<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:50.910> milk

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
does things to the molecules of the milk

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
does things to the molecules of the milk
so<00:02:51.750> anyways<00:02:52.350> what<00:02:52.680> you<00:02:52.890> will<00:02:53.010> need<00:02:53.220> today<00:02:53.459> is

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
so anyways what you will need today is

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.320 
so anyways what you will need today is
milk<00:02:55.170> if<00:02:55.980> you<00:02:56.310> want<00:02:56.580> to<00:02:56.730> do<00:02:56.910> this<00:02:57.090> the

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
milk if you want to do this the

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.290 
milk if you want to do this the
traditional<00:02:57.959> way<00:02:58.890> you<00:02:59.700> need<00:02:59.940> to<00:03:00.120> get

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
traditional way you need to get

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.380 
traditional way you need to get
cheesecloth<00:03:01.610> which<00:03:02.610> you<00:03:02.760> can<00:03:02.910> get<00:03:03.030> from<00:03:03.239> any

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
cheesecloth which you can get from any

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.440 
cheesecloth which you can get from any
grocery<00:03:03.989> store<00:03:04.340> or<00:03:05.340> if<00:03:05.670> you<00:03:05.820> have<00:03:06.030> a<00:03:06.060> clean

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
grocery store or if you have a clean

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.670 
grocery store or if you have a clean
unused<00:03:07.430> cotton<00:03:08.430> shirt<00:03:08.870> white<00:03:09.870> shirt<00:03:10.230> you<00:03:10.530> can

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
unused cotton shirt white shirt you can

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.520 
unused cotton shirt white shirt you can
also<00:03:10.830> cut<00:03:11.160> that<00:03:11.370> up<00:03:11.630> either<00:03:12.630> is<00:03:12.959> fine<00:03:13.260> I'm

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
also cut that up either is fine I'm

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.199 
also cut that up either is fine I'm
going<00:03:14.040> to<00:03:14.220> show<00:03:14.370> you<00:03:14.430> both<00:03:14.700> ways<00:03:14.760> and<00:03:15.150> I'm

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
going to show you both ways and I'm

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.259 
going to show you both ways and I'm
going<00:03:15.420> to<00:03:15.510> show<00:03:15.750> you<00:03:15.810> also<00:03:16.020> the<00:03:16.440> shortcut<00:03:17.370> for

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
going to show you also the shortcut for

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:35.570 
going to show you also the shortcut for
making<00:03:22.519> milk<00:03:23.519> comes<00:03:23.940> to<00:03:24.150> a<00:03:24.180> boil<00:03:33.739> so<00:03:34.739> next<00:03:35.010> step

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
making milk comes to a boil so next step

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:41.990 
making milk comes to a boil so next step
is<00:03:37.220> the<00:03:38.220> whole<00:03:38.519> purpose<00:03:39.090> is<00:03:39.930> to<00:03:40.709> break<00:03:41.670> the

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
is the whole purpose is to break the

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.220 
is the whole purpose is to break the
milk<00:03:42.299> and<00:03:43.070> separate<00:03:44.070> the<00:03:44.640> milk<00:03:44.910> solids<00:03:45.230> from

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
milk and separate the milk solids from

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:52.039 
milk and separate the milk solids from
the<00:03:46.290> way<00:03:48.019> so<00:03:49.019> let's<00:03:49.829> add<00:03:50.130> I<00:03:50.519> am<00:03:51.120> going<00:03:51.660> to<00:03:51.840> use

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
the way so let's add I am going to use

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:57.490 
the way so let's add I am going to use
fresh<00:03:52.709> lime<00:03:53.540> to<00:03:54.540> break<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:55.019> milk<00:03:56.060> now

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
fresh lime to break the milk now

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.590 
fresh lime to break the milk now
different<00:03:58.500> recipes<00:03:59.160> can<00:03:59.820> use<00:04:00.060> lemon<00:04:01.190> vinegar

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
different recipes can use lemon vinegar

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.750 
different recipes can use lemon vinegar
citric<00:04:03.600> acid<00:04:04.079> so<00:04:04.590> on<00:04:04.680> and<00:04:04.860> so<00:04:05.040> forth<00:04:05.400> anything

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
citric acid so on and so forth anything

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.970 
citric acid so on and so forth anything
that's<00:04:05.970> sour<00:04:06.269> that<00:04:06.630> will<00:04:06.870> react<00:04:07.560> with<00:04:07.799> the

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
that's sour that will react with the

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.729 
that's sour that will react with the
milk<00:04:08.670> molecules<00:04:09.329> to<00:04:09.660> break<00:04:09.870> things<00:04:10.140> down<00:04:10.470> but

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
milk molecules to break things down but

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:18.110 
milk molecules to break things down but
we<00:04:10.950> will<00:04:11.130> use<00:04:11.370> lime<00:04:16.340> so<00:04:17.340> usually<00:04:17.850> there's<00:04:18.030> a

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
we will use lime so usually there's a

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.599 
we will use lime so usually there's a
basic<00:04:18.660> standard<00:04:19.109> amount<00:04:19.769> of<00:04:19.950> how<00:04:20.130> much<00:04:20.310> lime

basic standard amount of how much lime
you<00:04:20.790> should<00:04:21.000> put<00:04:21.239> but<00:04:21.510> because<00:04:21.959> it<00:04:22.500> all

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
you should put but because it all

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.980 
you should put but because it all
depends<00:04:23.099> on<00:04:23.160> how<00:04:23.400> sour<00:04:23.760> or<00:04:24.180> less<00:04:24.419> sour<00:04:24.720> the

of<00:04:27.920> the<00:04:28.010> lime<00:04:28.220> you<00:04:29.090> really<00:04:29.450> have<00:04:29.630> to<00:04:29.810> learn<00:04:30.020> how

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
of the lime you really have to learn how

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.360 
of the lime you really have to learn how
to<00:04:30.980> respond<00:04:31.730> to<00:04:32.030> the<00:04:32.330> milk<00:04:32.600> as<00:04:32.870> it's<00:04:33.050> breaking

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
to respond to the milk as it's breaking

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.980 
to respond to the milk as it's breaking
in<00:04:34.370> front<00:04:34.670> of<00:04:34.760> you<00:04:34.880> so<00:04:35.000> I<00:04:35.030> just<00:04:35.120> put<00:04:35.540> squeezed

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
in front of you so I just put squeezed

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.310 
in front of you so I just put squeezed
one<00:04:36.350> lime<00:04:36.680> juice<00:04:37.010> in<00:04:37.190> there<00:04:37.400> and<00:04:38.240> it's<00:04:38.840> almost

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
one lime juice in there and it's almost

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:52.810 
one lime juice in there and it's almost
breaking<00:04:46.000> yes<00:04:47.000> looks<00:04:47.690> like<00:04:47.930> we<00:04:48.140> got<00:04:48.380> it<00:04:48.560> I<00:04:51.820> have

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
breaking yes looks like we got it I have

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.040 
breaking yes looks like we got it I have
I<00:04:53.240> have<00:04:54.220> yellowish<00:04:55.220> water<00:04:56.030> which<00:04:56.600> is<00:04:56.750> the<00:04:56.900> way

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
I have yellowish water which is the way

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.950 
I have yellowish water which is the way
water<00:04:57.350> and<00:04:57.770> inside<00:04:58.460> you<00:04:58.640> can<00:04:58.820> see<00:04:59.060> clumps<00:04:59.750> of

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
water and inside you can see clumps of

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:09.790 
water and inside you can see clumps of
milk<00:05:00.650> solids<00:05:00.950> which<00:05:01.730> is<00:05:01.970> the<00:05:02.210> milk<00:05:08.410> okay<00:05:09.410> so

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
milk solids which is the milk okay so

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.790 
milk solids which is the milk okay so
next<00:05:10.180> so<00:05:11.180> this<00:05:11.360> is<00:05:11.570> one<00:05:11.750> way<00:05:11.900> of<00:05:12.050> doing<00:05:12.200> it<00:05:12.560> you

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
next so this is one way of doing it you

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.000 
next so this is one way of doing it you
boiled<00:05:13.550> it<00:05:13.670> you<00:05:14.270> broke<00:05:14.600> it<00:05:14.810> down<00:05:15.050> and<00:05:15.410> now

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
boiled it you broke it down and now

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:17.980 
boiled it you broke it down and now
you're<00:05:16.220> gonna<00:05:16.400> pour<00:05:16.850> the<00:05:17.060> whole<00:05:17.210> thing<00:05:17.270> you

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
you're gonna pour the whole thing you

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.390 
you're gonna pour the whole thing you
can<00:05:18.170> put<00:05:18.380> the<00:05:18.560> strainer<00:05:18.980> with<00:05:19.310> the

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
can put the strainer with the

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.570 
can put the strainer with the
cheesecloth<00:05:19.880> in<00:05:20.390> your<00:05:20.720> sink<00:05:21.110> rest<00:05:22.070> it<00:05:22.250> there

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
cheesecloth in your sink rest it there

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.440 
cheesecloth in your sink rest it there
and<00:05:22.790> then<00:05:23.420> pour<00:05:23.720> it<00:05:23.870> through<00:05:25.000> so<00:05:26.000> we<00:05:26.300> are

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 
and then pour it through so we are

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.410 
and then pour it through so we are
capturing<00:05:27.020> the<00:05:27.980> milk<00:05:28.220> solids<00:05:28.490> so<00:05:28.880> this<00:05:29.060> is<00:05:29.210> one

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:29.420 
capturing the milk solids so this is one

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:30.580 
capturing the milk solids so this is one
way<00:05:29.600> of<00:05:29.630> doing<00:05:29.810> it

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
way of doing it

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.220 
way of doing it
let<00:05:31.040> me<00:05:31.220> show<00:05:31.430> you<00:05:31.490> quickly<00:05:31.870> so<00:05:32.870> then<00:05:33.080> you

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:33.230 
let me show you quickly so then you

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:40.570 
let me show you quickly so then you
would<00:05:33.410> tie<00:05:33.740> this<00:05:39.010> you<00:05:40.010> should<00:05:40.190> be<00:05:40.310> careful

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
would tie this you should be careful

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.430 
would tie this you should be careful
because<00:05:40.850> it's<00:05:41.150> really<00:05:41.330> hot<00:05:41.660> some<00:05:41.990> people<00:05:42.260> like

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
because it's really hot some people like

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.220 
because it's really hot some people like
to<00:05:42.470> run<00:05:42.830> water<00:05:43.190> over<00:05:43.340> it<00:05:43.760> as<00:05:43.910> well<00:05:43.940> and<00:05:44.420> then

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:45.230 
to run water over it as well and then

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.280 
to run water over it as well and then
you<00:05:45.260> can<00:05:45.530> just<00:05:45.680> squeeze<00:05:46.250> it<00:05:46.550> and<00:05:46.990> then<00:05:47.990> make

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:48.290 
you can just squeeze it and then make

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:52.140 
you can just squeeze it and then make
sure<00:05:48.320> that<00:05:48.910> if<00:05:49.910> you<00:05:50.300> want<00:05:50.600> it<00:05:50.840> to<00:05:51.170> be<00:05:51.320> nice<00:05:51.620> and

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
sure that if you want it to be nice and

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.150 
sure that if you want it to be nice and
hard<00:05:53.150> so<00:05:53.510> that<00:05:53.540> you<00:05:53.810> can<00:05:54.020> cut<00:05:54.440> it<00:05:54.590> into<00:05:54.740> cubes

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.160 
hard so that you can cut it into cubes

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.550 
hard so that you can cut it into cubes
which<00:05:55.730> is<00:05:55.880> what<00:05:56.180> you<00:05:56.450> know<00:05:56.600> some<00:05:56.810> recipes<00:05:57.290> call

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 
which is what you know some recipes call

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.230 
which is what you know some recipes call
for<00:05:57.590> then<00:05:58.250> you<00:05:58.400> make<00:05:58.580> sure<00:05:58.760> that<00:05:58.910> you<00:05:59.060> drain

00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 
for then you make sure that you drain

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.600 
for then you make sure that you drain
out<00:05:59.420> all<00:05:59.600> of<00:05:59.660> the<00:06:00.170> way<00:06:00.350> water<00:06:00.650> from<00:06:01.070> here<00:06:01.310> if

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
out all of the way water from here if

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.670 
out all of the way water from here if
you<00:06:01.910> like<00:06:02.330> it<00:06:02.480> to<00:06:02.570> be<00:06:02.720> a<00:06:02.750> little<00:06:02.900> moist<00:06:03.290> and<00:06:03.560> you

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 
you like it to be a little moist and you

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.130 
you like it to be a little moist and you
like<00:06:03.860> to<00:06:04.100> put<00:06:04.490> it<00:06:04.610> into<00:06:04.760> your<00:06:04.880> meals<00:06:05.270> in<00:06:05.870> a

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:06.140 
like to put it into your meals in a

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.050 
like to put it into your meals in a
scrambled<00:06:06.680> fashion<00:06:07.160> then<00:06:07.400> you<00:06:07.490> can<00:06:07.670> keep<00:06:07.820> it<00:06:08.000> a

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
scrambled fashion then you can keep it a

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.330 
scrambled fashion then you can keep it a
little<00:06:08.090> more<00:06:08.330> moist<00:06:08.780> but<00:06:09.410> this<00:06:09.650> is<00:06:09.800> one<00:06:10.010> way<00:06:10.190> of

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:10.340 
little more moist but this is one way of

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.130 
little more moist but this is one way of
doing<00:06:10.520> it<00:06:10.850> and<00:06:11.090> then<00:06:11.180> I'm<00:06:11.600> going<00:06:11.780> to<00:06:11.870> show<00:06:12.080> you

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:12.140 
doing it and then I'm going to show you

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:17.760 
doing it and then I'm going to show you
the<00:06:12.320> shortcut<00:06:13.150> which<00:06:14.150> basically<00:06:14.660> consists

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:17.770 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:23.230 

just<00:06:18.770> using<00:06:19.280> a<00:06:19.370> tea<00:06:19.640> strainer<00:06:20.770> and<00:06:21.880> going<00:06:22.880> just

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:23.240 
just using a tea strainer and going just

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.260 
just using a tea strainer and going just
so

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.270 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:34.060 

I<00:06:31.450> used<00:06:32.450> to<00:06:32.630> use<00:06:32.750> a<00:06:32.780> cheesecloth<00:06:33.410> for<00:06:33.860> many

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.070 
I used to use a cheesecloth for many

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:38.250 
I used to use a cheesecloth for many
years<00:06:34.750> but<00:06:35.750> then<00:06:35.960> one<00:06:36.230> day<00:06:36.440> one<00:06:36.800> friend<00:06:37.190> said

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:38.260 
years but then one day one friend said

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:42.160 
years but then one day one friend said
this<00:06:39.260> is<00:06:39.440> what<00:06:39.680> I<00:06:39.710> do<00:06:39.920> and<00:06:40.570> ever<00:06:41.570> since<00:06:41.870> then

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:42.170 
this is what I do and ever since then

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.500 
this is what I do and ever since then
I've<00:06:42.410> chosen<00:06:42.740> the<00:06:43.040> lazy<00:06:43.280> method<00:06:43.850> and<00:06:44.090> it<00:06:44.240> works

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:44.510 
I've chosen the lazy method and it works

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:49.600 
I've chosen the lazy method and it works
so<00:06:46.210> here<00:06:47.210> we<00:06:47.360> go<00:06:47.570> I<00:06:47.810> captured<00:06:48.620> the<00:06:49.010> rest<00:06:49.220> of<00:06:49.460> the

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:49.610 
so here we go I captured the rest of the

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.540 
so here we go I captured the rest of the
myth<00:06:49.850> of<00:06:50.180> the<00:06:50.240> paneer<00:06:51.140> and<00:06:51.920> I<00:06:52.130> make<00:06:52.370> sure<00:06:52.520> I

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:52.550 
myth of the paneer and I make sure I

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.210 
myth of the paneer and I make sure I
strain<00:06:53.000> out<00:06:53.210> the<00:06:53.540> extra<00:06:54.200> water<00:06:54.380> I<00:06:54.710> like<00:06:55.070> to

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:55.220 
strain out the extra water I like to

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.680 
strain out the extra water I like to
keep<00:06:55.400> my<00:06:55.610> cheese<00:06:55.820> a<00:06:55.880> little<00:06:56.240> more<00:06:56.450> moist

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:56.690 
keep my cheese a little more moist

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:59.560 
keep my cheese a little more moist
because<00:06:57.320> I<00:06:57.470> find<00:06:57.770> it's<00:06:57.950> tastier<00:06:58.580> that<00:06:58.820> way<00:06:59.060> and

00:06:59.560 --> 00:06:59.570 
because I find it's tastier that way and

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:01.600 
because I find it's tastier that way and
I<00:07:00.260> don't<00:07:00.320> like<00:07:00.650> it<00:07:00.830> too<00:07:00.980> hard<00:07:01.190> unless<00:07:01.460> the

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:01.610 
I don't like it too hard unless the

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.970 
I don't like it too hard unless the
recipe<00:07:02.030> calls<00:07:02.270> for<00:07:02.420> it<00:07:02.750> so<00:07:03.350> once<00:07:03.740> I've

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:03.980 
recipe calls for it so once I've

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.910 
recipe calls for it so once I've
captured<00:07:04.250> this<00:07:04.730> I<00:07:05.120> can<00:07:05.960> refrigerate<00:07:06.290> this

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:06.920 
captured this I can refrigerate this

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.950 
captured this I can refrigerate this
ideally<00:07:07.850> it's<00:07:08.030> nice<00:07:08.240> if<00:07:08.420> you<00:07:08.510> can<00:07:08.630> make<00:07:08.810> this

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 
ideally it's nice if you can make this

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.510 
ideally it's nice if you can make this
fresh<00:07:09.260> and<00:07:09.440> consume<00:07:09.830> it<00:07:09.980> on<00:07:10.100> the<00:07:10.220> spot

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:10.520 
fresh and consume it on the spot

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.120 
fresh and consume it on the spot
otherwise<00:07:11.420> you<00:07:11.690> know<00:07:11.810> we're<00:07:11.990> all<00:07:12.110> working<00:07:12.560> men

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:13.130 
otherwise you know we're all working men

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.520 
otherwise you know we're all working men
and<00:07:13.160> women<00:07:13.430> so<00:07:14.180> you<00:07:14.240> can<00:07:14.510> store<00:07:14.750> this<00:07:14.930> up<00:07:15.170> you

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:15.530 
and women so you can store this up you

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.170 
and women so you can store this up you
know<00:07:15.680> depending<00:07:16.160> on<00:07:16.250> how<00:07:16.400> much<00:07:16.550> you<00:07:16.730> made<00:07:16.940> up

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:17.180 
know depending on how much you made up

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.540 
know depending on how much you made up
to<00:07:17.360> four<00:07:17.600> or<00:07:17.690> five<00:07:17.750> days<00:07:18.200> even<00:07:18.920> though<00:07:19.190> we<00:07:19.340> say

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:19.550 
to four or five days even though we say

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:21.880 
to four or five days even though we say
in<00:07:19.700> our<00:07:19.820> Veda<00:07:20.180> not<00:07:20.510> to<00:07:20.660> refrigerate<00:07:20.990> and<00:07:21.680> you

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:21.890 
in our Veda not to refrigerate and you

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:24.430 
in our Veda not to refrigerate and you
know<00:07:22.040> eat<00:07:22.670> things<00:07:23.030> like<00:07:23.660> that<00:07:23.930> because<00:07:24.320> we

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:24.440 
know eat things like that because we

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.800 
know eat things like that because we
don't<00:07:24.560> want<00:07:24.800> to<00:07:24.890> consume<00:07:25.430> leftovers<00:07:26.120> but<00:07:26.630> this

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:26.810 
don't want to consume leftovers but this

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:28.870 
don't want to consume leftovers but this
is<00:07:26.960> considered<00:07:27.170> a<00:07:27.530> raw<00:07:27.740> material<00:07:28.400> it's<00:07:28.640> not

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:28.880 
is considered a raw material it's not

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.600 
is considered a raw material it's not
cooked<00:07:29.330> and<00:07:29.540> processed<00:07:30.110> so<00:07:30.770> it's<00:07:31.130> okay<00:07:31.490> to

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:31.610 
cooked and processed so it's okay to

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.670 
cooked and processed so it's okay to
store<00:07:32.030> in<00:07:32.150> the<00:07:32.270> fridge<00:07:32.510> and<00:07:32.840> then<00:07:32.960> consume<00:07:33.500> you
