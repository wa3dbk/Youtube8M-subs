00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:04.600
 and this the fuck I get the more 

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:07.870
 Quickly up out cañaveral 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.940
 florida is going to produce justly 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:13.770
 launches of the first flight not 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.770
 manned with rockets from this one 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:32.840
 the NASA sends to space in this 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.610
 first signal flight 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:40.880
 thanks to the international network of roses 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:46.950
 in this way already the song of the nasa 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:49.950
 to send to make test flights 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.900
 yes had good results 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.100
 board a delta 4 rocket of the 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.160
 companies 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.400
 heiland 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.380
 from Cape Canaveral in Florida this 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.780
 capture action designed to perform 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.520
 manned trips is further away from the 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.820
 low Earth orbit and even 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.820
 arrive 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:16.360
 remember that this release of this 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.159
 orion capsule unmanned was 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.929
 planned for yesterday but for 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.299
 climatic problems and also by 

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:26.380
 a form with a boat in the sea 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:29.020
 could not be released finally already 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.619
 some moments there has been the 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.740
 launch of the orion capsule that the 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:40.929
 ship is sending to make a first 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:43.299
 curious test flight is going to give you two 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:46.209
 turns to the earth at a distance of 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:49.270
 five thousand 793 kilometers of the planet 

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:50.590
 some cruises is farther than the 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:55.179
 distance from space station 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:58.179
 international is known to have 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:02:02.380
 even that this tour lasts 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:04.209
 approximately four hours later 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.680
 after completing then both by 

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:11.450
 land views and travel more than 96 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:14.700
 500 kilometers this Orion capsule goes to 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.700
 re-enter the atmosphere to a 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:21.060
 Speed ​​of 32,000 kilometers per hour 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.940
 and at a temperature of 2 thousand 200 degrees 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.070
 senses before descending from a 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.440
 coast of baja california mestres el 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.110
 peaceful ocean that's why the day of 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.240
 yesterday where was that is to suspend the 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.310
 birth of the plane apple because no 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.800
 it can be normal from a boat 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.200
 that this journalist hit the sun and 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.870
 if some changes in the olives and 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.820
 they asked for the exit of the capsule of 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.790
 although it has finally been released 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.770
 a few seconds ago 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.480
 we imagine that these are images that 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:55.910
 are being registered by the capsule 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:58.739
 orion from outside territory outside 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:01.230
 the friendly earth for our world from 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.790
 space is not what you are seeing and 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.650
 that life of thanks of the signal of the 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.170
 incredible international agency this 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.250
 week in this formed appreciate it live 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.390
 and live 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.180
 of what is 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.270
 registering the orion capsule launched by 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.950
 the nasa here are these images and how 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:21.440
 is that the capsule is moving away 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.440
 time more than the earth 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.230
 and it is indeed the first time that a 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:32.370
 ship designed to be manned by 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:34.470
 humans travel to deep space from 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.780
 what happened then as the program 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.240
 only songs to the moon will be remembered 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.270
 in the year 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.600
 the seventies that are the year 72 even 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.560
 in this capsule it is known that it has been 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.720
 originally designed within the 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.180
 constellation program with which the 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.880
 Nasa hopes to put the 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.460
 man on the moon approximately in the 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.890
 year 2020 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.170
 the president of the republic of 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.340
 usa barack obama canceled that project 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.420
 in the year 2010 because it had a high 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:11.940
 cost 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:14.520
 it is known that the nasa is going to have going to 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.639
 have a new vehicle of their own for the 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.320
 daily 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:21.810
 because since he retired in 2012 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.860
 account for ferry uses 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:28.380
 depends on the Soyuz Russian ships for 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.520
 do the relays in the administration 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.520
 they become three spatial 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.030
 and these are images that you are capturing 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:47.190
 that is capturing the orion capsule that 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.020
 these have been released a few minutes 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.139
 by the nasa from cabo cañaveral florida 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.410
 this time, it was already possible to carry out 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:55.980
 success yesterday was suspended by themes 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.440
 climatological and also a boat 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:01.110
 that was planned is known as what 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.210
 we had said that this capsule win 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.919
 two laps on the earth then going to 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.690
 complete two the two candles in the 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:11.820
 earth and then it will go back then to 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:15.510
 until the earth to descend to the ocean 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:18.240
 later on we will return 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.490
 Well with information this information 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.990
 world - wide interest is the capsule 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.630
 Orion that has been launched by NASA in 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.490
 this is the launch of tests you have 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.250
 expected that later also the 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.740
 nasa send capsules again with 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:35.120
 crew ships with crew to 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.120
 board very well 7
