00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.990 
the one I just can't let go of I keep
hoping<00:05:12.110> that<00:05:12.350> Leatherhead<00:05:13.010> is<00:05:13.220> viewed<00:05:13.700> as<00:05:13.880> an

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
hoping that Leatherhead is viewed as an

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.690 
hoping that Leatherhead is viewed as an
essential<00:05:14.150> enough<00:05:15.020> character<00:05:15.620> to<00:05:16.220> maybe<00:05:16.460> get

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.700 
essential enough character to maybe get

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.700 
essential enough character to maybe get
another<00:05:16.970> outlet<00:05:17.480> for<00:05:17.630> release<00:05:18.050> like<00:05:18.680> a

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
another outlet for release like a

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.280 
another outlet for release like a
talking<00:05:19.160> version<00:05:19.760> who<00:05:20.360> would<00:05:20.510> be<00:05:20.660> larger<00:05:21.260> than

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.290 
talking version who would be larger than

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
talking version who would be larger than
the<00:05:21.560> basic<00:05:21.950> figure<00:05:22.780> or<00:05:23.780> maybe<00:05:24.500> playmates<00:05:25.100> will

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
the basic figure or maybe playmates will

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.730 
the basic figure or maybe playmates will
look<00:05:25.550> back<00:05:25.820> to<00:05:26.000> that<00:05:26.030> whole<00:05:26.360> mega<00:05:26.750> mutant<00:05:27.260> idea

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
look back to that whole mega mutant idea

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.000 
look back to that whole mega mutant idea
they<00:05:27.950> had<00:05:28.130> with<00:05:28.310> the<00:05:28.460> original<00:05:28.550> line<00:05:30.010> only

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
they had with the original line only

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:37.000 
they had with the original line only
time<00:05:31.520> will<00:05:31.760> tell<00:05:31.790> I<00:05:31.970> guess<00:05:33.430> stay<00:05:34.430> rad<00:05:34.670> folks
