00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.839
 Hello, welcome to this tutorial 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:10.210
 of how to draw in this case I'm going to 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:13.360
 draw my duke dog 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:17.740
 how clear it is impossible to have it here 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:20.800
 I've still picked up the laptop I took 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:24.080
 a photo and good as we are going to draw 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.650
 just the head I'm going to focus 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:31.270
 in the head and that's it 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.270
 I leave here next 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.200
 how the tutorial goes 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.520
 to last a lot I'll go stopping I'll 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.210
 go making photos of the process 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.550
 so it's not so long 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.149
 well nothing first we have to 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:52.220
 do is go head fitting it 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:56.910
 simply because 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:01:00.240
 we are fitting in by doing the lines 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.870
 more or less where are the eyes 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.870
 nose 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.720
 ears 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.159
 everyone knows what a dog is like or 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.159
 less 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.830
 9 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.710
 its spots 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.080
 and little by little it's going better if 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.840
 you have started to draw now is 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.530
 normal that a churro comes out 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.530
 but good 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.460
 now we start 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.340
 let's shade the nose first 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.680
 we go down to the mouth we make the hair of the 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.450
 At the hill we went a little bit up 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:57.040
 we make one ear another ear 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.840
 we blew a little 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:03.280
 and we end up giving it the final touches 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:06.830
 to the eyes in the ear the nose as 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.850
 vÃ©lez is very well retouched 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:14.320
 and we end up giving it the final touches 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:18.710
 and we already have the portrait of our dog 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:21.210
 easy simple and good for whoever 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:24.050
 like to draw 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.050
 a greeting
