 gleisi canal couto dear perfect and 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.830
 this someone here on youtube for some 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.420
 half my life in the 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.399
 comments in order to place the 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.649

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.780
 Credits Aquino Description 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.899
 who saw a toy that will also be 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.050
 in the description and one that is based on 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:47.809
 Do you tell a little more about your 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.809
 literary taste together 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.660
 O 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:12.090
 Thank you to grandpa hp will start to lose 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.040
 Too long past the sound car to pass 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.189
 in my street you have my calm 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.700
 the first question is the gender of 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.630
 literature that you keep away from me 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.780
 I'm not far from horror books. 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:30.270
 because I would die of fear that I have 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.570
 it is the kind of suspense already do 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:37.350
 afraid but but there's more 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:40.619
 I was going to carrie the strange because the movie 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.920
 incredible incredible feeling and i need 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.509
 know how they beyond terror 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.280
 I was the one who thought I would be too. 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:53.700
 away from self-help garden as a whole 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:57.720
 But it was only that time I do not know. 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.819
 I rode away from them. 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.560
 Why do you have on the shelf you're ashamed? 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:03.119
 of not having lived 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.909
 I have two books for that question. 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.009
 why I dream right I have never been a 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.580
 Just book, do not even ask the shame. 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.120
 huh 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:16.380
 first is stf mayer sei host 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.359
 I think it's bigger and I've seen the movie 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.070
 so many times and today the film 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:23.670
 incredibly incredible but I have one 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:26.940
 question of law and the needle of that but it is 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.579
 the hostess and the book I said as 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.950
 said in the same year marathon 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:37.380
 I mean I stopped at the very end 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.850
 but I can not read this business is 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.170
 very still 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.880
 - I'll explain why otherwise we'll 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.850
 want to kill just because I did not find 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.910
 very much ours is but I do not know maybe one day 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.600
 if I do, I'll get the idea of 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.970
 where I stopped 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:58.920
 the third question, what is your worst 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:01.560
 habit while reading my worst habit 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:06.190
 of the reader is that when I do not have 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:09.640
 post your double the sheets I make 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.320
 here I give to the tips of the leaves 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.260
 when I do not have post 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:19.720
 It's just making it clear I love the 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:22.300
 leaflets to mark because 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.950
 have time I do not have post near me 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.500
 and then I go there and with the 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.920
 compound is the habit of the river 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:36.030
 I do not do at home another terrible terrible 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:40.060
 that I usually practice in the capital she is 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:42.640
 it's getting crooked as you read why I 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.310
 usually takes my bed then I 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.530
 I get totally crooked when I remember 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.780
 I can not stay ruler with his dog 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.850
 erect with the book here reading I do not 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.560
 I got it so I think this would be a 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.050
 act is bad 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.800
 4 you usually read the synopsis before 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:05.710
 read the book 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:08.380
 The last brs purchases I make overall 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:11.080
 - ong indicates dream of people but never 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.970
 ended up reading this so our question is whether the 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.799
 We're okay right synopsis and because 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:19.359
 synopses are the drugs I took 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.919
 Eternities to read divergent because of 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.470
 from that damn synopsis because I went 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:25.750
 read if we but this lady with the 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.720
 technician is my worst story of my 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.669
 life because she really does a long time 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:34.870
 a Portuguese at home 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:37.660
 the book that is and I stayed so long 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:41.230
 without buying this book that I remember until 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.060
 today of my frustration because the novel 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.240
 so famous animal had exploded 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:49.710
 world-wide such thing will be 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:55.270
 What I buy is that the meeting and the 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:57.840
 destined to this ours of this book is a 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:01.870
 Dude that's why I avoid not reading the 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:04.550
 95 what is the most expensive book 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.650
 they then before but I still 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.780
 not sure if it's still him 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.509
 because I know I do not remember 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:14.629
 prices but so far as I can 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:16.550
 I remember, I remember that zombie. 

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:18.560
 of strings of internal authors that I 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:23.599
 I need to review this because they 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:26.120
 they are incredible and I think I think I know 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:30.050
 if you buy used books I realize I 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:31.819
 I do not even buy a bookstore but not seduces 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:35.000
 when I have the opportunity and have the 

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:38.330
 books I want in samba with 158 not 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.690
 walked 7th with this physical bookstore 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:44.030
 Favorite looks I hate the bookstore that there is 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.719
 need because everything triple the 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.120
 price 

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:51.310
 then found itself takes home 20 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.310
 40 or more real 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.849
 so I would not vote it would take more physics 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:57.409
 When I'm going to SÃ£o Paulo, where should I go? 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:00.469
 decide if it means I like the most 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:03.319
 it is from this area that they have a mall there that 

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:08.300
 you speak 8 which solidarity 'online 

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:12.849
 preferred've ever bought a two to 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:15.139
 now because I'm afraid if 

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:16.819
 I wanted to say ours but I 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:19.610
 I am I can buy enough in Hail 

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:21.560
 and in spain because I already bought 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:24.069
 enough books on the streets and both are 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.069
 OK 

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:29.050
 if you have a store trust the book if 

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:31.009
 there was a failure because the more 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:33.529
 companies to buy in amazon 

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:36.560
 still having a moment just bought in the mouth 

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:37.380
 because it then becomes why they passed to the 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.110
 buyer 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:42.990
 The mother and the baby the ship you have a 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:47.580
 monthly budget to buy books 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:49.140
 In the beginning I had it and I was heavy, I'm 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.580
 I liked books but now I have more 

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:52.110
 sense 10 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.120
 Who did you win the coach of the world? 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:56.640
 Are you watching video if you did not do this? 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.840
 video there by chance want to pass 

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.770
 I'm calm 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:03.840
 It's because I do not know who did it and did not 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:07.170
 did because the probably one of the 

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:09.300
 last to do because I'm wide 3g 

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:11.430
 This people went to him and confessed 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.650
 bibliophile I hope you have 

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:14.850
 liked to know a little more of the 

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:18.270
 my literary taste 

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:20.160
 so I found this taste of white if 

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:21.720
