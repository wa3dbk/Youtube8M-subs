the<00:00:31.800> strategy<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.790> pair<00:00:33.030> each<00:00:33.329> number<00:00:33.809> with

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
the strategy is to pair each number with

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.930 
the strategy is to pair each number with
its<00:00:34.230> inverse<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:35.250> because<00:00:35.550> we're<00:00:35.730> working

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
its inverse and because we're working

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.720 
its inverse and because we're working
mod<00:00:36.300> P<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:37.380> integers<00:00:37.770> mod<00:00:37.950> P<00:00:38.160> are<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.370> field

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
mod P the integers mod P are a field

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.700 
mod P the integers mod P are a field
which<00:00:39.360> means<00:00:39.540> other<00:00:39.750> than<00:00:40.020> 0<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.410> can't

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
which means other than 0 you can't

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.760 
which means other than 0 you can't
divide<00:00:40.950> by<00:00:40.980> 0<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:41.540> every<00:00:42.540> nonzero<00:00:42.780> number<00:00:43.559> mod

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
divide by 0 so every nonzero number mod

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.130 
divide by 0 so every nonzero number mod
P<00:00:44.010> has<00:00:44.250> an<00:00:44.520> inverse<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.480> we<00:00:45.840> should

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
P has an inverse so we should

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.170 
P has an inverse so we should
conceivably<00:00:46.860> be<00:00:47.100> able<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.309> pair<00:00:47.579> every<00:00:47.820> number

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
conceivably be able to pair every number

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.240 
conceivably be able to pair every number
with<00:00:48.420> its<00:00:48.570> inverse<00:00:48.870> but<00:00:49.440> there<00:00:49.950> are<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.129> few

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
with its inverse but there are a few

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.580 
with its inverse but there are a few
exceptions<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.690> exceptions<00:00:52.230> are<00:00:52.410> there

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
exceptions and the exceptions are there

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.529 
exceptions and the exceptions are there
are<00:00:52.770> some<00:00:53.100> numbers<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.730> are<00:00:54.329> their<00:00:54.510> own

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
are some numbers that are their own

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.080 
are some numbers that are their own
inverse<00:00:55.050> so<00:00:55.500> let's<00:00:55.739> see<00:00:55.920> which<00:00:56.129> ones<00:00:56.370> which

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
inverse so let's see which ones which

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.330 
inverse so let's see which ones which
ones<00:00:57.329> those<00:00:57.570> are<00:00:57.809> if<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.559> number<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:58.890> this<00:00:59.129> own

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
ones those are if a number is this own

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.540 
ones those are if a number is this own
inverse<00:00:59.870> that<00:01:00.870> means<00:01:01.079> it's<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.469> solution<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.160> x

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
inverse that means it's a solution to x

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.920 
inverse that means it's a solution to x
squared<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.840> congruent<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.530> 1<00:01:04.710> mod<00:01:04.920> P<00:01:05.930> because

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
squared is congruent to 1 mod P because

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.660 
squared is congruent to 1 mod P because
x<00:01:07.380> times<00:01:07.740> itself<00:01:08.100> x<00:01:08.369> squared<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:09.689> gives<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.350> 1

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
x times itself x squared it gives you 1

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.539 
x times itself x squared it gives you 1
now<00:01:11.670> we<00:01:11.729> can<00:01:11.939> solve<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.409> congruence<00:01:13.549> let's

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
now we can solve this congruence let's

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.880 
now we can solve this congruence let's
just<00:01:14.729> subtract<00:01:15.119> 1<00:01:15.509> from<00:01:15.540> both<00:01:15.689> sides<00:01:15.890> that

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
just subtract 1 from both sides that

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.130 
just subtract 1 from both sides that
gives<00:01:17.100> us<00:01:17.250> x<00:01:17.490> squared<00:01:17.820> minus<00:01:18.180> 1<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.720> congruent

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
gives us x squared minus 1 is congruent

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.499 
gives us x squared minus 1 is congruent
to<00:01:19.290> 0<00:01:19.380> mod<00:01:19.830> P<00:01:21.350> now<00:01:22.350> we<00:01:22.409> factor<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:23.790> gives<00:01:24.000> us<00:01:24.210> X

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
to 0 mod P now we factor that gives us X

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.100 
to 0 mod P now we factor that gives us X
minus<00:01:24.689> 1<00:01:25.200> times<00:01:25.590> X<00:01:26.040> plus<00:01:26.430> 1<00:01:26.729> this<00:01:27.720> can<00:01:27.900> grow

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
minus 1 times X plus 1 this can grow

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.850 
minus 1 times X plus 1 this can grow
into<00:01:28.200> 0<00:01:28.500> mod<00:01:28.740> p<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.869> now<00:01:30.869> we<00:01:30.930> just<00:01:31.229> solve<00:01:31.650> this

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
into 0 mod p and now we just solve this

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.319 
into 0 mod p and now we just solve this
like<00:01:32.040> we<00:01:32.250> would<00:01:32.430> in<00:01:32.549> algebra<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:34.070> now<00:01:35.070> we<00:01:35.130> just

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
like we would in algebra so now we just

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:38.840 
like we would in algebra so now we just
set<00:01:36.329> each<00:01:36.450> factor<00:01:36.479> equal<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:37.049> 0<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:37.799> if<00:01:38.009> X<00:01:38.369> minus

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
set each factor equal to 0 so if X minus

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.920 
set each factor equal to 0 so if X minus
1<00:01:39.090> is<00:01:39.240> congruent<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.780> 0<00:01:39.810> mod<00:01:40.350> P<00:01:41.240> means<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.659> X

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
1 is congruent to 0 mod P means that X

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.120 
1 is congruent to 0 mod P means that X
is<00:01:43.259> congruent<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.189> 1<00:01:44.659> mod<00:01:45.659> P<00:01:45.930> that's<00:01:46.649> an<00:01:46.860> Asif

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
is congruent to 1 mod P that's an Asif

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.120 
is congruent to 1 mod P that's an Asif
right<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:47.460> one<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:47.880> its<00:01:48.030> own<00:01:48.180> inverse<00:01:48.890> next<00:01:49.890> X

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
right so one is its own inverse next X

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.080 
right so one is its own inverse next X
plus<00:01:50.490> 1<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:51.030> going<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.240> grow<00:01:51.390> into<00:01:51.570> 0<00:01:51.780> mod<00:01:52.020> P<00:01:53.090> if

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
plus 1 is going to grow into 0 mod P if

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.410 
plus 1 is going to grow into 0 mod P if
we<00:01:54.299> solve<00:01:54.960> this<00:01:55.200> we<00:01:55.740> get<00:01:55.890> X<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.340> congruent<00:01:56.759> to

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
we solve this we get X is congruent to

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.330 
we solve this we get X is congruent to
negative<00:01:57.840> 1<00:01:58.049> mod<00:01:58.950> P<00:01:59.250> or<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.899> write<00:02:01.140> it

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
negative 1 mod P or to write it

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.469 
negative 1 mod P or to write it
alternatively<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.460> can<00:02:02.549> write<00:02:02.729> this<00:02:02.850> as<00:02:03.060> X<00:02:03.299> is

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
alternatively you can write this as X is

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.289 
alternatively you can write this as X is
congruent<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:03.960> P<00:02:04.229> minus<00:02:04.439> 1<00:02:04.939> mod<00:02:05.939> p

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
congruent to P minus 1 mod p

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:10.650 
congruent to P minus 1 mod p
so<00:02:07.750> one<00:02:08.259> and<00:02:08.590> P<00:02:08.920> minus<00:02:09.069> 1<00:02:09.459> are<00:02:09.670> their<00:02:10.509> own

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
so one and P minus 1 are their own

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.110 
so one and P minus 1 are their own
inverses<00:02:11.349> but<00:02:11.500> every<00:02:12.099> other<00:02:12.250> number<00:02:12.519> mod<00:02:12.849> P

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
inverses but every other number mod P

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.180 
inverses but every other number mod P
can<00:02:13.660> be<00:02:13.780> paired<00:02:14.110> with<00:02:14.349> this<00:02:14.680> inverse<00:02:15.040> and

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
can be paired with this inverse and

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.730 
can be paired with this inverse and
it'll<00:02:15.370> be<00:02:15.489> a<00:02:15.519> different<00:02:15.879> number

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.670 

so<00:02:19.730> now<00:02:19.940> let's<00:02:20.240> go<00:02:20.390> back<00:02:20.420> to<00:02:20.810> P<00:02:21.260> minus<00:02:21.380> 1

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
so now let's go back to P minus 1

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.240 
so now let's go back to P minus 1
factorial<00:02:22.040> so<00:02:22.880> let's<00:02:23.480> take<00:02:23.990> in<00:02:24.200> group<00:02:24.440> 2<00:02:24.800> with

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
factorial so let's take in group 2 with

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.440 
factorial so let's take in group 2 with
its<00:02:25.490> inverse<00:02:26.620> let's<00:02:27.620> group<00:02:27.980> 3<00:02:28.580> with<00:02:29.150> its

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
its inverse let's group 3 with its

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.890 
its inverse let's group 3 with its
inverse<00:02:29.840> and<00:02:30.050> so<00:02:30.740> forth<00:02:31.070> and<00:02:31.720> we'll<00:02:32.720> be<00:02:32.840> able

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
inverse and so forth and we'll be able

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.150 
inverse and so forth and we'll be able
to<00:02:32.990> do<00:02:33.200> this<00:02:33.320> with<00:02:33.500> every<00:02:33.620> number<00:02:33.980> the

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
to do this with every number the

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.480 
to do this with every number the
exceptions<00:02:34.760> being<00:02:35.060> 1<00:02:35.690> and<00:02:36.400> P<00:02:37.400> minus<00:02:37.580> 1<00:02:38.890> now<00:02:39.890> 2

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
exceptions being 1 and P minus 1 now 2

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.690 
exceptions being 1 and P minus 1 now 2
times<00:02:40.790> its<00:02:41.030> inverse<00:02:41.330> is<00:02:41.360> 1<00:02:42.010> 3<00:02:43.010> times<00:02:43.280> this<00:02:43.550> n

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
times its inverse is 1 3 times this n

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.420 
times its inverse is 1 3 times this n
versus<00:02:44.060> 1<00:02:44.240> and<00:02:44.510> so<00:02:44.900> everything<00:02:45.800> cancels<00:02:46.070> out

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
versus 1 and so everything cancels out

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.030 
versus 1 and so everything cancels out
and<00:02:46.460> what<00:02:46.790> we're<00:02:46.970> left<00:02:47.120> with<00:02:47.390> is<00:02:47.440> P<00:02:48.440> minus<00:02:48.830> 1

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
and what we're left with is P minus 1

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.450 
and what we're left with is P minus 1
which<00:02:49.820> as<00:02:50.150> we<00:02:50.450> saw<00:02:50.630> just<00:02:51.230> above<00:02:51.470> is<00:02:51.860> the<00:02:52.250> same

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
which as we saw just above is the same

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.330 
which as we saw just above is the same
thing<00:02:52.730> as<00:02:53.000> negative<00:02:53.360> 1<00:02:53.600> mod<00:02:54.260> p

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.070 

and<00:02:57.660> this<00:02:58.660> proves<00:02:59.019> that<00:02:59.290> P<00:02:59.680> minus<00:02:59.950> 1<00:03:00.190> factorial

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
and this proves that P minus 1 factorial

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:07.170 
and this proves that P minus 1 factorial
Skinner<00:03:02.080> run<00:03:02.319> to<00:03:02.470> negative<00:03:02.769> 1<00:03:02.890> mod<00:03:03.129> p<00:03:03.160> and<00:03:06.180> this

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
Skinner run to negative 1 mod p and this

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.930 
Skinner run to negative 1 mod p and this
is<00:03:07.330> Wilson's<00:03:07.660> theorem
