00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.700
 be informed to civilian marine media 

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:06.620
 thanks thanks 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.879
 how much information today a lot 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.799
 information note that it is not the first 

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:12.079
 time in this program we get some 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:15.049
 video or some photograph of some 

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:17.420
 gadget before the market comes out 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:19.759
 almost always these leaks is called 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.259
 these information leaks are so that 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:23.749
 the device has a little more 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:25.429
 promotion of roads and of expectation and 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:27.619
 you sell more someone tells them over here 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:29.929
 we took the 50 first we took out the box 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.090
 here we take the link to 5 is the first 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:34.120
 We told him I do not have gold and 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.309
 failed and I'm sure that in this one 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:42.289
 we're not going to fail either, it does not take us out 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:46.399
 it's about ipad 5 that this video was snuck 

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:49.670
 in the network is the one on the left is the 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:52.129
 ipad current the one on the right is the ipad 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.129
 mini and the middle one is supposedly 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:58.809
 the ipad 5 because 5 we do not know why 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.809
 because if they continue 4 why 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:09.090
 is a little bit more squared is a 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:12.360
 little bit more zen more skinny this one 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:18.570
 It was already people who are people who live 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:20.150
 where they are whom live 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.070
 fast to the feet 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.070
 it's people who live in themselves 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:35.850
 is the one who is looking for the case 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.850
 how 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.030
 other than it's lighter 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.670
 obviously it is not operational to bring 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.190
 most powerful cameras including the best 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.060
 a more powerful screen we do not know 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:56.220
 when will nothing come out just we 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.700
 has taught the casing that the safest 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.420
 is to go football that does not have flash 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.420
 maybe this other 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.810
 of your tests and vouchers but if you have 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:26.690
 front and back to many users 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.090
 gadgets are expensive and they are 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.680
 difficult to get and make long 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.890
 rows to get them there's a little group 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.530
 of people who row 23 days 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.960
 to buy the most fashionable gadget and what 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.440
 do with him destroy it in front of 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.440
 everyone 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.060
 we love they bought the iphone 5 s 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.040
 and destroy them but this is a small 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:03.310
 capacity test 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.310
 and how much they hold is people who do 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:07.129
 Carlos Valleys 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.269
 apart from leaving plenty of time for 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:15.959
 do the row and money 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:17.999
 as they sell it like this one quickly and 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.519
 then he takes it out to see if it resists the 

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:22.439
 I support other companies like samsung have 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.780
 a specialized department to do 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:27.650
 all kinds of tests for the kids what 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.650
 They make it look like it 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:39.900
 and speaking of this I am going to talk to you 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:42.270
 that yesterday I recorded this for formula and for 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.960
 how he feels the theft of me is going to come out of 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.960
 my honey light 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.590
 we can be sincere apart from trying the 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.750
 resistance and doing crazy things with 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.580
 fashion gadgets what they look for and what 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:05.040
 that everyone searches the networks 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.040
 social are clear visits 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.990
 the point is that people want 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:20.160
 we are not buying this on 4 on 5 the 6 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.160
 from 8 we will never reach it 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.080
 but they do not pay 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:34.470
 in social networks recognition is 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.470
 all 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.449
 but well let's go with you
