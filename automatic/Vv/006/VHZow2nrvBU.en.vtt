get our picture taken with Jamie Roberts
which<00:01:02.789> is<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.030> highlight<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.390> four<00:01:03.690> years<00:01:04.160> and

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
which is the highlight of four years and

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.600 
which is the highlight of four years and
this<00:01:05.250> sort<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.640> accumulation<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:07.310> four<00:01:08.310> years

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
this sort of accumulation of four years

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.570 
this sort of accumulation of four years
add<00:01:08.970> work<00:01:09.270> at<00:01:09.509> Elana<00:01:09.780> so<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.530> couldn't<00:01:11.399> be<00:01:11.550> any

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
add work at Elana so I couldn't be any

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.190 
add work at Elana so I couldn't be any
more<00:01:11.729> pro<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.360> think<00:01:12.750> one<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.020> really

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
more pro I think one of the really

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.080 
more pro I think one of the really
strong<00:01:13.440> things<00:01:13.710> like<00:01:13.890> Cardiff<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.460> but<00:01:14.759> it's

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
strong things like Cardiff is but it's

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.290 
strong things like Cardiff is but it's
not<00:01:15.390> just<00:01:16.070> lectures<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.340> academic<00:01:18.030> it's

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:18.300 
not just lectures and academic it's

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.180 
not just lectures and academic it's
broadened<00:01:18.840> skills<00:01:19.350> further<00:01:19.680> than<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.070> and

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
broadened skills further than that and

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.219 
broadened skills further than that and
also<00:01:20.910> it's<00:01:21.149> a<00:01:21.210> sense<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.509> community<00:01:21.990> but

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
also it's a sense of community but

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.420 
also it's a sense of community but
you're<00:01:22.320> having<00:01:22.530> caught<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.860> but<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.220> don't

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
you're having caught it but you don't

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.130 
you're having caught it but you don't
necessarily<00:01:23.550> get<00:01:24.119> our<00:01:24.420> universities<00:01:24.990> as<00:01:25.110> well

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
necessarily get our universities as well

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.109 
necessarily get our universities as well
the<00:01:25.679> friendliness<00:01:26.099> and<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.459> togetherness

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
the friendliness and the togetherness

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.389 
the friendliness and the togetherness
here<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.539> remarkable<00:01:27.810> given<00:01:28.709> also<00:01:29.099> it's<00:01:29.250> quite

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
here is remarkable given also it's quite

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:31.339 
here is remarkable given also it's quite
big<00:01:29.520> now<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:30.030> it's<00:01:30.179> easier<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.599> be<00:01:30.720> together

00:01:31.339 --> 00:01:31.349 
big now and it's easier to be together

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:33.199 
big now and it's easier to be together
when<00:01:31.649> you're<00:01:31.800> small<00:01:32.009> when<00:01:32.550> you're<00:01:32.670> one<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.119> the

00:01:33.199 --> 00:01:33.209 
when you're small when you're one of the

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:34.730 
when you're small when you're one of the
top<00:01:33.360> competitive<00:01:34.110> departments<00:01:34.619> in<00:01:34.709> the

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
top competitive departments in the

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.529 
top competitive departments in the
country<00:01:34.890> but<00:01:35.759> also<00:01:35.910> still<00:01:36.240> have<00:01:36.450> that

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
country but also still have that

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:37.699 
country but also still have that
together<00:01:36.720> friendly<00:01:37.200> field<00:01:37.349> i<00:01:37.440> think<00:01:37.619> is

00:01:37.699 --> 00:01:37.709 
together friendly field i think is

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:39.199 
together friendly field i think is
really<00:01:37.950> important<00:01:38.340> i<00:01:38.429> think<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.759> placement

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:39.209 
really important i think the placement

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:40.850 
really important i think the placement
year<00:01:39.300> was<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.599> main<00:01:39.780> kind<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.259> what<00:01:40.740> actually

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
year was the main kind of what actually

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.930 
year was the main kind of what actually
drew<00:01:41.190> me<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.640> course<00:01:41.849> because

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
drew me to the course because

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.670 
drew me to the course because
it's<00:01:43.420> so<00:01:43.600> valuable<00:01:43.810> if<00:01:44.260> you're<00:01:44.410> going<00:01:44.500> to<00:01:44.590> do

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
it's so valuable if you're going to do

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.350 
it's so valuable if you're going to do
this<00:01:44.800> close<00:01:45.070> placements<00:01:45.730> probably<00:01:46.090> the<00:01:46.180> best

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
this close placements probably the best

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.870 
this close placements probably the best
thing<00:01:46.480> to<00:01:46.780> do<00:01:46.990> I<00:01:47.230> worked<00:01:47.800> in<00:01:48.100> adult<00:01:48.640> mental
