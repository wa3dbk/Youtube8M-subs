family we got these from a hatchery
called<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.860> McMurray<00:01:11.220> hatchery<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:11.880> we'll

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.649 
show you that information here and a
little<00:01:14.220> bit<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.640> think<00:01:15.060> they<00:01:15.240> were<00:01:15.330> like<00:01:15.479> two

dollars<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.259> 78<00:01:16.650> cents<00:01:16.950> apiece<00:01:17.040> so<00:01:17.340> they're

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
dollars and 78 cents apiece so they're

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.880

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
got a roll of plastic you see the black

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.870 
got a roll of plastic you see the black
plastic<00:03:38.269> here<00:03:38.780> and<00:03:39.010> rather<00:03:40.010> than<00:03:40.250> unfolding

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
plastic here and rather than unfolding

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.340 
plastic here and rather than unfolding
it<00:03:41.000> out<00:03:41.150> to<00:03:41.359> where<00:03:41.510> it's<00:03:41.690> 6<00:03:41.900> feet<00:03:42.109> wide<00:03:42.319> or

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
it out to where it's 6 feet wide or

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.849 
it out to where it's 6 feet wide or
whatever<00:03:42.769> it<00:03:42.889> was<00:03:43.150> it's<00:03:44.150> believed<00:03:44.750> it's<00:03:44.930> five

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:45.859 
whatever it was it's believed it's five

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:48.729 
whatever it was it's believed it's five
mil<00:03:46.130> plastic<00:03:46.370> or<00:03:46.760> formula<00:03:47.290> but<00:03:48.290> we<00:03:48.410> just<00:03:48.560> left

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
mil plastic or formula but we just left

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.949 
mil plastic or formula but we just left
it<00:03:48.920> folded<00:03:49.760> and<00:03:49.970> ran<00:03:50.359> it<00:03:50.510> all<00:03:50.660> the<00:03:50.750> way<00:03:50.840> around

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
it folded and ran it all the way around

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.910 
it folded and ran it all the way around
the<00:03:51.170> bottom<00:03:51.850> to<00:03:52.850> keep<00:03:53.060> our<00:03:53.269> little<00:03:53.450> chicks

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
the bottom to keep our little chicks

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.479 
the bottom to keep our little chicks
away<00:03:54.920> from<00:03:55.130> the<00:03:55.220> bottom<00:03:55.489> part<00:03:55.730> of<00:03:55.940> the<00:03:57.100> of<00:03:58.100> the

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
away from the bottom part of the of the

00:03:58.489 --> 00:03:59.830 
away from the bottom part of the of the
fence<00:03:58.760> so<00:03:59.030> the<00:03:59.150> nothing<00:03:59.389> could<00:03:59.510> reach<00:03:59.630> through

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
fence so the nothing could reach through

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.059 
fence so the nothing could reach through
and<00:03:59.989> get<00:04:00.139> them<00:04:00.260> and<00:04:00.410> we<00:04:00.470> did<00:04:00.620> that<00:04:00.739> all<00:04:00.950> around

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 
and get them and we did that all around

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.960 
and get them and we did that all around
the<00:04:01.310> pen<00:04:01.660> peepers<00:04:03.549> but<00:04:04.549> they<00:04:04.700> are<00:04:04.819> definitely

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
the pen peepers but they are definitely

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.750 
the pen peepers but they are definitely
getting<00:04:05.299> wilder<00:04:05.930> and<00:04:06.250> they're<00:04:07.250> flying<00:04:07.489> a<00:04:07.639> lot

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
getting wilder and they're flying a lot

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.509 
getting wilder and they're flying a lot
I'm<00:04:08.000> glad<00:04:08.329> we<00:04:08.450> got<00:04:08.480> there<00:04:08.750> the<00:04:08.959> top<00:04:09.140> over<00:04:09.470> it<00:04:09.560> we

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
I'm glad we got there the top over it we

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:12.320 
I'm glad we got there the top over it we
haven't<00:04:10.730> had<00:04:10.819> any<00:04:10.970> more<00:04:11.150> issues

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
haven't had any more issues

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:13.550 
haven't had any more issues
with<00:04:12.660> predators<00:04:12.930> or<00:04:13.230> anything<00:04:13.350> like<00:04:13.500> that

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
with predators or anything like that

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.940 
with predators or anything like that
since<00:04:13.920> we<00:04:14.240> put<00:04:15.240> that<00:04:15.360> plastic<00:04:15.810> on<00:04:15.930> there<00:04:16.140> to

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
since we put that plastic on there to

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.560 
since we put that plastic on there to
keep<00:04:17.160> something<00:04:17.430> from<00:04:17.910> pulling<00:04:18.209> them<00:04:18.330> through

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
keep something from pulling them through

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.039 
keep something from pulling them through
so<00:04:18.930> it's<00:04:19.440> working<00:04:19.860> out<00:04:19.920> pretty<00:04:19.980> good<00:04:20.250> so<00:04:20.370> far

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
so it's working out pretty good so far

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.150 
so it's working out pretty good so far
and<00:04:22.049> like<00:04:22.140> I<00:04:22.230> said<00:04:22.290> they're<00:04:22.560> growing<00:04:22.830> up<00:04:22.980> we've

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
and like I said they're growing up we've

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.230 
and like I said they're growing up we've
got<00:04:23.340> 11<00:04:23.580> left<00:04:25.070> pretty<00:04:26.070> expensive<00:04:26.610> mistake

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
got 11 left pretty expensive mistake

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.730 
got 11 left pretty expensive mistake
that<00:04:27.600> we<00:04:27.720> made<00:04:27.930> you<00:04:28.140> know<00:04:28.200> we<00:04:28.320> can't<00:04:28.500> really

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
that we made you know we can't really

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.890 
that we made you know we can't really
blame<00:04:29.130> that<00:04:29.430> we<00:04:29.550> did<00:04:29.730> set<00:04:30.180> some<00:04:30.330> traps<00:04:30.420> up<00:04:30.750> but

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
blame that we did set some traps up but

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.080 
blame that we did set some traps up but
we<00:04:31.020> did<00:04:31.290> catch<00:04:31.560> you<00:04:32.160> know<00:04:32.250> the<00:04:32.520> Coon<00:04:32.730> and<00:04:33.030> I'm

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
we did catch you know the Coon and I'm

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.280 
we did catch you know the Coon and I'm
not<00:04:33.270> sure<00:04:33.420> that<00:04:33.450> that<00:04:33.600> was<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:33.900> culprit<00:04:34.080> or

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
not sure that that was the culprit or

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.640 
not sure that that was the culprit or
not<00:04:34.470> but<00:04:35.160> we'll<00:04:35.280> keep<00:04:35.430> our<00:04:35.610> trap<00:04:35.850> set<00:04:36.650> you

not but we'll keep our trap set you

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.050 
not but we'll keep our trap set you
can't<00:04:37.860> really<00:04:38.040> blame<00:04:38.220> the<00:04:38.460> Predators<00:04:38.820> that's

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
can't really blame the Predators that's

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.720 
can't really blame the Predators that's
what<00:04:39.210> predators<00:04:39.390> do<00:04:39.780> it<00:04:40.140> was<00:04:40.470> if<00:04:41.100> it's<00:04:41.310> anybody

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
what predators do it was if it's anybody

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.260 
what predators do it was if it's anybody
to<00:04:41.850> blame<00:04:42.020> then<00:04:43.020> it<00:04:43.140> would<00:04:43.230> be<00:04:43.350> me<00:04:43.740> blaming<00:04:44.340> to

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
to blame then it would be me blaming to

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.380 
to blame then it would be me blaming to
blame<00:04:45.510> because<00:04:45.750> I<00:04:46.820> didn't<00:04:47.820> make<00:04:47.910> sure<00:04:48.120> that

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
blame because I didn't make sure that

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.030 
blame because I didn't make sure that
they<00:04:48.540> were<00:04:48.600> completely<00:04:49.080> secure<00:04:49.590> as<00:04:49.740> far<00:04:49.920> as

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
they were completely secure as far as

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.710 
they were completely secure as far as
around<00:04:50.220> the<00:04:50.310> bottom<00:04:50.670> of<00:04:50.820> the<00:04:50.910> the<00:04:50.940> fence<00:04:51.480> goes

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
around the bottom of the the fence goes

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.170 
around the bottom of the the fence goes
which<00:04:51.900> is<00:04:52.020> where<00:04:52.170> they<00:04:52.260> got<00:04:52.440> pulled<00:04:52.650> through

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
which is where they got pulled through

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.160 
which is where they got pulled through
so<00:04:54.180> there<00:04:54.360> you<00:04:54.480> have<00:04:54.510> it<00:04:54.660> there's<00:04:55.020> our

so there you have it there's our
pheasant<00:04:55.530> chick<00:04:55.710> update<00:04:56.070> and<00:04:56.280> what<00:04:56.850> happened

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
pheasant chick update and what happened

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.560 
pheasant chick update and what happened
and<00:04:57.300> what<00:04:57.360> we<00:04:57.540> did<00:04:57.690> to<00:04:57.870> remedy<00:04:58.140> the<00:04:58.320> problem

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
and what we did to remedy the problem

and what we did to remedy the problem
I'm<00:05:00.570> pretty<00:05:00.840> sure<00:05:01.020> I'm<00:05:01.170> feel<00:05:01.350> confident<00:05:01.800> now

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
I'm pretty sure I'm feel confident now

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.310 
I'm pretty sure I'm feel confident now
