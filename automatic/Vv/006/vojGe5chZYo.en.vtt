and I just kind of blend it out with a
brush<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.649> you're<00:00:59.010> good<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.190> go<00:00:59.309> it's<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.760> super

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
brush and you're good to go it's a super

brush and you're good to go it's a super
easy<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.449> look<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.949> don't<00:01:02.160> necessarily

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
easy I look and you don't necessarily

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.340 
easy I look and you don't necessarily
need<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.000> primer<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.420> make<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:03.899> lasts<00:01:04.080> any

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.830 
need a primer to make it lasts any
longer<00:01:04.439> so<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.670> can<00:01:05.850> skip<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.360> primer<00:01:06.570> for

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
longer so you can skip the primer for

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.060 
longer so you can skip the primer for

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
you know it's gonna be sort of the same

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.120 
you know it's gonna be sort of the same
effect<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.020> if<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.500> haven't<00:01:10.799> seen<00:01:10.979> this

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
effect and if you haven't seen this

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.980 
effect and if you haven't seen this
video<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.520> will<00:01:11.790> link<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.240> down<00:01:12.270> below<00:01:12.420> in<00:01:12.960> the

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
video I will link it down below in the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.350 
video I will link it down below in the
bottom<00:01:13.380> bar<00:01:13.530> so<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.790> really<00:01:15.030> quick<00:01:15.150> eye

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
bottom bar so this is a really quick eye

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.600 
bottom bar so this is a really quick eye
look<00:01:15.600> it's<00:01:15.810> not<00:01:15.960> very<00:01:16.229> long-lasting<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:17.460> would

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
look it's not very long-lasting I would

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.780 
look it's not very long-lasting I would
say<00:01:17.880> but<00:01:18.710> it's<00:01:19.710> good<00:01:20.040> if<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.250> want<00:01:20.460> something

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
say but it's good if you want something

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.340 
say but it's good if you want something
quick<00:01:20.970> just<00:01:21.390> for<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.630> couple<00:01:21.840> hours<00:01:22.049> or

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
quick just for a couple hours or

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.499 
quick just for a couple hours or
something<00:01:22.530> like<00:01:22.680> that<00:01:22.830> so<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.610> recommend<00:01:24.390> this

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
something like that so I recommend this

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.910 
something like that so I recommend this
and<00:01:24.750> like<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:24.960> said<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.290> don't<00:01:25.500> really<00:01:25.650> need<00:01:25.830> a

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
and like I said you don't really need a

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.530 
and like I said you don't really need a
primer<00:01:26.189> because<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.729> there's<00:01:27.030> not<00:01:27.180> really<00:01:27.450> a

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
primer because it there's not really a

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.210 
primer because it there's not really a
huge<00:01:27.900> difference<00:01:28.320> using<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.680> primer<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.130> not

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
huge difference using a primer and not

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.340 
huge difference using a primer and not
using<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.549> primer<00:01:29.790> at<00:01:30.270> least<00:01:30.479> on<00:01:30.659> my<00:01:30.689> eyes<00:01:30.990> I
