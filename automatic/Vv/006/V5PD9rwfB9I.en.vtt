find it's indispensable of must-haves it
to<00:00:19.460> in<00:00:20.460> order<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:21.779> finish<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.350> jobs

to in order to to finish the the jobs
that<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.430> do<00:00:24.710> now<00:00:25.710> I'll<00:00:26.220> take<00:00:26.519> you<00:00:26.640> through<00:00:26.670> just

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
that I do now I'll take you through just

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.450 
that I do now I'll take you through just
the<00:00:27.390> first<00:00:27.599> two<00:00:27.900> options<00:00:28.140> there<00:00:28.680> so<00:00:29.310> we'll

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
the first two options there so we'll

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.410 
the first two options there so we'll
skip<00:00:29.699> on<00:00:29.880> tools<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.720> other<00:00:30.990> options<00:00:31.470> because

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:32.420 
skip on tools and other options because

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.569 
skip on tools and other options because
these<00:00:33.420> are<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.170> main<00:00:34.380> reasons<00:00:34.710> you'll<00:00:35.489> be

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
these are the main reasons you'll be

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:36.950 
these are the main reasons you'll be
using<00:00:35.790> it<00:00:36.030> for<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.329> cleaner<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.750> the

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
using it for the cleaner and the

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.100 
using it for the cleaner and the
registry<00:00:37.440> editor<00:00:37.469> or<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.219> registry<00:00:38.700> cleaner

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
registry editor or the registry cleaner

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.780 
registry editor or the registry cleaner
so<00:00:40.110> we'll<00:00:40.290> make<00:00:40.649> sure<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.950> cleaner<00:00:41.219> tab<00:00:41.550> is

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
so we'll make sure the cleaner tab is

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.770 
so we'll make sure the cleaner tab is
selected<00:00:42.620> and<00:00:44.090> you<00:00:45.090> can<00:00:45.239> pretty<00:00:45.390> much<00:00:45.480> leave

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
selected and you can pretty much leave

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.049 
selected and you can pretty much leave
everything<00:00:46.079> at<00:00:46.289> defaults<00:00:46.829> I'll<00:00:47.610> just<00:00:47.789> take

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
everything at defaults I'll just take

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.950 
everything at defaults I'll just take
you<00:00:48.180> through<00:00:48.210> two<00:00:48.629> two<00:00:49.350> here<00:00:49.800> two<00:00:50.100> selections

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
you through two two here two selections

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.920

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
visit a website then you may want to

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.450 
visit a website then you may want to
uncheck<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:10.110> all<00:01:10.799> right<00:01:11.010> but<00:01:11.159> other<00:01:11.250> than

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.340 
you don't really want those cleared out
every<00:01:22.740> time<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.850> run<00:01:24.000> this<00:01:24.270> you'll<00:01:25.229> be

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
every time you run this you'll be

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.429 
every time you run this you'll be
running<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.740> probably<00:01:26.009> once<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.310> week<00:01:27.439> unless

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
running it probably once a week unless

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.530 
running it probably once a week unless
you're<00:01:29.009> selling<00:01:29.400> your<00:01:29.549> computer<00:01:30.030> or<00:01:30.240> you

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
a fresh start okay so leave those

a fresh start okay so leave those
unchecked<00:01:36.290> everything<00:01:37.290> else<00:01:37.500> leave<00:01:38.220> as<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:39.509> is

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
unchecked everything else leave as it is

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.530 
unchecked everything else leave as it is
in<00:01:39.930> default<00:01:40.229> settings<00:01:40.710> there<00:01:41.640> are<00:01:41.670> two<00:01:42.150> in

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
in default settings there are two in

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.600 
in default settings there are two in
advanced<00:01:43.110> settings<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:44.040> I<00:01:44.100> would<00:01:44.340> recommend

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
advanced settings that I would recommend

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.740 
advanced settings that I would recommend
you<00:01:45.090> check<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:46.920> old<00:01:47.130> prefetch<00:01:47.610> data

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
you check and that is old prefetch data

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.370 
you check and that is old prefetch data
ok<00:01:48.750> prefetch<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:50.509> sort<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.600> as<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:51.899> sounds<00:01:52.320> that

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
ok prefetch is sort of as it sounds that

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.700 
ok prefetch is sort of as it sounds that
prefetches<00:01:53.420> program<00:01:54.420> data<00:01:54.689> so<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.439> it's

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
prefetches program data so that it's

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.300 
prefetches program data so that it's
easy<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.750> to<00:01:57.750> load<00:01:57.960> up<00:01:58.200> but<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.950> prefetch

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
easy to to load up but the prefetch

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.660 
easy to to load up but the prefetch
folder<00:01:59.700> gets<00:02:00.170> very<00:02:01.170> big<00:02:01.409> very<00:02:01.649> quick<00:02:01.950> so<00:02:02.579> you

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
folder gets very big very quick so you

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.039 
folder gets very big very quick so you
want<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.000> clear<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.360> out<00:02:03.509> every<00:02:03.630> now<00:02:03.869> and

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
want to clear that out every now and

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.150 
want to clear that out every now and
then<00:02:04.399> and<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.850> ISS<00:02:06.270> log<00:02:06.479> files<00:02:06.780> is<00:02:07.680> not<00:02:08.009> much

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
then and the ISS log files is not much

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.300 
then and the ISS log files is not much
really<00:02:08.489> happening<00:02:09.239> there<00:02:09.420> but<00:02:10.129> it's<00:02:11.129> a<00:02:11.190> good

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
really happening there but it's a good

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.880 
really happening there but it's a good
idea<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.730> keep<00:02:12.000> them<00:02:12.209> clean

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
idea to keep them clean

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.039 
idea to keep them clean
okay<00:02:14.519> so<00:02:14.579> the<00:02:15.150> other<00:02:15.450> one<00:02:15.659> is<00:02:15.810> the

leave at defaults you'll also have your
other<00:02:34.260> applications<00:02:34.530> so<00:02:35.159> if<00:02:35.250> we<00:02:35.310> got

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
other applications so if we got

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.309 
other applications so if we got
Microsoft<00:02:35.939> Office<00:02:36.590> you<00:02:37.590> can<00:02:39.170> check<00:02:40.170> or

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
Microsoft Office you can check or

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.410 
Microsoft Office you can check or
uncheck<00:02:40.549> anything<00:02:41.549> that's<00:02:41.760> selected<00:02:42.239> there

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
uncheck anything that's selected there

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.479 
uncheck anything that's selected there
now<00:02:43.139> there<00:02:43.290> is<00:02:43.409> one<00:02:43.650> that<00:02:43.950> you<00:02:44.099> could<00:02:44.250> possibly

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
now there is one that you could possibly

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.490 
now there is one that you could possibly
check<00:02:45.030> and<00:02:45.209> that<00:02:45.239> is<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.810> Java<00:02:46.170> there<00:02:48.500> unless

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
check and that is the Java there unless

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.670 
check and that is the Java there unless
you<00:02:49.739> are<00:02:49.799> using<00:02:50.250> a<00:02:50.579> lot<00:02:50.879> of<00:02:50.909> Java<00:02:51.359> applets<00:02:51.870> it's

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
you are using a lot of Java applets it's

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.379 
you are using a lot of Java applets it's
not<00:02:53.069> really<00:02:53.340> a<00:02:53.370> good<00:02:53.579> idea<00:02:53.909> to<00:02:54.030> have<00:02:54.150> those

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:54.389 
not really a good idea to have those

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:57.920 
not really a good idea to have those
hanging<00:02:55.139> around<00:02:55.409> on<00:02:55.590> your<00:02:55.709> computer<00:02:56.250> so<00:02:56.870> so<00:02:57.870> I

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
hanging around on your computer so so I

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.750 
hanging around on your computer so so I
probably<00:02:58.169> suggest<00:02:58.650> you<00:02:58.829> do<00:02:58.980> check<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.430> Java

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
probably suggest you do check the Java

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.170 
probably suggest you do check the Java
there<00:03:00.889> okay<00:03:01.889> once<00:03:02.790> you've<00:03:02.939> made<00:03:03.120> your

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
think the record is around about a

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.809 
think the record is around about a
gigabyte<00:03:30.269> of<00:03:30.750> temporary<00:03:31.680> files<00:03:32.010> removed<00:03:32.579> from

their<00:03:33.060> their<00:03:34.019> hard<00:03:34.290> drives<00:03:34.530> they<00:03:34.739> can<00:03:34.949> imagine

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
their their hard drives they can imagine

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:38.659 
their their hard drives they can imagine
what<00:03:36.030> that<00:03:36.060> was<00:03:36.329> doing<00:03:37.129> and<00:03:38.129> how<00:03:38.340> slow<00:03:38.639> that

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:38.669 
what that was doing and how slow that

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:41.649 
what that was doing and how slow that
computer<00:03:39.269> was<00:03:39.389> running<00:03:39.569> because<00:03:40.049> of<00:03:40.199> it<00:03:40.319> so

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:41.659 
computer was running because of it so

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:45.680 
computer was running because of it so
and<00:03:43.190> removing<00:03:44.190> eight<00:03:44.340> gigabyte<00:03:44.819> origin<00:03:45.209> less

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
and removing eight gigabyte origin less

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.509 
and removing eight gigabyte origin less
than<00:03:45.870> that<00:03:46.049> can<00:03:46.650> take<00:03:46.829> a<00:03:46.859> lot<00:03:47.159> longer<00:03:47.310> than

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
than that can take a lot longer than

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.330 
than that can take a lot longer than
four<00:03:48.060> seconds<00:03:48.510> which<00:03:49.290> is<00:03:49.440> what<00:03:49.620> a<00:03:49.650> mine<00:03:50.099> took

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
four seconds which is what a mine took

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.399 
four seconds which is what a mine took
