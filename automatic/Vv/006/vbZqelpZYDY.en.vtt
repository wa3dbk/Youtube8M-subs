about Jim Morrison well it was it just

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.450 
about Jim Morrison well it was it just

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
because it was the first to that shit

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.190 
because it was the first to that shit
was<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.000> was<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.660> because<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:48.960> was<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.170> first

this<00:00:49.590> giant<00:00:50.010> evolutionary<00:00:50.700> breakthrough<00:00:50.940> for

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
this giant evolutionary breakthrough for

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.630 
this giant evolutionary breakthrough for
I<00:00:51.539> think<00:00:51.750> it's<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.930> combination<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.590> number<00:00:53.550> of

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
I think it's a combination of number of

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.490 
I think it's a combination of number of
things<00:00:53.820> one<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.570> lot<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.050> people<00:00:55.320> back

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
things one is that a lot of people back

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.099 
things one is that a lot of people back
then<00:00:55.710> thought<00:00:55.980> their<00:00:56.160> music<00:00:56.610> was<00:00:56.969> counted<00:00:57.930> for

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
then thought their music was counted for

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.599 
then thought their music was counted for
something<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.680> other<00:00:58.859> words<00:00:59.100> they<00:00:59.370> thought

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
something in other words they thought

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:00.830 
something in other words they thought
that<00:00:59.730> their<00:00:59.879> music<00:01:00.149> could<00:01:00.239> actually<00:01:00.390> change

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
that their music could actually change

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.049 
that their music could actually change
something<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.190> lot<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.640> lot<00:01:02.789> of<00:01:02.820> what

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
something and a lot of a lot of what

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.640 
something and a lot of a lot of what
happens<00:01:03.390> with<00:01:03.539> artists<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:03.960> cynicism

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
happens with artists is cynicism

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.370 
happens with artists is cynicism
at<00:01:04.860> times<00:01:05.280> have<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.729> certain<00:01:06.060> cynical<00:01:06.659> stamp<00:01:07.140> on

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
at times have a certain cynical stamp on

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.690 
at times have a certain cynical stamp on
them<00:01:07.560> now<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:07.920> think<00:01:08.130> we've<00:01:08.250> been<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.430> very

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
them now I think we've been a very

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.820 
them now I think we've been a very
cynical<00:01:09.060> time<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.810> notion<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.290> nothing<00:01:10.619> you

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
cynical time the notion that nothing you

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.140 
cynical time the notion that nothing you
do<00:01:11.070> as<00:01:11.189> an<00:01:11.280> individual<00:01:11.670> certainly<00:01:11.909> as<00:01:12.090> an

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
do as an individual certainly as an

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.370 
do as an individual certainly as an
artist<00:01:12.360> could<00:01:12.450> change<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.810> anything<00:01:13.170> at<00:01:13.260> all

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
artist could change you anything at all

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.499 
artist could change you anything at all
that's<00:01:14.100> very<00:01:14.430> prevalent<00:01:14.700> among<00:01:15.090> artists<00:01:15.390> so

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
that's very prevalent among artists so

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.820 
that's very prevalent among artists so
you<00:01:15.600> don't<00:01:15.780> have<00:01:15.900> people<00:01:16.110> who<00:01:16.290> are<00:01:16.530> doing

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
you don't have people who are doing

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.590 
you don't have people who are doing
stand-up<00:01:17.310> for<00:01:17.369> example<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.850> try<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.030> break<00:01:18.390> a

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
stand-up for example to try to break a

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.929 
stand-up for example to try to break a
social<00:01:19.140> norm<00:01:19.259> or<00:01:19.470> shatter<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.920> social<00:01:20.340> norm<00:01:20.580> you

social norm or shatter a social norm you

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:21.950 
social norm or shatter a social norm you
certainly<00:01:21.270> don't<00:01:21.390> have<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.630> lot<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.810> musicians

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
certainly don't have a lot of musicians

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.109 
certainly don't have a lot of musicians
saying<00:01:22.500> my<00:01:23.100> music<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.580> actually<00:01:23.939> going<00:01:24.030> to

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
saying my music is actually going to

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.429 
saying my music is actually going to
influence<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.600> political<00:01:24.900> atmosphere

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
influence the political atmosphere

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.890 
influence the political atmosphere

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
remember it was after we had been

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.600 
remember it was after we had been
through<00:01:28.110> in<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.350> 70s<00:01:28.799> we've<00:01:28.950> just<00:01:29.400> been

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
there is a third world war i think was

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.729 
there is a third world war i think was
Einstein<00:02:09.810> who<00:02:09.840> said<00:02:09.929> he<00:02:10.229> said<00:02:10.410> I<00:02:10.440> don't<00:02:10.530> know

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
Einstein who said he said I don't know

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.170 
Einstein who said he said I don't know
what's<00:02:10.920> gonna<00:02:11.009> start<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.489> third<00:02:11.700> world<00:02:11.940> war

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
what's gonna start the third world war

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.640 
what's gonna start the third world war
what<00:02:12.450> weapons<00:02:12.750> will<00:02:12.870> be<00:02:12.900> used<00:02:13.110> but<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.410> fourth

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
what weapons will be used but the fourth

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.320 
what weapons will be used but the fourth
world<00:02:13.860> war<00:02:14.099> already<00:02:14.370> fought<00:02:14.580> with<00:02:14.730> sticks<00:02:14.819> but

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
world war already fought with sticks but

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.820 
world war already fought with sticks but
the<00:02:15.390> point<00:02:15.690> is<00:02:15.780> that<00:02:15.810> I<00:02:16.050> think<00:02:16.349> when<00:02:16.530> you<00:02:16.620> live

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
the point is that I think when you live

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.979 
the point is that I think when you live
in<00:02:16.980> in<00:02:17.220> times<00:02:17.760> of<00:02:17.910> great<00:02:18.120> uncertainty<00:02:18.300> and

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
in in times of great uncertainty and

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.589 
in in times of great uncertainty and
times<00:02:19.650> of<00:02:19.920> great<00:02:20.130> hope<00:02:20.459> and<00:02:20.700> times<00:02:21.239> of<00:02:21.390> great

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
times of great hope and times of great

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.390 
times of great hope and times of great
violence<00:02:21.930> remember<00:02:22.620> in<00:02:22.769> this<00:02:22.920> country<00:02:23.250> we'd

violence remember in this country we'd

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.009 
violence remember in this country we'd
