00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
usually just pay 250 or 300 coins on all

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.260 
usually just pay 250 or 300 coins on all
these<00:01:08.070> pays<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.490> don't<00:01:08.640> really<00:01:08.729> want<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.060> bid

over to the coins and that is just

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.469 
over to the coins and that is just
because<00:01:11.400> sometimes<00:01:11.850> these<00:01:12.090> players<00:01:12.420> don't

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
because sometimes these players don't

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.090 
because sometimes these players don't
sound<00:01:12.930> obviously<00:01:13.470> if<00:01:13.560> it's<00:01:13.710> like<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.860> pretty

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
sound obviously if it's like a pretty

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.010 
sound obviously if it's like a pretty
good<00:01:14.280> player<00:01:14.549> he<00:01:14.760> will<00:01:14.880> sell<00:01:15.180> but<00:01:15.720> if<00:01:15.869> it's

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
good player he will sell but if it's

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.660 
good player he will sell but if it's
like<00:01:16.140> an<00:01:16.259> average<00:01:16.590> player<00:01:16.770> don't<00:01:17.130> bid<00:01:17.340> over

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
like an average player don't bid over

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.390

300<00:01:18.150> coins<00:01:18.270> or<00:01:18.540> even<00:01:19.200> 250<00:01:19.770> points<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.280> my

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
300 coins or even 250 points in my

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.340 
300 coins or even 250 points in my
opinion<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.030> best<00:01:21.060> price<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.900> bidding<00:01:22.140> all

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
opinion is the best price to bidding all

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.469 
opinion is the best price to bidding all
these<00:01:22.560> players<00:01:22.830> like<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:23.189> guy<00:01:23.369> Marion<00:01:24.180> here
