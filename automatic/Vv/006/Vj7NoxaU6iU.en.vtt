00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
and so my list of cons for this lighting

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.010 
and so my list of cons for this lighting
system<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:05.610> it's<00:02:06.060> kind<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:06.299> expensive<00:02:06.630> it

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
system is that it's kind of expensive it

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.639 
system is that it's kind of expensive it
was<00:02:07.079> what<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.590> was<00:02:07.619> like<00:02:07.920> sixty<00:02:08.459> dollars<00:02:08.849> on

amazon i had a gift card so i had to buy

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.390 
amazon i had a gift card so i had to buy
something<00:02:16.310> so<00:02:16.879> this<00:02:17.060> is<00:02:17.209> what<00:02:17.360> I<00:02:17.390> chose<00:02:18.400> but

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
something so this is what I chose but

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.170 
something so this is what I chose but
for<00:02:19.579> sixty<00:02:19.879> dollars<00:02:20.269> it's<00:02:20.510> kind<00:02:20.930> of<00:02:20.959> expensive

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
for sixty dollars it's kind of expensive

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.780 
for sixty dollars it's kind of expensive
it's<00:02:23.180> not<00:02:23.480> as<00:02:23.750> bright<00:02:24.110> as<00:02:24.379> a<00:02:24.409> fluorescent<00:02:25.220> you

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
it's not as bright as a fluorescent you

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.729 
it's not as bright as a fluorescent you
know<00:02:25.909> if<00:02:26.120> you<00:02:26.269> like<00:02:26.450> it<00:02:26.629> nice<00:02:26.930> and<00:02:27.170> bright<00:02:27.409> this

know if you like it nice and bright this

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.099 
know if you like it nice and bright this
probably<00:02:28.129> isn't<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.609> light<00:02:28.849> for<00:02:29.090> you<00:02:29.209> this

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:30.109 
probably isn't the light for you this

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:31.929 
probably isn't the light for you this
little<00:02:30.349> darker<00:02:30.799> actually<00:02:31.220> but<00:02:31.459> it's<00:02:31.609> a<00:02:31.730> little

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:31.939 
little darker actually but it's a little

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:36.490 
little darker actually but it's a little
softer<00:02:32.390> light<00:02:34.060> another<00:02:35.060> card<00:02:35.480> is<00:02:35.780> that<00:02:36.019> you

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
softer light another card is that you

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:43.569 
softer light another card is that you
know<00:02:36.590> these<00:02:36.739> loop<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:38.510> legs<00:02:38.810> that<00:02:40.359> know<00:02:42.579> for

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
know these loop the legs that know for

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:45.819 
know these loop the legs that know for
this<00:02:43.700> for<00:02:44.299> the<00:02:44.389> lighting<00:02:44.629> system<00:02:45.260> are<00:02:45.530> kind<00:02:45.799> of

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829 
this for the lighting system are kind of

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:49.180 
this for the lighting system are kind of
hard<00:02:45.980> to<00:02:46.069> pull<00:02:46.280> out<00:02:46.459> and<00:02:47.379> and<00:02:48.379> if<00:02:48.680> you<00:02:48.799> can<00:02:48.980> see

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
hard to pull out and and if you can see

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.240 
hard to pull out and and if you can see
really<00:02:49.370> close<00:02:50.590> you<00:02:51.590> can<00:02:51.739> have<00:02:51.889> the<00:02:52.010> legs

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
really close you can have the legs

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.990 
really close you can have the legs
inside<00:02:52.849> the<00:02:52.909> glass<00:02:53.269> canopy<00:02:53.750> there<00:02:54.109> but<00:02:54.730> if<00:02:55.730> you

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
inside the glass canopy there but if you

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.660 
inside the glass canopy there but if you
if<00:02:56.299> you<00:02:56.420> have<00:02:56.599> it<00:02:56.780> in<00:02:56.870> there<00:02:58.180> it<00:02:59.180> just<00:03:00.670> won't

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
if you have it in there it just won't

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.899 
if you have it in there it just won't
really<00:03:02.030> line<00:03:02.450> up<00:03:02.480> perfectly<00:03:03.549> so<00:03:04.549> that's<00:03:04.730> why<00:03:04.849> i

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:04.909 
really line up perfectly so that's why i

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:07.229 
really line up perfectly so that's why i
have<00:03:05.030> it<00:03:05.150> set<00:03:05.180> up<00:03:05.359> like<00:03:05.480> that<00:03:05.750> on<00:03:06.139> the<00:03:06.349> edges

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
have it set up like that on the edges

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:13.629 
have it set up like that on the edges
there<00:03:08.859> and<00:03:09.859> another<00:03:10.220> con<00:03:10.700> is<00:03:11.120> that<00:03:12.489> you<00:03:13.489> know<00:03:13.579> i

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:13.639 
there and another con is that you know i

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:15.309 
there and another con is that you know i
have<00:03:13.819> the<00:03:13.940> black<00:03:14.180> i<00:03:14.359> have<00:03:14.540> the<00:03:14.660> glass<00:03:14.900> canopy

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
have the black i have the glass canopy

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.030 
have the black i have the glass canopy
which<00:03:15.829> this<00:03:16.459> black<00:03:17.000> strip<00:03:17.359> right<00:03:17.540> here<00:03:17.569> might

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
which this black strip right here might

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.170 
which this black strip right here might
black<00:03:19.040> some<00:03:19.340> of<00:03:19.430> the<00:03:19.519> light<00:03:19.730> i<00:03:19.760> don't<00:03:20.120> know

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
black some of the light i don't know

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.210 
black some of the light i don't know
what<00:03:20.449> kind<00:03:20.629> of<00:03:20.690> you<00:03:20.930> could<00:03:21.620> you<00:03:21.769> probably<00:03:22.099> use

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
what kind of you could you probably use

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.280 
what kind of you could you probably use
it<00:03:22.419> you<00:03:23.419> can<00:03:23.540> probably<00:03:23.690> take<00:03:23.900> this<00:03:24.019> glass

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
it you can probably take this glass

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.349 
it you can probably take this glass
canopy<00:03:24.680> off<00:03:24.919> but<00:03:25.250> i<00:03:25.280> mean<00:03:25.549> i<00:03:25.760> would<00:03:26.060> just<00:03:26.180> have

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359 
canopy off but i mean i would just have

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:30.099 
canopy off but i mean i would just have
major<00:03:26.599> evaporation<00:03:27.440> problems<00:03:27.889> and<00:03:28.959> let's<00:03:29.959> see

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
major evaporation problems and let's see

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:34.330 
major evaporation problems and let's see
a<00:03:30.139> little<00:03:30.409> wrap<00:03:30.829> it<00:03:31.010> up<00:03:31.129> here<00:03:32.949> another<00:03:33.949> con<00:03:34.310> is

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
a little wrap it up here another con is

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.009 
a little wrap it up here another con is
that<00:03:34.669> there's<00:03:35.000> only<00:03:35.120> one<00:03:35.359> switch<00:03:35.629> for<00:03:35.989> the

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
that there's only one switch for the

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:40.300 
that there's only one switch for the
blue<00:03:37.090> light<00:03:38.090> on<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:39.229> on<00:03:39.379> off<00:03:39.650> and<00:03:39.680> the<00:03:40.069> full

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
blue light on the on off and the full

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.780 
blue light on the on off and the full
light<00:03:40.549> so<00:03:41.389> it's<00:03:41.540> only<00:03:41.629> one<00:03:41.900> switch<00:03:42.430> and<00:03:43.430> also

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
light so it's only one switch and also

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.319 
light so it's only one switch and also
the<00:03:44.720> light<00:03:44.900> comes<00:03:45.169> in<00:03:45.319> 18<00:03:45.769> 24<00:03:45.979> and<00:03:46.519> 36<00:03:46.790> inches

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
the light comes in 18 24 and 36 inches

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:55.979 
the light comes in 18 24 and 36 inches
so<00:03:50.329> if<00:03:50.510> you<00:03:50.629> have<00:03:50.810> like<00:03:51.169> a<00:03:51.530> 29<00:03:52.340> gallon<00:03:53.650> with

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
so if you have like a 29 gallon with

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.119 
so if you have like a 29 gallon with
which<00:03:56.989> is<00:03:57.139> 30<00:03:57.409> inches<00:03:57.500> you're<00:03:57.859> going<00:03:57.979> to<00:03:58.040> have

00:03:58.119 --> 00:03:58.129 
which is 30 inches you're going to have

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:00.849 
which is 30 inches you're going to have
to<00:03:58.220> go<00:03:58.370> with<00:03:58.400> the<00:03:59.060> 24<00:03:59.750> inch<00:03:59.780> lighting<00:04:00.590> and<00:04:00.739> then

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859 
to go with the 24 inch lighting and then

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:04.059 
to go with the 24 inch lighting and then
that<00:04:01.760> could<00:04:02.239> potentially<00:04:02.720> leave<00:04:03.440> your<00:04:03.650> tangle

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
that could potentially leave your tangle

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:09.420 
that could potentially leave your tangle
darker<00:04:04.989> so<00:04:05.989> there<00:04:06.949> you<00:04:07.069> have<00:04:07.129> it<00:04:07.250> that's<00:04:07.909> my

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
darker so there you have it that's my

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.869 
darker so there you have it that's my
review<00:04:10.430> of<00:04:10.729> the<00:04:11.180> marineland<00:04:11.510> LED<00:04:12.879> double
