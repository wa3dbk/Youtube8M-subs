00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 very good these ruling we are in 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.509
 minecraft 1.7 point 2 let's see a mod 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.069
 a mod that is very cool as you are 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.070
 looking up here on the right add 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.840
 this kind of radar that I'm already 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.650
 seeing that more than one is going to use the vote 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.869
 for what is not but good no matter the 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.900
 question is that the radar has sound no 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.150
 I know why it sounded at first 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.279
 it sounds like a sonar to say with a 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.830
 shape is the east radar of the 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.630
 someone's movies and it sounds like 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.989
 principle sounded to me it sounds like 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.010
 species sound my plin plin I do not know is a 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.170
 bit weird 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.690
 the closer you are to some of something 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.059
 of what you choose in this case of 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.390
 yes they are enemies or hostile enemies 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.110
 it is becoming keener to me suddenly 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.990
 I stopped working 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.670
 and I've tried everything and I do not just 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.980
 work I do not know why but they do not give me 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.440
 nor the sound of minecraft is a bit 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.050
 weird but good if the same happens to you 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.280
 say of the comments and more than anything 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.410
 to know if I have done something 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.530
 wrong and it turns out that nobody else is wrong 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.920
 I do not know the question with this mode we can 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.540
 detect bugs as you can see when there 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.760
 some bug you see crystal the dot 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.290
 white tells us the distance to which 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.590
 we're 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.250
 is very cool, the truth is a 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.380
 heap 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.150
 the question is, is that why I say 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.490
 that more than one is going to use it for him 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.890
 now what is not supposed to be not 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.310
 can be used but good if we give the 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.810
 here we get the menu you see it good 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.270
 we can turn what is not necessary because 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.870
 it does not sound like a musician and people and here it is 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.850
 teach the hostile objectives teach 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.220
 players and teach neutral I say 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.140
 for teaching players to see if what 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.090
 you are going to use a server on hand 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.520
 younger game of those games the 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.470
 hungry or things like that and it's going to be 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.810
 that you can not not mess up in a mess 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.300
 Now it's my fault but it's pretty 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.140
 pimp is pretty cool the fact of 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.940
 be able to detect 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.800
 for many kisses and if we give ourselves the 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.250
 Clear spin does not come out 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.740
 it's about half in 180 degrees 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.649
 and it's very very well we can change what 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.480
 let's put neutrals 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.430
 and here you do not see the sheep does not come out 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.469
 all 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.980
 but of course if we can players is what 

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:20.890
 that I tell you this way for the players 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.299
 very loyal but good not really 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.310
 will bring nothing more mod 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:26.769
 bring this from here this kind of radar 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.170
 that as you can see is very cool 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:31.450
 with the sound at the beginning I saw it 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.010
 with sun and we like more but good 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.930
 tell me to see in the comments to 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.299
 you are the same as we do not 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.310
 It sounds like it's been weird because 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.870
 beginning yes it sounded but good 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.700
 an interesting way appeared especially 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.430
 because you're supposed to be able to 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.169
 multiplayer and everything then go with 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.840
 be careful but leave now comment the 

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:51.220
 I forget the banner or something because of me 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.049
 but hey this is the engine is a mod 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.840
 that is pretty cool this kind of 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:58.269
 radar that shows us the objectives 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.109
 we want what we said with lacquer we can 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:03.459
 put all this and do not put players 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:05.409
 crazy of the approved in case you do not get the 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.879
 oil but good this is the way I hope 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:09.310
 that you liked tennis 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:11.859
 descriptions for 1.7 point 2 it 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.599
 install with forge there is nothing else 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:19.959
 these and all of them are electric with 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:19.959
 the pile is located to another side 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.320
 yes
