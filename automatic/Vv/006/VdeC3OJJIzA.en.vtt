00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.980 
you
I<00:01:37.860> just<00:01:38.610> started<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.479> really<00:01:39.600> think<00:01:39.720> about

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
I just started to really think about

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.899 
I just started to really think about
animals<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:41.159> didn't<00:01:41.520> want<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.790> eat

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
animals that I didn't want to eat

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.490 
animals that I didn't want to eat
animals<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.630> then<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:42.810> started<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.380> realize

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
animals and then I started to realize

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.550 
animals and then I started to realize
the<00:01:43.860> cruelty<00:01:44.299> to<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.329> animal<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.960> inhumane

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
the cruelty to the animal the inhumane

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.910 
the cruelty to the animal the inhumane
treatment<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:47.430> them<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.909> now<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:49.259> think<00:01:49.409> people

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
treatment of them and now I think people

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.289 
treatment of them and now I think people
are<00:01:50.040> very<00:01:50.070> conscious<00:01:50.640> about<00:01:50.729> their<00:01:51.090> health

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
are very conscious about their health

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.780 
are very conscious about their health
and<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:52.170> know<00:01:52.200> beef<00:01:52.710> has<00:01:52.950> hormones<00:01:53.520> and

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
and you know beef has hormones and

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.300 
and you know beef has hormones and
chickens<00:01:54.119> are<00:01:54.299> trapped<00:01:55.110> in<00:01:55.320> cages<00:01:55.560> not<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.100> just

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
chickens are trapped in cages not I just

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.399 
chickens are trapped in cages not I just
think<00:01:56.490> it's<00:01:56.640> really<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.329> sad<00:01:57.689> situation<00:01:58.380> for

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
think it's really a sad situation for

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.410 
think it's really a sad situation for
the<00:01:58.680> animals<00:01:59.070> are<00:01:59.219> in<00:01:59.250> humanely<00:01:59.759> treated<00:01:59.909> and

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
the animals are in humanely treated and

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.569 
the animals are in humanely treated and
obviously<00:02:01.320> you<00:02:01.530> don't<00:02:01.710> need<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:02.130> for<00:02:02.189> your
