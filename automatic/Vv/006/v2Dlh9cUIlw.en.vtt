00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.300
 be enjoyed 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.370
 the gameplay is typical final fantasy 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.920
 you move on a world map of 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.630
 venue to your visit 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.090
 villages and dungeons and fights 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.250
 predominantly against random appearing 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.720
 opponents important for the offense 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.940
 relevant opponents appear against it 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.550
 always at given places 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.530
 He speaks with innumerable characters 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.330
 you have to collect in shops 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.459
 experiences and will be in the course of the 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.310
 adventure more and more powerful 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.630
 The fighting system is like in the original 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.480
 Turn based, however, was a little 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.130
 optimized for touchscreen operation 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.290
 if the other final fantasy games 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.480
 has played on mobile devices 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.680
 quickly cope generally 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.010
 the touchscreen control works 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.420
 Well, it's not really good 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.489
 intuitive and suffers now and then 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.880
 small delays and lacking 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.880
 precision 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.160
 one of the main new features of final 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.380
 fantasy 6 vs. previous episodes 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.940
 the fact is that you are now the 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.010
 control over all characters 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.080
 The app can take over implementation 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.830
 In addition, some new graphics 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.540
 delight 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.190
 next to the game characters were the 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.960
 backgrounds as well as the upper world 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.700
 modified to include the 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.430
 high resolution touchscreens the 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.970
 not totally stale today 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.770
 Act 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.330
 the discreet modernization of the 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.580
 graphic market not everyone's taste 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.190
 his is by and large though 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:21.380
 succeeded another innovation is that 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.050
 her in final fantasy 6 in comparison to 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.670
 original could also run diagonally and 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.950
 that such a light up of the 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:30.320
 question mark gives if you are 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.120
 a job does not get ahead as well 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.060
 you have some small extra 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.880
 contents of the final fantasy six remakes 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.920
 from 2006 integrated into the app 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.080
 furthermore, us players have the 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.640
 possibility of playing scores in the icloud too 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.080
 move and from there again 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.390
 download 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.180
 so you can be comfortable on several 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.800
 play devices in the album mode you can 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:56.110
 you also key moments of 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.110
 Review history at any time 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:29.850
 my conclusion final fantasy 6 is that 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:32.340
 so far the best final fantasy adventure 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:34.260
 for ios and android though, the 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.890
 Classics also dust here and there 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.080
 recognized 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:39.090
 the game itself is so great 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.770
 that you do not quite care about details 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.110
 contemporary artwork thats something 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.700
 peculiar storage system the one 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.620
 or other tax issues and the 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.910
 can overlook many lyrics 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.400
 you become magical 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:52.140
 story throughout 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:54.930
 atmospheric adventure of a grandiose 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:58.080
 staged game world and a huge 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:00.690
 scope of play massively compensates for one 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.820
 app is the price of 14 euro 49 though 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.860
 not cheap for this you will be with this 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.090
 but also for weeks 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.160
 being busy 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:11.370
 only the soundtrack of nobuo uematsu 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.360
 is fantastic and still worth it today 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.430
 to be heard 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.290
 who does not know the original and only one 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:18.750
 can not do much with roleplaying 

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:20.850
 a final fantasy six does not come 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:23.100
 The title is also in his 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:25.890
 upscale age still better than 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.580
 Many modern role playing games for iOS and 

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.980
 android 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.810
 that was it from me what to say now 

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:33.240
 game writes your opinion to final 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:35.010
