here<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.689> as<00:01:49.049> he<00:01:49.200> continues<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.740> stay<00:01:50.280> forward

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
here and as he continues to stay forward

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.859 
here and as he continues to stay forward
his<00:01:52.220> elbow<00:01:53.220> starts<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.299> move<00:01:54.479> into<00:01:54.659> this

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
his elbow starts to move into this

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.810 
his elbow starts to move into this
retraction<00:01:55.590> here<00:01:55.799> so<00:01:55.979> if<00:01:56.070> y'all<00:01:56.250> draw<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.520> line

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
retraction here so if y'all draw a line

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.020 
retraction here so if y'all draw a line
from<00:01:57.119> his<00:01:57.270> shoulder<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.990> his<00:01:58.979> elbow<00:01:59.490> it's

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
from his shoulder to his elbow it's

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.760 
from his shoulder to his elbow it's
starting<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.509> get<00:02:00.659> behind<00:02:00.810> his<00:02:01.200> back<00:02:01.409> and

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
starting to get behind his back and

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.520 
starting to get behind his back and
because<00:02:02.399> he<00:02:02.549> continually<00:02:03.060> stays<00:02:03.420> forward<00:02:03.780> now

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
because he continually stays forward now

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.280 
because he continually stays forward now
the<00:02:05.159> shoulder<00:02:05.729> hike<00:02:05.969> occurs<00:02:06.420> which<00:02:07.110> you'll

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
the shoulder hike occurs which you'll

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.559 
the shoulder hike occurs which you'll
see<00:02:07.320> in<00:02:07.770> this<00:02:08.160> next<00:02:08.220> couple<00:02:08.879> frames<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.450> can

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
see in this next couple frames you can

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.150 
see in this next couple frames you can
see<00:02:09.720> how<00:02:09.810> his<00:02:09.959> elbow<00:02:10.379> is<00:02:10.440> starting<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.830> pick<00:02:11.039> up

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
see how his elbow is starting to pick up

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.710 
see how his elbow is starting to pick up
his<00:02:11.340> hand<00:02:11.670> here<00:02:12.000> okay

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
his hand here okay

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.260 
his hand here okay
so<00:02:13.110> this<00:02:13.320> is<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.620> shoulder<00:02:13.890> height<00:02:14.190> so<00:02:14.880> really

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
so this is the shoulder height so really

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.930 
so this is the shoulder height so really
he<00:02:15.420> has<00:02:15.630> a<00:02:15.660> combo<00:02:16.410> of<00:02:17.220> some<00:02:17.490> negative

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
he has a combo of some negative

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.820 
he has a combo of some negative
characteristics<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:18.960> involved<00:02:19.470> with<00:02:19.530> arm

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
characteristics and involved with arm

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.400 
characteristics and involved with arm
action<00:02:20.310> that<00:02:20.880> now<00:02:21.090> are<00:02:21.360> going<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.750> directly

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
action that now are going to directly

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.060 
action that now are going to directly
relate<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.510> he<00:02:24.510> BN<00:02:24.810> not<00:02:25.410> it<00:02:25.680> quite<00:02:25.920> as

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
relate to he BN not it quite as

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.820 
relate to he BN not it quite as
efficient<00:02:26.610> in<00:02:26.760> his<00:02:26.970> acceleration<00:02:27.330> okay<00:02:28.230> so

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
efficient in his acceleration okay so

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.590 
efficient in his acceleration okay so
what<00:02:28.980> you'll<00:02:29.160> see<00:02:29.190> is<00:02:29.460> because<00:02:29.610> he<00:02:29.940> delayed<00:02:30.300> so

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
what you'll see is because he delayed so

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.530 
what you'll see is because he delayed so
long<00:02:30.900> with<00:02:31.620> his<00:02:31.800> posture<00:02:32.370> right<00:02:33.060> about<00:02:33.300> now<00:02:33.480> he

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
long with his posture right about now he

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.800 
long with his posture right about now he
needed<00:02:33.990> to<00:02:34.050> start<00:02:34.290> moving<00:02:34.680> upwards<00:02:35.220> with<00:02:35.550> his

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
needed to start moving upwards with his

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.150 
needed to start moving upwards with his
posture<00:02:36.810> to<00:02:36.930> move<00:02:37.110> more<00:02:37.260> upright<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:38.070> in

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
posture to move more upright and in

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.420 
posture to move more upright and in
thoracic<00:02:38.580> extension<00:02:38.940> but<00:02:39.900> he<00:02:39.990> stays<00:02:40.260> down<00:02:40.560> he

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
thoracic extension but he stays down he

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.460 
thoracic extension but he stays down he
shows<00:02:41.700> his<00:02:41.910> retraction<00:02:42.600> he<00:02:42.930> shows<00:02:43.200> up

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
shows his retraction he shows up

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.440 
shows his retraction he shows up
shoulder<00:02:43.830> height<00:02:44.010> so<00:02:44.580> he<00:02:44.760> eventually<00:02:44.850> gets

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
shoulder height so he eventually gets

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.780 
shoulder height so he eventually gets
back<00:02:45.810> here<00:02:46.230> as<00:02:46.350> you<00:02:46.500> can<00:02:46.530> see<00:02:46.709> so<00:02:47.400> you<00:02:47.459> can<00:02:47.610> see

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
back here as you can see so you can see

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.250 
back here as you can see so you can see
how<00:02:47.940> he's<00:02:48.120> moving<00:02:48.150> in<00:02:48.600> that<00:02:48.720> classic

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
how he's moving in that classic

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.350 
how he's moving in that classic
extension<00:02:49.800> he's<00:02:49.920> trying<00:02:50.250> to<00:02:50.370> get<00:02:50.550> back<00:02:50.790> up<00:02:51.120> on

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
extension he's trying to get back up on

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.720 
extension he's trying to get back up on
top<00:02:51.570> of<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:51.810> ball<00:02:52.050> but<00:02:52.830> when<00:02:53.010> he<00:02:53.100> hits<00:02:53.370> here

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
top of the ball but when he hits here

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.130 
top of the ball but when he hits here
his<00:02:54.420> forearm<00:02:55.050> is<00:02:55.380> that<00:02:56.310> you<00:02:56.820> know<00:02:56.940> a<00:02:57.150> 45<00:02:57.870> degree

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
his forearm is that you know a 45 degree

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.080 
his forearm is that you know a 45 degree
position<00:02:58.920> instead<00:02:59.190> of<00:02:59.310> it<00:02:59.430> being<00:02:59.459> completely

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
position instead of it being completely

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.750 
position instead of it being completely
vertical<00:03:00.690> so<00:03:00.900> if<00:03:00.990> you'll<00:03:01.140> notice<00:03:01.350> his<00:03:02.250> forearm

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
vertical so if you'll notice his forearm

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.600 
vertical so if you'll notice his forearm
is<00:03:03.240> slightly<00:03:03.720> offset<00:03:04.140> here<00:03:04.830> where<00:03:05.340> we<00:03:05.490> would

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
is slightly offset here where we would

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.790 
is slightly offset here where we would
want<00:03:05.880> it<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.390> be<00:03:06.540> more<00:03:06.720> vertical<00:03:07.020> behind<00:03:07.620> his

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
want it to be more vertical behind his

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.550 
want it to be more vertical behind his
head<00:03:07.980> with<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.910> baseball<00:03:09.420> being<00:03:09.690> about<00:03:09.990> here

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
head with the baseball being about here

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.760 
head with the baseball being about here
okay<00:03:11.220> now<00:03:11.640> why<00:03:11.850> is<00:03:11.910> this<00:03:12.090> important<00:03:12.750> okay<00:03:13.350> it's

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
okay now why is this important okay it's

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.860 
okay now why is this important okay it's
important<00:03:14.310> because<00:03:14.400> when<00:03:14.850> the<00:03:14.970> foot<00:03:15.330> hits<00:03:15.720> the

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
important because when the foot hits the

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.590 
important because when the foot hits the
one<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:16.980> forces<00:03:17.400> on<00:03:17.550> the<00:03:17.640> shoulder<00:03:18.120> and<00:03:18.269> the

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
one the forces on the shoulder and the

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.930 
one the forces on the shoulder and the
body<00:03:18.780> to<00:03:19.019> be<00:03:19.140> absorbed<00:03:19.650> evenly<00:03:20.220> and<00:03:20.459> allow<00:03:20.880> the

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
body to be absorbed evenly and allow the

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.050 
body to be absorbed evenly and allow the
trunk<00:03:21.540> to<00:03:22.019> accelerate<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.739> arm<00:03:22.920> forward<00:03:23.310> okay

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
trunk to accelerate the arm forward okay

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.090 
trunk to accelerate the arm forward okay
and<00:03:24.300> what<00:03:24.810> you'll<00:03:24.989> notice<00:03:25.019> here<00:03:25.350> in<00:03:25.590> this<00:03:25.709> next

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
and what you'll notice here in this next

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.150 
and what you'll notice here in this next
couple<00:03:26.280> Clips<00:03:27.019> because<00:03:28.019> he's<00:03:28.470> late<00:03:28.769> getting

but<00:03:53.310> he's<00:03:53.459> capable<00:03:53.760> of<00:03:54.090> doing<00:03:54.390> but<00:03:54.900> this<00:03:55.080> is

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
but he's capable of doing but this is

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.800 
but he's capable of doing but this is
all<00:03:55.470> you<00:03:56.040> know<00:03:56.160> indicator<00:03:56.730> of<00:03:56.940> what<00:03:57.269> his<00:03:57.510> arm

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
all you know indicator of what his arm

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.530 
all you know indicator of what his arm
action<00:03:58.290> led<00:03:58.920> to<00:03:59.220> as<00:03:59.489> he<00:04:00.000> started<00:04:00.390> to

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
action led to as he started to

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.810 
action led to as he started to
accelerate<00:04:00.989> okay<00:04:01.769> I'm<00:04:02.310> going<00:04:02.430> to<00:04:02.489> show<00:04:02.549> you<00:04:02.640> a

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
accelerate okay I'm going to show you a

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.949 
accelerate okay I'm going to show you a
quick<00:04:02.970> example<00:04:03.090> here<00:04:03.840> of<00:04:04.940> Koufax<00:04:05.940> okay

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
quick example here of Koufax okay

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.350 
quick example here of Koufax okay
now<00:04:07.350> actually<00:04:08.220> let<00:04:08.310> me<00:04:08.400> revert<00:04:08.730> back<00:04:08.940> really

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
now actually let me revert back really

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.880 
now actually let me revert back really
quickly<00:04:09.720> so<00:04:10.049> I've<00:04:10.170> been<00:04:10.290> reading<00:04:10.620> a<00:04:10.680> lot<00:04:10.860> of

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
quickly so I've been reading a lot of

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.910 
quickly so I've been reading a lot of
literature<00:04:11.400> about<00:04:12.200> analysts<00:04:13.200> and<00:04:13.380> writers

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
literature about analysts and writers

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.080 
literature about analysts and writers
talking<00:04:14.850> about<00:04:15.229> this<00:04:16.229> position<00:04:16.549> okay<00:04:17.549> the

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
talking about this position okay the

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.509 
talking about this position okay the
hooking<00:04:18.600> but<00:04:19.169> no<00:04:19.290> one<00:04:19.440> quite<00:04:19.739> knows<00:04:19.979> exactly

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
hooking but no one quite knows exactly

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.600 
hooking but no one quite knows exactly
what<00:04:20.940> it<00:04:21.060> means<00:04:21.330> in<00:04:21.660> terms<00:04:21.690> of<00:04:22.169> how<00:04:22.470> it<00:04:23.280> creates

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
what it means in terms of how it creates

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.409 
what it means in terms of how it creates
negative<00:04:23.789> arm<00:04:24.180> action<00:04:24.570> if<00:04:24.780> it<00:04:25.140> does

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
negative arm action if it does

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.330 
negative arm action if it does
create<00:04:25.659> negative<00:04:25.840> armed<00:04:26.199> action<00:04:26.590> and<00:04:26.770> what<00:04:27.219> it

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
create negative armed action and what it

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.580 
create negative armed action and what it
really<00:04:27.460> means<00:04:27.610> in<00:04:28.120> the<00:04:28.210> whole<00:04:28.419> essence<00:04:29.169> of<00:04:29.349> the

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
really means in the whole essence of the

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.730 
really means in the whole essence of the
delivery<00:04:30.039> so<00:04:30.550> Tanaka<00:04:31.060> hooks<00:04:31.509> ok<00:04:32.169> behind<00:04:32.530> his

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
delivery so Tanaka hooks ok behind his

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.070 
delivery so Tanaka hooks ok behind his
back<00:04:33.009> but<00:04:33.370> he<00:04:33.669> stays<00:04:34.090> hooked<00:04:34.539> and<00:04:34.749> then<00:04:34.870> lets

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
back but he stays hooked and then lets

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.619 
back but he stays hooked and then lets
his<00:04:35.229> elbow<00:04:35.800> and<00:04:36.099> gets<00:04:36.699> to<00:04:36.849> that<00:04:36.999> shoulder<00:04:37.330> hike

00:04:37.619 --> 00:04:37.629 
his elbow and gets to that shoulder hike

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:39.809 
his elbow and gets to that shoulder hike
ok<00:04:38.259> but<00:04:38.800> he's<00:04:38.919> also<00:04:39.129> doing<00:04:39.460> something

00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:39.819 
ok but he's also doing something

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:41.850 
ok but he's also doing something
drastically<00:04:40.599> different<00:04:41.020> than<00:04:41.289> what<00:04:41.680> you'll

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
drastically different than what you'll

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.110 
drastically different than what you'll
see<00:04:42.069> here<00:04:42.279> of<00:04:42.430> Koufax

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
see here of Koufax

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.420 
see here of Koufax
so<00:04:43.599> Koufax<00:04:44.199> and<00:04:44.499> the<00:04:44.560> reason<00:04:44.800> I<00:04:44.860> provides<00:04:45.249> the

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
so Koufax and the reason I provides the

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.420 
so Koufax and the reason I provides the
example<00:04:45.909> it's<00:04:46.689> hard<00:04:46.990> to<00:04:47.199> see<00:04:47.439> but<00:04:48.039> if<00:04:48.129> you<00:04:48.159> look

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
example it's hard to see but if you look

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.850 
example it's hard to see but if you look
at<00:04:48.610> this<00:04:48.759> little<00:04:49.659> frame<00:04:50.050> here<00:04:50.319> you<00:04:50.439> can<00:04:50.620> see

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
at this little frame here you can see

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.399 
at this little frame here you can see
how<00:04:51.039> his<00:04:51.189> hand<00:04:51.550> he's<00:04:52.150> showcasing<00:04:53.080> the<00:04:53.199> hook

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:53.409 
how his hand he's showcasing the hook

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:57.510 
how his hand he's showcasing the hook
position<00:04:53.650> as<00:04:54.099> well<00:04:54.340> ok<00:04:55.150> but<00:04:56.069> what<00:04:57.069> he<00:04:57.249> does

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
position as well ok but what he does

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.969 
position as well ok but what he does
tremendously<00:04:58.509> better<00:04:58.810> is<00:04:59.110> you've<00:04:59.560> noticed

00:04:59.969 --> 00:04:59.979 
tremendously better is you've noticed

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:01.769 
tremendously better is you've noticed
where<00:05:00.129> his<00:05:00.279> posture<00:05:00.849> is<00:05:00.879> while<00:05:01.300> he<00:05:01.449> hunched

00:05:01.769 --> 00:05:01.779 
where his posture is while he hunched

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:04.610 
where his posture is while he hunched
over<00:05:01.900> slightly<00:05:02.469> forward<00:05:02.949> he<00:05:03.550> starts<00:05:04.029> to<00:05:04.180> move

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
over slightly forward he starts to move

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.879 
over slightly forward he starts to move
upwards<00:05:05.620> way<00:05:06.490> earlier<00:05:07.210> than<00:05:07.449> Tanaka<00:05:07.930> does<00:05:08.289> and

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:08.889 
upwards way earlier than Tanaka does and

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:12.420 
upwards way earlier than Tanaka does and
when<00:05:09.069> his<00:05:09.340> front<00:05:09.729> foot<00:05:10.000> securely<00:05:10.779> hits<00:05:11.710> what

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
when his front foot securely hits what

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.059 
when his front foot securely hits what
do<00:05:12.520> you<00:05:12.610> notice<00:05:12.870> his<00:05:13.870> forearm<00:05:14.409> in<00:05:14.590> his<00:05:14.740> hand

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:15.069 
do you notice his forearm in his hand

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:16.679 
do you notice his forearm in his hand
are<00:05:15.219> completely<00:05:15.699> vertical<00:05:16.180> but<00:05:16.300> here<00:05:16.509> behind

00:05:16.679 --> 00:05:16.689 
are completely vertical but here behind

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:18.929 
are completely vertical but here behind
his<00:05:17.050> head<00:05:17.289> so<00:05:17.860> then<00:05:18.009> as<00:05:18.189> he<00:05:18.430> rotates

00:05:18.929 --> 00:05:18.939 
his head so then as he rotates

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:21.689 
his head so then as he rotates
everything<00:05:19.930> can<00:05:20.139> go<00:05:20.289> together<00:05:20.560> and<00:05:21.430> you<00:05:21.550> don't

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:21.699 
everything can go together and you don't

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:24.749 
everything can go together and you don't
see<00:05:22.060> the<00:05:22.659> head<00:05:22.990> strength<00:05:23.620> off<00:05:23.889> the<00:05:24.279> target

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:24.759 
see the head strength off the target

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:30.390 
see the head strength off the target
like<00:05:25.270> you<00:05:25.419> did<00:05:25.689> with<00:05:26.229> Tanaka<00:05:27.029> here<00:05:28.029> ok<00:05:28.719> so<00:05:29.400> his

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
like you did with Tanaka here ok so his

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.730 
like you did with Tanaka here ok so his
acceleration<00:05:31.300> in<00:05:31.449> terms<00:05:31.479> of<00:05:31.870> his<00:05:32.080> Trump<00:05:32.500> and

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
acceleration in terms of his Trump and

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.890 
acceleration in terms of his Trump and
ultimately<00:05:33.639> where<00:05:33.819> the<00:05:33.939> ball<00:05:34.150> comes<00:05:34.479> out<00:05:34.629> is

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
ultimately where the ball comes out is

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.869 
ultimately where the ball comes out is
going<00:05:35.110> to<00:05:35.199> be<00:05:35.289> drastically<00:05:35.589> altered<00:05:36.370> just

00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:36.879 
going to be drastically altered just

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:38.790 
going to be drastically altered just
because<00:05:37.300> of<00:05:37.389> the<00:05:37.479> position<00:05:37.900> of<00:05:38.020> his<00:05:38.110> arm<00:05:38.409> swing

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
because of the position of his arm swing

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.079 
because of the position of his arm swing
so<00:05:39.370> hopefully<00:05:39.719> long<00:05:40.719> term<00:05:41.460> you<00:05:42.460> know<00:05:42.490> his<00:05:42.759> his

00:05:43.079 --> 00:05:43.089 
so hopefully long term you know his his

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:44.700 
so hopefully long term you know his his
amount<00:05:43.389> of<00:05:43.539> retraction<00:05:44.139> his<00:05:44.259> amount<00:05:44.560> of

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
amount of retraction his amount of

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.920 
amount of retraction his amount of
shoulder<00:05:45.009> height<00:05:45.189> can<00:05:45.430> be<00:05:45.460> toned<00:05:45.879> down<00:05:46.029> and<00:05:46.509> he

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
shoulder height can be toned down and he

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.290
