Korea they've had really good skaters in
the<00:01:48.930> past<00:01:49.140> but<00:01:49.320> nothing<00:01:49.860> like<00:01:50.189> this<00:01:50.250> she

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
the past but nothing like this she

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.539 
the past but nothing like this she
doesn't<00:01:51.420> need<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.659> triple<00:01:52.110> axel<00:01:52.229> as<00:01:52.619> Mao<00:01:53.220> has

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
doesn't need a triple axel as Mao has

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.850 
doesn't need a triple axel as Mao has
malasada<00:01:54.240> has<00:01:54.479> well<00:01:54.899> ironically<00:01:55.320> her

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
malasada has well ironically her

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.920 
malasada has well ironically her
combination<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.640> triple<00:01:56.909> let's<00:01:57.090> triple<00:01:57.630> toe

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
combination the triple let's triple toe

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.170 
combination the triple let's triple toe
combination<00:01:58.619> actually<00:01:59.189> garners<00:01:59.490> more<00:01:59.520> points

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
combination actually garners more points

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.060 
combination actually garners more points
than<00:02:00.240> those<00:02:00.570> triple<00:02:01.079> axel<00:02:01.500> double<00:02:01.890> toe

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
than those triple axel double toe

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.850 
than those triple axel double toe
combinations<00:02:02.820> so<00:02:03.320> you<00:02:04.320> know<00:02:04.409> interesting

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
combinations so you know interesting

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.639 
combinations so you know interesting
analogy<00:02:05.219> there<00:02:05.549> but<00:02:05.880> she<00:02:06.540> does<00:02:06.810> have<00:02:06.840> like

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
analogy there but she does have like

Scott<00:02:07.920> says<00:02:08.190> other<00:02:08.489> qualities<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.119> are

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
Scott says other qualities that are

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.390 
Scott says other qualities that are
beyond<00:02:10.959> the<00:02:11.110> other<00:02:11.230> skaters<00:02:11.530> the<00:02:11.799> speed<00:02:12.159> the

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
beyond the other skaters the speed the

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.300 
beyond the other skaters the speed the
power<00:02:12.640> and<00:02:13.060> you<00:02:13.930> know<00:02:14.019> just<00:02:14.230> overall<00:02:14.799> presence

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
power and you know just overall presence

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.160 
power and you know just overall presence
I<00:02:15.549> think<00:02:15.969> on<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.180> ice<00:02:16.329> is<00:02:16.540> so<00:02:16.659> commanding

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
I think on the ice is so commanding

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.080 
I think on the ice is so commanding
which<00:02:17.500> is<00:02:17.650> not<00:02:17.769> to<00:02:17.829> say<00:02:17.950> that<00:02:18.099> malasada<00:02:18.640> is<00:02:18.909> a

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
which is not to say that malasada is a

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.119 
which is not to say that malasada is a

skater she's from Japan and she's got to
be<00:02:23.530> thinking<00:02:23.620> about<00:02:23.829> her<00:02:24.010> strategy<00:02:24.250> this

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:24.579

barring a mistake right you're laughing
at<00:02:28.870> me<00:02:28.900> it's<00:02:29.319> like<00:02:29.409> your<00:02:29.859> strategies<00:02:30.370> she's

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:30.609 
at me it's like your strategies she's

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:31.949 
at me it's like your strategies she's
the<00:02:30.760> only<00:02:30.879> woman<00:02:31.030> in<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.209> world<00:02:31.390> does<00:02:31.689> triple

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
the only woman in the world does triple

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.929 
the only woman in the world does triple
axel<00:02:32.349> right<00:02:33.010> and<00:02:33.310> she's<00:02:33.459> gonna<00:02:33.579> probably<00:02:33.819> put

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:33.939 
axel right and she's gonna probably put

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:35.699 
axel right and she's gonna probably put
two<00:02:34.239> of<00:02:34.329> them<00:02:34.450> in<00:02:34.510> a<00:02:34.569> long<00:02:34.720> program<00:02:35.200> and<00:02:35.439> it

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
two of them in a long program and it

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.099 
two of them in a long program and it
probably<00:02:36.069> won't<00:02:36.400> be<00:02:36.459> enough<00:02:36.790> mmm<00:02:37.359> because<00:02:37.720> the

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:38.109 
probably won't be enough mmm because the

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:40.199 
probably won't be enough mmm because the
way<00:02:38.319> that<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:39.040> unit<00:02:39.400> sets<00:02:39.579> of<00:02:39.730> her<00:02:39.849> program<00:02:40.120> is

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
way that the unit sets of her program is

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.839 
way that the unit sets of her program is
a<00:02:40.269> beautiful<00:02:40.750> triple<00:02:41.049> axel<00:02:41.639> but<00:02:42.639> you<00:02:42.760> know

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
a beautiful triple axel but you know

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:44.580 
a beautiful triple axel but you know
again<00:02:42.939> it<00:02:43.299> doesn't<00:02:43.599> have<00:02:43.659> that<00:02:43.750> same<00:02:44.079> speed

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
again it doesn't have that same speed

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.009 
again it doesn't have that same speed
and<00:02:44.889> the<00:02:45.040> same<00:02:45.310> flow<00:02:45.700> across<00:02:45.939> the<00:02:46.060> ice<00:02:46.329> it's

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
and the same flow across the ice it's

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:48.929 
and the same flow across the ice it's
amazing<00:02:47.560> skating<00:02:48.189> but<00:02:48.310> when<00:02:48.489> you<00:02:48.579> put<00:02:48.609> them

00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:48.939 
amazing skating but when you put them

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:50.759 
amazing skating but when you put them
side<00:02:49.180> by<00:02:49.209> side<00:02:49.359> and<00:02:49.720> you<00:02:49.780> compare<00:02:50.109> them<00:02:50.260> you

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
side by side and you compare them you

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.199 
side by side and you compare them you
know<00:02:50.889> mouths<00:02:51.310> got<00:02:51.489> to<00:02:51.579> be<00:02:51.639> thinking<00:02:51.730> there's

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
know mouths got to be thinking there's

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:53.610 
know mouths got to be thinking there's
nothing<00:02:52.510> i<00:02:52.599> can<00:02:52.629> do<00:02:52.870> i<00:02:52.900> just<00:02:53.109> gave<00:02:53.470> her

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
nothing i can do i just gave her

nothing i can do i just gave her
everything<00:02:53.980> I<00:02:54.280> had<00:02:54.549> in<00:02:54.819> the<00:02:55.269> short<00:02:55.510> program

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
everything I had in the short program

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.099 
everything I had in the short program
she<00:02:56.530> skated<00:02:56.799> right<00:02:56.919> after<00:02:57.639> me<00:02:57.790> directly<00:02:58.689> after

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109 
she skated right after me directly after

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:00.509 
she skated right after me directly after
me<00:02:59.230> she<00:02:59.409> heard<00:02:59.560> my<00:02:59.709> scores<00:03:00.069> she<00:03:00.250> knew<00:03:00.370> they

were<00:03:00.579> great<00:03:00.879> and<00:03:01.090> she<00:03:01.659> threw<00:03:01.900> it<00:03:01.930> down<00:03:02.290> and

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
were great and she threw it down and
