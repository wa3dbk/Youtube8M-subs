occur and that just is insane to me that

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.030 
occur and that just is insane to me that

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
the game begins beyond this we only have

one ranked playlist now I'm gonna table

that<00:02:10.229> for<00:02:10.410> a<00:02:10.440> second<00:02:10.709> because<00:02:10.739> it<00:02:10.979> doesn't

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
that for a second because it doesn't

will be like and here we are two and a
half<00:02:33.240> months<00:02:33.420> later<00:02:33.750> over<00:02:34.680> ten<00:02:34.860> patch<00:02:35.070> is<00:02:35.280> deep

half months later over ten patch is deep
and<00:02:35.640> we<00:02:36.450> still<00:02:36.690> have<00:02:36.810> not<00:02:36.960> seen<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:38.190> level<00:02:38.550> of

and we still have not seen the level of
Polish<00:02:39.000> that<00:02:39.420> needs<00:02:39.630> to<00:02:39.840> be<00:02:39.960> seen<00:02:40.230> so<00:02:41.010> is<00:02:41.100> it

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
Polish that needs to be seen so is it

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.430 
Polish that needs to be seen so is it
too<00:02:41.340> late<00:02:41.550> for<00:02:42.090> that<00:02:42.120> casual<00:02:42.750> player<00:02:42.960> the

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
too late for that casual player the

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.440 
too late for that casual player the

person who's going to hike our

fans above that elevating it to a
previous<00:02:50.670> level<00:02:51.060> I<00:02:51.210> do<00:02:51.660> believe<00:02:52.020> it<00:02:52.320> is<00:02:52.350> now

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
previous level I do believe it is now

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.740 
previous level I do believe it is now
I'm<00:02:53.370> not<00:02:53.610> going<00:02:53.730> to<00:02:53.820> be<00:02:53.910> negative<00:02:54.120> here<00:02:54.570> and

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
I'm not going to be negative here and

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.020 
I'm not going to be negative here and
just<00:02:55.080> tell<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:55.410> I<00:02:55.560> think<00:02:56.010> 343<00:02:56.580> took<00:02:56.760> our<00:02:56.880> money

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
just tell you I think 343 took our money

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.570 
just tell you I think 343 took our money
and<00:02:57.240> ran<00:02:57.420> with<00:02:57.450> it<00:02:57.630> I<00:02:57.900> really<00:02:58.500> do<00:02:58.650> believe<00:02:58.770> they

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
and ran with it I really do believe they

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.040 
and ran with it I really do believe they
have<00:02:59.730> some<00:02:59.970> of<00:03:00.060> their<00:03:00.150> best<00:03:00.360> engineers

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
have some of their best engineers

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.950 
have some of their best engineers
working<00:03:01.380> on<00:03:01.740> getting<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.670> game<00:03:02.940> working<00:03:03.810> in

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
working on getting the game working in

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.290 
working on getting the game working in
terms<00:03:04.320> of<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.590> multiplier<00:03:05.060> fixing<00:03:06.060> the

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
terms of the multiplier fixing the

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.120 
terms of the multiplier fixing the
multiplayer<00:03:06.720> component<00:03:06.960> I<00:03:07.410> think<00:03:07.800> they<00:03:07.920> bit

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
multiplayer component I think they bit

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.370 
multiplayer component I think they bit
off<00:03:08.160> more<00:03:08.880> than<00:03:08.910> they<00:03:09.120> can<00:03:09.270> chew<00:03:09.480> I<00:03:09.870> think<00:03:10.260> this

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
off more than they can chew I think this

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.310 
off more than they can chew I think this
project<00:03:10.680> was<00:03:11.280> way<00:03:11.700> too<00:03:11.760> ambitious<00:03:12.180> and<00:03:12.780> that

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
project was way too ambitious and that

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.990 
project was way too ambitious and that
the<00:03:13.470> deadline<00:03:14.070> that<00:03:14.310> was<00:03:14.460> set<00:03:14.700> was

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
the deadline that was set was

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.210 
the deadline that was set was
unrealistic<00:03:15.690> it's<00:03:16.530> hard<00:03:16.710> to<00:03:16.770> argue<00:03:16.860> with<00:03:17.070> that

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
unrealistic it's hard to argue with that

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.920 
unrealistic it's hard to argue with that

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370

having that stripped away from us is a

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.850

huge<00:04:09.330> huge<00:04:09.930> cut<00:04:10.230> back<00:04:10.380> doesn't<00:04:10.620> matter

huge huge cut back doesn't matter

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.170 
huge huge cut back doesn't matter
because<00:04:11.160> i<00:04:11.459> don't<00:04:11.610> think<00:04:11.640> the<00:04:11.820> game<00:04:11.970> actually

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
because i don't think the game actually

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.490 
because i don't think the game actually
should<00:04:12.510> have<00:04:12.690> a<00:04:12.720> ranking<00:04:13.050> system<00:04:13.200> in<00:04:13.410> it

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
should have a ranking system in it

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.230 
should have a ranking system in it
there's<00:04:13.680> like<00:04:13.830> i<00:04:13.980> can<00:04:14.280> name<00:04:14.430> right<00:04:14.670> now<00:04:14.790> three

not<00:04:18.720> going<00:04:18.930> to<00:04:18.989> do<00:04:19.140> that<00:04:19.170> I've<00:04:19.470> heard<00:04:19.620> rumors

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:19.770 
not going to do that I've heard rumors

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:21.979 
not going to do that I've heard rumors
of<00:04:20.040> others<00:04:20.340> and<00:04:20.489> if<00:04:21.239> the<00:04:21.419> game<00:04:21.540> function<00:04:21.930> the

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
of others and if the game function the

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.000 
of others and if the game function the
way<00:04:22.020> it<00:04:22.169> was<00:04:22.260> supposed<00:04:22.380> to<00:04:22.650> when<00:04:22.770> it<00:04:22.860> launched

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
way it was supposed to when it launched

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.230 
way it was supposed to when it launched
then<00:04:23.280> it<00:04:23.430> would<00:04:23.550> be<00:04:23.580> a<00:04:23.700> different<00:04:23.880> issue<00:04:24.060> but

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
then it would be a different issue but

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.410 
then it would be a different issue but
I'm<00:04:24.450> just<00:04:24.570> saying<00:04:24.810> when

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:25.420 
I'm just saying when

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.560 
I'm just saying when
halo<00:04:25.660> 5<00:04:25.870> launches<00:04:26.380> if<00:04:27.040> it<00:04:27.400> can<00:04:27.610> have<00:04:27.850> a<00:04:28.060> solid

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
halo 5 launches if it can have a solid

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.190 
halo 5 launches if it can have a solid
day<00:04:29.110> one<00:04:29.470> experience<00:04:30.340> a<00:04:30.550> smooth<00:04:31.390> matchmaking

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
day one experience a smooth matchmaking

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.230 
day one experience a smooth matchmaking
time<00:04:32.470> for<00:04:32.650> the<00:04:32.710> players<00:04:32.920> and<00:04:33.040> number<00:04:33.370> two<00:04:33.520> can

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
time for the players and number two can

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.810 
time for the players and number two can
do<00:04:34.390> a<00:04:34.420> ranked<00:04:35.050> and<00:04:35.170> social<00:04:36.040> distinction<00:04:36.430> I

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
do a ranked and social distinction I

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.910 
do a ranked and social distinction I
think<00:04:37.210> that's<00:04:37.360> all<00:04:37.570> you<00:04:37.810> need<00:04:38.050> to<00:04:38.290> see<00:04:38.440> a<00:04:38.470> surge

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 
think that's all you need to see a surge

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.380 
think that's all you need to see a surge
in<00:04:38.950> numbers<00:04:39.520> I<00:04:39.700> don't<00:04:39.910> think<00:04:39.940> it's<00:04:40.150> a<00:04:40.180> huge

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
in numbers I don't think it's a huge

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.300 
in numbers I don't think it's a huge
shock<00:04:40.720> either<00:04:41.050> that<00:04:41.380> the<00:04:41.710> master<00:04:42.130> chief

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
shock either that the master chief

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.460 
shock either that the master chief
collection<00:04:42.340> will<00:04:43.090> not<00:04:43.300> be<00:04:43.630> this<00:04:43.870> huge<00:04:44.110> surge

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
collection will not be this huge surge

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.200 
collection will not be this huge surge
in<00:04:44.500> numbers<00:04:44.890> I<00:04:45.040> like<00:04:45.280> the<00:04:45.490> fact<00:04:45.640> to<00:04:45.910> this<00:04:46.090> is

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
in numbers I like the fact to this is

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.700 
in numbers I like the fact to this is
all<00:04:46.360> unofficial<00:04:46.570> I<00:04:46.990> don't<00:04:47.380> know<00:04:47.530> any

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
all unofficial I don't know any

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.040 
all unofficial I don't know any
statistics<00:04:48.400> of<00:04:48.580> population<00:04:49.300> but<00:04:49.660> I'd<00:04:49.810> wager

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
statistics of population but I'd wager

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.450 
statistics of population but I'd wager
it's<00:04:50.380> going<00:04:50.530> to<00:04:50.590> be<00:04:50.680> about<00:04:50.770> the<00:04:50.950> same<00:04:51.100> as<00:04:51.250> hela

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
it's going to be about the same as hela

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.490 
it's going to be about the same as hela
for<00:04:51.670> halo<00:04:52.180> 4<00:04:52.390> during<00:04:52.660> this<00:04:52.810> previous<00:04:53.260> summer

for halo 4 during this previous summer

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.550 
for halo 4 during this previous summer
had<00:04:53.860> about<00:04:54.070> 10<00:04:54.520> to<00:04:54.640> 15,000<00:04:55.480> players<00:04:55.660> we<00:04:56.410> have

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
had about 10 to 15,000 players we have

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.050 
had about 10 to 15,000 players we have
no<00:04:56.680> official<00:04:56.950> stats<00:04:57.280> with<00:04:57.490> the<00:04:57.550> master<00:04:57.730> chief

no official stats with the master chief

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.550 
no official stats with the master chief
collection<00:04:58.090> they've<00:04:58.930> not<00:04:59.140> put<00:04:59.440> the

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
collection they've not put the

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.990

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.640 
population numbers in the game I'm
actually<00:05:01.480> thankful<00:05:01.960> for<00:05:02.350> this<00:05:02.440> I<00:05:02.590> think

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
actually thankful for this I think

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.440 
actually thankful for this I think
people<00:05:02.890> put<00:05:03.160> too<00:05:03.310> much<00:05:03.430> emphasis<00:05:03.970> on<00:05:04.120> how<00:05:04.300> many

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
people put too much emphasis on how many

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.420
