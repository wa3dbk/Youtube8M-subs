00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.460 
but you see back into another container
that<00:02:32.410> fills<00:02:32.770> all<00:02:33.130> the<00:02:33.280> air<00:02:33.820> out<00:02:33.850> and<00:02:34.470> including

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
that fills all the air out and including

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.160 
that fills all the air out and including
the<00:02:35.590> refrigerator<00:02:36.220> also<00:02:36.730> so<00:02:37.060> here<00:02:37.960> we<00:02:38.020> go<00:02:38.140> I

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
the refrigerator also so here we go I

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.310 
the refrigerator also so here we go I
think<00:02:38.320> it's<00:02:38.740> almost<00:02:39.600> to<00:02:40.600> the<00:02:40.630> point<00:02:40.750> of<00:02:41.110> where

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
think it's almost to the point of where

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.120 
think it's almost to the point of where
I<00:02:41.350> would<00:02:41.620> usually<00:02:42.300> go<00:02:43.300> ahead<00:02:43.390> and<00:02:43.570> put<00:02:44.100> some<00:02:45.100> in

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
I would usually go ahead and put some in

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.470 
I would usually go ahead and put some in
my<00:02:45.459> hands<00:02:46.090> and<00:02:46.620> then<00:02:47.620> I<00:02:47.650> take<00:02:48.070> in<00:02:48.370> just<00:02:49.180> put<00:02:49.390> it

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
my hands and then I take in just put it

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:56.940 
my hands and then I take in just put it
on<00:02:49.570> my<00:02:49.750> hair<00:02:51.120> from<00:02:52.120> there<00:02:55.230> so<00:02:56.230> that's<00:02:56.260> what<00:02:56.830> it

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
on my hair from there so that's what it

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:04.350 
on my hair from there so that's what it
looks<00:02:57.160> like<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:02.470> I<00:03:02.650> try<00:03:03.010> not<00:03:03.220> to<00:03:03.550> put<00:03:03.880> my<00:03:04.000> hand

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360
