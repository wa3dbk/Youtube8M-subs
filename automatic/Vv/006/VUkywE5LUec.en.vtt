that I have on my channel that's pretty
unique<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:11.310> alphabet<00:01:11.820> randomness<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.479> that

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
unique is alphabet randomness and that

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.050 
unique is alphabet randomness and that
is<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.350> series<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.830> mine<00:01:14.159> we're<00:01:14.549> basically<00:01:14.909> I

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
certain letter and I know it sounds kind

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.030 
certain letter and I know it sounds kind
of<00:01:18.540> dumb<00:01:18.780> just<00:01:18.960> by<00:01:19.140> stating<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.650> like<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:19.890> but

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
of dumb just by stating it like that but

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.960 
of dumb just by stating it like that but
I'll<00:01:20.159> give<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.340> guys<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.490> quick<00:01:20.759> little

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
I'll give you guys a quick little

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.270 
I'll give you guys a quick little
example<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:22.020> for<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.380> first<00:01:22.530> ever<00:01:22.770> alphabet

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
example so for the first ever alphabet

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.530 
example so for the first ever alphabet
randomness<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.820> went<00:01:23.939> something<00:01:24.150> like<00:01:24.240> this

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
randomness it went something like this

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.870 
randomness it went something like this
so<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.229> first<00:01:25.380> first<00:01:26.220> word<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.460> think<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.759> for

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
so the first first word I think of for

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.190 
so the first first word I think of for
the<00:01:26.939> letter<00:01:27.090> A<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.900> then<00:01:27.990> I'd<00:01:28.080> be<00:01:28.170> like

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
the letter A is and then I'd be like

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.870 
the letter A is and then I'd be like
apple<00:01:28.740> or<00:01:28.799> something<00:01:28.950> I'd<00:01:29.220> be<00:01:29.310> like<00:01:29.430> Apple

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
apple or something I'd be like Apple

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.999 
apple or something I'd be like Apple
affects<00:01:30.150> me<00:01:30.299> because<00:01:30.420> one<00:01:31.200> time<00:01:31.350> i<00:01:31.470> poisoned<00:01:31.950> a

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
but it's just stuff like that but

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.399 
but it's just stuff like that but
actually<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.570> most<00:01:42.689> generic<00:01:42.899> thing<00:01:43.170> I've

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
actually the most generic thing I've

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.010 
actually the most generic thing I've
probably<00:01:43.649> got<00:01:43.920> was<00:01:44.130> aunt<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.840> it<00:01:45.840> actually

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
probably got was aunt and it actually
