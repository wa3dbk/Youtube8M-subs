00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 let's make some clear fillings 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.569
 vanilla butter cream for 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.929
 that we're going to preheat the oven to 200 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.090
 degrees and we will need 250 milliliters of 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.599
 125 flour water 100 grams of 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.310
 butter 4 eggs and a pinch of salt 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:20.090
 we started by heating the water with the 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.150
 butter once it starts to boil 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:26.310
 we remove and start to throw flour 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.260
 we will throw flour little by little until 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.109
 that we see that separates from the 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.830
 walls of our pot I insist no longer 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.830
 is on fire 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.780
 we will also incorporate the last bit 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.610
 of salt 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.010
 once it separates from the 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.510
 walls what it tells us is that we 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.590
 we are approaching the moment to start 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.590
 to lay eggs 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.500
 Well, we started throwing an egg 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:56.420
 we toss an egg stir well until 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.910
 that free and once again the 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.980
 compact tohÃ¡ mass we throw the second 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.750
 egg and so little by little until 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.850
 we have our four incorporated 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.330
 eggs once we have incorporated them 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.950
 what we do is put our mixture 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.710
 in a pastry bag put a 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.810
 tube nozzle and start doing veis 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.000
 the little lines of our sheckler is what 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.060
 we will make as fat as we need 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.160
 then e leclerc or so big now what 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.350
 we will put the fire that we have baked 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.899
 forgiveness is at 200 degrees for 15 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.759
 minutes once they are made we leave 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.670
 cool and we just have to open by 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.350
 half and fill as we do 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.789
 we want for a sweet table we're going to 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.289
 fill it and butter cream 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:40.190
 vanilla that this holds up perfectly 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:42.200
 out you see then we throw it all the dough 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.869
 that we want the fat we want and 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.820
 now we just have to put it in 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.009
 chocolate that we will previously have 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.600
 colored as it is a pink table 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.260
 let's color the chocolate color 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.750
 pink we put the chocolate 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.720
 a plate or something flat that we can 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.780
 then join our cycles well and only 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:05.320
 we have to join the cycles and put them 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:08.710
 confetti above you see we put together the 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.360
 top part in the chocolate and what 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.220
 only thing that remains as I say is to put 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.280
 a little confetti and eat the 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:19.140
 delighted I hope you liked it and 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.140
 if you liked to give the little hand
