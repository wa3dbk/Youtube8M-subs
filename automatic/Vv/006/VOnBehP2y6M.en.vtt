00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
case here now initially it could just be

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.209 
case here now initially it could just be
that<00:01:58.020> he<00:01:58.290> was<00:01:58.380> in<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.560> very<00:01:58.680> weakened<00:01:59.070> state

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
that was my initial thought here but

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.990 
that was my initial thought here but
this<00:02:00.869> all<00:02:01.020> changes<00:02:01.590> when<00:02:02.100> he<00:02:02.250> arrives<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.909> the
