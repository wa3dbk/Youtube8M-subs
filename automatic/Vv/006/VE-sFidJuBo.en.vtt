00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.740
 Hi, I'm Mariana and I do not know, but I have not 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.740
 past 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.100
 that suddenly in a book that was just 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.150
 what they needed 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.150
 well. To me, yes 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:25.849
 Well, I tell you that a certain day 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:29.740
 I woke up I went down and there were some books for 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:32.630
 I started reading them and immediately 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.510
 I felt like a certain connection with them 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:38.000
 and I could not let them go, in fact I finished them 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.420
 of reading that same day are very short 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.570
 because they are stories but even if they are 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.690
 short and be stories came to me 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.820
 they arrived of such magnitude that I got scared 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.800
 because because I think I needed to read 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.750
 those words I have here in your two 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.600
 books that are from the Mexican writer 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.629
 Mariana García Luna I had the opportunity 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.590
 to read them and I have to say it's a 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.590
 great writer 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.600
 when I went to the presentation of 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:14.680
 book power of andhra sagra there 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.840
 she was and I was curious to read 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.000
 his books and there was one that called me 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.970
 a lot of attention but for things of the 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.740
 life I did not read it and I did not read it until this 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.750
 moment but hey, he is not going to talk anymore 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.320
 from my best I tell you what the 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:32.560
 books is the first one that I read is frutar 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.860
 I love fruit stories and lovelessness with 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:39.130
 your very word says it are tales of 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:42.190
 love and lack of love but our 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.590
 protagonists of some connection with 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.450
 certain fruit is what distinguishes the 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.360
 story there I ask what is due 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.280
 the title and she says it's because in 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.260
 all the stories the fruits work 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.260
 as symbols intertwine the stories 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:59.710
 unite or disjoin the characters or they 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:02.880
 they provide specific characteristics and 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.969
 Well, that's what happened to me because 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.090
 I still think about those characters I think 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:11.340
 in those stories so beautiful though 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.849
 some great heartbreak certain teeth 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.800
 fascination for them and it makes me laugh a lot 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:18.780
 because this fruit ario says 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.670
 recommends reading so that the heart 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.890
 need is a reflection of everything that 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.190
 we are and what we have once 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.050
 meaning many tell me that's ah 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.989
 Self-improvement is not self-help 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:34.140
 you do not know how I am anymore, I can read a 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.720
 fantasy book and he grabbed it like 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.599
 self-help, that is, it makes me laugh a lot because 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:43.280
 sometimes I learn a lot more from books 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:46.730
 as shadow hunters 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.340
 or harry potter that a book that tells me 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.440
 How to feel happy the next book 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.959
 that's the way I've seen him and he calls me 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.050
 too much attention is tales of the more 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.580
 there to live in the most here is a 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.020
 novel as it says the truth is that the 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.569
 front page caught my attention 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.790
 the colors and everything obviously I do not 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.580
 I knew what it was for nothing just 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.500
 like I imagined but I thought that 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.590
 we were going to have a female protagonist is 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.870
 a name our protagonist simeón is 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.540
 a very simple name that only seeks 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.550
 the answers he says you know that I 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.530
 I want to Tijuana because he wants to go to 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.489
 tijuana we do not know him dear tijuana 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.530
 but unfortunately it does not reach tijuana 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.989
 it reaches only one place and 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.270
 there many things happen to him many times 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:35.660
 we say good 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:38.510
 I want to get to this place but you have 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.830
 to spend a lot of things to get to that 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.510
 place right now I'm talking about that 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.580
 It reminded me a lot of paulo's alchemist 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.000
 coelho is the only book I've read of 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:50.240
 him and he reminded me of that because you have 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 a dream but you can not arrive a day 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:55.520
 for another to that place there is to that to that 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.940
 where you think you belong not 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:01.790
 you have to go through many things for 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.790
 many places for many people like that 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.070
 that the road is too long our 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:10.460
 protagonist in this book I loved it is 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:13.010
 too much fun I could not stop from 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:15.860
 laughing I swear to you is that it has a way 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.609
 so peculiar to speak 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.859
 so I tell you more not 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:23.400
 and if I know that he is very short and in 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.780
 sand but seriously I devoured it because 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.280
 you want to know more I wanted to know what else 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.979
 it happened to him so I'm going and I'm going to 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.830
 tell me how he wants he wants to know 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:34.780
 that an answer of life and he more me 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.199
 can say that those who no longer live 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.759
 those who already lived but not for 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:41.379
 talk to the dead for what is 

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:43.120
 need to talk to the dead not 

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:44.800
 then that is what you are going to 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.840
 discover to read this book well too 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.389
 certain stories because the characters 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.240
 who are in the course of their 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:55.599
 trip they tell him his life then 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:58.180
 this is no no not seriously these books 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:00.340
 they are very good I liked them too much and 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.590
 I recommend them quite a lot 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.930
 points is a Mexican writer the 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.490
 books are very good way he wrote what 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.810
 that I fell in love from the beginning and 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.090
 apart is something different from what 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.680
 I 've always read because I liked it 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.750
 quite is that Simeon just wanted 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.099
 talk to a person not so 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.289
 Tell the one who told you the 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:20.529
 answers of the universe and tell you how 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:22.749
 be happy and how to live life to the fullest 

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:25.959
 and he became so popular in boy that 

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:28.599
 everyone wanted to stand in line and tell them not to 

00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:31.059
 tell them let me tell you how 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:34.179
 how is it that you should live or how was my 

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:36.579
 life and the whole thing then the truth 

00:05:34.179 --> 00:05:39.959
 is that it was a very fun trip 

00:05:36.579 --> 00:05:43.059
 for me it was a very fun trip and 

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:44.859
 lowered I think these books came 

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:48.090
 at the right time right in the 

00:05:44.859 --> 00:05:50.669
 moment when I needed to read it and 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:52.410
 no no I do not want to tell you that he changed me 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:55.380
 life or changed my way of thinking 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:57.389
 not just like they were what I 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.400
 I needed to read in these rare moments 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:03.060
 Sometimes I start reading a book as soon as 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.860
 it comes to me then it was like wow and a lot 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.449
 I was more surprised that he finishes them 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.919
 reading on that day are not books of 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:10.590
 self-help but the words that 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:11.790
 they contain can change your life these 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:15.750
 books are several of the super 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:18.090
 I recommend if you like those stories if 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:20.910
 they like stories if they will be very 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:23.370
 specials something curious is that when 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:26.100
 well this book to me many will know to 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:28.710
 I like fruits then read 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:31.800
 that I was going for fruit was like I do not know 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:35.389
 I wanted to read it but as I tell you what 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.389
 I started reading and it was that 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.310
 and since then I do not want to talk to you much 

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:42.740
 of his books because they really like them 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:45.080
 I say I started reading without knowing anything 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:47.919
 absolutely nothing and I liked them 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.919
 too much then 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.819
 and well that was all for this video 

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:54.289
 I hope you liked it and give it a 

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:56.030
 opportunity of these marine books 

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:57.319
 García Luna and well you know that the 

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:58.490
 I love both of you later in another 

00:06:57.319 --> 00:07:00.610

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.610
 bye
