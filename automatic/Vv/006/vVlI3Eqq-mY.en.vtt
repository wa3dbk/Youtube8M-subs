as<00:01:19.350> well<00:01:19.640> I'd<00:01:20.640> actually<00:01:20.850> got<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.420> painting<00:01:21.780> to

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
as well I'd actually got the painting to

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.800 
as well I'd actually got the painting to
pop<00:01:22.140> down<00:01:22.290> before<00:01:22.770> but<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:22.979> had<00:01:23.159> no<00:01:23.340> idea

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
pop down before but I had no idea

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.749 
pop down before but I had no idea
whether<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:25.049> was<00:01:25.229> part<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.070> egg<00:01:26.280> or<00:01:26.549> how<00:01:26.729> I

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
whether it was part of the egg or how I

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.969 
whether it was part of the egg or how I
even<00:01:27.060> got<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.420> painting<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.840> pop<00:01:28.049> down<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:28.710> I

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
even got the painting to pop down so I

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.890 
even got the painting to pop down so I
think<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.579> was<00:01:29.700> some<00:01:29.850> Spanish<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.659> war
