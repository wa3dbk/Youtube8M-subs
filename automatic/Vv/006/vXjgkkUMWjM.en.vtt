00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
quite extensively in science museums

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.520 
quite extensively in science museums
around<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.510> world<00:00:30.570> specially<00:00:31.170> in<00:00:31.260> Dublin

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
around the world specially in Dublin

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:40.410 
around the world specially in Dublin
continually<00:00:34.530> developing<00:00:35.070> that

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.360 

this<00:00:40.839> is<00:00:40.929> the<00:00:41.050> iCard<00:00:41.410> robot<00:00:41.769> we<00:00:41.920> called<00:00:42.160> Ichi

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
this is the iCard robot we called Ichi

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.169 
this is the iCard robot we called Ichi
you<00:00:42.969> see<00:00:43.149> here<00:00:43.510> so<00:00:44.050> I'm<00:00:44.109> just<00:00:44.379> looking<00:00:44.649> at<00:00:44.739> some

00:00:45.169 --> 00:00:45.179 
you see here so I'm just looking at some

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:48.930 
you see here so I'm just looking at some
shapes<00:00:46.179> and<00:00:46.480> boxes<00:00:46.870> it's<00:00:47.589> learned<00:00:48.489> some<00:00:48.850> of

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
shapes and boxes it's learned some of

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.880 
shapes and boxes it's learned some of
the<00:00:49.030> shapes<00:00:49.239> names<00:00:49.719> of<00:00:50.170> these<00:00:50.289> boxes<00:00:50.710> to

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
the shapes names of these boxes to

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.930 
the shapes names of these boxes to
interaction<00:00:51.579> with<00:00:52.559> human<00:00:53.559> participants<00:00:54.159> that

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
interaction with human participants that

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.130 
interaction with human participants that
we<00:00:55.059> have<00:00:55.149> actually<00:00:55.390> talked<00:00:55.690> in<00:00:55.870> that<00:00:56.019> we

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
we have actually talked in that we

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.920 
we have actually talked in that we
haven't<00:00:56.320> programmed<00:00:56.799> any<00:00:57.039> of<00:00:57.519> the<00:00:58.390> names<00:00:58.600> of

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
haven't programmed any of the names of

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.189 
haven't programmed any of the names of
this<00:00:59.140> this<00:00:59.260> has<00:00:59.440> been<00:00:59.619> just<00:00:59.820> purely<00:01:00.820> from

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
this this has been just purely from

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.979 
this this has been just purely from
learning<00:01:02.199> to<00:01:02.379> interaction<00:01:03.070> with<00:01:03.219> people<00:01:03.460> so

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
learning to interaction with people so

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.300 
learning to interaction with people so
for<00:01:04.989> example<00:01:05.080> astride<00:01:05.590> see<00:01:05.799> if<00:01:05.890> it<00:01:06.009> recognizes

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
for example astride see if it recognizes

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.859 
for example astride see if it recognizes
the<00:01:06.820> usually<00:01:08.220> blue<00:01:09.220> yes<00:01:09.850> they<00:01:10.060> are<00:01:10.299> so<00:01:10.630> it's

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
the usually blue yes they are so it's

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:13.859 
the usually blue yes they are so it's
sir<00:01:11.220> see<00:01:12.220> I<00:01:12.250> kill<00:01:12.550> and<00:01:13.030> now<00:01:13.330> it<00:01:13.479> sort<00:01:13.659> of<00:01:13.720> is

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
sir see I kill and now it sort of is

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:15.570 
sir see I kill and now it sort of is
looking<00:01:14.200> around<00:01:14.380> the<00:01:14.530> tables<00:01:14.950> or<00:01:15.280> seeing

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
looking around the tables or seeing

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.469 
looking around the tables or seeing
things<00:01:15.940> that<00:01:16.060> it's<00:01:16.240> slipping<00:01:17.819> yeah<00:01:18.819> so<00:01:19.210> and

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
things that it's slipping yeah so and

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.100 
things that it's slipping yeah so and
yeah<00:01:20.259> so<00:01:20.470> did<00:01:20.649> you<00:01:20.890> teach<00:01:21.399> you<00:01:21.960> teach<00:01:22.960> you

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
yeah so did you teach you teach you

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
yeah so did you teach you teach you
robot<00:01:23.530> itself<00:01:23.799> the<00:01:23.950> iCard<00:01:24.340> robot<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:26.039> quite<00:01:27.039> an

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
robot itself the iCard robot is quite an

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.639 
robot itself the iCard robot is quite an
advanced<00:01:27.580> machine<00:01:28.149> it<00:01:28.509> has<00:01:28.750> many<00:01:29.110> many<00:01:29.350> ways

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
advanced machine it has many many ways

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:33.180 
advanced machine it has many many ways
of<00:01:30.610> moving<00:01:30.789> it's<00:01:31.450> very<00:01:31.690> very<00:01:32.679> close

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
of moving it's very very close

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.520 
of moving it's very very close
articulation<00:01:34.149> and<00:01:34.299> one<00:01:35.140> of<00:01:35.259> the<00:01:35.319> great<00:01:35.500> things

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
articulation and one of the great things

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.190 
articulation and one of the great things
about<00:01:35.890> it<00:01:36.190> it<00:01:36.310> has<00:01:36.459> a<00:01:36.490> massive<00:01:36.819> Bank<00:01:37.179> of<00:01:37.330> open

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
about it it has a massive Bank of open

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.219 
about it it has a massive Bank of open
source<00:01:38.549> software<00:01:39.549> repositories<00:01:40.420> which<00:01:41.049> we

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
source software repositories which we

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.889 
source software repositories which we
can<00:01:41.409> exploit<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:43.090> so<00:01:43.240> therefore<00:01:43.479> we<00:01:43.690> don't

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
can exploit and so therefore we don't

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:45.719 
can exploit and so therefore we don't
have<00:01:43.990> to<00:01:44.080> develop<00:01:44.319> things<00:01:44.649> from<00:01:44.890> scratch<00:01:45.130> you

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
have to develop things from scratch you

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.380 
have to develop things from scratch you
can<00:01:46.259> use<00:01:47.259> what<00:01:47.500> other<00:01:47.680> people

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
can use what other people

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.520 
can use what other people
developed<00:01:50.390> and<00:01:50.750> of<00:01:50.960> course<00:01:51.110> they<00:01:51.260> can<00:01:51.410> use

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
developed and of course they can use

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.800 
developed and of course they can use
what<00:01:51.710> we've<00:01:51.860> developed<00:01:52.130> as<00:01:52.700> well<00:01:52.940> and<00:01:53.210> move<00:01:53.660> to

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
what we've developed as well and move to

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.170 
what we've developed as well and move to
the<00:01:53.870> state<00:01:54.110> of<00:01:54.140> the<00:01:54.350> art<00:01:54.500> for<00:01:54.710> everyone<00:01:55.180> could

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
the state of the art for everyone could

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.250 
the state of the art for everyone could
you<00:01:56.270> talk<00:01:56.450> me<00:01:56.570> through<00:01:56.780> what<00:01:56.900> we've<00:01:57.020> just<00:01:57.050> seen

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
you talk me through what we've just seen

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.670 
you talk me through what we've just seen
you<00:01:57.590> picked<00:01:57.830> up<00:01:58.010> a<00:01:58.160> box<00:01:58.540> if<00:01:59.540> we<00:01:59.720> actually<00:02:00.320> have

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
you picked up a box if we actually have

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.870 
you picked up a box if we actually have
a<00:02:00.710> look<00:02:00.860> at<00:02:00.920> the<00:02:00.980> boxes<00:02:01.370> there's<00:02:01.580> different

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
a look at the boxes there's different

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.270 
a look at the boxes there's different
shapes<00:02:02.120> and<00:02:02.470> the<00:02:03.470> shape<00:02:03.620> was<00:02:03.710> recognized<00:02:04.160> the

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
shapes and the shape was recognized the

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.040 
shapes and the shape was recognized the
robot<00:02:04.610> said<00:02:04.880> out<00:02:05.000> loud<00:02:05.030> what<00:02:05.540> what<00:02:05.810> we<00:02:05.930> were

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
robot said out loud what what we were

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.830 
robot said out loud what what we were
actually<00:02:06.380> looking<00:02:06.530> at<00:02:07.240> what's<00:02:08.240> that<00:02:08.330> process

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
actually looking at what's that process

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.590 
actually looking at what's that process
then<00:02:09.080> that<00:02:09.259> takes<00:02:09.410> place<00:02:09.649> for<00:02:09.950> the<00:02:10.009> robot<00:02:10.310> to

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
then that takes place for the robot to

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.300 
then that takes place for the robot to
recognize<00:02:11.600> and<00:02:11.780> how's<00:02:12.380> it<00:02:12.560> learn<00:02:12.740> to<00:02:12.920> do<00:02:13.100> that

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
recognize and how's it learn to do that

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.160 
recognize and how's it learn to do that
well<00:02:14.180> it's<00:02:14.330> it<00:02:14.600> works<00:02:16.240> number<00:02:17.240> of<00:02:17.420> stages<00:02:17.660> but

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
well it's it works number of stages but

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.160 
well it's it works number of stages but
at<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.530> early<00:02:18.800> stage<00:02:19.070> the<00:02:19.310> robot<00:02:19.700> and<00:02:20.170> gently

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
at the early stage the robot and gently

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.840 
at the early stage the robot and gently
starts<00:02:21.590> to<00:02:21.680> babble<00:02:22.070> you're<00:02:22.340> not<00:02:22.459> showing<00:02:22.610> you

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
starts to babble you're not showing you

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.970 
starts to babble you're not showing you
that<00:02:23.030> today<00:02:23.360> but<00:02:23.630> it<00:02:23.810> starts<00:02:24.470> to<00:02:24.620> babble<00:02:24.920> and

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
that today but it starts to babble and

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.340 
that today but it starts to babble and
we<00:02:25.550> have<00:02:25.700> people<00:02:26.480> who<00:02:26.600> are<00:02:26.660> not<00:02:26.870> involved<00:02:27.110> in

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
we have people who are not involved in

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.949 
we have people who are not involved in
research<00:02:27.739> come<00:02:28.100> in<00:02:28.280> talk<00:02:29.150> to<00:02:29.300> the<00:02:29.390> robot<00:02:29.480> as<00:02:29.840> if

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
research come in talk to the robot as if

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.979 
research come in talk to the robot as if
it<00:02:30.080> were<00:02:30.170> a<00:02:30.200> child<00:02:30.560> and<00:02:31.010> try<00:02:31.820> to<00:02:31.880> when<00:02:32.750> it<00:02:32.840> when

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
it were a child and try to when it when

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.560 
it were a child and try to when it when
they<00:02:33.110> hear<00:02:33.790> through<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:34.940> babbling<00:02:35.330> that<00:02:35.450> it's

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
they hear through the babbling that it's

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.990 
they hear through the babbling that it's
recognizing<00:02:36.260> serving<00:02:37.040> over<00:02:37.310> can<00:02:37.489> I<00:02:37.580> certain

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
recognizing serving over can I certain

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.330 
recognizing serving over can I certain
sounds<00:02:38.630> which<00:02:38.780> so<00:02:39.290> peculiar<00:02:39.770> to<00:02:39.920> English

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
sounds which so peculiar to English

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.910 
sounds which so peculiar to English
words<00:02:41.180> in<00:02:41.420> English<00:02:41.780> they<00:02:42.500> would<00:02:42.620> give<00:02:42.800> the

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
words in English they would give the

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.620 
words in English they would give the
robot<00:02:43.310> zombie<00:02:43.550> walk<00:02:43.700> or<00:02:43.910> something<00:02:44.000> that<00:02:44.420> well

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
robot zombie walk or something that well

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.750 
robot zombie walk or something that well
done<00:02:44.840> GG<00:02:45.050> or<00:02:45.440> something<00:02:45.830> like<00:02:45.950> that<00:02:46.010> now<00:02:46.640> we

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
done GG or something like that now we

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
done GG or something like that now we
pick<00:02:46.940> that<00:02:47.090> up<00:02:47.120> and<00:02:47.360> use<00:02:47.510> that<00:02:47.540> as<00:02:47.690> a

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
pick that up and use that as a

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.199 
pick that up and use that as a
reinforcing<00:02:48.410> signal<00:02:48.950> to<00:02:49.459> lock<00:02:49.640> those<00:02:49.850> words

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
reinforcing signal to lock those words

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:51.970 
reinforcing signal to lock those words
but<00:02:50.420> those<00:02:50.600> words<00:02:50.870> at<00:02:51.050> that<00:02:51.200> point<00:02:51.470> don't<00:02:51.650> have

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
but those words at that point don't have

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.509 
but those words at that point don't have
any<00:02:52.310> meaning<00:02:53.090> and<00:02:53.959> later<00:02:54.709> on<00:02:54.980> people<00:02:55.220> come

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
any meaning and later on people come

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.060 
any meaning and later on people come
back<00:02:55.820> and<00:02:56.150> then<00:02:56.750> you<00:02:56.900> ask<00:02:57.049> them<00:02:57.260> to<00:02:57.410> teach<00:02:57.650> the

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
back and then you ask them to teach the

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.539 
back and then you ask them to teach the
robot<00:02:58.220> about<00:02:58.700> the<00:02:59.450> shapes<00:02:59.780> and<00:03:00.080> so<00:03:00.799> they<00:03:01.370> would

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
robot about the shapes and so they would

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.850 
robot about the shapes and so they would
they<00:03:01.880> typically<00:03:02.209> sit<00:03:02.510> here<00:03:02.930> and<00:03:03.080> would<00:03:03.709> ask

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
they typically sit here and would ask

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.789 
they typically sit here and would ask
them<00:03:03.980> to<00:03:04.100> say<00:03:04.250> try<00:03:05.120> and<00:03:05.239> teach<00:03:05.390> teach<00:03:05.660> you<00:03:05.870> what

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
them to say try and teach teach you what

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:08.830 
them to say try and teach teach you what
this<00:03:06.980> is<00:03:07.190> and<00:03:07.880> they<00:03:08.030> could<00:03:08.180> use<00:03:08.360> different

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
this is and they could use different

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.140 
this is and they could use different
words<00:03:09.560> for<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.070> same<00:03:10.100> thing<00:03:10.610> so<00:03:10.850> for<00:03:11.060> example

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
words for the same thing so for example

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.479 
words for the same thing so for example
here<00:03:11.540> although<00:03:12.260> dici<00:03:12.500> in<00:03:12.830> previous<00:03:13.280> sessions

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
here although dici in previous sessions

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.060 
here although dici in previous sessions
has<00:03:13.760> been<00:03:13.970> told<00:03:14.180> preserve<00:03:14.570> Kalume<00:03:14.980> seeing<00:03:15.980> a

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
has been told preserve Kalume seeing a

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.810 
has been told preserve Kalume seeing a
circle<00:03:16.459> thing<00:03:16.640> but<00:03:18.280> other<00:03:19.280> people<00:03:19.670> for

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
circle thing but other people for

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.850 
circle thing but other people for
example<00:03:19.910> would<00:03:20.900> say<00:03:21.140> some<00:03:21.410> people<00:03:21.500> to<00:03:21.709> say

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
example would say some people to say

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.560 
example would say some people to say
moon<00:03:22.130> some<00:03:22.459> people<00:03:22.700> would<00:03:22.760> say<00:03:22.820> crescent<00:03:23.390> moon

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
moon some people would say crescent moon

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.330 
moon some people would say crescent moon
and<00:03:23.780> some<00:03:24.260> people<00:03:24.560> would<00:03:24.650> say<00:03:24.709> this<00:03:25.160> is<00:03:25.310> a

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
and some people would say this is a

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.320 
and some people would say this is a
smile<00:03:25.760> and<00:03:26.060> so<00:03:26.780> DG<00:03:27.019> would<00:03:27.350> learn<00:03:28.060> that<00:03:29.060> this<00:03:29.180> is

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
smile and so DG would learn that this is

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.759 
smile and so DG would learn that this is
a<00:03:29.360> smile<00:03:29.780> as<00:03:30.049> well<00:03:30.410> as<00:03:30.530> a<00:03:30.560> moon<00:03:30.830> and<00:03:31.070> so<00:03:32.060> and<00:03:32.840> it

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
a smile as well as a moon and so and it

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.400 
a smile as well as a moon and so and it
looked<00:03:33.980> basically<00:03:34.610> it<00:03:34.730> learns<00:03:34.940> by<00:03:35.410> sharing

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
looked basically it learns by sharing

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.590 
looked basically it learns by sharing
it's<00:03:37.160> a<00:03:37.310> shared<00:03:37.580> context<00:03:38.239> to<00:03:38.299> shared

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
it's a shared context to shared

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.410 
it's a shared context to shared
attention<00:03:39.530> all<00:03:39.620> those<00:03:39.860> with<00:03:40.130> a<00:03:40.190> person<00:03:40.670> did

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
attention all those with a person did

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.160 
attention all those with a person did
she<00:03:41.600> can't<00:03:41.840> learn<00:03:42.049> without<00:03:42.940> that

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
she can't learn without that

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.740 
she can't learn without that
person<00:03:44.590> interacting<00:03:45.520> with<00:03:45.730> it<00:03:45.760> and<00:03:45.910> actually

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
person interacting with it and actually

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.030 
person interacting with it and actually
similarly<00:03:47.470> people<00:03:48.069> find<00:03:48.489> it<00:03:48.610> quite<00:03:48.790> difficult

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
similarly people find it quite difficult

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.800 
similarly people find it quite difficult
not<00:03:51.040> they<00:03:51.520> oh<00:03:52.150> she<00:03:52.209> put<00:03:52.420> the<00:03:52.510> other<00:03:52.630> way<00:03:52.750> they

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
not they oh she put the other way they

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.600 
not they oh she put the other way they
find<00:03:53.050> it<00:03:53.140> quite<00:03:53.260> easy<00:03:53.560> to<00:03:53.800> interact<00:03:54.250> with<00:03:54.370> each

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
find it quite easy to interact with each

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.309 
find it quite easy to interact with each
to<00:03:54.849> me<00:03:54.910> because<00:03:55.060> of<00:03:55.209> its<00:03:55.450> embodiment<00:03:56.050> because

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
to me because of its embodiment because

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.339 
to me because of its embodiment because
it<00:03:56.440> has<00:03:57.280> a<00:03:57.310> human-like<00:03:57.880> embodiment<00:03:58.300> and<00:03:58.750> quite

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
it has a human-like embodiment and quite

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:01.500 
it has a human-like embodiment and quite
a<00:03:59.380> cute<00:03:59.680> low<00:03:59.920> bar<00:04:00.130> I<00:04:00.250> made<00:04:00.430> they<00:04:01.030> react<00:04:01.300> to<00:04:01.330> it

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
a cute low bar I made they react to it

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.080 
a cute low bar I made they react to it
