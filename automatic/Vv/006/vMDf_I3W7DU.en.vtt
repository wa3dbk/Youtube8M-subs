00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
which it is available in the market so

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.760 
which it is available in the market so
that's<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.700> nice<00:01:51.479> device<00:01:51.869> according<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.409> n2<00:01:52.680> to

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
that's a nice device according to n2 to

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.039 
that's a nice device according to n2 to
benchmark<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.579> can<00:01:53.759> handle<00:01:53.970> most<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.869> your

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
daily needs task and applications so let

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.690 
daily needs task and applications so let
me<00:01:57.930> just<00:01:58.049> close<00:01:58.320> this<00:01:58.590> one<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:59.070> move<00:01:59.310> on<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.610> a

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
me just close this one and move on to a

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.980 
me just close this one and move on to a
second<00:02:00.210> test<00:02:00.420> which<00:02:00.960> would<00:02:01.229> be<00:02:02.990> quadrant

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
second test which would be quadrant

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.350 
second test which would be quadrant
standard<00:02:04.049> so<00:02:04.920> here<00:02:05.369> is<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.549> second<00:02:05.909> test<00:02:06.060> and

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
standard so here is the second test and

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.600 
standard so here is the second test and
we<00:02:06.600> would<00:02:06.719> be<00:02:06.869> running<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.140> full<00:02:07.829> benchmark<00:02:08.399> on

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
we would be running a full benchmark on

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.600 
we would be running a full benchmark on
the<00:02:09.030> device<00:02:09.360> so<00:02:10.170> let's<00:02:10.440> see<00:02:10.590> what<00:02:11.310> is<00:02:11.459> the

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
the device so let's see what is the

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.520 
the device so let's see what is the
score<00:02:11.849> that<00:02:12.090> this<00:02:12.239> device<00:02:12.510> is<00:02:12.660> able<00:02:12.810> to

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
score that this device is able to

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.180 
score that this device is able to
get<00:02:14.040> in<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.459> quadrant<00:02:14.940> standard<00:02:15.090> test<00:02:16.190> so

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
get in the quadrant standard test so

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.120 
get in the quadrant standard test so
here<00:02:17.670> is<00:02:17.819> the<00:02:17.970> score<00:02:18.240> a<00:02:18.590> device<00:02:19.590> has<00:02:19.830> caught

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
here is the score a device has caught

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.370 
here is the score a device has caught
13,000<00:02:21.319> 191<00:02:22.319> in<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:23.040> quadrant<00:02:23.490> standard<00:02:23.640> test

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.780 
13,000 191 in the quadrant standard test
currently<00:02:25.380> it<00:02:25.470> is<00:02:25.560> displaying<00:02:26.280> there<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:26.640> is

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
currently it is displaying there it is

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.670 
currently it is displaying there it is
at<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.060> top<00:02:27.270> because<00:02:27.450> most<00:02:28.200> of<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.530> other

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
at the top because most of the other

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.680 
at the top because most of the other
devices<00:02:28.950> is<00:02:29.340> not<00:02:29.550> included<00:02:29.940> in<00:02:30.150> this<00:02:30.360> bar

from other lands score somewhere around
59<00:03:25.500> to<00:03:26.040> 60<00:03:26.450> so<00:03:27.450> it's<00:03:27.630> a<00:03:27.810> pretty<00:03:27.989> powerful

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
59 to 60 so it's a pretty powerful

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.310
