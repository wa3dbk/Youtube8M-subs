00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:11.759
 hello you love how it is now 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.740
 my teams decided to go with it 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.240
 studs to decorate and in this video 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.619
 Here I just want to show as I do 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.180
 the did or 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.920
 maybe one or the other of 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.630
 to inspire yourself 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.000
 to make one's lord so the first thing 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.010
 Of course, you never need her 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.210
 I have mine from statista.com but me 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.929
 lose by the again in the 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.350
 infobox 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.149
 tasted the pack with 520 euro and 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.160
 in addition you still sent ten euros 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.930
 and so look for my closer 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.180
 out and the only thing they do then 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.800
 You just have to go through the fabric first 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.670
 sting and then the two tips 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.670
 to deal with inside 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.440
 besides, you also need of course 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.510
 still with the suitable object with 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.640
 he can make the rent around because of it 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.020
 with slightly extremely hard in the fingers 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.970
 after about ten minutes anyway 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.200
 start to hurt and i have myself 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.610
 then decided for the knife because it 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.020
 just worked the best 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.350
 actually gets to go with aging and 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.030
 use object 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.860
 I also have another share 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.270
 Back this steel taught here what 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.190
 it's just practical if we are not 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.810
 but only plastic bags must grab 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.890
 That's just a small tip system 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.090
 let alone 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.280
 the next step is, so to speak 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.110
 to prepare the share so that it is good 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.880
 Working in the case is easy 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.470
 means that it spreads for you and 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.590
 the shoulders of wanted work 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.390
 still work strokes that should be a 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.170
 circus look like that and yes I would 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.970
 tell me it's nevertheless actually 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.340
 nothing more can just get started 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.780
 lay 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.670
 I started sewing at the seams 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.470
 long plus or cross to 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.330
 sting and have always been before 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.520
 think about how big the area you are in 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.830
 the final result with rivets decorated be about 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.240
 should 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.229
 yes and if you want that easy 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.229
 sting straight on 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.200
 he just turns his jacket over 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.450
 take your masters and have them 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.940
 next to it the two points that through the 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.409
 penalty room in order to best this way 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.250
 firm as possible because it stops there 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:10.190
 of course better and that's how it looks now 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.570
 my first little riveting series 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.900
 so when you're done, you have time 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:19.890
 a line from the upper respiratory tract 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:23.280
 and led and the next the cutlery 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.960
 animals, so to speak, the second near that 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.720
 in the end this blues arises 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.060
 and then you do it the whole way 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.960
 say makes a circle that 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:37.290
 looks like that then, so to speak, the 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.640
 circle down to the end and the 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.580
 last step is because easy 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:45.240
 to fill this circle and jan 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.490
 they like actually already done so 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:51.270
 so look like our finished cross plus 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:53.010
 circle out almost like zivis sign and that 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.950
 only thing that has to do now is 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.990
 the four corners that were created there 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.750
 to fill up with rivets best 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.040
 just as evenly as possible so 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.590
 the first can I now ever 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.690
 Of course , we did not quite make it 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.420
 equally successful but I have myself 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.100
 strives and in the end it will be 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.690
 not even if it's a few millimeters 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.970
 It's over there that the others are 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.980
 also really difficult to find poverty 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.760
 that's how it looks in any case 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.760
 result 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.180
 hmm 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.800
 that means in any case you mean 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.090
 at video 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.129
 I hope you liked it 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.870
 maybe a bit inspired and 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:00.970
 a great inspiration for my video 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.069
 on the one hand was the brand of agad fries 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.390
 and on the other hand crash led the one 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.310
 my favorite youtuber gutters 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.080
 has become and I link their 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.310
 Kanal and her video in the infobox 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.630
 because they stop by again 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.560
 Thanks for watching and I hope we 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.560
 see you soon
