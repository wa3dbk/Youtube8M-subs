 near potential third base 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.469
 zerg here is a turn 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.480

 fool on st and no 9 pylon 9 battle and 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.780
 Apparently the second battle is the same on the ninth 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.820
 limit this super early battle and this 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.039
 very early battle and true rode 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.859
 to sort out but went somewhere 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.930
 not there in my opinion he is somewhere not at all 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:05.850
 There went on 5 visible very nag 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:08.070

 where should this practice be and chili 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.020
 who is going to put the pipes 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.420
 really right here in the area of ​​3 bases 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.700
 protoss 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.020
 is it really just a proxy cat here 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.100
 now put true 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.470
 this is a turn this is a turn you don't 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.900
 just imagine what can now 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.630
 be play 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.370
 you can not imagine the gentlemen that now 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.410
 can happen in this idea I am you now 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.810

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.880
 really got late but 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.840
 Now think about this scenario, the pool is not 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:54.560
 I know how somehow miraculously completed 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:59.110
 true lays 2 sankin his proxy 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.340
 even though and then leaves with all the drones 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.290
 drives left up and starts there 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.840
 get the only thing you need in order 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.830
 to this scenario is realized is 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:12.740
 to reach the pool if the floor is completed 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.470
 the morning will be just a crazy chance for 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.720
 to bring this game into something 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.720
 the most incredible and you know the floor 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.580
 you really need to complete true 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.620
 will be just there to have time 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.290
 line up a few drones and all 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.300
 drones can go but not now not 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.640
 now because it can be destroyed 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.640
 pools may not have time to leave the body 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.650

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.810

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.180

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.340

 There is a sledge , after all, the morning the clever mirror 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.230

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.530
 put in such a way so that not from here 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.140
 could go make a very competent move 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.150

 become just incredible just 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.460
 unforgettable at the moment when the corpse 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:14.120
 I went to put a proxy hut against two 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:16.220
 I warned you about your practice 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.900
 this scenario and we saw the most 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:21.020
 true fiction 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:25.750

 last hit points of the last unit 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:32.210
