00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
to get from a target from a beginning to

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.299 
to get from a target from a beginning to
a<00:00:39.930> target<00:00:40.379> there's<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.620> beginning<00:00:40.980> and

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
a target there's the beginning and

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.889 
a target there's the beginning and
there's<00:00:41.790> your<00:00:41.940> target<00:00:42.120> you've<00:00:42.510> got<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.690> get<00:00:42.780> to

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
there's your target you've got to get to

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.630 
there's your target you've got to get to
that<00:00:43.020> piece<00:00:43.230> as<00:00:43.770> you<00:00:43.980> come<00:00:44.129> up<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.340> streets

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
that piece as you come up the streets

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.549 
that piece as you come up the streets
you<00:00:45.000> reach<00:00:45.149> your<00:00:45.180> dead<00:00:45.450> end<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:46.170> can't

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
you reach your dead end so that can't

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.020 
you reach your dead end so that can't
happen<00:00:46.710> you're<00:00:46.950> gonna<00:00:47.129> take<00:00:47.730> one<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:47.940> these

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
happen you're gonna take one of these

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.520 
happen you're gonna take one of these
pieces<00:00:48.239> here<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.629> go<00:00:48.750> around<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.110> corner<00:00:49.440> and

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
pieces here and go around the corner and

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.020 
pieces here and go around the corner and
now<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.219> hit<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.610> target

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
now you hit the target

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.970 
now you hit the target
so<00:00:51.420> that's<00:00:51.600> finished<00:00:52.199> make<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.890> more

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
so that's finished make it more

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.200 
so that's finished make it more
difficult<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.399> can<00:00:53.550> put<00:00:53.670> another<00:00:53.879> one<00:00:53.969> over

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
difficult you can put another one over

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.180 
difficult you can put another one over
here<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:54.899> now<00:00:55.410> you've<00:00:55.530> got<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.739> go<00:00:55.860> on<00:00:56.010> from

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
here and now you've got to go on from

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.979 
here and now you've got to go on from
that<00:00:56.280> target<00:00:56.550> round<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.120> corner<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.600> perhaps

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
that target round the corner to perhaps

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.380 
that target round the corner to perhaps
another<00:00:58.800> one<00:00:59.100> when<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.640> reach<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.910> curve<00:01:00.149> but

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
another one when you reach the curve but

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.639 
another one when you reach the curve but
here<00:01:00.660> are<00:01:00.809> allowed<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.109> go<00:01:01.199> around<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.500> curve

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
here are allowed to go around the curve

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.049 
here are allowed to go around the curve
without<00:01:02.010> one<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.219> these<00:01:02.340> pieces<00:01:02.579> which<00:01:02.940> is

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
without one of these pieces which is

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.609 
without one of these pieces which is
interesting<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.660> then<00:01:04.170> we've<00:01:04.290> got<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.530> have

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
interesting and then we've got to have

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:05.810 
interesting and then we've got to have
another<00:01:04.830> piece<00:01:05.010> like<00:01:05.220> this<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.580> take<00:01:05.729> us

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
another piece like this to take us

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.880 
another piece like this to take us
across<00:01:05.909> here<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.869> think<00:01:07.320> we'll<00:01:07.680> have<00:01:07.770> to

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
across here and I think we'll have to

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.950 
across here and I think we'll have to
have<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.040> zigzag<00:01:08.520> some<00:01:08.880> down<00:01:09.090> down<00:01:09.479> there<00:01:09.720> to

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
have a zigzag some down down there to

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.870 
have a zigzag some down down there to
get<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.439> second<00:01:10.710> target<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.250> it's<00:01:11.460> an

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
get it to the second target so it's an

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.609 
get it to the second target so it's an
ongoing<00:01:12.060> zine<00:01:12.600> which<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:12.960> won't<00:01:13.229> show<00:01:13.409> anymore

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
ongoing zine which I won't show anymore

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.280 
ongoing zine which I won't show anymore
but<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.010> idea<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.430> make<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.119> multi-level<00:01:15.840> or

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
but the idea is to make a multi-level or

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.560 
but the idea is to make a multi-level or
puzzles<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.040> this<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.850> easy<00:01:18.030> book<00:01:18.299> looks

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
puzzles and this is the easy book looks

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.060 
puzzles and this is the easy book looks
this<00:01:18.900> seems<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.259> be<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.380> more<00:01:19.530> difficult<00:01:19.740> one

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
this seems to be the more difficult one

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.859 
this seems to be the more difficult one
which<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.640> much<00:01:20.820> more<00:01:21.000> advanced<00:01:21.390> puzzles<00:01:21.750> in

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
which is much more advanced puzzles in

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.679 
which is much more advanced puzzles in
it<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:23.030> interesting<00:01:24.030> in<00:01:24.119> both<00:01:24.270> books<00:01:24.509> that

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689
