little large radiolucent areas or I

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.970 
little large radiolucent areas or I
should<00:00:35.489> say<00:00:35.640> radiopaque<00:00:36.149> areas<00:00:36.750> on<00:00:37.020> our<00:00:37.079> films

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
should say radiopaque areas on our films

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.190 
should say radiopaque areas on our films
and<00:00:38.250> these<00:00:38.489> are<00:00:38.760> actually<00:00:39.239> that<00:00:39.450> extra<00:00:39.899> bony

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
growth that is actually what a Torah is

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.830 
growth that is actually what a Torah is
and<00:00:43.500> it's<00:00:44.160> projected<00:00:44.670> on<00:00:44.789> your<00:00:44.969> film<00:00:45.270> as<00:00:45.510> a

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
little bit more dense area so you won't

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.880 
little bit more dense area so you won't
be<00:00:48.300> able<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.600> eliminate<00:00:49.050> this<00:00:49.260> at<00:00:49.500> all

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
but you have to be able to get the x-ray

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.410 
but you have to be able to get the x-ray
in<00:00:54.629> there<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:55.280> get<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.520> images<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.210> teeth

in there to get the images of the teeth

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.299 
in there to get the images of the teeth
that<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.719> need<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.260> this<00:00:58.620> can<00:00:58.829> be<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:58.980> problem

too large bumps there that can cause a

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.800 
too large bumps there that can cause a
problem<00:01:13.740> when<00:01:14.130> putting<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.549> x-ray<00:01:14.880> into<00:01:15.689> the

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
problem when putting the x-ray into the

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.359 
problem when putting the x-ray into the
mouth<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.350> we'll<00:01:16.530> show<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.770> some<00:01:17.159> techniques

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
and not on them so this piece here is

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.670 
and not on them so this piece here is
going<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.299> really<00:01:30.600> be<00:01:30.750> set<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.170> little<00:01:31.470> bit

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
going to really be set a little bit

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.859 
going to really be set a little bit
farther<00:01:31.920> back<00:01:32.090> depending<00:01:33.090> on<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.600> size

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
farther back depending on the the size

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.399 
farther back depending on the the size
of<00:01:34.439> those<00:01:34.619> large<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.939> gross<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.600> once<00:01:37.290> you

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
of those large and gross and once you

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.950 
of those large and gross and once you
get<00:01:37.590> behind<00:01:37.770> them<00:01:38.340> raise<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.390> bar<00:01:39.570> up<00:01:39.780> and

then have them gently bite down and this
won't<00:01:42.840> cause<00:01:43.170> any<00:01:43.200> pain<00:01:43.680> or<00:01:43.890> anything<00:01:44.070> but

just<00:01:49.829> putting<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.399> behind<00:01:50.780> them<00:01:51.780> instead<00:01:52.140> of

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
just putting it behind them instead of

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.830 
just putting it behind them instead of
on<00:01:52.350> top<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.799> them<00:01:53.270> it<00:01:54.270> makes<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.630> lot<00:01:54.810> more

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
on top of them it makes a lot more

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.679 
on top of them it makes a lot more
comfortable<00:01:55.350> on<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.950> patient's<00:01:56.399> mouth<00:01:56.689> notice

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
comfortable on a patient's mouth notice

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.990 
comfortable on a patient's mouth notice
I<00:01:57.810> did<00:01:58.110> have<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.290> size<00:01:58.530> 1<00:01:58.860> film<00:01:59.159> he<00:01:59.490> is<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.640> little

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
I did have a size 1 film he is a little

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.600 
I did have a size 1 film he is a little
narrower<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.689> depending<00:02:01.649> on<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.950> shape<00:02:02.340> of

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
narrower and depending on the shape of

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.999 
narrower and depending on the shape of
the<00:02:03.060> dental<00:02:03.659> arch<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:04.320> can<00:02:04.350> either<00:02:04.740> use<00:02:04.979> a

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
the dental arch you can either use a

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.540 
the dental arch you can either use a
size<00:02:05.340> 1<00:02:05.670> or<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:05.939> size<00:02:06.390> 2<00:02:07.069> the<00:02:08.069> offices<00:02:08.520> that

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
size 1 or a size 2 the offices that

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.839 
size 1 or a size 2 the offices that
don't<00:02:08.970> use<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.690> ring<00:02:10.370> instrument<00:02:11.370> but<00:02:11.730> they

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
don't use the ring instrument but they

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.890 
don't use the ring instrument but they
do<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.270> bisecting<00:02:12.900> angle<00:02:14.000> can<00:02:15.000> actually<00:02:15.390> get

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
do the bisecting angle can actually get

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.410 
do the bisecting angle can actually get
some<00:02:16.080> nice<00:02:16.230> films<00:02:16.620> with<00:02:16.800> Tori<00:02:17.099> also<00:02:17.550> so<00:02:18.270> what<00:02:18.360> I

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
some nice films with Tori also so what I

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.330 
some nice films with Tori also so what I
did<00:02:18.599> is<00:02:18.720> I'm<00:02:18.870> using<00:02:19.170> this<00:02:19.410> type<00:02:19.680> with<00:02:19.920> the

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
did is I'm using this type with the

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.930 
did is I'm using this type with the
slant<00:02:20.700> of<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:22.110> bite<00:02:22.590> block<00:02:22.739> where<00:02:23.370> it<00:02:23.520> places

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
slant of the bite block where it places

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.030 
slant of the bite block where it places
the<00:02:24.060> film<00:02:24.270> on<00:02:24.420> a<00:02:24.599> slant<00:02:24.900> instead<00:02:25.410> of<00:02:25.590> straight

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
the film on a slant instead of straight

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.010 
the film on a slant instead of straight
it<00:02:26.340> doesn't<00:02:26.670> matter<00:02:27.030> which<00:02:27.239> type<00:02:27.780> you<00:02:27.840> have

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
it doesn't matter which type you have

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.860 
it doesn't matter which type you have
they<00:02:28.440> both<00:02:28.560> work<00:02:28.860> really<00:02:29.099> nice<00:02:29.370> so<00:02:30.209> again<00:02:30.480> the

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
they both work really nice so again the

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.259 
they both work really nice so again the
bottom<00:02:31.170> edge<00:02:31.379> is<00:02:31.769> going<00:02:32.129> to<00:02:32.250> go<00:02:32.459> behind<00:02:32.670> those

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
bottom edge is going to go behind those

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.520 
bottom edge is going to go behind those
two<00:02:33.510> bumps<00:02:33.900> so<00:02:34.050> you're<00:02:34.170> going<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:34.319> put<00:02:34.440> it

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
two bumps so you're going to put it

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.100 
two bumps so you're going to put it
really<00:02:34.860> far<00:02:35.220> back<00:02:35.459> raise<00:02:36.300> it<00:02:36.330> up<00:02:36.629> before<00:02:37.080> he

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
really far back raise it up before he

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.100 
really far back raise it up before he
bites<00:02:37.470> down<00:02:37.769> together<00:02:38.239> you<00:02:39.239> can<00:02:39.390> see<00:02:39.569> if<00:02:39.690> this

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
bites down together you can see if this

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.410 
bites down together you can see if this
actual<00:02:40.860> piece<00:02:41.099> works<00:02:41.430> so<00:02:41.670> nice<00:02:41.910> because<00:02:42.300> the

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
actual piece works so nice because the

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.809 
actual piece works so nice because the
bike<00:02:42.569> lock<00:02:42.810> is<00:02:43.019> actually<00:02:43.379> thicker<00:02:43.680> and<00:02:44.040> it

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
bike lock is actually thicker and it

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.550 
bike lock is actually thicker and it
takes<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.629> place<00:02:45.780> of<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:46.080> cotton<00:02:46.440> roll

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
takes the place of a cotton roll

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.259 
takes the place of a cotton roll
actually<00:02:47.099> that<00:02:47.370> you<00:02:47.760> don't<00:02:47.940> you<00:02:48.150> can

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
actually that you don't you can

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.479 
actually that you don't you can
eliminate<00:02:48.480> that<00:02:48.870> step<00:02:49.349> I'm<00:02:50.010> gonna<00:02:50.099> turn<00:02:50.370> them

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
eliminate that step I'm gonna turn them

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.839 
eliminate that step I'm gonna turn them
to<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.640> side<00:02:50.730> a<00:02:50.970> little<00:02:51.180> bit<00:02:52.220> by<00:02:53.220> doing<00:02:53.250> so

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
to the side a little bit by doing so

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:55.729 
to the side a little bit by doing so
this<00:02:54.120> film<00:02:54.450> right<00:02:54.660> now<00:02:54.810> is<00:02:55.019> placed<00:02:55.379> on<00:02:55.620> an

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
this film right now is placed on an

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.119 
this film right now is placed on an
angle<00:02:56.129> about<00:02:56.340> so<00:02:56.760> if<00:02:57.420> we<00:02:58.170> don't<00:02:58.409> have<00:02:58.650> our<00:02:58.680> ring

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
angle about so if we don't have our ring

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.220 
angle about so if we don't have our ring
and<00:02:59.310> bar<00:02:59.489> to<00:02:59.909> guide<00:03:00.120> our<00:03:00.330> vertical<00:03:00.690> tube<00:03:01.050> angle

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
and bar to guide our vertical tube angle

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.309 
and bar to guide our vertical tube angle
we<00:03:01.980> have<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.370> now<00:03:02.519> set<00:03:02.909> our<00:03:03.030> own<00:03:03.300> so<00:03:03.629> how<00:03:03.870> much

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
we have to now set our own so how much

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.009 
we have to now set our own so how much
do<00:03:04.680> we<00:03:04.760> angle<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.819> tube<00:03:06.090> in<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.569> up<00:03:06.690> and<00:03:06.870> down

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
do we angle the tube in the up and down

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.440 
do we angle the tube in the up and down
motion<00:03:07.290> so<00:03:07.830> we<00:03:07.860> do<00:03:08.220> not<00:03:08.400> get<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:08.970> elongation

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
motion so we do not get the elongation

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.170 
motion so we do not get the elongation
or<00:03:09.720> foreshortening<00:03:10.260> on<00:03:10.530> those<00:03:10.709> teeth<00:03:10.950> if<00:03:11.489> you

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
or foreshortening on those teeth if you

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.110 
or foreshortening on those teeth if you
actually<00:03:12.390> foul<00:03:13.019> this<00:03:13.560> actual<00:03:14.159> bite<00:03:14.909> block

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
actually foul this actual bite block

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.960 
actually foul this actual bite block
here<00:03:15.659> with<00:03:16.170> your<00:03:16.349> x-ray<00:03:16.769> cone<00:03:17.250> you'll<00:03:17.610> be<00:03:17.760> able

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
here with your x-ray cone you'll be able

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.449 
here with your x-ray cone you'll be able
to<00:03:18.209> really<00:03:18.690> get<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.440> correct<00:03:19.739> tube<00:03:19.980> angle

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
to really get the correct tube angle

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.330 
to really get the correct tube angle
because<00:03:21.180> this<00:03:21.510> is<00:03:21.780> set<00:03:22.260> in<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.650> relationship

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
because this is set in the relationship

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.360 
because this is set in the relationship
of<00:03:23.519> the<00:03:23.780> angle<00:03:24.780> of<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:25.049> film<00:03:25.440> that's<00:03:25.709> in<00:03:26.010> the

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
of the angle of the film that's in the

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.490 
of the angle of the film that's in the
mouth<00:03:26.549> right<00:03:26.879> now<00:03:27.180> so<00:03:27.599> what<00:03:27.720> I'm<00:03:27.840> going<00:03:28.110> to<00:03:28.170> do

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
mouth right now so what I'm going to do

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.680 
mouth right now so what I'm going to do
is<00:03:29.750> bring<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:31.290> cone<00:03:31.790> line<00:03:32.790> up<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.150> top<00:03:33.420> edge

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
is bring the cone line up the top edge

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.839 
is bring the cone line up the top edge
of<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:34.019> cone<00:03:34.290> so<00:03:34.650> it's<00:03:34.830> running<00:03:35.250> in<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.580> same

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
of the cone so it's running in the same

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.259 
of the cone so it's running in the same
line<00:03:36.269> that<00:03:36.599> this<00:03:37.260> actual<00:03:37.860> bite<00:03:38.790> block<00:03:39.000> is

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
line that this actual bite block is

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.649 
line that this actual bite block is
running<00:03:39.690> so<00:03:39.989> I<00:03:40.230> think<00:03:41.010> is<00:03:41.819> it<00:03:42.000> just<00:03:42.209> about<00:03:42.420> like

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:42.659 
running so I think is it just about like

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:44.390 
running so I think is it just about like
so<00:03:43.080> and<00:03:43.349> that's<00:03:43.500> about<00:03:43.769> how<00:03:43.890> much<00:03:44.040> vertical

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
so and that's about how much vertical

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.339 
so and that's about how much vertical
tube<00:03:44.760> angle<00:03:45.090> I<00:03:45.209> am<00:03:45.299> actually<00:03:45.480> going<00:03:45.900> to<00:03:46.110> need

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
tube angle I am actually going to need

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:49.490 
tube angle I am actually going to need
just<00:03:47.129> make<00:03:47.340> sure<00:03:47.519> the<00:03:47.670> top<00:03:47.940> edge<00:03:48.239> is<00:03:48.780> covering

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
just make sure the top edge is covering

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.100 
just make sure the top edge is covering
you<00:03:50.159> know<00:03:50.220> a<00:03:50.340> little<00:03:50.670> bit<00:03:50.790> above<00:03:51.209> the<00:03:51.750> bottom

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
you know a little bit above the bottom

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.630 
you know a little bit above the bottom
edge<00:03:52.200> of<00:03:52.349> this<00:03:52.470> so<00:03:52.680> you're<00:03:52.950> not<00:03:53.099> going<00:03:53.340> to<00:03:53.430> cone

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
edge of this so you're not going to cone

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.300 
edge of this so you're not going to cone
cut<00:03:53.909> the<00:03:54.319> occlusal<00:03:55.319> surface<00:03:55.709> of<00:03:55.890> the<00:03:56.010> teeth

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
cut the occlusal surface of the teeth

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.020 
cut the occlusal surface of the teeth
Patti<00:03:57.239> beam<00:03:57.480> that<00:03:58.200> has<00:03:58.560> this<00:03:58.830> if<00:03:59.670> this<00:03:59.849> has

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
Patti beam that has this if this has

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.539 
Patti beam that has this if this has
been<00:04:00.209> in<00:04:00.390> the<00:04:00.420> mouth<00:04:00.870> on<00:04:01.769> a<00:04:01.890> different<00:04:02.310> angle

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
been in the mouth on a different angle

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.729 
been in the mouth on a different angle
let's<00:04:02.970> just<00:04:03.150> say<00:04:03.360> it<00:04:03.450> was<00:04:03.540> like<00:04:03.750> this<00:04:04.019> okay

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
let's just say it was like this okay

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.270 
let's just say it was like this okay
close<00:04:05.010> now<00:04:05.970> you<00:04:06.030> can<00:04:06.299> see<00:04:06.540> that<00:04:06.750> this<00:04:07.129> angle<00:04:08.129> is

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
close now you can see that this angle is

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.929 
close now you can see that this angle is
even<00:04:08.610> more<00:04:08.939> severe<00:04:09.480> so<00:04:10.349> in<00:04:11.069> that<00:04:11.250> case<00:04:11.580> you're

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:11.939 
even more severe so in that case you're

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:13.410 
even more severe so in that case you're
going<00:04:12.150> to<00:04:12.239> have<00:04:12.360> to<00:04:12.510> increase

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
going to have to increase

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.090 
going to have to increase
bottom<00:04:14.420> up<00:04:14.600> your<00:04:14.840> vertical<00:04:15.470> tube<00:04:15.650> angle<00:04:15.980> to

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
bottom up your vertical tube angle to

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.490 
bottom up your vertical tube angle to
compensate<00:04:16.280> for<00:04:17.030> the<00:04:17.540> film<00:04:17.840> being<00:04:18.079> a<00:04:18.170> little

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
compensate for the film being a little

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.240 
compensate for the film being a little
bit<00:04:18.620> more<00:04:18.769> flatter<00:04:19.130> in<00:04:19.340> the<00:04:19.430> mouth<00:04:19.609> -<00:04:19.910> so

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
bit more flatter in the mouth - so

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.420 
bit more flatter in the mouth - so
you're<00:04:22.250> will<00:04:22.700> set<00:04:23.090> it<00:04:23.240> more<00:04:23.480> in<00:04:23.660> this<00:04:23.810> angle

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
you're will set it more in this angle

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.460 
you're will set it more in this angle
versus<00:04:25.430> the<00:04:25.580> first<00:04:25.760> one<00:04:26.000> that<00:04:26.120> I<00:04:26.180> showed<00:04:26.600> had

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
versus the first one that I showed had

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.190 
versus the first one that I showed had
you<00:04:27.650> change<00:04:28.010> this<00:04:28.340> or<00:04:28.730> not<00:04:29.510> changed<00:04:30.020> it

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
you change this or not changed it

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.530 
you change this or not changed it
accordingly<00:04:30.650> to<00:04:30.950> this<00:04:31.160> the<00:04:31.790> slant<00:04:32.120> of<00:04:32.360> this

will will cause the wrong vertical

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.630 
will will cause the wrong vertical
tubing<00:04:36.020> them<00:04:36.200> and<00:04:36.530> it<00:04:36.980> will<00:04:37.100> cause<00:04:37.370> an

elongated or / sharpened image so I

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.130 
elongated or / sharpened image so I
always<00:04:40.040> follow<00:04:40.460> the<00:04:40.790> position<00:04:41.510> of<00:04:41.660> this<00:04:41.810> with

always follow the position of this with
your<00:04:42.350> tube<00:04:42.590> and<00:04:42.800> you<00:04:42.920> shouldn't<00:04:43.220> have<00:04:43.340> any

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
your tube and you shouldn't have any

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.270 
your tube and you shouldn't have any
problem

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
problem

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.120 
problem
sometimes<00:04:46.280> the<00:04:46.870> premolar<00:04:47.870> PA<00:04:48.200> is<00:04:48.320> also<00:04:48.800> create

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
sometimes the premolar PA is also create

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.650 
sometimes the premolar PA is also create
a<00:04:49.160> problem<00:04:49.430> when<00:04:49.760> there's<00:04:49.940> tour<00:04:50.240> I<00:04:50.270> in<00:04:50.540> the

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
a problem when there's tour I in the

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.840 
a problem when there's tour I in the
mouth<00:04:50.840> I'm<00:04:51.380> going<00:04:51.890> to<00:04:51.950> show<00:04:52.190> you<00:04:52.250> the<00:04:52.610> two

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
mouth I'm going to show you the two

00:04:52.850 --> 00:05:00.520 
mouth I'm going to show you the two
techniques<00:04:53.600> with<00:04:54.160> with<00:04:55.160> using<00:04:55.700> them<00:04:59.530> first

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
techniques with with using them first

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.250 
techniques with with using them first
the<00:05:00.710> bisecting<00:05:01.250> angle<00:05:01.750> again<00:05:02.750> what<00:05:03.110> you<00:05:03.230> want

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
the bisecting angle again what you want

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.159 
the bisecting angle again what you want
to<00:05:03.560> do<00:05:03.770> is<00:05:04.070> put<00:05:04.370> the<00:05:04.520> film<00:05:04.760> itself<00:05:05.150> not<00:05:05.630> on<00:05:05.690> top

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
to do is put the film itself not on top

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:08.409 
to do is put the film itself not on top
of<00:05:06.200> Atari<00:05:06.770> so<00:05:07.100> that<00:05:07.250> the<00:05:07.370> film<00:05:07.580> is<00:05:07.700> next<00:05:08.090> to<00:05:08.270> the

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
of Atari so that the film is next to the

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:10.180 
of Atari so that the film is next to the
the<00:05:09.080> teeth<00:05:09.290> you're<00:05:09.560> going<00:05:09.680> to<00:05:09.740> move<00:05:09.950> it<00:05:10.070> away

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
the teeth you're going to move it away

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.360 
the teeth you're going to move it away
so<00:05:11.000> that<00:05:11.210> the<00:05:11.450> film<00:05:11.780> sits<00:05:12.350> directly<00:05:12.890> between

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
so that the film sits directly between

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.220 
so that the film sits directly between
the<00:05:13.700> two<00:05:14.000> Tori<00:05:14.270> there<00:05:14.540> should<00:05:14.750> be<00:05:14.840> a<00:05:14.870> space

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.230 
the two Tori there should be a space

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.430 
the two Tori there should be a space
between<00:05:15.260> the<00:05:15.860> two<00:05:16.040> that<00:05:16.580> allows<00:05:16.850> you<00:05:17.060> to

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
between the two that allows you to

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.520 
between the two that allows you to
actually<00:05:18.440> lower<00:05:19.010> the<00:05:19.450> x-ray<00:05:20.450> film<00:05:20.660> in<00:05:20.900> so<00:05:21.380> it's

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
actually lower the x-ray film in so it's

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:22.900 
actually lower the x-ray film in so it's
going<00:05:21.710> to<00:05:21.770> be<00:05:21.919> right<00:05:22.160> in<00:05:22.370> between<00:05:22.400> the<00:05:22.880> two

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
going to be right in between the two

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.450 
going to be right in between the two
have<00:05:23.570> the<00:05:23.720> patient<00:05:24.050> gently<00:05:24.410> closed<00:05:24.710> and<00:05:25.040> as

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
have the patient gently closed and as

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.890 
have the patient gently closed and as
they<00:05:25.669> close<00:05:25.970> the<00:05:26.270> film<00:05:26.479> is<00:05:26.600> going<00:05:26.750> to<00:05:26.810> adjust

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
they close the film is going to adjust

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.850 
they close the film is going to adjust
accordingly<00:05:27.290> to<00:05:27.830> how<00:05:27.950> it<00:05:28.160> can<00:05:28.310> fit<00:05:29.860> because

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
accordingly to how it can fit because

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.950 
accordingly to how it can fit because
the<00:05:31.250> film<00:05:31.460> now<00:05:31.669> is<00:05:31.880> slanting<00:05:32.360> a<00:05:32.450> little<00:05:32.870> bit

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
the film now is slanting a little bit

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.110 
the film now is slanting a little bit
away<00:05:33.200> from<00:05:33.229> you<00:05:33.680> you<00:05:34.220> want<00:05:34.430> to<00:05:34.550> make<00:05:34.700> sure<00:05:34.729> that

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
away from you you want to make sure that

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.150 
away from you you want to make sure that
your<00:05:35.300> vertical<00:05:35.720> tube<00:05:35.930> angle<00:05:36.110> is<00:05:36.500> slanting

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
your vertical tube angle is slanting

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.820 
your vertical tube angle is slanting
upward<00:05:37.910> to<00:05:38.150> accommodate<00:05:39.050> the<00:05:39.229> slant<00:05:39.560> of<00:05:39.800> the

more<00:05:42.290> than<00:05:42.620> this<00:05:42.860> way<00:05:43.130> so<00:05:43.190> because<00:05:43.940> it's

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
more than this way so because it's

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.270 
more than this way so because it's
slanted<00:05:44.690> you're<00:05:45.320> going<00:05:45.470> to<00:05:45.530> actually<00:05:45.770> set

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
slanted you're going to actually set

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.740 
slanted you're going to actually set
your<00:05:46.310> vertical<00:05:46.790> tube<00:05:47.000> angle<00:05:47.180> more<00:05:47.540> in<00:05:47.660> an

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
your vertical tube angle more in an

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.820 
your vertical tube angle more in an
upward<00:05:48.169> a<00:05:49.270> placement<00:05:50.270> when<00:05:51.200> your<00:05:51.350> X<00:05:51.500> rating

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 
upward a placement when your X rating

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.159 
upward a placement when your X rating
this<00:05:51.950> premolar<00:05:52.460> just<00:05:53.330> make<00:05:53.540> sure<00:05:53.780> the<00:05:53.960> top

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:54.169 
this premolar just make sure the top

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:56.800 
this premolar just make sure the top
edge<00:05:54.410> of<00:05:54.530> the<00:05:54.590> film<00:05:54.979> or<00:05:55.280> the<00:05:56.090> top<00:05:56.419> edge<00:05:56.630> of<00:05:56.750> the

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
edge of the film or the top edge of the

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.890 
edge of the film or the top edge of the
cone<00:05:57.229> is<00:05:58.150> covering<00:05:59.150> the<00:05:59.270> top<00:05:59.510> edge<00:05:59.750> of<00:05:59.840> the

00:05:59.890 --> 00:05:59.900 
cone is covering the top edge of the

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.990 
cone is covering the top edge of the
snapper<00:06:00.410> II<00:06:00.440> because<00:06:00.830> your<00:06:00.979> film<00:06:01.280> itself<00:06:01.729> is

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 
snapper II because your film itself is

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.990 
snapper II because your film itself is
right<00:06:02.900> below<00:06:03.560> the<00:06:04.070> snapper<00:06:04.460> ray<00:06:04.580> and<00:06:04.820> not

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 
right below the snapper ray and not

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.100 
right below the snapper ray and not
above<00:06:05.360> so<00:06:06.140> you<00:06:06.229> can<00:06:06.440> see<00:06:06.680> this<00:06:07.250> is<00:06:07.490> incorrect

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.110 
above so you can see this is incorrect

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.650 
above so you can see this is incorrect
this<00:06:09.110> is<00:06:09.320> correct

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:11.660 
this is correct

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.350 
this is correct
the<00:06:12.290> side<00:06:12.590> of<00:06:12.620> the<00:06:12.800> cone<00:06:13.130> should<00:06:13.580> actually<00:06:13.850> be

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360 
the side of the cone should actually be

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.070 
the side of the cone should actually be
so<00:06:14.750> that<00:06:14.960> it<00:06:15.110> just<00:06:15.820> skims<00:06:16.820> the<00:06:17.090> corner<00:06:17.600> of<00:06:17.810> the

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 
so that it just skims the corner of the

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.500 
so that it just skims the corner of the
snapper<00:06:18.470> II<00:06:18.650> and<00:06:19.010> that's<00:06:19.520> so<00:06:19.820> that<00:06:19.970> you<00:06:20.030> do<00:06:20.360> not

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:20.510 
snapper II and that's so that you do not

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:25.300 
snapper II and that's so that you do not
miss<00:06:20.900> the<00:06:21.200> the<00:06:21.500> actual<00:06:22.490> image<00:06:23.500> here<00:06:24.500> or<00:06:24.710> here

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:25.310 
miss the the actual image here or here

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:26.740 
miss the the actual image here or here
and<00:06:25.340> getting<00:06:25.790> cold<00:06:26.030> height<00:06:26.210> you<00:06:26.420> want<00:06:26.510> to<00:06:26.630> make

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:26.750 
and getting cold height you want to make

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.190 
and getting cold height you want to make
sure<00:06:26.930> that<00:06:27.140> the<00:06:27.410> whole<00:06:28.240> x-ray<00:06:29.240> a<00:06:29.570> plate<00:06:29.990> is

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:30.200 
sure that the whole x-ray a plate is

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.920 
sure that the whole x-ray a plate is
right<00:06:30.620> within<00:06:30.890> the<00:06:31.190> circle<00:06:31.670> so<00:06:32.360> this<00:06:32.570> would<00:06:32.780> be

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:32.930 
right within the circle so this would be

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:38.080 
right within the circle so this would be
correct<00:06:33.320> in<00:06:33.560> this<00:06:33.740> position<00:06:34.310> like<00:06:34.460> that<00:06:37.090> if

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.090 
correct in this position like that if

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:45.510 
correct in this position like that if
you're<00:06:38.450> using<00:06:38.480> the<00:06:39.050> Rings<00:06:39.320> for<00:06:39.950> the<00:06:42.220> premolars

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:45.520 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.760 

again<00:06:46.520> I'm<00:06:47.300> going<00:06:47.780> to<00:06:47.900> just<00:06:48.200> retract<00:06:48.590> the

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:48.770 
again I'm going to just retract the

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.380 
again I'm going to just retract the
cheek<00:06:49.010> a<00:06:49.100> little<00:06:49.130> bit<00:06:49.550> to<00:06:49.700> accommodate<00:06:49.910> this

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:50.390 
cheek a little bit to accommodate this

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:53.470 
cheek a little bit to accommodate this
piece<00:06:50.690> make<00:06:51.560> sure<00:06:51.830> that<00:06:52.070> this<00:06:52.370> edge<00:06:52.610> of<00:06:53.120> this

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:53.480 
piece make sure that this edge of this

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.770 
piece make sure that this edge of this
film<00:06:53.870> is<00:06:54.140> right<00:06:54.560> between<00:06:55.040> the<00:06:55.190> two<00:06:55.340> tor<00:06:55.610> I<00:06:55.780> you

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:56.780 
film is right between the two tor I you

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.120 
film is right between the two tor I you
can<00:06:56.900> feel<00:06:57.170> in<00:06:57.320> there<00:06:57.440> large<00:06:57.620> button<00:06:57.950> so<00:06:58.100> I

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:58.130 
can feel in there large button so I

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:00.610 
can feel in there large button so I
retract<00:06:58.850> the<00:06:58.970> cheek<00:06:59.270> to<00:06:59.510> accommodate<00:07:00.440> this

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:00.620 
retract the cheek to accommodate this

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.200 
retract the cheek to accommodate this
piece<00:07:00.890> it<00:07:01.100> makes<00:07:01.280> a<00:07:01.400> lot<00:07:01.580> easier<00:07:02.000> on<00:07:02.090> the

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:02.210 
piece it makes a lot easier on the

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:04.510 
piece it makes a lot easier on the
patient<00:07:02.510> and<00:07:02.930> then<00:07:03.560> so<00:07:03.800> you<00:07:03.830> can<00:07:03.950> just<00:07:04.280> kind<00:07:04.460> of

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:04.520 
patient and then so you can just kind of

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:05.710 
patient and then so you can just kind of
get<00:07:04.640> that<00:07:04.820> in<00:07:04.880> there<00:07:05.180> first

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:05.720 
get that in there first

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.590 
get that in there first
holding<00:07:06.050> the<00:07:06.140> cheek<00:07:06.350> out<00:07:06.530> and<00:07:07.300> then<00:07:08.300> it's

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:08.600 
holding the cheek out and then it's

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.390 
holding the cheek out and then it's
projection<00:07:09.350> down<00:07:09.530> just<00:07:09.920> a<00:07:10.040> little<00:07:10.070> bit<00:07:10.250> so

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.400 
projection down just a little bit so

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.040 
projection down just a little bit so
they<00:07:10.490> can<00:07:10.520> see<00:07:10.820> and<00:07:11.030> you<00:07:11.480> don't<00:07:11.510> want<00:07:11.810> this<00:07:11.990> on

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:12.050 
they can see and you don't want this on

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.680 
they can see and you don't want this on
the<00:07:12.530> Tauri<00:07:12.770> right<00:07:13.190> in<00:07:13.370> between<00:07:13.520> the<00:07:13.820> two<00:07:13.850> once

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:14.690 
the Tauri right in between the two once

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:16.480 
the Tauri right in between the two once
you<00:07:14.810> get<00:07:14.930> a<00:07:14.960> place<00:07:15.260> there<00:07:15.560> allow<00:07:16.220> them<00:07:16.370> to

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:16.490 
you get a place there allow them to

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.610 
you get a place there allow them to
close<00:07:16.790> let<00:07:17.210> go<00:07:17.360> of<00:07:17.480> the<00:07:17.570> bar<00:07:17.750> so<00:07:18.170> that<00:07:18.200> it<00:07:18.470> works

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:18.620 
close let go of the bar so that it works

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:23.100 
close let go of the bar so that it works
its<00:07:18.920> way<00:07:19.190> down<00:07:19.750> and<00:07:20.750> you<00:07:20.900> can<00:07:21.080> actually<00:07:21.970> close

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:23.110 
its way down and you can actually close

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:26.110 
its way down and you can actually close
fight<00:07:24.110> right<00:07:24.380> on<00:07:24.560> to<00:07:24.770> the<00:07:24.890> bite<00:07:25.070> block<00:07:25.250> slide
