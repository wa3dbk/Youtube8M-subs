00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
could have had a few more didn't take my

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.170 
could have had a few more didn't take my
chances<00:02:52.980> messing<00:02:53.459> around<00:02:53.549> a<00:02:53.730> bit<00:02:53.879> too<00:02:54.030> much

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
chances messing around a bit too much

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.640 
chances messing around a bit too much
like<00:02:54.390> I<00:02:54.540> normally<00:02:54.720> do<00:02:54.989> you<00:02:55.109> see<00:02:55.290> that<00:02:55.440> this<00:02:55.500> guy

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
like I normally do you see that this guy

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.440 
like I normally do you see that this guy
had<00:02:55.769> two<00:02:55.920> shots<00:02:56.190> on<00:02:56.280> Talia<00:02:56.549> compared<00:02:56.879> to<00:02:56.970> my<00:02:57.090> 10

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
had two shots on Talia compared to my 10

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.089 
had two shots on Talia compared to my 10
so<00:02:58.109> you<00:02:58.349> know<00:02:58.440> pretty<00:02:58.620> deserve<00:02:58.950> another

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
so you know pretty deserve another

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.190 
so you know pretty deserve another
victory<00:02:59.579> but<00:03:00.030> we<00:03:00.090> go<00:03:00.269> out<00:03:00.390> and<00:03:00.450> make<00:03:00.599> a<00:03:00.659> sign<00:03:01.019> in

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200

victory but we go out and make a sign in
here<00:03:01.290> I<00:03:01.470> think<00:03:01.680> Diaby<00:03:02.159> was<00:03:02.310> bit<00:03:02.579> low<00:03:02.700> on

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
here I think Diaby was bit low on

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:03.860 
here I think Diaby was bit low on
Fitness<00:03:03.209> didn't<00:03:03.480> really<00:03:03.629> want<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:03.810> get

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
Fitness didn't really want to get

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.240 
Fitness didn't really want to get
another<00:03:04.019> fitness<00:03:04.409> card<00:03:04.590> so<00:03:04.769> I<00:03:04.799> go<00:03:04.980> and<00:03:05.129> buy<00:03:05.220> a

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
another fitness card so I go and buy a

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.069 
another fitness card so I go and buy a
new<00:03:05.340> player<00:03:05.700> and<00:03:05.730> that's<00:03:05.970> pretty<00:03:06.239> he's<00:03:07.049> a

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
new player and that's pretty he's a

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.259 
new player and that's pretty he's a
French<00:03:07.500> player<00:03:07.769> in<00:03:08.010> league<00:03:08.459> one<00:03:08.700> and<00:03:08.970> he's<00:03:09.120> at

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
French player in league one and he's at

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.599 
French player in league one and he's at
the<00:03:09.359> same<00:03:09.510> team<00:03:09.780> as<00:03:10.079> hazard<00:03:10.859> that's<00:03:11.040> real<00:03:11.250> so

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
the same team as hazard that's real so

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.190 
the same team as hazard that's real so
hazard<00:03:12.090> gets<00:03:12.239> up<00:03:12.329> to<00:03:12.450> nine<00:03:12.599> came<00:03:12.840> with<00:03:12.989> him<00:03:13.109> in

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
hazard gets up to nine came with him in

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.020 
hazard gets up to nine came with him in
the<00:03:13.260> team<00:03:13.440> so<00:03:13.950> I<00:03:13.980> figure<00:03:14.310> I'll<00:03:14.400> give<00:03:14.549> him<00:03:14.700> a<00:03:14.760> go

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
the team so I figure I'll give him a go

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.940 
the team so I figure I'll give him a go
and<00:03:15.329> we<00:03:16.079> come<00:03:16.230> up<00:03:16.319> against<00:03:16.500> this<00:03:16.590> little

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.620

team<00:03:19.049> because<00:03:19.790> Mexican<00:03:20.790> teams<00:03:21.030> are<00:03:21.299> often

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
team because Mexican teams are often

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:22.940

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:02.129 
pretty decent player but most of the

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:03.110 
pretty decent player but most of the
time<00:04:02.250> he<00:04:02.340> was<00:04:02.400> just<00:04:02.549> trying<00:04:02.699> to<00:04:02.819> go<00:04:02.910> for<00:04:03.060> the

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
time he was just trying to go for the

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.729 
time he was just trying to go for the
over-the-top<00:04:03.750> fru<00:04:04.049> balls<00:04:04.260> he<00:04:04.349> was<00:04:04.500> really

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
over-the-top fru balls he was really

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.589 
over-the-top fru balls he was really
Pacey<00:04:05.010> forwards<00:04:05.849> and<00:04:05.970> it<00:04:06.150> wasn't<00:04:06.419> really

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
Pacey forwards and it wasn't really

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.509 
Pacey forwards and it wasn't really
working<00:04:06.840> if<00:04:07.260> you<00:04:07.620> know<00:04:07.769> someone's<00:04:08.069> tactic<00:04:08.430> and

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
working if you know someone's tactic and

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:09.770 
working if you know someone's tactic and
you<00:04:08.609> can<00:04:08.730> easily<00:04:08.970> block<00:04:09.150> it<00:04:09.299> off<00:04:09.419> then<00:04:09.629> they

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
you can easily block it off then they

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.629 
you can easily block it off then they
don't<00:04:09.900> stand<00:04:10.230> a<00:04:10.379> chance<00:04:10.410> against<00:04:10.949> you<00:04:11.069> so<00:04:11.519> we

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:11.639 
don't stand a chance against you so we

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:12.710 
don't stand a chance against you so we
just<00:04:11.790> go<00:04:11.849> ahead<00:04:11.940> and<00:04:12.060> go<00:04:12.269> straight<00:04:12.569> into

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
just go ahead and go straight into

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.580 
just go ahead and go straight into

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
another game I think we might have

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:14.629 
another game I think we might have

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:14.639 
swapped a few players around maybe
