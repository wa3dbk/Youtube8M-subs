00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:01.959
 numerous simulations 

00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:04.100
 part modeling process 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.420
 including the creation of several solid 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.270
 tel the result of serial 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.750
 modeling can be like one 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:11.360
 village 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.759
 and several bodies 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:15.519
 that is, we nudity a different detail every village in 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:17.570
 process in nagatino you are modeling 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.189
 is created in the usual way that is by 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.509
 perform boolean operations nato 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:24.820
 bulk elements are first created 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.570
 the bases are then added to the body 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.739
 or subtracted from it 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:31.809
 generators are created 

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:33.550
 additional constructive 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.059
 items as most typical 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.170
 use examples 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.850
 multiseries modeling 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.620
 are designing with 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.760
 multiple parties and the creation of bodies 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.739
 subtraction design with 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:46.440
 multiple sides way 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.719
 design at which individual 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.510
 parts of a part are created as 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.810
 separate bodies and then combine 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.790
 at the same time intersecting bodies 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.100
 can be combined by doing it 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.670
 does not have more operations and not 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:01.929
 intersecting 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:03.840
 by building a new 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.750
 overlapping with them sat body creation 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.550
 subtraction design method when 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.720
 which villages details are formed by 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.540
 subtracting some bodies from others in this 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.310
 case you need creator 2 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.280
 intersecting bodies the first of which 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.930
 will determine the shape of the part and the second 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.410
 cavity shape 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.280
 then it should be done on the bodies 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.240
 more howl subtraction operations second 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.120
 body from the first given way 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.900
 design is recommended for 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.420
 creating details with estate pockets 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.970
 or other samples 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.260
 passing through difficult surfaces 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.359
 name is another rounding ball 

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:41.409
 total number of shares in the details 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.709
 displayed in the detail tree in brackets 

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:46.599
 after its name when working with initial 

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:47.700
 details can be recommended 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.420
 display tree 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.080
 in the form of structure this method is more clearly 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.210
 seems to rates nudity other 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.530
 details and the order of its creation than 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.580
 sequence display 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.259
 building element forming bodies 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.700
 grouped into sections 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.979
 body names 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.700
 sections coincide with the names of the grounds 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.170
 tel 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.090
 if there is pain in the detail 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.680
 body operations 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.130
 then it is placed in the section which 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.560
 matches the first of 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.200
 participating bodies 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.180
 the second body involved in this 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.349
 pain you select is displayed as 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:22.609
 subordinates to her 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:24.319
 if the item is present 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.840
 uniting several bodies 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.200
 then it is placed in the section which 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.599
 matches the first of 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:31.760
 united bodies 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.200
 the rest are intact by this 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.930
 items are displayed as 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.139
 subordinate to him 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:38.499
 combining elements 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:40.539
 are designated in the tree by special 

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:41.409
 pictograms
