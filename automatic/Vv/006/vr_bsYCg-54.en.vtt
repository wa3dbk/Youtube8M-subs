00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.000
 Foreword summary, in the previous episode of "Liu Ding is in chaos"... 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.090
 No, Liu Ding, you don't understand 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.090
 I don't want to continue to be the only sensible person here. 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.080
 If you don’t listen to me again 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.060
 Maybe now is when I should leave the kitchen... 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.090
 Leave forever! 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.080
 Hey! Hey! Pear! 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.080
 How? Liu Ding 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.010
 Do you think we can talk about it later? 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.030
 If my calculations are correct, 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.080
 This solution will make me a perfect apple. 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.010
 Now I just have to... 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.040
 Yeah! I love Kool-Aid!! (a juice drink) 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.040
 Marshmallow!! No!! 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.030
 Oh, it’s not a cherry taste. 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.030
 Oh, no!! 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.010
 No, I don't believe it, impossible. 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.020
 Are you the mastermind of all this confusion? 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.060
 Yes 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.010
 Please, I thought this was obvious enough. 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.070
 Are we getting it? 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.010
 Not so big 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.040
 Yeah, I am riding a water motorcycle like Robin Hood. 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.010
 Liu Ding, give me my beautiful green hat!! 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.060
 Liu Ding!!! 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.060
 Look, I told you about it. 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.000
 You always don't listen to me!! 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.010
 Oh, come less, pear 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.070
 Don't you want to leave the kitchen? 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.040
 If you think this is just a big ball of hair 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.070
 Then wait and see this super huge marshmallow! (This is in the channel of imitating a What the Buck Show, host Buckley will introduce some current events, then say What the Buck) 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.040
 (This is in the channel of imitating a What the Buck Show, host Buckley will introduce some current events, then say What the Buck) 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.060
 Yeah~Cloud eats like cotton candy!! (cotton candy, the kind of string of fluffy sugar with a bamboo stick, not his own) 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.070
 Oh, this fake beard makes me unable to stand it. 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.000
 Quiet, pear 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.090
 We all have to change together to keep a low profile. 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.000
 Very short appearance? (low profile low-key, can also be translated to this) 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.050
 Then I want the gnome apple he should want... 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.090
 Oh, enough, shut up! 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.030
 Rotten~~ 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.060
 Bad and fake 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.060
 They have used this pistachio already. 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.080
 Oh, I caught you, Liu Ding! 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.080
 Now let’s see if your grinning mouth can let you escape this trick. 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.050
 Warning, fuel has been exhausted 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.090
 All systems are automatically turned off 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.020
 Oh my god. 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.060
 This.. this is not very good 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.020
 Oh no, he is coming to us! 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.070
 Yes, he is really an angry grapefruit ("The Angry Grapes" is a famous American novel in the 1930s, and Liu Ding changed the grapes into grapefruit) 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.020
 Liu Ding, I know that time is tight now. 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.040
 But there is something I always wanted to let you know. 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.090
 Really? What is it? Passion fruit 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.030
 Remember to be careful when taking off 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.050
 Jetpack is really fast 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.080
 Yeah, come on, pear 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.050
 Let's play! 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.080
 Ok, wait for me, everyone. 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.090
 Everyone? 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.010
 (The ex-sex summary ends) The next step is the wonderful finale! 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.050
 So bored... 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.050
 Hey! Hey! Orange! 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.010
 Hello, the audience. What's the matter? (hello audience is a line that TOBY often speaks in his films.) 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.080
 It’s okay, it’s boring for a long day, right? 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.050
 Yes, it’s really long. 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.070
 Yes, long ~ long ~ long ~ 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:00.050
 Yes, it’s as long as a bucket of balls on the balcony. 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.080
 It’s the longest day ever. 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.010
 Yes, God bless your face (bless your face is also the common phrase of the voicewriter TOBY) 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.070
 Oh, hey, right. 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.040
 what? 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.010
 knife! 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.060
 Oh, poor oranges. 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.000
 Why must he be cut in half? (Liu Ding speaks half to go, half=half, and must leave have to go homophonic) 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.020
 bored 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.350
 Bored, bored, bored, bored, bored 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.040
 (The next episode) The next episode of "Liu Ding is in chaos" 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.160
 Ok, pear, then this is the most important part (the next episode). The next episode of "Liu Ding is in chaos" 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.020
 Ok, pear, then this is the most important part. 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.050
 Be sure to cut the red wire 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.000
 Understand, no problem, passion fruit 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 Have you heard that, Liu Ding? 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.030
 Cut the red line and we're done. 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.090
 I am about to cut it. 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.000
 Pear, stop! Don't let Liu Ding do this!! 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.090
 Calm down, passion fruit, nothing will happen... 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.070
 No!! You can't figure out the situation. 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.050
 Liu Ding, he can't do this because he... 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.010
 He is color blind 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.010
 what!? 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.090
 Ah, it’s bad. 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.940
 (polujony subtitle production) 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.040
 Hey! Hey! Audience! Audience! Hey! 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.030
 What? 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.080
 Do you know that I am actually an artist? 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.000
 Because I really attract people! (draw a crowd, draw attracts and has the meaning of painting, pun)
