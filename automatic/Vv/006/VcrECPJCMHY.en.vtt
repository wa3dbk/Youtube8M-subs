00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.160
 Well, tomorrow will start the first 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.370
 slightly tense moment of the expedition 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.830
 we have been here many days 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:21.230
 for two we have also done everything 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.270
 possible to train a little but 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.450
 tomorrow we leave with the intention of 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.940
 at least sleep two nights in the field 1 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.970
 and get to field 2 that if we see that the 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:34.280
 time allows us maybe we are a 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.160
 more night or something like that we'll see no 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.800
 we have nothing sure but the intention is 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.380
 of going to sleep at least during 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.930
 two nights and try to make a 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.460
 climb up to field 2 let's hope that 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.910
 yes now the good weather starts and 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:52.460
 well let's see if there is luck 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.920
 I do not know 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:01:00.070
 10 pieces for breakfast variety 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:03.070
 much more to get in protein 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.070
 calditos 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.680
 our way 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:21.060
 always ham 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:23.550
 one thing and the olives that you 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.740
 olives among the wonderfully and 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.860
 Also, salad Tangier and Nador and each 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.860
 time 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:33.480
 lentils and always carry the 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.280
 field a mucus nominated and then we're going to 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.130
 we will mix them with the rice that we 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.829
 they do to you before them 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:45.829
 the cookies plus drinks replenishers 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:45.829
 barrels 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.869
 We were like to have food for 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.799
 three days but it can be for five if 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.799
 we have plenty 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.520
 Well, here I am going to show you a 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.350
 little what I have to title 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.670
 individual as a doctor that I have to 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.619
 bring things a little more powerful 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.640
 that the ones that any mountaineer takes to 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.460
 the companions we have already given them 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.650
 oral medication so individual for each 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.920
 and one'll show a little of what 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.319
 I carry 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.830
 a lot of medication to put injectables 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.830
 as you can see 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.819
 a thermal blanket always suspecting a 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.000
 possible life then to be protected 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:33.489
 of it immobilization material together 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.010
 with the bandages for what he did to us 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:38.400
 lack 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.680
 a lot of input material and 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.689
 supplements both protein and 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.260
 minerals like glucose a little bit of 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:46.019
 all 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.030
 the famous triple medication therapy 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:51.140
 of composite height with that of that goal 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.090
 frozen area the mox TV 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.060
 all the fungibles that we need 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.670
 to take a peripheral road to put 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.550
 in injectable medication something for 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.959
 eye protection if we need 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.300
 and of course the famous aspirin that 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.950
 we are always with us this year 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.870
 apart from everything that is medication of 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.920
 height we have been very involved in 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.590
 topics of research studies 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.970
 we have very important support with the 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.580
 university medicine school 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.620
 malaga of sports medicine and here 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.739
 we are measuring so much in gorina 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.570
 as in saliva of different patterns that 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.250
 let's hope they serve a lot and that 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.000
 let us know more about the 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.000
 altitude physiology 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:35.040
 so you're going to have little news 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.080
 ours during these three days but 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.890
 Then we can tell you many 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.319
 things above and many images 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.280
 Well, to continue with us a strong 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.280
 hug friends
