00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
only one difference and it's gonna be

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.389 
only one difference and it's gonna be
hard<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.719> see<00:00:36.899> but<00:00:37.140> I'm<00:00:37.920> gonna<00:00:38.100> show<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:38.309> the

old ways to telling the old way of

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.720 
old ways to telling the old way of
telling<00:00:40.140> course<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:41.040> was<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.280> look<00:00:41.399> at<00:00:41.579> the

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
telling course it was to look at the

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.209 
telling course it was to look at the
little<00:00:41.969> otter<00:00:42.149> animal<00:00:42.890> these<00:00:43.890> two<00:00:44.070> are<00:00:44.129> the

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
little otter animal these two are the

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.880 
little otter animal these two are the
same<00:00:44.460> but<00:00:44.640> fake<00:00:44.850> ones<00:00:45.320> were<00:00:46.320> did<00:00:46.500> that<00:00:46.649> case

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
same but fake ones were did that case

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.880 
same but fake ones were did that case
though<00:00:48.980> fake<00:00:49.980> ones<00:00:50.539> are<00:00:51.539> much<00:00:51.899> darker<00:00:52.230> however

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
though fake ones are much darker however

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.279 
though fake ones are much darker however
all<00:00:53.250> new<00:00:53.760> faking<00:00:54.300> once<00:00:54.420> these<00:00:54.600> days<00:00:54.870> match

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
all new faking once these days match

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.380 
all new faking once these days match
them<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:55.770> in<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.309> event<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.670> it's<00:00:57.000> darker

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
them so in the event that it's darker

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.670 
them so in the event that it's darker
you<00:00:57.480> might<00:00:57.600> have<00:00:57.690> got<00:00:57.780> an<00:00:57.840> older<00:00:58.170> counterfeit

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
you might have got an older counterfeit

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.220 
you might have got an older counterfeit
so<00:00:58.829> that's<00:00:58.980> easy<00:00:59.219> way<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.370> tell<00:00:59.960> in<00:01:00.960> case<00:01:01.140> you

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
so that's easy way to tell in case you

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.520 
so that's easy way to tell in case you
don't<00:01:02.090> so

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
don't so

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.820 
don't so
nobody<00:01:04.530> tells<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:04.890> course<00:01:05.129> this<00:01:05.760> gray<00:01:06.060> bar

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
different product and that's one way to

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.940 
different product and that's one way to
tell<00:01:59.930> other<00:02:00.930> than<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.320> packaging<00:02:01.799> is

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
confused for a second anyway so there's

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:44.940 
confused for a second anyway so there's
only<00:02:42.909> one<00:02:43.030> difference<00:02:43.390> and<00:02:44.200> it's<00:02:44.440> hard<00:02:44.650> to<00:02:44.739> see

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
only one difference and it's hard to see

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.339 
only one difference and it's hard to see
but<00:02:45.909> there<00:02:46.180> is<00:02:46.329> a<00:02:46.359> difference<00:02:46.750> it's<00:02:47.019> probably

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
but there is a difference it's probably

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:48.629 
but there is a difference it's probably
impossible<00:02:47.530> once<00:02:47.889> you<00:02:47.980> have<00:02:48.069> side-by-side

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:48.639 
impossible once you have side-by-side

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:51.420 
impossible once you have side-by-side
comparison<00:02:49.090> like<00:02:49.269> this<00:02:49.420> video<00:02:49.599> but<00:02:50.590> this<00:02:51.310> is

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
comparison like this video but this is

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.759 
comparison like this video but this is
the<00:02:51.519> real<00:02:51.700> one<00:02:51.909> I'm<00:02:52.180> first<00:02:52.510> I'm<00:02:52.629> first<00:02:52.769> now

there this these are real so don't try
to<00:03:08.109> look<00:03:08.290> for<00:03:08.470> damage<00:03:08.620> now<00:03:09.400> this<00:03:09.549> is<00:03:09.639> the<00:03:09.730> fake

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
to look for damage now this is the fake

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.979 
to look for damage now this is the fake
one<00:03:11.370> see<00:03:12.370> it's<00:03:12.549> not<00:03:12.670> as<00:03:12.849> sharp<00:03:13.090> but<00:03:13.690> it's<00:03:13.810> still

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
one see it's not as sharp but it's still

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:14.369 
one see it's not as sharp but it's still
there

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:14.379 
there

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:18.589 
there
so<00:03:14.919> we<00:03:15.699> just<00:03:15.849> show<00:03:16.840> these<00:03:16.989> two<00:03:17.290> side-by-side

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
so we just show these two side-by-side

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.879 
so we just show these two side-by-side
so<00:03:19.599> that's<00:03:19.930> not<00:03:20.079> lighting<00:03:20.470> you<00:03:20.560> see<00:03:20.739> there

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:20.889 
so that's not lighting you see there

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:24.300 
so that's not lighting you see there
guys<00:03:21.099> that's<00:03:21.879> just<00:03:22.329> the<00:03:22.449> font<00:03:22.720> as<00:03:23.190> you<00:03:24.190> can

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
guys that's just the font as you can

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.589 
guys that's just the font as you can
tell<00:03:24.489> the<00:03:24.609> fake<00:03:24.819> one<00:03:25.000> which<00:03:25.150> is<00:03:25.239> on<00:03:25.329> the<00:03:25.449> right

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 
tell the fake one which is on the right

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:32.670 
tell the fake one which is on the right
side<00:03:25.810> is<00:03:26.169> not<00:03:27.129> as<00:03:27.370> sharp<00:03:28.769> so<00:03:31.500> so<00:03:32.500> I'm<00:03:32.560> just

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
side is not as sharp so so I'm just

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.050 
side is not as sharp so so I'm just
moving<00:03:32.829> these<00:03:33.129> with<00:03:33.370> the<00:03:33.489> light<00:03:33.699> so<00:03:33.910> you<00:03:33.970> can

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
moving these with the light so you can

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.240 
moving these with the light so you can
tell<00:03:34.329> but<00:03:34.569> just<00:03:35.410> look<00:03:35.680> at<00:03:35.799> the<00:03:35.919> difference

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
tell but just look at the difference

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.099 
tell but just look at the difference
look<00:03:36.430> at<00:03:36.699> where<00:03:36.879> it<00:03:37.000> says<00:03:37.150> China<00:03:37.510> on<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:37.930> real

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
look at where it says China on the real

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:40.439 
look at where it says China on the real
one<00:03:38.290> on<00:03:38.379> the<00:03:38.470> left<00:03:38.709> side<00:03:38.949> and<00:03:39.280> then<00:03:40.150> look<00:03:40.329> at

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:40.449 
one on the left side and then look at

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:43.890 
one on the left side and then look at
China<00:03:40.750> here<00:03:42.090> perhaps<00:03:43.090> that's<00:03:43.389> easier<00:03:43.660> see

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
China here perhaps that's easier see

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.890 
China here perhaps that's easier see
it's<00:03:44.199> China<00:03:44.470> see<00:03:44.680> look<00:03:44.829> at<00:03:44.949> that<00:03:45.690> hey<00:03:46.690> then

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
it's China see look at that hey then
