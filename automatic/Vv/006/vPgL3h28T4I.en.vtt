00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.190
 what have you stayed warmly 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.700
 welcome here via tv to one 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:21.099
 another part of the ports two minutes today 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.740
 did you want to know what mine mean 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:26.140
 most embarrassing real life moments were 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.550
 and yes, I 'm definitely good at that 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.710
 we are not just about everything 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.380
 speak although he naturally as the 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.640
 But the main topic is always one 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.530
 wants eick I want a course 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.570
 tell a little something and I have to say 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.120
 where I've got my head shattered over 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.820
 my over with embarrassing moments in the 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.230
 So there was always something there 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.750
 which was a bit embarrassing 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.730
 but really super super mega super 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.609
 Part I was actually so in 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.829
 lately i have nothing 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:55.780
 Although two things have limited the 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.480
 I have come to think of it so they are 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.199
 yes one more of my daredevils 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.550
 from my angered time and the other 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.350
 when the new theater-ag was 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.780
 I start the two minutes and then 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.640
 So I'm going to start the first stories 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.579
 People I was really in the theater-ag 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.290
 So I learned so many pieces by heart 

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:16.570
 We always agreed 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.130
 role sticks the right group so it 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.430
 was not an ag in the school that 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:24.610
 he really is such a club a theater case 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.229
 and i have peter pan in a roll 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.060
 So I played the real ones 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.119
 get in the lead and i have peter 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.649
 played pan and that was the same 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.820
 my first role at all 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:35.380
 played 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.390
 So I played a bit 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.950
 talked about you doing that 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.259
 you well that was really a 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.430
 stage in front of the audience and the cards at 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.860
 quite what tasted 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.299
 and of course very little but it 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.560
 has really really fun 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.100
 Made with the people together 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.799
 play 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.090
 and yes, and then it was peter panter 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:56.140
 rich in the main role 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.729
 and then came my part and me 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.189
 had to and that was such a play 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.890
 I also had to sing at the beginning 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:06.369
 to see and I start to sing and 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.850
 I start the first stanza and then 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:12.790
 the refrain and then the second stanza 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:15.820
 and I did not remember what they were singing 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.310
 should be cit or do you stand on this 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:21.480
 stage and taught 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.010
 not on and the music keeps going and 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.620
 then I waited until I waited 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.060
 this stanza was over and then came 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.090
 the next one and I just got back then 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.980
 the format of healthy my god and as 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.489
 It was over and I was back 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.099
 and not true 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.690
 I was backstage again 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.430
 I was really shocked I was 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.989
 really good and I was right 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:45.420
 speechless and unfortunately something to me too 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.459
 helpless in the speed I measured was real 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.890
 I would think since I was twelve years old 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.200
 or so but that was already right 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.910
 moment where my heart something like that 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.959
 first in my life or at least that way 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.239
 where I can remember 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.380
 that stopped me and yes 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.290
 the two minutes are actually now 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.700
 but again I do not care 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.549
 now anyway and the second story 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.530
 Get rid of my angered time and time 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.390
 Although people think most of them 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.599
 you are now in the age should be 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.950
 check the women and so on and yes 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.720
 we were on the beach we were on the beach 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.790
 in poland that was really awesome 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.340
 Men's vacation we did that was 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.170

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:27.600

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.590
 played few girls volleyball and how 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.450
 is always like that is swimming 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.709
 somehow because then you speak the 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.299
 and then you never look at it 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.799
 together until the first time you 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.890

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:42.450

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.810

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.120

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:59.069
 stormy winds windy windy 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.329
 summertime where there were also many waves 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:05.190
 and I dive before a run but 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:07.620
 somehow not quite so and then 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.569
 comes exactly a wave and as I do so 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.690
 when you start diving 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:14.390
 then the silver height start came in my 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.549
 band and i really know 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.940
