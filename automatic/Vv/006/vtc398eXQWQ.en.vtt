00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
Rusty's suspension components video one

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.160 
Rusty's suspension components video one
still<00:00:08.040> got<00:00:08.160> some<00:00:08.370> work<00:00:08.400> to<00:00:08.700> do<00:00:08.880> so<00:00:09.210> here's<00:00:10.019> the

still got some work to do so here's the

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.080 
still got some work to do so here's the
first<00:00:10.380> one<00:00:10.590> to<00:00:10.740> show<00:00:10.800> you<00:00:11.010> got<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.790> steering

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
first one to show you got the steering

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.959 
first one to show you got the steering
stuff<00:00:12.509> all<00:00:12.690> taken<00:00:13.080> care<00:00:13.110> of

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:13.969 
stuff all taken care of

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:17.930 
stuff all taken care of
I've<00:00:14.969> got<00:00:15.210> this<00:00:15.389> new<00:00:16.010> solid<00:00:17.010> tie<00:00:17.250> rod<00:00:17.520> with<00:00:17.760> new

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
I've got this new solid tie rod with new

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.269 
I've got this new solid tie rod with new
ball<00:00:18.570> joints<00:00:19.170> that<00:00:19.380> was<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.560> big<00:00:19.770> problem<00:00:20.160> on

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
ball joints that was a big problem on

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.040 
ball joints that was a big problem on
the<00:00:20.400> old<00:00:20.550> steering<00:00:20.850> so<00:00:21.359> now<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.539> tie<00:00:21.810> rod

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
the old steering so now the tie rod

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.259 
the old steering so now the tie rod
comes<00:00:22.320> all<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.650> way<00:00:22.680> across<00:00:23.660> just<00:00:24.660> solid<00:00:24.960> and

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:26.269 
comes all the way across just solid and

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.330 
comes all the way across just solid and
then<00:00:27.269> another<00:00:27.990> new<00:00:28.260> ball<00:00:28.500> joint<00:00:28.830> over<00:00:29.070> on<00:00:29.189> this

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
then another new ball joint over on this

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.510 
then another new ball joint over on this
side<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:30.920> you<00:00:31.920> can<00:00:32.040> see<00:00:32.219> we've<00:00:32.369> got<00:00:32.460> a

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
side and you can see we've got a

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.020 
side and you can see we've got a
steering<00:00:32.880> stabilizer<00:00:33.239> here<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:35.030> just

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
steering stabilizer here and just

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.490 
steering stabilizer here and just
driving<00:00:36.300> over<00:00:36.540> here<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:36.899> was<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.079> first<00:00:37.320> time

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
driving over here it was the first time

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.410 
driving over here it was the first time
I<00:00:37.530> drove<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:38.040> since<00:00:38.250> we<00:00:38.340> post<00:00:38.730> stuff<00:00:38.940> on<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.360> I

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
I drove it since we post stuff on and I

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.090 
I drove it since we post stuff on and I
can<00:00:39.600> tell<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:39.899> these<00:00:40.020> steering<00:00:40.410> stabilizers

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
can tell you these steering stabilizers

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.729 
can tell you these steering stabilizers
make<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.340> huge<00:00:41.670> difference<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.510> just<00:00:42.870> I<00:00:43.170> don't

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
make a huge difference it just I don't

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.950 
make a huge difference it just I don't
know<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:44.040> handles<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.489> lot<00:00:44.610> better<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.329> you've

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
know it handles a lot better so you've

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.950 
know it handles a lot better so you've
got<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.670> steering<00:00:47.670> stabilizer<00:00:47.879> just<00:00:48.629> mounts

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
got the steering stabilizer just mounts

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.110 
got the steering stabilizer just mounts
onto<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:50.010> front<00:00:50.309> differential<00:00:50.910> there

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
onto the the front differential there

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.139 
onto the the front differential there
and<00:00:51.739> you<00:00:52.739> know<00:00:52.829> I'm<00:00:52.980> not<00:00:53.100> particularly<00:00:53.579> fond

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
and you know I'm not particularly fond

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.500 
and you know I'm not particularly fond
of<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.480> fact<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:54.960> it's<00:00:55.140> below<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.680> tie<00:00:55.890> rod

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
of the fact that it's below the tie rod

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.630 
of the fact that it's below the tie rod
they<00:00:57.510> say<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:57.780> can<00:00:57.989> get<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.170> mount<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.710> flip<00:00:59.430> the

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
they say you can get a mount to flip the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.090 
they say you can get a mount to flip the
steering<00:01:00.090> stabilizer<00:01:00.750> up<00:01:01.379> over<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.859> top<00:01:02.070> of

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
steering stabilizer up over the top of

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.740 
steering stabilizer up over the top of
the<00:01:02.280> tie<00:01:02.460> rod<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:02.850> you're<00:01:03.000> not<00:01:03.059> bashing<00:01:03.390> on

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
the tie rod so you're not bashing on

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.210 
the tie rod so you're not bashing on
rocks<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.260> stuff<00:01:04.470> I'll<00:01:04.680> probably<00:01:04.860> look<00:01:05.040> into

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
rocks and stuff I'll probably look into

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.240 
rocks and stuff I'll probably look into
that<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.390> went<00:01:06.689> on<00:01:06.750> well<00:01:07.049> still<00:01:08.010> have<00:01:08.100> to

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
that so that went on well still have to

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.609 
that so that went on well still have to
adjust<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.850> though<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.030> can<00:01:09.390> tell<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.659> I'm

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
adjust it though I can tell that I'm

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.560 
adjust it though I can tell that I'm
definitely<00:01:11.010> out<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.460> alignment<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.150> vehicles

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
definitely out of alignment the vehicles

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.109 
definitely out of alignment the vehicles
tracking<00:01:13.110> straight<00:01:13.470> but<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.580> feel<00:01:14.850> like<00:01:14.939> the

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
tracking straight but I feel like the

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.240 
tracking straight but I feel like the
tires<00:01:15.360> are<00:01:15.750> kind<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.350> working<00:01:16.799> against<00:01:17.159> each

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
tires are kind of working against each

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.820 
tires are kind of working against each
other<00:01:17.460> so<00:01:18.330> another<00:01:18.900> new<00:01:19.110> joint<00:01:19.409> there<00:01:19.619> that

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
other so another new joint there that

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.760 
other so another new joint there that
was<00:01:19.950> another<00:01:20.159> problem<00:01:20.490> we're<00:01:21.119> all<00:01:21.210> greased<00:01:21.509> up

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
was another problem we're all greased up

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.600 
was another problem we're all greased up
drag<00:01:22.770> bars<00:01:23.900> adjustable<00:01:24.900> going<00:01:25.110> up<00:01:25.290> here<00:01:25.610> with

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
drag bars adjustable going up here with

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.710 
drag bars adjustable going up here with
another<00:01:27.290> steering<00:01:28.290> stabilizer<00:01:29.570> so<00:01:30.570> that's

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
another steering stabilizer so that's

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.380 
another steering stabilizer so that's
helping<00:01:31.110> out<00:01:31.729> and<00:01:34.280> then<00:01:35.280> we've<00:01:35.520> got<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:36.030> haven't

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
helping out and then we've got I haven't

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.149 
helping out and then we've got I haven't
put<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.659> new<00:01:36.780> drop<00:01:37.020> pitman<00:01:37.259> arm<00:01:37.560> yet<00:01:37.860> but

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
put the new drop pitman arm yet but

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.499 
put the new drop pitman arm yet but
there's<00:01:38.369> one<00:01:38.520> on<00:01:38.729> there<00:01:38.939> I'm<00:01:39.060> not<00:01:39.180> sure<00:01:39.240> if

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
there's one on there I'm not sure if

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.999 
there's one on there I'm not sure if
it's<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.750> right<00:01:39.960> size<00:01:40.170> for<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.650> lift<00:01:40.829> I'm

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
it's the right size for the lift I'm

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.800 
it's the right size for the lift I'm
going<00:01:41.310> with<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:41.700> I'll<00:01:41.820> have<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.119> swap<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.420> out

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
going with so I'll have to swap that out

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.270 
going with so I'll have to swap that out
but<00:01:43.020> another<00:01:43.259> new<00:01:43.470> joint<00:01:43.740> up<00:01:43.890> here<00:01:44.130> all

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
but another new joint up here all

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.969 
but another new joint up here all
greased<00:01:44.670> up<00:01:44.939> there's<00:01:45.899> your<00:01:46.140> heavy-duty<00:01:46.590> frame

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
greased up there's your heavy-duty frame

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.240 
greased up there's your heavy-duty frame
mount<00:01:47.340> for<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:47.970> adjustable<00:01:48.600> track<00:01:48.869> bar

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
mount for the adjustable track bar

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.080 
mount for the adjustable track bar
that's<00:01:50.250> on<00:01:50.520> there<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:52.460> got<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.490> adjusted<00:01:54.000> as

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
that's on there and got it adjusted as

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.810 
that's on there and got it adjusted as
close<00:01:54.329> as<00:01:54.509> we<00:01:54.659> can<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:54.899> Center<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.470> axle<00:01:55.890> so

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
close as we can to Center the axle so

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.569 
close as we can to Center the axle so
that's<00:01:57.000> all<00:01:57.180> looking<00:01:57.570> good<00:01:58.219> and<00:01:59.219> again<00:01:59.549> I

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
that's all looking good and again I

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.429 
that's all looking good and again I
haven't<00:01:59.790> done<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.149> coil<00:02:00.390> spacers<00:02:00.930> yet<00:02:01.170> so

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
haven't done the coil spacers yet so

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.170 
haven't done the coil spacers yet so
when<00:02:01.590> we<00:02:01.710> lift<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:02.040> up<00:02:02.189> another<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:03.000> know<00:02:03.119> two

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
when we lift it up another you know two

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.510 
when we lift it up another you know two
to<00:02:03.390> three<00:02:03.689> inches<00:02:04.070> we're<00:02:05.070> going<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.250> have<00:02:05.369> to

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
to three inches we're going to have to

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.310 
to three inches we're going to have to
come<00:02:05.700> back<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.119> adjust<00:02:06.180> all<00:02:06.540> this<00:02:06.719> stuff<00:02:07.049> but

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
come back and adjust all this stuff but

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.639 
come back and adjust all this stuff but
looks<00:02:07.950> really<00:02:08.310> nice

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
looks really nice

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.890 
looks really nice
beefier<00:02:10.280> definitely<00:02:10.970> handles<00:02:11.390> better<00:02:11.569> no

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
beefier definitely handles better no

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.530 
beefier definitely handles better no
more<00:02:12.079> knocking<00:02:12.709> and<00:02:13.010> and<00:02:13.370> you<00:02:13.700> know<00:02:13.819> just

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
more knocking and and you know just

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.240 
more knocking and and you know just
weird<00:02:14.750> stuff<00:02:15.140> going<00:02:15.170> on<00:02:15.530> with<00:02:15.709> the<00:02:15.799> steering

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
weird stuff going on with the steering

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.839 
weird stuff going on with the steering
so<00:02:17.239> that's<00:02:17.390> good<00:02:17.659> and<00:02:17.930> then<00:02:18.370> come<00:02:19.370> around<00:02:19.400> here

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
so that's good and then come around here

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:23.259 
so that's good and then come around here
to<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.150> back<00:02:20.860> and<00:02:21.860> we'll<00:02:22.010> check<00:02:22.250> out<00:02:22.489> the<00:02:22.700> rear

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
to the back and we'll check out the rear

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:30.309 
to the back and we'll check out the rear
track<00:02:23.659> bar<00:02:27.849> okay<00:02:28.849> there<00:02:29.359> is<00:02:29.629> the<00:02:29.659> rear<00:02:30.019> track

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
track bar okay there is the rear track

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.589 
track bar okay there is the rear track
bar<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:30.620> let<00:02:30.920> me<00:02:31.010> tell<00:02:31.220> you<00:02:31.340> something<00:02:31.700> these

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
bar and let me tell you something these

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.819 
bar and let me tell you something these
were<00:02:32.870> t-55<00:02:33.739> torques<00:02:34.310> and<00:02:34.959> they<00:02:35.959> were<00:02:36.019> just<00:02:36.739> a

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:36.829 
were t-55 torques and they were just a

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:39.339 
were t-55 torques and they were just a
complete<00:02:37.220> pain<00:02:37.459> in<00:02:37.609> the<00:02:37.760> ass<00:02:37.879> to<00:02:38.629> get<00:02:38.780> off<00:02:38.959> and

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
complete pain in the ass to get off and

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.470 
complete pain in the ass to get off and
I<00:02:40.159> wasn't<00:02:40.579> gonna<00:02:40.700> mess<00:02:40.909> with<00:02:40.939> getting<00:02:41.359> them

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
I wasn't gonna mess with getting them

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.170 
I wasn't gonna mess with getting them
back<00:02:41.629> on<00:02:41.900> so<00:02:42.739> I<00:02:42.769> went<00:02:43.099> ahead<00:02:43.190> and<00:02:43.370> just<00:02:43.549> got<00:02:43.909> new

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
back on so I went ahead and just got new

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.890 
back on so I went ahead and just got new
new<00:02:44.810> bolts<00:02:45.560> and<00:02:45.739> new<00:02:45.859> nuts<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:47.420> right<00:02:47.599> size

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
new bolts and new nuts the right size

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.080 
new bolts and new nuts the right size
and<00:02:47.930> put<00:02:48.290> those<00:02:48.470> in<00:02:48.769> so<00:02:49.010> I<00:02:49.040> can<00:02:49.280> easily<00:02:49.430> get

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
and put those in so I can easily get

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.460 
and put those in so I can easily get
some<00:02:50.329> torque<00:02:50.599> on<00:02:50.780> them<00:02:50.900> because<00:02:51.019> those<00:02:51.230> things

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
some torque on them because those things

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.390 
some torque on them because those things
were<00:02:51.590> stuck<00:02:51.889> on<00:02:52.069> there<00:02:52.310> so<00:02:52.579> this<00:02:53.480> thing<00:02:53.810> is

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
were stuck on there so this thing is

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.559 
were stuck on there so this thing is
adjusted<00:02:55.400> as<00:02:55.519> good<00:02:55.730> as<00:02:55.849> we<00:02:55.939> can<00:02:56.120> get<00:02:56.269> it<00:02:56.389> right

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
adjusted as good as we can get it right

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.920 
adjusted as good as we can get it right
now<00:02:56.750> and<00:02:57.730> we'll<00:02:58.730> get<00:02:58.819> the<00:02:59.000> coil<00:02:59.329> spacers<00:02:59.780> on

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
now and we'll get the coil spacers on

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:00.970 
now and we'll get the coil spacers on
there<00:03:00.139> we're<00:03:00.319> going<00:03:00.409> to<00:03:00.500> go<00:03:00.590> out<00:03:00.709> to<00:03:00.889> the

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
there we're going to go out to the

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.819 
there we're going to go out to the
military<00:03:01.310> base<00:03:01.760> my<00:03:02.629> buddy<00:03:02.870> has<00:03:03.079> access<00:03:03.590> to<00:03:03.620> a

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
military base my buddy has access to a

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:05.349 
military base my buddy has access to a
lift<00:03:04.129> out<00:03:04.370> there<00:03:04.579> so<00:03:04.819> we'll<00:03:04.939> get<00:03:05.090> the<00:03:05.209> whole

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:05.359 
lift out there so we'll get the whole

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:07.030 
lift out there so we'll get the whole
Jeep<00:03:05.599> up<00:03:05.750> on<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:06.049> lift<00:03:06.290> with<00:03:06.500> the<00:03:06.620> axles

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
Jeep up on the lift with the axles

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.280 
Jeep up on the lift with the axles
hanging<00:03:07.340> down<00:03:07.519> get<00:03:08.180> the<00:03:08.329> coil<00:03:08.569> spacers<00:03:09.109> on

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
hanging down get the coil spacers on

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.009

there<00:03:09.560> then<00:03:10.189> get<00:03:10.939> all<00:03:11.060> this<00:03:11.180> stuff<00:03:11.450> dialed<00:03:11.870> in

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
there then get all this stuff dialed in

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:13.179 
there then get all this stuff dialed in
and<00:03:12.170> get<00:03:12.319> my<00:03:12.439> straps

and get my straps
you<00:03:13.430> know<00:03:13.810> readjusted<00:03:14.810> because<00:03:14.989> we're<00:03:15.139> going

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
you know readjusted because we're going

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.170 
you know readjusted because we're going
to<00:03:15.319> have<00:03:15.500> to<00:03:15.709> mess<00:03:15.980> with<00:03:16.160> those<00:03:16.340> once<00:03:16.910> it's<00:03:17.090> a

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
to have to mess with those once it's a

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.809 
to have to mess with those once it's a
little<00:03:17.419> higher<00:03:17.629> make<00:03:18.560> sure<00:03:18.739> that<00:03:19.010> you<00:03:19.699> know

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
little higher make sure that you know

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:21.699 
little higher make sure that you know
the<00:03:20.000> suspension<00:03:20.540> is<00:03:20.629> not<00:03:20.780> stressing<00:03:21.169> itself

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
the suspension is not stressing itself

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.740 
the suspension is not stressing itself
out<00:03:21.949> braking<00:03:22.459> shocks<00:03:22.760> and<00:03:23.060> stuff<00:03:23.299> just<00:03:23.510> get

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
out braking shocks and stuff just get

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.140 
out braking shocks and stuff just get
everything<00:03:23.989> dialed<00:03:24.410> in<00:03:24.739> and<00:03:25.220> I'm<00:03:25.790> not<00:03:25.940> too

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
everything dialed in and I'm not too

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.780 
everything dialed in and I'm not too
worried<00:03:26.449> about<00:03:26.540> this<00:03:26.870> shock<00:03:27.139> right<00:03:27.409> now<00:03:27.790> I

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
worried about this shock right now I

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.000 
worried about this shock right now I
guess<00:03:29.239> these<00:03:29.449> are<00:03:29.560> you<00:03:30.560> know<00:03:30.680> they<00:03:30.859> have<00:03:30.980> a

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
guess these are you know they have a

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.890 
guess these are you know they have a
tube<00:03:31.340> on<00:03:31.519> the<00:03:31.639> inside<00:03:31.970> where<00:03:32.180> the<00:03:32.299> piston<00:03:32.480> is

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
tube on the inside where the piston is

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.479 
tube on the inside where the piston is
and<00:03:33.109> then<00:03:33.199> an<00:03:33.319> outer<00:03:33.500> tube<00:03:33.799> where<00:03:34.040> the<00:03:34.069> fluid

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
and then an outer tube where the fluid

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.939 
and then an outer tube where the fluid
goes<00:03:34.669> as<00:03:34.909> a<00:03:34.940> reservoir<00:03:35.359> and<00:03:35.810> it<00:03:36.500> looks<00:03:36.680> like<00:03:36.829> I

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:36.949 
goes as a reservoir and it looks like I

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:38.920 
goes as a reservoir and it looks like I
probably<00:03:37.159> just<00:03:37.430> damaged<00:03:37.849> the<00:03:38.060> the<00:03:38.389> reservoir

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
probably just damaged the the reservoir

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.860 
probably just damaged the the reservoir
portion<00:03:39.440> so<00:03:39.709> it's<00:03:40.099> definitely<00:03:40.639> working<00:03:41.120> so

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
portion so it's definitely working so

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.899 
portion so it's definitely working so
you<00:03:42.560> know<00:03:42.680> I'll<00:03:42.979> just<00:03:43.010> I'll<00:03:43.430> probably<00:03:43.729> keep

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:43.909 
you know I'll just I'll probably keep

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:45.819 
you know I'll just I'll probably keep
this<00:03:44.120> shock<00:03:44.389> until<00:03:44.750> I<00:03:44.810> bash<00:03:45.049> it<00:03:45.290> up<00:03:45.409> some<00:03:45.620> more

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
after I get the the coil spacers on

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.900 
after I get the the coil spacers on
there<00:04:34.480> and<00:04:34.830> the<00:04:35.830> alignment<00:04:36.130> all<00:04:36.430> dialed<00:04:36.790> in

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
there and the alignment all dialed in

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.490 
there and the alignment all dialed in
I'm<00:04:37.060> going<00:04:37.180> to<00:04:37.240> be<00:04:37.360> really<00:04:37.630> happy<00:04:37.780> with<00:04:38.080> it<00:04:38.140> so

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
I'll keep you guys posted and so far I

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
definitely recommend rusty stuff I mean

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.030 
definitely recommend rusty stuff I mean
it<00:04:45.160> looks<00:04:45.610> to<00:04:45.760> be<00:04:45.790> high<00:04:46.060> quality<00:04:46.120> and<00:04:46.900> like<00:04:47.890> I

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
it looks to be high quality and like I

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.800 
it looks to be high quality and like I
said<00:04:48.100> other<00:04:48.460> than<00:04:48.700> the<00:04:48.850> little<00:04:49.060> adjustments

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
said other than the little adjustments

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:50.940 
said other than the little adjustments
here<00:04:49.960> and<00:04:49.990> there<00:04:50.140> that<00:04:50.440> you'd<00:04:50.560> probably<00:04:50.710> have

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
here and there that you'd probably have

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.210 
here and there that you'd probably have
to<00:04:51.040> do<00:04:51.280> with<00:04:51.430> any<00:04:51.640> brand<00:04:52.140> it<00:04:53.140> does<00:04:53.590> go<00:04:53.800> on<00:04:53.830> there

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
to do with any brand it does go on there

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.940 
to do with any brand it does go on there
it<00:04:54.310> does<00:04:54.490> fit<00:04:54.730> well<00:04:54.970> and<00:04:55.470> probably<00:04:56.470> part<00:04:56.830> of

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
it does fit well and probably part of

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.590 
it does fit well and probably part of
the<00:04:57.010> reason<00:04:57.340> we<00:04:57.460> ran<00:04:57.640> into<00:04:57.850> some<00:04:58.210> fitment

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
the reason we ran into some fitment

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.540 
the reason we ran into some fitment
issues<00:04:58.720> was<00:04:59.200> because<00:04:59.590> this<00:04:59.800> is<00:04:59.950> all<00:05:00.130> pretty

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
issues was because this is all pretty

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.580 
issues was because this is all pretty
much<00:05:00.760> designed<00:05:01.240> for<00:05:01.450> six<00:05:01.750> to<00:05:01.900> eight<00:05:01.930> inches<00:05:02.410> of

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
much designed for six to eight inches of

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.650 
much designed for six to eight inches of
lift<00:05:02.770> and<00:05:03.040> right<00:05:03.610> now<00:05:03.760> I'm<00:05:03.910> only<00:05:04.060> on<00:05:04.240> four<00:05:04.540> and

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
lift and right now I'm only on four and

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.510 
lift and right now I'm only on four and
a<00:05:04.690> half<00:05:04.870> so<00:05:05.140> once<00:05:05.320> I<00:05:05.470> get<00:05:05.860> the<00:05:06.010> extra<00:05:06.310> two

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
a half so once I get the extra two

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.250 
a half so once I get the extra two
inches<00:05:06.880> and<00:05:07.090> I'm<00:05:07.180> up<00:05:07.300> in<00:05:07.450> six<00:05:07.720> and<00:05:07.870> a<00:05:07.900> half<00:05:07.930> or

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
inches and I'm up in six and a half or

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.350 
inches and I'm up in six and a half or
seven<00:05:08.470> inches<00:05:08.830> of<00:05:09.010> lift<00:05:09.160> all<00:05:09.670> this<00:05:09.940> stuff<00:05:10.210> will

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
seven inches of lift all this stuff will

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.900 
seven inches of lift all this stuff will
probably<00:05:10.660> fit<00:05:10.810> even<00:05:11.080> better<00:05:11.260> so<00:05:11.820> keep<00:05:12.820> you

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
probably fit even better so keep you

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.390 
probably fit even better so keep you
