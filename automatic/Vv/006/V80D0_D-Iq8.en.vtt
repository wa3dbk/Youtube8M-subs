00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.299
 Hello dear visitor sadovo 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:16.720
 of our website garden world today 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:19.449
 end of summer in full bloom dahlia 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:23.100
 that's about it we want with you about these 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:24.910
 flowers we talk to you today 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.730
 Unfortunately 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.130
 like all other cultures of our dahlia 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.120
 are affected by various diseases and 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:38.469
 here is one of such unpleasant diseases 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.870
 it's a mosaic virus virus disease 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:43.229
 dahlias here here we have 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.850
 plant affected just stands 

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:47.979
 look at him please carefully 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:52.870
 already will even be to the naked eye 

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:55.379
 it is clear that it is not developed and the stalks are with him 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:59.319
 small leaves 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.870
 deformed and characteristic and 

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:05.740
 such spots are yellowish which 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:10.810
 and it looks like a mosaic hence the name 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:13.869
 mosaic virus these viruses infect many 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:18.820
 plants and in this case here we have 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:21.880
 amazed here dahlia what's bad about it 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.149
 the disease is transmitted to other 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:28.030
 plants for comparison here look 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:33.759
 next to it is a perfectly healthy bush 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:35.799
 on it green smooth leaves from even 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.170
 paint and even they have a sheet 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.200
 plate it is not formed and how on 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:44.829
 tom plants that just saw 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:48.280
 here and from this sick plant on 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:51.609
 healthy this virus can can 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:55.539
 transmitted is transmitted by insects 

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:57.579
 that both pollinate and feed on nectar 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:59.799
 let's say on these colors 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:02.380
 can also be transmitted with cutting 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:05.350
 tool so if you cut 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.350
 flowers for example gia dahlias or 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.830
 cut off already faded heads 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:14.490
 please use pruner either 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.370
 somehow separate for such 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:20.220
 plants are either disinfected after 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.950
 each application but best of all I 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.890
 I advise here is a plant despite 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.790
 the fact that it blooms immediately remove from 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.400
 your garden 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.190
 The fact is that viral diseases are not 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.660
 treated for them not yet invented 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.930
 no means 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:40.410
 if we have people we are sick with viral 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:43.080
 diseases and we can take some 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.540
 preparations for plants so far 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.940
 funds are not invented ie viral 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.820
 diseases if it is already here we are 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.270
 next year we will plant and dahlia with us 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:57.630
 even smaller flowers 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:00.330
 Here are these flowers they should be 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.150
 balls round that last year 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.040
 they were and now you see they don't even 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.680
 bloom in no ball they 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.320
 flywheels they are one-sided 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.780
 and keep such a plant on just a place 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.480
 takes up in the garden absolutely no any 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.840
 sense here still I want to pay attention 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.420
 that shoots are very fragile in this 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.950
 dahlia that's worth a little touch 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:29.250
 and here these shoots of the hole immediately break 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:33.660
 let us dig this dahlia and I 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:38.660
 clearly show that my garden I do not 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:41.660
 I keep these plants here we have it 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.660
 digging up 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:51.930
 last year he was completely 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:54.630
 normal but that's probably from others 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.940
 some plants infected toilet from 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.550
 neighboring garden was brought this 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.780
 the disease toli still somehow here are many 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.570
 gardeners 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.270
 I â€™m sure I will regret it 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:09.540
 guy see signs of disease 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:12.750
 the very root of it there are no enough 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.690
 tight good and could be his water 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.390
 would save himself divided by us on 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:21.060
 here in two and everything seems to be here 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.250
 good but actually kept that 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.340
 plant makes no sense 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:30.350
 here she is next year too 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:33.630
 will be sick and it will bloom badly 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:36.930
 sure to burn such a plant in 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.930
 compost does not make it better 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:42.570
 inherit to this place 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:44.970
 dahlia next year don't plant like that 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:48.720
 what here please know about it 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:52.560
 disease again look at his 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.550
 signs such mosaic coloring 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.330
 leaves 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:05:00.470
 specks they are deformed and they are small 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:03.780
 fragile shoots and develop enough 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:06.810
 full flowers, that's all 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.940
 viral mosaic signs dahlia 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.580
 resist such plants to your 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:16.260
 such handsome men we have here 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:18.690
 bloom and pleases on this bush immediately 35 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:24.200
