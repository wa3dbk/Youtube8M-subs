at that so under the hood believe it or

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.950 
at that so under the hood believe it or
not<00:01:53.229> it's<00:01:53.920> got<00:01:54.040> the<00:01:54.190> five-o<00:01:54.930> with<00:01:55.930> a

not it's got the five-o with a
four-barrel<00:01:56.260> and<00:01:57.220> it<00:01:57.640> really<00:01:57.820> does<00:01:58.119> go<00:01:58.240> down

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
four-barrel and it really does go down

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.640 
four-barrel and it really does go down
the<00:01:58.540> road<00:01:58.659> I'll<00:01:58.810> tell<00:01:59.020> you<00:01:59.080> what<00:01:59.200> makes<00:01:59.380> a<00:01:59.500> big

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
the road I'll tell you what makes a big

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:00.960 
the road I'll tell you what makes a big
difference<00:02:00.010> is<00:02:00.130> the<00:02:00.310> four-speed<00:02:00.790> automatic

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
difference is the four-speed automatic

in here the overdrive transmission

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.270 
in here the overdrive transmission
allows<00:02:03.520> it<00:02:03.700> to<00:02:03.729> be<00:02:03.940> snappy<00:02:04.440> and<00:02:05.440> allows<00:02:06.040> it<00:02:06.070> to

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
allows it to be snappy and allows it to

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.369 
allows it to be snappy and allows it to

steering and all the goodies that go

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.910 
steering and all the goodies that go
along<00:02:20.600> it's<00:02:20.750> like<00:02:20.810> decals<00:02:21.380> are<00:02:21.590> in<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.740> right

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
along it's like decals are in the right

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.280 
along it's like decals are in the right
place<00:02:22.190> your<00:02:22.880> battery<00:02:23.300> stuff<00:02:23.660> like<00:02:23.810> that<00:02:24.050> and<00:02:24.260> I

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
place your battery stuff like that and I

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.830 
place your battery stuff like that and I
think<00:02:24.380> that<00:02:25.090> actually<00:02:26.090> go<00:02:26.210> to<00:02:26.270> a<00:02:26.360> car<00:02:26.540> show<00:02:26.720> and

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
think that actually go to a car show and

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.140 
think that actually go to a car show and
pop<00:02:27.020> the<00:02:27.170> hood<00:02:27.260> on<00:02:27.440> here<00:02:27.680> and<00:02:27.850> you<00:02:28.850> know<00:02:28.970> what<00:02:29.090> I

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
pop the hood on here and you know what I

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.520 
pop the hood on here and you know what I
would<00:02:29.300> do<00:02:29.390> I'd<00:02:29.570> probably<00:02:29.810> not<00:02:30.080> right<00:02:30.260> but<00:02:30.440> I

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
would do I'd probably not right but I

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.380 
would do I'd probably not right but I
would<00:02:30.650> almost<00:02:30.890> put<00:02:31.220> a<00:02:31.250> 3:05<00:02:31.790> decal<00:02:32.210> right

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
would almost put a 3:05 decal right

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.180 
would almost put a 3:05 decal right
there<00:02:32.570> high<00:02:32.810> output<00:02:33.260> and<00:02:33.470> it<00:02:33.980> might<00:02:34.100> look

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
there high output and it might look

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.890 
there high output and it might look
really<00:02:34.250> nice<00:02:34.640> just<00:02:34.820> to<00:02:34.940> finish<00:02:35.210> it<00:02:35.330> up<00:02:35.420> anyway

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
really nice just to finish it up anyway

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.650 
really nice just to finish it up anyway
I<00:02:36.140> think<00:02:36.560> it<00:02:36.740> looks<00:02:36.860> great<00:02:36.950> I<00:02:40.300> think<00:02:41.300> they<00:02:41.480> did

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
well why is that so what's the big deal

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.730 
well why is that so what's the big deal
about<00:04:32.210> an<00:04:32.419> 88<00:04:32.690> Monte<00:04:32.990> Carlo<00:04:33.290> being<00:04:33.470> in<00:04:33.560> great

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
about an 88 Monte Carlo being in great

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.710 
about an 88 Monte Carlo being in great
condition<00:04:34.130> well<00:04:34.250> it's<00:04:34.370> 25<00:04:34.790> years<00:04:34.820> old<00:04:35.270> that's

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
condition well it's 25 years old that's

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.190 
condition well it's 25 years old that's
why<00:04:35.960> this<00:04:36.830> is<00:04:37.010> really<00:04:37.570> difficult<00:04:38.570> to<00:04:38.870> preserve

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
why this is really difficult to preserve

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.620 
why this is really difficult to preserve
these<00:04:39.410> cars<00:04:39.740> at<00:04:39.919> this<00:04:40.010> level<00:04:40.250> and<00:04:40.550> keep<00:04:41.510> it

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
these cars at this level and keep it

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.620 
these cars at this level and keep it
rolling<00:04:41.750> the<00:04:41.990> way<00:04:42.110> they<00:04:42.260> do<00:04:42.320> but<00:04:42.710> anyway

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
rolling the way they do but anyway

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.060 
rolling the way they do but anyway
although<00:04:44.630> this<00:04:44.870> is<00:04:45.050> great<00:04:45.230> inside<00:04:45.560> it's<00:04:45.860> the

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
although this is great inside it's the

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.680 
although this is great inside it's the
drive<00:04:46.340> you<00:04:46.550> care<00:04:46.760> about<00:04:46.970> I'm<00:04:47.150> sure<00:04:47.300> the<00:04:47.480> most

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
drive you care about I'm sure the most

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.390 
drive you care about I'm sure the most
and<00:04:47.960> when<00:04:48.530> I<00:04:48.560> fire<00:04:48.800> it<00:04:48.919> up<00:04:49.010> for<00:04:49.130> you<00:04:49.190> so<00:04:49.250> you<00:04:49.340> can

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
and when I fire it up for you so you can

00:04:49.400 --> 00:05:03.140 
and when I fire it up for you so you can
hear<00:04:49.580> it<00:04:49.669> sounds<00:04:49.820> like

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.340 

all<00:05:04.150> right<00:05:04.270> so<00:05:04.360> we<00:05:04.450> got<00:05:04.570> decent<00:05:04.750> power<00:05:05.110> from

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
all right so we got decent power from

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:06.690 
all right so we got decent power from
the<00:05:05.410> v8<00:05:05.770> we<00:05:05.950> got<00:05:06.070> the<00:05:06.160> four-speed<00:05:06.670> automatic

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
the v8 we got the four-speed automatic

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.870 
the v8 we got the four-speed automatic
and<00:05:07.330> we<00:05:07.390> have<00:05:07.480> a<00:05:07.510> 373<00:05:08.440> upgraded<00:05:09.370> rear<00:05:09.400> axle

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
and we have a 373 upgraded rear axle

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.030 
and we have a 373 upgraded rear axle
ratio<00:05:09.910> here<00:05:10.450> so<00:05:10.930> at<00:05:11.050> the<00:05:11.170> overdrive<00:05:11.590> automatic

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040 
ratio here so at the overdrive automatic

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.130 
ratio here so at the overdrive automatic
transmission<00:05:12.550> it<00:05:12.640> makes<00:05:12.850> for<00:05:13.090> great<00:05:13.570> highway

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.140 
transmission it makes for great highway

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.310 
transmission it makes for great highway

the windows up and turn the a/c on you

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.060 
the windows up and turn the a/c on you
got<00:05:19.540> these<00:05:19.660> great<00:05:19.930> looking<00:05:20.200> backlit<00:05:20.620> gauges

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.310 
got these great looking backlit gauges
in<00:05:21.190> here<00:05:21.400> and<00:05:21.520> I<00:05:21.550> think<00:05:21.760> that<00:05:21.940> those<00:05:22.900> car<00:05:23.080> rolls

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
in here and I think that those car rolls

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.720 
in here and I think that those car rolls
down<00:05:23.500> the<00:05:23.530> road<00:05:23.740> and<00:05:23.980> as<00:05:24.070> it<00:05:24.190> gets<00:05:24.280> older<00:05:24.640> and

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:24.730 
down the road and as it gets older and

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.430 
down the road and as it gets older and
older<00:05:24.820> it<00:05:25.390> continues<00:05:25.870> to<00:05:25.990> go<00:05:26.140> up<00:05:26.170> in<00:05:26.290> value

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
older it continues to go up in value

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.010 
older it continues to go up in value
