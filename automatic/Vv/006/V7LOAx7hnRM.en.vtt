plates you can you can nest multiple

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.479 
plates you can you can nest multiple
parts<00:00:35.360> or<00:00:35.629> if<00:00:35.780> it's<00:00:35.960> like<00:00:36.140> a<00:00:36.170> big<00:00:36.949> part<00:00:37.280> that

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
if you using these to do multiple parts

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.250 
if you using these to do multiple parts
it's<00:00:51.290> nice<00:00:51.619> to<00:00:52.129> put<00:00:52.699> a<00:00:52.760> couple<00:00:53.030> holes<00:00:53.239> in<00:00:53.510> for

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
it's nice to put a couple holes in for

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.829 
it's nice to put a couple holes in for
picking<00:00:55.129> up<00:00:55.250> your<00:00:55.280> zeros<00:00:55.760> and<00:00:56.030> then<00:00:56.570> you<00:00:56.690> can

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:56.839 
picking up your zeros and then you can

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:00.759 
picking up your zeros and then you can
cut<00:00:57.049> a<00:00:57.080> reference<00:00:57.589> edge<00:00:57.769> to<00:00:59.589> one<00:01:00.589> of<00:01:00.680> the

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
cut a reference edge to one of the

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:03.549 
cut a reference edge to one of the
quickest<00:01:01.159> ways<00:01:01.250> is<00:01:01.580> to<00:01:02.229> if<00:01:03.229> you're<00:01:03.350> going<00:01:03.439> to

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
quickest ways is to if you're going to

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.350 
quickest ways is to if you're going to
use<00:01:03.650> these<00:01:03.830> for<00:01:04.100> a<00:01:04.129> quick-change<00:01:04.400> fixture

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
use these for a quick-change fixture

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.280 
use these for a quick-change fixture
plate<00:01:05.680> we<00:01:06.680> have<00:01:06.799> these<00:01:06.920> little<00:01:07.100> locators

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
plate we have these little locators

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.420 
plate we have these little locators
tighten<00:01:09.290> these<00:01:09.439> set<00:01:09.680> screws<00:01:09.710> down<00:01:10.159> in<00:01:10.369> the

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
tighten these set screws down in the

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.130 
tighten these set screws down in the
back<00:01:10.610> and<00:01:10.909> that's<00:01:11.479> going<00:01:11.659> to<00:01:11.720> lock<00:01:11.960> them

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
back and that's going to lock them

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:22.410 
back and that's going to lock them
against<00:01:12.530> the<00:01:12.790> t-slot<00:01:14.080> did<00:01:15.080> you<00:01:15.170> slide<00:01:15.470> in

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.540 

there's<00:01:23.420> some<00:01:23.660> plain<00:01:24.020> so<00:01:24.980> what<00:01:25.070> I'll<00:01:25.190> do<00:01:25.400> is

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
there's some plain so what I'll do is

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.960 
there's some plain so what I'll do is
just<00:01:25.760> kind<00:01:25.940> of<00:01:25.970> split<00:01:26.270> the<00:01:26.300> difference<00:01:26.600> and

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
just kind of split the difference and

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.750 
just kind of split the difference and
then<00:01:28.970> tighten<00:01:29.420> up<00:01:29.510> set<00:01:30.170> screws<00:01:30.470> to<00:01:31.370> lock<00:01:31.400> them

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
then tighten up set screws to lock them

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:42.620 
then tighten up set screws to lock them
into<00:01:31.970> position

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.160 

now<00:01:43.630> the<00:01:43.690> fixture<00:01:44.170> plate<00:01:44.410> can<00:01:44.710> lift<00:01:44.920> out<00:01:46.770> yes

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
now the fixture plate can lift out yes

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.570 
now the fixture plate can lift out yes
it's<00:01:50.170> going<00:01:50.320> to<00:01:50.410> locate<00:01:50.740> off<00:01:50.890> those<00:01:51.100> two<00:01:51.310> pins

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
it's going to locate off those two pins

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.430 
it's going to locate off those two pins
and<00:01:51.940> now<00:01:52.900> I<00:01:52.930> can<00:01:53.290> clamp<00:01:53.500> this<00:01:53.680> plate<00:01:54.370> down<00:01:54.670> and

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
and now I can clamp this plate down and

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.290 
and now I can clamp this plate down and
cut<00:01:56.440> a<00:01:56.470> reference<00:01:57.010> edge<00:01:57.220> kind<00:01:57.910> of<00:01:57.970> reference

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
cut a reference edge kind of reference

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.260 
cut a reference edge kind of reference
mark<00:01:58.570> kind<00:01:58.720> of<00:01:58.840> witness<00:01:59.110> mark<00:01:59.970> drill<00:02:00.970> and<00:02:01.120> Remo

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
mark kind of witness mark drill and Remo

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.960 
mark kind of witness mark drill and Remo
hole<00:02:01.540> whatever<00:02:01.810> I<00:02:02.020> want<00:02:02.230> and<00:02:02.440> then<00:02:02.820> then<00:02:03.820> the

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
hole whatever I want and then then the

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.790 
hole whatever I want and then then the
plates<00:02:04.210> marked<00:02:04.600> and<00:02:04.780> I<00:02:04.840> can<00:02:04.990> have<00:02:05.170> as<00:02:05.440> many<00:02:05.710> of

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
plates marked and I can have as many of

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.900 
plates marked and I can have as many of
these<00:02:05.950> plates<00:02:06.280> as<00:02:06.430> I<00:02:06.520> want<00:02:06.760> and<00:02:06.880> just

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
these plates as I want and just

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.180 
these plates as I want and just
interchange<00:02:07.450> them<00:02:07.630> they'll<00:02:08.560> just<00:02:08.590> slide<00:02:08.979> on

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
interchange them they'll just slide on

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.070 
interchange them they'll just slide on
and<00:02:09.310> off<00:02:09.429> those<00:02:09.670> pills<00:02:12.360> now<00:02:13.360> if<00:02:13.540> we<00:02:13.690> wanted<00:02:13.990> to

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
and off those pills now if we wanted to

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.620 
and off those pills now if we wanted to
use<00:02:14.260> a<00:02:14.290> bigger<00:02:14.680> plate<00:02:16.380> like<00:02:17.380> this<00:02:18.300> we<00:02:19.300> can<00:02:19.480> use

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
use a bigger plate like this we can use

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.150 
use a bigger plate like this we can use
this<00:02:19.780> other<00:02:20.020> style<00:02:20.410> of<00:02:20.740> clamps<00:02:21.250> or<00:02:21.520> locators

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
this other style of clamps or locators

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.770 
this other style of clamps or locators
locators<00:02:25.560> these<00:02:26.560> locators<00:02:27.040> you<00:02:27.850> tighten<00:02:28.360> the

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
locators these locators you tighten the

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.050 
locators these locators you tighten the
screw<00:02:29.110> through<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:29.920> doll<00:02:30.220> so<00:02:30.670> we<00:02:30.760> can<00:02:30.880> put

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
screw through the doll so we can put

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.170 
screw through the doll so we can put
them<00:02:31.150> on<00:02:31.330> locator<00:02:32.170> box<00:02:32.440> plate<00:02:33.010> and<00:02:33.970> then

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
them on locator box plate and then

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:51.940 
them on locator box plate and then
tighten<00:02:34.540> them<00:02:34.600> into<00:02:34.840> position

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.230 

again<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.100> first<00:02:53.310> time<00:02:53.520> I<00:02:53.670> put<00:02:53.850> a<00:02:53.910> fixture

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
again the first time I put a fixture

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.449 
again the first time I put a fixture
plate<00:02:54.569> on<00:02:54.780> I<00:02:55.080> would<00:02:55.440> either<00:02:55.560> just<00:02:55.920> split<00:02:56.340> the

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
plate on I would either just split the

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.360 
plate on I would either just split the
difference<00:02:56.640> in<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.120> play<00:02:57.330> in<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.750> t-slot<00:02:58.370> or

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
difference in the play in the t-slot or

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.140

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
identic ate it and edges I was though

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:13.490 
identic ate it and edges I was though
clamping<00:03:03.150> it<00:03:03.240> down

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.030 

okay<00:03:14.500> once<00:03:15.460> the<00:03:15.580> locators<00:03:16.060> are<00:03:16.240> tight<00:03:17.040> you

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
okay once the locators are tight you

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.740 
okay once the locators are tight you
could<00:03:18.250> clamp<00:03:18.550> your<00:03:18.760> fixture<00:03:19.120> down<00:03:19.300> machine

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
could clamp your fixture down machine

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.320 
could clamp your fixture down machine
your<00:03:20.520> nests<00:03:21.520> or<00:03:21.640> whatever<00:03:21.910> you're<00:03:22.090> going<00:03:22.210> to

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
your nests or whatever you're going to

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
your nests or whatever you're going to
do<00:03:22.920> and<00:03:23.920> then<00:03:24.220> this<00:03:24.400> plate<00:03:24.730> you<00:03:25.060> can<00:03:26.050> rotate<00:03:26.230> it

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.630 

and<00:03:35.350> you<00:03:35.530> can<00:03:35.680> add<00:03:35.770> multiple<00:03:35.950> plates<00:03:36.460> because

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
and you can add multiple plates because

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.010 
and you can add multiple plates because
the<00:03:36.820> hole<00:03:36.970> spacing<00:03:37.270> is<00:03:37.510> all<00:03:37.630> going<00:03:37.750> to<00:03:37.810> be<00:03:37.900> the

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 
the hole spacing is all going to be the

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.720 
the hole spacing is all going to be the
same<00:03:38.260> they'll<00:03:38.500> just<00:03:38.650> swap<00:03:39.250> it<00:03:39.280> it<00:03:39.580> up<00:03:41.580> so<00:03:42.580> if

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
same they'll just swap it it up so if

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.920 
same they'll just swap it it up so if
you<00:03:42.790> have<00:03:43.060> using<00:03:43.540> locators<00:03:44.080> to<00:03:44.670> locate<00:03:45.670> the

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
you have using locators to locate the

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.810 
you have using locators to locate the
long<00:03:46.930> edge<00:03:47.200> of<00:03:47.290> a<00:03:47.410> flat<00:03:47.800> part<00:03:48.130> you've<00:03:48.640> already

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
long edge of a flat part you've already

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.530 
long edge of a flat part you've already
had<00:03:49.060> those<00:03:49.209> in<00:03:50.370> that<00:03:51.370> is<00:03:51.580> how<00:03:52.060> to<00:03:52.120> straighten

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
had those in that is how to straighten

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.360 
had those in that is how to straighten
your<00:03:52.810> part<00:03:53.050> for<00:03:53.290> you<00:03:53.410> square<00:03:53.950> it<00:03:54.070> up<00:03:54.160> to<00:03:54.280> the

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
your part for you square it up to the

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.630 
your part for you square it up to the
Machine<00:03:54.959> and<00:03:55.959> then<00:03:56.080> you<00:03:56.170> can<00:03:56.320> use<00:03:56.470> this<00:03:56.770> for<00:03:57.610> a

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
Machine and then you can use this for a

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.880 
Machine and then you can use this for a
stop<00:03:59.580> let's<00:04:00.580> put<00:04:00.790> a<00:04:01.140> socket<00:04:02.140> head<00:04:02.290> cap<00:04:02.380> screw

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
lack it against the t-slot then you can

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:25.350 
lack it against the t-slot then you can
just<00:04:19.560> switch<00:04:20.560> your<00:04:20.590> place<00:04:23.880> then<00:04:24.880> clamp<00:04:25.180> them

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
just switch your place then clamp them

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.409
