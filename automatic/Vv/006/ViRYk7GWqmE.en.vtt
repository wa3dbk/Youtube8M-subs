00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:14.199
 good night's sleep listeners by mid-May the man is a bizarre story 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:17.460
 That is why we also supported 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.300
 herman jan and alleman who sit around until yesterday and a spontaneous yes 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.100
 firmly anchored in the sun yes 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.620
 so the car right there next also for me and without a helmet on 9 the film 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:30.979
 has been purchased 

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:33.390
 and I sat 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.440
 in the sun until I am on a terrace yes and by his internal leg that no longer in 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.730
 life was jesus yes heverlee and your car was completely past years 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.150
 a the man who had bought dead so stood under me namely all it 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.590
 even if the necessary procedures start living in c 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.960
 but i was 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.520
 you haven't got a week back 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.469
 every year a little lego is seen in the park in amsterdam yes 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.050
 and I startled my country 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.360
 to hand in English men 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.960
 was determined in for years 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.869
 from all the boys were dead 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:09.060
 well i am 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.100
 this was actually 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.820
 just through the and had already been given just give it a quiet breath yes 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.870
 but I think he did a decision on a park bench 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.310
 I am brave about all flights 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.120
 yes but i thought 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.300
 so I got out so 9 a week ago and 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.360
 the set positions well more free time a sweet was yes 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.409
 the goal is to see 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:34.760
 a place 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.710
 I attach the newspaper there 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.259
 read a hundred times with states lawsuit a fire ach and 18 years 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.460
 well you admit your opinions 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.750
 not stop that all quiet yes 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.890
 otherwise I want nothing in a mountain of snow I can now we go on again 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.460
 that stand on an eleventh cia I stand up I think for sure and I finally thought 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.850
 winter a suitcase 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.850
 give a second chance when yes that is more of a shrink 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.430
 but I will therefore be more expensive 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.110
 if there is a very very we will see 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.950
 indeed that is in a weapon 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.150
 a bizarre story where herman tuning 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.430
 those who are thinking about copying a book 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.989
 well my song 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:16.919
 terneuzen 

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:18.569
 the analytical iran 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.519
 Take Ricciardo down 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.089
 but i play piano play guitar injured only 

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:26.799
 well what i can do three years choir like that 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.829
 Okay Merkel who may have personalities on the piano 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.239
 I don't think it takes very much for them 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.209
 a man from the regime 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.069
 the ironic but maybe 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:37.269
 because to take 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.409
 it has been just a treadmill for a long time 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:40.579
 nice 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:43.579
 and hope to have a lot of fun in the new year 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:48.040
 I wish everyone a New Year's Eve then a year of yuck 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:54.180
