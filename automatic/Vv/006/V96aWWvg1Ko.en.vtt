00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.140
 it all started with a letter from my 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.950
 company they launched program 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.080
 of salary savings 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.980
 I did not understand at first open a 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.680
 count with my box 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.760
 so I said to marie ya my box 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.890
 thinks of themselves as a bank and who wants 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.880
 I tell you about salary savings 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.140
 as I already had accounts at the 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.000
 bank and that all that seemed good to me 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.490
 complicated I was going to throw the papers to 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.169
 the trash except that actually it's very 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.480
 simple it was not me who came from 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.920
 to say that sorry but you are who I 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.540
 asked someone who is precisely there 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.100
 to explain that the wage shares 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.390
 it's not complicated and he adds that 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.300
 it's even a real plus 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.530
 absolutely enjoy 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.090
 he then began to explain to me that he 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.470
 it was neither more nor less than 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.030
 account to less independent of my 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.770
 company where I was going to be able to save 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.170
 be five years in my savings account 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.250
 pay for either my retirement on my 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.230
 retirement savings account 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.700
 it seemed interesting to me but I 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.960
 still asked and why I 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.489
 would like to tell with my company 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.950
 while I already have it at the bank 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.360
 my question had hit home and there he 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.430
 started giving me real arguments 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.170
 on the bank account I could 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.190
 to make that personal payments then 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.509
 that there are several ways 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.670
 to fund my savings account 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.740
 salary and retirement but installments 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.420
 volunteers but also bonuses from my 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.190
 business participation and 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.330
 profit sharing and even days of 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.490
 leave not taken that I could 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.900
 turn into savings and when he said 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.190
 that all was additionally exempt 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.189
 of taxes I could not help but say 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.780
 of the court it's more saving for me 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:30.460
 and while I thought it was over 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.780
 he added that in addition to my business 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.520
 took care of the expenses of my 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.619
 account and can also participate in my 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.000
 payment by paying the 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.030
 big much better than my bank 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.030
 but all that seems suspicious to me 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.979
 so asked t there is a wolf that's it 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.280
 how do I do to recover my 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.500
 money 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.150
 he then reminded me that he existed 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.549
 our case of unlocking possible for the 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.659
 pe and 5 for the perco 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:54.850
 if I wanted to build myself a 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.360
 main residence you unlock if I 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.159
 wanted to get married 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.030
 you develop if I wanted three 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.460
 children killed 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.140
 and if I wanted to die you unlock 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.760
 also but all that to say that 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.080
 the salary saved is really a 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.619
 chance to seize and that's really 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.500
 interesting 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.060
 he was right so I started to 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.580
 imagine myself saving for big 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.470
 projects with married now the spared 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.940
 salary I knew what it was a 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.940
 true when to me simple and advantageous
