how<00:01:40.600> the<00:01:40.659> exhaust<00:01:41.080> comes<00:01:41.890> up<00:01:42.040> around<00:01:42.310> and<00:01:42.580> then

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
how the exhaust comes up around and then

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.060 
how the exhaust comes up around and then
out<00:01:42.909> but<00:01:43.600> this<00:01:43.720> one's<00:01:43.960> got<00:01:44.110> mufflers<00:01:44.650> on<00:01:44.830> it<00:01:44.950> or
