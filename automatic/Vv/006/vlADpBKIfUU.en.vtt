00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.020 
haven't seen like I guess I kind of got
got<00:01:07.020> put<00:01:07.260> under<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.740> radar<00:01:07.950> saying<00:01:08.369> like<00:01:08.549> well

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
got put under the radar saying like well

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.000 
got put under the radar saying like well
I<00:01:09.060> mean<00:01:09.240> we<00:01:09.390> saw<00:01:09.630> these<00:01:09.840> pictures<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.530> camels

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
I mean we saw these pictures of a camels

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.590 
I mean we saw these pictures of a camels
in<00:01:11.130> advance<00:01:11.369> warfarin<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.090> they<00:01:12.330> didn't

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
in advance warfarin and they didn't

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.510 
in advance warfarin and they didn't
really<00:01:12.630> happen<00:01:13.080> but<00:01:13.260> now<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:13.799> think<00:01:14.369> they're

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
really happen but now I think they're

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.010 
really happen but now I think they're
gonna<00:01:14.580> happen<00:01:15.030> so<00:01:15.180> this<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.540> proof<00:01:15.750> look

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
gonna happen so this is the proof look

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.060 
gonna happen so this is the proof look
at<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.229> picture<00:01:16.439> down<00:01:16.560> in<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:16.950> description

with that camo on it so that in trust me
it<00:01:29.130> doesn't<00:01:29.189> even<00:01:29.520> just<00:01:29.880> look<00:01:30.270> like<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.750> camo

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
it doesn't even just look like that camo

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.929 
it doesn't even just look like that camo
it<00:01:31.560> doesn't<00:01:31.890> just<00:01:31.920> kind<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.310> look<00:01:32.460> similar<00:01:32.790> it

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
it doesn't just kind of look similar it

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.149 
it doesn't just kind of look similar it
literally<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:34.020> camel<00:01:34.409> like<00:01:34.560> there's<00:01:34.770> no

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
literally is that camel like there's no

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.950 
literally is that camel like there's no
going<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.759> denying<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.540> it's<00:01:36.720> not<00:01:36.900> that

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
going and denying that it's not that

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.230 
going and denying that it's not that
camo<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:37.619> those<00:01:37.770> camels<00:01:38.220> are<00:01:38.400> confirmed<00:01:38.970> and

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
camo so those camels are confirmed and

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.420 
camo so those camels are confirmed and
this<00:01:39.360> makes<00:01:39.540> me<00:01:39.720> also<00:01:40.229> think<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.070> other

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
this makes me also think that the other

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.160 
this makes me also think that the other
cameras<00:01:41.939> are<00:01:42.030> going<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.210> be<00:01:42.299> confirmed<00:01:42.750> too<00:01:42.960> so

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
cameras are going to be confirmed too so

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.719 
cameras are going to be confirmed too so
that's<00:01:43.320> really<00:01:43.770> cool<00:01:43.920> gonna<00:01:44.159> have<00:01:44.280> four<00:01:44.549> new

the<00:02:27.240> fact<00:02:27.450> that<00:02:27.569> I<00:02:27.660> realized<00:02:28.319> from<00:02:28.590> this

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
the fact that I realized from this

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.470 
the fact that I realized from this
should<00:02:29.069> this<00:02:29.370> shot<00:02:29.640> of<00:02:29.790> this<00:02:29.880> guy<00:02:30.090> wearing<00:02:30.390> the

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
should this shot of this guy wearing the

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.320 
should this shot of this guy wearing the
pink<00:02:30.750> dotted<00:02:31.230> XO<00:02:31.650> soup<00:02:31.920> that<00:02:32.850> the<00:02:32.970> fact<00:02:33.209> that

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
pink dotted XO soup that the fact that

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.729 
pink dotted XO soup that the fact that
it<00:02:33.480> matched<00:02:33.690> these<00:02:33.900> cameras<00:02:34.290> from<00:02:34.440> a<00:02:34.560> month

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
it matched these cameras from a month

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.820 
it matched these cameras from a month
ago<00:02:34.890> so<00:02:35.220> again<00:02:35.910> this<00:02:36.030> isn't<00:02:36.239> 100-percent

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830
