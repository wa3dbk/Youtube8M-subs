00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.170
 hello here those of a pure screaming 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.910
 so I'll give you a little summary 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.919
 of what I like to do at five minutes I 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.720
 just broke my balls during 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:26.759
 more than five minutes to make you a 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.220
 tutorial and it's in the end of course that 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:32.610
 I noticed that my camera was spinning 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.790
 not so we will be done then I 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.070
 will explain what for so 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.730
 it is used to delete or modify a word 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.180
 password using a cd of 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.010
 gross 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.410
 so that's the software called offline 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.950
 tef password I would put it in the 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.700
 description 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.310
 here is the hour so we will create a word of 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.640
 goes on to prove that it works well 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:01:00.480
 so yes, who would believe me good so 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.210
 we will notice users modify your 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.470
 box passion passwords for 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.159
 your account new password 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:12.509
 we will put tac wow it's me 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:15.210
 you've created a password here I'm going 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:18.510
 do it windows to lock the 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.390
 session and here we went back a 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:25.430
 other pass to connect but the cd 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.180
 computers were another computer 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.220
 I hope he will not make any bets 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.220
 now little update 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:41.260
 so waouh by validating the changes 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:42.760
 boot so for my computer cf2 I'm going 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.350
 to be forced to move what you 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.240
 our cameras because it's sitting on 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.760
 the keys 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.820
 so we go in boot we select in 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.910
 first the cd key usb it depends on 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.890
 when but here I am waiting cd on 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.690
 will save and I go back 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:07.450
 the cam in much the same place 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:11.070
 discreet so we do not care we're going 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.070
 let the cddp tg put some music 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.260
 waze is already over so it took 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.380
 less 10 minutes 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:22.570
 then we press 30 res 3 I turn 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:23.970
 a little worried but a trial to what we 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:29.860
 can see that the keys 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:31.930
 but here we are, we had this guy and 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.360
 where we can not be leaving everything from 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.790
 then we will take the option of 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.560
 so the keyboard and fucking shit in 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.220
 azerty so that makes us shit in 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.390
 qwerty 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.590
 I miss every time in the 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.860
 first video I also missed 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.050
 so having qwerty so to type the 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.410
 d support on it's beautiful is 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.360
 the same 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.209
 you will see who preceded the fishermen 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.709
 then here is therefore as automatic 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.780
 it's an automatic thing 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.209
 of course it does not work for 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.040
 select the windows disk is 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.799
 installed so it does not work there 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.170
 put us 1 and we see here that there is 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:07.959
 100 megs of face a hard drive 100 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.150
 mega so it can not be windows 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.190
 which we press on two knows that the 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.049
 part in number 2 where there is 152 jitter 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.890
 it's a little better so we press 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:20.640
 enter a loan on 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:23.130
 force and windows yes that's so we do 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.250
 could enter to force windows on 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.930
 wait, we miss then on entry here 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.209
 so now we do not have any evening 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.620
 risette recovery console and leave on 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.600
 still not going away we'll do 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.110
 password reset to press then 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.910
 between say wow now edit using 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.470
 natta password register editors or 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.680
 leave we're still not leaving in 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:46.319
 business so now we have one we have 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.000
 the different welch to say different 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.110
 members but it's not members it's 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.989
 users that we have 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.660
 administrators homegroup isr so that 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.910
 will be for the network I believe guests and 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.420
 the name of the main chat session 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.580

 exactly five options available to 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:46.729
 we clear blank hÃ¼ther strainer so in 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.669
 wholesale delete the password edited the 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:52.040
 password puts the tale in 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:55.460
 administrator lemire her breasts he is 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.919
 already 4 is for them the cannonade 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.900
 account so it's used to activate or 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:01.760
 disable the user account and that 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.160
 leave we're still not leaving in 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.050
 business one must delete the word of 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.820
 pass here's the password was 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.150
 deleted password clear help 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:14.180
 we're almost done already i'll say i've 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.530
 want to say there was so we could 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.919
 actually leave because it's already 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.810
 finished 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:22.699
 we're going to hurt maj to quit 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.840
 so we have to make the options finally 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:25.610
 have to leave gomis times 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.180
 not recorded in the file that 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.360
 we just did 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:31.250
 so you have to make maj 1 to have the 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.610
 exclamation mark seen as azerty 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:38.750
 it's not the key that is his site here 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:42.020
 so here comes the edit by bringing in 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:44.000
 have made leave so we press for for 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.970
 to make 1 that one presses on to what is 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:51.050
 very logical since we are in the process ti 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:53.830
 So here you are now that they we 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.830
 ask if we want 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:06:01.320
 if you want to save the files 

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:03.810
 sam so we do it for yes we support 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.710
 on a very high lighting sam so he 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.320
 tells us that it worked well 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.040
 now we are asked to 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.419
 restart 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:13.740
 so do we start again entry and 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:17.820
 no it's good we just have to do 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:19.560
 control alt delete to restart in one 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:22.110
 game forgot to tell you about pretty much 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:25.080
 smart when we start we take off 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:29.430
 the cd to talk about booting on and 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:33.530
 well yeah so here we go cd short 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:33.530
 start windows in music 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:09.600
 ouah windows is finally launched and as we 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:12.960
 can see it welcome
