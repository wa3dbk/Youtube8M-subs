00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:55.459 
let's go downstairs and let's put in the

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:57.910 
let's go downstairs and let's put in the
finishing<00:01:55.939> touch<00:01:56.149> which<00:01:56.810> is<00:01:57.109> the<00:01:57.350> fireplace

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
finishing touch which is the fireplace

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.660 
finishing touch which is the fireplace
now<00:01:58.189> I<00:01:58.219> don't<00:01:58.459> really

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
now I don't really

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.910 
now I don't really
know<00:01:58.790> how<00:01:58.970> this<00:01:59.090> is<00:01:59.210> going<00:01:59.360> to<00:01:59.479> work<00:01:59.689> and<00:02:00.020> I

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
know how this is going to work and I

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.140 
know how this is going to work and I
think<00:02:01.400> the<00:02:01.759> only<00:02:01.970> thing<00:02:02.119> that<00:02:02.450> you<00:02:02.600> need<00:02:02.869> is

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
think the only thing that you need is

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:10.419 
think the only thing that you need is
just<00:02:05.680> your<00:02:06.680> little<00:02:07.780> fire<00:02:08.780> starter<00:02:09.410> and<00:02:09.619> I<00:02:10.190> made

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
just your little fire starter and I made

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.330 
just your little fire starter and I made
myself<00:02:10.610> a<00:02:10.880> fireplace<00:02:11.390> so<00:02:11.720> it<00:02:12.260> won't<00:02:13.130> like

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
myself a fireplace so it won't like

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.790 
myself a fireplace so it won't like
catch<00:02:13.550> the<00:02:13.580> whole<00:02:13.880> building<00:02:14.060> on<00:02:14.330> fire

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
catch the whole building on fire

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.320 
catch the whole building on fire
obviously<00:02:15.800> because<00:02:16.190> if<00:02:16.459> it<00:02:16.640> I<00:02:16.850> mean<00:02:17.090> that's

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
obviously because if it I mean that's

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.390 
obviously because if it I mean that's
just<00:02:17.569> it<00:02:17.840> doesn't<00:02:18.050> work<00:02:18.290> that<00:02:18.500> way<00:02:18.709> so<00:02:18.770> I<00:02:18.980> just

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
just it doesn't work that way so I just

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.699 
just it doesn't work that way so I just
put<00:02:19.459> the<00:02:19.850> the<00:02:20.540> wooden<00:02:20.870> block<00:02:21.110> in<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.380> middle
