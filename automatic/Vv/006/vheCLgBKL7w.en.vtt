00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.820
 the project nerd mascots are welcome 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.910
 again and I did the music that I 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.770
 I wanted this one more mascot mascot 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.010
 was to be made only of the waist 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.750
 and we also have a photo of 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.439
 idea was to make a character that 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:32.460
 had a resemblance there with the owner 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:41.070
 her and he also wanted an armor 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:42.930
 black alai knights of the zodiac on 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.700
 editing right and without being with much more 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.500
 cool the way I said in the fifth of 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:55.160
 way I said then left the 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:59.160
 Cosmos fill us up and we'll see this one 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:01.379
 spiral attention of the others the mascot 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.320
 here on our second onslaught of 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.820
 mascots logic and tomas costa being 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.159
 done here will also participate in a 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.090
 great mount is with all the mascots 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:15.689
 and will have a nice selection there of several 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.810
 characters first then again the 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.270
 skit there and a black law is normal 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.430
 with'll give a little more feature of 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.290
 People ask the blush I'm using 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.720
 bush around 5 this file is a 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.420
 little big is 2 thousand for something 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.960
 the article I then normally use of 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.780
 work with these a little worse than 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.060
 the normal resolution is always a little bit 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.490
 I did not like because you my 100% 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.090
 trait seems to get much more but it 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.040
 another 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.540
 I think this is normal and depending on the 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.790
 What am I going to do? 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.440
 So new when all I want 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.180
 a more detailed line there 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.670
 and in the name of conduct with less one is the 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.730
 that I want to make a more general trait 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.130
 I think I analyzed there myself so 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.750
 deep still rose 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.710
 psychologist 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:09.399
 Thank you I do not know only what the third 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:12.220
 remedy is not so it was whole amateur 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:15.730
 that I even thought she did not pull 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.830
 No, I did not kick it but I 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.920
 I took into account the inspiration of knights 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.900
 of the zodiac that is exactly the glove is 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.020
 the design on the arm 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:29.500
 one thing does not have one -bit arms 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:32.140
 thing in the muque names have this same is a 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.270
 very cool style of amateur and despite 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.240
 of the neck and pretended to be quite funny 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:41.710
 I think this base is a valid idea. 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:43.480
 at that time I liked as hell and 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.010
 starts the waist up ended there 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.780
 but I can make the final also not 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.960
 I liked both the idea of ​​the character but 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:53.380
 how to make the end of the cipd the cipa looks 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:56.910
 only what then expression of everything in the 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.910
 deep sealing hell 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.959
 So I did what the lice picked up and 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:05.830
 I re-read them because I wanted to find 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:09.850
 who was very ugly where he was only a savior 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.350
 The first thing that I paint then is 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.510
 part that is not mature 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.400
 Unfortunately in this part I forget to 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.310
 visit the fist part 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.430
 but I'll paint later then 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.620
 I choose the chorus 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.600
 because in this kind of thing and can pull 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.580
 The tone you want I could make the 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.890
 black armor pulled by green pulled 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:33.459
 for something else - gray I think the 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.300
 Gray gets too without too much color we 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.070
 black flame 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.640
 I remember when I was a little girl 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:42.400
 people I think of my cousins 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.709
 discussed the color of venom or 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.900
 other people do not take because it says that 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.710
 summer was blue and black vancouver in this 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.990
 there the thing it azur 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.980
 the cartoon comic he had a glow 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.230
 bluish 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.210
 but for me it 's playing black stone kabila 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.840
 she is painting the hair I spoke hair 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:03.410
 but for me it's still black the blue 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:06.080
 is the one that most easily binds the color 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:11.540
 black I think or everywhere until today 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:15.380
 It may be so I prefer this one than the 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:17.450
 Silvio will always paint some hair. 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.489
 We 're going to be black, I came to talk. 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.830
 less dark than black completes the 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:27.530
 total prize is the 10 who is the man of the 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:29.240
 things because the stroke is significant fic 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.520
 to be the most precious thing 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.830
 draw this one of the things I take 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.500
 in consideration I think runs the 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.510
 theoretical think deeply about it 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.790
 none of the institution's and how can 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.830
 do 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:45.190
 I think with art a lot can 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:50.330
 government should be 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:52.430
 the next step now so I made the 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.140
 children there is a mature child. 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:59.300
 cool photoshop that gives help to 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:05:01.040
 highlight this color and a bit of other 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.600
 things on the face 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.240
 I'm going to do tutorial people too. 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.820
 complete and how to do in photoshop one 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.490
 drawing like this one with this type 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.980
 coloring this type of contour and the 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.810
 that I use but I will do in real time and 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.120
 step by step for us to get well 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.270
 Just the same, but it will take a while. 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.130
 are still keeping up with 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.420

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.270
 priority are all projects 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:29.420
 editorial is fine and that's it people 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.620
