00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
the good shooters do is they bring the

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.540 
the good shooters do is they bring the
blade<00:02:33.330> of<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.480> stick<00:02:33.660> up<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:34.140> then<00:02:34.620> down<00:02:34.860> they

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
blade of the stick up and then down they

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.270 
blade of the stick up and then down they
basically<00:02:35.700> keep<00:02:36.180> it<00:02:36.410> parallel<00:02:37.410> with<00:02:38.130> their

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
basically keep it parallel with their

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.430 
basically keep it parallel with their
body<00:02:38.460> like<00:02:39.060> that<00:02:39.090> whereas<00:02:39.870> this<00:02:39.990> one<00:02:40.050> is<00:02:40.320> going

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
body like that whereas this one is going

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.050 
body like that whereas this one is going
to<00:02:40.560> be<00:02:40.620> rotating<00:02:41.010> behind<00:02:41.400> your<00:02:41.580> back<00:02:41.760> and

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
to be rotating behind your back and

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.880 
to be rotating behind your back and
that's<00:02:42.120> because<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:43.110> top<00:02:43.410> and<00:02:43.620> is<00:02:43.800> there

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
that's because the top and is there

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.560 
that's because the top and is there
against<00:02:44.250> hit<00:02:44.430> so<00:02:44.850> let's<00:02:45.030> take<00:02:45.150> a<00:02:45.209> look<00:02:45.390> at<00:02:45.480> that

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
against hit so let's take a look at that

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.020 
against hit so let's take a look at that
right<00:02:45.750> there<00:02:45.780> Sarah<00:02:46.740> comes<00:02:46.920> behind<00:02:47.160> you<00:02:47.520> it's

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
right there Sarah comes behind you it's

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.280 
right there Sarah comes behind you it's
like<00:02:48.120> a<00:02:48.150> golf<00:02:48.390> swing<00:02:48.510> we<00:02:48.780> don't<00:02:48.959> like<00:02:49.080> want

hands<00:02:52.650> not<00:02:53.370> far<00:02:53.970> enough<00:02:54.060> apart<00:02:54.300> you<00:02:54.660> want<00:02:54.900> that

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
hands not far enough apart you want that

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.050 
hands not far enough apart you want that
bottom<00:02:55.709> hand<00:02:55.890> basically<00:02:56.520> right<00:02:56.820> in<00:02:56.850> the

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
bottom hand basically right in the

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.080 
bottom hand basically right in the
middle<00:02:57.300> of<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.739> stick<00:02:58.739> and<00:02:59.190> it<00:02:59.340> can<00:02:59.489> be<00:02:59.520> even<00:02:59.940> a

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
middle of the stick and it can be even a

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.699 
middle of the stick and it can be even a
little<00:03:00.120> bit<00:03:00.360> further<00:03:00.570> down<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.989> shaft<00:03:01.170> but<00:03:01.530> at

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
little bit further down the shaft but at

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.350 
little bit further down the shaft but at
least<00:03:01.980> to<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.310> middle<00:03:02.610> so<00:03:02.760> you<00:03:02.790> can<00:03:02.970> get<00:03:03.090> more

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
least to the middle so you can get more

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.900 
least to the middle so you can get more
flex<00:03:03.690> out<00:03:03.840> of<00:03:03.930> that<00:03:04.020> stick<00:03:04.290> more<00:03:04.560> power<00:03:04.910> also

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
flex out of that stick more power also

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.600 
flex out of that stick more power also
legs<00:03:06.600> not<00:03:07.380> really<00:03:07.620> been<00:03:07.770> you<00:03:08.010> want<00:03:08.250> a<00:03:08.340> little

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
legs not really been you want a little

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:09.949 
legs not really been you want a little
bit<00:03:08.700> of<00:03:08.760> an<00:03:08.880> bending<00:03:09.209> your<00:03:09.300> knees<00:03:09.510> so<00:03:09.750> you<00:03:09.810> can

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
bit of an bending your knees so you can

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.060 
bit of an bending your knees so you can
really<00:03:10.110> step<00:03:10.350> in<00:03:10.560> and<00:03:10.650> get<00:03:10.739> that<00:03:10.890> weight

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
really step in and get that weight

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.920 
really step in and get that weight
transfer<00:03:11.520> so<00:03:12.150> let's<00:03:12.300> continue<00:03:12.480> through<00:03:12.870> the

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
transfer so let's continue through the

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.790 
transfer so let's continue through the
shot<00:03:13.200> here<00:03:13.730> that's<00:03:14.730> a<00:03:14.820> golf<00:03:15.030> swing<00:03:15.590> not<00:03:16.590> that

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
shot here that's a golf swing not that

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.039 
shot here that's a golf swing not that
great<00:03:17.040> for<00:03:17.100> power<00:03:17.430> and<00:03:17.670> then<00:03:18.420> for<00:03:18.989> the

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
great for power and then for the

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.570 
great for power and then for the
downswing<00:03:20.150> see<00:03:21.350> alright<00:03:22.350> so<00:03:22.500> right<00:03:22.890> here<00:03:23.519> you

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
downswing see alright so right here you

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.990 
downswing see alright so right here you
can<00:03:23.700> see<00:03:24.110> the<00:03:25.110> stick<00:03:25.799> and<00:03:26.010> the<00:03:26.400> blade<00:03:26.760> is

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
can see the stick and the blade is

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.840 
can see the stick and the blade is
basically<00:03:27.450> hitting<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:28.290> puck<00:03:29.070> what<00:03:29.640> you<00:03:29.700> want

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
basically hitting the puck what you want

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.210 
basically hitting the puck what you want
to<00:03:29.940> do<00:03:30.090> is<00:03:30.299> actually<00:03:30.840> come<00:03:31.140> down<00:03:31.170> on<00:03:31.380> a<00:03:31.410> slight

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
to do is actually come down on a slight

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.120 
to do is actually come down on a slight
angle<00:03:32.250> hid<00:03:33.120> behind<00:03:33.299> the<00:03:33.630> puck<00:03:33.870> and<00:03:34.110> the<00:03:34.980> reason

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
angle hid behind the puck and the reason

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.710 
angle hid behind the puck and the reason
that<00:03:35.310> we're<00:03:35.610> not<00:03:35.700> getting<00:03:36.060> that<00:03:36.269> is<00:03:36.480> because

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
that we're not getting that is because

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.199 
that we're not getting that is because
of<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:37.049> hand<00:03:37.260> location<00:03:37.709> so<00:03:38.160> it's<00:03:38.370> causing<00:03:38.820> the

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
of the hand location so it's causing the

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.900 
of the hand location so it's causing the
stick<00:03:39.840> to<00:03:40.500> come<00:03:40.739> straight<00:03:41.250> down<00:03:41.280> and<00:03:41.670> hit<00:03:41.790> the

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
stick to come straight down and hit the

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.490 
stick to come straight down and hit the
puck<00:03:42.090> versus<00:03:42.540> on<00:03:42.660> an<00:03:42.750> angle<00:03:43.049> so<00:03:43.350> I'm<00:03:43.410> just

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
puck versus on an angle so I'm just

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.539 
puck versus on an angle so I'm just
going<00:03:43.620> to<00:03:43.680> view<00:03:43.799> a<00:03:43.830> side-by-side<00:03:44.130> comparison

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
going to view a side-by-side comparison

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.090 
going to view a side-by-side comparison
and<00:03:45.299> I'll<00:03:45.810> show<00:03:45.989> you<00:03:46.019> how<00:03:46.560> a<00:03:46.590> pro<00:03:46.799> shoots

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
and I'll show you how a pro shoots

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.070 
and I'll show you how a pro shoots
here's<00:03:47.940> a<00:03:48.000> side-by-side<00:03:48.209> analysis<00:03:48.900> with<00:03:49.019> a

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
here's a side-by-side analysis with a

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.630 
here's a side-by-side analysis with a
pro<00:03:49.260> player<00:03:49.290> this<00:03:49.709> is<00:03:49.890> shane<00:03:50.130> doan<00:03:50.400> when<00:03:50.580> you

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
pro player this is shane doan when you

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.490 
pro player this is shane doan when you
played<00:03:50.820> with<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.120> Phoenix<00:03:51.510> Coyotes<00:03:51.630> so<00:03:52.350> let's

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
played with the Phoenix Coyotes so let's

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.310 
played with the Phoenix Coyotes so let's
take<00:03:52.860> a<00:03:52.920> look<00:03:53.160> here<00:03:53.370> first<00:03:53.880> things<00:03:54.150> you<00:03:54.239> notice

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
take a look here first things you notice

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.680 
take a look here first things you notice
looking<00:03:55.320> at<00:03:55.380> the<00:03:55.470> target<00:03:55.799> so<00:03:56.010> that's<00:03:56.130> good

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
looking at the target so that's good

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.970 
looking at the target so that's good
hands<00:03:57.690> are<00:03:57.780> far<00:03:57.959> apart<00:03:58.080> so<00:03:58.440> that<00:03:58.470> middle<00:03:58.709> of

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
hands are far apart so that middle of

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.410 
hands are far apart so that middle of
that<00:03:59.160> bottom<00:03:59.489> hand<00:03:59.640> is<00:03:59.880> about<00:04:00.120> the<00:04:00.209> middle<00:04:00.360> of

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
that bottom hand is about the middle of

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.789 
that bottom hand is about the middle of
the<00:04:00.480> shaft<00:04:00.720> it's<00:04:01.260> got<00:04:01.410> a<00:04:01.440> nice<00:04:01.530> wide<00:04:01.769> stance

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
the shaft it's got a nice wide stance

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.320 
the shaft it's got a nice wide stance
knees<00:04:02.430> are<00:04:02.610> bent<00:04:02.760> so<00:04:02.940> you<00:04:03.000> can<00:04:03.090> get<00:04:03.150> that

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
knees are bent so you can get that

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.930 
knees are bent so you can get that
weight<00:04:03.510> transfer<00:04:04.100> compared<00:04:05.100> to<00:04:05.310> this<00:04:05.700> back

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
weight transfer compared to this back

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.990 
weight transfer compared to this back
swing<00:04:06.180> here<00:04:06.420> like<00:04:07.200> I<00:04:07.290> said<00:04:07.519> hand<00:04:08.519> too<00:04:08.670> close<00:04:08.880> to

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
swing here like I said hand too close to

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.240 
swing here like I said hand too close to
the<00:04:09.060> body<00:04:09.239> bottom<00:04:10.200> hand<00:04:10.380> is<00:04:10.650> not<00:04:10.920> far<00:04:11.160> enough

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
the body bottom hand is not far enough

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.750 
the body bottom hand is not far enough
down<00:04:11.370> no<00:04:11.910> knee<00:04:11.970> bent<00:04:12.360> and<00:04:12.750> narrow<00:04:13.650> stance<00:04:13.980> so

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
down no knee bent and narrow stance so

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.259 
down no knee bent and narrow stance so
let's<00:04:14.970> continue<00:04:15.360> up<00:04:15.739> so<00:04:16.739> Shane<00:04:17.100> in<00:04:17.489> the

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
let's continue up so Shane in the

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.690 
let's continue up so Shane in the
backswing<00:04:18.720> doesn't<00:04:19.590> bring<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:19.919> stick<00:04:20.459> behind

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
backswing doesn't bring the stick behind

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.240 
backswing doesn't bring the stick behind
his<00:04:21.299> head<00:04:21.690> you<00:04:22.410> can<00:04:22.590> see<00:04:22.770> the<00:04:22.890> blade<00:04:23.070> of<00:04:23.220> the

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
his head you can see the blade of the

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.620 
his head you can see the blade of the
stick<00:04:23.520> basically<00:04:24.390> comes

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
stick basically comes

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.690 
stick basically comes
like<00:04:26.320> this<00:04:26.500> and<00:04:27.460> then<00:04:28.530> straight<00:04:29.530> down<00:04:29.560> so<00:04:30.550> then

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
like this and then straight down so then

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.090 
like this and then straight down so then
let's<00:04:31.150> look<00:04:31.330> at<00:04:31.480> the<00:04:31.540> downswing<00:04:31.930> and<00:04:32.200> the

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
let's look at the downswing and the

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.000 
let's look at the downswing and the
contact<00:04:33.610> point<00:04:34.030> so<00:04:34.990> right<00:04:35.170> there<00:04:35.230> you'll

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
contact point so right there you'll

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.810 
contact point so right there you'll
notice<00:04:36.370> that<00:04:37.230> the<00:04:38.230> blade<00:04:38.530> or<00:04:38.920> the<00:04:39.040> stick<00:04:39.250> comes

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
notice that the blade or the stick comes

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.490 
notice that the blade or the stick comes
down<00:04:39.970> an<00:04:40.090> angle<00:04:40.420> you<00:04:40.810> can<00:04:40.960> really<00:04:41.230> push

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
down an angle you can really push

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.870 
down an angle you can really push
through<00:04:41.770> with<00:04:41.890> that<00:04:41.920> bottom<00:04:42.310> hand<00:04:42.460> to<00:04:42.610> flex

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
through with that bottom hand to flex

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.090 
through with that bottom hand to flex
that<00:04:43.030> stick<00:04:43.330> contacting<00:04:44.320> the<00:04:44.410> ice<00:04:44.500> a<00:04:44.770> little

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
that stick contacting the ice a little

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.010 
that stick contacting the ice a little
bit<00:04:45.310> behind<00:04:45.460> the<00:04:45.670> puck<00:04:45.850> and<00:04:46.090> look<00:04:46.480> at<00:04:46.720> that

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
bit behind the puck and look at that

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.130 
bit behind the puck and look at that
back<00:04:47.230> leg<00:04:47.520> almost<00:04:48.520> fully<00:04:49.030> extended<00:04:49.630> getting<00:04:50.080> a

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140 
back leg almost fully extended getting a

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.710 
back leg almost fully extended getting a
lot<00:04:50.470> of<00:04:50.500> power<00:04:50.830> from<00:04:51.160> those<00:04:51.310> legs<00:04:51.640> and<00:04:51.850> you<00:04:52.600> can

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
lot of power from those legs and you can

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.500 
lot of power from those legs and you can
see<00:04:53.020> the<00:04:53.340> let's<00:04:54.340> rewind<00:04:54.640> a<00:04:54.970> little<00:04:55.060> bit<00:04:55.330> here

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
see the let's rewind a little bit here

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.140 
see the let's rewind a little bit here
so<00:04:55.690> you<00:04:56.500> can<00:04:56.620> see<00:04:56.830> the<00:04:56.980> movement<00:04:57.250> of<00:04:57.580> his<00:04:57.880> body

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
so you can see the movement of his body

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.660 
so you can see the movement of his body
so<00:04:58.420> he<00:04:58.480> can<00:04:58.630> get<00:04:58.810> all<00:04:59.380> that<00:04:59.740> weight<00:05:00.040> his

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
so he can get all that weight his

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.430 
so he can get all that weight his
movement<00:05:01.330> is<00:05:01.420> going<00:05:01.570> to<00:05:01.630> come<00:05:01.780> from<00:05:01.930> here<00:05:02.320> and

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
movement is going to come from here and

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.860 
movement is going to come from here and
then<00:05:03.130> follow<00:05:03.460> through<00:05:03.760> to<00:05:03.790> their<00:05:04.060> so<00:05:04.750> the

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
then follow through to their so the

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.230 
then follow through to their so the
watch<00:05:05.020> this<00:05:05.290> right<00:05:06.040> really<00:05:06.520> pushing<00:05:06.970> getting

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
watch this right really pushing getting

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
let's take a look at your downswing here

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.510 
let's take a look at your downswing here
so<00:05:13.540> pucks<00:05:14.440> behind<00:05:14.740> the<00:05:14.800> body<00:05:15.010> with<00:05:15.190> the<00:05:15.280> golf

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
so pucks behind the body with the golf

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.690 
so pucks behind the body with the golf
swing<00:05:15.700> coming<00:05:16.630> down<00:05:16.890> not<00:05:17.890> getting<00:05:18.160> any<00:05:18.430> power

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
swing coming down not getting any power

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.160 
swing coming down not getting any power
from<00:05:18.970> the<00:05:19.060> stick<00:05:19.360> you're<00:05:19.690> just<00:05:19.840> hitting<00:05:19.990> it

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:20.170 
from the stick you're just hitting it

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:21.540 
from the stick you're just hitting it
straight<00:05:20.350> you're<00:05:20.770> just<00:05:20.890> hitting<00:05:21.010> the<00:05:21.070> puck<00:05:21.280> so

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
straight you're just hitting the puck so

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.600 
straight you're just hitting the puck so
and<00:05:22.120> work<00:05:22.270> on<00:05:22.420> that<00:05:22.600> and<00:05:22.750> that<00:05:23.500> no<00:05:24.220> weight

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
and work on that and that no weight

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.370 
and work on that and that no weight
transfer<00:05:25.000> here<00:05:25.150> no<00:05:25.330> leg<00:05:25.600> movement<00:05:25.990> now<00:05:26.140> no

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.450 
power from that back leg so those are a

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.330 
power from that back leg so those are a
few<00:05:28.480> things<00:05:28.780> to<00:05:28.930> work<00:05:29.140> on<00:05:29.290> so<00:05:30.040> what<00:05:30.220> I'd<00:05:30.280> like

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
few things to work on so what I'd like

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.170 
few things to work on so what I'd like
to<00:05:30.580> see<00:05:31.500> get<00:05:32.500> that<00:05:32.650> hand<00:05:32.980> closer<00:05:33.610> to<00:05:34.090> the

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:35.920 
middle of the shaft bend those legs a

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.010 
middle of the shaft bend those legs a
bit<00:05:36.010> more<00:05:36.220> really<00:05:36.940> push<00:05:37.240> off<00:05:37.480> with<00:05:37.660> that<00:05:37.750> back

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800 
especially for the people who want that

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.650 
especially for the people who want that
one-on-one<00:05:54.100> feedback<00:05:54.940> on<00:05:55.120> their<00:05:55.240> shot<00:05:55.420> and

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:55.660 
one-on-one feedback on their shot and

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.600 
one-on-one feedback on their shot and
they<00:05:56.080> don't<00:05:56.170> really<00:05:56.320> have<00:05:56.530> a<00:05:56.560> coach<00:05:56.920> or<00:05:57.220> the

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
they don't really have a coach or the

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.160 
they don't really have a coach or the
coach<00:05:58.000> doesn't<00:05:58.150> have<00:05:58.360> time<00:05:58.540> to<00:05:58.600> look<00:05:58.900> at<00:05:59.050> them

00:05:59.160 --> 00:05:59.170 
coach doesn't have time to look at them

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.710 
coach doesn't have time to look at them
one-on-one<00:05:59.440> so<00:06:00.310> I<00:06:00.340> figure<00:06:00.850> working<00:06:01.480> with<00:06:01.690> a

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.720 
one-on-one so I figure working with a

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.780 
one-on-one so I figure working with a
shooting<00:06:02.140> coach<00:06:02.320> one-on-one<00:06:02.860> cost<00:06:03.640> between

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:03.790 
shooting coach one-on-one cost between

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.090 
shooting coach one-on-one cost between
$75<00:06:04.630> to<00:06:04.810> one<00:06:04.930> hundred<00:06:04.990> dollars<00:06:05.500> I'm<00:06:05.920> only

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:06.100 
$75 to one hundred dollars I'm only

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.590 
$75 to one hundred dollars I'm only
charging<00:06:06.490> twenty<00:06:06.790> dollars<00:06:07.060> so<00:06:07.150> this<00:06:07.270> probably

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:07.600 
charging twenty dollars so this probably

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.820 
charging twenty dollars so this probably
takes<00:06:07.750> me<00:06:07.870> about<00:06:07.930> an<00:06:08.110> hour<00:06:08.200> to<00:06:08.350> download<00:06:08.740> the

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
takes me about an hour to download the

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.340 
takes me about an hour to download the
video<00:06:09.070> do<00:06:09.310> the<00:06:09.430> mark-up<00:06:09.820> review<00:06:10.510> it<00:06:10.690> do<00:06:11.260> the

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:11.350 
video do the mark-up review it do the

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.020 
video do the mark-up review it do the
