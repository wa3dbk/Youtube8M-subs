00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.580
 all right 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:22.250
 in the university finis terrae not what 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.140
 I thought twice 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.359
 without thinking it to begin with 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.720
 looking for a country in South America and I 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:34.290
 really liked the idea of ​​chile and the finis 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.579
 terrae is very similar to the anahuac and 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.410
 It made the paperwork a lot easier 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.480
 investigate the university and it's a 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.699
 prestigious university they spoke very 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.769
 good of the university by another boy 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.140
 that had previously been really 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:48.420
 it's an opportunity to learn another 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.579
 culture and above all know others 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.769
 work methods because more than anything 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.109
 a new experience to learn a 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:57.560
 different culture because I first wanted 

00:00:55.109 --> 00:01:01.120
 go in a country 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:04.360
 and the best spanish jaime 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.850
 the choice between spain and chile chile 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.939
 it's like an experience that 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.799
 more incredible I think I'll decided 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:13.210
 come to the university you have land 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:15.580
 because it is a recognized university 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.290
 worldwide and is part of the network of 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.060
 Legionary colleges I can 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.530
 choose many universities around the 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:27.710
 world but how 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:30.840
 in many projects in the mega sing of 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.000
 design and in many projects 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.630
 architecture and design of chile and me 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.630
 they loved 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.619
 I really like the way of speaking or of 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.950
 being of the people is a very clean city 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.719
 very beautiful with a lot of culture I like 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.209
 that has many open spaces and 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:52.759
 open lots nature many parks 

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:57.319
 it seems a very big city you take it 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:59.000
 with some respect but then you give yourself 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:00.950
 It is a country that is neither warm 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.390
 welcomes you very easy I loved the 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.750
 mountain range I am in love and the 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.539
 cordillera a country very much 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.269
 diversity that people are super cute 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.450
 supports you at all times from the beginning 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:13.450
 in order 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.680
 I really like the order the order that 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.450
 they handle or suddenly at the moment of 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.310
 mobilize my name is last called me 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.769
 much attention on the vip card the 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.720
 amount of idioms they have can 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:30.239
 look like another awesome language to 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.180
 despite being Spanish as they have 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.430
 another language among Chinese people I 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.840
 I was not going to imagine that I would fit 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.170
 as well 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.150
 to 17,000 from my social house 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.340
 but well for that has surprised me 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.920
 pleasantly people are very kind 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.170
 I had as another concept and the truth 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.510
 that did surprise me because they are very 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.819
 warm and very kind between us or 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.400
 with what is what surprised me this 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:59.140
 is the way of speaking that is very 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.540
 different from Spanish what 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.930
 the amount of beautiful landscapes there 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.950
 I think it was different sectors 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:11.460
 we do not think that they had a high level of 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.670
 architecture and 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:17.210
 we do not think there are many places 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.210
 books 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.210
 to the entire group of foreigners we 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.670
 they got in touch with each of the 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:27.790
 responsible teachers and well a good 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.550
 process here found another another way 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.350
 to work another way to see how I 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.340
 granted the art of fact in my career 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.810
 to be a total and creative discipline 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.690
 I need to have as many points of 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.030
 view and to have an opportunity to 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.760
 be here six months to see 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.010
 how do you work in other places to me 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.930
 personally he has made videos for how 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.870
 artist supported me a lot in the sense 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.220
 of doubts the questions that I had 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.290
 they were always available for 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.800
 answer I learned them a lot from my 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.690
 teachers played me very good and very 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:06.090
 very kind they took us to 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:08.459
 excursions to factories for example the 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.170
 industrial marketing led us to a 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.780
 steel factory to know how 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:16.739
 fund companies marketing 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.799
 youtube called me your chile friends and 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:22.200
 many many friends I have roasted 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:24.510
 a lot of reel and the truth that always 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.910
 They were very good by that means 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.919
 Chilean friendships and then also from 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.320
 other countries then very very happy 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:34.610
 so many people of actions 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:38.250
 but also of Mexicans with those of 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:40.520
 giunta and everything was excellent really 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:44.000
 all my classmates treated me like 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.530
 very good of all life 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.050
 I would recommend to the university finis 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:51.020
 terrae for several reasons including the 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.150
 first I really liked the group of the 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.260
 personal way in the faculty too 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.390
 I like very much 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:59.120
 has its differences with the law and 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:00.980
 Colombia but but anyway it is 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.100
 very good very good facilities 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.900
 they are ideal 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.510
 in the accompaniment of teachers 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.790
 many would say that not only will they think two 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.320
 times they came in fact is a 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:14.620
 opportunity that I think everyone 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.820
 you should take if you have if it arises from 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.190
 fact 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.200
 I will have felt like in my house 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:23.170
 really like me like in my 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.520
 university and I will recommend it because 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:27.010
 I know that others have to come to live 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.020
 the experiences that I lived the same way 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.670
 they will go super happy with the 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.390
 experience that will happen here very 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.390
 good university 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:41.169
 is the state that is already 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:48.389
 one 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:05.980
 and he comes to study at the university 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.750
 finis terrae design because a 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:11.550
 very valid university and going to work 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:14.550
