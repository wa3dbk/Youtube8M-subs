00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.940
 sÃ©bastien here we are in germany a 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.620
 rally more for which you have the 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.210
 outgoing winner 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.010
 yes khalid more for which I will defend 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.060
 not my title necessarily but very 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.210
 happy to be here it's a little bit 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.890
 our home rally now and he 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.620
 is fine for the moment a priori it's going 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.150
 may not last 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:26.840
 the beginning he has a little complicated since 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.950
 to be canceled but we are going to try to 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.990
 find the rhythm right away 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.760
 of hand from the first special is played 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.050
 at home for volkswagen it changes 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.150
 something in the expectations of 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.800
 results 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.570
 I do not know but it's sure it's a 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.800
 important rally for for the team this 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.150
 which surely has a lot of people who will 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.570
 come this weekend and it's important to 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.460
 start to have created fans here in 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.290
 germany we see that the team is at 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.000
 complete just that proves that it's 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.230
 important to them yeah that's important 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.080
 this is the first time we have the big 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.030
 structure so has a lot of a big 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.120
 effective for a receptive speaker for 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.900
 to receive the guests 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.129
 it leaves us a little bit of that then 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.810
 here we are on asphalt with 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.210
 Germany the first in the series 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.250
 it's a rally that will suit the 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.530
 smaller car but we'll see it 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.140
 the only asphalt rally have had so far 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.760
 it's the monte carlo and it's true that 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.790
 new performance it worked rather 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:46.670
 well then we'll see what it gives here 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:48.560
 were in deutschland in mad asphalt 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:54.880
 sweet was the exact the moment this is 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.880

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.020
