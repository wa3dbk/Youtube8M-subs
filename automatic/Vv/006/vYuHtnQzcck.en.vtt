00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:08.049
 welcome to the channel 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:12.820

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.930
 that says game and well guys 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.750
 today we are going to see two more games for 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.940
 be very good cell 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:27.110
 Sun 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:28.820
 and the geometric and I will leave the links 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.980
 as a description 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.590
 good goals of young trigás that is 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.530
 to 0 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:39.150
 and you like this one that you do not have 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.150
 that he should not let himself die 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.850
 I want inspired opportunities have 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:51.309
 infinite opportunities so it's l 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.309
 ay ay ay ay can not be 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:00.560
 with the environment 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.560
 can not be 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:16.590
 and again we are a new one if you can 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.590
 be body 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.000
 of everything 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.390
 although it is now the game has its 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.390
 difficulty 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:36.780
 one with another last two times better 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.780
 know how I got it so high 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.960
 last time we're going to see another 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:47.799
 there are dozens and 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.110
 also this geometry game we can 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:54.820
 change our character our taste 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:58.800
 we can do that that that 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.800
 and with the ex colon 6 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.340
 A) Yes 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:08.780
 and then we go in other ways going to the 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.780
 pastures to take out because 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.500
 and look there are strong 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.230
 as it is again 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.010
 nothing 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.390
 I 'm playing a game 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.840
 the fun games with which 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.239
 explaining more 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.080
 although it is the nerves of recording this 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.150
 dose 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.150
 today I believe in youtube 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:50.140
 beyond one without love 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.140
 we can the other 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:58.990
 but the other game is the qin pítcher 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.990
 gang 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.370
 this game 30 of good a kingdom that is 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.260
 attacked by different monsters or if 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.840
 you have soldiers all weird that 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.350
 they have to defend the kingdom and let's see 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.990
 a classic game 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.900
 we can have different units that 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.790
 What I'm going to wear is 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.659
 investment 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.659
 and let's start 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:30.290
 this bar that's why it's a cube plate 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.290
 to be able to clarify our soldiers 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.550
 the goal is to reach ten of 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:39.560
 these little soldiers to this part of here 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:42.020
 the game is not so sheet 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.610
 it's so hard it 's just cunning and 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.620
 entertainment 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.980
 I believe that if I have everything improved like this 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.980
 not 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.870
 will see us in a big thing 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.209
 we're going to have what the pirate is like 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.530
 of the pirates the ones that spins the most 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:04.720
 here 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.940
 if any enemy passes from that path it goes to 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.530
 explode because they are like mines 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.140
 antipersonal to see if the days 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:15.510
 included 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.510
 obviously we have never got angry 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.390
 like a very funny I recommend you 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.710
 but 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.700
 for now studying for 17 so 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:32.020
 we can save it is the same 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.020
 this is from an archer like 

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:36.649
 we go 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:43.960
 I have more than this just that as 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:46.870
 repeat the internal storage 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.060
 that's why for those eyes 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:53.280
 definitely install jazz until the games 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.280
 and we have won in a charger 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:59.910
 we can also go ahead and you can 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:02.420
 buy things for our courts 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.420
 as 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:09.250
 like the dragon's spear 12 back 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:11.169
 demons there are many things we can 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.730
 buy our dolls so that 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:15.370
 be better 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:18.010
 things as they are from life regeneration 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:20.980
 to improve it well, that was all 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:23.590
 do not enter into surprise game let's see 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:25.630
 one for the surprise the game is 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:31.139
 our company today crack 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:34.190
 any edition had very good big 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:38.090
 we have a new opportunity 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:42.100
 and we create a world this game is also 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:46.060
 can include what are three basic 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:49.420
 next sub pax then I abyss 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:51.940
 I had with the blog launcher that in 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:54.750
 another video show that that only has 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:57.750
 Main game moved 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.750
 bingham 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:09.770
 because without it you can not create what 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:13.240
 we were in that game well 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:16.780
 ha ha ha ha ha ha 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:18.849
 we can also fly almost the same as 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:22.160
 minecraft of fish or what this is like 

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:24.680
 more like tell us 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:27.920
 more primitive by connecting a lot of 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.780
 things but I play very funny eating 

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.409

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.599
