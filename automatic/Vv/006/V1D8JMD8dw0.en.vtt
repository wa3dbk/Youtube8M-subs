00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
seconds now it's important to note that

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.730 
seconds now it's important to note that
this<00:01:21.299> boat<00:01:21.479> was<00:01:21.630> tested<00:01:22.049> with<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.200> 24<00:01:22.710> foot

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
this boat was tested with a 24 foot

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.280 
this boat was tested with a 24 foot
custom-made<00:01:23.520> Marlin<00:01:23.880> tower<00:01:24.060> attached<00:01:24.479> as<00:01:24.750> you

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
custom-made Marlin tower attached as you

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.810 
custom-made Marlin tower attached as you
can<00:01:25.439> well<00:01:25.560> imagine<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:26.159> will<00:01:26.520> adversely

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
can well imagine that will adversely

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.730 
can well imagine that will adversely
affect<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.390> boats<00:01:27.540> performance<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:28.439> these

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
affect the boats performance so these

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.190 
affect the boats performance so these
results<00:01:29.189> are<00:01:29.280> gonna<00:01:29.400> show<00:01:29.640> our<00:01:29.790> test<00:01:30.090> 3,400<00:01:30.810> CC

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
results are gonna show our test 3,400 CC

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.679 
results are gonna show our test 3,400 CC

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.130 
solid feeling boat when taking off to
3400<00:02:08.550> has<00:02:08.759> only<00:02:09.000> about<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.270> nine<00:02:09.539> degree<00:02:09.720> bow

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
3400 has only about a nine degree bow

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.220 
3400 has only about a nine degree bow
rise<00:02:10.470> but<00:02:11.129> because<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.819> bow<00:02:11.940> is<00:02:12.090> so<00:02:12.270> far<00:02:12.540> ahead

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
rise but because the bow is so far ahead

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.559 
rise but because the bow is so far ahead
I'm<00:02:13.409> only<00:02:13.620> about<00:02:13.769> five<00:02:14.159> eight<00:02:14.489> I<00:02:14.790> did<00:02:15.420> lose

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
I'm only about five eight I did lose

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.360 
I'm only about five eight I did lose
visibility<00:02:16.200> for<00:02:16.349> quite<00:02:16.620> a<00:02:16.650> bit<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:17.069> then

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
visibility for quite a bit and then

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.880 
visibility for quite a bit and then
while<00:02:17.730> we're<00:02:17.970> on<00:02:18.090> plane<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:19.230> bow<00:02:19.409> is<00:02:19.650> still

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
while we're on plane the bow is still

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.100 
while we're on plane the bow is still
just<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.519> little<00:02:20.790> bit<00:02:20.909> above<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.239> horizon<00:02:21.540> I'd

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
just a little bit above the horizon I'd

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.500 
just a little bit above the horizon I'd
like<00:02:22.349> to<00:02:22.470> see<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.680> step<00:02:23.099> put<00:02:23.519> behind<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.299> helm

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
like to see a step put behind the helm

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.729 
like to see a step put behind the helm
so<00:02:24.659> you<00:02:24.750> can<00:02:24.870> get<00:02:24.989> just<00:02:25.170> a<00:02:25.319> little<00:02:25.500> bit<00:02:25.620> higher

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
so you can get just a little bit higher

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.350 
so you can get just a little bit higher
especially<00:02:26.010> if<00:02:26.250> you're<00:02:26.400> a<00:02:26.459> shorter<00:02:27.030> guy<00:02:27.150> like

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
especially if you're a shorter guy like

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.930 
especially if you're a shorter guy like

miles<00:02:30.150> an<00:02:30.420> hour<00:02:30.540> and<00:02:30.900> there's<00:02:31.140> a<00:02:31.200> really

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
miles an hour and there's a really

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.780
