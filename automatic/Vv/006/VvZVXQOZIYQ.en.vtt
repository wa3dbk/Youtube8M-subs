were<00:00:38.120> from<00:00:38.449> the<00:00:38.659> old<00:00:38.809> timer<00:00:39.140> from<00:00:39.409> now<00:00:39.620> I<00:00:39.890> think

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:40.699 
were from the old timer from now I think

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:44.430 
were from the old timer from now I think
there's<00:00:40.879> something<00:00:41.120> really<00:00:41.690> clever<00:00:42.470> about

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
there's something really clever about

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.500 
there's something really clever about
taking<00:00:45.440> this<00:00:45.589> kind<00:00:45.860> of<00:00:45.949> fun<00:00:46.339> aspect<00:00:47.269> and

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
taking this kind of fun aspect and

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.930 
taking this kind of fun aspect and
putting<00:00:48.320> it<00:00:48.440> in<00:00:48.530> this<00:00:48.710> place<00:00:48.979> I<00:00:49.309> mean<00:00:49.549> that<00:00:49.699> for

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
putting it in this place I mean that for

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.939 
putting it in this place I mean that for
me<00:00:50.059> it's<00:00:50.269> like<00:00:50.420> a<00:00:50.479> site-specific<00:00:50.989> work<00:00:51.619> of<00:00:51.769> art

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
me it's like a site-specific work of art

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:53.799 
me it's like a site-specific work of art
to<00:00:52.220> put<00:00:52.430> it<00:00:52.549> in<00:00:52.670> this<00:00:52.820> place<00:00:53.030> I<00:00:53.269> don't<00:00:53.720> know

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
to put it in this place I don't know

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:55.149 
to put it in this place I don't know
whether<00:00:53.989> it<00:00:54.199> would<00:00:54.320> work<00:00:54.500> in<00:00:54.710> the<00:00:54.799> same<00:00:54.979> way

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:55.159 
whether it would work in the same way

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:57.729 
whether it would work in the same way
anywhere<00:00:55.549> else<00:00:55.760> but<00:00:56.510> the<00:00:56.659> place<00:00:56.900> felt<00:00:57.260> like<00:00:57.559> it

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
anywhere else but the place felt like it

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:59.439 
anywhere else but the place felt like it
was<00:00:57.890> really<00:00:58.250> part<00:00:58.460> of<00:00:58.580> the<00:00:58.640> work<00:00:58.879> in<00:00:59.269> those

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
was really part of the work in those

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.890 
was really part of the work in those
looks<00:00:59.809> either<00:00:59.989> one<00:01:00.640> that<00:01:01.640> you<00:01:01.970> really<00:01:02.420> did<00:01:02.809> he

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
got really attracted to that you really

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.609 
got really attracted to that you really
remember<00:01:04.760> well<00:01:05.299> I<00:01:05.330> I<00:01:05.449> think<00:01:06.229> from<00:01:06.439> the<00:01:06.590> very

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
remember well I I think from the very

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:08.289 
remember well I I think from the very
beginning<00:01:07.310> there<00:01:07.460> was<00:01:07.549> something<00:01:07.909> about<00:01:08.030> this

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
beginning there was something about this

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.870 
beginning there was something about this
denim<00:01:08.750> panier<00:01:09.170> that<00:01:09.800> set<00:01:10.130> the<00:01:10.250> tone<00:01:10.490> it<00:01:10.760> was

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
denim panier that set the tone it was

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.060 
denim panier that set the tone it was
very<00:01:11.120> well<00:01:11.420> ordered<00:01:12.020> I<00:01:12.200> think<00:01:12.440> this<00:01:12.560> show<00:01:12.800> and

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
very well ordered I think this show and

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.550 
very well ordered I think this show and
and<00:01:13.340> that's<00:01:13.910> really<00:01:14.360> set<00:01:14.720> the<00:01:14.870> tone<00:01:15.080> that<00:01:15.140> it

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
and that's really set the tone that it

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.840 
and that's really set the tone that it
was<00:01:15.710> going<00:01:15.890> to<00:01:16.040> be<00:01:16.190> this<00:01:16.400> sort<00:01:16.700> of<00:01:17.170> timeless

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
was going to be this sort of timeless

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.220 
was going to be this sort of timeless
frivolity<00:01:19.850> yeah<00:01:20.150> this<00:01:20.480> this<00:01:20.840> sense<00:01:21.080> of
