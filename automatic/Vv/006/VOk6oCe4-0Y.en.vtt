Crowley will die out in the next round
will<00:01:54.600> start<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.740> if<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.070> save<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.430> run<00:01:56.579> oh<00:01:56.640> you

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
will start so if you save a run oh you

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.200 
will start so if you save a run oh you
can<00:01:57.090> have<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.780> gunner<00:01:57.960> chasing<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.619> from

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
can have the gunner chasing you from

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.359 
can have the gunner chasing you from
the<00:01:59.330> town<00:01:59.540> and<00:02:00.049> the<00:02:00.650> next<00:02:00.770> round<00:02:01.040> will<00:02:01.220> not

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
the town and the next round will not

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.940 
the town and the next round will not
start<00:02:01.700> so<00:02:02.000> I<00:02:02.240> probably<00:02:02.900> did<00:02:03.110> all<00:02:03.350> this<00:02:03.530> in<00:02:03.590> a

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
start so I probably did all this in a

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.640 
start so I probably did all this in a
round<00:02:04.220> or<00:02:04.400> two<00:02:04.630> so<00:02:05.630> it's<00:02:06.110> really<00:02:06.260> not<00:02:06.409> already

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
round or two so it's really not already

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.680 
round or two so it's really not already
going<00:02:06.890> to<00:02:06.950> find<00:02:07.130> the<00:02:07.250> other<00:02:07.280> pieces<00:02:07.640> that<00:02:08.179> was

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
going to find the other pieces that was

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:09.999 
going to find the other pieces that was
the<00:02:08.780> pack<00:02:08.959> a<00:02:08.990> punch<00:02:09.229> shell<00:02:09.500> this<00:02:09.679> is<00:02:09.800> going<00:02:09.950> to

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
the pack a punch shell this is going to

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.290 
the pack a punch shell this is going to
be<00:02:10.100> the<00:02:10.220> little<00:02:10.429> table<00:02:10.610> right<00:02:10.910> here<00:02:10.940> you<00:02:11.180> can

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
be the little table right here you can

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.110 
be the little table right here you can
just<00:02:11.330> pick<00:02:11.750> it<00:02:11.780> up<00:02:12.459> we're<00:02:13.459> going<00:02:13.580> to<00:02:13.640> go<00:02:13.760> symbol

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
just pick it up we're going to go symbol

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.330 
just pick it up we're going to go symbol
it<00:02:14.209> back<00:02:14.360> on<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.600> table<00:02:15.069> something<00:02:16.069> new<00:02:16.190> about

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
it back on the table something new about

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.770 
it back on the table something new about
this<00:02:16.580> pack<00:02:16.819> a<00:02:16.850> punch<00:02:17.090> machine<00:02:17.300> does<00:02:17.569> you<00:02:17.660> can

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
this pack a punch machine does you can

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.229 
this pack a punch machine does you can
pack<00:02:17.989> a<00:02:18.020> punch<00:02:18.290> twice<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.430> same<00:02:19.640> up<00:02:19.790> and<00:02:19.970> twice

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
pack a punch twice the same up and twice

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.220 
pack a punch twice the same up and twice
so<00:02:21.200> that's<00:02:21.800> definitely<00:02:22.040> pretty<00:02:22.400> cool<00:02:23.200> that<00:02:24.200> uh

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
so that's definitely pretty cool that uh

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.680 
so that's definitely pretty cool that uh
they<00:02:25.100> just<00:02:25.130> I<00:02:25.489> don't<00:02:25.790> think<00:02:26.120> it<00:02:26.239> actually<00:02:26.360> gets

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
they just I don't think it actually gets

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.070 
they just I don't think it actually gets
any<00:02:26.930> stronger<00:02:27.560> it<00:02:27.770> just<00:02:28.069> allows<00:02:28.489> for<00:02:29.480> your<00:02:29.630> new

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
any stronger it just allows for your new

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.540 
any stronger it just allows for your new
attachments<00:02:30.770> so<00:02:31.010> if<00:02:31.100> you<00:02:31.190> don't<00:02:31.340> like<00:02:31.430> the

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
attachments so if you don't like the

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.550 
attachments so if you don't like the
attachment<00:02:32.090> you<00:02:32.570> can<00:02:32.720> pack<00:02:32.840> a<00:02:32.900> punch<00:02:33.170> it<00:02:33.290> again

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
attachment you can pack a punch it again

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.580 
attachment you can pack a punch it again
and<00:02:34.480> you'll<00:02:35.480> get<00:02:35.630> a<00:02:35.660> new<00:02:35.840> attachment<00:02:36.350> to<00:02:36.440> which

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
and you'll get a new attachment to which

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.979 
and you'll get a new attachment to which
is<00:02:36.709> pretty<00:02:37.130> sweet<00:02:37.400> as<00:02:37.640> well<00:02:37.820> so<00:02:38.720> you're<00:02:38.930> just
