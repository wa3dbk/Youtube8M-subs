00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:17.410
 position 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:23.710
 Yes 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:24.850
 First, how strange a equation especially when the slippery road to ultimate YOUR Paris that behind Subaru generation 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:31.270
 And from the second son 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:37.090
 It is better to put in front of the load, and the rear wheel will be lighter and slippery, so as much as possible before 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:37.400
 And because it is slippery, for example, if it is the left corner now , the stand will be put on the left 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.540
 corner 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.920
 I wish it was 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:50.829
 Sit in front of you and lighten the castle and bear the load in front of you 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:55.179
 The feet I love 5 Tsube issue a leg so as to stick than the previous spike pin say this 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:56.649
 Well after knowing everything is better than going out, it's better if the front slips 

00:00:55.179 --> 00:01:00.250
 Kick me out 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:04.850
 I will try to recover the front grip 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:08.299
 Well this kind of person of my snow 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:12.200
 It is the end of the out bar 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:16.470
 In the case of a Maruhrod, it is like this 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:20.220
 I think you're down like it's held in minutes 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.000
 After all the same feeling on the net and I do not follow the steps well Nice nice too 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.440
 not really 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.030
 Also, the former is a sense of being able to play in reverse 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:32.220
 Kedomo when likely rampage city Taku you ever press the end since the outer also 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.780
 And say which way or 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.270
 For example it is there to issue both feet that it is the case of something hopper ice 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.610
 The dragon knows 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.840
 Even when I open it up 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.200
 So much considering a certain thing 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.070
 More than that 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.530
 An angle that says to change the direction like this in the buttocks 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.150
 Bike land 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.630
 If the ward 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:59.250
 In a feeling of saying 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:01.070
 And in Do not want come with the here when I thought I want slid little longer lay 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.320
 I think that I thought 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.320
 Well Come be added in such image 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:16.120
 I think it's a part of my work with braking but I should be careful about what I am 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.080
 Healed 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.500
 But more ate it Eat it and 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.130
 Journey 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.310
 No, it works here . 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.819
 I do not pay attention to the bond 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.819
 Less than play 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:39.599
 About the sometimes actively speaking and wonder if this little dangerous gone vacant over speed-kun 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:45.030
 When I was thinking of swinging my butt, I put on the front brake and put a little more on the rear brake 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:49.290
 While lay'll if only the rear brake is not slide out that only engine brake 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:52.190
 Nde become an opportunity to begin to slip by'll stepped Mochotto 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:56.520
 The point is that the van der Vader is in court 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:59.850
 Well, it's an intrusion like drift in what Motard says 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:06.510
 Zodiac front brake is also applied 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:09.290
 8 rear brake chan top jero basically its part in the straight part 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.739
 According to r 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:18.270
 Keep to finish, if possible in a straight of the time the principle 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:23.940
 But when I say it's a little overy, I think it's a little rear brake 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:26.940
 If I step on the black month household budget and the rear brake while making a little effort 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:33.630
 There are a few more at the front 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:37.950
 It yet sunk front fork is a little from four Masu little water, such as that the professional is 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:43.860
 Or 15 together a little over the rear brake and the engine brake to the place you are over before 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:46.960
 In it Nde rear is us went flows to out beyond the grip of the limit and raise 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.140
 You can bring it to oversteer 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.120
 right 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:55.500
 It feels like a bird of entry for Dartora 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.500
 It seems that it is said that it is Dhara 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:02.990
 Also while returning back in 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:08.300
 While it charged or I combined ear 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:09.260
 When it'll stepped on the benefits of role To Choi if the left corner that is not issued a nosebleed put a foot 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.120
 Suite 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.120
 At first please enter 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.079
 As it is since the drift office device state 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:26.250
 Well bamboo basket a power bar Square I open the accelerator from there beyond the clipping 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.250
 not 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.630
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:42.770
 What 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:48.120
 When there was no slide state also following that slipped like in all the time open now 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:50.380
 The state of the beginning of the slip is a little bit all the way to the drifter 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.820
 I 'm also here now 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.820
 If you want to go out with 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:03.690
 And if you're just accelerating, you'll get the grip 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:06.529
 リ ン ン リ ン グ リ ッ プ グ リ ッ プ し て ゼ ン リ ン リ ン リ ン 付 い 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:11.299
 Because Toyota has become the straight state 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:14.350
 But if the power end is fixed , keep the power end all the time 

00:05:11.299 --> 00:05:19.480
 I'll a little laid while and all the time duration min 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:23.240
 Bike to always slippery with it go a little bit crowded little tight is 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:24.630
 All the time this way because it is going 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.729
 effect 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:31.490
 Go and 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:35.390
 In it, it's only one towel that I made it one shot and I'll just go back and say 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:38.720
 If you want to make it last like 9 a now 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:42.530
 I 'll put it to sleep when I feel like I'm gripped 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:44.110
 Then so much rotational speed and likely to come out in out in you is likely more slip 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:47.150
 Even if you don't go up 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:53.180
 Utteyuu I want to set the Sagizaka sheets of feeling 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:57.290
 If there is consideration type at that time, maybe flip down 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:06:03.140
 Oh yes that's the state I'm sorry if you 're probably well today 

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:05.009
 You were today Toka Kutcher who came as Tathagata like a place where relatives such but there are not a longer 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.040
 Maybe flip down 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:09.040
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.040
 wh 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:18.120
 You're saying something frustratingly 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:19.930
 Further Mesmerize in place which is over leave grip persist because they fried thickness of one shot 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.740
 Swing debut 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.740
 You can earn flying distance 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:35.750
 It 's the same as a close friend bird, but it 's a bit over and you say it and let it go to bed 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:37.569
 If I think that I'm going to shift down and say I'm going to get the grip I said 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:41.080
 And I'll lay a little 

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:44.199
 Birds earn their distance 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:46.870
 I think that can not be so easy 

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:49.620
 Oh 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.620
 goo 

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:05.009
 Enter a yes 

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:05.009
 If it's already going on
