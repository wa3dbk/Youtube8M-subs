said plants been raised and taking a

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.040 
said plants been raised and taking a
beating<00:00:43.530> but<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:45.390> know<00:00:45.510> they've<00:00:45.780> been<00:00:45.809> doing

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
beating but you know they've been doing

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.770 
beating but you know they've been doing
pretty<00:00:46.320> well<00:00:46.440> so<00:00:46.920> far<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:47.460> mean<00:00:48.360> with<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.600> Sun

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
pretty well so far I mean with the Sun

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.529 
pretty well so far I mean with the Sun
hits<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.170> though<00:00:49.350> get<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.620> little<00:00:49.860> wildy<00:00:50.539> but

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
hits it though get a little wildy but

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.029 
hits it though get a little wildy but
then<00:00:51.690> they<00:00:51.809> bounce<00:00:52.079> right<00:00:52.289> back<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.710> next<00:00:52.920> day

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
then they bounce right back the next day

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.029 
then they bounce right back the next day
when<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.460> gets<00:00:53.610> pulling<00:00:53.940> out<00:00:54.149> in<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.329> morning

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
when it gets pulling out in the morning

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:57.889 
when it gets pulling out in the morning
so<00:00:56.039> but<00:00:56.610> anyhow<00:00:56.910> i<00:00:56.940> replant<00:00:57.449> it's<00:00:57.660> more

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
so but anyhow i replant it's more

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.900 
so but anyhow i replant it's more
spinach<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.829> he's<00:00:59.010> here<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.430> can<00:00:59.579> see<00:00:59.730> that

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
spinach and he's here you can see that

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.660 
spinach and he's here you can see that
they're<00:01:00.120> starting<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.480> sprout<00:01:00.780> up<00:01:00.989> again<00:01:01.670> and

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
they're starting to sprout up again and

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.549 
they're starting to sprout up again and
a<00:01:02.850> couple<00:01:03.149> more<00:01:03.420> down<00:01:03.570> they're<00:01:03.840> sprouting

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
a couple more down they're sprouting

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.039 
a couple more down they're sprouting
so<00:01:06.290> hopefully<00:01:07.290> this<00:01:07.500> will<00:01:07.680> work<00:01:07.740> again<00:01:09.049> just

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
so hopefully this will work again just

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.719 
so hopefully this will work again just
like<00:01:10.260> throwing<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.650> seeds<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.130> there<00:01:11.310> that's

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
like throwing the seeds in there that's

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.359 
like throwing the seeds in there that's
all<00:01:11.909> he<00:01:11.970> did<00:01:12.380> and<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.530> can<00:01:13.680> see<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:14.159> they

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
all he did and you can see that they

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.010 
all he did and you can see that they
really<00:01:15.150> really<00:01:16.130> came<00:01:17.130> out<00:01:17.250> really<00:01:17.549> nice<00:01:18.020> and

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
really really came out really nice and

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.200 
really really came out really nice and
all<00:01:19.140> i've<00:01:19.320> been<00:01:19.350> using<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:22.970> general<00:01:23.970> high<00:01:24.060> your

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
all i've been using is general high your

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.840 
all i've been using is general high your
products<00:01:24.630> max<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:25.020> grow<00:01:25.229> I've<00:01:25.830> been<00:01:26.009> putting<00:01:26.340> a

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
products max to grow I've been putting a

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.850 
products max to grow I've been putting a
teaspoon<00:01:27.450> per<00:01:27.689> gallon<00:01:27.990> sourcing<00:01:28.439> out<00:01:28.619> to

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
teaspoon per gallon sourcing out to

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.039 
teaspoon per gallon sourcing out to
attend<00:01:29.100> teaspoons<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.729> this<00:01:29.850> I've<00:01:30.750> been<00:01:30.840> using

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
attend teaspoons of this I've been using

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.319 
attend teaspoons of this I've been using
a<00:01:31.229> mild<00:01:31.409> solution<00:01:31.650> just<00:01:32.340> because<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.880> heat<00:01:33.180> and

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
a mild solution just because of heat and

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.109 
a mild solution just because of heat and
everything<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.990> didn't<00:01:34.200> want<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:35.000> stress<00:01:36.000> the

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
everything I didn't want to stress the

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.219 
everything I didn't want to stress the
plants<00:01:36.450> even<00:01:36.689> more<00:01:37.189> so<00:01:38.509> you<00:01:39.509> know<00:01:39.570> just<00:01:39.930> using

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
plants even more so you know just using

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.050 
plants even more so you know just using
a<00:01:40.259> mild<00:01:40.439> solution<00:01:40.650> they've<00:01:41.189> they've<00:01:41.610> really

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
a mild solution they've they've really

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.670 
a mild solution they've they've really
done<00:01:42.390> great<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:42.990> mean<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:44.310> can<00:01:44.430> just<00:01:44.460> see<00:01:44.759> it

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
done great I mean you can just see it

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.370 
done great I mean you can just see it
just<00:01:46.680> by<00:01:46.829> throwing<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.220> seeds<00:01:47.460> in<00:01:47.610> there

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
just by throwing the seeds in there

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.890 
just by throwing the seeds in there
so<00:01:49.280> there's<00:01:49.490> my<00:01:49.640> update<00:01:51.400> this<00:01:52.400> is<00:01:52.549> week<00:01:52.759> four<00:01:53.600> I

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
so there's my update this is week four I

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:00.580 
so there's my update this is week four I
believe<00:01:54.880> so<00:01:56.500> it<00:01:57.500> can<00:01:57.680> be<00:01:57.830> done<00:01:59.140> the<00:02:00.140> tower<00:02:00.350> has

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
believe so it can be done the tower has

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.230 
believe so it can be done the tower has
been<00:02:00.680> doing<00:02:01.250> really<00:02:01.399> good<00:02:01.610> the<00:02:01.790> temperatures

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
been doing really good the temperatures

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.350 
been doing really good the temperatures
inside<00:02:03.310> I've<00:02:04.310> been<00:02:04.580> trying<00:02:04.850> to<00:02:04.880> keep<00:02:05.090> them

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
inside I've been trying to keep them

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.450 
inside I've been trying to keep them
between<00:02:05.479> 1015<00:02:06.350> degrees<00:02:06.470> cooler<00:02:06.950> than<00:02:07.100> what<00:02:07.340> it

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
between 1015 degrees cooler than what it

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.059 
between 1015 degrees cooler than what it
is<00:02:07.549> outside<00:02:08.350> again<00:02:09.350> it's<00:02:09.500> been<00:02:09.770> throwing<00:02:09.950> the

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
is outside again it's been throwing the

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:11.949 
is outside again it's been throwing the
