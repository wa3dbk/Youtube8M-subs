look<00:00:14.309> at<00:00:14.490> face<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:15.030> face<00:00:15.240> laughing<00:00:15.630> which<00:00:16.199> is

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
look at face to face laughing which is

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.769 
look at face to face laughing which is
based<00:00:16.650> on<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.160> rule<00:00:17.789> that<00:00:18.000> Kings<00:00:18.330> could<00:00:18.600> never

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
based on the rule that Kings could never

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.439 
based on the rule that Kings could never
look<00:00:18.990> at<00:00:19.170> each<00:00:19.289> other<00:00:19.500> directly<00:00:19.970> along<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.000> file

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
look at each other directly along a file

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.349 
look at each other directly along a file
or<00:00:21.660> column<00:00:22.260> so<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:23.130> Great<00:00:23.460> King<00:00:23.850> could<00:00:24.210> not

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
or column so the Great King could not

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.859 
or column so the Great King could not
move<00:00:24.539> in<00:00:24.750> here<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.949> this<00:00:26.070> e-file<00:00:26.820> if<00:00:27.240> there

move in here and to this e-file if there

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.919 
move in here and to this e-file if there
were<00:00:27.960> not<00:00:28.109> another<00:00:28.410> piece<00:00:28.820> in<00:00:29.820> between<00:00:30.449> the

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
were not another piece in between the

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.370 
were not another piece in between the
two<00:00:31.109> pieces<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.560> two<00:00:31.679> kings<00:00:32.210> so<00:00:33.210> what<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.110> play

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
two pieces the two kings so what a play

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.750 
two pieces the two kings so what a play
could<00:00:34.649> do<00:00:34.829> is<00:00:34.980> position<00:00:35.340> its<00:00:35.790> King

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
could do is position its King

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.830 
could do is position its King
strategically<00:00:38.760> so<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.120> acts<00:00:39.300> as<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.510> rook

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
strategically so that it acts as a rook

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.950 
strategically so that it acts as a rook
with<00:00:40.649> regard<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.520> opponent's<00:00:42.000> king<00:00:42.239> and

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
with regard to the opponent's king and

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
with regard to the opponent's king and
then<00:00:43.170> just<00:00:44.270> bring<00:00:45.270> another<00:00:45.300> piece<00:00:45.920> now<00:00:46.920> the

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
then just bring another piece now the

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.190 
then just bring another piece now the
green<00:00:47.610> Kings<00:00:47.850> in<00:00:48.030> check<00:00:48.329> from<00:00:48.539> this<00:00:48.719> rook<00:00:48.989> and

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
green Kings in check from this rook and

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.779 
green Kings in check from this rook and
it<00:00:49.320> cannot<00:00:49.590> escape<00:00:49.890> by<00:00:50.160> moving<00:00:50.370> into<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.760> e

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
it cannot escape by moving into the e

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.090 
it cannot escape by moving into the e
column<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.800> we<00:00:52.800> could<00:00:52.980> use<00:00:53.180> other<00:00:54.180> pieces<00:00:54.539> to

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
column and we could use other pieces to

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.580 
column and we could use other pieces to
accomplish<00:00:56.100> this<00:00:56.309> maybe<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.850> cannon

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
accomplish this maybe the cannon

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.229 
accomplish this maybe the cannon
and<00:00:58.590> here's<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.070> cannon<00:00:59.309> mount<00:00:59.760> over<00:00:59.910> here

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
and here's the cannon mount over here

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.190 
and here's the cannon mount over here
again<00:01:00.719> it's<00:01:01.379> checkmate<00:01:02.960> or<00:01:04.129> perhaps<00:01:05.129> we<00:01:05.580> could

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
again it's checkmate or perhaps we could

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:13.010 
again it's checkmate or perhaps we could
see<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.229> different<00:01:08.810> is<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.930> different<00:01:11.720> look

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
see a different is a different look

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.200 
see a different is a different look
all<00:01:13.350> right<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:14.369> green<00:01:14.640> king<00:01:14.880> is<00:01:15.000> in<00:01:15.180> check

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
all right the green king is in check

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.149 
all right the green king is in check
from<00:01:15.659> this<00:01:15.780> red<00:01:15.960> rook<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.590> cannot<00:01:16.920> block

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
from this red rook and it cannot block

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.090 
from this red rook and it cannot block
the<00:01:17.640> attack<00:01:17.820> with<00:01:18.390> his<00:01:18.540> guard<00:01:18.900> because<00:01:19.770> then

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
the attack with his guard because then

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.590 
the attack with his guard because then
it<00:01:20.189> would<00:01:20.280> be<00:01:20.369> exposed<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:21.180> Kings<00:01:21.390> will<00:01:21.509> be

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
it would be exposed to Kings will be

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.039 
it would be exposed to Kings will be
exposed<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:22.259> this<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.560> me<00:01:23.600> here<00:01:24.600> here's

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
exposed so this is me here here's

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.350 
exposed so this is me here here's
another<00:01:25.320> example

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
another example

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.850 
another example
maybe<00:01:28.340> the<00:01:29.340> King<00:01:29.670> cannot<00:01:30.119> escape<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.290> attack

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
maybe the King cannot escape the attack

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.810 
maybe the King cannot escape the attack
from<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.130> red<00:01:32.310> rook<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:33.350> it<00:01:34.350> cannot<00:01:34.820> capture

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
from the red rook and it cannot capture

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.270 
from the red rook and it cannot capture
this<00:01:36.180> cannon<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.869> do<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.320> because<00:01:37.860> again<00:01:38.100> to

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
this cannon to do that because again to

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.120 
this cannon to do that because again to
be<00:01:38.520> facing<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.030> opponent<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.659> red<00:01:39.960> king<00:01:40.259> so

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
be facing the opponent the red king so

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.899 
be facing the opponent the red king so
these<00:01:41.250> are<00:01:41.460> all<00:01:41.549> examples<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:43.729> simple<00:01:44.729> but

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
these are all examples of the simple but

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.240 
these are all examples of the simple but

move the elephant over here to g5 this
is<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.170> great<00:02:04.469> move<00:02:04.770> because<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.369> blocks<00:02:05.670> the

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
is a great move because it blocks the

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.670 
is a great move because it blocks the
green<00:02:06.329> rope<00:02:06.570> from<00:02:06.689> coming<00:02:07.049> over<00:02:07.290> here<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.590> the

green rope from coming over here to the
f5<00:02:08.160> we<00:02:08.489> could<00:02:08.729> protect<00:02:09.060> its<00:02:09.239> King<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.890> it

the<00:03:59.310> important<00:03:59.790> thing<00:03:59.880> to<00:03:59.910> remember<00:04:00.150> is<00:04:00.900> that

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
the important thing to remember is that

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
different columns so that they don't

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.030 
different columns so that they don't
become<00:04:05.400> obstacles<00:04:05.970> to<00:04:06.959> each<00:04:07.110> other<00:04:07.410> as<00:04:07.950> you

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
become obstacles to each other as you

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.820 
become obstacles to each other as you
can<00:04:08.280> see<00:04:08.459> over<00:04:08.580> here<00:04:08.730> the<00:04:09.600> Green<00:04:09.900> has<00:04:10.080> both

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
can see over here the Green has both

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.580 
can see over here the Green has both

rooks in the B file so this is an

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.370 
rooks in the B file so this is an
obstacle<00:04:13.920> and<00:04:14.459> now<00:04:14.880> maybe<00:04:15.420> they<00:04:16.020> can<00:04:16.230> move

the<00:04:51.240> same<00:04:51.540> file<00:04:52.110> the<00:04:52.440> C<00:04:52.650> file<00:04:52.950> and<00:04:53.940> we<00:04:54.090> can't

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
the same file the C file and we can't

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.150 
the same file the C file and we can't
use<00:04:54.420> this<00:04:54.780> if<00:04:55.050> we<00:04:55.230> want<00:04:55.410> to<00:04:55.470> use<00:04:55.620> double<00:04:55.980> rook

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
use this if we want to use double rook

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.160 
use this if we want to use double rook
and<00:04:56.400> gain<00:04:56.700> a<00:04:57.000> strategy<00:04:57.570> we<00:04:57.690> don't<00:04:57.870> want<00:04:58.080> to

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.170 
and gain a strategy we don't want to

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.800 
and gain a strategy we don't want to
check<00:04:58.860> the<00:04:59.010> green<00:04:59.280> King<00:04:59.550> this<00:04:59.670> way<00:04:59.940> because

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
check the green King this way because

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.390 
check the green King this way because
the<00:05:01.140> both<00:05:01.350> of<00:05:01.380> us<00:05:01.560> will<00:05:01.770> still<00:05:01.980> be<00:05:02.040> the<00:05:02.370> same

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
the both of us will still be the same

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.910 
the both of us will still be the same
file<00:05:02.970> and<00:05:03.300> they'll<00:05:03.450> become<00:05:03.600> an<00:05:04.200> impediment<00:05:04.590> to

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:04.920 
file and they'll become an impediment to

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.550 
file and they'll become an impediment to
each<00:05:05.100> other<00:05:05.370> so<00:05:06.240> instead<00:05:06.600> we<00:05:06.810> check<00:05:07.080> the<00:05:07.260> King

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
each other so instead we check the King

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.240 
each other so instead we check the King
this<00:05:07.920> way<00:05:08.130> bringing<00:05:08.550> the<00:05:08.640> rook<00:05:08.850> to<00:05:09.390> d5<00:05:10.250> green

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
this way bringing the rook to d5 green

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.650 
this way bringing the rook to d5 green

strategy you can see the setup red rook

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.980 
strategy you can see the setup red rook
so<00:06:04.080> in<00:06:04.230> two<00:06:04.440> different<00:06:04.980> files<00:06:05.220> that's<00:06:05.670> great

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
so in two different files that's great

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.080 
so in two different files that's great
so<00:06:06.990> let's<00:06:07.200> be<00:06:07.410> I<00:06:07.520> let's<00:06:08.520> see<00:06:08.640> if<00:06:08.700> we<00:06:08.790> can<00:06:08.940> find

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:09.090 
so let's be I let's see if we can find

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:10.730 
so let's be I let's see if we can find
any<00:06:09.330> problems<00:06:09.840> or<00:06:10.020> something<00:06:10.500> we<00:06:10.560> should<00:06:10.680> be

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
any problems or something we should be

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.970 
any problems or something we should be
careful<00:06:11.040> about<00:06:12.530> red<00:06:13.530> checks<00:06:14.190> the<00:06:14.340> green<00:06:14.580> King

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:15.980 
careful about red checks the green King

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.040 
careful about red checks the green King
and<00:06:16.980> the<00:06:17.100> green<00:06:17.310> King<00:06:17.610> evades<00:06:18.180> check<00:06:18.900> by

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
and the green King evades check by

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.800 
and the green King evades check by
moving<00:06:19.260> over<00:06:19.560> here<00:06:19.590> to<00:06:19.830> d9<00:06:20.220> and<00:06:20.550> so<00:06:21.510> we<00:06:21.630> might

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:21.810 
moving over here to d9 and so we might

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.170 
moving over here to d9 and so we might
think<00:06:22.140> okay<00:06:22.440> let's<00:06:22.620> bring<00:06:22.830> this<00:06:23.010> red<00:06:23.880> rook

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180

think okay let's bring this red rook
over<00:06:24.330> here<00:06:24.960> and<00:06:25.850> we're<00:06:26.850> gonna<00:06:26.940> camp<00:06:27.270> like<00:06:27.540> this

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:27.570 
over here and we're gonna camp like this

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:28.760 
over here and we're gonna camp like this
that's<00:06:27.990> a<00:06:28.080> mistake

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:28.770 
that's a mistake

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.370 
that's a mistake
we<00:06:28.980> want<00:06:29.190> to<00:06:29.310> be<00:06:30.000> careful<00:06:30.390> because<00:06:30.780> if<00:06:31.230> we

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:31.380 
we want to be careful because if we

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.590 
we want to be careful because if we
bring<00:06:31.590> the<00:06:31.770> lift<00:06:32.160> the<00:06:32.310> green<00:06:32.610> King<00:06:33.030> come<00:06:33.360> over
