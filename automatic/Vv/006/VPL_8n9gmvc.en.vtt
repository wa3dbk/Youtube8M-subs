like take it apart put it back together

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.830 
like take it apart put it back together
but<00:01:11.159> when<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.700> go<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.880> move<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.390> for<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.630> first

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
but when you go to move it for the first

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.550 
but when you go to move it for the first
time<00:01:13.049> it's<00:01:13.320> much<00:01:13.530> easier<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.159> lift<00:01:14.670> this<00:01:15.560> with

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
time it's much easier to lift this with

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.280 
time it's much easier to lift this with
no<00:01:16.860> contents<00:01:17.490> inside<00:01:17.850> than<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.990> lift<00:01:19.140> it

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
no contents inside than it is to lift it

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.170 
no contents inside than it is to lift it
with<00:01:19.409> everything<00:01:19.830> in<00:01:19.920> there<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.310> when<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:20.970> go

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
with everything in there and when you go

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.870 
with everything in there and when you go
to<00:01:21.240> lift<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:22.040> close<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.310> lid

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
to lift it close the lid

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.249 
to lift it close the lid
I<00:01:24.259> suggest<00:01:25.970> strapping<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.090> lid<00:01:27.299> down<00:01:27.570> with

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
I suggest strapping the lid down with

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.399 
I suggest strapping the lid down with
like<00:01:28.439> one<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.799> these<00:01:29.150> tie<00:01:30.150> buckle<00:01:30.479> straps<00:01:30.840> it's

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
like one of these tie buckle straps it's

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.170 
like one of these tie buckle straps it's
much<00:01:31.710> easier<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.159> lift<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.670> it's<00:01:32.970> much<00:01:33.150> easier

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
much easier to lift and it's much easier

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.560 
much easier to lift and it's much easier
to<00:01:33.540> lift<00:01:33.780> with<00:01:34.020> somebody<00:01:34.500> helping<00:01:34.890> you

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
now all right so this is the

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.330 
now all right so this is the
divide-and-conquer<00:03:19.850> system<00:03:20.810> okay<00:03:21.410> so<00:03:21.590> you

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
divide-and-conquer system okay so you

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.110 
divide-and-conquer system okay so you
can<00:03:22.670> see<00:03:22.940> that<00:03:23.570> this<00:03:23.750> tray<00:03:24.550> this<00:03:25.550> grate<00:03:25.910> is

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
can see that this tray this grate is

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:32.680 
can see that this tray this grate is
split<00:03:26.540> into<00:03:27.700> alright<00:03:28.700> and<00:03:29.020> it<00:03:30.020> comes<00:03:30.320> with<00:03:31.690> the

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
split into alright and it comes with the

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.660 
split into alright and it comes with the
heat<00:03:32.900> deflectors<00:03:33.440> and<00:03:33.650> the<00:03:34.010> heat<00:03:34.220> deflector

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
heat deflectors and the heat deflector

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.500 
heat deflectors and the heat deflector
now<00:03:34.820> is<00:03:35.030> split<00:03:35.390> in<00:03:35.540> two<00:03:35.570> so<00:03:36.530> this<00:03:36.709> allows<00:03:37.070> you

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
now is split in two so this allows you

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.550 
now is split in two so this allows you
to<00:03:38.510> actually<00:03:39.100> run<00:03:40.100> the<00:03:40.160> heat<00:03:40.489> deflector<00:03:41.060> on

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
to actually run the heat deflector on

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.970 
to actually run the heat deflector on
one<00:03:42.560> side<00:03:44.110> let's<00:03:45.110> say<00:03:45.320> for<00:03:45.530> instance<00:03:45.590> if

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
one side let's say for instance if

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.180 
one side let's say for instance if
you're<00:03:46.130> going<00:03:46.250> to<00:03:46.340> do<00:03:47.050> some<00:03:48.050> steaks<00:03:48.380> so<00:03:49.130> you

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
you're going to do some steaks so you

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.770 
you're going to do some steaks so you
can<00:03:49.340> run<00:03:49.459> the<00:03:49.580> heat<00:03:49.760> deflector<00:03:50.209> on<00:03:50.330> one<00:03:50.540> side

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
can run the heat deflector on one side

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.810 
can run the heat deflector on one side
steaks<00:03:51.260> on<00:03:51.440> the<00:03:51.470> bottom<00:03:51.860> so<00:03:52.280> you<00:03:52.340> can<00:03:52.550> sear

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
steaks on the bottom so you can sear

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.479 
steaks on the bottom so you can sear
them<00:03:52.970> you<00:03:53.090> can<00:03:53.239> put<00:03:53.330> vegetables<00:03:53.840> on<00:03:53.959> top<00:03:54.489> run

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
them you can put vegetables on top run

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.479 
them you can put vegetables on top run
pizzas<00:03:56.060> flip<00:03:57.020> this<00:03:57.200> on<00:03:57.350> the<00:03:57.500> top<00:03:57.709> run<00:03:58.280> it<00:03:58.370> on

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
pizzas flip this on the top run it on

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.699 
pizzas flip this on the top run it on
the<00:03:58.610> top<00:03:58.790> use<00:03:59.150> it<00:03:59.300> as<00:03:59.390> your<00:03:59.480> pizza<00:03:59.810> stone<00:04:00.080> you

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
the top use it as your pizza stone you

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:01.210 
the top use it as your pizza stone you
name<00:04:00.920> it

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
name it

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.390 
name it
okay<00:04:01.760> so<00:04:02.270> you<00:04:02.660> will<00:04:02.900> notice<00:04:03.350> there<00:04:03.680> is<00:04:03.890> no<00:04:03.920> X

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
okay so you will notice there is no X
