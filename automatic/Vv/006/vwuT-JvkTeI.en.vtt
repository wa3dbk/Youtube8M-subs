 the partner of the new parquet suggestions 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.820
 based on a completed profile 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.680
 if you have new visitors on your 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.930
 The whole page has been that 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.130
 profile is and if it already one 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.510
 Unknown check by here you see 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.370

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.760
 news 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.969
 Here you can see the partner suggestions from 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.379
 parship and you will be interested 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:45.629
 something very interesting still if you 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.910
 on partner suggestions you have here 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.190
 on the right side the possibility 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.710
 to refine the whole list something 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.510
 in platinum at sport for example 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.910
 select table tennis and then you can 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.770
 go here on networld and you 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.480
 gets the partner suggestions displayed 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.980
 who are also interested in table tennis 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.870
 maybe he 's one or the other 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.030
 beneficial if he is looking for someone 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.030
 has the same sporting interest 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.760
 like myself so I go normal on that 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.229
 main profile 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.850
 Maybe the dena would be important 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.430
 the checks could do that 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.350
 here relatively simple is just yours 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.200
 cellphone number gets from parship one 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.479
 sms then that's inside a 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.740
 Enter code to enter the kandier and 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.320
 you are already a verified one 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.509
 member and that it definitely from 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.180
 advantage for you as you will see exactly 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.189
 can or maybe yours hopefully 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.990
 future partner this is a real one 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.340
 man since even a phone 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.630
 maybe he is not busy 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.630
 all of disadvantage 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.600
 here is the profile that you can do 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.780
 fill in as you wish you did 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:53.820
 certainly not done 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:55.290
 exactly we are yet again, 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.070
 Partner suggestions now, of course, with 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.159

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.780
 news 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.930
 there could be 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.280
 the different functions like there will be 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.990
 just sent along a smile 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.670
 sometimes with a message yes here you 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.470
 Please, just smile this one 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.630
 smile a smile I find personally 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.440
 not so nice now so i would 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.840
 not to make 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.610
 because just send a smile with 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.330
 it has very relative and personal it 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.940
 yes, everyone just came is then 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.080
 always send a message and then 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.260
 are you in any case on the better 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.260
 page
