00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.820
 Hello everyone, I'm glad to see you on my own 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.650
 channel and today step 6 makeup for 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.810
 newbies today I will talk about how 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.970
 wear lipstick pencil and shine 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.800
 for lips this video will actually 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.710
 short because there is no 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.130
 particular such intricacies before 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.710
 it is necessary to apply lipstick slightly 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.250
 powder lips next we take a pencil 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.710
 for lips 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.930
 it should be darker at most 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.949
 half a ton your lipstick but better if 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.620
 he will be the same tone and we start 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:45.510
 put on lips if there is no problem 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.739
 asymmetries if if symmetries then we 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.500
 about this next time 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.230
 let's talk if there is no asymmetry then we 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.019
 starting to encircle lips starting from 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.640
 corners and towards the center the most important thing is not 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:58.859
 draw eyeliner much higher 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.469
 far below the lips so that it does not 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:08.640
 it looked unnatural then a pencil 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:10.740
 you can put a little on the lips now 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.500
 take a lip brush and blend 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.020
 pencil to the center of the lips it will be us 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.600
 serve as a good substrate for lipstick 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.420
 helps lipstick last a long time and except 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.610
 That lipstick and pencil will mix and so 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.610
 way in contrast will not be visible 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.560
 best to use a flat brush 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.300
 but here I have such a flat brush 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:43.640
 slightly pointed at the end because 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:46.820
 where she is comfortable to put lipstick on the corners of her lips 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.830
 but in principle a flat brush even a brush 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.659
 for concealer small brush tree 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.970
 suitable for applying lip 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:56.180
 lipstick by the way speaking already at this stage 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.580
 when did you shade a pencil to the center 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.280
 lips then you see to get a shade 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.399
 and you can just put a transparent 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.350
 shine and this makeup will hold 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.390
 pretty good but we decided 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.230
 take advantage of lipstick lipstick better 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:14.660
 applied from a tube and not by means of 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.100
 brush I will now apply here 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:22.850
 such a lipstick from code color 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:24.800
 with such a touch I like 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.920
 texture and texture of these lipsticks 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.790
 I also apply it from the corners of my lips to 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.739
 center 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.850
 this is necessary so that it does not 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.850
 accumulated in the corners 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.340
 to lipstick is best to keep 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.510
 you need to blot the first layer 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.940
 napkin and now we can inflict 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.650
 second layer of lipstick then she will 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:04.019
 stay a lot longer 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:06.180
 my lipstick itself is shining on 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.700
 if you want to add volume to the lips and 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.069
 glitter is needed on the center of the lip 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.660
 clear gloss can be shine 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.280
 Shimmer but this case she 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.280
 transparent shine from beauty line 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.650
 cosmetics 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.400
 many will put it on the center of the lower lip and 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.400
 on top center 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.459
 also to make lips appear more 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:41.270
 full of more sensual more plump 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:43.880
 you can apply highlighter on so 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:47.590
 called onion onion cupid that is to say 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.590
 this one tick over your upper lip 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.350
 this is best applied before you 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.350
 put on lipstick 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:08.030
 well i do in the end but need to do very 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:08.030
 be careful not to whistle the lipstick 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:13.020
 in such a way I applied lipstick she 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.940
 will keep for a long time because 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.519
 the pencil serves as a good step because 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.970
 that we put two layers of lipstick apart 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.280
 Togo 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.550
 my lips look my lips are very thin 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:26.340
 but now they look more or less such 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.290
 Google because I took advantage 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.740
 first lip gloss authors 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:34.410
 highlighter and I think I hope that 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.180

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.270

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.460
