00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.680

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:16.830
 the edges because it is 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.830

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.409
 spinach 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:34.350

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.020
 place here in the middle as well as a 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.280
 line as you are watching then you are going to 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.450
 add your ham 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.450

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.870
 way you're going to do is against 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:07.030

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.590
 and this side too 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.360
 and you are going to grab 5 your strong hands 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.120

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.170
 how and we can now serve it with a 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.200
 big knife and well finite we are going to 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.030
 cut diagonally 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.130
 this is rap we are not going to cut like this 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:07.319
 half because it looks cuter we're going 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.319
 to cut well diagonally 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:15.430
 They are doors and you do not have 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:18.340
