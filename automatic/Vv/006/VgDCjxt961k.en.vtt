okay<00:00:08.590> now<00:00:08.740> we're<00:00:08.889> going<00:00:08.980> to<00:00:09.040> get<00:00:09.219> into<00:00:09.549> the

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:09.969 
okay now we're going to get into the

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:11.640 
okay now we're going to get into the
first<00:00:10.269> breaking<00:00:10.570> ball<00:00:10.749> which<00:00:11.200> would<00:00:11.379> be<00:00:11.530> the

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:11.650 
first breaking ball which would be the

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.079 
first breaking ball which would be the
primary<00:00:11.889> breaking<00:00:12.459> ball<00:00:12.639> which<00:00:12.849> would

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:13.089 
primary breaking ball which would

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:14.970 
primary breaking ball which would
probably<00:00:13.480> be<00:00:13.599> the<00:00:13.749> best<00:00:13.990> for<00:00:14.679> long-term

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:14.980 
probably be the best for long-term

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.880 
probably be the best for long-term
health<00:00:15.579> which<00:00:16.450> is<00:00:16.630> a<00:00:16.660> challenge<00:00:16.990> to<00:00:17.260> throw<00:00:17.679> in

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:17.890 
health which is a challenge to throw in

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.759 
health which is a challenge to throw in
to<00:00:18.010> execute<00:00:18.640> but<00:00:19.269> it<00:00:19.570> is<00:00:19.929> the<00:00:20.109> best<00:00:20.349> for<00:00:20.560> health

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:20.769 
to execute but it is the best for health

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:22.740 
to execute but it is the best for health
due<00:00:21.099> to<00:00:21.130> the<00:00:21.340> fact<00:00:21.609> that<00:00:21.759> the<00:00:21.939> elbow<00:00:22.359> will

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:22.750 
due to the fact that the elbow will

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.040 
due to the fact that the elbow will
always<00:00:23.109> be<00:00:23.320> above<00:00:24.130> the<00:00:24.310> shoulder<00:00:24.699> and<00:00:25.019> from<00:00:26.019> a

seams early in the introduction and I've
seen<00:00:48.699> guys<00:00:48.879> hold<00:00:49.300> it<00:00:49.480> you<00:00:49.960> guys<00:00:50.320> hold<00:00:51.039> it<00:00:51.219> here

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
seen guys hold it you guys hold it here

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:53.819 
seen guys hold it you guys hold it here
guys<00:00:52.359> have<00:00:52.600> pulled<00:00:52.840> it<00:00:53.019> off<00:00:53.109> the<00:00:53.350> horseshoe

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
guys have pulled it off the horseshoe

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:56.189 
guys have pulled it off the horseshoe
here<00:00:54.190> the<00:00:54.519> bottom<00:00:54.879> line<00:00:55.090> is<00:00:55.329> the<00:00:55.750> comfort

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
here the bottom line is the comfort

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:58.470 
here the bottom line is the comfort
level<00:00:56.379> and<00:00:56.559> the<00:00:56.920> depth<00:00:57.250> of<00:00:57.430> the<00:00:57.760> ball<00:00:58.000> in<00:00:58.239> your

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
level and the depth of the ball in your

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.200 
level and the depth of the ball in your
hand<00:00:58.870> would<00:00:59.590> be<00:00:59.760> individualized<00:01:00.760> some<00:01:01.030> guys

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
hand would be individualized some guys

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.060 
hand would be individualized some guys
like<00:01:01.480> to<00:01:01.510> get<00:01:01.809> it<00:01:01.989> in<00:01:02.140> deep<00:01:02.379> because<00:01:02.590> they<00:01:02.800> feel

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
like to get it in deep because they feel

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.249 
like to get it in deep because they feel
they<00:01:03.280> can<00:01:03.460> rotate<00:01:03.699> and<00:01:04.150> spin<00:01:04.540> the<00:01:04.780> baseball

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:05.259 
they can rotate and spin the baseball

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:07.440 
they can rotate and spin the baseball
the<00:01:05.830> goal<00:01:06.070> of<00:01:06.250> the<00:01:06.369> curveball<00:01:06.640> is<00:01:06.880> we<00:01:07.030> want<00:01:07.270> the

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
the goal of the curveball is we want the

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.050 
the goal of the curveball is we want the
ball<00:01:07.630> going<00:01:07.900> down<00:01:08.049> and<00:01:08.740> we<00:01:09.490> don't<00:01:09.729> want<00:01:09.939> to

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
ball going down and we don't want to

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.780 
ball going down and we don't want to
throw<00:01:10.210> it<00:01:10.299> too<00:01:10.600> early<00:01:10.630> in<00:01:11.200> our<00:01:11.409> mind<00:01:11.680> so<00:01:12.460> with

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
throw it too early in our mind so with

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.969 
throw it too early in our mind so with
these<00:01:13.030> grips<00:01:13.420> some<00:01:14.200> guys<00:01:14.409> need<00:01:14.740> some

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
these grips some guys need some

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:16.710 
these grips some guys need some
assistance<00:01:15.310> and<00:01:15.700> they<00:01:15.850> turn<00:01:16.060> it<00:01:16.210> into<00:01:16.360> like<00:01:16.689> a

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
assistance and they turn it into like a

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.380 
assistance and they turn it into like a
knuckle<00:01:17.110> curveball<00:01:17.590> depending<00:01:18.400> on<00:01:18.549> the<00:01:19.119> hand

trying to get to but the gist of it is

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.700 
trying to get to but the gist of it is
is<00:01:23.950> that<00:01:24.040> we<00:01:24.579> are<00:01:24.729> trying<00:01:24.970> to<00:01:25.390> think<00:01:26.079> fast<00:01:26.380> ball

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
is that we are trying to think fast ball

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.490 
is that we are trying to think fast ball
out<00:01:26.890> of<00:01:26.950> the<00:01:27.250> glove<00:01:27.490> and<00:01:27.729> when<00:01:28.299> we<00:01:28.450> get<00:01:28.689> to<00:01:28.750> this

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
out of the glove and when we get to this

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.800 
out of the glove and when we get to this
position<00:01:29.799> we<00:01:30.640> want<00:01:30.820> to<00:01:31.000> lead<00:01:31.240> with<00:01:31.420> the<00:01:31.600> ball

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
position we want to lead with the ball

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.980 
position we want to lead with the ball
almost<00:01:32.380> in<00:01:32.560> a<00:01:32.740> hammer<00:01:33.070> mechanism<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:34.570> know<00:01:34.600> as

almost in a hammer mechanism you know as

almost in a hammer mechanism you know as
far<00:01:35.470> as<00:01:35.530> releasing<00:01:36.070> the<00:01:36.399> ball<00:01:36.610> and<00:01:36.970> we<00:01:37.299> can

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
far as releasing the ball and we can

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:39.749 
far as releasing the ball and we can
make<00:01:37.780> it<00:01:37.990> rotate<00:01:38.290> I'm<00:01:39.009> not<00:01:39.280> so<00:01:39.520> concerned

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
make it rotate I'm not so concerned

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:42.179 
make it rotate I'm not so concerned
about<00:01:40.119> teaching<00:01:40.540> the<00:01:40.869> shape<00:01:41.229> I<00:01:41.500> don't<00:01:41.920> like<00:01:42.040> to

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
about teaching the shape I don't like to

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:43.920 
about teaching the shape I don't like to
get<00:01:42.310> caught<00:01:42.369> up<00:01:42.729> too<00:01:42.909> much<00:01:43.060> in<00:01:43.270> the<00:01:43.360> shape<00:01:43.659> like

get caught up too much in the shape like

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.350 
get caught up too much in the shape like
on<00:01:44.140> a<00:01:44.170> clock<00:01:44.530> let's<00:01:44.770> not<00:01:45.009> talk<00:01:45.250> about<00:01:45.280> 12<00:01:45.880> to<00:01:46.060> 6

let's<00:01:46.990> just<00:01:47.170> talk<00:01:47.380> about<00:01:47.409> that<00:01:48.399> good

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
let's just talk about that good

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.690 
let's just talk about that good
curveball<00:01:49.180> having<00:01:50.110> shape<00:01:50.530> at<00:01:50.770> the<00:01:51.189> plate<00:01:51.460> and
