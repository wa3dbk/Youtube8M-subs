00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.930
 Hello 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.019
 so today I'm going to show you 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:16.270
 the recipe of the banshee brioche 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.550
 very light brioche without butter 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.470
 which is very easy to do then for 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.919
 this recipe it goes a packet of yeast 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:26.980
 baker or yeast cube then in 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:31.480
 dry baker's yeast it's 7 g or 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:35.170
 well a cube of 20 g 500 g of flour 60 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:39.300
 g of about 200 g of thick cream 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:42.700
 and whole two eyes a little milk 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.489
 then for milk nothing complicated there 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:51.460
 actually have to calculate the weight of both 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:53.440
 games so that's 100 g both and 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.670
 then we add on 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.670
 to reach 200 grams 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.380
 There you go 

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:09.619
 now nothing more simple we are going 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:15.829
 put everything in the robot's bowl 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:25.979
 so we start with the yeast next 

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:34.850
 the flour the sugar we add a small 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:34.850
 spoon of salt eggs with milk 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:41.549
 and finally we add cream then 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.049
 now I use the sheet on my 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:48.479
 robot I have more than a mix 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:50.780
 this preparation 5 minutes at speed 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.780
 average 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.410
 so see or five minutes I'm getting 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.850
 a party that is of course it is 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.369
 still pretty sticky 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:14.440
 so that's normal so now we 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.440
 know he had to stop euros 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:38.540
 so I'm going to take off the dough 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:41.209
 of course the walls of the gol and I'm going 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:47.209
 let the dough rest for half 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:49.310
 hour three quarter of an hour so I 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.830
 let stand the dough for three 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.330
 quarter of an hour now I'm going there 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.080
 gas companies to send it is a very very 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.640
 very sticky 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:05.150
 good I'm still going to flour and my 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:07.040
 plan so I'm doing my time to his 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.250
 Roman generals and I will spend my 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.250
 share 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:19.980
 that's it and I 'm fine cleared the 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.980
 shapes and balls 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:41.960
 now get my paw for 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:44.390
 train the balls so to form the 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:48.050
 balls simply we'll take a 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:51.530
 piece of dough in his hand gives a 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:54.170
 slightly and we will have the training 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:57.140
 ball so for the ball it's between the 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:05.930
 thumb and the and the other fingers and one 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:08.000
 turn this way so here we have our 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:13.160
 food is redone with the key in 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.530
 below that's where you can 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:19.220
 insert if you want a small tile 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:25.580
 of chocolate my spoon of potatoes to 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:29.300
 Spread good otherwise let nature 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:32.350
 every day we formed 15 rounds 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.350
 from 52.7 in serious 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.650
 so I took a plate with a 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.110
 parchment paper 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.060
 you can put a circle or a frame 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.160
 where or even do it before us does it 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.400
 and now I'm going to have the 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:51.590
 balls so I still had oil 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:52.790
 slightly the frame with the paper on 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.380
 see there I think I'll do three 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.000
 rows of five 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.680
 you do not have to troll 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.680
 cereals because it will still swell 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.880
 I put my 15 balls now I 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:13.229
 will leave still there no rest 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:18.419
 a half hour three quarters 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:20.130
 of time preheat your oven to 100 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:20.520
 that's after half an hour 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.310
 bauges 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.639
 andrien lift now after 25 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:28.940
 minutes at 160 Â° the banshee brioche is 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.940
 ready 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.759
 I only have to sprinkle it 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.759
 with a little icing sugar 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:51.300
 and wait for it to cool down and good 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.300
