00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
just pops open here and then there's

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.230 
just pops open here and then there's
plenty<00:02:28.310> of<00:02:28.430> paper<00:02:28.790> on<00:02:29.210> the<00:02:29.390> inside<00:02:29.780> to<00:02:30.110> journal

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
plenty of paper on the inside to journal

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.630 
plenty of paper on the inside to journal
and<00:02:32.240> then<00:02:32.660> that<00:02:32.840> just<00:02:33.080> slides<00:02:33.290> right<00:02:33.530> back<00:02:34.010> in

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
and then that just slides right back in

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:42.550 
and then that just slides right back in
there<00:02:36.370> like<00:02:37.370> so<00:02:37.810> and<00:02:38.980> then<00:02:40.240> on<00:02:41.240> the<00:02:41.810> upper<00:02:42.020> side

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
there like so and then on the upper side

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:49.030 
there like so and then on the upper side
here<00:02:43.330> this<00:02:44.330> is<00:02:45.100> some<00:02:46.100> seam<00:02:46.340> binding<00:02:46.640> and<00:02:48.040> this

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
here this is some seam binding and this

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.420 
here this is some seam binding and this
just<00:02:49.430> opens<00:02:49.820> up<00:02:49.940> like<00:02:50.180> so<00:02:50.480> and<00:02:50.950> you<00:02:51.950> can<00:02:52.070> pretty

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
just opens up like so and you can pretty

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.020 
just opens up like so and you can pretty
much<00:02:52.520> shove<00:02:53.060> anything<00:02:53.330> you<00:02:53.780> want<00:02:54.050> in<00:02:54.260> here<00:02:55.030> so

much shove anything you want in here so

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.850 
much shove anything you want in here so
let's<00:02:56.630> just<00:02:56.840> say<00:02:56.960> you<00:02:57.020> want<00:02:57.260> to<00:02:57.320> put<00:02:57.470> this<00:02:57.620> in

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
let's just say you want to put this in

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.340 
let's just say you want to put this in
there<00:02:58.070> you<00:02:58.880> close<00:02:59.150> that<00:02:59.180> up<00:02:59.570> tie<00:02:59.810> it<00:02:59.840> up<00:03:00.140> and

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
there you close that up tie it up and

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.110 
there you close that up tie it up and
you<00:03:01.010> don't<00:03:01.100> have<00:03:01.190> to<00:03:01.370> worry<00:03:01.550> about<00:03:01.670> it<00:03:01.910> falling

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
you don't have to worry about it falling

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.360 
you don't have to worry about it falling
out<00:03:02.420> no<00:03:02.750> matter<00:03:02.930> what<00:03:03.200> how<00:03:03.710> you<00:03:03.740> carry<00:03:04.190> it

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
out no matter what how you carry it

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.080 
out no matter what how you carry it
because<00:03:04.580> it's<00:03:05.120> well-guarded<00:03:05.420> on<00:03:05.900> four<00:03:06.170> sides

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
because it's well-guarded on four sides

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:13.510 
because it's well-guarded on four sides
so<00:03:08.890> that's<00:03:10.900> I<00:03:11.980> don't<00:03:12.980> even<00:03:13.160> know<00:03:13.250> what<00:03:13.400> to<00:03:13.489> call

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
so that's I don't even know what to call

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.810 
so that's I don't even know what to call
it<00:03:14.290> it<00:03:15.290> looks<00:03:15.530> kind<00:03:15.830> of<00:03:15.890> like<00:03:16.040> a<00:03:16.070> Kleenex<00:03:16.520> box

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
it it looks kind of like a Kleenex box

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.280 
it it looks kind of like a Kleenex box
if<00:03:17.030> you<00:03:17.120> asked<00:03:17.390> me<00:03:18.160> but<00:03:19.239> let's<00:03:20.239> see<00:03:20.510> alright

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
if you asked me but let's see alright

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:27.880 
if you asked me but let's see alright
and<00:03:21.680> then<00:03:21.860> on<00:03:22.840> this<00:03:23.840> side<00:03:24.260> is<00:03:24.910> a<00:03:25.910> gatefold<00:03:26.180> or<00:03:26.989> I

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
and then on this side is a gatefold or I

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.530 
and then on this side is a gatefold or I
don't<00:03:28.370> know<00:03:28.489> I<00:03:28.790> don't<00:03:29.209> know<00:03:29.360> if<00:03:29.450> it's

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
don't know I don't know if it's

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.740 
don't know I don't know if it's
beautiful<00:03:29.989> but<00:03:30.260> it's<00:03:30.560> it's<00:03:30.950> certainly<00:03:31.190> a

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
beautiful but it's it's certainly a

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.360 
beautiful but it's it's certainly a
trifold<00:03:32.750> is<00:03:32.930> definitely<00:03:33.530> trifold<00:03:33.950> so<00:03:34.190> this

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
trifold is definitely trifold so this

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.630 
trifold is definitely trifold so this
opens<00:03:34.760> up<00:03:34.850> it's<00:03:35.120> also<00:03:35.270> magnetic<00:03:36.340> like<00:03:37.340> this

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
opens up it's also magnetic like this

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:45.250 
opens up it's also magnetic like this
and<00:03:38.480> like<00:03:38.630> this<00:03:38.660> I<00:03:42.670> was<00:03:43.670> so<00:03:43.970> inspired<00:03:44.450> with

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
and like this I was so inspired with

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.380 
and like this I was so inspired with
these<00:03:45.440> papers<00:03:45.890> I<00:03:46.190> just<00:03:46.520> could<00:03:46.700> not<00:03:46.850> stop<00:03:47.120> last

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
these papers I just could not stop last

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.570 
these papers I just could not stop last
night<00:03:47.660> I<00:03:47.870> did<00:03:48.709> a<00:03:48.739> little<00:03:48.920> stamping<00:03:49.459> on<00:03:49.550> the

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
night I did a little stamping on the

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.960 
night I did a little stamping on the
back<00:03:49.670> with<00:03:50.330> Tim<00:03:51.290> Holtz<00:03:51.650> seedless<00:03:52.310> preserved

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
back with Tim Holtz seedless preserved

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.530 
back with Tim Holtz seedless preserved
distress<00:03:53.660> ink<00:03:53.959> and<00:03:54.610> then<00:03:55.610> on<00:03:55.850> the<00:03:55.970> inside<00:03:56.150> here

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
distress ink and then on the inside here

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.290 
distress ink and then on the inside here
I'll<00:03:59.540> do<00:03:59.780> it<00:03:59.840> at<00:04:00.050> the<00:04:00.200> bottom<00:04:00.410> here<00:04:00.800> so<00:04:01.300> here's

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
I'll do it at the bottom here so here's

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.350 
I'll do it at the bottom here so here's
a<00:04:02.360> pocket<00:04:02.870> with<00:04:03.350> three<00:04:03.950> journaling<00:04:04.610> tags<00:04:04.850> and

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
a pocket with three journaling tags and

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.180 
a pocket with three journaling tags and
you<00:04:05.959> could<00:04:06.110> use<00:04:06.260> most<00:04:06.470> photo<00:04:06.709> mats<00:04:06.950> for

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
you could use most photo mats for

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:13.280 
you could use most photo mats for
smaller<00:04:07.580> photos<00:04:08.510> also<00:04:08.959> so<00:04:09.380> here's<00:04:09.709> three<00:04:10.100> tags

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.080 

and<00:04:13.739> then<00:04:14.580> on<00:04:15.209> this<00:04:15.659> side<00:04:16.070> or<00:04:17.070> up<00:04:17.430> here<00:04:17.850> I

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
and then on this side or up here I

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:25.810 
and then on this side or up here I
should<00:04:18.389> say<00:04:18.859> is<00:04:19.859> a<00:04:20.370> little<00:04:20.900> gusseted<00:04:21.900> pouch

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.750 

that's<00:04:27.440> you<00:04:28.440> know<00:04:28.560> I<00:04:28.740> made<00:04:29.040> it<00:04:29.070> so<00:04:29.370> that<00:04:29.400> it'll

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
that's you know I made it so that it'll

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:36.830 
that's you know I made it so that it'll
open<00:04:30.090> up<00:04:30.360> wide<00:04:33.350> and<00:04:34.350> it<00:04:34.500> has<00:04:34.710> just<00:04:35.840> envelope

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
open up wide and it has just envelope

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.300 
open up wide and it has just envelope
closure<00:04:37.550> with<00:04:38.550> a<00:04:38.580> little<00:04:38.910> bead<00:04:39.030> on<00:04:39.270> it<00:04:39.300> and<00:04:40.310> now

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
closure with a little bead on it and now

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.279 
closure with a little bead on it and now
for<00:04:41.580> the<00:04:41.669> inside<00:04:44.479> this<00:04:45.479> right<00:04:45.720> here<00:04:46.020> is<00:04:46.229> a

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289 
for the inside this right here is a

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:48.590 
for the inside this right here is a
business<00:04:46.710> card<00:04:47.130> box<00:04:47.340> and<00:04:47.820> that<00:04:48.060> just<00:04:48.360> flips

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
business card box and that just flips

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.790 
business card box and that just flips
open<00:04:49.490> and<00:04:50.490> you<00:04:50.910> could<00:04:51.030> shove<00:04:51.570> business<00:04:52.380> cards

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
know any type of memorabilia I thought

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.420 
know any type of memorabilia I thought
this<00:04:57.840> would<00:04:58.050> be<00:04:58.199> actually<00:04:58.410> a<00:04:58.710> pretty<00:04:59.100> good

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
this would be actually a pretty good

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.070 
this would be actually a pretty good
traveling<00:05:01.430> album<00:05:02.430> just<00:05:02.789> because<00:05:03.090> there's<00:05:03.720> a

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
traveling album just because there's a

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.810 
traveling album just because there's a
lot<00:05:04.320> of<00:05:04.470> different<00:05:04.949> things<00:05:05.190> that<00:05:05.310> you<00:05:05.550> can<00:05:05.699> do

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
lot of different things that you can do

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.909 
lot of different things that you can do
with<00:05:05.940> it<00:05:06.090> so<00:05:06.360> you<00:05:07.110> might<00:05:07.260> be<00:05:07.289> wondering<00:05:07.620> what

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
with it so you might be wondering what

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.120 
with it so you might be wondering what
this<00:05:08.070> is<00:05:08.280> if<00:05:08.460> you<00:05:08.550> haven't<00:05:08.910> seen<00:05:09.090> it<00:05:09.120> already
