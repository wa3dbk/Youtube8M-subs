00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
opponents this is the primary mode and

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.370

it's<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.910> one<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.150> plays<00:01:57.360> most<00:01:57.690> like<00:01:57.900> a<00:01:57.930> MOBA

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
it's the one that plays most like a MOBA

it's the one that plays most like a MOBA
the<00:01:58.890> mechanics<00:01:59.400> are<00:01:59.520> similar<00:01:59.850> but<00:02:00.300> the<00:02:00.420> action

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
the mechanics are similar but the action

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.330 
the mechanics are similar but the action
will<00:02:00.930> definitely<00:02:01.320> be<00:02:01.440> different<00:02:01.590> seeing<00:02:02.250> as

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
will definitely be different seeing as

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.700

around realtime strategy mechanics so

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.809 
around realtime strategy mechanics so
this<00:02:07.140> will<00:02:07.260> be<00:02:07.350> much<00:02:07.620> faster<00:02:07.650> paced<00:02:08.310> like<00:02:08.789> a

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
this will be much faster paced like a

gear<00:02:50.600> boxes<00:02:51.020> intention<00:02:51.560> is<00:02:51.710> to<00:02:51.890> make<00:02:52.100> this

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
gear boxes intention is to make this

gear boxes intention is to make this
game<00:02:52.720> significantly<00:02:53.720> different<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:55.220> next

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
game significantly different the next

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.340 
game significantly different the next
mode<00:02:55.670> is<00:02:55.850> devastation<00:02:56.510> which<00:02:57.140> is<00:02:57.260> an

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
mode is devastation which is an

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.680

hopefully<00:02:59.930> these<00:03:00.290> objectives<00:03:00.890> are<00:03:00.980> a<00:03:01.010> little

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
hopefully these objectives are a little

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.950 
hopefully these objectives are a little
more<00:03:01.400> complex<00:03:01.910> than<00:03:02.060> domination<00:03:02.690> style

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
more complex than domination style

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
similar to games like dirty bomb where

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.500 
similar to games like dirty bomb where
it<00:03:06.590> involves<00:03:06.860> demolition<00:03:07.430> or<00:03:07.730> me<00:03:08.030> a<00:03:08.060> carried

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
meltdown which is where teams will

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.410 
meltdown which is where teams will
protect<00:03:16.310> their<00:03:16.460> minions<00:03:16.790> as<00:03:16.940> they<00:03:17.150> march
