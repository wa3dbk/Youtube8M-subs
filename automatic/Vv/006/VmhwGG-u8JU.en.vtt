of<00:01:18.219> hard<00:01:18.429> you<00:01:18.490> know<00:01:18.640> with<00:01:18.759> the<00:01:18.880> traveling<00:01:19.390> but

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
of hard you know with the traveling but

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.359 
of hard you know with the traveling but
I<00:01:19.990> think<00:01:20.499> it's<00:01:20.590> just<00:01:20.679> a<00:01:20.799> little<00:01:20.890> extra<00:01:21.280> hard

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
I think it's just a little extra hard

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:22.739 
I think it's just a little extra hard
for<00:01:21.520> me<00:01:21.759> right<00:01:21.789> now<00:01:21.969> cuz<00:01:22.299> I<00:01:22.359> haven't<00:01:22.630> been

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
doing it all year but I guess easier you

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.419
