playing hot wire and driving around

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:11.660 
playing hot wire and driving around
right<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.619> then<00:01:10.770> we<00:01:10.920> looked<00:01:11.100> after<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.490> game

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
right and then we looked after the game

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.980 
right and then we looked after the game
realized<00:01:12.149> that<00:01:12.509> he<00:01:12.869> was<00:01:13.080> getting<00:01:14.180> 677<00:01:15.180> cash

realized that he was getting 677 cash
per<00:01:16.289> minute<00:01:16.649> which<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.399> pretty<00:01:17.850> ridiculous

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
per minute which is pretty ridiculous

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.260 
per minute which is pretty ridiculous
thinking<00:01:19.140> about<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.740> this<00:01:20.550> is<00:01:20.759> why<00:01:20.910> I<00:01:20.940> made

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
thinking about it and this is why I made

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.850 
thinking about it and this is why I made
this<00:01:21.390> video<00:01:21.750> saying<00:01:22.440> how<00:01:22.800> to<00:01:22.860> make<00:01:23.160> cash<00:01:23.460> fast

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
the best way to make money is to have

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.590 
the best way to make money is to have
three<00:01:27.960> men<00:01:28.289> that<00:01:28.860> run<00:01:29.100> around<00:01:29.220> inside<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:30.090> van

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
three men that run around inside a van

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.690 
three men that run around inside a van
or<00:01:30.630> car<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:32.060> Hotwire<00:01:33.060> mode<00:01:34.250> two<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.399> them<00:01:35.460> have

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
or car and Hotwire mode two of them have

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.440 
or car and Hotwire mode two of them have
to<00:01:35.910> have<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.600> m23<00:01:37.440> ohe<00:01:37.950> or<00:01:38.429> and<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.090> repair

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
to have the m23 ohe or and the repair

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.880 
to have the m23 ohe or and the repair
tool<00:01:40.640> the<00:01:41.640> key<00:01:41.880> stages<00:01:42.420> though<00:01:42.690> one<00:01:43.410> of<00:01:43.590> them

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
tool the key stages though one of them

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.780 
tool the key stages though one of them
is<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.280> repair<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:44.880> one<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.150> them<00:01:45.299> is<00:01:45.330> the

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
is the repair and one of them is the

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.859 
is the repair and one of them is the
grenade<00:01:47.790> launcher<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.479> takes<00:01:48.630> out<00:01:48.840> the

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
grenade launcher so it takes out the

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.859 
grenade launcher so it takes out the
other<00:01:48.990> cars<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:50.130> with<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.880> perks<00:01:51.150> I<00:01:51.540> think

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
other cars so with the perks I think

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.130 
other cars so with the perks I think
it's<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.140> second<00:01:52.850> second<00:01:53.850> lot<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.150> perks<00:01:54.360> one

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
it's the second second lot of perks one

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.130 
it's the second second lot of perks one
picks<00:01:55.470> more<00:01:55.860> grenade<00:01:56.549> shells<00:01:56.850> one<00:01:57.180> picks<00:01:57.780> more

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
picks more grenade shells one picks more

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.980 
picks more grenade shells one picks more
faster<00:01:58.920> appears<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.549> that<00:02:00.450> works<00:02:00.630> out<00:02:00.840> better

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
faster appears and that works out better

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.780 
faster appears and that works out better
and<00:02:01.520> then<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.970> driver<00:02:03.270> of<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.630> car<00:02:03.840> picks

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
and then the driver of the car picks

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.940 
and then the driver of the car picks
picks<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:06.119> stunt<00:02:06.810> driver<00:02:07.110> perk<00:02:07.409> which<00:02:07.710> is

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
picks the stunt driver perk which is

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.569 
picks the stunt driver perk which is
quite<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.600> chunk<00:02:09.600> which<00:02:09.959> is<00:02:10.170> basically<00:02:11.070> 40

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:11.579 
quite a chunk which is basically 40

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:14.569 
quite a chunk which is basically 40
grand<00:02:11.880> so<00:02:12.750> it<00:02:13.470> works<00:02:13.739> out<00:02:13.950> well<00:02:14.190> because<00:02:14.370> he

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:14.579 
grand so it works out well because he

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:17.930 
grand so it works out well because he
gets<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.940> nitrous<00:02:15.420> booth<00:02:16.370> so<00:02:17.370> this<00:02:17.610> how<00:02:17.760> this

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
gets the nitrous booth so this how this

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.720 
gets the nitrous booth so this how this
works<00:02:18.180> is<00:02:18.540> when<00:02:18.870> your<00:02:19.079> hot<00:02:19.650> load<00:02:19.860> so<00:02:20.310> you're

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
works is when your hot load so you're

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.210 
works is when your hot load so you're
traveling<00:02:21.540> at<00:02:21.630> that<00:02:21.780> constant<00:02:22.380> fast<00:02:22.769> speed

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
traveling at that constant fast speed

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.750 
traveling at that constant fast speed
being<00:02:23.940> captured<00:02:24.180> capturing<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.260> flag<00:02:25.760> you

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
being captured capturing the flag you

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.170 
being captured capturing the flag you
get<00:02:26.970> about<00:02:27.239> I<00:02:27.510> don't<00:02:27.660> know<00:02:28.019> 20<00:02:28.980> or<00:02:29.310> 15<00:02:29.700> points

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
get about I don't know 20 or 15 points

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.850 
get about I don't know 20 or 15 points
every<00:02:30.480> second<00:02:30.840> or<00:02:30.930> so<00:02:31.250> so<00:02:32.250> then<00:02:33.150> that<00:02:33.390> that

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
every second or so so then that that

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.759 
every second or so so then that that
translates<00:02:34.860> into<00:02:35.070> crash<00:02:35.700> very<00:02:36.150> fast<00:02:36.540> and<00:02:36.900> then

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
translates into crash very fast and then

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.060 
translates into crash very fast and then
if<00:02:38.220> you're<00:02:38.579> the<00:02:39.450> grenade<00:02:40.049> launcher<00:02:40.470> guy<00:02:40.680> or

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
if you're the grenade launcher guy or

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.759 
if you're the grenade launcher guy or
the<00:02:41.579> repair<00:02:41.970> here<00:02:42.390> if<00:02:42.720> you're<00:02:42.930> repairing<00:02:43.290> a

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
the repair here if you're repairing a

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.640 
the repair here if you're repairing a
lot<00:02:44.160> you're<00:02:44.850> getting<00:02:45.269> the<00:02:45.420> money<00:02:45.600> well<00:02:46.230> points

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
lot you're getting the money well points

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.250 
lot you're getting the money well points
from<00:02:46.799> that<00:02:47.040> which<00:02:47.280> then<00:02:47.790> turns<00:02:48.060> into<00:02:48.269> money<00:02:48.570> so

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
from that which then turns into money so

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.830 
from that which then turns into money so
then<00:02:49.440> it's<00:02:49.620> just<00:02:49.799> sort<00:02:50.160> of<00:02:50.250> very<00:02:51.239> fast<00:02:51.570> process

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
then it's just sort of very fast process

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.270 
then it's just sort of very fast process
if<00:02:52.350> you're

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
if you're

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.940 
if you're
traveling<00:02:53.790> around<00:02:54.060> a<00:02:54.270> lot<00:02:54.420> and<00:02:54.950> mostly

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
traveling around a lot and mostly

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.100 
traveling around a lot and mostly
getting<00:02:56.340> hammered<00:02:56.550> or<00:02:56.940> not<00:02:57.660> giving<00:02:57.959> hammered

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
getting hammered or not giving hammered

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.440 
getting hammered or not giving hammered
what<00:02:59.100> you're<00:02:59.220> chasing<00:02:59.580> others<00:02:59.819> so<00:03:00.180> it<00:03:00.270> works

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
what you're chasing others so it works

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.440 
what you're chasing others so it works
out<00:03:00.600> very<00:03:00.660> good<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:02.010> long<00:03:02.280> term<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:03.270> make

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
out very good and the long term to make

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.000 
out very good and the long term to make
money<00:03:04.050> fast<00:03:04.350> and<00:03:04.910> this<00:03:05.910> is<00:03:06.120> why<00:03:06.870> I<00:03:07.319> made<00:03:07.920> this
