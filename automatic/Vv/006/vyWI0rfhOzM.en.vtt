phantom beast which is quite

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.530 
phantom beast which is quite
it's<00:02:12.400> a<00:02:12.490> shame<00:02:12.670> that<00:02:12.730> it<00:02:12.970> doesn't<00:02:13.270> protect

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
it's a shame that it doesn't protect

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.390 
it's a shame that it doesn't protect
itself<00:02:13.990> but<00:02:14.380> I<00:02:14.440> think<00:02:14.770> I'll<00:02:14.920> be<00:02:15.070> a<00:02:15.100> little<00:02:15.220> bit

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
itself but I think I'll be a little bit

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.730 
itself but I think I'll be a little bit
too<00:02:15.520> busted<00:02:15.880> if<00:02:16.030> it<00:02:16.210> did<00:02:16.570> protect<00:02:16.870> itself<00:02:17.380> but

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
too busted if it did protect itself but

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.110 
too busted if it did protect itself but
I<00:02:17.770> think<00:02:18.010> mecha<00:02:18.190> phantom<00:02:18.400> piece<00:02:18.730> do<00:02:18.940> need

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
I think mecha phantom piece do need

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.280 
I think mecha phantom piece do need
something<00:02:19.450> a<00:02:19.510> little<00:02:19.540> bit<00:02:19.840> game-breaking

something a little bit game-breaking

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.350

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
that if Jurgis I gets reprinted then

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.090

but I think this is quite a nice boss
monster<00:02:56.320> for<00:02:56.500> them<00:02:56.620> and<00:02:57.070> it<00:02:57.340> has<00:02:57.459> pretty<00:02:57.640> cool

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820
