00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.830
 a British marine archaeologist an ex 

00:00:03.239 --> 00:00:07.290
 American pilot and the firm 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.300
 Australian of resonance claim to have 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.250
 found each on their side the 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.100
 remains of the Malaysian airline's plane 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.770
 which disappeared on March 8 with 239 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.060
 people on board meanwhile today 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.249
 unveiled the first report 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.740
 draft of the Malaysian government on the 

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:23.910
 tragedy according to which they passed 17 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.160
 minutes after the last 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.349
 conversation between the controllers 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.820
 flights from Kuala Lumpur Airport and 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.169
 the pilots of the ship to be 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.660
 they would realize that they had lost 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:36.660
 contact with the flight and to top 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.060
 it took four hours before ordering 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.280
 the search of the plane with details 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.330
 taken from satellite photos 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.430
 used in the search 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.620
 the English marine researcher tim baker 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.020
 locate remains of the ship near the 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.490
 coasts of vietnam about 3,000 miles from 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.580
 the area where teams from various countries 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:55.140
 they have been trying to find the law 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.970
 which says that the color of a huge 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.500
 sheet metal found in the area 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.570
 corresponds to the colors of the tail 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.600
 of the boeing that covered the kuala route 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.519
 lumpur to Beijing the hacker hypothesis 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.480
 agrees with the former's new pilot 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.820
 york 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.710
 robot who also relies on images 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.080
 satellites broadcast on the internet 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.180
 however the Australian company of 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.090
 resonance places your point of interest in 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.260
 Bay of Bengal 118 miles south 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.260
 of bangladesh 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.860
 and a spokesperson for the association 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.940
 Hispanic professional pilots is a 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.350
 nice to say welcome again 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.720
 thank you 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.460
 what do you think about this now it turns out that 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.100
 all sides saying find remains 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.900
 of the plane that's right what 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.270
 it is happening here that this archaeologist 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.730
 marino team ey care was watching him 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.400
 some images of satellites published 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.950
 for the nasa and he ensures that that 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.930
 fragment found near the coast 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.080
 of vietnam belonged to this plane the 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.640
 plane from the malaysian line we have to 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.500
 remember that there were tsunamis in that 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.040
 area there are many marine rubbish in 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.020
 that area 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.220
 and it's very difficult until you have 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.650
 concrete evidence to be able to 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.900
 corroborate this type of information by 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:08.380
 another side there is another company that they 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:11.560
 dedicated to using a technology that is 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.390
 as a geographical resonance system 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.000
 that they used was from the old 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.740
 Soviet Union this was used in the 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.620
 militia and the Soviet Union what 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:25.210
 used to track bunkers and uranium 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:27.850
 and warlike material metals like 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.790
 in addition to massive destruction when it 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.560
 demilitarize this system happens to be 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.720
 a group of scientists these groups 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.320
 scientists were responsible for using 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:42.580
 this system in order to search 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.740
 platinum gold metals and obviously they 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.120
 they also say that they detected a 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.760
 area that has some clarification 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.620
 decision but the legitimate one if possible 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.480
 Well in that area 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.300
 obviously the marine currents 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.130
 they could drag a piece of metal 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.820
 to another continent tell me what 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:03.040
 you think of the 17 minutes that I do not know 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.530
 they realized that it was not on the radar 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.350
 and of the four hours that theoretically 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.250
 it took them to start an operation 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.060
 search and good here there was a demand 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.490
 first of all what happens is that 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.230
 we are talking about other countries if what 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.760
 we compare with us here in states 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.150
 and we do not have much more standards 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.820
 high and a plane does not arrive within the 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.440
 next ten minutes it is supposed to be 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.090
 report a control and then call in 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.900
 a border is not reported because it is already 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.569
 start doing a search 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.160
 either through communicating with the 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.960
 system 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.890
 to control the air traffic of 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:42.260
 different countries and if there is no contact 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.930
 of the plane then then unfolds 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.850
 an aerial search by sea 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.470
 and everything else but then these people 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.140
 it took four hours 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.670
 another thing is that for example the 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.530
 Airlines here in the USA have a 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.000
 flight system now that what you 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.220
 they call that they can see their flight 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.240
 within the facility of the airline 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.220
 what is called the flight for the 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.260
 dispatcher who dispatches the flight he 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.940
 you can see everything obviously also the 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.130
 Various traffic controller can 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.300
 see it too if he is doing the 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.770
 Same job controlled but 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.270
 internally basora lewin is like a 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.860
 quality control and so that it remains 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.750
 clear an airplane of this type in four 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.799
 hours it runs that about two thousand 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:20.150
 miles approximately like a few thousand 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.150
 500 miles may be that the 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:25.430
 difference is bad non- mental in terms 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.130
 de la de vÃ©lez is briefly that you 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:31.160
 he says his knowledge plus his instinct 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.290
 in terms of going to happen months before 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.960
 learned that appears something can 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.700
 pass that never or for what you know 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.790
 we would be closer good I am 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.340
 optimist and I think that 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.960
 if you are going to find it is a matter of the 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.730
 time it is difficult to specify the flight 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.920
 of air france both two years in 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.110
 get the box here they are 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:53.590
 using more resources until the day of 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.510
 Today has been more than 50 million 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.730
 investment when the flight of air france 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.860
 when the boxes were found two years 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.510
 that's what they spent 50 million a 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.260
 I like to have it with us to be like that love 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.260
 but very kind
