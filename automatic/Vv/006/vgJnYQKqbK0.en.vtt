00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
can probably just about tell where he

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.860 
can probably just about tell where he
could<00:02:55.440> rather<00:02:55.590> be<00:02:55.800> fine<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.540> unevenly<00:02:57.540> ground

could rather be fine and unevenly ground
but<00:02:58.290> never<00:02:58.590> mind<00:02:58.769> about<00:02:58.860> that<00:02:59.040> and<00:02:59.910> I<00:03:00.780> sliced

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
but never mind about that and I sliced

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.020 
but never mind about that and I sliced
up<00:03:01.709> entrails<00:03:02.010> yesterday's<00:03:02.519> purpose<00:03:02.820> on<00:03:02.940> my

up entrails yesterday's purpose on my
lap<00:03:03.180> pulled<00:03:03.450> it<00:03:03.540> up<00:03:03.630> and<00:03:03.930> then<00:03:04.080> rip<00:03:04.350> all<00:03:05.040> of<00:03:05.250> a

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
lap pulled it up and then rip all of a

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
slice even it really does bite in so

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.830 
slice even it really does bite in so
that<00:03:08.489> may<00:03:08.910> cause<00:03:09.180> some<00:03:09.209> issues<00:03:09.570> in<00:03:09.600> the<00:03:09.720> future

that may cause some issues in the future

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.180 
that may cause some issues in the future
if<00:03:10.080> you<00:03:10.140> ever<00:03:10.200> get<00:03:10.470> your<00:03:10.560> finger<00:03:10.830> well<00:03:11.040> in

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
if you ever get your finger well in

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
there and for some reason brought it

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.410 
there and for some reason brought it
back<00:03:13.200> you<00:03:13.440> will<00:03:13.620> draw<00:03:13.830> blood<00:03:14.180> it's<00:03:15.180> catching

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
back you will draw blood it's catching

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.740 
back you will draw blood it's catching
you<00:03:15.660> can<00:03:15.780> mock<00:03:15.900> up<00:03:16.049> to<00:03:16.170> hear<00:03:16.290> this<00:03:16.380> you<00:03:17.750> can

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
you can mock up to hear this you can

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.759 
you can mock up to hear this you can
even<00:03:18.900> see<00:03:19.140> my<00:03:19.170> finger<00:03:19.920> metier<00:03:20.190> my<00:03:20.430> skin<00:03:21.060> being

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
even see my finger metier my skin being

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.140 
even see my finger metier my skin being
sliced<00:03:22.769> up<00:03:22.950> cut<00:03:23.160> up<00:03:23.190> just<00:03:23.610> breaking<00:03:23.850> the<00:03:24.000> skin

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
sliced up cut up just breaking the skin

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.039 
sliced up cut up just breaking the skin
so<00:03:24.299> it's<00:03:24.420> not<00:03:24.480> too<00:03:24.660> bad

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
so it's not too bad

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.930 
so it's not too bad

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.440 
below the handle scales it doesn't
protrude<00:03:40.170> enough<00:03:40.440> it's<00:03:40.620> not<00:03:40.709> quickly<00:03:41.070> enough

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
protrude enough it's not quickly enough

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.110

that that bloody canes just tears where

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.199 
that that bloody canes just tears where
the<00:04:10.560> skin<00:04:10.769> she<00:04:11.489> you've<00:04:11.579> got<00:04:11.700> to<00:04:11.790> find<00:04:11.940> a<00:04:12.030> sweet

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
the skin she you've got to find a sweet

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:13.819 
the skin she you've got to find a sweet
spot<00:04:12.269> and<00:04:12.570> when<00:04:12.660> you<00:04:12.720> do<00:04:12.870> of<00:04:12.959> course<00:04:13.019> it<00:04:13.320> flies

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
spot and when you do of course it flies

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:17.150 
spot and when you do of course it flies
out<00:04:14.040> but<00:04:14.640> it's<00:04:14.760> not<00:04:14.880> reliable<00:04:15.799> what<00:04:16.799> I<00:04:16.829> do<00:04:16.919> like

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
out but it's not reliable what I do like

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.529 
out but it's not reliable what I do like
however<00:04:17.400> is<00:04:17.579> a<00:04:17.640> fact<00:04:17.820> that<00:04:17.940> for<00:04:18.060> lefties<00:04:18.390> it's

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
however is a fact that for lefties it's

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:19.759 
however is a fact that for lefties it's
very<00:04:18.690> lefty<00:04:18.959> friendly<00:04:19.229> you<00:04:19.289> can<00:04:19.320> see<00:04:19.560> it's<00:04:19.709> the

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
very lefty friendly you can see it's the

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:20.930 
very lefty friendly you can see it's the
same<00:04:19.950> distance<00:04:20.250> from<00:04:20.400> each<00:04:20.519> hand<00:04:20.640> low<00:04:20.789> scale

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
same distance from each hand low scale

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.490 
same distance from each hand low scale
so<00:04:21.120> it's<00:04:21.239> just<00:04:21.419> as<00:04:21.599> difficult<00:04:21.720> for<00:04:21.959> lefties<00:04:22.380> as

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
so it's just as difficult for lefties as

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.470 
so it's just as difficult for lefties as
its<00:04:22.650> varieties

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
its varieties

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.060 
its varieties
joking<00:04:24.410> of<00:04:24.440> course<00:04:24.500> and<00:04:26.860> trouble<00:04:27.860> is<00:04:27.950> it's

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
joking of course and trouble is it's

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.160 
joking of course and trouble is it's
only<00:04:28.190> for<00:04:28.370> a<00:04:28.400> write<00:04:28.580> up<00:04:28.790> tip<00:04:29.030> right<00:04:29.780> hand<00:04:29.960> tip

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.170 
only for a write up tip right hand tip

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.710 
only for a write up tip right hand tip
I'll<00:04:30.290> carry<00:04:30.970> so<00:04:31.970> another<00:04:32.180> combination<00:04:32.450> for

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
I'll carry so another combination for

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.050 
I'll carry so another combination for
lefties<00:04:33.020> are<00:04:33.230> the<00:04:33.350> tip<00:04:33.500> up<00:04:33.650> or<00:04:33.800> tip<00:04:33.980> down<00:04:34.130> so

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
lefties are the tip up or tip down so

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.440 
lefties are the tip up or tip down so
just<00:04:35.300> tip<00:04:35.630> up<00:04:35.810> which<00:04:36.320> is<00:04:36.470> which<00:04:36.860> kind<00:04:37.040> of

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
just tip up which is which kind of

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
negates in the way the issue of the

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.530 
negates in the way the issue of the
point<00:04:41.710> tearing<00:04:42.710> into<00:04:42.860> you<00:04:43.070> but<00:04:43.850> on<00:04:43.940> drawing<00:04:44.420> of

very<00:05:18.050> badly<00:05:18.380> polished<00:05:18.830> of<00:05:18.920> this<00:05:19.070> g10<00:05:19.400> and<00:05:19.580> it

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640 
very badly polished of this g10 and it

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.920 
very badly polished of this g10 and it

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.010 
been my Carter or aluminium perhaps it

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:29.080 
been my Carter or aluminium perhaps it
would<00:05:28.100> have<00:05:28.160> been<00:05:28.220> quite<00:05:28.520> a<00:05:28.550> nice<00:05:28.670> touch<00:05:28.880> to<00:05:29.060> it

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
would have been quite a nice touch to it

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:30.520 
would have been quite a nice touch to it
but<00:05:29.330> it's<00:05:29.450> just<00:05:29.600> in<00:05:29.780> the<00:05:29.840> moment<00:05:29.990> it<00:05:30.230> looks<00:05:30.440> a

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
but it's just in the moment it looks a

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.590
