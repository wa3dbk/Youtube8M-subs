00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.809
 I think the network is the environment 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.060
 that we do more and more things that 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.860
 we have displaced more and more parts of 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.930
 our life and we inform ourselves 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.529
 we express then to position ourselves in 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.810
 the fundamental networks is a site that 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.369
 if you think about it, it is subject to many 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.869
 misinterpretations people think 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.489
 that the substitute review when the 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.680
 network is actually a complementary of 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.020
 what we do outside the network does not have 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.910
 I sense having a certain idea of 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.860
 personal strategy strategy 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.110
 corporate center of positions of the 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.170
 network while the future of 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.989
 social networks I think it's in 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:51.880
 serve as a complement for what a 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.950
 person does in your life 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.430
 a site where you can from 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:59.260
 test ideas and drop things in the middle 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.700
 mature to see how they are completed or 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.970
 how they turn out to you if they are stupid 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.590
 absolute until a little whatever you want not 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.690
 share things that you appreciate sharing 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.220
 etcetera in a place where we 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.720
 we sit more and more comfortable 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.970
 I believe that in the future what is going to 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.180
 influence are people or companies or 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.090
 figures that project passion for what 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.370
 do I think we are going towards a very future 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.710
 very dystopian very curious very possible 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.180
 trial which is a good part of 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:31.040
 unemployment that we know of will convert it 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:32.840
 in structural and many people let's say the 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.340
 abundance of labor and therefore 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.960
 who will have work those 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.060
 those who work on something that 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.640
 love that you are passionate about what you want 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.990
 and the one who works to live they stay 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.920
 unemployed 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.390
 a very pleasant experience of 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.830
 I think it's sincerity or 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.050
 transparency in the sentence very sense 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.780
 comfortable 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.090
 and I found a place where 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.070
 I could project that comfort 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.270
 I believe that many of the narratives that 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.369
 we know 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.859
 will surely persist now behind 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.040
 other things surely there will be a 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:06.060
 descent 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.590
 persistent barriers to entry that 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.590
 make them be produced from another 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.930
 way they can be managed from another 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.930
 way or popularize it in another way but 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.890
 I think narrative as such 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.750
 some new ones will appear but in 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.360
 general will persist 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.920
 which do you think are the most 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.390
 important that we're going to live in how 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.390
 we are going to organize as a society 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.530
 If that
