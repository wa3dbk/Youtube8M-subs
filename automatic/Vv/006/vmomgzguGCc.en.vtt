got Air Corps I didn't get any of the
other<00:01:43.369> ones<00:01:43.670> so<00:01:43.970> let<00:01:44.929> me<00:01:45.050> first<00:01:45.080> open<00:01:45.740> it<00:01:45.830> up

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
other ones so let me first open it up

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.790 
other ones so let me first open it up
and<00:01:46.160> as<00:01:47.030> you<00:01:47.179> can<00:01:47.330> see<00:01:47.360> it<00:01:47.660> lights<00:01:47.929> up<00:01:48.170> just

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
and as you can see it lights up just

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.490 
and as you can see it lights up just
blinks<00:01:49.250> there's<00:01:49.940> no<00:01:50.179> sounds<00:01:50.720> or<00:01:50.810> anything<00:01:50.899> but

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
blinks there's no sounds or anything but

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.350 
blinks there's no sounds or anything but
all<00:01:51.679> it<00:01:51.770> does<00:01:51.979> and<00:01:52.360> this<00:01:53.360> part<00:01:53.690> is<00:01:53.840> no<00:01:54.170> longer

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
all it does and this part is no longer

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.940 
all it does and this part is no longer
something<00:01:56.360> that<00:01:56.660> just<00:01:56.840> pops<00:01:57.080> up<00:01:57.289> its<00:01:57.500> manual

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
something that just pops up its manual

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.559 
something that just pops up its manual
now<00:01:58.130> so<00:01:58.490> you<00:01:58.550> have<00:01:58.759> to<00:01:58.880> actually<00:01:59.030> pull<00:01:59.420> that

00:01:59.559 --> 00:01:59.569 
now so you have to actually pull that

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:05.620 
now so you have to actually pull that
part<00:01:59.840> up<00:02:01.420> this<00:02:02.420> has<00:02:03.009> 110<00:02:04.009> GS<00:02:04.369> so<00:02:05.179> obviously

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
part up this has 110 GS so obviously

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.410 
part up this has 110 GS so obviously
it's<00:02:05.840> more<00:02:06.050> powerful<00:02:06.259> than<00:02:06.950> the<00:02:07.550> normal<00:02:08.240> air

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
it's more powerful than the normal air

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.400 
it's more powerful than the normal air
course<00:02:08.780> and<00:02:09.789> the<00:02:10.789> DNA<00:02:11.060> code<00:02:11.480> did<00:02:11.780> not<00:02:11.990> give<00:02:12.260> me

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
course and the DNA code did not give me

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.140 
course and the DNA code did not give me
an<00:02:12.500> Air<00:02:12.620> Corps<00:02:12.950> it<00:02:13.040> just<00:02:13.220> gave<00:02:13.370> me<00:02:13.430> 300<00:02:13.790> block

Derek<00:02:48.950> it's<00:02:49.580> fine<00:02:49.940> do<00:02:50.630> you<00:02:50.720> know<00:02:50.810> why<00:02:50.990> it's<00:02:51.200> fun

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
Derek it's fine do you know why it's fun

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.320 
Derek it's fine do you know why it's fun
it's<00:02:51.680> because<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:52.100> tail<00:02:52.430> is<00:02:52.460> keeping<00:02:53.060> it<00:02:53.150> on

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
it's because the tail is keeping it on

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.360 
it's because the tail is keeping it on
not<00:02:54.170> because<00:02:54.560> it's<00:02:54.740> staying<00:02:55.070> on<00:02:55.480> so<00:02:56.860> if<00:02:57.860> he

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
not because it's staying on so if he

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.190 
not because it's staying on so if he
didn't<00:02:58.640> have<00:02:58.730> his<00:02:58.880> tail<00:02:59.210> I'm<00:02:59.540> sure<00:02:59.900> this<00:03:00.080> is

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
didn't have his tail I'm sure this is

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.000 
didn't have his tail I'm sure this is
fall<00:03:00.470> off<00:03:00.590> just<00:03:00.920> as<00:03:01.070> easily<00:03:02.050> so<00:03:03.050> that's<00:03:03.650> one

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
fall off just as easily so that's one

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.190 
fall off just as easily so that's one
thing<00:03:04.160> I'm<00:03:04.310> really<00:03:04.640> not<00:03:04.880> impressed<00:03:05.090> by<00:03:05.600> the

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
thing I'm really not impressed by the

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.560 
thing I'm really not impressed by the
other<00:03:06.410> thing<00:03:06.770> is<00:03:06.980> some<00:03:07.850> of<00:03:07.940> these<00:03:08.030> and<00:03:08.420> this

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
other thing is some of these and this

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.620 
other thing is some of these and this
one<00:03:08.780> looks<00:03:08.900> ok<00:03:09.380> but<00:03:09.680> like<00:03:10.370> battle<00:03:11.030> turbine<00:03:11.420> for

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
one looks ok but like battle turbine for

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.920 
one looks ok but like battle turbine for
example<00:03:12.050> it<00:03:12.860> just<00:03:13.100> has<00:03:13.220> the<00:03:13.370> claws<00:03:13.720> at<00:03:14.720> the

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
example it just has the claws at the

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.570 
example it just has the claws at the
bottom<00:03:15.290> and<00:03:15.500> then<00:03:15.710> it<00:03:15.950> looks<00:03:16.100> kind<00:03:16.490> of<00:03:16.520> like

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
bottom and then it looks kind of like

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.990 
bottom and then it looks kind of like
that<00:03:16.850> it<00:03:17.270> doesn't<00:03:17.330> have<00:03:17.810> like<00:03:18.290> these<00:03:18.470> two

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
that it doesn't have like these two

that it doesn't have like these two
little<00:03:20.000> barrel<00:03:20.690> things<00:03:20.930> just<00:03:21.410> one<00:03:21.950> on<00:03:22.070> each

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
little barrel things just one on each

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.110 
little barrel things just one on each
side<00:03:22.250> so<00:03:22.880> it<00:03:23.120> looks<00:03:23.300> kind<00:03:23.600> of<00:03:23.660> awkward<00:03:24.170> and

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
side so it looks kind of awkward and

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.660 
side so it looks kind of awkward and
like<00:03:26.120> twin<00:03:26.450> destruct<00:03:26.900> er<00:03:27.050> it<00:03:27.770> was<00:03:27.980> like<00:03:28.100> a<00:03:28.130> cube

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
like twin destruct er it was like a cube

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.030 
like twin destruct er it was like a cube
and<00:03:29.030> instead<00:03:29.780> of<00:03:29.870> seeing<00:03:30.170> like<00:03:30.350> the<00:03:30.470> long<00:03:30.680> gun

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
and instead of seeing like the long gun

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.500 
and instead of seeing like the long gun
barrels<00:03:31.459> it<00:03:31.670> kind<00:03:31.910> of<00:03:31.940> looked<00:03:32.090> like<00:03:32.150> just<00:03:32.330> like

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
barrels it kind of looked like just like

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.780 
barrels it kind of looked like just like
a<00:03:32.570> little<00:03:32.690> nubs<00:03:33.050> coming<00:03:33.530> out<00:03:33.650> of<00:03:33.680> it<00:03:33.920> I<00:03:34.100> just

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
a little nubs coming out of it I just

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.310 
a little nubs coming out of it I just
thought<00:03:34.910> they<00:03:35.060> looked<00:03:35.300> really<00:03:35.600> bad<00:03:35.870> and<00:03:36.170> I

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
thought they looked really bad and I

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.930 
thought they looked really bad and I

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
they looked really cool but then when I

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.620 
they looked really cool but then when I
actually<00:03:40.130> seeing<00:03:40.580> them<00:03:40.760> now<00:03:40.910> they<00:03:41.209> just<00:03:41.420> I

here but I don't know how many different

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:09.460 
here but I don't know how many different
attributes<00:04:07.940> everything<00:04:08.480> comes<00:04:08.750> in<00:04:08.900> but<00:04:09.140> I<00:04:09.170> saw

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
attributes everything comes in but I saw

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.440 
attributes everything comes in but I saw
that<00:04:09.680> twin<00:04:09.920> destructors<00:04:10.489> came<00:04:10.730> in<00:04:10.880> both<00:04:11.060> gold

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
that twin destructors came in both gold

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.780 
that twin destructors came in both gold
and<00:04:11.660> silver<00:04:12.170> so<00:04:12.500> more<00:04:13.070> than<00:04:13.100> likely<00:04:13.250> there's

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
and silver so more than likely there's

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.030 
and silver so more than likely there's
other<00:04:14.060> attributes<00:04:14.690> of<00:04:14.810> Air<00:04:14.989> Corps<00:04:15.260> as<00:04:15.410> well<00:04:15.620> so

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
other attributes of Air Corps as well so

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.070 
other attributes of Air Corps as well so
I'm<00:04:16.580> guessing<00:04:17.060> there's<00:04:17.419> all<00:04:17.720> three

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.080 
I'm guessing there's all three

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.259 
I'm guessing there's all three
attributes<00:04:18.260> out<00:04:18.769> there<00:04:19.070> and<00:04:19.310> that<00:04:19.970> would<00:04:20.090> mean

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
attributes out there and that would mean

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:21.909 
attributes out there and that would mean
you'd<00:04:20.480> have<00:04:20.510> to<00:04:20.720> buy<00:04:20.840> one<00:04:21.140> of<00:04:21.169> each<00:04:21.410> if<00:04:21.769> you

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
you'd have to buy one of each if you

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.640 
you'd have to buy one of each if you
were<00:04:22.040> going<00:04:22.190> to<00:04:22.220> collect<00:04:22.430> them<00:04:22.760> all<00:04:22.910> and<00:04:23.650> not

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
were going to collect them all and not

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.230 
were going to collect them all and not
only<00:04:24.740> that<00:04:24.830> they're<00:04:25.190> ten<00:04:25.430> dollars<00:04:25.730> each<00:04:25.940> for

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
only that they're ten dollars each for

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.330 
only that they're ten dollars each for
just<00:04:26.419> for<00:04:26.690> these<00:04:26.780> things<00:04:27.110> and<00:04:27.320> I<00:04:27.500> just<00:04:27.950> really

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
just for these things and I just really

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.100 
just for these things and I just really
don't<00:04:28.460> think<00:04:28.580> it's<00:04:28.790> worth<00:04:29.000> it<00:04:29.240> I<00:04:29.419> mean<00:04:29.870> it's

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
don't think it's worth it I mean it's

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.659 
don't think it's worth it I mean it's
kind<00:04:30.350> of<00:04:30.380> expensive<00:04:30.710> already<00:04:31.220> buying<00:04:31.490> the

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
kind of expensive already buying the

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:32.650 
kind of expensive already buying the
regular<00:04:32.000> battle<00:04:32.360> gear

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
regular battle gear

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.320 
regular battle gear
then<00:04:32.750> the<00:04:32.840> pay<00:04:32.990> ten<00:04:33.290> dollars<00:04:33.710> for<00:04:33.920> these<00:04:34.330> it's

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
then the pay ten dollars for these it's

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.390 
then the pay ten dollars for these it's
not<00:04:35.480> really<00:04:35.720> something<00:04:35.990> I<00:04:36.230> want<00:04:36.530> to<00:04:36.620> do<00:04:36.770> so<00:04:37.130> I

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
not really something I want to do so I

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.480 
not really something I want to do so I
mean<00:04:38.210> like<00:04:38.360> I<00:04:38.450> said<00:04:38.480> it's<00:04:39.280> blocking<00:04:40.280> on

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
mean like I said it's blocking on

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.610 
mean like I said it's blocking on
dimensions<00:04:40.970> it<00:04:41.120> does<00:04:41.270> nothing<00:04:41.510> for<00:04:41.990> you<00:04:42.170> the

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
dimensions it does nothing for you the

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.970 
dimensions it does nothing for you the
only<00:04:43.130> plus<00:04:43.490> to<00:04:43.790> these<00:04:43.940> is<00:04:44.270> that<00:04:44.900> this<00:04:45.080> is<00:04:45.260> 110<00:04:45.950> g

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 
only plus to these is that this is 110 g

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.060 
only plus to these is that this is 110 g
so<00:04:46.880> I'm<00:04:47.690> assuming<00:04:47.900> all<00:04:48.350> the<00:04:48.770> deluxe

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
so I'm assuming all the deluxe

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.400 
so I'm assuming all the deluxe
battlegear<00:04:49.520> have<00:04:49.790> high<00:04:50.000> G<00:04:50.300> power<00:04:50.480> as<00:04:50.840> opposed

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
battlegear have high G power as opposed

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.250 
battlegear have high G power as opposed
to<00:04:51.710> the<00:04:51.980> regular<00:04:52.760> ones<00:04:52.970> so<00:04:53.690> if<00:04:53.960> you<00:04:54.080> actually

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
to the regular ones so if you actually

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.290 
to the regular ones so if you actually
play<00:04:54.830> the<00:04:55.010> game<00:04:55.220> with<00:04:55.550> your<00:04:55.700> friends<00:04:56.150> then

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
play the game with your friends then

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.930 
play the game with your friends then
these<00:04:57.140> might<00:04:57.530> be<00:04:57.710> worthwhile<00:04:57.920> to<00:04:58.160> you<00:04:58.520> because

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
these might be worthwhile to you because

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.460 
these might be worthwhile to you because
they're<00:04:59.300> obviously<00:04:59.660> a<00:04:59.750> give<00:05:00.020> you<00:05:00.110> an<00:05:00.200> extra

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
they're obviously a give you an extra

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.310 
they're obviously a give you an extra
boost<00:05:00.740> in<00:05:01.040> battle<00:05:01.400> but<00:05:02.210> aside<00:05:02.600> from<00:05:02.660> that<00:05:02.870> I

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
boost in battle but aside from that I

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.440 
boost in battle but aside from that I
don't<00:05:04.070> like<00:05:04.310> them<00:05:04.490> at<00:05:04.550> all<00:05:04.670> and<00:05:05.030> I<00:05:05.210> don't

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
don't like them at all and I don't

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.210 
don't like them at all and I don't
really<00:05:05.660> recommend<00:05:05.960> them<00:05:06.290> so<00:05:06.590> I<00:05:06.800> mean<00:05:07.070> that's

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
really recommend them so I mean that's

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.000 
really recommend them so I mean that's
just<00:05:07.400> my<00:05:07.550> opinion<00:05:07.580> but<00:05:08.380> I<00:05:09.380> mean<00:05:09.770> you<00:05:09.860> guys

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
just my opinion but I mean you guys

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.030 
just my opinion but I mean you guys
might<00:05:10.550> like<00:05:10.580> them<00:05:10.970> I<00:05:11.270> just<00:05:11.800> don't<00:05:12.800> care<00:05:12.980> for

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
might like them I just don't care for

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.100 
might like them I just don't care for
them<00:05:13.280> at<00:05:13.370> all<00:05:13.490> i<00:05:13.520> think<00:05:13.760> it's<00:05:14.450> just<00:05:14.810> kind<00:05:15.050> of

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
them at all i think it's just kind of

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.650 
them at all i think it's just kind of
another<00:05:16.010> way<00:05:16.250> to<00:05:16.310> make<00:05:16.730> money<00:05:16.940> off<00:05:17.240> the<00:05:17.420> same

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
another way to make money off the same

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.120 
another way to make money off the same
battle<00:05:18.020> gear<00:05:18.170> pretty<00:05:18.470> much<00:05:18.590> that<00:05:19.010> have

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
battle gear pretty much that have

battle gear pretty much that have
already<00:05:19.280> been<00:05:19.430> released<00:05:19.990> instead<00:05:20.990> of<00:05:21.020> giving

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
already been released instead of giving

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.250 
already been released instead of giving

said um don't really recommend them but

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.650 
said um don't really recommend them but
it's<00:05:34.220> pretty<00:05:34.370> much<00:05:34.460> all<00:05:34.730> I<00:05:34.760> have<00:05:35.000> to<00:05:35.150> say<00:05:35.180> for

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:35.660 
it's pretty much all I have to say for

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.330 
it's pretty much all I have to say for
this<00:05:35.810> video<00:05:36.170> this<00:05:36.560> is<00:05:36.740> going<00:05:36.890> to<00:05:36.980> be<00:05:37.070> the<00:05:37.190> only

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
this video this is going to be the only

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.250 
this video this is going to be the only
video<00:05:37.700> on<00:05:38.000> deluxe<00:05:38.360> battle<00:05:38.660> gear<00:05:38.840> because<00:05:39.050> I

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
video on deluxe battle gear because I

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.500 
video on deluxe battle gear because I
don't<00:05:39.650> plan<00:05:39.890> on<00:05:39.950> buying<00:05:40.280> any<00:05:40.520> more<00:05:40.580> but<00:05:41.330> for

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
don't plan on buying any more but for

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:46.390 
don't plan on buying any more but for
some<00:05:41.750> odd<00:05:42.220> reason<00:05:43.220> they<00:05:44.210> become<00:05:44.930> amazing<00:05:45.920> or

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
some odd reason they become amazing or

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.240 
some odd reason they become amazing or
lower<00:05:47.390> priced<00:05:47.780> or<00:05:48.080> something<00:05:48.470> that<00:05:48.680> I<00:05:48.710> might

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
lower priced or something that I might

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.159 
lower priced or something that I might
consider<00:05:49.430> it<00:05:49.910> but<00:05:50.180> I<00:05:50.450> highly<00:05:50.840> doubt<00:05:51.080> that

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:53.169 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:55.240 

pretty<00:05:54.169> much<00:05:54.290> my<00:05:54.530> next<00:05:54.800> review<00:05:54.919> will

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
pretty much my next review will

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.040 
pretty much my next review will
hopefully<00:05:55.460> be<00:05:55.730> the<00:05:55.850> evil<00:05:55.970> twin<00:05:56.330> packs<00:05:56.570> but<00:05:56.900> if

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
hopefully be the evil twin packs but if

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.400 
hopefully be the evil twin packs but if
not<00:05:57.200> then<00:05:57.880> hopefully<00:05:58.880> wave<00:05:59.060> 3<00:05:59.390> so<00:05:59.690> I<00:05:59.930> guess

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:00.410 
not then hopefully wave 3 so I guess

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.050 
not then hopefully wave 3 so I guess
we'll<00:06:00.650> see<00:06:00.830> what<00:06:00.980> happens<00:06:01.070> thanks<00:06:01.970> for
