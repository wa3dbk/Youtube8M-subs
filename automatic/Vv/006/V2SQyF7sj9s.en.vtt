00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
gonna have issues I mean most likely

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.630 
gonna have issues I mean most likely
it's<00:01:37.439> not<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.680> heat<00:01:37.920> read<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.310> know<00:01:38.430> most

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
it's not a heat read you know most

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.539 
it's not a heat read you know most
likely<00:01:39.180> it's<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:40.079> it's<00:01:40.530> just<00:01:40.799> over<00:01:41.100> 18<00:01:41.369> when

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
likely it's a it's just over 18 when

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:42.889 
likely it's a it's just over 18 when
they<00:01:41.579> made<00:01:41.880> an<00:01:42.060> eye<00:01:42.150> when<00:01:42.299> they<00:01:42.450> ground<00:01:42.720> it

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
they made an eye when they ground it

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.139 
they made an eye when they ground it
they<00:01:43.409> probably<00:01:43.649> just<00:01:43.799> overheated<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.670> edge

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
they probably just overheated the edge

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.120 
they probably just overheated the edge
when<00:01:45.479> they<00:01:45.600> grounded<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.049> edge<00:01:46.229> on<00:01:46.439> it<00:01:46.500> so

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
when they grounded the edge on it so

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.330 
when they grounded the edge on it so
that<00:01:48.030> issue<00:01:48.990> will<00:01:49.380> actually<00:01:49.740> go<00:01:49.890> away<00:01:50.100> with

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
that issue will actually go away with

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.910 
that issue will actually go away with
resharpening<00:01:51.000> over<00:01:51.270> time<00:01:51.540> but<00:01:52.229> still<00:01:52.439> no<00:01:52.770> it's

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
resharpening over time but still no it's

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.800 
resharpening over time but still no it's
not<00:01:53.070> something<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.820> should<00:01:54.060> get<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.450> special

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
not something you should get a special

this<00:02:42.520> knife<00:02:42.730> though<00:02:43.000> I<00:02:43.240> just<00:02:43.960> have<00:02:44.050> to

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
this knife though I just have to

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.770 
this knife though I just have to
resharpen<00:02:44.590> it<00:02:44.860> I'm<00:02:45.820> thinking<00:02:46.090> just<00:02:46.390> taking

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
resharpen it I'm thinking just taking

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.770 
resharpen it I'm thinking just taking
decent<00:02:47.170> amount<00:02:47.410> of<00:02:47.530> mellow<00:02:47.800> from<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.190> edge

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
decent amount of mellow from the edge

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.930 
decent amount of mellow from the edge
might<00:02:49.780> as<00:02:49.870> well<00:02:49.930> convex<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.740> very<00:02:51.340> edge<00:02:51.580> try

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
might as well convex the very edge try

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.790 
might as well convex the very edge try
not<00:02:52.180> to<00:02:52.360> do<00:02:52.450> anything<00:02:52.720> with<00:02:53.020> this<00:02:53.140> just<00:02:53.380> convex

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
not to do anything with this just convex

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.430 
not to do anything with this just convex
