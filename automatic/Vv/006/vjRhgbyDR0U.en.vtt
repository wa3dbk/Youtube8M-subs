00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 collect almería your channel you know that I 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.339
 I am would be this time I'm going to 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.690
 present an application that will help us 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.040
 to record the screen of our 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.950
 Android device in a way 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.960
 pretty effective pretty simple that already 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.299
 be it for recording I do not know tutorials 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.650
 gameplays on our android device 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.210
 now it's pretty good like that 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:25.690
 how we started with this video 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:25.690
 [Music] 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.800
 good people the present that I have 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.110
 present today is pretty 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.580
 simple is called show is this we see 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.380
 here we can find it totally 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.640
 free on the place thor and then as already 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.560
 You will see on the screen 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.080
 help will help to record the screen of 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.550
 our android device without any 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.410
 program as I say to record 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.059
 tutorials just then to teach 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.070
 to our friends or anything else 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.540
 not as I said the application is in 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.460
 we're going to go into it so that 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.780
 see more or less of what is going on in this same 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.300
 we can do what would come 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.710
 direct types of what would come 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.020
 some games for example here we have 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.170
 some options in this case for 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.489
 example the my craft we can find 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.589
 some some users who are 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.390
 doing so to speak direct from 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.119
 this game we can find some 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.500
 players some other games and 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.450
 install the game if we do not have it 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.550
 installed not like for example the 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.170
 clan classes let's find 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.180
 infinities of games here that are 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.820
 doing then gameplays in their direct 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.259
 no mother konko geometry and that good 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.270
 quite a few games in case you also 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.680
 we want to entertain ourselves not if we go towards 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.420
 One side, we find the last 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.190
 transmissions in this case those that are 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.060
 live for example that would be 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.159
 for example are you fifa this one 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.020
 André and well the truth is that 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.700
 pretty good in this game for 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.990
 record with wes I here I am recording the 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.420
 screen then it does not show us 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.210
 many things in this account simply 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.070
 it has seemed to us one thing in the 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.509
 which is leaving you capture where 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.880
 it teaches us then we simply have to 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.380
 press to start recording on 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.970
 this side we have the configurations in 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.740
 this case our account that we have to 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.259
 achieve us once installed the 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.850
 application to be able to record and then for 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.350
 example the record and we can see the 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.270
 tests that we have here for example 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.100
 the recordings that we have made 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.140
 recently we can not go towards a 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.670
 side we can go to settings that would come 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.259
 being the configurations of the 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.450
 recording in this case for example in 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.910
 video we can change in what format 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.190
 we want you to save the video this from 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.560
 I'm not sure which is lie 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.720
 example in contain that I do not know either 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.489
 very good for what is that we have for 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.140
 example the orientation that as we want 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:27.069
 that the video is recorded either 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.380
 automatically from a horizontal side 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.810
 well here we change it we can change 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.209
 the resolution down to the lowest up 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.010
 1080 to the lowest that is the 40 p 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.190
 up to the highest that between being cool 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.670
 hd 1080 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:43.610
 we would have for example the ay we have 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.900
 this thing that is for the speed that 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.880
 I think that at the speed that 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.440
 we want you to record us more or less and 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.910
 well we can place this that is 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.410
 to show us the touches as you see 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.850
 here so that later on in case 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.330
 you want to record a tutorial or something for the 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.380
 style because it looks pretty good in the 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.420
 part of the audio we can record if 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.880
 we want we can put if we want that 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.260
 record us with audio either by 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.050
 example the silence that interests in the 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.880
 first with the microphone that indra but 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.740
 the second or with it seems to me that it is 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.990
 economic an external microphone with 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.700
 saying the third we will not have here 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.710
 some other things and good for example 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.310
 here for good this would be for what 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.890
 it is being 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.000
 this the direct ones that I already told you and 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.860
 Well, here are some other 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.200
 configurations of the application already 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.450
 it's not true that it's pretty enough 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.040
 well in the part the notifications 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.840
 when we start recording how can you 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.970
 observe we get a notification of 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.550
 that is recording and the weight that is 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.090
 accumulating the video in this case by 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.500
 example if you for example when 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.060
 you finish recording when you already 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.030
 you finished recording the only thing you have 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.069
 what to do then is close here go to 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.810
 put him where he says pause and 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.880
 automatically I would be saving you the 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.810
 recording in this case for example then 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.420
 I'm not going to do it because obviously 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.209
 I'm recording and for example that other 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.680
 thing then we can also close it from 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.660
 here from where it says stop and good 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.890
 basically that's not the truth is that the 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.720
 application is quite simple 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.250
 it works perfectly as you see it does not go down 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.049
 for nothing the performance of our 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.299
 device then the truth is that 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:10.410
 it's pretty pretty good then in 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.299
 that aspect there is no kind of 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.000
 problem we can use the application 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:16.590
 totally good is free in the 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.519
 appstore then I leave the link in the 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.139
 description so you can go to 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.639
 download it and that is if I help you 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.169
 studies if you liked you can support me 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:23.750
 Looking at him I like this video commenting 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:26.220
 What do you think 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.050
 to find more interesting videos 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.460
 about this since I have I'm going to try to 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.900
 upload other applications in case 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.380
 it does not work for you to record 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.880
 the screen of your android device 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.200
 and well, with nothing more to say 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.330
 I hope you liked this video 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:41.560
 I hope you have an excellent day and we 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.560
 we see until the next
