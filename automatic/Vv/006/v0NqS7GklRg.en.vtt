00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.410 
only welding about an inch at a time and
then<00:01:26.030> tainting<00:01:26.450> it<00:01:26.570> over<00:01:27.640> this<00:01:28.640> rod<00:01:28.940> they<00:01:29.180> tell

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
then tainting it over this rod they tell

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.850 
then tainting it over this rod they tell
you<00:01:29.540> not<00:01:29.690> to<00:01:29.750> preheat<00:01:30.350> you<00:01:30.470> don't<00:01:30.619> have<00:01:30.740> to

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
you not to preheat you don't have to

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.280 
you not to preheat you don't have to
preheat<00:01:31.300> so<00:01:32.300> we're<00:01:32.450> going<00:01:32.570> to<00:01:32.659> try<00:01:32.869> and<00:01:33.080> see<00:01:33.259> if

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
preheat so we're going to try and see if

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.770 
preheat so we're going to try and see if
it's<00:01:33.790> you<00:01:34.790> know<00:01:34.820> it<00:01:35.000> works<00:01:35.210> that<00:01:35.420> way<00:01:35.570> usually

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
it's you know it works that way usually

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.499 
it's you know it works that way usually
will<00:01:36.229> preheat<00:01:36.530> it<00:01:36.820> and<00:01:37.820> if<00:01:37.909> we<00:01:38.030> have<00:01:38.210> to<00:01:38.360> we

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
will preheat it and if we have to we

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.330 
will preheat it and if we have to we
will<00:01:38.540> but<00:01:40.030> let's<00:01:41.030> see<00:01:41.210> how<00:01:41.330> to<00:01:41.390> stop<00:01:41.720> acts<00:01:42.340> all

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
will but let's see how to stop acts all

huge step is a monumental in this
progress<00:05:23.259> here<00:05:23.699> because<00:05:24.699> without<00:05:25.270> these

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:25.539 
progress here because without these

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:28.830 
progress here because without these
welded<00:05:25.960> together<00:05:26.080> like<00:05:26.470> this<00:05:27.150> we<00:05:28.150> really<00:05:28.419> I<00:05:28.449> I

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
welded together like this we really I I

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.480 
welded together like this we really I I
couldn't<00:05:29.229> do<00:05:29.379> anything<00:05:29.620> more<00:05:29.740> am<00:05:30.009> I<00:05:30.129> couldn't

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
couldn't do anything more am I couldn't

couldn't do anything more am I couldn't
anything<00:05:30.669> else<00:05:30.879> but<00:05:31.419> now<00:05:31.569> that<00:05:31.690> they're

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
anything else but now that they're

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.219 
anything else but now that they're
welded<00:05:31.990> together<00:05:32.610> my<00:05:33.610> can<00:05:33.849> start<00:05:34.810> working<00:05:34.990> on

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:35.229 
welded together my can start working on

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:38.279 
welded together my can start working on
the<00:05:35.289> crankshaft<00:05:35.710> the<00:05:36.069> camshaft<00:05:37.110> all<00:05:38.110> the

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:38.289 
the crankshaft the camshaft all the

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:40.080 
the crankshaft the camshaft all the
modifications<00:05:38.650> are<00:05:39.250> the<00:05:39.340> internals<00:05:39.849> of<00:05:39.940> this

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
modifications are the internals of this

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.510 
modifications are the internals of this
and<00:05:41.039> I<00:05:42.039> can<00:05:42.400> start<00:05:42.639> working<00:05:42.819> on<00:05:43.030> their<00:05:43.210> heads

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
and I can start working on their heads

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:50.430 
and I can start working on their heads
gotta<00:05:45.520> cut<00:05:45.729> the<00:05:45.879> head<00:05:48.900> so<00:05:49.900> much<00:05:50.050> bigger<00:05:50.259> that

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
gotta cut the head so much bigger that

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.869 
gotta cut the head so much bigger that
is<00:05:50.849> so<00:05:51.849> I<00:05:51.909> can<00:05:52.120> cut<00:05:52.629> the<00:05:52.780> heads<00:05:53.020> and<00:05:53.699> make<00:05:54.699> the

00:05:54.869 --> 00:05:54.879 
is so I can cut the heads and make the

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:57.390 
is so I can cut the heads and make the
intake<00:05:55.330> manifold<00:05:55.930> and<00:05:56.229> exhaust<00:05:56.620> manifolds

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
intake manifold and exhaust manifolds

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.089 
intake manifold and exhaust manifolds
and<00:05:58.150> most<00:05:59.020> importantly<00:05:59.469> I<00:05:59.560> can<00:05:59.650> start<00:05:59.979> working

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:00.099 
and most importantly I can start working

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:01.830 
and most importantly I can start working
on<00:06:00.280> the<00:06:00.370> base<00:06:00.580> connecting<00:06:01.389> them<00:06:01.509> all<00:06:01.659> together

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 
on the base connecting them all together

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.689 
on the base connecting them all together
welding<00:06:02.409> them<00:06:02.500> up<00:06:03.690> so<00:06:05.190> that's<00:06:06.190> where<00:06:06.400> we're<00:06:06.550> at

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:06.699 
welding them up so that's where we're at

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:10.110 
welding them up so that's where we're at
I<00:06:07.319> say<00:06:08.319> this<00:06:08.409> was<00:06:08.620> huge<00:06:08.949> this<00:06:09.610> is<00:06:09.669> part<00:06:10.060> of

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
I say this was huge this is part of

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.769 
I say this was huge this is part of
