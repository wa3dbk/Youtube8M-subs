00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 this remedy is not easy for anyone nor 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.690
 even for the class name of the book of 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.690
 alice debut thicker than pec 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:24.449
 narrative but triumphed at the original age 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:26.490
 then guides the cover of the book already 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.460
 makes a suspense is saying he has a 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.619
 secret and this already leaves the reader 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.540
 A little more attentive when you go 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.510
 to enter the story the first 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.329
 The impression you have is that the five 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.210
 friends who will tell the story are 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.340
 very exciting and you can not even 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.590
 to care about their history with the 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.660
 problems because you want more 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.789
 that they all die as you go 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.329
 advancing narrative you lose 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.090
 several clues sure why book him 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.829
 has a certain cohesion 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.770
 beginning of the story that you will 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.870
 identifying some problems some 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.760
 things that do not make sense and you 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.950
 begins to think the secret that was already 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.960
 announced on the cover I do not know if it's because I 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.270
 I have read many books but in the 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.549
 to criticize a book for an analysis is 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.560
 impossible you do not carry along 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.930
 I get all the books you already have 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.350
 in your life're so although the 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.840
 story is original native is not so much 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.869
 so then before the middle of the book 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.970
 before long before you reveal in which 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.009
 It's a secret to me, it's a secret. 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.229
 obvious what the author might not 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.630
 I was counting and of course this 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.270
 decreased the intensity of the effect 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.000
 secret should have on me for 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.560
 I told you what a wonderful book. 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.570
 because we love being cheated on 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.740
 people love to be surprised at the end 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.360
 people do not reach the end of the book speaks 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.860
 I never imagined that this could 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.689
 to happen 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.799
 on the other hand the main character 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:02:00.140
 here in 359 at the beginning already leaves much 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:02.810
 face that is the character who sent all 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.000
 world that does what happens is the reindeer and 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.950
 is a very multifaceted character 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.140
 but making even more 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.900
 multifaceted as you move forward in 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.300
 the story after you read the book 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.880
 will understand why the biggest problem 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.250
 narrative is that since the secret is not 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.860
 very surprising it should have been 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.260
 faced more in the beginning than it flies 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.180
 secret there after the half book is the 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.209
 alex who is the boyfriend of the reindeer and what 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.120
 he does at the beginning of his narrative is 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.799
 rereading everything you have ever seen or 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.350
 whether it is calling the voter of 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:37.970
 dumb ass what the smart reader will 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.950
 do from the moment he knows 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.410
 What is the secret he's going to interpret? 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.299
 automatically everything he joel 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.090
 no need to go down in history 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:49.310
 all from Alex's point of view knowing 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.830
 already the secret so that everything becomes so 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.440
 so obvious after the story progresses and 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.390
 everything returns to normal 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.850
 only this time narrated by boyfriend 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.890
 income and no longer for the five friends who 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.350
 even more than half the story 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.250
 and then you have a technical closing 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.200
 interesting 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.329
 I think it's really cute and who was the 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.150
 boy and it was the recent old school 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:13.010
 especially if you will identify yourself 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.170
 very sure I recommend this book for 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.600
 account of his originality is 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.519
 fascinating as an author the first part 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.579
 of the book although she gave many clues 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:25.220
 at least cover it later when 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:27.319
 You get to understand the secret, you know. 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.180
 That's for you to understand. 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.730
 it is plausible that the whole first part of the 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.190
 history has happened even with these 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.950
 secrets and not recurrent truth in 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:40.549
 people lives there so this is it 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:43.100
 the class will take two or toninho your 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:46.310
 pretty original book will enchant 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.989
 a lot of people but for me it's native could 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.630
 have been much better crafted to 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.080
 to delight even more people and 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.270
 bands 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.820
 age also hope you 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.820
 liked this video scared click 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:01.190

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.130
