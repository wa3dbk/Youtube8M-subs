00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.680 
a four and an old version before and the
way<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.220> can<00:02:02.340> tell<00:02:02.490> when<00:02:03.120> they<00:02:03.270> wear<00:02:03.570> out<00:02:03.840> is

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
way you can tell when they wear out is

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.999 
way you can tell when they wear out is
the<00:02:06.690> bristles<00:02:07.110> will<00:02:07.260> become<00:02:07.560> shorter<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:10.009> the

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
the bristles will become shorter and the

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.370 
the bristles will become shorter and the
brush<00:02:11.310> has<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.489> tendency<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:11.970> flare<00:02:12.480> if<00:02:12.840> you<00:02:13.170> see

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
brush has a tendency to flare if you see

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.750 
brush has a tendency to flare if you see
here<00:02:13.560> if<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:13.740> turn<00:02:13.950> on<00:02:13.980> edge

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
here if I turn on edge

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.179 
here if I turn on edge
see<00:02:15.299> how<00:02:15.420> this<00:02:15.569> one<00:02:15.780> here<00:02:16.049> is<00:02:16.200> fatter<00:02:16.709> than

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:17.189 
see how this one here is fatter than

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:19.490 
see how this one here is fatter than
this<00:02:17.370> one<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:17.819> what<00:02:18.420> happens<00:02:19.019> and<00:02:19.200> this<00:02:19.319> is

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
this one and what happens and this is

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.600 
this one and what happens and this is
important<00:02:20.269> paint<00:02:21.269> gets<00:02:21.870> down<00:02:22.230> inside<00:02:22.610> this

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
important paint gets down inside this

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.130 
important paint gets down inside this
part<00:02:24.030> of<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:24.329> brushes<00:02:24.689> is<00:02:24.810> called<00:02:25.019> the

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
part of the brushes is called the

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.259 
part of the brushes is called the
ferrule<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:25.709> what<00:02:26.189> happens<00:02:26.519> is<00:02:26.640> it<00:02:26.760> hardens

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
ferrule and what happens is it hardens

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.619 
ferrule and what happens is it hardens
and<00:02:27.420> it<00:02:27.900> makes<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.439> brush<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:30.000> bristles<00:02:30.569> I

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
and it makes the brush the bristles I

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.300 
and it makes the brush the bristles I
don't<00:02:30.780> want<00:02:30.930> to<00:02:31.019> flare<00:02:31.319> out<00:02:31.349> because<00:02:32.190> the

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
don't want to flare out because the

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.819 
don't want to flare out because the
paint<00:02:32.519> gets<00:02:32.730> down<00:02:33.030> inside<00:02:33.269> there<00:02:33.690> d<00:02:33.930> so<00:02:34.620> once

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
paint gets down inside there d so once

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:37.789 
paint gets down inside there d so once
it<00:02:35.010> starts<00:02:35.340> to<00:02:35.519> flare<00:02:35.790> out<00:02:35.849> a<00:02:36.239> lot<00:02:36.900> and<00:02:37.260> this<00:02:37.590> is

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
it starts to flare out a lot and this is

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.309 
it starts to flare out a lot and this is
um<00:02:38.040> this<00:02:38.670> is<00:02:38.909> right<00:02:39.329> on<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.659> edge<00:02:39.840> if<00:02:40.170> it

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
um this is right on the edge if it

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:41.630 
um this is right on the edge if it
flares<00:02:40.500> out<00:02:40.680> much<00:02:40.859> more<00:02:40.890> off<00:02:41.190> to<00:02:41.310> throw<00:02:41.519> it

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
flares out much more off to throw it

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.479 
flares out much more off to throw it
away<00:02:41.730> or<00:02:42.090> make<00:02:42.540> one<00:02:42.720> of<00:02:42.900> these<00:02:43.500> brushes<00:02:43.950> out<00:02:44.280> of

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
away or make one of these brushes out of

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.780 
away or make one of these brushes out of
it<00:02:44.609> these<00:02:45.269> little<00:02:45.420> pointers<00:02:46.640> but<00:02:47.640> what

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
it these little pointers but what

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.809 
it these little pointers but what
happens<00:02:47.819> is<00:02:48.329> one<00:02:48.510> that<00:02:48.690> starts<00:02:49.079> to<00:02:49.260> flare<00:02:49.819> you

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
happens is one that starts to flare you

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.500 
happens is one that starts to flare you
will<00:02:51.120> have<00:02:51.870> to<00:02:52.109> throw<00:02:52.709> it<00:02:52.739> out<00:02:53.120> and<00:02:54.120> you<00:02:54.329> see

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
will have to throw it out and you see

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.270 
will have to throw it out and you see
it's<00:02:54.629> also<00:02:54.840> starting<00:02:55.260> to<00:02:55.290> where<00:02:55.500> it's<00:02:56.010> a

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
it's also starting to where it's a

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.410 
it's also starting to where it's a
little<00:02:56.579> bit<00:02:56.700> like<00:02:56.849> an<00:02:56.970> eighth<00:02:57.090> of<00:02:57.239> an<00:02:57.359> inch

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
little bit like an eighth of an inch

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.119 
little bit like an eighth of an inch
shorter<00:02:57.930> than<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.230> other<00:02:58.260> one<00:02:58.620> in<00:02:58.739> terms<00:02:58.950> of

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
shorter than the other one in terms of

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:03.710 
shorter than the other one in terms of
the<00:03:00.560> how<00:03:01.560> much<00:03:01.709> hair<00:03:01.980> is<00:03:02.099> there<00:03:02.450> and<00:03:03.450> this<00:03:03.540> one

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
the how much hair is there and this one

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.420 
the how much hair is there and this one
isn't<00:03:03.870> brand<00:03:04.230> new<00:03:04.409> so<00:03:04.709> if<00:03:04.799> I<00:03:04.889> had<00:03:04.980> a<00:03:05.010> brand<00:03:05.280> new

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
isn't brand new so if I had a brand new

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
isn't brand new so if I had a brand new
one<00:03:05.579> and<00:03:05.700> probably<00:03:05.849> a<00:03:06.060> little<00:03:06.510> bit<00:03:06.690> longer<00:03:08.450> and

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
one and probably a little bit longer and

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.879 
one and probably a little bit longer and
I'm<00:03:09.659> going<00:03:09.870> to<00:03:09.930> talk<00:03:09.989> about<00:03:10.170> washing<00:03:10.650> Peggy

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:10.889 
I'm going to talk about washing Peggy

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:13.479 
I'm going to talk about washing Peggy
wash<00:03:11.099> brushes<00:03:11.430> here<00:03:11.730> in<00:03:11.970> a<00:03:12.180> few<00:03:12.329> minutes<00:03:12.389> and

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
wash brushes here in a few minutes and

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.069 
wash brushes here in a few minutes and
that's<00:03:14.489> how<00:03:14.760> you'll<00:03:15.000> keep<00:03:15.239> that<00:03:15.510> from<00:03:15.810> this

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
that's how you'll keep that from this

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:18.379 
that's how you'll keep that from this
flaring<00:03:16.590> tip<00:03:16.889> from<00:03:17.190> happening<00:03:17.700> but<00:03:18.120> it<00:03:18.239> just

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
flaring tip from happening but it just

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:21.589 
flaring tip from happening but it just
is<00:03:18.540> going<00:03:18.690> to<00:03:18.750> have<00:03:18.900> no<00:03:19.079> matter<00:03:19.290> what<00:03:20.599> so

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
is going to have no matter what so

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:22.759 
is going to have no matter what so
that's<00:03:21.720> how<00:03:21.900> you<00:03:21.959> can<00:03:22.139> tell<00:03:22.169> if<00:03:22.319> your<00:03:22.470> brushes

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
that's how you can tell if your brushes

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.229 
that's how you can tell if your brushes
are<00:03:22.889> getting<00:03:23.069> old<00:03:23.220> and<00:03:23.400> your<00:03:23.699> brushes<00:03:24.030> should

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
are getting old and your brushes should

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.839 
are getting old and your brushes should
have<00:03:24.389> a<00:03:24.419> beautiful<00:03:25.260> nice<00:03:25.470> spring<00:03:26.040> to<00:03:26.340> them<00:03:26.459> if

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
have a beautiful nice spring to them if

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:28.699 
have a beautiful nice spring to them if
they<00:03:27.090> don't<00:03:27.359> and<00:03:27.599> they're<00:03:27.840> all<00:03:27.989> stiff<00:03:28.410> then

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
they don't and they're all stiff then

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.220 
they don't and they're all stiff then
you're<00:03:28.919> ready<00:03:29.099> for<00:03:29.370> new<00:03:29.459> brushes<00:03:29.760> and<00:03:30.230> people

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
we are too slow to replace their brushes

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.050 
we are too slow to replace their brushes
they<00:03:34.829> need<00:03:35.010> it<00:03:35.129> you<00:03:35.280> need<00:03:35.310> to<00:03:35.459> get<00:03:35.639> rid<00:03:35.760> of<00:03:35.819> when

they're bad get new ones okay now what

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.140 
they're bad get new ones okay now what
I'll<00:03:39.629> do<00:03:39.840> is<00:03:39.930> talk<00:03:40.079> about<00:03:40.109> palette<00:03:40.590> knives

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
I'll do is talk about palette knives

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.640 
I'll do is talk about palette knives
these<00:03:42.150> are<00:03:42.299> the<00:03:42.389> type<00:03:42.569> of<00:03:42.599> fountains<00:03:43.109> I<00:03:43.260> like

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
these are the type of fountains I like

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.430 
these are the type of fountains I like
to<00:03:43.829> use<00:03:44.069> and<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:45.150> reason<00:03:45.599> I<00:03:45.720> like<00:03:45.989> these<00:03:47.120> is

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
to use and the reason I like these is

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.050 
to use and the reason I like these is
because<00:03:49.440> the<00:03:49.769> small<00:03:50.040> ones<00:03:50.250> i<00:03:50.340> can<00:03:50.489> do<00:03:50.579> detail

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
because the small ones i can do detail

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.849 
because the small ones i can do detail
work<00:03:51.389> with<00:03:51.720> and<00:03:52.019> then<00:03:52.799> this<00:03:52.949> larger<00:03:53.519> one<00:03:54.859> go

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
work with and then this larger one go

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
with them what I'll end when I show you

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.020 
with them what I'll end when I show you
some<00:04:10.829> background<00:04:11.010> techniques<00:04:11.579> I'll<00:04:11.760> show<00:04:11.879> you

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
some background techniques I'll show you

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.430 
some background techniques I'll show you
some<00:04:12.269> cool<00:04:12.479> things<00:04:12.840> you<00:04:12.989> can<00:04:13.079> do<00:04:13.229> to

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
some cool things you can do to

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.469 
some cool things you can do to
backgrounds<00:04:14.280> with<00:04:14.400> these<00:04:14.549> now<00:04:14.940> the<00:04:15.000> reason<00:04:15.239> I

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:15.479 
backgrounds with these now the reason I

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:18.050 
backgrounds with these now the reason I
like<00:04:15.720> these<00:04:16.019> is<00:04:16.380> they're<00:04:16.709> rounded<00:04:17.370> all<00:04:17.549> the

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
like these is they're rounded all the

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.759 
like these is they're rounded all the
way<00:04:18.209> around<00:04:18.389> they<00:04:18.959> don't<00:04:19.109> have<00:04:19.229> any<00:04:19.409> sharp

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
way around they don't have any sharp

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.219 
way around they don't have any sharp
corners<00:04:20.250> let<00:04:20.880> me<00:04:21.000> show<00:04:21.299> you<00:04:21.359> what<00:04:21.690> one<00:04:21.900> looks

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
corners let me show you what one looks

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:26.719 
corners let me show you what one looks
like<00:04:24.560> this<00:04:25.560> is<00:04:25.740> what<00:04:25.889> one<00:04:26.039> looks<00:04:26.310> like<00:04:26.400> with<00:04:26.700> a

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729 
like this is what one looks like with a

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:27.870 
like this is what one looks like with a
sharp<00:04:27.090> corner

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
sharp corner

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.090 
sharp corner
it<00:04:28.000> comes<00:04:28.240> to<00:04:28.570> a<00:04:28.600> point<00:04:28.660> here<00:04:29.350> and<00:04:29.590> we're

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
it comes to a point here and we're

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.770 
it comes to a point here and we're
that's<00:04:30.340> bad<00:04:30.640> as<00:04:30.820> if<00:04:30.970> you're<00:04:31.120> scraping<00:04:31.390> off

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
that's bad as if you're scraping off

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.450 
that's bad as if you're scraping off
these<00:04:32.230> sharp<00:04:32.560> points<00:04:32.920> who<00:04:32.980> have<00:04:33.070> a<00:04:33.100> tendency

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
these sharp points who have a tendency

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.460 
these sharp points who have a tendency
to<00:04:33.490> dig<00:04:33.760> in<00:04:33.910> the<00:04:34.000> canvas<00:04:34.240> and<00:04:34.540> appeals<00:04:35.230> the

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
to dig in the canvas and appeals the

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.530 
to dig in the canvas and appeals the
paint<00:04:35.710> completely<00:04:36.010> off<00:04:36.490> in<00:04:36.820> that<00:04:36.910> spot<00:04:37.270> leaves

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
paint completely off in that spot leaves

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.360 
paint completely off in that spot leaves
a<00:04:37.660> mark<00:04:37.870> whereas<00:04:38.500> these<00:04:38.650> round<00:04:39.010> ones<00:04:39.220> will

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
a mark whereas these round ones will

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.290 
a mark whereas these round ones will
have<00:04:39.460> less<00:04:39.880> of<00:04:40.090> a<00:04:40.150> tendency<00:04:40.480> to<00:04:40.810> do<00:04:40.960> that<00:04:41.170> so

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
have less of a tendency to do that so

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.910 
have less of a tendency to do that so
these<00:04:43.300> particular<00:04:43.660> ones<00:04:43.870> are<00:04:44.140> creative<00:04:44.500> craft

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:44.920 
these particular ones are creative craft

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.760 
these particular ones are creative craft
they're<00:04:45.460> made<00:04:45.730> by<00:04:46.110> the<00:04:47.110> company<00:04:47.350> that<00:04:47.590> owns

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
they're made by the company that owns

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.660 
they're made by the company that owns
Jerry's<00:04:48.310> and<00:04:48.490> aunt<00:04:48.700> a<00:04:48.970> SW<00:04:50.040> America<00:04:51.040> what<00:04:51.370> is<00:04:51.490> it

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:51.670 
Jerry's and aunt a SW America what is it

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:56.550 
Jerry's and aunt a SW America what is it
own<00:04:52.200> art<00:04:53.200> supply<00:04:54.070> warehouse<00:04:54.100> I<00:04:55.470> think<00:04:56.470> they

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
own art supply warehouse I think they

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.310 
own art supply warehouse I think they
own<00:04:56.770> this<00:04:56.980> company<00:04:57.190> called<00:04:57.580> creative<00:04:57.970> mark

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
own this company called creative mark

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.110 
own this company called creative mark
but<00:04:59.320> anyway<00:04:59.560> so<00:05:00.130> it's<00:05:00.280> kind<00:05:00.520> of<00:05:00.550> a<00:05:00.670> knockoff

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
but anyway so it's kind of a knockoff

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.170 
but anyway so it's kind of a knockoff
company<00:05:01.570> so<00:05:01.720> the<00:05:01.810> brushes<00:05:02.170> are<00:05:02.350> and<00:05:02.500> the<00:05:03.180> pound

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
company so the brushes are and the pound

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.960 
company so the brushes are and the pound
lines<00:05:04.390> are<00:05:04.570> pretty<00:05:04.690> inexpensive<00:05:05.760> but<00:05:06.760> I

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
lines are pretty inexpensive but I

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.340 
lines are pretty inexpensive but I
really<00:05:07.240> like<00:05:07.420> the<00:05:07.570> shape<00:05:07.600> of<00:05:07.960> these<00:05:08.050> and<00:05:08.290> I

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
really like the shape of these and I

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.780 
really like the shape of these and I
think<00:05:08.560> you<00:05:08.620> probably<00:05:08.770> find<00:05:09.160> these<00:05:09.310> shapes<00:05:09.550> in

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:09.790 
think you probably find these shapes in

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.640 
think you probably find these shapes in
other<00:05:09.970> companies<00:05:10.450> but<00:05:11.020> that's<00:05:11.170> just<00:05:11.290> what<00:05:11.530> I'm

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
other companies but that's just what I'm

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:17.880 
other companies but that's just what I'm
used<00:05:11.980> okay<00:05:12.760> now<00:05:13.420> this<00:05:13.930> one<00:05:14.200> is<00:05:14.340> 81<00:05:15.340> 82<00:05:16.030> and<00:05:16.600> a<00:05:17.140> t7

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:17.890 
used okay now this one is 81 82 and a t7
