and<00:01:05.970> stuff<00:01:07.280> pay<00:01:08.280> these<00:01:08.580> two<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:10.070> think<00:01:11.070> are<00:01:11.250> the

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
and stuff pay these two I think are the

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.160 
and stuff pay these two I think are the
softest<00:01:12.689> brushes<00:01:13.680> out<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:15.170> smaller

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
softest brushes out of the smaller

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.160 
softest brushes out of the smaller
brushes<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:17.549> just<00:01:17.880> looked<00:01:18.090> at<00:01:18.210> these<00:01:18.840> for

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
brushes that I just looked at these for

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.960 
brushes that I just looked at these for
I<00:01:19.409> guess<00:01:20.009> because<00:01:20.159> these<00:01:20.369> are<00:01:20.549> synthetic

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
I guess because these are synthetic

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.810 
I guess because these are synthetic
entities<00:01:21.560> have<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.710> authentic<00:01:23.130> hairs<00:01:23.430> or

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
entities have the authentic hairs or

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.740 
entities have the authentic hairs or
just<00:01:24.090> really<00:01:24.570> soft<00:01:25.080> spot<00:01:25.470> synthetic<00:01:26.040> hairs<00:01:26.250> I

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
just really soft spot synthetic hairs I

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.260 
just really soft spot synthetic hairs I
love<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.869> but<00:01:28.409> unfortunately<00:01:28.560> these<00:01:29.490> two<00:01:29.820> also

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
love it but unfortunately these two also

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.590 
love it but unfortunately these two also
have<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:31.049> most<00:01:31.320> fallout<00:01:32.159> 4<00:01:32.509> bristles<00:01:34.220> but

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
have the most fallout 4 bristles but

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.910 
have the most fallout 4 bristles but
actually<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.720> angled<00:01:37.110> one<00:01:37.259> has<00:01:37.439> more<00:01:37.650> fallout

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
actually the angled one has more fallout

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.730 
actually the angled one has more fallout
than<00:01:38.280> this<00:01:38.820> one<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.390> don't<00:01:39.810> know<00:01:39.990> why<00:01:40.229> maybe<00:01:40.590> I

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
than this one I don't know why maybe I

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.289 
than this one I don't know why maybe I
wash<00:01:41.070> this<00:01:41.520> one<00:01:41.759> more<00:01:43.009> maybe<00:01:44.009> that's<00:01:44.189> why<00:01:44.490> but

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
wash this one more maybe that's why but

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.389 
wash this one more maybe that's why but
