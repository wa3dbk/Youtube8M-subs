00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.160 
and loop it back through so basically
all<00:01:54.610> you're<00:01:54.880> doing<00:01:55.119> is<00:01:55.270> taking<00:01:55.450> a<00:01:55.720> section<00:01:56.049> of

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
all you're doing is taking a section of

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.899 
all you're doing is taking a section of
hair<00:01:56.350> looping<00:01:57.130> it<00:01:57.250> through<00:01:57.549> and<00:01:57.759> then

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
hair looping it through and then

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.850 
hair looping it through and then
continuing<00:01:58.600> to<00:01:58.720> add<00:01:58.840> hair<00:01:59.259> to<00:01:59.290> that<00:01:59.530> section

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
continuing to add hair to that section

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.670 
continuing to add hair to that section
and<00:02:00.220> looping<00:02:00.579> it<00:02:00.700> through<00:02:00.880> the<00:02:01.000> headband<00:02:01.680> so

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
and looping it through the headband so

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.139 
and looping it through the headband so
now<00:02:02.829> I'm<00:02:02.950> just<00:02:03.100> going<00:02:03.280> to<00:02:03.399> loop<00:02:03.579> that<00:02:03.790> through

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
now I'm just going to loop that through

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:06.749 
now I'm just going to loop that through
and<00:02:04.659> make<00:02:05.619> sure<00:02:05.770> you<00:02:05.890> get<00:02:06.040> all<00:02:06.280> of<00:02:06.430> the<00:02:06.549> hair

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
and make sure you get all of the hair

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:12.589 
and make sure you get all of the hair
into<00:02:07.000> the<00:02:07.240> loop

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.849 

so<00:02:13.599> once<00:02:13.810> again<00:02:13.959> I'm<00:02:14.200> going<00:02:14.379> to<00:02:14.530> take<00:02:14.709> that

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:14.859 
so once again I'm going to take that

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:16.770 
so once again I'm going to take that
section<00:02:15.159> add<00:02:15.549> some<00:02:15.939> hair<00:02:16.120> to<00:02:16.299> it<00:02:16.450> and<00:02:16.599> then

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
section add some hair to it and then

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:26.750 
section add some hair to it and then
loop<00:02:16.989> it<00:02:17.170> back<00:02:17.200> through<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.620> headband

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.660 

and<00:02:27.830> then<00:02:28.830> you're<00:02:29.010> just<00:02:29.159> going<00:02:29.430> to<00:02:29.519> continue

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
and then you're just going to continue

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.149 
and then you're just going to continue
the<00:02:30.150> same<00:02:30.330> process<00:02:30.599> all<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.620> way<00:02:31.709> back<00:02:31.950> until

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159 
the same process all the way back until

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:42.649 
the same process all the way back until
you<00:02:32.489> reach<00:02:32.670> halfway<00:02:33.000> around<00:02:33.450> your<00:02:33.810> head

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:42.659 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:45.059 

now<00:02:43.659> I'm<00:02:43.750> just<00:02:43.959> going<00:02:44.170> to<00:02:44.200> take<00:02:44.379> a<00:02:44.409> small<00:02:44.739> clip

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
now I'm just going to take a small clip

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:46.860 
now I'm just going to take a small clip
and<00:02:45.280> clip<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:45.790> last<00:02:46.030> section<00:02:46.420> of<00:02:46.510> hair<00:02:46.720> dye

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
and clip the last section of hair dye

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.630 
and clip the last section of hair dye
just<00:02:46.930> loop<00:02:47.349> through<00:02:47.500> the<00:02:47.650> headband<00:02:48.010> just<00:02:48.190> to

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
just loop through the headband just to

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.039 
just loop through the headband just to
make<00:02:48.790> sure<00:02:48.819> that<00:02:49.060> it<00:02:49.180> doesn't<00:02:49.360> fall<00:02:49.659> out<00:02:49.690> while

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
make sure that it doesn't fall out while

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:53.550 
make sure that it doesn't fall out while
I'm<00:02:50.140> doing<00:02:50.379> the<00:02:50.470> other<00:02:50.620> side<00:02:52.019> so<00:02:53.019> now<00:02:53.049> you<00:02:53.260> can

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
I'm doing the other side so now you can

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.680 
I'm doing the other side so now you can
move<00:02:53.769> to<00:02:53.799> the<00:02:54.040> other<00:02:54.129> side<00:02:54.580> and<00:02:54.909> just<00:02:55.180> repeat

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
move to the other side and just repeat

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.539 
move to the other side and just repeat
the<00:02:55.840> same<00:02:56.019> process<00:02:56.530> of<00:02:56.650> taking<00:02:56.860> a<00:02:57.099> section<00:02:57.340> of

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
the same process of taking a section of

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.759 
the same process of taking a section of
hair<00:02:57.730> looping<00:02:58.510> it<00:02:58.629> through<00:02:58.930> and<00:02:59.170> then<00:02:59.379> adding

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
hair looping it through and then adding

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.530 
hair looping it through and then adding
some<00:03:00.010> hair<00:03:00.190> to<00:03:00.310> that<00:03:00.430> section<00:03:00.730> and<00:03:01.060> looping<00:03:01.420> it

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
some hair to that section and looping it

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.330 
some hair to that section and looping it
back<00:03:01.720> through<00:03:01.989> all<00:03:02.200> the<00:03:02.680> way<00:03:02.769> until<00:03:03.129> you<00:03:03.220> reach

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
back through all the way until you reach

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:11.610 
back through all the way until you reach
halfway<00:03:04.090> around<00:03:04.239> your<00:03:04.569> head

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.900 

now<00:03:12.620> when<00:03:12.770> you<00:03:12.890> approach<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:13.490> middle<00:03:13.730> of<00:03:13.790> your

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
now when you approach the middle of your

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.580 
now when you approach the middle of your
head<00:03:14.120> this<00:03:14.360> is<00:03:14.480> where<00:03:14.660> a<00:03:14.690> lot<00:03:14.870> of<00:03:14.930> people<00:03:15.230> get

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
head this is where a lot of people get

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.500 
head this is where a lot of people get
confused<00:03:15.770> of<00:03:16.250> what<00:03:16.520> to<00:03:16.640> do<00:03:16.790> with<00:03:16.910> the<00:03:17.060> leftover

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
confused of what to do with the leftover

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.540 
confused of what to do with the leftover
hair<00:03:17.720> so<00:03:18.350> what<00:03:18.470> I<00:03:18.500> like<00:03:18.770> to<00:03:18.920> do<00:03:19.070> is<00:03:19.220> I<00:03:19.340> like<00:03:19.490> to

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
hair so what I like to do is I like to

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.550 
hair so what I like to do is I like to
make<00:03:19.670> pin<00:03:20.060> curls<00:03:20.420> out<00:03:20.600> of<00:03:20.720> the<00:03:20.870> leftover<00:03:21.350> hair

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
make pin curls out of the leftover hair

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.710 
make pin curls out of the leftover hair
and<00:03:21.830> then<00:03:22.640> just<00:03:22.880> secure<00:03:23.060> it<00:03:23.300> with<00:03:23.450> some<00:03:23.510> bobby

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
and then just secure it with some bobby

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.930 
and then just secure it with some bobby
pins<00:03:24.200> that<00:03:24.470> way<00:03:24.950> you're<00:03:25.130> not<00:03:25.160> forcing<00:03:25.760> any

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
pins that way you're not forcing any

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.910 
pins that way you're not forcing any
hair<00:03:26.240> into<00:03:26.480> the<00:03:26.570> headband<00:03:26.960> and<00:03:27.140> everything

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
hair into the headband and everything

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:38.530 
hair into the headband and everything
gets<00:03:28.130> curled<00:03:36.490> so<00:03:37.490> now<00:03:37.670> you<00:03:37.730> can<00:03:38.030> take<00:03:38.210> out<00:03:38.390> the

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
gets curled so now you can take out the

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.180 
gets curled so now you can take out the
clip<00:03:38.750> from<00:03:38.960> the<00:03:39.080> other<00:03:39.200> side<00:03:40.180> and<00:03:41.950> you're<00:03:42.950> just

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
clip from the other side and you're just

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.100 
clip from the other side and you're just
going<00:03:43.400> to<00:03:43.430> wrap<00:03:43.700> the<00:03:43.940> hair<00:03:44.180> around<00:03:44.210> two

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
going to wrap the hair around two

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.140 
going to wrap the hair around two
fingers<00:03:45.560> or<00:03:45.800> you<00:03:46.250> could<00:03:46.400> use<00:03:46.580> three<00:03:46.910> if<00:03:47.030> you

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
fingers or you could use three if you

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.260 
fingers or you could use three if you
want<00:03:47.270> the<00:03:47.450> curls<00:03:47.750> to<00:03:47.870> come<00:03:48.080> out<00:03:48.260> bigger<00:03:48.560> and

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
want the curls to come out bigger and

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.550 
want the curls to come out bigger and
you're<00:03:50.270> just<00:03:50.450> going<00:03:50.600> to<00:03:50.660> wrap<00:03:50.900> it<00:03:51.080> around<00:03:51.140> and

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
you're just going to wrap it around and

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.410 
you're just going to wrap it around and
then<00:03:51.830> pin<00:03:52.340> it<00:03:52.370> to<00:03:52.580> your<00:03:52.670> head<00:03:52.820> with<00:03:53.000> regular

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
then pin it to your head with regular

00:03:53.420 --> 00:04:02.010 
then pin it to your head with regular
bobby<00:03:53.630> pins

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.020 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.780 

I<00:04:02.080> find<00:04:02.530> that<00:04:02.620> if<00:04:02.710> you<00:04:02.830> try<00:04:03.040> to<00:04:03.070> stuff<00:04:03.460> all<00:04:03.670> of

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
I find that if you try to stuff all of

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.400 
I find that if you try to stuff all of
the<00:04:03.880> hair<00:04:04.060> into<00:04:04.210> the<00:04:04.240> headband<00:04:04.720> it'll<00:04:05.260> make

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
the hair into the headband it'll make

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.320 
the hair into the headband it'll make
the<00:04:05.560> headband<00:04:05.950> fall<00:04:06.250> down<00:04:06.520> and<00:04:06.790> the<00:04:07.090> curls

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
the headband fall down and the curls

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.210 
the headband fall down and the curls
will<00:04:07.420> come<00:04:07.660> out<00:04:07.810> crimpy<00:04:08.200> and<00:04:08.380> some<00:04:08.860> might<00:04:09.040> not

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
will come out crimpy and some might not

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.220 
will come out crimpy and some might not
curl<00:04:09.580> at<00:04:09.730> all<00:04:09.850> so<00:04:10.120> I<00:04:10.150> find<00:04:10.450> that<00:04:10.600> the<00:04:10.840> pin<00:04:11.020> curls
