the purpose of your warm-up should not

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.459 
the purpose of your warm-up should not
be<00:00:07.109> to<00:00:07.500> stretch<00:00:08.420> lengthen<00:00:09.420> or<00:00:09.660> increase<00:00:10.200> the

be to stretch lengthen or increase the
flexibility<00:00:11.370> of<00:00:11.400> your<00:00:11.610> muscles<00:00:12.450> in<00:00:12.900> reality

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
flexibility of your muscles in reality

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.400 
flexibility of your muscles in reality
the<00:00:14.549> purpose<00:00:15.000> of<00:00:15.269> your<00:00:15.509> warm-up<00:00:15.929> should<00:00:16.139> just

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
the purpose of your warm-up should just

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.410 
the purpose of your warm-up should just
be<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:16.800> warm<00:00:17.100> up<00:00:17.220> your<00:00:17.369> muscles<00:00:17.430> warm<00:00:18.119> up<00:00:18.270> your

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
be to warm up your muscles warm up your

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.620 
be to warm up your muscles warm up your
joints<00:00:18.449> and<00:00:19.109> reduce<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.250> chance<00:00:20.550> of<00:00:20.760> injury

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
joints and reduce the chance of injury

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.840 
joints and reduce the chance of injury
now<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.080> reason<00:00:22.560> behind<00:00:22.769> this<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.340> that

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
now the reason behind this is that

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.460 
now the reason behind this is that
tighter<00:00:24.750> muscles<00:00:25.470> actually<00:00:26.130> produce<00:00:26.430> more

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
tighter muscles actually produce more

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.439 
tighter muscles actually produce more
explosive<00:00:28.470> movement<00:00:29.010> if<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.580> are<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:30.029> stretch

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
explosive movement if you are to stretch

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.540 
explosive movement if you are to stretch
your<00:00:30.660> muscles<00:00:30.720> make<00:00:31.650> them<00:00:31.830> really<00:00:32.099> flexible

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
your muscles make them really flexible

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.940 
your muscles make them really flexible
make<00:00:32.820> them<00:00:32.969> really<00:00:33.210> loose<00:00:33.649> you're<00:00:34.649> not<00:00:34.800> going

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
make them really loose you're not going

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.830 
make them really loose you're not going
to<00:00:35.010> have<00:00:35.190> as<00:00:35.510> explosive<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.690> powerful

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
to have as explosive and powerful

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.810 
to have as explosive and powerful
movement<00:00:37.559> on<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.860> field<00:00:38.129> do<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.579> think<00:00:38.730> about

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
movement on the field do you think about

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.060 
movement on the field do you think about
learning<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.120> last<00:00:39.329> bend<00:00:39.780> it's<00:00:40.440> really<00:00:40.829> tight

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
learning the last bend it's really tight

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.860 
learning the last bend it's really tight
you<00:00:41.250> pull<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:41.940> last<00:00:42.090> bet<00:00:42.360> apart<00:00:42.719> it

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
you pull that it last bet apart it

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.779 
you pull that it last bet apart it
contracts<00:00:43.440> really<00:00:43.649> quickly<00:00:44.040> so<00:00:44.550> when<00:00:44.700> you

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
contracts really quickly so when you

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.940 
contracts really quickly so when you
have<00:00:44.940> tight<00:00:45.210> muscles<00:00:45.690> that's<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.590> science

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
have tight muscles that's the science

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.200 
have tight muscles that's the science
behind<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.430> you're<00:00:47.579> gonna<00:00:47.700> have<00:00:47.969> more

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
behind it you're gonna have more

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.250 
behind it you're gonna have more
explosive<00:00:48.660> movement<00:00:48.899> you're<00:00:48.989> gonna<00:00:49.079> be<00:00:49.200> able

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
explosive movement you're gonna be able

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.740 
explosive movement you're gonna be able
to<00:00:49.379> sprint<00:00:49.680> faster<00:00:50.190> take<00:00:50.670> harder<00:00:51.000> shots<00:00:51.270> jump

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
to sprint faster take harder shots jump

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.959 
to sprint faster take harder shots jump
higher<00:00:51.960> so<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.829> actually<00:00:53.100> want<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.520> keep<00:00:53.789> your

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
higher so you actually want to keep your

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.260 
higher so you actually want to keep your
muscles<00:00:54.390> relatively<00:00:55.020> tight<00:00:55.289> now<00:00:56.190> in<00:00:56.670> order<00:00:57.030> to

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
muscles relatively tight now in order to

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.639 
muscles relatively tight now in order to
have<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.629> good<00:00:57.899> warm-up<00:00:58.199> what<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.440> want<00:00:58.590> to

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
have a good warm-up what you want to

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.760 
have a good warm-up what you want to
focus<00:00:58.829> on<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.850> dynamic<00:01:00.719> stretching<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.440> like<00:01:01.649> I

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
focus on is dynamic stretching so like I

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.049 
focus on is dynamic stretching so like I
said<00:01:01.980> we're<00:01:02.129> just<00:01:02.160> warming<00:01:02.550> up<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.910> body

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
said we're just warming up the body

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.000 
said we're just warming up the body
warming<00:01:03.930> up<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.140> muscles<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.979> joints

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
warming up the muscles and the joints

warming up the muscles and the joints
what<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:05.970> want<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.270> do<00:01:06.360> after<00:01:07.020> training<00:01:07.320> is

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
what you want to do after training is

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.200 
what you want to do after training is
static<00:01:08.100> stretching<00:01:08.520> that's<00:01:08.640> when<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.000> want

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
static stretching that's when you want

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.820 
static stretching that's when you want
to<00:01:09.240> loosen<00:01:09.659> your<00:01:09.780> muscles<00:01:09.840> increase

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
to loosen your muscles increase

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.330 
to loosen your muscles increase
flexibility<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:12.200> reduce<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.470> tension<00:01:14.040> the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
flexibility and reduce the tension the

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.100 
flexibility and reduce the tension the
tightness<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:15.090> those<00:01:15.390> muscles<00:01:15.840> because

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
tightness in those muscles because

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.289 
tightness in those muscles because
that's<00:01:16.290> going<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.560> help<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.920> reduce<00:01:17.520> soreness
