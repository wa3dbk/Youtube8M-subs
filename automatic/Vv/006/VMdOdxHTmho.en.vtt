painters<00:00:56.129> tape<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.579> find<00:00:56.940> that's<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.210> best<00:00:57.480> I'm

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
painters tape I find that's the best I'm

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.410 
painters tape I find that's the best I'm
sure<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.320> could<00:00:58.469> use<00:00:58.820> masking<00:00:59.820> tape<00:00:59.879> I

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
sure you could use masking tape I

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.270 
sure you could use masking tape I
wouldn't<00:01:00.870> suggest<00:01:00.989> duct<00:01:01.500> tape<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:02.010> would<00:01:02.129> be

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
wouldn't suggest duct tape that would be

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.850 
wouldn't suggest duct tape that would be
too<00:01:02.460> much<00:01:02.609> scotch<00:01:03.120> tape<00:01:03.390> even<00:01:03.600> would<00:01:04.439> probably

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
too much scotch tape even would probably

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.890 
too much scotch tape even would probably
work<00:01:05.010> but<00:01:05.610> we<00:01:05.850> are<00:01:06.000> just<00:01:06.240> going<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.479> go<00:01:06.750> ahead

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
work but we are just going to go ahead

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.149 
work but we are just going to go ahead
and<00:01:07.409> cut<00:01:08.130> some<00:01:08.430> really<00:01:08.760> thin<00:01:09.500> lines<00:01:10.500> with<00:01:11.010> this

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
and cut some really thin lines with this

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:19.420 
and cut some really thin lines with this
tape<00:01:12.320> and<00:01:13.320> then<00:01:14.130> set<00:01:14.460> them<00:01:14.640> aside

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.070 

I'm<00:01:20.000> trying<00:01:20.270> to<00:01:20.330> make<00:01:20.420> them<00:01:20.540> as<00:01:20.630> even<00:01:20.960> as

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
I'm trying to make them as even as

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:27.040 
I'm trying to make them as even as
possible<00:01:24.520> and<00:01:25.520> I'm<00:01:25.700> gonna<00:01:25.790> go<00:01:26.030> in<00:01:26.450> a<00:01:26.630> diagonal

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
possible and I'm gonna go in a diagonal

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.670 
possible and I'm gonna go in a diagonal
fashion<00:01:27.410> across<00:01:27.830> my<00:01:28.100> thumb<00:01:28.430> so<00:01:29.270> I<00:01:29.720> would<00:01:30.470> just

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
fashion across my thumb so I would just

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.030 
fashion across my thumb so I would just
cut<00:01:30.980> maybe<00:01:32.380> seven<00:01:33.380> or<00:01:33.470> eight<00:01:33.710> of<00:01:33.740> these<00:01:34.750> as

cut maybe seven or eight of these as

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.950 
cut maybe seven or eight of these as
straight<00:01:37.040> as<00:01:37.250> you<00:01:37.280> can<00:01:37.460> and<00:01:40.479> the<00:01:41.479> great<00:01:41.780> thing
