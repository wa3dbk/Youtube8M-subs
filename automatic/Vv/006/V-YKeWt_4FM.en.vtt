biceps for the beach those guys are
pretty<00:01:31.710> much<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.950> waste<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.520> steroids<00:01:33.000> they're

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
pretty much a waste of steroids they're

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.109 
pretty much a waste of steroids they're
wasting<00:01:33.780> good<00:01:34.020> drugs<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.439> athletes<00:01:34.799> need<00:01:35.119> to

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
wasting good drugs and athletes need to

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.300 
wasting good drugs and athletes need to
compete<00:01:36.450> in<00:01:36.570> their<00:01:36.689> sports<00:01:37.070> but<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.100> don't

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
compete in their sports but I don't

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.350 
compete in their sports but I don't
believe<00:01:38.549> in<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.759> concept<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:39.210> natural

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
believe in the concept of natural

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.590 
believe in the concept of natural
athletes<00:01:39.900> at<00:01:39.990> all<00:01:41.119> so<00:01:42.119> I'm<00:01:42.270> sure<00:01:42.479> we'll

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
athletes at all so I'm sure we'll

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.090 
athletes at all so I'm sure we'll
disagree<00:01:43.020> on<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.320> but<00:01:43.530> when<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.649> comes<00:01:43.890> to

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
disagree on that but when it comes to

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.770 
disagree on that but when it comes to
training<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.880> think<00:01:46.850> you<00:01:47.850> guys<00:01:48.000> need<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.270> take<00:01:48.540> a

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
training I think you guys need to take a

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.440 
training I think you guys need to take a
bit<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.350> what<00:01:49.530> Leroy<00:01:49.920> Kolbert<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:51.000> saying

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
bit of what Leroy Kolbert is saying

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.609 
bit of what Leroy Kolbert is saying
seriously<00:01:52.320> here<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:53.430> reason<00:01:53.790> for<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.149> is<00:01:54.299> that

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
seriously here the reason for it is that

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.410 
seriously here the reason for it is that
the<00:01:55.619> guys<00:01:55.799> from<00:01:55.829> his<00:01:56.189> era<00:01:56.399> before<00:01:56.820> we<00:01:57.240> had<00:01:57.390> all

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
the guys from his era before we had all

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.940 
the guys from his era before we had all
these<00:01:57.659> drugs<00:01:57.960> available<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.560> even<00:01:58.649> they<00:01:58.860> have

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
these drugs available and even they have

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.649 
these drugs available and even they have
the<00:01:59.070> only<00:01:59.399> drugs<00:01:59.759> that<00:01:59.939> were<00:02:00.060> available<00:02:00.329> in

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659

full-body<00:04:19.090> and<00:04:19.739> his<00:04:20.739> results<00:04:21.099> were<00:04:21.340> pretty

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
full-body and his results were pretty

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.060 
full-body and his results were pretty
impressive<00:04:22.430> and<00:04:23.440> most<00:04:24.440> of<00:04:24.590> the<00:04:24.650> guys<00:04:24.800> who

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
impressive and most of the guys who

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.950 
impressive and most of the guys who
trained<00:04:25.400> that<00:04:25.610> way<00:04:25.670> in<00:04:25.820> his<00:04:26.000> era<00:04:26.270> have<00:04:26.600> better

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
trained that way in his era have better

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.070 
trained that way in his era have better
physiques<00:04:27.470> than<00:04:27.800> most<00:04:28.310> guys<00:04:29.000> you<00:04:29.600> know<00:04:29.840> right

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
physiques than most guys you know right

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.220 
physiques than most guys you know right
now<00:04:30.260> use<00:04:30.860> a<00:04:30.890> little<00:04:31.190> bit<00:04:31.250> of<00:04:31.310> steroids<00:04:32.230> before

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
now use a little bit of steroids before

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
now use a little bit of steroids before
steroids<00:04:33.920> are<00:04:34.100> even<00:04:34.310> around<00:04:34.630> and<00:04:36.010> I<00:04:37.010> think

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
steroids are even around and I think

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.040 
steroids are even around and I think
that's<00:04:37.400> a<00:04:37.490> large<00:04:37.700> part<00:04:38.000> so<00:04:38.300> they<00:04:38.450> due<00:04:38.810> to<00:04:38.960> the

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
that's a large part so they due to the

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.750 
that's a large part so they due to the
fact<00:04:39.290> that<00:04:39.410> they're<00:04:39.620> training<00:04:40.070> with<00:04:40.220> superior

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
fact that they're training with superior

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.000 
fact that they're training with superior
to<00:04:40.910> the<00:04:41.060> splits<00:04:41.480> that<00:04:41.570> people<00:04:41.900> are<00:04:42.050> doing<00:04:42.200> who

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
to the splits that people are doing who

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.100 
to the splits that people are doing who
are<00:04:43.130> not<00:04:43.430> on<00:04:43.670> very<00:04:44.120> large<00:04:44.330> amounts<00:04:44.750> of<00:04:44.810> drugs

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
are not on very large amounts of drugs

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.740 
are not on very large amounts of drugs
in<00:04:45.410> order<00:04:45.650> to<00:04:45.800> really<00:04:46.040> make<00:04:46.130> a<00:04:46.310> split<00:04:47.090> program

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
in order to really make a split program

in order to really make a split program
work<00:04:47.960> optimally<00:04:48.310> you<00:04:49.310> do<00:04:49.550> need<00:04:49.730> a<00:04:49.760> fairly

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
work optimally you do need a fairly

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.270 
work optimally you do need a fairly
large<00:04:50.540> amount<00:04:50.750> of<00:04:51.020> drugs<00:04:51.320> not<00:04:51.740> just<00:04:51.980> a<00:04:52.070> little

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
large amount of drugs not just a little

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.300 
large amount of drugs not just a little
bit<00:04:52.490> so<00:04:53.150> this<00:04:53.420> is<00:04:53.630> a<00:04:53.660> guy<00:04:53.900> who<00:04:53.960> did<00:04:54.470> it<00:04:54.500> he<00:04:55.100> went

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
bit so this is a guy who did it he went

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.070 
bit so this is a guy who did it he went
through<00:04:55.490> it<00:04:55.580> himself<00:04:55.760> he<00:04:56.270> knew<00:04:56.570> all<00:04:56.810> of<00:04:56.840> the

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
through it himself he knew all of the

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.900 
through it himself he knew all of the
top<00:04:57.290> guys<00:04:57.530> back<00:04:57.890> in<00:04:57.920> his<00:04:58.190> day<00:04:58.400> he<00:04:58.430> knew<00:04:58.730> how

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
top guys back in his day he knew how

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.990 
top guys back in his day he knew how
they<00:04:59.060> trained<00:04:59.950> the<00:05:00.950> experiment<00:05:01.550> with<00:05:01.640> his<00:05:01.850> own

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
they trained the experiment with his own

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.400 
they trained the experiment with his own
training<00:05:02.270> and<00:05:02.540> had<00:05:02.690> one<00:05:02.960> of<00:05:03.020> the<00:05:03.110> most

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
training and had one of the most

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.380 
training and had one of the most
impressive<00:05:03.800> physiques<00:05:04.400> of<00:05:04.520> his<00:05:04.670> era<00:05:04.940> and<00:05:05.240> that

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.390 
impressive physiques of his era and that

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.380 
impressive physiques of his era and that
is<00:05:05.570> how<00:05:05.720> he<00:05:05.780> trained<00:05:06.320> and<00:05:07.040> he<00:05:07.790> is<00:05:07.910> telling<00:05:08.270> you

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390 
is how he trained and he is telling you

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:09.820 
is how he trained and he is telling you
the<00:05:08.510> same<00:05:08.750> thing<00:05:08.930> that<00:05:09.050> I'm<00:05:09.230> telling<00:05:09.470> you<00:05:09.740> in

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
the same thing that I'm telling you in

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.020 
the same thing that I'm telling you in
the<00:05:09.950> same<00:05:10.130> thing<00:05:10.340> that<00:05:10.430> I'm<00:05:10.580> telling<00:05:10.910> you

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
the same thing that I'm telling you

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.000 
the same thing that I'm telling you
based<00:05:11.240> upon<00:05:11.510> the<00:05:11.660> scientific<00:05:11.990> research<00:05:12.530> we

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010 
based upon the scientific research we

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.400 
based upon the scientific research we
have<00:05:13.220> today<00:05:13.840> showing<00:05:14.840> that<00:05:14.960> this<00:05:15.170> type<00:05:15.380> of

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.410 
have today showing that this type of

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.800 
have today showing that this type of
training<00:05:15.860> is<00:05:16.280> going<00:05:16.700> to<00:05:16.820> be<00:05:17.000> superior<00:05:17.450> for

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
training is going to be superior for

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.040 
training is going to be superior for
most<00:05:17.990> people<00:05:18.380> who<00:05:18.440> aren't<00:05:18.650> on<00:05:18.860> drugs<00:05:19.190> so

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
most people who aren't on drugs so

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.320 
most people who aren't on drugs so
you've<00:05:21.050> got<00:05:21.320> old<00:05:22.190> guys<00:05:22.490> like<00:05:22.700> him<00:05:22.970> with<00:05:23.120> all

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
you've got old guys like him with all

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.270 
you've got old guys like him with all
the<00:05:23.780> experience<00:05:24.350> in<00:05:24.470> the<00:05:24.560> world<00:05:24.740> telling<00:05:25.160> you

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
the experience in the world telling you

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.220 
the experience in the world telling you
this<00:05:25.460> and<00:05:25.670> then<00:05:25.760> you<00:05:25.880> have<00:05:26.060> science<00:05:26.690> guys<00:05:26.900> like

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:27.230 
this and then you have science guys like

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.700 
this and then you have science guys like
me<00:05:27.440> telling<00:05:27.710> you<00:05:27.950> the<00:05:28.070> same<00:05:28.280> thing<00:05:28.550> today<00:05:28.790> so

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
me telling you the same thing today so

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.020 
me telling you the same thing today so
why<00:05:30.710> people<00:05:31.100> don't<00:05:31.250> get<00:05:31.640> it

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.030 
why people don't get it

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.380 
why people don't get it
I<00:05:32.530> just<00:05:33.530> don't<00:05:33.710> know<00:05:34.090> because<00:05:35.090> you<00:05:35.240> have

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.390 
I just don't know because you have

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:36.670 
I just don't know because you have
people<00:05:35.750> on<00:05:35.870> both<00:05:36.170> ends<00:05:36.380> of<00:05:36.440> the<00:05:36.560> spectrum

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
people on both ends of the spectrum

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.720 
people on both ends of the spectrum
telling<00:05:37.400> you<00:05:37.580> this<00:05:38.020> and<00:05:39.160> I<00:05:40.160> simply<00:05:40.550> don't

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:40.730 
telling you this and I simply don't

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:42.310 
telling you this and I simply don't
understand<00:05:41.210> why<00:05:41.330> at<00:05:41.480> this<00:05:41.630> point<00:05:41.930> when<00:05:42.200> you

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 
understand why at this point when you

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.350 
understand why at this point when you
have<00:05:42.530> guys<00:05:42.740> like<00:05:42.800> Leroy<00:05:43.370> coming<00:05:43.970> from<00:05:44.150> back

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
have guys like Leroy coming from back

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.300 
have guys like Leroy coming from back
then<00:05:44.600> with<00:05:44.810> all<00:05:45.050> of<00:05:45.410> those<00:05:45.560> decades<00:05:46.130> and

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310 
then with all of those decades and

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.890 
then with all of those decades and
decades<00:05:46.460> of<00:05:46.760> experience<00:05:46.910> are<00:05:48.880> agreeing<00:05:49.900> with

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900 
decades of experience are agreeing with

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.870 
decades of experience are agreeing with
all<00:05:51.170> the<00:05:51.440> modern<00:05:51.650> science<00:05:52.190> guys<00:05:52.400> and<00:05:52.700> we're

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
all the modern science guys and we're

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.670 
all the modern science guys and we're
saying<00:05:53.240> the<00:05:53.480> exact<00:05:53.870> same<00:05:53.900> thing<00:05:54.470> that<00:05:54.620> our

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
saying the exact same thing that our

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.590 
saying the exact same thing that our
scientific<00:05:55.400> evidence<00:05:55.790> is<00:05:55.970> saying<00:05:56.210> this<00:05:56.420> stuff

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:56.600 
scientific evidence is saying this stuff

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.120 
scientific evidence is saying this stuff
that<00:05:56.780> they<00:05:56.870> figured<00:05:57.080> out<00:05:57.290> decades<00:05:57.710> ago<00:05:57.950> is

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.130 
that they figured out decades ago is

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.870 
that they figured out decades ago is
actually<00:05:58.610> right<00:05:59.440> and<00:06:00.440> they<00:06:01.160> actually<00:06:01.670> had<00:06:01.850> it

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:01.880 
actually right and they actually had it

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.030 
actually right and they actually had it
right<00:06:02.240> back<00:06:02.570> then<00:06:03.020> people<00:06:03.350> have<00:06:03.620> pretty<00:06:03.830> much

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:04.040 
right back then people have pretty much

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.910 
right back then people have pretty much
screwed<00:06:04.460> it<00:06:04.610> up<00:06:04.730> after<00:06:05.090> that<00:06:05.500> why<00:06:06.500> people

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:06.920 
screwed it up after that why people

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.130 
screwed it up after that why people
don't<00:06:07.100> get<00:06:07.430> that<00:06:07.700> and<00:06:08.090> why<00:06:08.540> they<00:06:08.720> don't<00:06:08.840> seem

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:09.140 
don't get that and why they don't seem

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:10.930 
don't get that and why they don't seem
to<00:06:09.590> make<00:06:09.800> that<00:06:10.010> connection<00:06:10.280> between<00:06:10.490> the<00:06:10.790> two

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:10.940 
to make that connection between the two

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.600 
to make that connection between the two
is<00:06:11.300> just<00:06:11.510> beyond<00:06:11.810> me<00:06:12.020> but<00:06:12.860> go<00:06:13.130> check<00:06:13.190> it<00:06:13.490> out

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
is just beyond me but go check it out

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:14.800 
is just beyond me but go check it out
and<00:06:13.850> like<00:06:13.910> I<00:06:14.060> said<00:06:14.120> I<00:06:14.330> don't<00:06:14.390> always<00:06:14.600> agree

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
and like I said I don't always agree

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.990 
and like I said I don't always agree
with<00:06:14.960> everything<00:06:15.350> that<00:06:15.770> mr.<00:06:16.130> Kohlberg<00:06:16.670> says

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 
with everything that mr. Kohlberg says

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.150 
with everything that mr. Kohlberg says
but<00:06:17.300> I<00:06:17.330> do<00:06:17.450> agree<00:06:17.780> with<00:06:17.960> a<00:06:18.110> fair<00:06:18.500> amount<00:06:18.530> of<00:06:18.980> it

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 
but I do agree with a fair amount of it

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.610 
but I do agree with a fair amount of it
and<00:06:19.280> I<00:06:19.340> think<00:06:19.400> this<00:06:19.730> particular<00:06:19.880> video<00:06:20.420> is<00:06:20.900> one

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:21.620 
and I think this particular video is one

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.590 
and I think this particular video is one
of<00:06:21.710> those<00:06:21.860> two<00:06:22.010> where<00:06:22.190> I<00:06:22.430> probably<00:06:22.820> agree<00:06:23.300> with

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:23.600 
of those two where I probably agree with

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.439 
of those two where I probably agree with
about<00:06:23.870> 90

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:24.449 
about 90

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:27.140 
about 90
what<00:06:24.900> he<00:06:24.990> said<00:06:25.169> in<00:06:25.259> that<00:06:25.379> video<00:06:25.559> and<00:06:25.949> all<00:06:26.849> of<00:06:26.999> my

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.150 
what he said in that video and all of my

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.299 
what he said in that video and all of my
understanding<00:06:27.449> of<00:06:28.080> sports<00:06:28.499> physiology<00:06:29.159> and

00:06:29.299 --> 00:06:29.309 
understanding of sports physiology and

00:06:29.309 --> 00:06:31.879 
understanding of sports physiology and
Exercise<00:06:29.759> Science<00:06:30.330> actually<00:06:31.259> agrees<00:06:31.650> with

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:31.889 
Exercise Science actually agrees with

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:33.649 
Exercise Science actually agrees with
what<00:06:32.069> he<00:06:32.189> says<00:06:32.430> in<00:06:32.580> that<00:06:32.639> video<00:06:33.089> he<00:06:33.389> has<00:06:33.509> it

00:06:33.649 --> 00:06:33.659 
what he says in that video he has it

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:36.350 
what he says in that video he has it
pretty<00:06:34.080> accurate<00:06:34.650> and<00:06:34.860> he's<00:06:35.520> actually<00:06:35.999> giving

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 
pretty accurate and he's actually giving

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.309 
pretty accurate and he's actually giving
it<00:06:36.659> to<00:06:36.809> you<00:06:36.960> from<00:06:37.229> his<00:06:37.439> real<00:06:37.710> world<00:06:37.889> experience

00:06:39.309 --> 00:06:39.319 
it to you from his real world experience

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:41.540 
it to you from his real world experience
all<00:06:40.319> right<00:06:40.439> yes<00:06:40.559> that's<00:06:40.830> really<00:06:41.069> all<00:06:41.309> I<00:06:41.339> have

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:41.550 
all right yes that's really all I have

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:42.980 
all right yes that's really all I have
to<00:06:41.669> say<00:06:41.699> on<00:06:41.969> that<00:06:42.089> today<00:06:42.330> I<00:06:42.360> hope<00:06:42.599> it's<00:06:42.839> been

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:42.990 
to say on that today I hope it's been

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.260 
to say on that today I hope it's been
informative<00:06:43.139> and<00:06:43.919> I<00:06:44.279> will<00:06:44.490> talk<00:06:44.669> to<00:06:44.699> you<00:06:44.969> next
