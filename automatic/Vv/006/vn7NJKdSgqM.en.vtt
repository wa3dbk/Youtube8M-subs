00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
difference I'm going to show you how I

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.850 
difference I'm going to show you how I
knew<00:00:35.190> that<00:00:35.219> right<00:00:35.610> now<00:00:35.899> obviously<00:00:36.899> first<00:00:37.649> of

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
knew that right now obviously first of

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
all you have to boil an egg and then you

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.970 
all you have to boil an egg and then you
have<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:40.980> shell<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:42.170> and<00:00:43.170> then<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:43.559> cut<00:00:43.829> it

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
have to shell it and then you cut it

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.720 
have to shell it and then you cut it
open<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:45.950> you<00:00:46.950> take<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.730> middle<00:00:48.210> out<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.390> it

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
open and you take the middle out of it

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.299 
open and you take the middle out of it
now<00:00:50.730> this<00:00:50.910> part<00:00:51.210> right<00:00:51.300> here<00:00:52.070> that's<00:00:53.070> where

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
now this part right here that's where

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.310 
now this part right here that's where
the<00:00:53.460> cholesterol<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.329> if<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:54.930> get<00:00:55.050> rid<00:00:55.260> of

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
the cholesterol that if you get rid of

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.229 
the cholesterol that if you get rid of
that<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.949> get<00:00:56.100> rid<00:00:56.219> of<00:00:56.340> cholesterol<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.180> I

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
that you get rid of cholesterol so I

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.790 
that you get rid of cholesterol so I
just<00:00:57.449> throw<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:58.020> away<00:00:58.199> now<00:01:00.410> you<00:01:01.410> might<00:01:01.620> be

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
just throw that away now you might be

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.380
