00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:07.140
 the montini middle school operated one 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.990
 choice in favor of his students more 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.480
 disadvantaged learned some initiatives 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.309
 which, though modest, take on importance in 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.080
 this environment 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.779
 middle school teachers visit 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.980
 periodically the fifth grade 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.230
 they want to meet their future students 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.810
 and realize the problems that 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.640
 will face next year 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.800
 an attempt is therefore made to bridge the gap between 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.539
 elementary and medium which constitutes 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.050
 still one of the most serious shortcomings of the 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.050
 compulsory education 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.379
 we are used to every topic that 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.829
 let's make a discussion 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:48.399
 this will not be allowed to doctors 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.739
 indeed we believe we are also 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.440
 at middle and elementary level this is one 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.739
 fundamental tool selling the 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.970
 discussion to set everything up 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:59.829
 our teaching 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.239
 because it is right through the 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.320
 discussion that we can grasp 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.560
 the child's profound motivations 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.440
 weeps 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:13.200
 we must grasp say imposed 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:16.979
 interests related to those reasons they have 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.390
 the debate aroused the debate 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:23.050
 indispensable for us 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.929
 indeed they will not always develop ahead 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.270
 the teacher when they told us when we 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:30.729
 we answer however also if we answer 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.580
 having made a mistake is nothing but us 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.500
 it appears telephone even with 33 cohabit 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.140
 what you made your master the 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.470
 merit brought us from the first up 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.960
 the fifth also pupils that 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.280
 ok i would like to know blood in the first one 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.280
 average bucciano move 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.830
 to have a glossy 12 outdoors seats 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.570
 rather 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:00.610
 from the preview but rather with 5 6 boys and 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.270
 to judge from what we have 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.670
 given the shores of their possibilities 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.840
 middle school must be a little 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.910
 hard 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.610
 in the beginning because my sister has me 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:16.630
 spoken very religiously found 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.550
 rather disadvantaged perhaps the same 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.090
 what will happen years 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.520
 however since there are many 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:28.270
 professors talking about them 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:31.750
 matter to be able then others come 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:34.480
 professors talking about another 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.880
 matter were completely different must 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.530
 be a little difficult at the beginning and if 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.940
 one does not get used to it 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.600
 we believe that it is valid to bring 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.550
 boys up to middle school 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:52.990
 therefore avoid repetition wide 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:55.780
 otenza experiences made and ineffective the 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.610
 boy becomes a misfit who does 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.400
 will repeat before the first but need the 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:05.200
 second the second is there that 20 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:07.810
 the worst in school are there for zero 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:13.989
 promoted I had to go to the mondini 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:14.830
 because there were heirloom cuts from 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:19.090
 do 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:23.290
 and then there was the neighbor and those of the 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:25.769
 first media could go to me 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.769
 like to notice 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.590
 I understand but I see the school shared 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:49.830
 he is fine he said 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:51.630
 that there is the after-school where one does 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:55.850
 school from 3 to 5 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.850
 so it would be good to go there 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.180
 the school tries above all to go 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.159
 meeting the most basic needs of the 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.959
 guys like that of a place where 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:12.890
 to get together so as not to be forced to 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.890
 play in the middle of the street 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.139
 what matters is that the school has 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.510
 radically changed attitude in the 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:26.310
 towards his boys the 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.530
 almost sacred institution where it is 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.210
 distributes knowledge has transformed 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.340
 in a real public service 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.580
 she made herself available to her 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.580
 students 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.560
 from 7 am to 5 pm 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:44.090
 afternoon the boys can enter 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.580
 freely in the school premises 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.770
 as well as for the elections to stay 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.530
 together to play or to study in 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.539
 recovery classes found in the school 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.430
 their cultural and life center 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:57.020
 Community 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.520
 in this way the montini school is 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.740
 succeeded in getting her students 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:05.169
 they go willingly to school and above all 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.169
 feel a real interest in the study
