that<00:01:36.960> review<00:01:37.439> is<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.680> actual<00:01:37.979> layer<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.549> the

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
that review is the actual layer of the

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.039 
that review is the actual layer of the
film<00:01:39.259> so<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:41.329> decided<00:01:42.329> not<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.659> put<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:42.930> on

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
film so I decided not to put it on

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.359 
film so I decided not to put it on
because<00:01:43.729> it<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.869> fingerprint<00:01:46.500> magnet<00:01:47.040> and

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
because it is a fingerprint magnet and

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.010 
because it is a fingerprint magnet and
it<00:01:47.520> gets<00:01:47.939> grease<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.420> all<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.689> I<00:01:48.810> don't

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
it gets grease and all that I don't

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.240 
it gets grease and all that I don't
really<00:01:49.140> like<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:49.710> that's<00:01:49.829> why<00:01:50.040> i<00:01:50.070> picked

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
really like that so that's why i picked

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.649 
really like that so that's why i picked

kid itself as you can see let me use
reflection<00:02:15.709> there<00:02:15.950> go<00:02:16.099> you<00:02:16.400> can't<00:02:16.640> really<00:02:16.760> see

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
reflection there go you can't really see

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:18.520 
reflection there go you can't really see
that<00:02:17.269> there's<00:02:17.480> a<00:02:17.569> film<00:02:17.840> on<00:02:17.989> there<00:02:18.170> but<00:02:18.379> there

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
that there's a film on there but there

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.820 
that there's a film on there but there
is<00:02:18.739> there's<00:02:19.610> a<00:02:19.849> little<00:02:20.720> bit<00:02:20.959> of<00:02:21.019> grease<00:02:21.290> but<00:02:21.590> to

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
is there's a little bit of grease but to

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.820 
is there's a little bit of grease but to
me<00:02:21.980> nuts<00:02:22.220> that's<00:02:22.400> nothing<00:02:22.790> at<00:02:22.910> all<00:02:23.200> I'm<00:02:24.200> used

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
me nuts that's nothing at all I'm used

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.530 
me nuts that's nothing at all I'm used
to<00:02:24.950> that<00:02:25.129> definitely<00:02:25.790> on<00:02:25.910> the<00:02:26.030> phone<00:02:26.269> because

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
to that definitely on the phone because

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.410 
to that definitely on the phone because
it<00:02:26.780> wipes<00:02:26.959> away<00:02:27.140> pretty<00:02:27.470> well<00:02:28.180> we<00:02:29.180> get<00:02:29.390> a

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
it wipes away pretty well we get a

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.199 
it wipes away pretty well we get a
different<00:02:29.810> angle<00:02:30.110> as<00:02:30.170> well<00:02:31.540> so<00:02:34.209> fingerprints

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
different angle as well so fingerprints

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.539 
different angle as well so fingerprints
are<00:02:35.420> not<00:02:36.819> really<00:02:37.819> an<00:02:37.910> issue<00:02:38.150> on<00:02:38.420> here<00:02:39.430> if<00:02:40.430> you

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
are not really an issue on here if you

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.979 
are not really an issue on here if you
can<00:02:40.670> see<00:02:40.700> just<00:02:41.060> kind<00:02:41.330> of<00:02:41.360> wipes<00:02:41.599> right<00:02:41.810> off<00:02:42.489> so

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
can see just kind of wipes right off so

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.270 
can see just kind of wipes right off so
definitely<00:02:44.989> good<00:02:45.140> film<00:02:45.410> recommended<00:02:45.980> I<00:02:46.099> mean

definitely good film recommended I mean
it's<00:02:46.430> not<00:02:46.519> going<00:02:46.700> to<00:02:46.760> prevent<00:02:46.910> it<00:02:47.120> from

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
it's not going to prevent it from

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.110 
it's not going to prevent it from
cracking<00:02:47.390> if<00:02:47.840> you<00:02:48.280> drop<00:02:49.280> it<00:02:49.430> or<00:02:49.519> whatnot<00:02:49.700> but

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
cracking if you drop it or whatnot but

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.199 
cracking if you drop it or whatnot but

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
sort of a 3m with us carbon fiber design

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.309 
sort of a 3m with us carbon fiber design
the<00:03:13.069> only<00:03:13.519> one<00:03:13.700> that<00:03:13.910> has<00:03:14.209> the<00:03:14.239> oval<00:03:14.930> cut<00:03:15.139> out

of a flash error so with this it's a

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:23.430 
of a flash error so with this it's a
tear<00:03:19.880> drop<00:03:20.060> design<00:03:20.510> as<00:03:21.170> you<00:03:21.350> can<00:03:21.440> see<00:03:21.769> and

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
tear drop design as you can see and

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.539 
tear drop design as you can see and
taking<00:03:24.440> the<00:03:24.500> pictures<00:03:24.799> there's<00:03:25.069> no<00:03:25.190> issues<00:03:25.519> at

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549

piece but it's really thin piece of
protection<00:03:36.079> on<00:03:36.170> the<00:03:36.319> phone<00:03:36.500> itself<00:03:36.889> so<00:03:37.840> the

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
protection on the phone itself so the

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.050 
protection on the phone itself so the

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.009 
picked it up from it's a stealth armor
side<00:03:55.310> pieces<00:03:55.639> I<00:03:55.849> actually<00:03:56.090> took<00:03:56.480> my<00:03:56.750> style

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
side pieces I actually took my style

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:59.199 
side pieces I actually took my style
farmer<00:03:57.349> off<00:03:57.500> and<00:03:57.769> then<00:03:57.889> left<00:03:58.400> side<00:03:58.730> pieces<00:03:58.970> on

just<00:03:59.540> in<00:03:59.660> case<00:03:59.690> and<00:04:00.639> but<00:04:01.639> basically<00:04:01.970> that's

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
just in case and but basically that's

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.789 
just in case and but basically that's
pretty<00:04:02.420> much<00:04:02.510> it<00:04:02.569> so<00:04:03.139> just<00:04:03.500> want<00:04:03.650> to<00:04:03.709> share

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
Apple has that case so but one last

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.870 
Apple has that case so but one last
thing<00:04:13.370> on<00:04:13.549> the<00:04:13.639> show<00:04:13.700> is<00:04:14.090> clarity<00:04:15.609> clarity<00:04:16.609> is
