00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:09.049
 good the bike is made up a lot 

00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:11.910
 of pieces that can be disassembled 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:13.559
 whole as they go 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.510
 and wearing out they can change 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.490
 improving the bike the weight and the 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.759
 good performance we start with the 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:25.580
 fundamental handlebar this is a measure 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:25.580
 of 9 with short window 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.630
 the Rings 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.090
 of the bike are fit 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:37.210
 double wall this here are the 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:40.629
 Bushings the rear and the front 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:43.430
 they oscillate between the price of about 100 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.410
 up to 300 euros 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.920
 the forward is usually thinner so 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.609
 roll better 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.789
 the fundamental picture is also brand 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:53.789
 fit 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:05.010
 his weight is from Vicente was his weight is 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:06.980
 9 700 this is called cranks which is what 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.970
 that the pedals the aluminum pedals 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:13.789
 with aluminum studs also from the 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.050
 power 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:19.990
 from to lift 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:23.410
 the direction that makes us turn the bike 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.930
 for the two sides a little more the pg 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.890
 what are we offering and can we 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.890
 make fly 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.510
 this is called bushing covers is for 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.660
 protect the bushings when you provide 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:41.840
 and we will always carry a small plate of 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.450
 25 and back a driver of 9 so that it 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.130
 make us shorter pedals and not us 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.860
 we have to kill when climbing a ramp 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:53.430
 Nothing like that 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.430
 the saddle is pivotal you know have option 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.700
 of posture and little else is made up of the 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.700
 bike
