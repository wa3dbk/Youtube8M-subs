 we are going to cut the meat in 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:56.900
 little squares flying so 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.900
 small you see 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.460
 when the pan is hot with a 

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:03.770
 oil droplet let's add the 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.630
 leek 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.630
 bought in tiny parts 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.200
 when it's a bit golden, we take it out 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.020
 the achiote 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.109
 A) Yes 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:23.530
 if we start mixing everything 

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:26.530
 Now let's add a teaspoon of 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.530
 Butter 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.340
 we are going to fold the meat now with garlic 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.820
 We are cutting the garlic in very 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.280
 little girls 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.700
 then we throw a little bit of 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.700
 cumin 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.600
 and there's no way 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.340
 All these products are sold in 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.550
 Latino stores for people who do not 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.550
 know 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.510
 and the salts to taste finally 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.390
 when we have already mixed everything we leave 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.650
 about 10 to 15 minutes that concentrates the 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.829
 taste 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.319
 finally when you have already pregnant 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:25.349
 the 15 minutes we throw the Peruvian chili 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.349
 this is so that it takes color the meat 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:32.520
 to the potato when she is crushed 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:35.370
 let's add a food coloring 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:39.530
 and the butter 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.530
 and all that we mix well with the hand 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.660
 now let's add the sofrito of the 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.880
 onion 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:51.520
 to the potato 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.520
 and then we add the cheese 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.190
 we are mixing all that well 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.040
 Now we are taking and making balls 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.340
 and crushing them a little bit so that 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.629
 remain in the form of an omelet 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.629
 and they should be like this 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.730
 when the pan is hot 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:16.310
 let's take a drop of oil to 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.310
 fry our tortillas 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.690
 this is back and forth when you see that 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:26.090
 you start to brown you give the bottle 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.820
 the potatoes should look that golden 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.600
 so it counts equally half a minute 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.520
 one minute 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.430
 now as we have finished with the 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:38.870
 potato let's continue with the meat let's go 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.870
 to put a jet of oil 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:47.900
 and let it warm up 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.900
 let's add the meat 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.390
 now we take the laurel out of boxes and go 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.490
 to let that kidnap in the 15 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.700
 minutes when the meat and this is for 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:09.670

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.530

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.530
