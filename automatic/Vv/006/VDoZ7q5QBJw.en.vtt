00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 Good day and welcome to 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.810
 basic tutorials today i will give you 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.090
 Show her like a teamspeak 3 server 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.820
 installed on a windows computer 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.139
 that can be your own example 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.809
 be computer or even a windows 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.880
 server first we have to do that 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.910
 download teamspeak 3 server version 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.230
 we find them on the teamspeak page 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.430
 just teamspeak google the second one 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.800
 result is directly already the 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.199
 download page and there we invite in 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.990
 server down so i load up now 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.570
 the server 64 bit version down if 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.370
 you still have a 32 bit version loading 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.390
 you simply the 32 bit version down 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.870
 so once here on download degree and 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.700
 fidgets and order a newsletter 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.950
 So just continue to download and 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.469
 then click here and it will be the 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.879
 downloaded file 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.559
 So I did that because mine 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.219
 internet as you may already 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.350
 it's pretty slow in the download 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.059
 folder I have here so now 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.739
 you do not have to install anything 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.860
 pull the folder where you have it 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.890
 I just wanted to close that again 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.860
 here and in the folder rank so now 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.680
 you see here ts 3 server underlined 64 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.000
 Just click on the pixel and you're done 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.939
 your server will be started 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.130
 so now here is displayed directly 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.540
 login name server breathe and that 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.420
 associated password 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.430
 this is your server query admin account 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.100
 for example a web interface 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.500
 to use and then you can see here 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.000
 a server admin token you have to 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.610
 use if you now with the 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.619
 teamspeak 3 server server connects like this 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.490
 just open teamspeak 3 client 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.290
 connect 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.770
 Now, the server address here is the 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.939
 127 point 0.00 1 1 given 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.049
 this is your local server with local 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:52.409
 computer so you can also localhost 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.840
 for example, enter and then you come 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.060
 just stop it then other people then 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.070
 come on teamspeak server 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.020
 Of course they have to be yours 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.930
 public ip would need to know then 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.640
 for example googling for my ip and 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.860
 then there will be several strings where 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.330
 you get the displayed so I 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.700
 Just connect me here with the 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.110
 server and then here the 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.920
 enter the authorization key 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:20.520
 As you can see that is the server you can 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.380
 simply copy and press ok 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.720
 and you are already breathing on the server 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.750
 can edit everything as you like it 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.050
 I do not have a license for this now 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.490
 server means i can only have 32 clients 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.560
 leave here on the server 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.320
 that was enough for normal use 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.890
 also off and then if you have a license 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:43.440
 either he needs a npl so 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.690
 nonprofit license or otherwise stop 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.350
 something there are some 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:52.140
 license models yes I hope you have that 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.270
 you liked tutorial and you are at 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.070
 next maybe also like this 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.690
 Of course we would be happy and up 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.690
 next time goodbye
