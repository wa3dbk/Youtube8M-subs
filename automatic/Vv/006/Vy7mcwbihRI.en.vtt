00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.380
 ATENA fireplace insert 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.900
 Welcome 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.160
 In today's episode, we would like to present to you 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.620
 effective and modern fireplace insert for the distribution of hot air 

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.460
 Let's take a closer look at the details 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.720
 The furnace chamber and ash tray drawer look as if they were embedded in a larger cartridge 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.220
 Well, maybe not exactly in the cartridge 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.000
 and in the chimney liner 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.680
 And what is a chimney box? 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.800
 The chimney cassette is primarily characterized by a rectangular solid 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.520
 lower sizes 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.060
 lack of a smoke pipe 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.760
 and the fact that it fits not only into new housings, but above all to existing fireplaces 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.320
 Okay, Łukasz, and tell me what these two blanks are for? 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.100
 These two end caps form a hot air distribution system 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.420
 We have not said that yet, but ATENA has just such an integrated one 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.440
 hot air distribution system 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 to understand it better 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.960
 it's worth coming back, just to the ash box you talked about earlier 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.680
 Ashpan 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.500
 includes two fans 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.560
 These two fans draw air from the room 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.160
 they press into the hearth 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.220
 there, the air is primarily warmed up 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.100
 then two holes through this system 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.020
 and 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.060
 using insulated wires 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.860
 it is distributed to other rooms 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.320
 Thanks to these applications 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.800
 we have a completely integrated and compatible system for the distribution of hot air 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.020
 ATENA combines innovation with practicality 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.920
 And what is this practicality about? 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.720
 We can pay attention here and look at the ash box 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.540
 and the method of its emptying 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.340
 Just lift the bottom part 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.980
 and take out the ash box 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.820
 you do not have to interfere in the cartridge in any way 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.560
 Okay, tell me 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.140
 what about the glass? 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.420
 You know, I would like her to always be clean 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.320
 ATENA has a clean glass system as standard 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.540
 using the upper and lower curtain is the sweep glass 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.260
 As a result, a very small amount of soot and ash is placed on the glass 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.980
 We also have a function here 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.500
 afterburning of gases 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.360
 thanks to which it meets the tightened and restrictive European requirements in terms of emissions 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.300
 ATENA has a modern design, thanks to its steel construction 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.640
 The appearance and dimensions of the door without additional decorative elements 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.040
 they make it suits various types of interior decorations and fireplaces 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.400
 The Acumotte liner completes it 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.780
 Thank you for your attention
