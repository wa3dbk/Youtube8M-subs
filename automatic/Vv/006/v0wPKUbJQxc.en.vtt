00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.410
Hi everyone ! Today you're on my 2nd video of the content creator on GTA V Online.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.680
In a comment, someone ask me how did I create the wall from the race "Hot Wheels 2".

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.850
So I'm going to show you how did I build it, then I'll explain how to place containers in different ways.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.030
You have to begin with a large ramp, be sure to align it.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:37.370
I'm going to speed up the video because I already made a tutorial about placing the ramps.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.040
We're going to use the guide sign.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.670
We're going to place the ramp.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.970
Here.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.710
We stops at this height.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:01:01.220
At this point, you can place the container, not before... otherwise it will be difficult.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:07.400
So do it as I show you.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:16.270
Place the container and finish with the guide sign to finalize the ramp.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:26.750
Of course, to place containers, you have to use the money item or the bag of cement.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:33.720
You just have to move the cursor on the top left menu then come back quickly and press the A button.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:42.260
I'm going to show it to you. Place the ramp, take it back, look carefully on the top left menu

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:52.440
Choose the money item, go up in the menu. Press once the left button then the A button very quickly.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.050
Here, like this.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.220
Which is not bad for a race like my race "Infernal Containers".

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.790
Now, I'm going to show you how to build this construction.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:17.230
Place a large ramp, use the right joystick quickly.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.870
Here, the same except that I did the same thing on each side.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:33.150
It's really not bad for creating a race with your friends.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.390
Now, I'm going to show you how to do a large ramp with the containers.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.630
As you can see, I'm using the money but you can use the bag of cement.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:52.700
Place the cursor inside the container with the guide sign, place it correctly... like this.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:03:01.610
Then, take the container... take the money... look carefully, magic! ...Poof!

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.420
Here it is! Even if you see a gap, the cars are going up very well.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.920
So, don't worry about it.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.860
Then you have to continue, etc.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.530
I'm going to stop the creation of this big jump, but you can extend it if you want.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.240
So now, how to create a jump with the red containers or the green ones ?

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.880
I'm going to show you with the red ones, you have to use the right joystick...

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.720
You have to be very fast... Here.

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:53.130
You have to add a ramp because the containers are not in the ground.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.900
I'll show you how to do it next.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.900
Place a large ramp.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.470
Plus a small one over it.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.640
You can use the guide sign.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.320
You can use the red or green containers, but you have to put it in the ground correctly.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.590
You have to move back until it's well placed in the ground, like this.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.600
And now you have your ramp!

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:39.640
Now to create a construction, place the ramp like this, take it back by pressing the A button, then B button "back", it will put it back like this.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.750
Then place the container over it.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.180
So, really quickly with the right joystick, and here it is!

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.290
Then take back your two ramps.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:04.300
You're now at the end of this video, I hope that you liked this tutorial. Don't hesitate to ask questions by leaving a comment!
