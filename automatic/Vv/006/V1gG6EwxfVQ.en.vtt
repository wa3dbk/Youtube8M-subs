00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:14.620
 Hello, I came back earlier from my plan because I wanted to download Valentine's Day specials in January. 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.830
 The 3-element chocolate mousse is the first video. 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.520
 First, in a microwave safe bowl, add in 3 1/2 ounces of dark chocolate, 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.120
 كوب cup of whipped cream, 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.120
 And 8 large marshmallows. 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.220
 The Rocky Mountains used marshmallows 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.420
 It is mildly sweet Hershey dark chocolate especially today. 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.420
 Dark chocolate bread like Nestle Noir with 52% cocoa is fine for this recipe. 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.920
 Microwave for one minute. 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.920
 Make sure that you are using a container large enough for the marshmallows to rise. 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.720
 A little stirring on the almost combined. 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.720
 Then microwave for more than one minute 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.240
 Stirring until homogeneous mixed. 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.950
 Now whip كوب cup of whipped cream without sugar until thick. 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.740
 And pour 1/3 of the cream into a chilled chocolate mixture 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:42.660
 Fold on the combination. 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.650
 Then pour the rest of the whipped cream 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.450
 Even folds and homogeneous mixtures. 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.450
 In bread this is a good way to mix a light mixture and a thick mixture. 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:04.450
 ملعقة teaspoon pure vanilla extract is optional here. 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.480
 Voila, 3 ingredients chocolate mousse. 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.570
 Submit immediately 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.690
 Or chill in the fridge if you prefer a cool chocolate mousse. 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.990
 I love marshmallow chocolate mousse with cream, 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.580
 Chocolate shredded, 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.570
 And a small waffer on top. 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.900
 Bon appetite! 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.900
 This is the ultimate chocolate treat for your Valentine's Day. 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:48.210
 As you know it only takes 3 components and 20 minutes. 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.480
 Check out my recipes for Valentine's Day in my chocolate run. 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.480
 thanks for watching. Good-bye!
