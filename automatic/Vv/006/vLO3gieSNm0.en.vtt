Kakuta<00:04:22.550> I<00:04:23.090> think<00:04:23.450> if<00:04:23.570> I'm<00:04:23.690> right<00:04:23.840> the

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
Kakuta I think if I'm right the

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.080 
Kakuta I think if I'm right the
Frenchman<00:04:24.409> was<00:04:24.469> actually<00:04:24.800> our

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
Frenchman was actually our

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.610 
Frenchman was actually our
the<00:04:25.270> Spain<00:04:25.510> last<00:04:25.540> season<00:04:25.990> for<00:04:26.139> Rayo<00:04:26.350> Vallecano

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
the Spain last season for Rayo Vallecano

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.620 
the Spain last season for Rayo Vallecano
so<00:04:27.370> I<00:04:27.400> means<00:04:27.730> edgy<00:04:27.910> got<00:04:28.090> some<00:04:28.210> experience<00:04:28.449> in

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
so I means edgy got some experience in

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.300 
so I means edgy got some experience in
la<00:04:28.750> liga<00:04:28.930> didn't<00:04:29.530> actually<00:04:29.620> do<00:04:29.830> to<00:04:29.889> better

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
la liga didn't actually do to better

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.800 
la liga didn't actually do to better
than<00:04:30.520> terms<00:04:30.730> of<00:04:30.880> status<00:04:31.030> fun<00:04:31.270> right<00:04:31.449> but

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
than terms of status fun right but

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.750 
than terms of status fun right but

tribunal fees and I think the factory is
23<00:04:37.690> years<00:04:37.900> older<00:04:38.199> so<00:04:38.229> I<00:04:38.410> mean<00:04:38.650> upset<00:04:39.010> to<00:04:39.100> pay

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:49.479 
James McClean during West Brom the

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:51.390 
James McClean during West Brom the
second<00:05:49.870> day<00:05:50.020> would<00:05:50.590> form<00:05:50.860> a<00:05:50.919> wigger<00:05:51.130> man

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.210 
think McMahon was the last one but
McLean<00:05:55.419> a<00:05:55.450> son<00:05:55.720> for<00:05:55.840> 1.5<00:05:56.440> million<00:05:56.740> pounds<00:05:57.039> and
