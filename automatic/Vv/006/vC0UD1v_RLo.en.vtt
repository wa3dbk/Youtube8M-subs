00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:05.920
 we go with the best images of 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.320
 commitment led by david morals 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.570
 that ran well not the only good mistake 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.550
 it was also a product of an assistant and he 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.530
 you have to pay attention of course to 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.209
 line judge voice at all times was 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.269
 the one who commanded the attacks in this 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:22.599
 commitment arriving with ball stopped 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:25.329
 with elaboration with plays with shots 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:27.189
 of medium distance like this one of Carlos 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:28.689
 Ã­smodes that happens to near the arch of 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.970
 mosquera that were the protagonists of 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.569
 this commitment and guilty that the 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.569
 goal has not arrived 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.890
 in advance, he also played with 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.180
 many changes of orientation to 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.469
 backs of sport markers 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.210
 Ancash finding the spaces 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:45.879
 necessary but not defining 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.760
 adequately in this opportunity I was going to 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.609
 take 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.460
 the hernandez pincers a great service 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:55.260
 backwards hooking the appearance of 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.950
 what is franking the auction that 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.410
 find 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.270
 the great action of mosquera to avoid 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.640
 the commitment to the first 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.440
 would arrive more until from pockets 1 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.140
 time the center of the franc header 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.130
 had already taken out or would take ceballos and 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.710
 would be with a man less than 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.750
 reference in the area so after the 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.380
 attitude of high courage to look for her as 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.030
 9 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.370
 the only great one that clarifies the commitment 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.580
 was the counterattack holds well guard 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:24.490
 yields to polo mine but morals in its 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:27.210
 only intervention does it in a great way 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.210
 the medium distance shot 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.369
 and the appearance of maple to mark the 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:33.200
 first the commitment that al qaeda was 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.210
 invalidated badly and validated by the judge of 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.220
 line because we see the recovery not 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.979
 was out of the game for not being the auction 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.600
 of case stability and maximum maple not 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.939
 invalidity or online wrongly 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.520
 we reiterate and I go began to distress 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.530
 it stopped generating after about 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.149
 minutes would appear this decision is great 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.429
 mosquera intervention again 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.530
 taking out the changed hand to avoid the 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:56.420
 so much of the commitment after he repealed 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.460
 on the right the rubber center and 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.080
 as 9 we had asked for good as 9 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.810
 appeared the red one for the efesÃ© 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.330
 central needs to take shelter 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.310
 in defense it was necessary to attack in 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.200
 search for the headbutt and I would get it 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.569
 it was eye then the voice in the exit 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.400
 it started from over the field 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.680
 frank leandro and when he controls with 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.540
 right I knew how I was going to define 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.730
 I steal them from the point of view 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.680
 defining the far post anything 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.750
 we separated that it was a 20 more than fair 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.090
 the voice for everything he did for everything 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.980
 what originated from everything that came and 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.980
 at the end by how he defined
