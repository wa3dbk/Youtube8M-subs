00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
everywhere there was taffy all over the

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.590 
everywhere there was taffy all over the
floor<00:04:10.680> all<00:04:10.950> over<00:04:11.130> the<00:04:11.400> counters<00:04:11.820> all<00:04:12.150> over<00:04:12.480> the

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
floor all over the counters all over the

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.750 
floor all over the counters all over the
pots<00:04:12.870> and<00:04:13.230> then<00:04:13.260> pretty<00:04:14.130> much<00:04:14.250> they<00:04:14.580> had<00:04:14.730> a

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
pots and then pretty much they had a

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.250 
pots and then pretty much they had a
bunch<00:04:14.910> of<00:04:15.060> weed<00:04:15.270> candies<00:04:15.690> my<00:04:15.840> friends<00:04:16.140> were

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
bunch of weed candies my friends were

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.110 
bunch of weed candies my friends were
over<00:04:16.290> to<00:04:16.680> at<00:04:16.830> that<00:04:17.010> time<00:04:17.220> it<00:04:17.430> was<00:04:17.549> just<00:04:17.670> really

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
over to at that time it was just really

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.630 
over to at that time it was just really
really<00:04:18.269> weird<00:04:18.660> really<00:04:19.530> really<00:04:19.799> awkward<00:04:20.310> and

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
really weird really really awkward and

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.520 
really weird really really awkward and
that's<00:04:21.090> one<00:04:21.330> of<00:04:21.359> the<00:04:21.450> main<00:04:21.600> reasons<00:04:21.959> I<00:04:22.080> really

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
that's one of the main reasons I really

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.380 
that's one of the main reasons I really
hated<00:04:22.710> her<00:04:22.890> she<00:04:23.130> was<00:04:23.280> stupid<00:04:23.820> she<00:04:24.300> was

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
hated her she was stupid she was

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.200 
hated her she was stupid she was
annoying<00:04:24.690> and<00:04:25.140> that<00:04:25.680> I<00:04:25.710> I<00:04:25.980> what<00:04:26.850> do<00:04:26.910> you<00:04:26.940> do

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
annoying and that I I what do you do

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.120 
annoying and that I I what do you do
when<00:04:27.810> someone's<00:04:28.230> in<00:04:28.320> your<00:04:28.440> house<00:04:28.560> making<00:04:28.830> weed

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
when someone's in your house making weed

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.440 
when someone's in your house making weed
candies<00:04:29.550> when<00:04:29.700> you<00:04:29.790> don't<00:04:29.940> think<00:04:30.060> anyone's

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
candies when you don't think anyone's

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:31.850

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
there obviously I'm not gonna like the

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.040 
there obviously I'm not gonna like the
person<00:04:32.070> so<00:04:32.910> that's<00:04:33.360> pretty<00:04:33.660> much<00:04:33.810> yeah

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
person so that's pretty much yeah

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.180 
person so that's pretty much yeah
apparently<00:04:34.350> the<00:04:34.620> whole<00:04:34.740> thing<00:04:34.890> was<00:04:34.980> a<00:04:35.010> big

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
apparently the whole thing was a big

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.610 
apparently the whole thing was a big
flop<00:04:35.430> their<00:04:35.669> plan<00:04:35.940> was<00:04:35.970> to<00:04:36.330> sell<00:04:36.690> them<00:04:36.990> make

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
flop their plan was to sell them make

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.380 
flop their plan was to sell them make
money<00:04:37.919> off<00:04:38.130> of<00:04:38.310> it<00:04:38.430> apparently<00:04:38.700> that<00:04:39.120> is<00:04:39.240> quite

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
money off of it apparently that is quite

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.260 
money off of it apparently that is quite
absolutely<00:04:40.050> horrible<00:04:40.440> and<00:04:40.970> nothing<00:04:41.970> turned

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
absolutely horrible and nothing turned

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.850 
absolutely horrible and nothing turned
out<00:04:42.450> as<00:04:42.570> planned<00:04:42.900> but<00:04:43.200> that's<00:04:43.410> just<00:04:43.560> weird

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
out as planned but that's just weird

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.190 
out as planned but that's just weird
like<00:04:44.040> I<00:04:44.310> don't<00:04:44.490> really<00:04:44.610> know<00:04:44.910> why<00:04:45.600> you<00:04:45.660> do<00:04:46.050> that

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
like I don't really know why you do that

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.020
