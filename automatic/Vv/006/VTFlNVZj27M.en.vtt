00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:08.200
 hello youtube friends today we are going to 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.990
 prepare some rich Antioquian beans 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:14.679
 that we have placed in water previously 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:18.099
 so that they are softening we are going to 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:21.300
 use Colombian bolaroja beans 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:21.300
 also here in Bogota Colombia 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.980
 we are going to place them in a pressure cooker 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.980
 what are we going to use 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.230
 we discovered is water by two portions 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.380
 that are well covered and the orioles 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.250
 they are soft 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.890
 and they are in 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.020
 since the previous night we are going to try 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.790
 an envelope if all the chicken broth does not 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.670
 we are going to use today can be 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.830
 use broth of rib broth 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.890
 doparnos proven by provenance to 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:57.170
 highlight the flavor of the beans we're going 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.000
 to place tool envelope 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.640
 of this new product we are going to try it 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.470
 how are we behaving we have placed 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.470
 and the pot to the fire 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.240
 we peel a carrot 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.280
 and we put it 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.960
 in the pot as it goes 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.600
 I will be going through the video 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.990
 indicating all the ingredients how 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.540
 they are placing one by one 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.960
 without any problem 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.930
 let's add 250 grams of bacon 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.030
 pork meat bacon 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.890
 we are going to bite it very well and we are going to 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.890
 place in the pot also 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.610
 let's use a big onion and 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.610
 a tomato 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.670
 normal tomato red mate 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.460
 we are going to chop the tomato very well 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:06.330
 and we 're going to put it in the pot on 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.770
 tomato is going to dissolve is the period to 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.759
 create 1 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.759
 a rich flavor too 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.950
 Chop the onion into julienne these 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.460
 small ones too and we already have it 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.280
 involved 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.610
 and we will also place in the pot of 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.610
 once 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.650
 we are going to stir a little here already 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.650
 see the cold are soft 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.050
 we are going to add a little color 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.319
 we are using the color the king to his 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.629
 preference 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.849
 the cold releases to a very rich ink 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:23.470
 a color of the one I like 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:26.030
 highlight it a little 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.500
 it is your preference 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.440
 if you want to apply color 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.630
 wind a little salt to teaspoon 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.910
 very small so that the beans do not 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:39.590
 they are salaried they have flavor of the broth 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.130
 of chicken will then be left with a 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.130
 delicious flavor 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.790
 let's cover the pot 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.940
 for a space of 25 minutes we are 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:55.250
 using a powerful pot black and 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.250
 very good decker very fast 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.280
 here have passed 20 minutes 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:05.099
 the hole begins to let us know that 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.700
 beans are almost going to give the 5 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:07.700
 more minutes 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.720
 there is 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.870
 we are going to this word have already passed 25 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.479
 years 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.900
 exactly since we have placed the 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:29.880
 different ingredients 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:34.720
 the entire network and here it is 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:37.930
 already tells us the pressure cooker what 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:43.650
 let's get the air out of the pot and let's go 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.650
 to be to see how the beans 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.949
 well we challenge side we already see that the 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.139
 spear in the chin is bland 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:09.639
 also cooked is well blandita 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:12.009
 then we are going to take it out 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:14.190
 let's carefully take out the 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:16.380
 carrot 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:19.590
 It's nice, it 's good 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:21.500
 very pretty has an aroma 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.730
 very rich very nice the beans 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.930
 let's get a little bit of beans and 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.080
 we will place it together with the 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:31.320
 carrot in the blender jar 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:33.980
 We are going to take 23 tablespoons of the broth 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.980
 the beans 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:42.310
 and we're going to liquefy this carrot with the 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:46.280
 frijolitos and the broth to give us 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:48.139
 an exquisite cream that we are going to add 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:52.270
 we are going to add to the pot so that we 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:52.270
 Give a little more flavor and thicken 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:57.860
 well we believe that in rich 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:07.099
 we see the consistency of the cream that has 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.889
 the carrots and the beans 

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:12.370
 the broth before we will add it 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:12.370
 back to the pot 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:20.250
 You may also add the beans 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:22.710
 from the beginning ripe banana itches and 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:25.670
 total can be added is very good 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:27.560
 it is used a lot if in Colombia 

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.760
 but today we do not 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:33.450

 and we are going to cover the pot again 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:44.350
