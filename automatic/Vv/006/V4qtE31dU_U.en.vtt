00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:10.890 

so<00:00:09.309> today<00:00:09.549> we're<00:00:09.730> looking<00:00:09.759> at<00:00:10.059> loose<00:00:10.330> descents

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:10.900 
so today we're looking at loose descents

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.379 
so today we're looking at loose descents
this<00:00:11.679> waiting<00:00:12.129> at<00:00:12.280> that<00:00:12.429> horrible<00:00:12.699> feeling<00:00:13.000> of

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:13.389 
this waiting at that horrible feeling of

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:15.660 
this waiting at that horrible feeling of
picking<00:00:14.379> up<00:00:14.500> speed<00:00:14.679> when<00:00:15.160> you're<00:00:15.279> losing

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:15.670 
picking up speed when you're losing

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.490 
picking up speed when you're losing
control<00:00:15.699> at<00:00:16.150> the<00:00:16.209> same<00:00:16.240> time<00:00:16.630> so<00:00:17.230> you've<00:00:17.320> got

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:17.500 
control at the same time so you've got

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.779 
control at the same time so you've got
to<00:00:17.560> be<00:00:17.650> really<00:00:17.950> careful<00:00:18.130> with<00:00:18.400> your<00:00:18.460> brakes

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:18.789 
to be really careful with your brakes

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:21.810 
to be really careful with your brakes
think<00:00:19.270> about<00:00:19.599> being<00:00:20.470> nice<00:00:20.860> and<00:00:21.189> smoothly<00:00:21.489> or

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:21.820 
think about being nice and smoothly or

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.189 
think about being nice and smoothly or
input<00:00:22.180> into<00:00:22.419> the<00:00:22.480> bike<00:00:22.660> you<00:00:22.840> don't<00:00:23.020> wanna<00:00:23.140> be

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:23.199 
input into the bike you don't wanna be

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:24.450 
input into the bike you don't wanna be
throwing<00:00:23.529> the<00:00:23.590> bike<00:00:23.770> around<00:00:24.070> all<00:00:24.160> over<00:00:24.310> the

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.460 
throwing the bike around all over the

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.790 
throwing the bike around all over the
place<00:00:24.640> is<00:00:24.820> you<00:00:25.029> lose<00:00:25.329> grip<00:00:25.630> think<00:00:26.619> about

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800 
place is you lose grip think about

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.650 
place is you lose grip think about
neutral<00:00:27.250> position<00:00:27.640> and<00:00:27.910> then<00:00:28.029> coming<00:00:28.450> back

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.660 
neutral position and then coming back

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.299 
neutral position and then coming back
from<00:00:28.899> there<00:00:29.110> onto<00:00:29.529> the<00:00:29.559> rear<00:00:29.800> wheel<00:00:30.009> when<00:00:30.219> you

00:00:30.299 --> 00:00:30.309 
from there onto the rear wheel when you

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:31.679 
from there onto the rear wheel when you
need<00:00:30.460> to<00:00:30.550> slow<00:00:30.730> down<00:00:30.759> fast

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:31.689 
need to slow down fast

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:33.930 
need to slow down fast
being<00:00:32.230> careful<00:00:32.439> with<00:00:32.649> a<00:00:32.770> front<00:00:33.010> brake<00:00:33.190> but

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
being careful with a front brake but

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.580 
being careful with a front brake but
then<00:00:34.090> putting<00:00:34.360> a<00:00:34.539> bit<00:00:34.719> more<00:00:34.899> weight<00:00:35.079> back<00:00:35.379> to

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590 
then putting a bit more weight back to

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.139 
then putting a bit more weight back to
the<00:00:35.680> front<00:00:35.890> wheel<00:00:36.070> way<00:00:36.309> you<00:00:36.370> need<00:00:36.640> grip<00:00:36.940> for

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149 
the front wheel way you need grip for

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:39.389 
the front wheel way you need grip for
cornering<00:00:37.469> you<00:00:38.469> brakes<00:00:38.770> aren't<00:00:39.039> gonna<00:00:39.190> be<00:00:39.309> as

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:39.399 
cornering you brakes aren't gonna be as

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:41.489 
cornering you brakes aren't gonna be as
effective<00:00:39.969> so<00:00:40.239> you've<00:00:40.360> got<00:00:40.539> a<00:00:40.570> bear<00:00:41.140> that<00:00:41.379> in

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:41.499 
effective so you've got a bear that in

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:44.069 
effective so you've got a bear that in
mind<00:00:41.530> really<00:00:42.159> also<00:00:42.760> it's<00:00:43.210> really<00:00:43.269> good<00:00:43.749> to<00:00:43.899> be

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:44.079 
mind really also it's really good to be

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:46.380 
mind really also it's really good to be
good<00:00:44.559> at<00:00:44.710> drifting<00:00:45.190> so<00:00:45.699> that<00:00:45.909> when<00:00:46.089> the<00:00:46.210> bike

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
good at drifting so that when the bike

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.329 
good at drifting so that when the bike
does<00:00:46.629> go<00:00:46.839> sideways<00:00:47.109> you<00:00:47.530> know<00:00:47.769> how<00:00:47.980> to<00:00:48.039> control

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:48.339 
does go sideways you know how to control

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:49.709 
does go sideways you know how to control
that<00:00:48.609> and<00:00:48.789> you're<00:00:48.909> confident<00:00:49.359> in<00:00:49.569> those

00:00:49.709 --> 00:00:49.719 
that and you're confident in those

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:53.520 
that and you're confident in those
positions<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:51.039> Mark<00:00:51.969> is<00:00:52.749> that<00:00:52.809> slow<00:00:53.109> motion<00:00:53.469> I

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
positions is Mark is that slow motion I

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.590 
positions is Mark is that slow motion I
can<00:00:53.649> tell<00:00:53.920> probably<00:00:54.909> about<00:00:55.149> the<00:00:55.269> right<00:00:55.390> speed

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
can tell probably about the right speed

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.989 
can tell probably about the right speed
for<00:00:55.659> mark

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:56.999 
for mark

00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:00.059 
for mark
keep<00:00:57.999> your<00:00:58.149> head<00:00:58.269> up<00:00:58.300> look<00:00:58.929> where<00:00:59.229> you<00:00:59.589> want<00:00:59.859> to

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:00.069 
keep your head up look where you want to

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:02.639 
keep your head up look where you want to
go<00:01:00.309> and<00:01:00.699> get<00:01:01.210> a<00:01:01.239> feel<00:01:01.569> for<00:01:01.600> letting<00:01:02.199> that<00:01:02.319> bike

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
go and get a feel for letting that bike

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:04.530 
go and get a feel for letting that bike
dance<00:01:03.010> around<00:01:03.399> beneath<00:01:03.639> you<00:01:03.879> a<00:01:03.909> little<00:01:04.180> bit<00:01:04.330> so

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
dance around beneath you a little bit so

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.930 
dance around beneath you a little bit so
the<00:01:04.600> bike<00:01:04.809> will<00:01:05.050> move<00:01:05.290> around<00:01:05.500> a<00:01:05.800> bit

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
the bike will move around a bit

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.680 
the bike will move around a bit
hopefully<00:01:06.940> with<00:01:07.030> your<00:01:07.060> weight<00:01:07.330> in<00:01:07.450> the<00:01:07.540> right

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
hopefully with your weight in the right

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.030 
hopefully with your weight in the right
spot<00:01:08.049> and<00:01:08.200> looking<00:01:08.470> at<00:01:08.560> the<00:01:08.620> right<00:01:08.770> place

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
spot and looking at the right place

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.010 
spot and looking at the right place
you'll<00:01:09.729> keep<00:01:09.940> driving<00:01:10.450> that<00:01:10.479> bike<00:01:10.750> in<00:01:10.960> a

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
you'll keep driving that bike in a

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.440 
you'll keep driving that bike in a
straight<00:01:11.260> line<00:01:12.120> occasionally<00:01:13.120> you<00:01:13.300> might

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
straight line occasionally you might

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.030 
straight line occasionally you might
find<00:01:13.810> you're<00:01:14.020> going<00:01:14.170> a<00:01:14.260> little<00:01:14.410> bit<00:01:14.590> faster

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
find you're going a little bit faster

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.830 
find you're going a little bit faster
than<00:01:15.160> you<00:01:15.400> would<00:01:15.520> like<00:01:15.550> but<00:01:16.450> if<00:01:16.510> you<00:01:16.600> try<00:01:16.810> and

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
than you would like but if you try and

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.660 
than you would like but if you try and
scrub<00:01:17.260> too<00:01:17.440> much<00:01:17.650> speed<00:01:17.980> off<00:01:18.130> those<00:01:18.370> brakes

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
scrub too much speed off those brakes

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.360 
scrub too much speed off those brakes
you<00:01:18.970> know<00:01:19.090> lose<00:01:19.270> control<00:01:19.720> so<00:01:20.650> keep<00:01:21.100> your<00:01:21.220> head

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.370 
you know lose control so keep your head

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.790 
you know lose control so keep your head
up<00:01:21.430> deal<00:01:22.390> with<00:01:22.570> it<00:01:22.660> as<00:01:22.750> best<00:01:22.990> you<00:01:23.140> can<00:01:23.350> and<00:01:23.650> then

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
up deal with it as best you can and then

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.220 
up deal with it as best you can and then
look<00:01:24.070> for<00:01:24.400> a<00:01:24.430> good<00:01:24.670> spot<00:01:24.730> to<00:01:25.360> get<00:01:25.780> back<00:01:26.020> on

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.230 
look for a good spot to get back on

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.960 
look for a good spot to get back on
those<00:01:26.380> brakes

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.730 

keep<00:01:30.180> your<00:01:30.330> head<00:01:30.540> up<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.930> look<00:01:31.020> towards<00:01:31.620> the

drop your outside pedal but you may need

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.830 
drop your outside pedal but you may need
to<00:01:37.470> improvise<00:01:37.950> for<00:01:38.010> this<00:01:38.340> as<00:01:38.940> objects<00:01:39.450> tend<00:01:39.720> to

your front wheel but this can damage
your<00:01:49.740> frame<00:01:50.010> it's<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.880> good<00:01:51.060> idea<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.570> consider

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
your frame it's a good idea to consider

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.230 
your frame it's a good idea to consider
getting<00:01:52.890> some<00:01:53.040> protection<00:01:53.730> on<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.000> downtube

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
getting some protection on the downtube

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.390 
getting some protection on the downtube
okay<00:01:57.240> so<00:01:57.300> here<00:01:57.600> I'm<00:01:57.750> dropping<00:01:58.320> downhill<00:01:59.010> into

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
okay so here I'm dropping downhill into

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.910 
okay so here I'm dropping downhill into
a<00:01:59.430> stream<00:01:59.900> first<00:02:00.900> part<00:02:01.290> is<00:02:01.380> quite<00:02:01.560> nicely

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
a stream first part is quite nicely

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.000 
a stream first part is quite nicely
packed<00:02:02.460> so<00:02:02.850> relatively<00:02:03.810> easy<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.200> ride<00:02:04.410> and

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
packed so relatively easy to ride and

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.130 
packed so relatively easy to ride and
then<00:02:05.100> this<00:02:05.250> part<00:02:05.580> is<00:02:05.729> quite<00:02:05.880> loose<00:02:06.600> with<00:02:06.930> some

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
then this part is quite loose with some

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.020 
then this part is quite loose with some
big<00:02:07.320> stones<00:02:07.650> are<00:02:07.920> likely<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.369> move<00:02:08.520> around<00:02:08.820> if

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
big stones are likely to move around if

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.270 
big stones are likely to move around if
I<00:02:09.119> hit<00:02:09.270> them<00:02:09.479> so<00:02:10.170> I<00:02:10.200> need<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.500> predict<00:02:10.860> my<00:02:11.070> line

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
I hit them so I need to predict my line

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.980 
I hit them so I need to predict my line
early<00:02:11.640> so<00:02:11.820> don't<00:02:12.030> go<00:02:12.180> it<00:02:12.330> riding<00:02:12.570> into<00:02:12.750> these

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
early so don't go it riding into these

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.470 
early so don't go it riding into these
really<00:02:13.260> big<00:02:13.440> ones<00:02:13.709> but<00:02:14.430> also<00:02:14.580> I<00:02:15.180> need<00:02:15.390> to

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
really big ones but also I need to

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.150 
really big ones but also I need to
change<00:02:15.720> gear<00:02:16.200> early<00:02:16.530> as<00:02:16.590> well<00:02:16.800> because<00:02:17.070> I'm

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
change gear early as well because I'm

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.400 
change gear early as well because I'm
coming<00:02:17.430> into<00:02:17.640> a<00:02:17.760> little<00:02:18.090> tricky<00:02:18.450> uphill<00:02:18.840> and

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
coming into a little tricky uphill and

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.110 
coming into a little tricky uphill and
there's<00:02:19.620> no<00:02:19.830> way<00:02:20.100> that<00:02:20.310> I'd<00:02:20.430> be<00:02:20.760> wanting<00:02:21.090> to

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
there's no way that I'd be wanting to

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.940 
there's no way that I'd be wanting to
spin<00:02:21.420> my<00:02:21.600> pedals<00:02:22.020> through<00:02:22.290> there<00:02:22.470> to<00:02:22.680> change

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
spin my pedals through there to change

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.340 
spin my pedals through there to change
gear<00:02:23.250> getting<00:02:24.209> that<00:02:24.360> gear<00:02:24.600> really<00:02:24.810> if<00:02:24.990> I<00:02:25.110> can

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
gear getting that gear really if I can

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.230 
gear getting that gear really if I can
so<00:02:25.890> I<00:02:25.920> can<00:02:25.950> power<00:02:26.340> up<00:02:26.520> this<00:02:26.760> tricky<00:02:27.000> little

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
so I can power up this tricky little

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.150 
so I can power up this tricky little
lock<00:02:27.360> on<00:02:27.570> the<00:02:27.720> way

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.950 

this<00:02:32.790> section<00:02:33.300> I'm<00:02:33.570> going<00:02:33.690> to<00:02:33.780> deal<00:02:33.930> with

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
this section I'm going to deal with

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.720 
this section I'm going to deal with
differently<00:02:34.620> because<00:02:35.220> there's<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.460> bit<00:02:35.610> of<00:02:35.700> a

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
differently because there's a bit of a

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.850 
differently because there's a bit of a
gully<00:02:35.970> in<00:02:36.210> the<00:02:36.300> middle<00:02:36.630> that's<00:02:37.260> where<00:02:37.530> all<00:02:37.710> the

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
gully in the middle that's where all the

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.130 
gully in the middle that's where all the
loose<00:02:38.100> stones<00:02:38.460> are<00:02:38.610> falling<00:02:38.940> into<00:02:39.120> so<00:02:39.840> I'm<00:02:39.930> now

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
loose stones are falling into so I'm now

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.260 
loose stones are falling into so I'm now
actually<00:02:40.380> going<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.740> pick<00:02:40.890> a<00:02:40.920> line<00:02:41.250> up<00:02:41.820> and<00:02:42.210> out

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
actually going to pick a line up and out

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.360 
actually going to pick a line up and out
of<00:02:42.420> that<00:02:42.570> gully<00:02:42.870> and<00:02:43.260> out<00:02:43.680> of<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:43.920> loose<00:02:44.100> stuff

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
of that gully and out of the loose stuff

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.420 
of that gully and out of the loose stuff
a<00:02:45.080> soft<00:02:46.080> suspension<00:02:46.590> setup<00:02:47.010> is<00:02:47.100> going<00:02:47.220> to<00:02:47.310> give

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
a soft suspension setup is going to give

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.550 
a soft suspension setup is going to give
you<00:02:47.550> really<00:02:47.790> good<00:02:48.120> small<00:02:48.540> bump<00:02:48.780> sensitivity

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
you really good small bump sensitivity

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.710 
you really good small bump sensitivity
through<00:02:49.770> these<00:02:49.980> rocks<00:02:50.280> but<00:02:51.210> if<00:02:51.360> you<00:02:51.450> have<00:02:51.600> it

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
through these rocks but if you have it

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.600 
through these rocks but if you have it
too<00:02:51.960> soft<00:02:52.320> when<00:02:52.620> you<00:02:52.680> start<00:02:53.100> hitting<00:02:53.310> these

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
too soft when you start hitting these

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.700 
too soft when you start hitting these
cups<00:02:54.000> that<00:02:54.630> might<00:02:54.810> be<00:02:54.960> made<00:02:55.170> by<00:02:55.350> these<00:02:55.410> bigger

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
cups that might be made by these bigger

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.980 
cups that might be made by these bigger
stones<00:02:56.070> and<00:02:56.850> you<00:02:57.000> start<00:02:57.270> getting<00:02:57.480> weight<00:02:57.780> up

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
stones and you start getting weight up

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.650 
stones and you start getting weight up
and<00:02:58.200> forward<00:02:58.410> it<00:02:58.560> which<00:02:58.650> isn't<00:02:58.860> good<00:02:59.250> so<00:02:59.660> maybe

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
and forward it which isn't good so maybe

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.110 
and forward it which isn't good so maybe
soft<00:03:01.380> dish<00:03:01.710> but<00:03:02.070> progressive<00:03:02.640> Spencer<00:03:03.060> is

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
soft dish but progressive Spencer is

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.570 
soft dish but progressive Spencer is
going<00:03:03.210> to<00:03:03.270> help<00:03:03.510> also<00:03:04.290> tires<00:03:04.830> I'm<00:03:05.340> going<00:03:05.520> to

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
going to help also tires I'm going to

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.310 
going to help also tires I'm going to
run<00:03:05.760> mine<00:03:05.970> really<00:03:06.360> firm<00:03:06.570> especially<00:03:06.900> that

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
run mine really firm especially that

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.470 
run mine really firm especially that
rear<00:03:07.560> one<00:03:07.860> so<00:03:08.400> take<00:03:08.610> a<00:03:08.640> lot<00:03:09.000> of<00:03:09.030> battering

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
rear one so take a lot of battering

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.390 
rear one so take a lot of battering
through<00:03:09.750> here<00:03:10.050> you<00:03:10.590> can<00:03:10.680> have<00:03:10.770> to<00:03:10.890> be<00:03:10.950> careful

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
through here you can have to be careful

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.010 
through here you can have to be careful
and<00:03:11.550> maybe<00:03:11.700> think<00:03:11.970> about<00:03:12.030> unweighting<00:03:12.870> those

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
and maybe think about unweighting those

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.330 
and maybe think about unweighting those
wheels<00:03:13.260> when<00:03:13.620> you<00:03:13.680> start<00:03:13.920> hitting<00:03:14.070> those

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
wheels when you start hitting those

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.410 
wheels when you start hitting those
really<00:03:14.730> big<00:03:14.910> rocks<00:03:16.220> okay<00:03:17.220> so<00:03:17.280> this<00:03:17.700> trail<00:03:18.060> is

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
really big rocks okay so this trail is

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.830 
really big rocks okay so this trail is
dirt<00:03:19.230> with<00:03:19.740> stones<00:03:20.460> on<00:03:20.700> top<00:03:20.730> so<00:03:21.690> that's

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
dirt with stones on top so that's

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.180 
dirt with stones on top so that's
something<00:03:22.020> you<00:03:22.110> gotta<00:03:22.320> be<00:03:22.410> a<00:03:22.440> bit<00:03:22.590> careful<00:03:22.860> off

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
something you gotta be a bit careful off

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.430 
something you gotta be a bit careful off
you'll<00:03:23.430> go<00:03:23.610> from<00:03:23.880> having<00:03:24.270> loads<00:03:24.570> of<00:03:24.810> grip<00:03:25.170> and

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
you'll go from having loads of grip and

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.740 
you'll go from having loads of grip and
then<00:03:26.130> riding<00:03:26.400> on<00:03:26.640> the<00:03:26.850> top<00:03:27.030> of<00:03:27.180> these<00:03:27.330> stones

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
then riding on the top of these stones

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.270 
then riding on the top of these stones
they<00:03:27.990> almost<00:03:28.110> act<00:03:28.320> like<00:03:28.410> marbles<00:03:29.070> where

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
they almost act like marbles where

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.070 
they almost act like marbles where
you're<00:03:29.370> going<00:03:29.490> to<00:03:29.550> roll<00:03:29.760> off<00:03:29.970> top<00:03:30.240> of<00:03:30.360> them<00:03:30.480> to

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
you're going to roll off top of them to

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.420 
you're going to roll off top of them to
try<00:03:31.260> and<00:03:31.320> predict<00:03:31.740> where<00:03:32.010> you're<00:03:32.190> going<00:03:32.340> to

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
try and predict where you're going to
