00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:18.000
 open the capsule and one of the boxes for 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.070
 start to open one drawer 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.779

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.090
 buy 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:27.930
 then we buy a key for it costing 93 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.019
 Ruble at the moment Julia key button 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.690
 to the right there are different keys everything is everything 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:35.910
 they cost almost the same yes they are all 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.420
 equally except for the capsules there a little bit 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.550
 more expensive so buy the key from you already 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.700

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.920

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.739
 Inventory already these two keys means 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:54.360
 first of all let's open the hunting weapon not 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.250
 case why I chose him I chose for 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:02.039
 the fact that you can knock out a hunting knife 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:06.390
 firstly secondly ok volcano ok 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:08.760
 swirling and and all she and 2000 pulse 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.250
 and atomic disputes are generally shorter very 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.710
 good things you can knock out so now 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:18.020
 I'll open this box right in front of you 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:22.290
 Well wish me luck 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.810
 I believe that I will get very good 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.810
 thing 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.810
 321 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.640
 come on come on come on 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:38.720

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.140
 it's in it, we have knocked out p90 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.500
 module 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:47.450
 I already have it so I 'll have to 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:50.240
 sell but not lucky me in principle 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:54.140
 a good item already has it all 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:58.429
 see so much quality so straight with 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.670
 plant so we have a little bit 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:04.659
 worn let's go straight from the factory replace 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:07.149
 sell later but we still have a capsule 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.729
 so right in front of you now open 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:13.370
 why I chose this capsule I chose 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.010
 because I don't know why just like that 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.060
 I decided 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.769
 stickers, in principle, I donâ€™t care what 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:24.739
 stick no matter what so well 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:30.380
 let's use the 3 in 1 key 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:36.709
 wish me luck already need that already 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:39.100

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.100
 guys 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:49.879
 To go nuts so this time I will put 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:54.019
 a sticker on a good thing or rather now 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:55.790
 we reflect on what we put it on the 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:03:00.459
 Anything you can breakfast ska apply 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:06.069
 children how to think, or as you would strike 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:06.069
 somewhere I have now it was here she Pts 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:15.490
 but let's apply it here but 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.459
 In principle, this is all I am especially more 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.130
 have nothing to show will not yet boxes of 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.530
 then we will open them the day 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.500
 do not forget that share with steam keys 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:32.080
 will be but I found out that I will get this money 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.080
 but in October it's already wild 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.390
 somewhere in the beginning in the middle and maybe in 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.600
 After a look at how I will like 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:43.440
 just I get the money immediately after take off 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:46.209
 review on the keys and then go contest 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:51.370
 if the competition succeeds then everyone will get 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:54.040
 their keys are undoubtedly in principle well 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.660
