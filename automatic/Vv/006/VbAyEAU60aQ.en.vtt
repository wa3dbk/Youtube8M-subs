00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:06.209
 the photography is all exciting also the history of photography 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.259
 here we can against some examples d 

00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:13.429
 effects 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:18.720
 that man ray has made one of the leading surrealist photographers 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.880
 of the 20th century eaves of the 20s where 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.439
 he used the solarization technique 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:31.359
 in a creative way solarization is an effect that you get 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.940
 in traditional photography on the negative 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.760
 rex put to a white light source during the developer 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.070
 this the photoshop 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.440
 can still have 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.620
 pretty interest 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.130
 to learn to apply 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:54.490
 Bone solarization style effects can be about dissensions directly 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.200
 similar effects 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:03.610
 for example let's go to this image where we are going to first of all discard 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.340
 the color i will also take advantage of in this tutorial 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.210
 for will be some uses of layers of justice 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.000
 then first 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.490
 let's discard 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.590
 the color even when we can also work 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:18.990
 directly 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.820
 with the image in rgb 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.210
 we are going to 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.500
 work first 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.830
 with black and white image 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.310
 then in the adjustment layers we are going to apply 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.700
 one able to recover 5 and black 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.840
 then in this way we can 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.710
 improve our 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.310
 conversion 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.750
 must see is that he can notice how to move the yellows I'm 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.840
 improving the appearance of the lacava car license plate 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.640
 because I'm 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.000
 modifying the influence of yellow 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.820
 the black and white that I am creating also the same happens 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.920
 when I sign for example 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.210
 the citizens 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.869
 then this is a way to create a black and white 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.589
 does not have more michel requirements 

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:15.289
 my likes 

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:17.569
 so let's leave it 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.429
 at some point 

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:22.339
 and now what are we already with 

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:27.309
 this plan that simulated black we can already directly convert the image there 

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:28.189
 wear 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:31.189
 we need to work the solarization 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:36.579
 is to fight backwards that he to work with a single channel in scale 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:37.419
 of grays 

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:40.419
 let's tell them beating to discard 

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:44.559
 the layers and now we have the image 

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:46.029
 in a single channel 

00:02:46.029 --> 00:02:51.059
 in grayscale let's apply a new adjustment layer this is a layer of 

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.769
 adjustment 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.389
 d sane his famous 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:56.769
 expand this window 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:58.449
 i are already 

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:01.469
 with the curve applied what we are going to do 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:04.670
 well invest 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.409
 the application 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:08.749
 of the light 

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:10.000
 in the shadows 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.489
 how are we going to do that we're just going to put a point in the middle 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.289
 we will go 

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:18.199
 to the top 

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:19.849
 i are 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:22.579
 creating 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.599
 a kind of solarization because we are combining 

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:32.260
 a positive part and a negative part of the image the curves are not 

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:34.209
 many possibilities 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:39.479
 of course dee that create very attractive effects 

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:42.039
 and this is then the way 

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:43.789
 to perform 

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:46.059
 a sound 

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:49.609
 or an effect similar to a solarization 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:52.709
 starting from the color image 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.779
 let's work now with the image 

00:03:55.779 --> 00:03:58.319
 directly with the color channels 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.249
 because we can also get to get 

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:02.410
 --results 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:03.849
 very attractive 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:04.939
 working 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:05.879
 with three channels
