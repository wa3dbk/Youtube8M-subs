00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
the three maps on this this is armored

the three maps on this this is armored
shield<00:00:23.660> the<00:00:24.660> basic<00:00:25.080> premise<00:00:25.439> of<00:00:25.650> takes

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
shield the basic premise of takes

shield the basic premise of takes
periodic<00:00:27.330> gameplay<00:00:27.779> or<00:00:28.439> this<00:00:29.279> game<00:00:30.060> mode<00:00:30.330> is

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
periodic gameplay or this game mode is

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.400 
periodic gameplay or this game mode is
think<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:32.250> as<00:00:32.369> conquest<00:00:33.270> with<00:00:33.630> one<00:00:33.840> flag<00:00:34.170> I

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
think of it as conquest with one flag I

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.479 
think of it as conquest with one flag I
guess<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.860> best<00:00:34.890> way<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.219> could<00:00:35.370> describe

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
guess is the best way I could describe

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.110 
guess is the best way I could describe
it<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.090> have<00:00:36.239> one<00:00:36.450> central<00:00:36.840> flag<00:00:37.700> set<00:00:38.700> in<00:00:38.940> a

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
it you have one central flag set in a

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.150 
it you have one central flag set in a
certain<00:00:39.329> particular<00:00:40.020> location<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.860> fixed

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
certain particular location a fixed

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.490 
certain particular location a fixed
location<00:00:41.309> on<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.940> map<00:00:41.989> the<00:00:42.989> objective<00:00:43.440> is

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
location on the map the objective is

location on the map the objective is
secure<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:44.040> point<00:00:44.309> obviously<00:00:45.829> vehicles<00:00:46.829> are

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
secure that point obviously vehicles are

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.889 
secure that point obviously vehicles are
a<00:00:47.750> factor<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:49.100> objective<00:00:50.100> each<00:00:51.059> team<00:00:51.660> has

a factor in that objective each team has
numerous<00:00:52.860> ground-based<00:00:53.760> vehicles<00:00:54.360> only

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
numerous ground-based vehicles only

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.549 
numerous ground-based vehicles only
tanks<00:00:55.260> basically<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.860> choose<00:00:56.100> from<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:57.559> your

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
objectives go secure that point there's

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.399 
objectives go secure that point there's
several<00:01:02.820> issues<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.600> be<00:01:03.629> concerned<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.260> when

or laser designation because obviously

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.940 
or laser designation because obviously
distance<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.150> factor<00:01:21.720> you've<00:01:22.470> got<00:01:22.650> pretty

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
distance is a factor you've got pretty

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.560 
distance is a factor you've got pretty
much<00:01:23.040> wide<00:01:23.310> open<00:01:23.610> spaces<00:01:23.880> on<00:01:24.180> just<00:01:24.390> about<00:01:24.479> all

there's<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.850> distance<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.540> barrier<00:01:48.840> there

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
there's a distance a barrier there

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.069 
there's a distance a barrier there
everyone<00:01:49.710> run<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.420> pp-2000<00:01:51.420> which<00:01:51.540> has<00:01:51.810> been

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
everyone run the pp-2000 which has been

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.590 
everyone run the pp-2000 which has been
buffed<00:01:52.619> after<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.250> patch<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:54.149> increase<00:01:54.450> his

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
buffed after the patch to increase his

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.179 
buffed after the patch to increase his
distance<00:01:55.110> so<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.439> quite<00:01:55.619> effective<00:01:55.860> at

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
distance so it is quite effective at

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.840 
distance so it is quite effective at
range<00:01:56.460> as<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.729> can<00:01:56.880> see<00:01:57.030> in<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.360> clip

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
range as you can see in that clip

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.800 
range as you can see in that clip
basically<00:01:59.850> though<00:02:00.030> just<00:02:00.509> like<00:02:00.659> any

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
basically though just like any

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.600 
basically though just like any

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
and your you can't spot on other players

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.130 
and your you can't spot on other players
by<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:44.500> way<00:02:44.710> that's<00:02:44.950> a<00:02:45.160> big<00:02:45.400> problem<00:02:46.140> you

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
by the way that's a big problem you

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.510 
by the way that's a big problem you
can't<00:02:47.350> spawn<00:02:47.560> all<00:02:47.680> our<00:02:47.770> players<00:02:48.010> maybe<00:02:48.370> I

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
can't spawn all our players maybe I

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.700 
can't spawn all our players maybe I
guess<00:02:48.700> you<00:02:48.820> can<00:02:48.940> spawn<00:02:49.150> on<00:02:49.300> on<00:02:49.660> a<00:02:49.720> spawn<00:02:50.530> beacon

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
guess you can spawn on on a spawn beacon

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.040 
guess you can spawn on on a spawn beacon
with<00:02:50.950> a<00:02:50.980> recon<00:02:51.370> class<00:02:51.640> but<00:02:51.970> not<00:02:52.600> many<00:02:52.780> people

with a recon class but not many people

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.170 
with a recon class but not many people
run<00:02:53.200> recon<00:02:53.380> on<00:02:53.680> this<00:02:53.710> K<00:02:54.010> mode<00:02:54.220> so<00:02:54.940> you've<00:02:55.150> got

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
run recon on this K mode so you've got

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.660 
run recon on this K mode so you've got
to<00:02:55.390> run<00:02:55.540> all<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:56.080> way<00:02:56.110> from<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.740> deployment

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
to run all the way from the deployment

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.000 
to run all the way from the deployment

flag here and you too spawns and you
basically<00:03:39.250> meet<00:03:39.550> in<00:03:39.610> the<00:03:39.670> middle<00:03:39.760> here<00:03:39.910> and

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.350 
of trolling here in my own for a change
and<00:06:35.740> I<00:06:36.430> thought<00:06:36.640> well<00:06:36.850> let's<00:06:36.910> do

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 
and I thought well let's do

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.029 
and I thought well let's do
what<00:06:37.419> I<00:06:37.449> can<00:06:37.659> do<00:06:37.750> here<00:06:37.930> to<00:06:38.080> kind<00:06:38.259> of<00:06:38.349> get<00:06:38.949> the

00:06:57.749 --> 00:06:57.759 
there could be bailing out because you

00:06:57.759 --> 00:06:58.980 
there could be bailing out because you

00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:58.990 
know where the turrets pointed so you

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:00.450 
know where the turrets pointed so you
