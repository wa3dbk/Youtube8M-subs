00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.240 

the<00:00:51.270> most<00:00:51.600> efficient<00:00:52.200> way<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.380> capture<00:00:52.800> carbon

the most efficient way to capture carbon

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.760 
the most efficient way to capture carbon
dioxide<00:00:53.880> starts<00:00:54.600> with<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.810> process<00:00:55.140> called

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
dioxide starts with a process called

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.290 
dioxide starts with a process called
gasification<00:00:57.290> instead<00:00:58.290> of<00:00:58.440> burning<00:00:58.680> fuel

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
gasification instead of burning fuel

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.210 
gasification instead of burning fuel
gasification<00:01:00.300> creates<00:01:01.110> a<00:01:01.290> chemical<00:01:01.739> reaction

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
breaks everything down into molecules so

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.320 
breaks everything down into molecules so
you<00:01:19.350> can<00:01:19.619> capture<00:01:19.890> all<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.520> impurities<00:01:20.880> and

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
you can capture all the impurities and

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.770 
you can capture all the impurities and

a rock reservoir of sandstone and shale

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.780 
a rock reservoir of sandstone and shale
you<00:03:10.260> need<00:03:10.440> to<00:03:10.590> have<00:03:10.739> the<00:03:10.799> right<00:03:11.069> package<00:03:11.430> of

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
you need to have the right package of

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.089 
you need to have the right package of
rocks<00:03:12.090> in<00:03:12.450> order<00:03:12.690> to<00:03:12.870> be<00:03:13.049> able<00:03:13.140> to<00:03:13.440> store

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
rocks in order to be able to store

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:16.009

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
carbon dioxide in the subsurface so you

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:17.809 
carbon dioxide in the subsurface so you
need<00:03:16.319> to<00:03:16.500> have<00:03:16.620> sedimentary<00:03:17.250> rock<00:03:17.549> that's

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
need to have sedimentary rock that's

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.630 
need to have sedimentary rock that's
porous<00:03:18.540> that<00:03:18.780> has<00:03:18.959> space<00:03:19.590> between<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.340> the

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
porous that has space between the the

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.940 
porous that has space between the the
grains<00:03:20.940> that<00:03:21.120> make<00:03:21.420> up<00:03:21.569> that<00:03:21.720> rock<00:03:21.930> and<00:03:22.260> then

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
grains that make up that rock and then

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.500 
grains that make up that rock and then
another<00:03:23.220> rock<00:03:23.640> on<00:03:23.849> top<00:03:24.030> of<00:03:24.209> that<00:03:24.299> which

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
another rock on top of that which

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.710 
another rock on top of that which
essentially<00:03:24.900> acts<00:03:25.170> as<00:03:25.379> a<00:03:25.410> seal<00:03:26.180> so<00:03:27.180> this<00:03:27.420> is<00:03:27.569> an

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
essentially acts as a seal so this is an

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.020 
essentially acts as a seal so this is an
example<00:03:27.780> of<00:03:28.290> what<00:03:28.530> one<00:03:28.680> of<00:03:28.829> the<00:03:28.950> shield<00:03:29.250> seals

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
example of what one of the shield seals

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.720 
example of what one of the shield seals
looks<00:03:30.540> like<00:03:30.810> what<00:03:31.319> makes<00:03:31.530> it<00:03:31.709> a<00:03:31.769> good<00:03:32.010> seal<00:03:32.400> is

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
looks like what makes it a good seal is

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.150 
looks like what makes it a good seal is
that<00:03:33.030> it's<00:03:33.209> essentially<00:03:33.660> impermeable<00:03:34.440> so<00:03:35.010> the

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
that it's essentially impermeable so the

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.030 
that it's essentially impermeable so the
water<00:03:35.489> or<00:03:35.970> co2<00:03:36.540> trapped<00:03:37.139> beneath<00:03:37.349> it<00:03:37.799> won't

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
water or co2 trapped beneath it won't

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.970 
water or co2 trapped beneath it won't
pass<00:03:38.340> through<00:03:38.880> it<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.840> sandstone<00:03:40.560> is<00:03:40.620> made

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
pass through it the sandstone is made

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.069 
pass through it the sandstone is made
literally<00:03:41.400> of<00:03:41.790> lots<00:03:42.000> of<00:03:42.150> different<00:03:42.510> grains<00:03:42.840> of

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
literally of lots of different grains of

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.940 
literally of lots of different grains of
sand<00:03:43.349> so<00:03:44.160> you<00:03:44.250> can<00:03:44.519> see<00:03:44.880> that<00:03:45.180> that<00:03:45.720> water<00:03:46.349> drop

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
sand so you can see that that water drop

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.370 
sand so you can see that that water drop
is<00:03:47.190> actually<00:03:47.549> going<00:03:47.819> into<00:03:48.209> those<00:03:48.630> pore<00:03:49.049> spaces

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
is actually going into those pore spaces

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.770 
is actually going into those pore spaces
so<00:03:49.919> what<00:03:50.130> you're<00:03:50.280> really<00:03:50.310> looking<00:03:51.030> for<00:03:51.569> to

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
so what you're really looking for to

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.379 
so what you're really looking for to
safely<00:03:52.530> store<00:03:52.590> carbon<00:03:53.250> dioxide<00:03:53.760> is<00:03:53.910> a<00:03:53.940> package

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
safely store carbon dioxide is a package

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:57.050 
safely store carbon dioxide is a package
like<00:03:54.419> this<00:03:54.630> where<00:03:55.349> you<00:03:55.500> have<00:03:55.709> a<00:03:55.739> rock<00:03:56.099> beneath

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
like this where you have a rock beneath

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.110 
like this where you have a rock beneath
that<00:03:57.419> actually<00:03:57.930> has<00:03:58.169> a<00:03:58.410> pore<00:03:59.130> space<00:03:59.489> in<00:03:59.730> it<00:03:59.940> and

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
that actually has a pore space in it and

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.490 
that actually has a pore space in it and
a<00:04:00.450> rock<00:04:00.630> on<00:04:00.840> top<00:04:01.139> which<00:04:01.500> acts<00:04:01.769> as<00:04:01.980> that<00:04:02.250> seal

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
a rock on top which acts as that seal

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.200 
a rock on top which acts as that seal
one<00:04:05.130> of<00:04:05.250> the<00:04:05.370> first<00:04:05.670> large-scale
