00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
ones from the papal series it is a bit

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.169 
ones from the papal series it is a bit
disappointing<00:01:25.340> that<00:01:25.490> the<00:01:25.609> creators<00:01:25.999> of<00:01:26.060> the

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:26.179 
disappointing that the creators of the

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:28.059 
disappointing that the creators of the
figure<00:01:26.479> did<00:01:26.659> not<00:01:26.840> make<00:01:27.079> it<00:01:27.200> a<00:01:27.289> bit<00:01:27.439> more<00:01:27.649> detail

00:01:28.059 --> 00:01:28.069 
figure did not make it a bit more detail

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:31.989 
figure did not make it a bit more detail
given<00:01:29.060> the<00:01:29.179> size<00:01:29.450> of<00:01:29.659> the<00:01:29.719> figure<00:01:30.999> another

given the size of the figure another

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:33.910 
given the size of the figure another
somewhat<00:01:32.630> disappointing<00:01:33.289> part<00:01:33.560> of<00:01:33.770> the

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
somewhat disappointing part of the

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.279 
somewhat disappointing part of the
figure<00:01:34.219> is<00:01:34.369> that<00:01:34.429> the<00:01:34.789> teeth<00:01:35.090> just<00:01:35.359> look<00:01:35.990> plain

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:36.289 
figure is that the teeth just look plain

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:38.770 
figure is that the teeth just look plain
and<00:01:36.619> simple<00:01:37.130> with<00:01:37.549> a<00:01:37.579> mere<00:01:37.850> white<00:01:38.119> paint<00:01:38.509> job

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
and simple with a mere white paint job

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.399 
and simple with a mere white paint job

and not much more detail other problems

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.199 
and not much more detail other problems
found<00:01:42.590> with<00:01:42.799> the<00:01:42.920> figure<00:01:43.310> is<00:01:43.490> that<00:01:43.759> it<00:01:43.939> can<00:01:44.119> be

00:01:44.199 --> 00:01:44.209 
found with the figure is that it can be

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:46.899 
found with the figure is that it can be
difficult<00:01:44.450> to<00:01:44.929> make<00:01:45.049> it<00:01:45.229> stand<00:01:45.560> by<00:01:46.249> two<00:01:46.639> legs

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
difficult to make it stand by two legs

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.599 
difficult to make it stand by two legs
and<00:01:47.209> instead<00:01:47.780> the<00:01:48.109> tail<00:01:48.380> has<00:01:48.770> to<00:01:48.799> be<00:01:49.100> used<00:01:49.459> to

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:49.609 
and instead the tail has to be used to

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:51.449 
and instead the tail has to be used to
keep<00:01:49.789> it<00:01:49.909> from<00:01:50.060> falling<00:01:50.240> this<00:01:50.959> is<00:01:51.079> however

keep it from falling this is however

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:53.230 
keep it from falling this is however
understandable<00:01:52.459> given<00:01:52.850> that<00:01:53.030> this<00:01:53.179> was

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
understandable given that this was
