00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
is it's really gusty so probably not the

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.700 
can also see roughly where it was yeah
so<00:01:42.580> I<00:01:42.610> one<00:01:42.880> which<00:01:43.810> I've<00:01:43.960> got<00:01:44.140> here<00:01:44.350> this<00:01:44.470> is<00:01:44.680> the

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
so I one which I've got here this is the

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.250 
so I one which I've got here this is the
fire<00:01:45.100> the<00:01:45.490> main<00:01:45.670> front<00:01:45.940> and<00:01:46.540> towards<00:01:46.960> left<00:01:47.170> you

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
fire the main front and towards left you

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.160 
fire the main front and towards left you
can<00:01:47.440> see<00:01:48.450> spots<00:01:49.450> where<00:01:49.600> it<00:01:49.630> sort<00:01:49.780> of<00:01:49.870> began

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
can see spots where it sort of began

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.380 
can see spots where it sort of began
from<00:01:50.440> and<00:01:51.280> the<00:01:51.370> main<00:01:51.520> front<00:01:51.730> really<00:01:52.060> took<00:01:52.210> off

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
from and the main front really took off

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.810 
from and the main front really took off
I'm<00:01:52.750> not<00:01:53.530> sure<00:01:53.710> how<00:01:53.860> much<00:01:53.980> damage<00:01:54.220> is<00:01:54.490> done<00:01:54.700> at

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
I'm not sure how much damage is done at

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.970 
I'm not sure how much damage is done at
this<00:01:54.850> time<00:01:55.150> but<00:01:55.510> it<00:01:56.170> appeared<00:01:56.530> to<00:01:56.560> go<00:01:56.710> straight

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:56.980 
this time but it appeared to go straight

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.910 
this time but it appeared to go straight
past<00:01:57.270> was<00:01:58.270> running<00:01:58.510> parallel<00:01:58.750> to<00:01:58.990> UM<00:01:59.350> else<00:01:59.740> I

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
past was running parallel to UM else I

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.260 
past was running parallel to UM else I
bet<00:02:00.100> was<00:02:00.280> not<00:02:00.460> yeah<00:02:01.980> so<00:02:02.980> all<00:02:03.250> in<00:02:03.430> all<00:02:03.520> um<00:02:03.820> I

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
bet was not yeah so all in all um I

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.780 
bet was not yeah so all in all um I
think<00:02:04.840> the<00:02:04.900> fight<00:02:05.140> went<00:02:05.380> quite<00:02:05.590> well<00:02:05.770> it<00:02:06.580> was

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
think the fight went quite well it was

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.630 
think the fight went quite well it was
only<00:02:06.940> a<00:02:07.030> short<00:02:07.300> fight<00:02:07.570> and<00:02:07.930> we<00:02:08.709> basically<00:02:09.280> just

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
only a short fight and we basically just

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.430 
only a short fight and we basically just
got<00:02:09.910> the<00:02:10.030> aircraft<00:02:10.330> up<00:02:10.479> there<00:02:10.690> and<00:02:10.780> Thomas<00:02:11.080> FP

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
got the aircraft up there and Thomas FP

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.740 
got the aircraft up there and Thomas FP
bed<00:02:11.620> around<00:02:11.769> there<00:02:12.300> didn't<00:02:13.300> venture<00:02:13.420> too<00:02:13.720> far

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
bed around there didn't venture too far

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.780 
bed around there didn't venture too far
