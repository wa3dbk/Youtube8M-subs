it<00:01:23.170> wasn't<00:01:24.160> agreeing<00:01:24.520> to<00:01:24.640> care<00:01:24.789> of<00:01:24.880> that<00:01:25.030> it

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
it wasn't agreeing to care of that it

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.820 
it wasn't agreeing to care of that it
was<00:01:25.300> a<00:01:25.330> smaller<00:01:25.750> version<00:01:25.990> I<00:01:26.320> had<00:01:26.470> a<00:01:26.500> trailer

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
was a smaller version I had a trailer

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.150 
was a smaller version I had a trailer
hitch<00:01:27.130> and<00:01:27.250> whatnot<00:01:27.610> but<00:01:28.229> my<00:01:29.229> point<00:01:29.500> is<00:01:29.649> that

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
hitch and whatnot but my point is that

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.180 
hitch and whatnot but my point is that
the<00:01:30.310> engine<00:01:30.729> was<00:01:31.000> real<00:01:31.300> tiny<00:01:31.720> in<00:01:32.320> that<00:01:32.740> and

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
the engine was real tiny in that and

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.279 
the engine was real tiny in that and
then<00:01:33.580> after<00:01:33.970> we<00:01:34.360> got<00:01:34.479> rid<00:01:34.539> of<00:01:34.690> that<00:01:34.929> we<00:01:35.080> bought

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:35.289 
then after we got rid of that we bought

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:38.940 
then after we got rid of that we bought
this<00:01:35.560> of<00:01:36.009> course<00:01:36.670> we<00:01:36.880> still<00:01:37.179> do<00:01:37.360> have<00:01:37.600> that<00:01:37.950> we

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
this of course we still do have that we

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.040 
this of course we still do have that we
don't<00:01:39.100> anymore<00:01:39.369> we<00:01:39.670> sold<00:01:39.910> a<00:01:40.000> few<00:01:40.240> days<00:01:40.420> ago<00:01:40.630> but

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
don't anymore we sold a few days ago but

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.830 
don't anymore we sold a few days ago but
I<00:01:41.320> would<00:01:42.250> show<00:01:42.759> you<00:01:42.820> the<00:01:43.000> engine<00:01:43.240> in<00:01:43.390> that<00:01:43.570> too

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
I would show you the engine in that too

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:52.620 
I would show you the engine in that too
but<00:01:44.640> this<00:01:45.640> engine<00:01:46.090> is<00:01:46.240> huge<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:50.160> it<00:01:51.160> goes<00:01:51.630> 143

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
but this engine is huge and it goes 143

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.609 
but this engine is huge and it goes 143
and<00:01:54.450> surprisingly<00:01:55.450> it<00:01:55.660> isn't<00:01:55.929> a<00:01:55.959> minivan<00:01:56.259> so

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
and surprisingly it isn't a minivan so

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:03.290 
and surprisingly it isn't a minivan so
that's<00:01:57.580> why<00:01:57.880> it<00:01:57.940> doesn't<00:01:58.390> go<00:01:58.590> 160<00:01:59.590> but<00:02:01.440> you<00:02:02.440> got

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
that's why it doesn't go 160 but you got

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.370 
that's why it doesn't go 160 but you got
you<00:02:04.300> can't<00:02:04.539> really<00:02:04.690> see<00:02:04.929> because<00:02:04.989> I<00:02:05.229> don't

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
you can't really see because I don't

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.960 
you can't really see because I don't
