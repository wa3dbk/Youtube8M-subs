00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
thought I think so but my idea was take

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.310 
thought I think so but my idea was take
and<00:05:36.710> then<00:05:37.670> this<00:05:37.850> one<00:05:37.910> I<00:05:38.360> don't<00:05:38.810> see<00:05:39.050> how<00:05:39.170> it

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
and then this one I don't see how it

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.130 
and then this one I don't see how it
prevents<00:05:39.800> the<00:05:39.950> major<00:05:40.220> there<00:05:40.610> is<00:05:40.700> no<00:05:40.910> way<00:05:41.140> rook

time management of the other place I

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.020 
time management of the other place I
mean<00:06:02.390> but<00:06:03.110> sometimes<00:06:03.500> it's<00:06:04.070> really<00:06:04.400> helpful

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:05.030 
mean but sometimes it's really helpful

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.230 
mean but sometimes it's really helpful
if<00:06:05.300> you<00:06:05.480> think<00:06:05.930> a<00:06:06.020> bit<00:06:06.580> for<00:06:07.580> some<00:06:07.610> reason<00:06:08.150> I

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 
if you think a bit for some reason I

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.920 
if you think a bit for some reason I
cannot<00:06:08.710> take<00:06:09.710> the<00:06:09.920> moves<00:06:10.100> back<00:06:10.460> when<00:06:11.390> one<00:06:11.720> can

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.930 
cannot take the moves back when one can

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:20.409 
cannot take the moves back when one can
I<00:06:12.050> do<00:06:12.110> that<00:06:12.940> strange

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:20.419 

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:28.309 

so<00:06:21.419> I<00:06:21.449> cannot<00:06:23.569> make<00:06:24.569> up<00:06:24.810> moves<00:06:26.900> this<00:06:27.900> is<00:06:28.080> weird

00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:28.319 
so I cannot make up moves this is weird

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:31.909 
so I cannot make up moves this is weird
yeah<00:06:29.099> well<00:06:29.279> anyway<00:06:29.430> the<00:06:30.150> thing<00:06:30.389> is<00:06:30.599> here<00:06:31.499> he

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 
yeah well anyway the thing is here he

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:33.769 
yeah well anyway the thing is here he
needs<00:06:32.159> to<00:06:32.310> play<00:06:32.550> something<00:06:33.060> else<00:06:33.180> I'm<00:06:33.599> not

00:06:33.769 --> 00:06:33.779 
needs to play something else I'm not

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:37.420 
needs to play something else I'm not
sure<00:06:34.099> maybe<00:06:35.099> a<00:06:35.310> rook<00:06:36.120> rook<00:06:36.449> rook<00:06:36.779> somewhere

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:37.430 
sure maybe a rook rook rook somewhere

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.040 
sure maybe a rook rook rook somewhere
and<00:06:38.430> the<00:06:38.580> comp<00:06:38.849> actually<00:06:39.300> gives<00:06:39.479> me<00:06:39.659> a<00:06:39.689> winning

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.050 
and the comp actually gives me a winning

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.110 
and the comp actually gives me a winning
position<00:06:40.199> already<00:06:40.620> I<00:06:41.039> mean<00:06:41.669> I<00:06:41.759> was<00:06:41.909> optimistic
