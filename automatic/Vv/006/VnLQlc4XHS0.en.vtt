00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
you guys not know what a charged creeper

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.899 
you guys not know what a charged creeper
is<00:01:10.280> well<00:01:10.670> basically<00:01:11.390> they<00:01:12.170> are<00:01:12.200> a<00:01:12.920> more

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
is well basically they are a more

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:16.120 
is well basically they are a more
dangerous<00:01:14.210> version<00:01:15.049> of<00:01:15.140> a<00:01:15.289> regular<00:01:15.530> creeper

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
dangerous version of a regular creeper

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.440 
dangerous version of a regular creeper
as<00:01:16.420> they<00:01:17.420> have<00:01:17.869> double<00:01:18.499> the<00:01:18.530> damage<00:01:18.770> I<00:01:19.450> think

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
as they have double the damage I think

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.649 
as they have double the damage I think
they<00:01:20.539> have<00:01:20.570> double<00:01:21.170> everything<00:01:21.710> except<00:01:22.159> for

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
they have double everything except for

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.069 
they have double everything except for
the<00:01:23.679> movement<00:01:24.679> speed<00:01:25.359> but<00:01:26.359> they<00:01:26.539> actually<00:01:26.719> I

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:27.079 
the movement speed but they actually I

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:29.830 
the movement speed but they actually I
think<00:01:27.170> have<00:01:27.590> a<00:01:27.619> higher<00:01:28.159> radius<00:01:28.850> of<00:01:29.060> explosion

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
think have a higher radius of explosion

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.279 
think have a higher radius of explosion
so<00:01:30.619> you<00:01:30.950> need<00:01:31.100> to<00:01:31.249> walk<00:01:31.630> instead<00:01:32.630> of<00:01:32.840> walking

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
so you need to walk instead of walking

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:36.219 
so you need to walk instead of walking
to<00:01:33.950> three<00:01:34.280> blocks<00:01:34.609> as<00:01:35.030> a<00:01:35.090> regular<00:01:35.600> creeper<00:01:35.990> so

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
to three blocks as a regular creeper so

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.279 
to three blocks as a regular creeper so
they<00:01:36.409> stop<00:01:36.920> exploding<00:01:37.729> from<00:01:38.270> so<00:01:38.719> you<00:01:38.780> can<00:01:39.020> stop

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
they stop exploding from so you can stop

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:41.440 
they stop exploding from so you can stop
them<00:01:39.469> from<00:01:39.590> exploding<00:01:40.100> you<00:01:40.670> actually<00:01:41.119> need<00:01:41.299> to

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
them from exploding you actually need to

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.980 
them from exploding you actually need to
walk<00:01:41.749> farther<00:01:42.670> because<00:01:43.670> the<00:01:43.939> radius<00:01:44.299> is<00:01:44.539> super

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
walk farther because the radius is super

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.800 
walk farther because the radius is super
big<00:01:46.329> also<00:01:47.329> the<00:01:47.719> explosion<00:01:48.649> is<00:01:49.569> huge<00:01:50.569> you<00:01:50.780> know

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
big also the explosion is huge you know

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.669 
big also the explosion is huge you know
uh<00:01:51.109> let's<00:01:52.009> uh<00:01:52.280> actually<00:01:52.909> show<00:01:53.389> you<00:01:53.450> a<00:01:53.689> creeper

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.390

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
you have a diamond diamond armor I think

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.930
