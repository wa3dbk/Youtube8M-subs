you<00:01:02.269> need<00:01:02.420> to<00:01:02.510> be<00:01:02.629> able<00:01:02.690> to<00:01:02.839> look<00:01:03.019> far<00:01:03.440> enough

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
you need to be able to look far enough

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.000 
you need to be able to look far enough
and<00:01:04.330> especially<00:01:05.330> see<00:01:05.540> if<00:01:05.600> these<00:01:05.810> rocks<00:01:06.200> or<00:01:06.560> dig

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
and especially see if these rocks or dig

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.940 
and especially see if these rocks or dig
cracking<00:01:07.340> bumps<00:01:07.700> or<00:01:08.180> acceleration<00:01:08.780> bumps<00:01:09.140> why

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
cracking bumps or acceleration bumps why

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.060 
cracking bumps or acceleration bumps why
because<00:01:10.520> wherever<00:01:10.909> you<00:01:11.119> look<00:01:11.479> at<00:01:11.770> it's<00:01:12.770> where

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
because wherever you look at it's where

you know acceleration bumps what you

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.419 
you know acceleration bumps what you
need<00:01:23.780> to<00:01:23.869> do<00:01:24.020> is<00:01:24.200> try<00:01:24.649> to<00:01:24.740> look<00:01:24.920> at<00:01:25.039> the<00:01:25.159> top<00:01:25.399> of
