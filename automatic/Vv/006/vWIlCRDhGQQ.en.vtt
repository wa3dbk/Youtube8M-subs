for the last at least 25 if not more
years<00:00:52.600> I<00:00:53.400> work<00:00:54.400> in<00:00:54.790> some<00:00:55.690> great<00:00:55.930> detail<00:00:56.530> as

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:56.830 
years I work in some great detail as

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.040 
years I work in some great detail as
establishing<00:00:57.550> how<00:00:58.000> these<00:00:58.360> buildings<00:00:58.870> are

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
establishing how these buildings are

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:22.490 
establishing how these buildings are
made

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.340 

not<00:01:23.500> story<00:01:24.219> so<00:01:25.149> I<00:01:25.180> don't<00:01:25.539> like<00:01:25.810> to<00:01:25.840> attach

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
not story so I don't like to attach

not story so I don't like to attach
dates<00:01:26.799> buildings<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:29.170> buildings<00:01:29.679> I've

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
dates buildings the buildings I've

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.090 
dates buildings the buildings I've
worked<00:01:30.340> on<00:01:30.659> definitely<00:01:31.659> go<00:01:31.869> back<00:01:31.899> to<00:01:32.289> 200<00:01:32.829> 300

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
worked on definitely go back to 200 300

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.929 
worked on definitely go back to 200 300
and<00:01:33.640> some<00:01:33.939> more<00:01:34.630> years<00:01:35.020> but<00:01:35.530> we<00:01:36.460> know<00:01:36.640> for<00:01:36.880> a

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
and some more years but we know for a

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:38.399 
and some more years but we know for a
fact<00:01:37.000> that<00:01:37.360> these<00:01:37.450> buildings<00:01:38.170> have<00:01:38.289> been

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
fact that these buildings have been

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.219 
fact that these buildings have been
there<00:01:38.860> since<00:01:39.130> pre<00:01:39.399> Islam<00:01:39.789> so<00:01:40.780> we're<00:01:41.020> talking

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
there since pre Islam so we're talking

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.090 
there since pre Islam so we're talking
of<00:01:41.789> civilizations<00:01:42.789> is<00:01:43.000> oldest<00:01:43.479> ever<00:01:44.069> queen<00:01:45.069> of

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
of civilizations is oldest ever queen of

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.029 
of civilizations is oldest ever queen of
sheba<00:01:45.780> then<00:01:46.780> I<00:01:46.899> think<00:01:47.229> if<00:01:47.469> you<00:01:47.649> go<00:01:47.679> back<00:01:47.979> to

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039 
sheba then I think if you go back to

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:50.999 
sheba then I think if you go back to
Genesis<00:01:48.729> you<00:01:49.060> find<00:01:49.420> the<00:01:49.539> mention<00:01:49.990> of<00:01:50.140> both

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
Genesis you find the mention of both

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.620 
Genesis you find the mention of both
Saddam<00:01:51.939> and<00:01:52.270> taline<00:01:52.659> and<00:01:52.959> had<00:01:53.200> a<00:01:53.229> role<00:01:53.619> in<00:01:54.630> the

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
Saddam and taline and had a role in the

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.149 
Saddam and taline and had a role in the
Torah

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.569 

now<00:01:59.729> how<00:01:59.969> is<00:02:00.960> extremely<00:02:01.710> complex<00:02:02.219> because

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
now how is extremely complex because

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.380 
now how is extremely complex because
Yemen's<00:02:03.149> one<00:02:03.420> who<00:02:03.600> most<00:02:03.869> sophisticated

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
Yemen's one who most sophisticated

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.419 
Yemen's one who most sophisticated
civilizations<00:02:06.390> has<00:02:06.899> maintained<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.770> continued

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
civilizations has maintained a continued

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.500 
civilizations has maintained a continued
to<00:02:08.819> construct<00:02:09.649> buildings<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:11.510> excited

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
to construct buildings and excited

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.070 
to construct buildings and excited
picture<00:02:12.959> with<00:02:13.560> these<00:02:13.769> materials<00:02:14.900> when<00:02:15.900> you've

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
picture with these materials when you've

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.780 
picture with these materials when you've
got<00:02:16.230> seven<00:02:16.680> eight<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.160> nine<00:02:17.250> floors

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
got seven eight and nine floors

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.570 
got seven eight and nine floors
constructed<00:02:18.690> in<00:02:18.810> sun-dried<00:02:19.260> mud<00:02:19.319> brick<00:02:19.620> it's

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
constructed in sun-dried mud brick it's

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.839 
constructed in sun-dried mud brick it's
already<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.209> huge<00:02:21.599> feet<00:02:22.230> both<00:02:22.650> engineering<00:02:23.400> Li

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
already a huge feet both engineering Li

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.809 
already a huge feet both engineering Li
and<00:02:24.230> construction<00:02:25.230> wise<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:25.890> when<00:02:26.489> it<00:02:26.610> comes

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
and construction wise and when it comes

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:58.410 
and construction wise and when it comes
to<00:02:27.150> design<00:02:27.569> it's<00:02:27.870> superior

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.849 

so<00:02:59.420> you<00:02:59.480> know<00:02:59.870> whether<00:03:00.109> you<00:03:00.349> construct

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:00.859 
so you know whether you construct

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:04.300 
so you know whether you construct
palaces<00:03:01.549> in<00:03:01.879> sun-dried<00:03:02.540> mud<00:03:02.599> brick<00:03:02.930> and<00:03:03.469> build

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
palaces in sun-dried mud brick and build

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.720 
palaces in sun-dried mud brick and build
up<00:03:04.640> to<00:03:04.849> 40<00:03:05.329> rooms<00:03:05.569> and<00:03:06.019> 40<00:03:06.469> bathrooms<00:03:07.040> in<00:03:07.430> one

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
up to 40 rooms and 40 bathrooms in one

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.229 
up to 40 rooms and 40 bathrooms in one
building<00:03:08.030> as<00:03:08.510> a<00:03:08.959> failure<00:03:09.439> for<00:03:09.739> example<00:03:10.459> one

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
building as a failure for example one

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.009 
building as a failure for example one
just<00:03:11.510> used<00:03:11.780> to<00:03:11.959> look<00:03:12.140> and<00:03:12.379> see<00:03:12.620> you<00:03:13.569> know<00:03:14.569> why

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
just used to look and see you know why

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.339 
just used to look and see you know why
what<00:03:15.650> has<00:03:15.950> made<00:03:16.189> this<00:03:16.579> so<00:03:17.569> incredible<00:03:18.260> and

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:18.349 
what has made this so incredible and

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:38.330 
what has made this so incredible and
amazing

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.699 

do<00:03:38.879> you<00:03:38.940> know<00:03:39.060> something<00:03:39.420> apart<00:03:40.170> from<00:03:40.319> trying

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
do you know something apart from trying

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.680 
do you know something apart from trying
to<00:03:40.890> be<00:03:41.010> philosophical<00:03:41.910> or<00:03:42.090> sounding

hundreds of years for its inhabitants

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.089 
hundreds of years for its inhabitants
and<00:03:53.690> it's<00:03:54.690> an<00:03:54.870> architecture<00:03:55.650> that<00:03:55.680> can
