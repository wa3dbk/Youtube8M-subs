00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.450
 Hello dear friends, we continue 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.980
 pass our epic passing 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:23.240
 goblin j next level us 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:30.519
 collapsed towers here we need 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:34.400
 archers wall fights on goblin I have a couple 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:36.230
 this couple of giants means let's 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.559
 need to be released here 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:44.899
 and in older versions 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:46.100
 more precisely the old levels there were traps 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.680
 a bunch of traps 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:58.430
 then let's release one here 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:59.930
 giant okay and these archers later here 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:04.640
 like this, too, a couple 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:07.400
 fine here we have to what is no longer so 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:12.979
 let's once again there is no campaign 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:20.570
 Exactly, here it is, and why they do not notice that 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:27.079
 they licked so here we already broke 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:32.780
 so let's go where are you? oh well 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:38.439
 go means we need to break first 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:43.130
 here is this garbage honor release 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:49.969
 excellent release not remaining 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:55.119
 giant and two walls of wallpaper from excellent 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:55.119
 now we need to break this bullshit 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:04.649
 so now we have mortar shooting no 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:11.310
 great and again some archers great 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:14.720
 now we now need balls mean 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:20.930
 here release 1 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.930
 then 2 and 3 here 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.050
 so here 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.550
 as long as everything goes fine 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.490
 Here we have all all the balls in place except 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.490
 one 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.500
 few guns left 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:55.380
 so here we have no mortar but 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:03:03.480
 there were such here any constructions and 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:03.480
 these are all storages 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.200
 here we have the second star 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:20.020
 so that's left 3 4 even the vault 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:27.870
 Well, a little bit now I work there 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:27.870
 the truth is going to work a little 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:37.080
 although because he is the last level for 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:45.750
 on 0800 700000 as I can not remember 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:45.750
 it certainly is cool they are hopeless 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.050
 so here such a volley they go all 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:58.200
 we have all three stars 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:00.500
 overall so here's the composition of checks to new 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.500
 meeting
