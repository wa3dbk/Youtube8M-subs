00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
hello everyone this is HP's Skelly back

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.480 
hello everyone this is HP's Skelly back
in<00:00:04.410> with<00:00:04.589> another<00:00:04.830> video<00:00:05.100> and<00:00:05.629> this<00:00:06.629> time<00:00:06.690> it

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:07.490 
in with another video and this time it

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.740 
in with another video and this time it
is<00:00:08.900> transformers<00:00:09.900> age<00:00:10.110> of<00:00:10.860> extinction

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:11.750 
is transformers age of extinction

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.590 
is transformers age of extinction
Optimus<00:00:12.750> Prime

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.460 

so<00:00:18.600> here<00:00:18.780> we<00:00:18.930> have<00:00:19.110> Optimus<00:00:20.100> in<00:00:20.369> his<00:00:21.470> truck

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
so here we have Optimus in his truck

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:30.320 
so here we have Optimus in his truck
mode<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:23.240> I<00:00:25.250> tried<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:27.050> I<00:00:28.970> tried<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.060> make<00:00:30.180> him

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
mode and I tried to I tried to make him

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.210 
mode and I tried to I tried to make him
more<00:00:30.540> have<00:00:30.930> more<00:00:31.140> curves<00:00:31.770> and<00:00:32.360> less<00:00:33.360> rough

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
more have more curves and less rough

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.910 
more have more curves and less rough
then<00:00:35.220> he's<00:00:36.050> Peterbilt<00:00:37.050> counterpart<00:00:37.770> and

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
then he's Peterbilt counterpart and

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.270 
then he's Peterbilt counterpart and
other<00:00:38.250> movies<00:00:39.230> to<00:00:40.230> differentiate<00:00:40.800> him

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
other movies to differentiate him

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.160 
other movies to differentiate him
so<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.550> wasn't<00:00:41.699> basically<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.300> same<00:00:42.480> thing<00:00:43.050> I

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
so it wasn't basically the same thing I

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.450 
so it wasn't basically the same thing I
had<00:00:43.290> made

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
had made

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.719 
had made
they<00:00:44.910> gigas<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.480> few<00:00:45.690> months<00:00:45.930> ago<00:00:46.790> I<00:00:49.309> think<00:00:50.309> I

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:50.729 
they gigas a few months ago I think I

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:53.450 
they gigas a few months ago I think I
mostly<00:00:51.479> focused<00:00:52.080> on<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.320> robot<00:00:52.949> mode<00:00:53.100> making

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
mostly focused on the robot mode making

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.719 
mostly focused on the robot mode making
it<00:00:53.729> cool<00:00:54.479> because<00:00:55.350> that's<00:00:55.650> how<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:55.920> usually<00:00:56.309> put

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:56.729 
it cool because that's how I usually put

00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:01.070 
it cool because that's how I usually put
him<00:00:56.820> on<00:00:57.120> my<00:00:57.449> little<00:00:57.690> shelf<00:00:58.589> whatever<00:00:59.900> but<00:01:00.900> I

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.080 
him on my little shelf whatever but I

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.000 
him on my little shelf whatever but I
also<00:01:01.320> worked<00:01:01.650> on<00:01:01.799> some<00:01:01.860> this<00:01:03.739> vehicle<00:01:04.739> mode<00:01:04.890> as

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
also worked on some this vehicle mode as

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
also worked on some this vehicle mode as
well<00:01:07.670> you<00:01:08.670> can<00:01:08.850> see<00:01:09.530> Kai<00:01:10.530> actually<00:01:11.520> looks<00:01:11.790> like

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
well you can see Kai actually looks like

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.719 
well you can see Kai actually looks like
his<00:01:12.299> prime<00:01:12.750> version<00:01:13.260> but<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.650> did<00:01:14.250> try<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.520> make

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
his prime version but I did try to make

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.859 
his prime version but I did try to make
him<00:01:14.880> look<00:01:14.970> like<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.180> Westminister<00:01:16.490> truck<00:01:17.869> 6

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
him look like the Westminister truck 6

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.219 
him look like the Westminister truck 6
wheels<00:01:20.659> he's<00:01:21.659> more<00:01:21.899> of<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.079> longer<00:01:22.729> profile

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
wheels he's more of a longer profile

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.649 
wheels he's more of a longer profile
Palmer<00:01:25.229> bulky<00:01:25.770> then<00:01:26.460> these<00:01:26.729> other<00:01:26.909> one<00:01:27.180> has

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
Palmer bulky then these other one has

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.560 
Palmer bulky then these other one has
the<00:01:27.930> wind<00:01:28.320> vane<00:01:28.560> more<00:01:29.490> accentuated<00:01:29.820> in<00:01:30.390> this

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
the wind vane more accentuated in this

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.999 
the wind vane more accentuated in this
version<00:01:32.750> because<00:01:33.750> in<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.500> different<00:01:34.770> truck

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
version because in a different truck

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.719 
version because in a different truck
entirely<00:01:35.579> than<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.090> first<00:01:37.049> three<00:01:37.259> movies<00:01:37.729> and

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
entirely than the first three movies and

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.109 
entirely than the first three movies and
I<00:01:39.600> actually<00:01:39.750> do<00:01:40.109> love<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:41.520> Western<00:01:41.880> Star

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
I actually do love of the Western Star

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.099 
I actually do love of the Western Star
more<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.359> think<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:43.020> like<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.469> it<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:45.109> vehicle

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:46.109 
more I think I like it it is a vehicle

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:48.230 
more I think I like it it is a vehicle
mode<00:01:46.340> better<00:01:47.340> than<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.640> Pierre<00:01:47.850> belt<00:01:48.090> because

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
mode better than the Pierre belt because

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.660 
mode better than the Pierre belt because
it's<00:01:48.359> more<00:01:48.630> be<00:01:48.929> it's<00:01:49.170> more<00:01:49.409> bulky<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.159> big<00:01:50.189> and

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
it's more be it's more bulky and big and

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.200 
it's more be it's more bulky and big and
I<00:01:51.539> think<00:01:51.960> Optimus<00:01:52.770> should<00:01:52.979> be<00:01:53.100> just<00:01:53.340> this<00:01:53.490> big

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
I think Optimus should be just this big

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.679 
I think Optimus should be just this big
brute<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:55.850> beheads<00:01:56.850> people<00:01:59.210> so<00:02:00.210> yes<00:02:00.359> and

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
brute that beheads people so yes and

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:01.999 
brute that beheads people so yes and
it's<00:02:00.899> thought<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.319> also<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:01.770> was<00:02:01.859> a<00:02:01.890> lot

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
it's thought and also it was a lot

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.690 
it's thought and also it was a lot
easier<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.429> create<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.679> bulky<00:02:04.679> robot<00:02:05.039> with<00:02:05.280> a

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
easier to create a bulky robot with a

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.390 
easier to create a bulky robot with a
bigger<00:02:06.299> truck<00:02:06.659> which<00:02:07.530> was<00:02:07.679> helpful<00:02:09.319> so<00:02:10.400> now

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
bigger truck which was helpful so now

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.150 
bigger truck which was helpful so now
that<00:02:11.460> we've<00:02:11.730> gotten<00:02:12.030> over<00:02:12.660> his<00:02:13.080> raw<00:02:13.920> mode

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
that we've gotten over his raw mode

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.430 
that we've gotten over his raw mode
let's<00:02:14.460> get<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:15.050> easy<00:02:16.050> transformation<00:02:17.840> so<00:02:18.840> for

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
let's get to easy transformation so for

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.590 
let's get to easy transformation so for
the<00:02:19.530> transformation<00:02:20.400> what<00:02:21.300> we're<00:02:21.480> gonna

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
the transformation what we're gonna

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.649 
the transformation what we're gonna
start<00:02:21.750> off<00:02:22.319> doing<00:02:22.860> is<00:02:23.209> turning<00:02:24.209> them<00:02:24.390> upside

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
start off doing is turning them upside

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.380 
start off doing is turning them upside
down<00:02:24.950> and<00:02:25.950> basically<00:02:26.730> there's<00:02:27.030> nothing<00:02:27.299> not

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
down and basically there's nothing not

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.820 
down and basically there's nothing not
much<00:02:27.540> of<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.780> legs<00:02:28.019> you<00:02:28.260> just<00:02:28.349> kind<00:02:28.590> of<00:02:28.620> split

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
much of the legs you just kind of split

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:29.610 
much of the legs you just kind of split
them<00:02:29.010> in<00:02:29.099> half<00:02:29.129> and

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
them in half and

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.699 
them in half and
I<00:02:29.680> pull<00:02:30.459> up<00:02:30.610> these<00:02:31.030> bits<00:02:31.450> and<00:02:32.819> skirts<00:02:34.709> then

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
I pull up these bits and skirts then

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.559 
I pull up these bits and skirts then
what<00:02:35.799> you're<00:02:35.920> going<00:02:36.010> to<00:02:36.069> do<00:02:36.250> is<00:02:36.519> uh<00:02:36.549> go<00:02:37.090> float

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
what you're going to do is uh go float

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.759 
what you're going to do is uh go float
that<00:02:37.720> back<00:02:38.019> Marius<00:02:39.010> oops<00:02:39.580> actually<00:02:40.769> we're

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
that back Marius oops actually we're

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.759 
that back Marius oops actually we're
gonna<00:02:41.920> split<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:43.150> back<00:02:43.409> section<00:02:44.409> of<00:02:44.709> the

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
gonna split the back section of the

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.869 
gonna split the back section of the
truck<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:47.530> it's<00:02:47.860> gonna<00:02:48.040> be<00:02:48.159> formed<00:02:48.519> the<00:02:48.610> arms

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 
truck and it's gonna be formed the arms

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:52.800 
truck and it's gonna be formed the arms
so<00:02:49.090> just<00:02:49.390> unfold<00:02:50.349> them<00:02:51.090> put<00:02:52.090> that<00:02:52.150> down<00:02:52.450> and

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
so just unfold them put that down and
