00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.770
 now we talk 

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.770
 to me 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.080
 What's up with kids here General I 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.150
 I bring a video to show us both 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.480
 new hidden advantages that there are with the 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.790
 latest update of black ops 2 that 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.529
 it was recently updated and have 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.330
 put two new advantages apart from the 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.190
 that they had already although those that had 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.260
 now the channel was going up but good 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.330
 I will upload if you tell me in the comments 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.180
 do it and the first advantage is the 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.180
 titan the permanent mini titan you see that 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.770
 dead of two touches 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.200
 the permanent titan we would have to 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.270
 buy us squeeze reveille leave us 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.890
 die shot and down as such 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.530
 as I do it and you see that some 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.940
 green balls you have seen that 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.700
 it means that they have already given us the 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.010
 permanent titan you see that they give me a 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.140
 touch two touches and they do not kill me like 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.170
 before we died, only two 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.809
 touches is one two three and I'm red or 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.980
 whether he would die on the fourth touch or 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:01.059
 that this would be one of the new 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.010
 advantages that they have put with the 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:06.490
 update for what is the mode 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.310
 transit and is I call it the Titan 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.729
 Mini permanent titan the titan 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.800
 second advantage would be the red skull 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.460
 that surely you have heard it 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.920
 there and to get it out here in the video 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.810
 not recorded I can not record as it has 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:28.149
 taken out but now I have and what there is to 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:29.890
 do is take the skull and not 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.020
 kill any zombie during the round 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.550
 until the skull goes and then the 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.960
 same person who has caught the first 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.640
 skull 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.050
 and has not killed anyone during a 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.120
 round has to get back the 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.490
 skull and in that moment when he takes it 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.820
 second time is when they give him the skull 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.820
 red 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.520
 you see here they are down there the time 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.180
 the normal skull and the skull come out 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.969
 red I said you have to take the 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.729
 Skull does not kill any zombie in all 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:02:00.399
 the round or until the 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.960
 skull and then get back the same 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:03.280
 person who had taken and that will be the 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.750
 that will have the advantage you see that the 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.179
 red skull serves to kill the 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.239
 zombies just by touching them with just touching 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:11.920
 what happens that goes away long before 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.470
 that the normal skull that's that of 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.060
 kill with one touch so nothing 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.230
 I hope you liked these two 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.810
 new advantages that there are with the 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.310
 update and nothing to upload another video 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.900
 explaining a couple of other things about 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.730
 update so nothing I hope that you 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.970
 have liked and see you in the next 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.970
 video
