00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.420 
I don't have a prepackaged cavity down
there<00:02:22.870> because<00:02:23.080> he's<00:02:23.230> not<00:02:23.500> gonna<00:02:23.920> be<00:02:24.160> able<00:02:24.280> to

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430

get back into this race he's a long way
behind<00:02:26.080> them<00:02:26.500> I<00:02:26.680> think<00:02:26.980> he<00:02:27.040> might<00:02:27.160> have<00:02:27.220> even

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400

dropped<00:02:27.670> back<00:02:27.730> to<00:02:27.940> fourth<00:02:28.120> in<00:02:28.300> DB<00:02:28.570> has<00:02:28.720> dropped
