00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.019
 and renewed 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:16.909
 this means that to conquer from this cut 

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:21.439
 is the same as that which existed millions of years ago when consumption was meager and 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:22.550
 mind - 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.550
 and sources of funding 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.450
 almost all of the water on the planet 97 and a half percent crash using the largest

 two-thirds we are at risk levels will be human because they are on glaciers 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:45.680
 snows 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.230
 so we are frozen 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.540

 groundwater park 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.590
 as the population grows 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.590
 less water available 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.570
 10% of existing water 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.689
 the industry absorbs 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:15.479
 21% of the total water and the agricultural sector is the largest user with 69 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.720
 but before securing food 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.830
 40% of this water is lost in the transport irrigation process 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.170
 while the population grows in geometric proportion the volume of 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.390
 water remains the same as the most serious 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:35.460
 each year 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.510
 decreases the volume of water available to humans 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.920
 after five years the world population corresponds to the 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.570
 3% of the local population 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.890
 in 2000 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.280
 the whole world used 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.719
 twice as much water as me 

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:52.980

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.200
 where is the largest sea clump 

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:16.719
 per thousand liters of water used by man 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.049

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.409
 of sub-20 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:24.559
 every year from 5 to 3 million people 

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:28.669
 dies as a result of the cross 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.289
 it is estimated that in 2050 

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:36.359
 4 billion people almost half the population of the planet 

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:41.309
 are living in countries with chronic drinking water shortages 

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:45.919
 in recent years the consumer has changed his behavior 

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:49.339
 is more than required by the toucan 

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:53.559
 the demand for better quality water that the consumer has led to companies like

00:02:56.249 --> 00:02:58.969

 including they begin to take away the dictators player 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:10.969

 water market 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.920
 is little explored, it seems more and more opportunities 

00:03:18.429 --> 00:03:23.289
 water is this century what oil was in the last century saw that 

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:24.159
