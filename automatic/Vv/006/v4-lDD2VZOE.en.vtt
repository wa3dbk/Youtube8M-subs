00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.400
Today is Sunday

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.080
It's time to prepare our meals for the week

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.980
No, wait! I'm not asking you to spend your entire Sunday cooking as if you were MasterChef

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.780
How's it going MasterChef?

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.500
But I believe you should prepare for success

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.540
You know when you wake up in the morning 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.180
You look at the closet still groggy...

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.940
'What am I wearing today?'

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.879
Then you realize you should have thought about that earlier and have it prepared

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It's the same with meals

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.260
I'll help you with that preparation for the week

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.860
Make it simple - that's the secret

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.080
Eating gourmet foods takes too long...let's be practical

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.960
Some ingredients can last almost a whole week

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.560
For example...boiling eggs. They're excellent snacks

00:00:53.740 --> 00:01:00.260
I boil about 10 and they last me almost a whole week. I take a few everyday and leave the rest in the fridge

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.280
Next...Brown Rice! This sh*t takes about 40 minutes to cook

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.120
It's terrible...so we cook it on Sunday in a big pot and I even put some peas and carrots in the mix

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.520
I used frozen for its convenience

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.360
Then the brown rice

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.640
A little salt, olive oil...and it's really tasty

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.900
I keep the whole pot in the fridge and use it whenever necessary

00:01:19.934 --> 00:01:21.494
It lasts for almost a whole week

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.080
Sweet potato

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.180
We can prepare it before hand, for example in the oven. I like to cut it thin...

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.900
A little garlic, salt...

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.220
But if you're short on time there's a quicker way

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.140
Microwave it! You just have to wash it first (with skin)

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.680
Stick a fork in it to make sure it cooks on the inside

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.780
Now wrap it with a paper napkin

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.820
As if it were a little piece of candy

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.360
And microwave it in the maximum potency

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.600
About 3 minutes should do it on the microwave

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.820
3 minutes Maximum power

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.620
It's done

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.200
So good...

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.060
Even the skin will peel off easy

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.080
You can even smash it with the fork and make a sort of mashed potato puree

00:02:37.354 --> 00:02:38.834
I won't even use salt

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.660
Meat or fish I like to cook the night before

00:02:48.894 --> 00:02:52.134
It's easier that way...sometimes I'll even use tuna cans for the convenience

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.240
Tomorrow that'll be the plan

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.040
Together with the brown rice

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.540
It's a big serving for lunch and I'll probably save a little to eat mid afternoon

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.720
Some hazelnuts...I'll even store a couple boiled eggs in the same Tupperware

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:21.809
All of this will fit in this isolation bag

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.140
I have fruit...I'll choose 2 pieces...

00:03:24.257 --> 00:03:26.557
An apple and a banana

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.120
And my day is pretty much done

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.100
My post workout protein shake ready to go...I'll just add water tomorrow

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:43.700
And..never forget water. A whole bottle that you should go through at least twice a day

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.960
Truth is you don't need to follow this regimen by the book

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.380
This is a mere suggestion

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.300
The portions will vary as well as the ingredients depending on the individual and the goals

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.720
But this is where we notice the difference between motivation and discipline...

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.140
This is discipline...get ready !

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.200
Is it that difficult?
