00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.150
 glowing screen 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:08.900
 expression is like any free 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.309
 space can be seen different 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.369
 sort of advertisement 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:14.669
 considering that on the roads 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:16.259
 over a billion cars 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:18.000
 no wonder someone 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 found a way to stick on advertising 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.089
 and on them 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:23.919
 but paint with paint 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:25.689
 not board the machine manually 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:28.569
 very expensive pleasure 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:31.569
 how is it done 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.250
 norwich england 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.810
 idyllic english 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.400
 cathedral city 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.950
 but we came here not to admire the views 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.110
 because at fifteen 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:46.429
 kilometers away from him 

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:48.639
 wanted located production of one 

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:49.689
 of the most famous british 

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:52.689
 sports cars 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.410
 lotos, founded in 1952 by racing drivers in 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.100
 leather chapman seven times became 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.550
 Formula 1 Championship Winner 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.540
 but she days they are more famous 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.100
 creating luxury sports cars 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.250
 his associations sich 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.180
 one of the fastest 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.190
 its aerodynamic shape and curved 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.180
 air intakes ideal for 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.180
 fast acceleration on race tracks 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.580
 but in the absence of any 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.720
 suitable flat surfaces 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.479
 drawing any image 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.430
 challenge of incredible complexity 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.670
 nevertheless the chief designer of the lotus 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.800
 Arch mailing chose exactly ex yush for 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.800
 patriotic coloring 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.619
 out of one wanted to portray that 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.770
 something like a developing flag one 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.030
 beds but i think it will give the car 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.810
 extra energy and mine 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.020
 children this unique quite unusual 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.670
 we haven't done this before 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.820
 moreover, he wants a new one 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.630
 the car was ready for demonstration 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.630
 after 24 hours 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:01.930
 fortunately at fifteen 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:02.619
 kilometers away 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:04.899
 Normal h is one of the largest 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:05.939
 worldwide design company 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.190
 cars 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.949
 in qatar secrets 

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:11.229
 The first problem that occurred is transmitted 

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:12.020
 designers 3 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.760
 thus a flat flag image 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.860
 union jack adjust to different 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.859
 manifestations of the surface of the machine 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:21.159
 designer mark sextant using 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:23.059
 three-dimensional wireframe images 

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:24.659
 car computer model 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:26.509
 experimenting with various 

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:28.839
 permutations until it finds a position 

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:31.339
 that fit under the screen outlines 

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:34.469
 locus 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:36.839
 now the design is ready for printing on 

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:38.120
 special places 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.120
 self adhesive vinyl film 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.310
 to figure out how to do it for him 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.420
 we went to one of the southern provinces 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.159
 Holland 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:51.739
 where is the factory of the Khazars slal 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.179
 blows yes and withdrawing anisina 

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:55.789
 november one of the biggest 

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:59.029
 the world of manufacturers of self-adhesive vinyl 

00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:00.769
 it all starts with incredible sizes 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.399
 rolls of fake paper 

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:06.399
 of the seven kilometer ferries 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:08.949
 they enter this huge 

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:10.559
 automatically unit 

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:12.809
 where a layer is applied to the coated paper 

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:15.809
 kuni bonding silicones 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:19.849
 entirely creates a surface which 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:23.249
 later make it easy to detach the canceled 

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:25.549
 then I pass it through the oven where he 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:26.629
 is drying 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:29.629
 before being covered with liquid glue 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:31.939
 plastic coating which is supplied 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:34.489
 on the right meets paper covered 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.339
 silicone glue served under the left 

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:39.859
 pressure they are tightly compressed in the end 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:42.619
 very sticky vinyl 

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:45.179
 in which can be easily separated from covered 

00:03:45.179 --> 00:03:48.179
 silicone backing 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:54.499
 but this vinyl must withstand harsh 

00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:57.369
 weather 

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:59.600
 samples thorough testing 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.300
 exposing to ultraviolet 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.710
 radiation and rush from sunlight 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.500
 adequate to many years of stay 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.500
 the sun 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:12.959
 he is also tested for strength so that he 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.889
 didn't tear too easily 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:17.479
 and on delamination determining evenness 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:19.749
 layers of glue made of silicone 

00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:21.949
 when the Jews get hurt that with their 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:23.720
 sticky vinyl all right 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.500
 material is ready for use 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.980
 car designers like 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.010
 adrian road 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.520
 and made up to trust 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.409
 what is normal h 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:34.659
 computer design is first divided into 

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:36.839
 three separate sections of the area of ​​two with 

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:38.659
 half square meters 

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:41.099
 then begins printing on a huge 

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:43.370
 inkjet printer 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.389
 since vinyl is very thin 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:47.319
 it is covered in many layers 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:50.319
 paints to get not transparent drawing 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:53.919
 after printing 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:55.749
 image is covered again 

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:56.879
 this time 

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:59.020
 plastic laminate for protection 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.279
 noted conditions 

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:03.279
 now there but ready to use 

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:07.399
 Now you can start the campaign 

00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:08.289
 born on registration 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:11.289
 the car 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:14.949
 the first task is to prepare the car 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:17.729
 removing all the extra details for callas 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:20.080
 broiler grille and even 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.099
 emblem 

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:25.520
 then will be thoroughly cleaned remove fat 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:28.099
 pieces of making duct tape 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:31.020
 placing the position of the vinyl flyers and 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.020
 can move a little to the side 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.610
 6 in satisfaction with the location of each 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.610
 sections they start them accounted for 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:44.219
 this should be done right away because 

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:46.830
 remove the plastic without tearing it incredibly 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.960
 difficult 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.080
 moreover the remaining air bubbles are not 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.560
 just spoil the look of the usa saves 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.340
 moisture due to which the coating 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.869
 may eventually peel off 

00:05:58.869 --> 00:06:00.459
 the problem is that flat sheets 

00:06:00.459 --> 00:06:03.149
 plastic do not want a smooth fairing 

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:05.449
 angles and contours of the machine 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:08.309
 if you pull them with your hands 

00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:10.409
 so for flexibility 

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:13.409
 the sheet and heat the heat gun 

00:06:15.619 --> 00:06:17.979
 when the first plastic sheet go to bed 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:21.639
 their places all the extra skillfully cut off with 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:24.639
 using a scalpel 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.169
 overtime 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:30.039
 lotus number is extremely important 

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:32.500
 cut very accurately and neatly so as not to 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.479
 not the slightest trace left 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:37.840
 done so that the knife does not apply 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.010
 no effort 

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.320
 practically only the weight of the knife itself is not 

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.820
 more so how can we take off everything 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.420
 superfluous and do not leave any paint on 

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.129
 traces 

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:51.300
 then they cover the plastic side 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.629
 machine carefully aligning the sheets 

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:54.800
 near the wings 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.800
 and wheeled niche 

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:01.869
 in six hours the car is ready 

00:07:01.869 --> 00:07:03.889
 but the problem is in the article 

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:05.830
 seeks to return to its original 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.199
 flat shape 

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:09.289
 so it got hot 

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:10.460
 degrees Celsius 

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.610
 so that plastic is used to its new 

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:14.499
 condition 

00:07:14.499 --> 00:07:16.879
 after returning to place all shot 

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:19.190
 parts machine carefully polishes 

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.190
 and this work is completed 

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:28.759
 the next day the car is returned 

00:07:29.409 --> 00:07:31.349
 village star star are going to check 

00:07:31.349 --> 00:07:34.349
 her abilities 

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:46.479
 for car decoration 

00:07:46.479 --> 00:07:49.479
 but what will it give to scarlet parties 

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:01.660
 I think this is a great car for the pilot. 

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:04.419
 star pleasure east of color 

00:08:04.419 --> 00:08:05.029
 scales 

00:08:05.029 --> 00:08:07.399
 and I am not afraid of any competitors 

00:08:07.399 --> 00:08:08.969
 british carmaker and 

00:08:08.969 --> 00:08:10.499
 maybe not much left 

00:08:10.499 --> 00:08:12.379
 at least the viewer will not 

00:08:12.379 --> 00:08:14.399
 no doubt where does this car come from
