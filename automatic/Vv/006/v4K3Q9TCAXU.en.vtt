 Hi YouTubes! Everyone who follows me on Facebook and Twitter 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.680
 I already saw that I was sick, but I still wanted to upload a new video today 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.000
 but I sound a bit strange so sorry for that. 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.640
 And thanks for all the sweet messages on my April Fools video because I was sick that day too 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.790
 so I was sleeping a lot and when I was awake I looked at the messages 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.020
 and you made me laugh so thanks for that! 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.740
 Today I'm going to show you the camouflage manicure so let's take a look at the tutorial! 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.140
 I start with OPI Did You Ear About Van Gogh 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.360
 This color is perfect as a basic color 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.120
 but a dusty green color would also look nice. 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.630
 This varnish needs two coats to be completely opaque. 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.770
 When I'm done I wait until the base color is dry. 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.560
 Now I use Deborah Milano Pret a Porter number 51 Khaki Green 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.140
 Use a dotting tool and make the first spots. 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:19.160
 You can make a few small ones, a few large ones, which you like best! 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.700
 This is OPI A Taupe The Space Needle 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.240
 Now we do exactly the same as the previous color 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.540
 It looks a bit like a turd but I promise you that it will look a lot better 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.360
 This is Green Generation 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.780
 Do not only apply the colors side by side, let them overlap a little. 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.320
 Make sure that you do not apply a light color over a dark color because then the color may change. 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.980
 If you want to test it first, you can do this on a piece of paper. 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.900
 Now it's time for black, I use number 71 Total Black 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.860
 This is the last color that I need. 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.120
 Freehand nail art always looks a bit lumpy 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.700
 But once you apply the topcoat, everything is nicely even again. 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.929
 I use my eyeliner brush to remove the nail polish I have spilled 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:11.010
 And now my favorite moment, topcoat time! Make sure you do not press too hard on your nail 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.410
 so keep the brush just above the nail and use enough topcoat 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.560
 We are done! This is the result! 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.040
 Thank you for looking and see you next time!
