00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
that he is just a basic prototype used

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.429 
that he is just a basic prototype used
to<00:01:27.240> show<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.509> interaction<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.320> the

I<00:01:31.619> still<00:01:32.250> stand<00:01:32.579> by<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:32.820> idea<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.329> he<00:01:33.659> is

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
I still stand by this idea that he is

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.120 
I still stand by this idea that he is
just<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.170> model<00:01:34.829> basic<00:01:35.610> beta<00:01:36.470> backup<00:01:37.470> prototype

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
of yellow Li dominance so a yellow

point<00:06:41.979> obviously<00:06:42.699> some<00:06:42.940> may<00:06:43.060> be<00:06:43.120> wrong<00:06:43.360> but

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:43.419 
point obviously some may be wrong but

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:44.670 
point obviously some may be wrong but
just<00:06:43.990> go<00:06:44.380> with<00:06:44.500> it

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 
just go with it

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:49.290 
just go with it
we<00:06:45.280> have<00:06:46.289> Olimar<00:06:47.289> Lurie<00:06:48.159> the<00:06:48.820> president

00:06:56.169 --> 00:06:59.240 
B point five character C and character D
so<00:06:56.889> what<00:06:57.190> does<00:06:57.279> that<00:06:57.310> come<00:06:57.550> to<00:06:57.700> in<00:06:57.789> total<00:06:58.150> nine

00:06:59.240 --> 00:06:59.250 
so what does that come to in total nine

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.560 
so what does that come to in total nine
nine<00:07:00.250> captain's<00:07:00.880> all<00:07:01.060> together

pink and including the characters color
schemes<00:07:13.570> cyan<00:07:14.500> so<00:07:15.250> what<00:07:15.400> does<00:07:15.490> that<00:07:15.520> come<00:07:15.820> to

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:16.030 
schemes cyan so what does that come to

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.990 
schemes cyan so what does that come to
nine<00:07:16.780> white<00:07:17.740> seem<00:07:18.040> to<00:07:18.160> be<00:07:18.280> the<00:07:18.400> only<00:07:18.580> color

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:19.000 
nine white seem to be the only color

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.570 
nine white seem to be the only color
unfulfilled<00:07:19.540> so<00:07:20.380> I<00:07:20.680> may<00:07:20.920> not<00:07:21.040> be<00:07:21.160> too<00:07:21.310> far<00:07:21.520> off

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:21.580 
unfulfilled so I may not be too far off

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:23.130 
unfulfilled so I may not be too far off
with<00:07:21.820> the<00:07:21.910> character<00:07:22.180> here<00:07:22.330> there<00:07:22.930> may<00:07:23.080> still

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:23.140 
with the character here there may still

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:24.840 
with the character here there may still
be<00:07:23.380> a<00:07:23.500> possibility<00:07:23.950> of<00:07:24.250> other<00:07:24.370> characters

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:24.850 
be a possibility of other characters

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:26.880 
be a possibility of other characters
being<00:07:25.090> part<00:07:25.390> of<00:07:25.510> Pikmin<00:07:25.810> 3<00:07:25.840> they<00:07:26.590> may<00:07:26.740> not

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:26.890 
being part of Pikmin 3 they may not

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:29.430 
being part of Pikmin 3 they may not
necessarily<00:07:27.040> be<00:07:27.460> playable<00:07:28.090> or<00:07:28.330> on<00:07:28.990> our<00:07:29.020> side

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:29.440 
necessarily be playable or on our side

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:34.830 
necessarily be playable or on our side
but<00:07:30.030> so<00:07:31.030> 9<00:07:31.960> captains<00:07:32.830> 9<00:07:33.460> Pikmin<00:07:33.940> possibly<00:07:34.690> more

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:34.840 
but so 9 captains 9 Pikmin possibly more

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:35.370 
but so 9 captains 9 Pikmin possibly more
to<00:07:34.990> come

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:35.380 
to come

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:36.990
