00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
that from a game that I thought would

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.759 
that from a game that I thought would
kind<00:03:08.820> of<00:03:08.880> just<00:03:08.940> be<00:03:09.270> you<00:03:09.900> know<00:03:10.020> a<00:03:10.050> side<00:03:10.410> project

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
of these comic legends and they were

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.150 
of these comic legends and they were
just<00:03:13.110> kind<00:03:13.380> of<00:03:13.410> throw<00:03:13.680> something<00:03:14.040> together

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
just kind of throw something together

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.540 
just kind of throw something together
this<00:03:15.030> game<00:03:15.590> really<00:03:16.590> has<00:03:16.980> a<00:03:17.010> lot<00:03:17.370> of<00:03:17.400> time

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
this game really has a lot of time

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.880 
this game really has a lot of time
effort<00:03:18.120> and<00:03:18.480> quality<00:03:19.140> put<00:03:19.350> into<00:03:19.590> it<00:03:19.620> and

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
effort and quality put into it and

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.250 
effort and quality put into it and
that's<00:03:20.280> really<00:03:20.670> what<00:03:21.300> you<00:03:21.360> want<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:21.840> see<00:03:22.019> when

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
that's really what you want to see when

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.750 
that's really what you want to see when
you<00:03:22.380> have<00:03:22.410> a<00:03:22.620> project<00:03:23.190> like<00:03:23.310> this<00:03:23.370> come

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
you have a project like this come

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.570 
you have a project like this come
together<00:03:23.910> so<00:03:24.630> overall<00:03:25.590> I<00:03:25.890> thought<00:03:26.400> that

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
together so overall I thought that

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.100 
together so overall I thought that
Ghostbusters<00:03:27.239> was<00:03:27.420> one<00:03:27.660> of<00:03:27.780> the<00:03:27.840> best<00:03:27.989> games

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
Ghostbusters was one of the best games

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.920 
Ghostbusters was one of the best games
of<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:28.500> year<00:03:28.530> for<00:03:28.920> sure<00:03:29.190> obviously<00:03:29.930> doesn't

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
of the year for sure obviously doesn't

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.110 
of the year for sure obviously doesn't
rank<00:03:31.140> as<00:03:31.320> epic<00:03:31.769> or<00:03:31.950> as<00:03:32.370> high<00:03:32.580> as<00:03:32.790> some<00:03:32.940> of<00:03:33.030> the

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
rank as epic or as high as some of the

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.880 
rank as epic or as high as some of the
other<00:03:33.300> games<00:03:33.630> that<00:03:33.750> were<00:03:33.959> on<00:03:34.110> there<00:03:34.350> but<00:03:34.800> it

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
other games that were on there but it

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.860 
other games that were on there but it
definitely<00:03:35.190> had<00:03:35.670> to<00:03:35.760> make<00:03:35.910> my<00:03:36.060> top<00:03:36.330> 10<00:03:36.600> being

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
definitely had to make my top 10 being

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.120 
definitely had to make my top 10 being
the<00:03:36.959> I've<00:03:37.110> been<00:03:37.290> such<00:03:37.500> a<00:03:37.530> long<00:03:37.860> time
