now the way this motor works is that

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.680 
now the way this motor works is that
there<00:00:58.450> is<00:00:58.600> a<00:00:58.720> Hall<00:00:58.960> effect<00:00:58.990> sensor<00:01:00.330> which<00:01:01.330> can

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
tell which pole is facing it therefore

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.830 
tell which pole is facing it therefore
it<00:01:07.360> can<00:01:07.720> tell<00:01:07.990> the<00:01:08.200> position<00:01:08.710> of<00:01:08.890> the<00:01:09.160> rotor

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
now this motor does have some startup

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.150 
now this motor does have some startup
issues<00:02:57.580> when<00:02:58.580> the<00:02:59.150> magnet<00:02:59.720> it's<00:03:00.560> just<00:03:00.920> in<00:03:01.070> the

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
issues when the magnet it's just in the

issues when the magnet it's just in the
right<00:03:01.370> position<00:03:02.030> and

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
right position and

of<00:03:03.209> these<00:03:03.420> coils

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:29.650 

are<00:03:06.430> to<00:03:06.549> rotate

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.920 

now<00:03:30.200> this<00:03:30.860> motor<00:03:31.190> has

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
now this motor has

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.020 
now this motor has
or<00:03:34.110> can't<00:03:34.470> produce<00:03:34.620> lots<00:03:35.519> of<00:03:35.700> rpm

or can't produce lots of rpm

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.470 
or can't produce lots of rpm
it<00:03:37.090> has<00:03:37.300> very<00:03:37.690> very<00:03:38.140> little<00:03:38.350> tour

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
it has very very little tour

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.630 
it has very very little tour
so<00:03:40.960> it's<00:03:41.170> not<00:03:41.380> very<00:03:41.560> good<00:03:41.680> at<00:03:42.040> driving<00:03:42.340> this

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
so it's not very good at driving this

00:03:42.640 --> 00:04:17.220 
so it's not very good at driving this
propeller<00:03:43.120> and<00:03:44.110> direct<00:03:44.380> drive
