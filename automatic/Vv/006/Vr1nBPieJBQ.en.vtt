00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:14.370
 hi everyone his vines is concentrating 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.080
 today for a new video 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.340
 hope you are fine 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.539
 personally it's going very well and 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.460
 today we find ourselves a month 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.869
 new unique concept it's my class 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.000
 of the moment so I will advise you 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.500
 a class my class that I prefer in 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.720
 this moment and suddenly like that you 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.039
 can try it at home and here I am 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.309
 think it's a pretty good project 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.680
 so already from a tear that n 94 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.780
 so I'll say a little bit why 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.500
 I took this weapon and how to play 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.610
 with and for what purpose are the 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.829
 accessories on this weapon 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.680
 and here I explained to you a little 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.719
 little all that already 2nd n 94 the catches 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.340
 because I have to ride girls 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.350
 gold assault to have all the 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.059
 assault rifles in diamonds this is it 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.390
 just for that I took it so 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.420
 I equipped 7 n 94 with a silencer of a 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.760
 adjustable butt and a guard and a 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.769
 hedgehog or a train station not a 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.650
 guy from me so i think the silent 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.869
 simply to be invisible to 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.180
 Radar Radar let's say it like that in 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.610
 visible to the radar cross adjustable for 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.830
 to have as if it was tracker regard of 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.650
 man for better accuracy 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.820
 so the muffler that allows you to be 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.259
 not visible on the radar as I you 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.810
 said and I find that she is 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.920
 far more powerful with the 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.409
 silent do not know why there 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.360
 it's like on a wolf the 3l mp7 was 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.799
 more powerful with a muffler and there 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.570
 I find that the n 94 most 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.270
 powerful with a silencer so I 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.070
 equipped with silencer for lacrosse 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.350
 adjustable bah I do not know why with 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.090
 the n 94 frankly it's good as 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.009
 it's a head assault rifle that 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.509
 move like on the submachine gun vein 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.250
 it may be better but frankly 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.530
 I like with the adjustable stick and 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.640
 it's an accessory that this concept that 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.189
 I advise everyone because he 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.200
 is really good and I keep my for 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.140
 the burned ong food so everything 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.640
 just how to play with 7 n 94 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.310
 it's more like defensive mode 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.189
 by auch and she is very powerful at 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.390
 melee level and by far so at the 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.439
 body-to-body level frankly she 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.020
 is very good but you still have to 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.880
 avoid making body to body worth 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.670
 better try to have by far 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.960
 he sees there is a little bit the assets 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.030
 194 is that it is very versatile 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.210
 from near or far in his way this 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.700
 short noise very very versatile up close 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.530
 or by far as I told you and that's it 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.020
 so I would advise you expensive 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.190
 to be on the defensive not too rock 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.290
 you can rock but that's it 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.970
 really hot against a ms mcm 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.470
 pgw monsters like that do not you do the 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.240
 weight unless the other opposite is not 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.710
 visible or are you in good faith 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.480
 and that you are very very responsive 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.590
 so here are the assets 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.790
 frankly you put what wanted 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.930
 the for this class 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.760
 I really have nothing I put you a 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.800
 little class in photo but frankly 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.540
 at the asset level it's useless 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.430
 did not copy at the level garnet mortals 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.720
 you just need to have a joker 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.820
 Mainly over-equipped 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.440
 so here I hope that the video you 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.330
 will have pleased and we may find ourselves 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.530
 for an upcoming video for my class 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.530
 from the world to later
