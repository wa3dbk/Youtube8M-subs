00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
new waterproof quadcopter frame that I

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.230 
new waterproof quadcopter frame that I
ordered<00:00:13.469> from<00:00:13.650> aqua<00:00:14.039> copters<00:00:14.430> so<00:00:14.940> let's<00:00:15.090> do<00:00:15.209> a

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
ordered from aqua copters so let's do a

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.180 
ordered from aqua copters so let's do a
quick<00:00:15.480> gun<00:00:15.660> boxing<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.379> see<00:00:16.710> what<00:00:16.830> they<00:00:16.949> sent

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
quick gun boxing and see what they sent

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.430 
quick gun boxing and see what they sent
us<00:00:17.279> this<00:00:18.119> is<00:00:18.270> how<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.420> received<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:18.990> frame<00:00:19.230> and

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:19.440 
us this is how I received the frame and

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.510 
us this is how I received the frame and
as<00:00:19.590> you<00:00:19.710> can<00:00:19.770> see<00:00:19.830> they<00:00:20.039> did<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.220> pretty<00:00:20.310> good

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
as you can see they did a pretty good

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.460 
as you can see they did a pretty good
job<00:00:20.580> of<00:00:20.970> packaging<00:00:21.269> it<00:00:21.509> so<00:00:21.960> let's<00:00:22.140> get<00:00:22.230> it<00:00:22.380> out

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
job of packaging it so let's get it out

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.320 
job of packaging it so let's get it out
of<00:00:22.679> the<00:00:22.740> box<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.339> get<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.609> closer<00:00:23.820> look<00:00:23.999> at<00:00:24.179> it

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
of the box and get a closer look at it

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.210 
of the box and get a closer look at it
this<00:00:24.929> is<00:00:24.990> what<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.349> quad<00:00:25.619> frame<00:00:25.859> looks<00:00:26.070> like

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
this is what the quad frame looks like

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.819 
this is what the quad frame looks like
out<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:26.429> the<00:00:26.580> box<00:00:26.849> as<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.869> can<00:00:27.900> see<00:00:28.259> it's

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:28.829 
out of the box as you can see it's

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:31.579 
out of the box as you can see it's
already<00:00:29.039> all<00:00:29.339> preassembled<00:00:30.169> the<00:00:31.169> two<00:00:31.349> halves

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:31.589 
already all preassembled the two halves

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:33.710 
already all preassembled the two halves
are<00:00:31.829> article<00:00:32.700> eat<00:00:32.820> together<00:00:32.970> and<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.690> looks

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
are article eat together and it looks

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.630 
are article eat together and it looks
like<00:00:33.870> they<00:00:34.020> did<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.200> really<00:00:34.410> good<00:00:34.650> job<00:00:34.710> on<00:00:35.400> the

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
like they did a really good job on the

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.360 
like they did a really good job on the
scene<00:00:35.870> as<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:37.020> does<00:00:37.170> have<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.440> be<00:00:37.590> watertight

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
scene as it does have to be watertight

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.370 
scene as it does have to be watertight
so<00:00:39.000> we<00:00:39.330> don't<00:00:39.480> want<00:00:39.630> any<00:00:39.750> leaks<00:00:39.900> in<00:00:40.170> there<00:00:40.290> it

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:40.380 
so we don't want any leaks in there it

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.200 
so we don't want any leaks in there it
looks<00:00:40.590> like<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:41.310> should<00:00:41.460> be<00:00:41.580> pretty<00:00:41.820> much<00:00:41.880> leak

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
looks like it should be pretty much leak

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.620 
looks like it should be pretty much leak
proof<00:00:42.530> now<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:44.100> did<00:00:44.400> order<00:00:44.670> mine<00:00:45.000> with<00:00:45.480> the

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:45.630 
proof now I did order mine with the

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.560 
proof now I did order mine with the
optional<00:00:46.490> pressure<00:00:47.490> equalization<00:00:48.000> valve

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
optional pressure equalization valve

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.440 
optional pressure equalization valve
that<00:00:49.230> way<00:00:49.380> if<00:00:49.500> you're<00:00:49.620> running<00:00:49.830> a<00:00:50.450> control

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:51.450 
that way if you're running a control

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.890 
that way if you're running a control
board<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.960> has<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.880> barometer<00:00:53.880> on<00:00:54.330> it<00:00:54.510> it'll

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:54.900 
board that has a barometer on it it'll

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.020 
board that has a barometer on it it'll
equalize<00:00:55.290> the<00:00:55.440> pressure<00:00:55.560> on<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:55.980> inside<00:00:56.100> I

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
equalize the pressure on the inside I

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.480 
equalize the pressure on the inside I
believe<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.080> it<00:00:58.530> just<00:00:58.740> has<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.920> piece<00:00:59.310> of

00:00:59.480 --> 00:00:59.490 
believe that it just has a piece of

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.070 
believe that it just has a piece of
breathable<00:00:59.970> cloth<00:01:00.240> on<00:01:00.450> the<00:01:00.540> inside<00:01:00.840> and

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.080 
breathable cloth on the inside and

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.450 
breathable cloth on the inside and
there's<00:01:01.320> bunch<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.620> holes<00:01:01.800> drilled<00:01:02.220> here

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
there's bunch of holes drilled here

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.820 
there's bunch of holes drilled here
let's<00:01:03.420> take<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.690> cover<00:01:03.900> off<00:01:03.990> and<00:01:04.439> see<00:01:04.680> what

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
let's take the cover off and see what

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.200 
let's take the cover off and see what
else<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.009> inside<00:01:05.339> there<00:01:05.610> looks<00:01:05.939> like<00:01:06.030> there's

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
else is inside there looks like there's

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.760 
else is inside there looks like there's
a<00:01:06.270> little<00:01:06.360> bag<00:01:06.630> with<00:01:06.900> some<00:01:07.049> gaskets<00:01:07.619> or

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
a little bag with some gaskets or

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.410 
a little bag with some gaskets or
something<00:01:08.070> let<00:01:08.579> me<00:01:08.609> go<00:01:08.729> ahead<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.090> set<00:01:09.329> the

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
something let me go ahead and set the

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.639 
something let me go ahead and set the
camera<00:01:09.689> down<00:01:09.719> and<00:01:10.079> I'll<00:01:10.170> take<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.469> lid<00:01:10.619> off

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649 
camera down and I'll take the lid off

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:11.989 
camera down and I'll take the lid off
and<00:01:10.859> get<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.070> bay<00:01:11.189> out<00:01:11.219> and<00:01:11.579> see<00:01:11.670> what's<00:01:11.850> in

00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:11.999 
and get the bay out and see what's in

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:14.419 
and get the bay out and see what's in
there<00:01:12.149> okay<00:01:13.079> I<00:01:13.109> got<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.469> bag<00:01:13.619> out<00:01:13.829> from<00:01:14.100> inside

00:01:14.419 --> 00:01:14.429 
there okay I got the bag out from inside

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:16.249 
there okay I got the bag out from inside
and<00:01:14.729> like<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.210> was<00:01:15.329> saying<00:01:15.479> it's<00:01:15.929> got<00:01:16.079> some

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
and like I was saying it's got some

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.649 
and like I was saying it's got some
gaskets<00:01:16.740> here<00:01:16.950> there's<00:01:17.429> a<00:01:17.520> main<00:01:17.729> gasket<00:01:18.270> for

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
gaskets here there's a main gasket for

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.289 
gaskets here there's a main gasket for
sealing<00:01:19.109> the<00:01:19.289> cover<00:01:19.920> on<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.159> top<00:01:20.999> of<00:01:21.179> the

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
sealing the cover on the top of the

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.660 
sealing the cover on the top of the
quadcopter<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.170> there's<00:01:22.829> some<00:01:23.009> X<00:01:23.249> patterns

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
quadcopter and there's some X patterns

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.279 
quadcopter and there's some X patterns
here<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:23.999> believe<00:01:24.390> these<00:01:24.479> go<00:01:24.689> underneath<00:01:25.079> the

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:25.289 
here I believe these go underneath the

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:26.870 
here I believe these go underneath the
motor<00:01:25.499> mounts<00:01:25.859> to<00:01:26.369> make<00:01:26.490> sure<00:01:26.609> that<00:01:26.759> they're

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
motor mounts to make sure that they're

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.929 
motor mounts to make sure that they're
watertight<00:01:27.390> as<00:01:27.569> well<00:01:27.810> so<00:01:28.560> that's<00:01:29.249> pretty<00:01:29.850> much

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
watertight as well so that's pretty much

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.520 
watertight as well so that's pretty much
everything<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.509> think<00:01:30.719> is<00:01:30.810> included<00:01:31.350> with

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
everything that I think is included with

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.160 
everything that I think is included with
the<00:01:31.859> quadcopter<00:01:32.189> frame<00:01:32.819> it<00:01:33.539> also<00:01:33.659> looks<00:01:33.960> like

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
the quadcopter frame it also looks like

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.760 
the quadcopter frame it also looks like
it<00:01:34.590> has<00:01:34.740> nice<00:01:35.060> brass<00:01:36.060> nuts<00:01:36.509> hurts<00:01:36.749> inside<00:01:37.469> so

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
it has nice brass nuts hurts inside so

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.739 
it has nice brass nuts hurts inside so
they<00:01:38.310> won't<00:01:38.490> get<00:01:38.639> stripped<00:01:38.909> out<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.299> they

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:39.749 
they won't get stripped out and they

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:42.529 
they won't get stripped out and they
shouldn't<00:01:40.049> corrode<00:01:40.639> the<00:01:41.639> screws<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.299> come

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539 
shouldn't corrode the screws that come

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:44.419 
shouldn't corrode the screws that come
with<00:01:42.749> it<00:01:42.780> for<00:01:43.139> mounting<00:01:43.499> the<00:01:43.590> motors<00:01:43.889> appear

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:44.429 
with it for mounting the motors appear

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:45.800 
with it for mounting the motors appear
to<00:01:44.549> be<00:01:44.639> stainless<00:01:45.060> steel<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:45.450> that's<00:01:45.630> also

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
to be stainless steel so that's also

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.349 
to be stainless steel so that's also
another<00:01:46.439> good<00:01:46.710> thing<00:01:46.939> everything<00:01:47.939> seems<00:01:48.299> to

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:48.359 
another good thing everything seems to

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:49.699 
another good thing everything seems to
be<00:01:48.450> made<00:01:48.630> out<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.780> nice<00:01:49.049> high-quality

00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:49.709 
be made out of nice high-quality

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:51.349 
be made out of nice high-quality
materials<00:01:50.249> so<00:01:50.549> I'm<00:01:50.639> pretty<00:01:50.789> happy<00:01:50.909> with<00:01:51.299> the

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:51.359 
materials so I'm pretty happy with the

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:53.690 
materials so I'm pretty happy with the
quadcopter<00:01:51.630> frames<00:01:52.139> so<00:01:52.319> far<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.829> do<00:01:53.459> have<00:01:53.639> a

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
quadcopter frames so far I do have a

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.099 
quadcopter frames so far I do have a
couple<00:01:53.939> things<00:01:54.030> I<00:01:54.209> need<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.450> mention<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:55.020> you

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
guys I ordered this quad frame and it

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:59.449 
guys I ordered this quad frame and it
took<00:01:57.780> about<00:01:57.929> seven<00:01:58.649> weeks<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:58.950> get<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.280> maybe

00:01:59.449 --> 00:01:59.459 
took about seven weeks to get it maybe

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:00.980 
took about seven weeks to get it maybe
just<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.700> little<00:01:59.909> bit<00:02:00.030> over<00:02:00.179> seven<00:02:00.600> weeks

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
just a little bit over seven weeks

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.169 
just a little bit over seven weeks
I<00:02:01.020> know<00:02:01.409> aqua<00:02:01.799> copters<00:02:02.159> is<00:02:02.310> really<00:02:02.670> backlogged

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:03.179 
I know aqua copters is really backlogged

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:04.550 
I know aqua copters is really backlogged
right<00:02:03.329> now<00:02:03.479> because<00:02:03.749> everybody's<00:02:04.259> trying<00:02:04.409> to

pretty<00:02:06.179> awesome<00:02:06.529> they<00:02:07.529> do<00:02:07.590> offer<00:02:07.920> them<00:02:08.160> in

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
pretty awesome they do offer them in

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.980 
pretty awesome they do offer them in
like<00:02:08.700> four<00:02:08.970> different<00:02:09.090> colors<00:02:09.509> if<00:02:09.630> I<00:02:09.720> remember

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
like four different colors if I remember

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.870 
like four different colors if I remember
right<00:02:10.110> there<00:02:10.800> was<00:02:11.100> a<00:02:11.130> clear<00:02:11.580> version

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
right there was a clear version

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.570 
right there was a clear version
available<00:02:12.409> right

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
available right

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.950 
available right
I<00:02:13.640> don't<00:02:13.850> think<00:02:14.030> they're<00:02:14.150> manufacturing<00:02:14.870> it

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
I don't think they're manufacturing it

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.060 
I don't think they're manufacturing it
because<00:02:15.170> that<00:02:15.260> was<00:02:15.380> what<00:02:15.560> I<00:02:15.590> originally

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
because that was what I originally

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.860 
because that was what I originally
wanted<00:02:16.190> to<00:02:16.400> get<00:02:16.580> but<00:02:17.240> I<00:02:17.270> settled<00:02:17.660> for<00:02:17.690> the

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
wanted to get but I settled for the

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:18.430 
wanted to get but I settled for the
white<00:02:18.050> one

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
white one

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.760 
white one
instead<00:02:19.100> they<00:02:20.090> also<00:02:20.270> have<00:02:20.540> a<00:02:20.570> slate<00:02:20.990> gray<00:02:21.020> and

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
instead they also have a slate gray and

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.670 
instead they also have a slate gray and
a<00:02:21.800> black<00:02:22.550> version<00:02:23.150> of<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.510> quadcopter<00:02:24.170> frame

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
a black version of the quadcopter frame

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.710 
a black version of the quadcopter frame
as<00:02:24.830> well<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.340> I<00:02:25.850> believe<00:02:25.880> they<00:02:26.180> also<00:02:26.360> do

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
as well and I believe they also do

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.140 
as well and I believe they also do
almost<00:02:27.440> ready<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:27.830> fly<00:02:27.980> versions<00:02:28.520> of<00:02:28.670> it<00:02:28.790> but

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
almost ready to fly versions of it but

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.400 
almost ready to fly versions of it but
I'm<00:02:29.270> sure<00:02:29.420> that's<00:02:29.570> probably<00:02:29.900> taking<00:02:30.320> me

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
I'm sure that's probably taking me

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.620 
I'm sure that's probably taking me
longer<00:02:30.590> to<00:02:30.770> get<00:02:30.980> one<00:02:31.190> like<00:02:32.030> said<00:02:32.240> it<00:02:32.270> took<00:02:32.510> me

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
longer to get one like said it took me

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.780 
longer to get one like said it took me
about<00:02:32.900> seven<00:02:33.200> weeks<00:02:33.440> to<00:02:33.650> get<00:02:33.800> mine<00:02:34.010> but<00:02:34.490> it<00:02:34.670> was

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
about seven weeks to get mine but it was

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.700 
about seven weeks to get mine but it was
definitely<00:02:34.970> worth<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:35.330> wait<00:02:35.480> I<00:02:35.840> can't<00:02:36.530> wait

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
definitely worth the wait I can't wait

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.290 
definitely worth the wait I can't wait
to<00:02:36.830> get<00:02:36.920> this<00:02:37.040> thing<00:02:37.220> together<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:37.850> put<00:02:38.180> my

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
to get this thing together and put my

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.470 
to get this thing together and put my
new<00:02:38.480> Sony<00:02:39.290> action<00:02:39.890> cam<00:02:40.220> on<00:02:40.610> there<00:02:40.820> and<00:02:41.000> do<00:02:41.300> some

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
new Sony action cam on there and do some

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.660
