00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.740
Where's the Gamer tag? What's the name?

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.240
YBK Super Luffy Killer?

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.960
We are going to talk about this afterwards with Santarou..

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.629
Luffy, where are you at? Where you at son?!

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.900

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.680

00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:31.133
Hmm... That's kinda boring...

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.820
Should I say something to make all the stream monsters mad at me?

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:35.840
if so...

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.440
Random person: "That's a good one"

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.320
I think this happened right after Luffy became the EVO 2014 champion

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.800
On Twitter, I mentioned that Sagat has advantage over Rose

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.220
And Luffy said, "No way Rose has the advantage"

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.380
At first, it was just a joke. I tweeted something like "if you are so confident with what you said , put all the money you got from EVO on the line"

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.900
Black eye's Nemo was amused with this and started sending little translations over to Luffy

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.120
In my opinion, I will probably win 85 or 90 percent of the time.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.400
Why's that?

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.240
I am just stronger then him

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.460
His heart is crushed

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.520
Santarou's way too strong

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.380
I am really appreciative of all the people who helped me. A lot of them usually don't even use Rose but they really helped me out.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.474
Everyday they helped me train.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.500
Again, thanks to all of you.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.940
I'm definitely going to kick Luffy's ass

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:39.780
"Hell no! How can you beat me? You got your ass handed to you by Itazan!"

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.800
Hey Luffy, is this yours?

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
DON'T RUN AWAY LITTLE BOY

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.120
