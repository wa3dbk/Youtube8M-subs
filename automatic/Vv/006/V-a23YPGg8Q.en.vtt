00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:27.530
 what are you seeing, it's a burning with 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:29.539
 the here 12 fuses when taking cheto del 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.759
 game good the weapon more than all the 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:35.240
 game and that all part of what everything 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:37.579
 bursts what he touches kills him and he 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.679
 about is that if you have not caught it, 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:42.049
 I know what the fuck you are hoping to use 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:44.780

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:55.250
 destroy the map that the second one that then 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.380
 as in all the fucking maps it leaves 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.739
 made a disgust obscures it leaves more 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.840
 dark that samuel eto'o's eye and the 

00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:04.579
 truth is that you can not see anything you will say what 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.500
 balls that level until they are good 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:09.210
 Mr. RubÃ©n or who took out a burning 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.360
 of packages you already know on this map 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:15.240
 the package and three the package is briefcase 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.770
 Well, it's up to you where this surely 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.980
 that the one that touches the most in this 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.860
 map of this comforting 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.629
 It is a gift point as it is in a streak and 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.959
 touch the other team they have fucked you but 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:30.319
 well and then the bastard tipped it 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:32.510
 took out another one that did not and said inn and I'm 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.849
 me to fuck the map so if I 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.650
 let's be able to the truth is that there 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.230
 a lot of people who do not like the map 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.360
 broken to me I like more the map destroyed 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.680
 that the normal map because I think 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.860
 that there are far fewer corners to 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.680
 I do not know what you think and 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.799

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.110

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:57.920
 It's the first time you start that in this 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.690
