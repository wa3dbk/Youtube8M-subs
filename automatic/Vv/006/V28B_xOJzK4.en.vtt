About 20% of a carpet gets 80% of the wear.
About 20% of beer drinkers drink 80% of the

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.609
beer in the world.
About 20% of a company’s customers account

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.240
for 80% of the complaints.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:27.240
This principle shows up over and over again
in almost every field and is called the 80/20,

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:33.500
or the Pareto principle. The ratios might
vary from one example to another, but try

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:40.500
to focus on a deeper meaning of the principle:
the majority of the effects come from the

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:48.440
minority of the causes. So let’s take a
look at how this works in business, social

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.800
interactions, and relationships…

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.920
Here’s how it works in business…

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.090
A few months ago, I had built a website and
was getting my visitors from social media,

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:04.019
like Reddit, Pinterest, Twitter, and other
social media and forums. In fact, this took

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.780
so much time that I was unable to write as
many articles as I wanted to. So I decided

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.780
I was going to make the process more efficient.
I looked into my data and guess what I found?

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.800
For every 1000 visitors I got from Reddit,
I got only about 60 from Pinterest, 20 from

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:30.680
Twitter, and a few more 20s from other forums
and social media. I thought I’m an idiot,

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.530
I’m spending the same amount of time on
all these platforms yet look at the results.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.370
So I basically completely cut out the ones
with the least effect, and it freed up so

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:48.590
much time for me to write actual articles
that people were interested in. And that made

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.320
a huge difference in how my website performed.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.030
Now let’s take a look at social interactions…

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.880
In college, I dedicated roughly the same amount
of time to the top ten people I hung out with.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.369
But I realized that the majority of the value
and happiness brought into my life only came

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:14.010
from two or three of those people. So I thought,
“I’m an idiot. What am I doing?” I decided

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.780
to dedicate my time to the two or three of
those people, and that freed up so much time

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.420
for me to read, meditate, go to the gym, and
to really develop myself.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.030
Let’s look at relationships…

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:34.420
A boyfriend or a husband comes home from work.
After five hours of spending time with her

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.459
girlfriend or wife, she complains, “You
don’t spend any time with me!” The guy

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:47.459
has no idea what is going on. He just spent
five hours with this woman. But did he really?

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:53.290
In those five hours even though he talked
to her and was physically with her, his focus

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:00.290
was also on watching TV half of the time and
the rest, checking his Facebook and his phone.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.290
Another guy could have worked longer hours,
come home and only spent an hour, literally

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.800
a single hour, with her and she would never
complain, because he would make that one hour

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.900
all about her.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:20.900
And that is the 80/20 principle applied to
business, social interactions, and relationships.

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:27.030
As a final thought, ironically what I have
done with my video follows the 80/20 principle

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:34.750
as well. I have shared about 80% or even more
of the value found in the book, in 20% or

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.590
even less time.
