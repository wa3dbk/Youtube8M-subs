 Hello friends today we have monday

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:11.130
 sin dropping tak and you're scoundrels

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.789
 so now we have a new tradition 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.400
 every Monday we will shoot 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.199

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.180
 I'll start showing my empty jars 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.670
 bottles and engage others 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.170
 indecent my but all this in the future 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.990

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.860
 tag questions i'm a book blogger 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.350
 drove when I visited the thought and 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.809
 making a video about books but you probably 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.289
 know what exactly to the bay by yale 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.450
 recently and I had no idea what is 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.250
 some kind of computer people 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.699
 some guys who are doing that 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.760
 that they only talk about books 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.309
 I thought the book someone needs to fuck up but 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.289
 it turned out there really is no 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.890
 education whole body 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:08.040
 which is purely sharpened by books 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.840
 someone's head someone's heart is arms and very 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.799
 cool now that this organism 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.500
 there is a member a new member in my face yes and I 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.110
 in this organism in this education 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.119
 feel very comfortable so 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.250
 god here and pretty cursed 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.430
 my first book about which I told 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.280
 on its channel it was a book game 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.860
 of thrones 1 book from the series of songs and apple 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.290
 ameli flame i just compared the book 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.990
 is real then I didnâ€™t even think about 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.049
 that I will talk about books sometime 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.090
 in more detail he just somehow it was 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.950
 could there game of thrones on peak 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.850
 Popularity thought something off 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:51.930
 but apparently it turned out to be a movie thing if 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:54.450
 such happen and fate we so happened 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.060
 that here I am in the bay by telling 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.520
 about books my favorite book and her 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.090
 probably called a lot when many times 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.729
 but I will repeat the mini hard my favorite 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.979
 the book has not changed for many years is a plus 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.560
 3 and punishment Dostoevsky and 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.030
 funny that at school I could not stand this 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.970
 the book she was in the school program 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.990
 makita excerpts read and I thought like hair 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.310
 boredom 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:24.610
 ua but later when I finished a long time ago 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:27.160
 the school is not taken and fell in love of course 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.959
 for school age on a bit hard 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.709
 or maybe it was me so dumb school 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:36.040
 I do not know well, but it could not do as well 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:38.319
 Now here is rereading but he did it 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.050
 the most powerful book that is very strong 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:44.319
 influenced me and i am what i am 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:48.250
 thanks to dostoevsky in a good way 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:50.350
 5 reasons not to leave this business oh reasons 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.230
 dofigishcha in fact it 's money 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:56.560
 because the cinema blessin brings huge 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.300
 money and power and women and some 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:03.220
 respect popularity 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:07.390
 good fantasy it all gives youtube and 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.319
 In general, the fact that any headquarters paper book 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.500
 electronic 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:13.900
 or audio and why on this subject I shot 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.750
 separate video where told in detail 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.920
 You can basically find it but for short 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.470
 i am old fashioned 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:24.940
 I like the old book you can 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:27.160
 sniff and lick chew yes it is for me 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.250
 most comfortable format but in principle 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.650
 I do not feel any discomfort 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:36.730
 stylish you really read this let's say with 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:39.010
 tablet or reader only thing to me 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.530
 difficult to listen to books because the pastor 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.590
 distracted and then lose my turn 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.260
 narrative and hard to read precisely with 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.980
 monitor screen do not know uncomfortable 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:53.620
 so basically i read to what no i 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.269
 I think that to deny himself his 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.519
 reading some book just because of 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.230
 that which can not be found in paper 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:02.620
 really stupid because the main thing 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.430
 Still not a form of content plus book 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.459
 blogging 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:10.209
 but it naturally echoes 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:13.390
 question where 5 reasons not to leave well 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:15.400
 seriously speaking probably the most 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.709
 big plus and what delivers the greatest 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.049
 the pleasure is social 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:23.250
 moment because I met with 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:25.990
 by many interesting people and there 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.639
 YouTube and just viewers 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.060
 I am always pleased when you write 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:32.949
 I really see a lot of comments 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.770
 deep thoughts people notice what i'm 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:37.360
 let's not noticed and you rub me 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.970
 answer and I'm really interested 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.979
 chat with viewers because I 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.349
 I feel that they tried on the channel really 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:47.759
 not stupid people and this is very very 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:51.000
 cool so thank you i love you 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:53.949
 considered all book bloggers to be their family 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.590
 Of course we read God is a big 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:59.740
 friendly family who unfortunately does not 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:02.139
 choose but have to with some 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:05.250
 the rules put up I do not like 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:08.500
 as they say in the family is not without a freak but 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:10.030
 still we are family and must each other 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.569
 love and support 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:15.580
 however difficult it may be and how 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:16.810
 would sometimes not want someone 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:22.409
 throw off the rag 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:22.409
 need to be patient because we imagine 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:30.190
 I resist and did not say any bad things 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:32.139
 almost we book for me and I probably 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.780
 refrain of such a pathos will not 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:38.800
 telling that books are everything to me 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:41.050
 no book you just cover and paper 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.680
 on which some words are written it 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.949
 can be 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:47.320
 clever deep thoughts can be any 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:50.530
 all nonsense 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:53.680
 but at the same time over there and a hundred years 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:56.259
 back and 200,000 years ago books were 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.150
 the main source of knowledge is the main 

00:05:56.259 --> 00:06:01.659
 source of some kind of spiritual growth and 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:03.610
 all the same I have my life now without books 

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:06.009
 can not imagine and despite the fact that there is 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:08.800
 Internet and TV some other 

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:11.949
 ways get information anyway 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:14.469
 books of their relevance are not lost 

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:17.409
 and I think in the near future do not lose 

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:19.990
 that's enough for my generation so 

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:22.270
 read books this is the last question 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.759
 of this tag on this i will be with you 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:26.250
