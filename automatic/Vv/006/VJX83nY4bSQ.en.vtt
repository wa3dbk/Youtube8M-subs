in<00:07:08.120> a<00:07:08.180> couple<00:07:08.479> of<00:07:08.509> foxes<00:07:08.990> your<00:07:09.680> your<00:07:10.190> defenses

00:07:10.749 --> 00:07:10.759 
in a couple of foxes your your defenses

00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:13.600 
in a couple of foxes your your defenses
are<00:07:10.879> fine<00:07:11.090> so<00:07:11.870> whatever<00:07:12.050> use<00:07:12.470> Falcons<00:07:13.009> snipe

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:17.449 
minutes that time I think last time it

00:07:17.449 --> 00:07:19.029 
minutes that time I think last time it
took<00:07:17.479> me<00:07:17.629> like<00:07:17.870> seven<00:07:18.440> minutes<00:07:18.740> or<00:07:18.889> something

00:07:21.249 --> 00:07:21.259 
it's not that long in the stage not too

00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:23.920 
it's not that long in the stage not too
hard<00:07:21.970> and<00:07:22.970> because<00:07:23.270> we<00:07:23.389> went<00:07:23.509> out<00:07:23.629> the<00:07:23.750> right
