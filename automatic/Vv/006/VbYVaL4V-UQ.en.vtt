00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.680 
which is good that I have a side cut
because<00:05:10.950> I'm<00:05:11.280> really<00:05:11.880> really<00:05:12.000> bad<00:05:12.360> with<00:05:12.540> my

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
because I'm really really bad with my

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.960 
because I'm really really bad with my
right<00:05:12.900> side<00:05:13.140> so<00:05:13.590> I<00:05:13.890> don't<00:05:14.520> have<00:05:14.670> as<00:05:14.760> much<00:05:14.910> hair

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
right side so I don't have as much hair

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.760 
right side so I don't have as much hair
I<00:05:15.180> have<00:05:15.390> to<00:05:15.510> curl<00:05:15.750> there<00:05:15.930> so<00:05:16.140> that<00:05:16.290> works<00:05:16.470> both

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
I have to curl there so that works both

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.100 
I have to curl there so that works both
ways<00:05:17.010> and<00:05:17.520> another<00:05:18.000> thing<00:05:18.300> is<00:05:18.480> if<00:05:18.690> you<00:05:18.870> have<00:05:19.080> a

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
ways and another thing is if you have a

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.780 
ways and another thing is if you have a
side<00:05:19.380> cut<00:05:19.620> as<00:05:19.740> well<00:05:19.950> it<00:05:20.160> really<00:05:20.310> doesn't<00:05:20.580> look

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:20.790 
side cut as well it really doesn't look

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.480 
side cut as well it really doesn't look
too<00:05:21.090> bad<00:05:21.120> with<00:05:22.020> curls<00:05:22.410> this<00:05:22.650> is<00:05:22.800> my<00:05:22.950> first<00:05:23.280> time

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
too bad with curls this is my first time

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.730 
too bad with curls this is my first time
curling<00:05:23.970> my<00:05:24.060> hair<00:05:24.090> with<00:05:24.420> a<00:05:24.450> side<00:05:24.780> cut<00:05:25.080> so<00:05:25.410> I

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
curling my hair with a side cut so I

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.380 
curling my hair with a side cut so I
didn't<00:05:26.280> think<00:05:26.370> it<00:05:26.520> looked<00:05:26.670> too<00:05:26.850> bad<00:05:27.090> but<00:05:27.300> I

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
didn't think it looked too bad but I

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.990 
didn't think it looked too bad but I
just<00:05:27.420> kind<00:05:27.810> of<00:05:27.870> hold<00:05:28.110> the<00:05:28.890> curling<00:05:29.490> wand<00:05:29.550> on

seconds<00:05:32.640> nothing<00:05:32.940> longer<00:05:33.300> than<00:05:33.630> that<00:05:33.750> because

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
seconds nothing longer than that because

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.560
