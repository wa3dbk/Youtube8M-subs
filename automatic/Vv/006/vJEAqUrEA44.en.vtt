00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.650
 last chooses school June blessed stamp 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.440
 biology teacher and together we 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.429
 let's see the synapses 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.960
 after seeing so synapses of 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.880
 general way we'll talk about 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.230
 the neuromuscular junction that a 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.539
 specific synapse because in fact at 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.010
 place to be between lakes rings and a 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.859
 dendrite between a dendrite shareholder 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.590
 it's going to be just between them a 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.849
 own axis of a motorcycle neurons and a fiber 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.109
 muscle and 7 synapses 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.149
 neuromuscular will allow the 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.340
 contraction of the muscle so this pattern 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.329
 roughly describes a set 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.980
 of actions that will happen so from the 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.989
 spinal cord for example where there is and 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.739
 there are motor neurons and so who is going 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.340
 to irritate the muscle fibers and this 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.070
 structure here so the actual contact between 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.550
 the lake sound motorcycle neurons and fiber 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.340
 muscular 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.660
 it's going to be a driving plate so that 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.670
 is called neuromuscular junction or 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.670
 motor plates 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.530
 both can be used and therefore 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.820
 in fact the number of motor plates there 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.080
 not going to have a motor plate by 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.189
 muscle fiber because otherwise he 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.720
 would need a quantity but really 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.360
 huge motorcycles neurons 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.070
 so in fact the body quite suitable and he 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.240
 is a motive plate for a certain 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.650
 number of muscle fibers 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.479
 indeed when you are going to have a 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.580
 plate motives here the fibers 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.070
 muscle are such and ben 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.450
 in fact peace is driving that has to this 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.170
 place there well what are you going to do 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.270
 serve allow contraction of all 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.009
 muscle fibers around 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.799
 so that is for the muscles 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.450
 for example like the muscle of the leg 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.369
 where there is a need for finesse 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.509
 relatively weak contraction and ben 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.890
 in fact it's worth a motive plate 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.899
 for several hundred girls by 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.340
 example while as for the 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.049
 cave muscles lose control 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.880
 fingers and so that allow a 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.200
 much finer motor skills and ben he 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.090
 is going to have a driving plate for a 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.890
 tens of fibers so the number of 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.700
 determining the motor is flat 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.110
 motor sensitivity is so now 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.729
 if at the most precisely at the level of 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.649
 the neuromuscular junction agreement is 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.270
 the level of the synapse that form the 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.500
 neuromuscular junction and well one 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.829
 found again 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.390
 firstly the pre-synaptic part 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:11.039
 the synaptic infant and the party 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.459
 pastina ticket in this case the fiber 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.920
 muscular 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.690
 so if we 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.520
 the pre synaptic part so we 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.280
 the axon of the motor neuron that arrives with 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.930
 here the myelin sheath is so the 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.730
 action potential will happen and will 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.590
 happen more precisely to the button 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.209
 terminal in which he went 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.180
 vesicles of neurotransmitters and in 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.370
 this case the neurotransmitter is 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.260
 acetylcholine asu ach can see 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.520
 also chris wood form is so the 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.360
 new vapor transmitter released in the 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.970
 synaptic cleft 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.440
 here so the acetylcholine is going to be released 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.200
 in synaptic cleft evans is all 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:46.250
 to simply focus on 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.750
 receivers a channel receiver located on 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.560
 the post inactive part located on 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.230
 muscle fiber 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.390
 so this channel receiver is going to make it 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.060
 enter a certain type of dion that go into 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.700
 actually activated the muscle fiber of 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.350
 polarize the muscle fiber and 7 of 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.950
 polarizations will actually allow the 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.950
 muscle contraction 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.319
 so that will be all about the 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.850
 synapses 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.630
 I hope this has been helpful to you 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.630
 soon on ten there flows
