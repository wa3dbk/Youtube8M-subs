still<00:00:43.850> am<00:00:44.120> but<00:00:44.720> it<00:00:45.170> kind<00:00:45.470> of<00:00:45.589> concrete's<00:00:46.159> the

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
still am but it kind of concrete's the

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:47.649 
still am but it kind of concrete's the
fact<00:00:46.519> a<00:00:46.640> little<00:00:46.790> bit<00:00:46.879> better<00:00:47.030> weather<00:00:47.480> how<00:00:47.600> we

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:47.659 
fact a little bit better weather how we

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:50.829 
fact a little bit better weather how we
get<00:00:47.870> to<00:00:47.989> see<00:00:48.170> dandy<00:00:48.650> see<00:00:49.159> his<00:00:49.519> old<00:00:49.839> golden

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
into the future okay that's pretty much

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.869 
into the future okay that's pretty much
what<00:01:00.500> we<00:01:00.589> got<00:01:00.739> the<00:01:00.800> concept<00:01:01.220> of<00:01:01.309> at<00:01:01.519> the<00:01:01.610> ending

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879
