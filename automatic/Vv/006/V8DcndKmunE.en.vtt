comes<00:02:53.700> on<00:02:53.910> a<00:02:53.940> string<00:02:54.390> of<00:02:54.570> good<00:02:54.810> news<00:02:55.080> and<00:02:55.440> I

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
comes on a string of good news and I

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.430 
comes on a string of good news and I
think<00:02:56.400> one<00:02:56.880> has<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.180> be<00:02:57.510> exceedingly<00:02:58.110> careful

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
think one has to be exceedingly careful

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.620 
think one has to be exceedingly careful
at<00:02:58.800> this<00:02:58.950> point<00:02:59.280> it'd<00:02:59.490> be<00:02:59.520> easier<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.210> get

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
at this point it'd be easier to get

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.530 
at this point it'd be easier to get
carried<00:03:00.960> away<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:01.650> say<00:03:02.370> this<00:03:02.640> is<00:03:02.700> it<00:03:03.060> it's<00:03:03.450> all

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
carried away and say this is it it's all

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.210 
carried away and say this is it it's all
over<00:03:03.570> and<00:03:03.900> done<00:03:04.020> with<00:03:04.350> but<00:03:04.710> there<00:03:04.920> are<00:03:04.950> enough

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
over and done with but there are enough

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.400 
over and done with but there are enough
things<00:03:05.490> out<00:03:05.670> there<00:03:05.880> horizon<00:03:06.600> that<00:03:07.110> I

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
things out there horizon that I

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.380 
things out there horizon that I
definitely<00:03:08.190> would<00:03:08.760> not<00:03:08.910> draw<00:03:09.240> that

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
definitely would not draw that

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.500 
definitely would not draw that
conclusion<00:03:10.070> looking<00:03:11.070> forward<00:03:11.400> this<00:03:12.030> is<00:03:12.270> good

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
conclusion looking forward this is good

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.630 
conclusion looking forward this is good
news<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:13.110> direction<00:03:13.680> right<00:03:14.130> now<00:03:14.370> is

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
news the direction right now is

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.820 
news the direction right now is
definitely<00:03:14.820> up<00:03:15.330> but<00:03:16.080> there<00:03:16.290> could<00:03:16.620> be<00:03:16.680> a

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
definitely up but there could be a

the<00:05:04.990> upturn<00:05:05.350> is<00:05:05.620> a<00:05:05.650> stronger<00:05:06.190> economy<00:05:06.310> without

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
the upturn is a stronger economy without

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.570 
the upturn is a stronger economy without
a<00:05:07.210> doubt<00:05:07.480> and<00:05:07.750> housing<00:05:08.680> in<00:05:08.770> the<00:05:08.800> economy<00:05:09.400> will

a doubt and housing in the economy will

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.060 
a doubt and housing in the economy will
feed<00:05:09.880> each<00:05:10.060> other<00:05:10.300> going<00:05:11.020> up<00:05:11.320> just

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
feed each other going up just

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.130 
feed each other going up just
unfortunately<00:05:12.880> as<00:05:13.090> they<00:05:13.270> starved<00:05:13.750> each<00:05:13.900> other

on the way down that is really the

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.090 
on the way down that is really the

number one factor number two is let's

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.860 
number one factor number two is let's
hope<00:05:21.190> the<00:05:21.340> Fed<00:05:21.730> doesn't<00:05:21.970> drag<00:05:22.300> interest<00:05:22.660> rates

up<00:05:23.080> in<00:05:23.230> a<00:05:23.290> big<00:05:23.500> hurry<00:05:23.710> I<00:05:24.010> don't<00:05:24.460> think<00:05:24.550> they

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
up in a big hurry I don't think they

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.090 
up in a big hurry I don't think they
will<00:05:25.120> but<00:05:25.930> that<00:05:26.140> would<00:05:26.320> definitely<00:05:26.530> put<00:05:26.890> a

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
will but that would definitely put a

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.120 
will but that would definitely put a
solid<00:05:28.000> damper<00:05:28.420> on<00:05:28.480> housing<00:05:29.020> right<00:05:29.380> if<00:05:29.710> it<00:05:29.890> did

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
solid damper on housing right if it did

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.280 
solid damper on housing right if it did
number<00:05:31.000> three<00:05:31.240> is<00:05:31.270> probably<00:05:31.750> a<00:05:31.840> little<00:05:31.960> bit<00:05:32.170> of

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.290 
number three is probably a little bit of

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:36.390 
number three is probably a little bit of

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:53.740 
the housing market has improved enough

the housing market has improved enough
do<00:05:53.920> you<00:05:54.040> agree<00:05:54.280> with<00:05:54.490> that<00:05:54.520> assessment<00:05:56.280> well<00:05:57.280> I

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
do you agree with that assessment well I

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.400 
do you agree with that assessment well I
would<00:05:57.940> certainly<00:05:58.120> agree<00:05:58.390> the<00:05:58.570> housing<00:05:59.020> market

00:05:59.400 --> 00:05:59.410 
would certainly agree the housing market

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:03.540 
would certainly agree the housing market
is<00:05:59.530> definitely<00:06:00.180> improved<00:06:01.180> and<00:06:02.070> you<00:06:03.070> know<00:06:03.190> the

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550 
is definitely improved and you know the

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.190 
is definitely improved and you know the
odds<00:06:03.700> are<00:06:04.000> not<00:06:04.180> overwhelming<00:06:04.930> it<00:06:05.020> would

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:05.200 
odds are not overwhelming it would

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.120 
odds are not overwhelming it would
continue<00:06:05.560> to<00:06:05.740> improve<00:06:06.220> a<00:06:07.740> second<00:06:08.740> I<00:06:08.860> think

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.130 
continue to improve a second I think

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.520 
continue to improve a second I think
mostly<00:06:09.520> what<00:06:09.730> that<00:06:09.940> credit<00:06:10.600> does<00:06:10.840> here<00:06:11.230> on<00:06:11.350> out

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:11.530 
mostly what that credit does here on out

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.770 
mostly what that credit does here on out
is<00:06:11.770> move<00:06:12.370> sales<00:06:12.730> back<00:06:13.030> and<00:06:13.270> forth<00:06:13.510> between

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:13.780 
is move sales back and forth between

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.960 
is move sales back and forth between
october<00:06:14.410> november<00:06:14.860> december<00:06:14.890> january<00:06:15.370> and

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:15.970 
october november december january and

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.570 
october november december january and
maybe<00:06:16.240> februari<00:06:16.840> it<00:06:17.440> doesn't<00:06:18.010> really<00:06:18.160> create

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:18.580 
maybe februari it doesn't really create

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.810 
maybe februari it doesn't really create
new<00:06:18.760> sales<00:06:19.120> so<00:06:19.600> i<00:06:20.050> would<00:06:21.040> certainly<00:06:21.580> be

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:21.820 
new sales so i would certainly be

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.810 
new sales so i would certainly be
hesitant<00:06:22.330> about<00:06:22.510> extending<00:06:23.230> it<00:06:23.350> but<00:06:24.100> you<00:06:24.760> know

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:24.820 
hesitant about extending it but you know

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.060 
hesitant about extending it but you know
this<00:06:25.180> is<00:06:25.210> both<00:06:25.540> policy<00:06:26.140> and<00:06:26.290> politics<00:06:26.800> so<00:06:27.040> i

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.070 
this is both policy and politics so i

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.310 
this is both policy and politics so i
think<00:06:27.310> one<00:06:27.460> trace<00:06:27.700> lightly<00:06:28.240> mr.<00:06:28.900> Blitzer<00:06:29.080> we

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:29.320 
think one trace lightly mr. Blitzer we

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.410 
think one trace lightly mr. Blitzer we
have<00:06:29.470> about<00:06:29.680> 20<00:06:30.100> seconds<00:06:30.520> any<00:06:30.820> chance<00:06:31.150> these

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:31.420 
have about 20 seconds any chance these

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.720 
have about 20 seconds any chance these
numbers<00:06:31.780> could<00:06:31.960> reverse<00:06:32.350> themselves<00:06:32.730> of

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:33.730 
numbers could reverse themselves of

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:35.340 
numbers could reverse themselves of
course<00:06:33.910> there's<00:06:34.510> always<00:06:34.720> a<00:06:34.840> chance<00:06:35.110> the

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:35.350 
course there's always a chance the

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.590 
course there's always a chance the
numbers<00:06:35.650> go<00:06:35.770> the<00:06:35.920> wrong<00:06:36.070> way<00:06:36.130> and<00:06:36.550> we<00:06:37.390> learned

numbers go the wrong way and we learned

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.570 
numbers go the wrong way and we learned
that<00:06:37.810> the<00:06:37.960> hard<00:06:37.990> way

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580
