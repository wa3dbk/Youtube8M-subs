00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
thing with the next one so a section

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.210 
thing with the next one so a section
from<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.790> back<00:01:33.829> bring<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:34.909> under

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.120 

to<00:01:43.270> rejoin<00:01:43.570> the<00:01:43.720> section<00:01:44.080> it's<00:01:44.320> from

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.740 

obviously<00:01:49.130> the<00:01:49.280> ribbon<00:01:49.549> it's<00:01:49.789> a<00:01:50.030> little<00:01:50.509> hard

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
obviously the ribbon it's a little hard

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.459 
obviously the ribbon it's a little hard
to<00:01:50.930> see<00:01:51.079> it<00:01:51.229> the<00:01:51.350> fishtail<00:01:52.360> forming<00:01:53.360> but<00:01:54.350> if

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:54.469 
to see it the fishtail forming but if

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:59.289 
to see it the fishtail forming but if
you<00:01:54.560> look<00:01:54.710> very<00:01:54.890> closely<00:01:56.920> you<00:01:57.920> can<00:01:57.950> see<00:01:58.399> you

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
you look very closely you can see you

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:12.350 
you look very closely you can see you
have<00:01:59.479> a<00:02:00.460> v-shape

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.190 

you<00:02:13.360> will<00:02:13.540> need<00:02:13.810> a<00:02:14.700> hair<00:02:15.700> tie<00:02:15.940> and<00:02:16.270> maybe<00:02:17.050> a<00:02:17.140> few

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
you will need a hair tie and maybe a few

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.770 
you will need a hair tie and maybe a few
bobby<00:02:17.530> pins<00:02:17.970> so<00:02:18.970> brush<00:02:19.180> your<00:02:19.330> hair<00:02:19.360> to<00:02:19.660> one

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
bobby pins so brush your hair to one

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.650 
bobby pins so brush your hair to one
side<00:02:19.840> it's<00:02:20.830> not<00:02:21.100> easier<00:02:21.520> to<00:02:21.730> do<00:02:21.880> this<00:02:22.060> braid

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
side it's not easier to do this braid

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.810 
side it's not easier to do this braid
one<00:02:23.020> you<00:02:23.560> can<00:02:23.709> see<00:02:23.740> what<00:02:23.980> you're<00:02:24.100> doing<00:02:26.580> if<00:02:27.580> you

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
one you can see what you're doing if you

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.520 
one you can see what you're doing if you
wish<00:02:27.970> to<00:02:28.000> ponytail<00:02:28.390> here<00:02:28.780> you<00:02:29.050> may<00:02:29.170> also<00:02:29.350> do

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
wish to ponytail here you may also do

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.880 
wish to ponytail here you may also do
that<00:02:30.660> so<00:02:31.660> separate<00:02:32.200> your<00:02:32.350> hair<00:02:32.560> into<00:02:32.740> two

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
that so separate your hair into two

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:47.590 
that so separate your hair into two
halves<00:02:33.640> and<00:02:35.400> make<00:02:36.400> sure<00:02:36.430> they're<00:02:36.730> even

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.320 

so<00:02:48.290> with<00:02:48.560> my<00:02:48.710> thumb<00:02:49.130> and<00:02:49.370> my<00:02:49.430> first<00:02:49.790> finger<00:02:50.000> I'm

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
so with my thumb and my first finger I'm

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.600 
so with my thumb and my first finger I'm
going<00:02:50.570> to<00:02:50.690> take<00:02:50.870> a<00:02:51.080> section<00:02:51.290> from<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:51.710> back<00:02:51.950> of

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
going to take a section from the back of

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.830 
going to take a section from the back of
one<00:02:52.670> half

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.710 

with<00:02:56.319> that<00:02:56.500> section<00:02:57.040> I'm<00:02:57.220> going<00:02:57.280> to<00:02:57.730> go<00:02:57.879> under

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
with that section I'm going to go under

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:06.420 
with that section I'm going to go under
and<00:03:00.120> over

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.670 

and<00:03:07.000> put<00:03:07.659> it<00:03:07.750> back<00:03:07.900> with<00:03:08.379> the<00:03:08.409> original

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
and put it back with the original

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.759 
and put it back with the original
section<00:03:09.510> so<00:03:10.510> I'm<00:03:10.599> going<00:03:10.840> to<00:03:10.959> continue<00:03:11.319> this

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
section so I'm going to continue this

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:17.069 
section so I'm going to continue this
technique<00:03:12.750> alternating<00:03:13.750> paths<00:03:15.719> this<00:03:16.719> is<00:03:16.930> the

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
technique alternating paths this is the

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:24.330 
technique alternating paths this is the
same<00:03:17.260> exact<00:03:17.590> thing<00:03:17.799> we<00:03:17.980> did<00:03:18.189> with<00:03:18.489> the<00:03:18.549> ribbons

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.460 

also<00:03:25.120> this<00:03:25.300> type<00:03:25.540> of<00:03:25.569> braid<00:03:25.930> looks<00:03:26.170> better

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
also this type of braid looks better

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:35.220 
also this type of braid looks better
when<00:03:26.650> you<00:03:26.769> use<00:03:26.980> smaller<00:03:27.310> sections<00:03:34.200> you<00:03:35.200> can

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
when you use smaller sections you can

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:43.610 
when you use smaller sections you can
see<00:03:35.530> that<00:03:35.790> v4x<00:03:36.790> shape<00:03:37.180> starting<00:03:37.780> to<00:03:37.870> form

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.619 

so<00:03:44.250> it's<00:03:44.549> pretty<00:03:44.730> much<00:03:44.909> the<00:03:44.970> same<00:03:45.209> thing<00:03:45.269> and

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
so it's pretty much the same thing and

00:03:45.629 --> 00:04:13.600 
so it's pretty much the same thing and
i'm<00:03:46.170> just<00:03:46.319> going<00:03:46.590> to<00:03:46.620> fast<00:03:46.860> forward

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.910 

you<00:04:14.210> can<00:04:14.360> see<00:04:14.600> that<00:04:14.630> the<00:04:14.900> fishtail<00:04:15.500> braid<00:04:15.770> is

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
you can see that the fishtail braid is

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:30.040 
you can see that the fishtail braid is
forming<00:04:16.250> nicely

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.300 

so<00:04:31.050> I'm<00:04:31.170> actually<00:04:31.350> going<00:04:31.560> to<00:04:31.800> stop<00:04:32.010> here

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
so I'm actually going to stop here

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.860 
so I'm actually going to stop here
because<00:04:32.520> I<00:04:32.700> had<00:04:32.970> been<00:04:33.090> doing<00:04:33.360> this<00:04:33.450> brain<00:04:33.660> all

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
because I had been doing this brain all
