 Until the spring, for example, 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.179
 The process has only been called and made. 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:24.189
 The red line that runs until you approach it from dimension. 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:26.499
 Again through my friend 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:30.489
 Compared to this year, I was relatively greedy and positioned. 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:32.889
 Base 

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:35.750
 Star is called age 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.920
 According to the warriors, 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.220
 So 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.910
 Everything goes beyond that for every processor that does it 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.760
 pga q School completion 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.010

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.950
 I showed up again. 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.199
 But now it's a confrontation. 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:56.809
 If you are like me, take a look at the patrol boats 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:58.870

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.870
 I can not look at related products properly. 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.660
 When you get into it, 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.940
 In the evening, if you take a look at this photo, 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.400
 The process was not heeded because of the heavy rain. 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.380
 I was standing up 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.050
 Get in the port 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.710
 The car persuaded me to acquire the hardships, 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:24.980
 After meke 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:25.790
 If setting 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.010
 This is where the rubber band is appropriate to lock 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.820
 I want the principal to stop an event that has not been set 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:32.740

 I became a captain. 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.600
 When I get out 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.550

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.090
 One-day window Now you're pointing to a one-byte risk, 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.700

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:23.349
 Walk 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:24.889

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:27.489
 When this happens 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.269
 He passed away again. 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.280
 Philosophy And then that's right now with the backdrop and then 

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:35.889

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:00.480
 On camera 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.919
 I can not go to the pages. 

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:05.799
 Even after you receive it, 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:09.049
 like this 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.049
 You can zoom in. 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:15.419
 Well-being experience and shattering 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:18.419
 Because of this support already there 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:21.329
 Some on Mars 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:25.359
 That the fire is healthy in the scene 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:26.609
 That's it. 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:27.549
 However, 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:28.939
 Come out again 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:31.610

 It would be alpha. 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:42.399
 previously 

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:46.359
 My first feature is that this is a very good iPhone 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:49.359
 For example, 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:54.389
 In March 2010 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:58.209
 Kim Kyung-moon may not be the same. 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.619
 There are seven situations. 

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:03.149
 Billion 

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:04.519
 The real geography recently 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.279
 It's slowing down. 

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:09.159
 If you try to ban 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:11.219
 like this 

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:14.219
 You can worship and delete the song you want, 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:19.519
 Among them, I am sleepy. 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.469
 I can add more. 

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:24.509
 Google can stand alone 

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:27.509
 It seems like the kids fans are long. 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:29.960
 Five. 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.099

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.710
 First, 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.110
 I can add eyes. 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.750
 I am 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.270
 Come from 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.270
 The thing that made mistakes is creation 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:03.819
 Healing function 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:06.959
 The non-immersive part of the case 

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:10.279
 Practice on its own 

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:12.690
 First time 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.500
 It's out of sync now. 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.520

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.949
 First place 2nd place Image I was worried about the port, 

00:05:45.179 --> 00:05:48.389
 I think 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:49.539

00:05:59.269 --> 00:06:01.259
 I showed you 

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:06.539
 The Dong-A Ilbo has only 1% of all Israeli citizens. 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:07.279
