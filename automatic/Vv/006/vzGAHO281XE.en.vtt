00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
this is how I fixed the LG gas stove

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.789 
this is how I fixed the LG gas stove
knobs<00:00:05.629> there's<00:00:06.629> a<00:00:06.720> common<00:00:07.140> problem<00:00:07.620> with

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
knobs there's a common problem with

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.370 
knobs there's a common problem with
these<00:00:07.950> knobs<00:00:08.780> via<00:00:09.780> torque<00:00:11.660> that's<00:00:12.660> created

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
these knobs via torque that's created

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.560 
these knobs via torque that's created
when<00:00:13.410> using<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:13.920> knob<00:00:14.070> breaks<00:00:14.990> the<00:00:15.990> knob<00:00:16.199> to

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570 
when using the knob breaks the knob to

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.920 
when using the knob breaks the knob to
design<00:00:18.570> flaw<00:00:19.820> so<00:00:20.820> this<00:00:21.240> is<00:00:21.359> what<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:21.539> broken

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
design flaw so this is what a broken

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.500 
design flaw so this is what a broken
knob<00:00:22.080> looks<00:00:22.320> like<00:00:22.529> this<00:00:23.519> is<00:00:23.699> how<00:00:23.850> I<00:00:23.880> corrected

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
knob looks like this is how I corrected

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.720 
knob looks like this is how I corrected
it<00:00:24.600> on<00:00:26.990> a<00:00:27.990> table<00:00:28.470> here<00:00:28.680> is<00:00:28.920> all<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.279> tools<00:00:29.490> are

aluminum tube a mini watt mini tube
cutter<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:41.989> file<00:00:43.730> and<00:00:44.730> then<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.270> have<00:00:45.450> your

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
cutter a file and then you have your

cutter a file and then you have your
standard<00:00:45.690> tools<00:00:46.559> all<00:00:47.489> these<00:00:48.050> everything<00:00:49.050> cost

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
standard tools all these everything cost

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.340 
standard tools all these everything cost
$10<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:50.280> this<00:00:50.399> was<00:00:50.520> $10<00:00:51.120> this<00:00:51.510> two<00:00:51.780> was<00:00:51.930> $10

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
$10 so this was $10 this two was $10

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.910 
$10 so this was $10 this two was $10
this<00:00:53.250> file<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.760> six<00:00:54.289> so<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.440> price<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.710> the

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
this file is six so the price of the

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.209 
this file is six so the price of the
normal<00:00:56.250> replacement<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.940> knob<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:58.020> about<00:00:58.260> $70

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
normal replacement to knob is about $70

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.500 
normal replacement to knob is about $70
that<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.670> seen<00:01:00.079> there<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.320> 425<00:01:02.090> but<00:01:03.090> when<00:01:03.449> you

have<00:01:03.629> five<00:01:03.930> knobs<00:01:05.390> it's<00:01:06.390> give<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.600> over<00:01:06.810> 100

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
have five knobs it's give you over 100

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.620 
have five knobs it's give you over 100
hundred<00:01:07.710> dollars<00:01:07.979> so<00:01:08.729> this<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:09.030> how<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.180> fixed

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
hundred dollars so this is how I fixed

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.789 
hundred dollars so this is how I fixed
it<00:01:10.729> first<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:12.450> take<00:01:12.659> your<00:01:12.810> broken<00:01:13.020> knob<00:01:14.270> and

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
it first you take your broken knob and

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:18.170 
it first you take your broken knob and
you<00:01:16.799> look<00:01:17.159> if<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.460> see<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:17.939> there's<00:01:18.119> a

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
you look if you see that there's a

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.170 
you look if you see that there's a
little<00:01:18.360> deburring<00:01:18.869> inside<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.909> what<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:20.939> did

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
little deburring inside of it what I did

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.420 
little deburring inside of it what I did
was<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.479> took<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.810> needle<00:01:22.110> nose<00:01:22.229> pliers<00:01:22.590> and

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
was I took the needle nose pliers and

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.170 
was I took the needle nose pliers and
pulled<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.450> out<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.600> little<00:01:24.869> bit<00:01:25.939> and<00:01:26.939> what<00:01:27.060> you

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
pulled it out a little bit and what you

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.850 
pulled it out a little bit and what you
do<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.420> what<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:27.960> want<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.409> wanted<00:01:28.680> to

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
do is what you want is you wanted to

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.340 
do is what you want is you wanted to
have<00:01:29.009> this<00:01:29.189> d-ring<00:01:29.729> as<00:01:29.939> close<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.600> beginning

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
have this d-ring as close to beginning

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.710 
have this d-ring as close to beginning
as<00:01:31.560> possible<00:01:32.240> like<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:34.880> second<00:01:35.880> what<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.479> did

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
as possible like that second what I did

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.620 
as possible like that second what I did
was<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:36.930> measured<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:38.310> space<00:01:38.640> between<00:01:38.970> the

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
was I measured the space between the

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.319 
was I measured the space between the
flat<00:01:39.900> part<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.829> end<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.000> think<00:01:42.119> it's

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
flat part to the end so I think it's

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.870 
flat part to the end so I think it's
about<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.509> half<00:01:42.720> an<00:01:42.899> inch<00:01:43.369> and<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.430> marked<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:44.820> on

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
about a half an inch and I marked it on

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.730 
about a half an inch and I marked it on
the<00:01:44.939> tube<00:01:45.270> there<00:01:45.600> if<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:45.840> noticed

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
the tube there if you noticed

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.249 
the tube there if you noticed
so<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.460> measures<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:48.000> out<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.390> if<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.840> notice<00:01:49.110> I

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
so I measures it out and if you notice I

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.910 
so I measures it out and if you notice I
did<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.619> it's<00:01:50.460> measured<00:01:50.850> on<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.000> tube<00:01:51.299> there

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.050 

so<00:01:55.920> next<00:01:56.189> what<00:01:56.430> I'm<00:01:56.490> going<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.670> do<00:01:56.820> is<00:01:56.939> I'm

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
so next what I'm going to do is I'm

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.310 
so next what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.210> take<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.600> mini

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
going to take the mini

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.850 
going to take the mini
pipe<00:01:58.979> cutter<00:01:59.280> and<00:02:00.140> start<00:02:01.140> cutting<00:02:01.530> this<00:02:01.619> one

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
pipe cutter and start cutting this one

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.609 
pipe cutter and start cutting this one
little<00:02:02.250> ring<00:02:02.430> out<00:02:05.060> and<00:02:06.060> just<00:02:06.240> set<00:02:06.420> this<00:02:06.540> up<00:02:06.750> for

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
little ring out and just set this up for

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:08.630 
little ring out and just set this up for
those<00:02:07.770> other<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.099> don't<00:02:08.310> know<00:02:08.399> other<00:02:08.550> than

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
those other you don't know other than

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.529 
those other you don't know other than
mini<00:02:08.819> cutters<00:02:09.149> just<00:02:09.390> basically

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
mini cutters just basically

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.660 
mini cutters just basically
you<00:02:10.810> want<00:02:11.019> it<00:02:11.170> up<00:02:11.290> to<00:02:11.620> where<00:02:12.129> you<00:02:12.340> wanted<00:02:12.610> to

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
you want it up to where you wanted to

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:31.930 
you want it up to where you wanted to
cut<00:02:12.969> you<00:02:13.930> squeeze<00:02:14.290> it<00:02:14.530> down<00:02:18.450> squeeze<00:02:19.450> it<00:02:19.599> down

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.540 

add<00:02:32.510> it<00:02:32.600> to<00:02:32.690> the<00:02:32.810> part<00:02:33.050> then<00:02:33.950> just<00:02:34.160> rotate<00:02:34.520> it

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
add it to the part then just rotate it

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.980 
add it to the part then just rotate it
keep<00:02:35.330> rotating<00:02:35.480> until<00:02:36.080> it<00:02:36.140> breaks<00:02:36.290> off<00:02:37.990> and

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
keep rotating until it breaks off and

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:49.360 
keep rotating until it breaks off and
tightening<00:02:39.530> it<00:02:39.680> all<00:02:40.220> the<00:02:41.000> routines<00:02:47.770> so<00:02:48.770> if<00:02:49.250> you

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
tightening it all the routines so if you

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.860 
tightening it all the routines so if you
see<00:02:49.580> here<00:02:49.760> what<00:02:49.940> I<00:02:49.970> did<00:02:50.180> was<00:02:50.300> that<00:02:50.330> if<00:02:50.720> you

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
see here what I did was that if you

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.500 
see here what I did was that if you
notice<00:02:51.020> I<00:02:51.260> just<00:02:51.290> broke<00:02:51.620> I<00:02:52.060> cut<00:02:53.060> off<00:02:53.210> the<00:02:53.270> piece

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
notice I just broke I cut off the piece

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.800 
notice I just broke I cut off the piece
of<00:02:53.660> tube<00:02:53.870> it's<00:02:54.470> a<00:02:54.530> little<00:02:54.770> rank<00:02:55.750> about<00:02:56.750> a

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
of tube it's a little rank about a

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.970 
of tube it's a little rank about a
half-inch<00:02:57.820> notice<00:02:58.820> it's<00:02:59.000> about<00:02:59.800> the<00:03:00.800> same

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
half-inch notice it's about the same

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.240 
half-inch notice it's about the same
size<00:03:01.040> as<00:03:01.460> this<00:03:02.410> my<00:03:03.410> next<00:03:03.710> step<00:03:03.890> is<00:03:03.920> I'm<00:03:04.100> going

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
size as this my next step is I'm going

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.140 
size as this my next step is I'm going
to<00:03:04.310> since<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:04.760> inside<00:03:05.120> diameter<00:03:06.010> is<00:03:07.010> a<00:03:07.820> little

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
to since the inside diameter is a little

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.620 
to since the inside diameter is a little
smaller<00:03:08.570> than<00:03:08.960> this<00:03:09.590> plastic<00:03:10.100> piece<00:03:10.480> I'm<00:03:11.480> just

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
smaller than this plastic piece I'm just

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.860 
smaller than this plastic piece I'm just
going<00:03:11.750> to<00:03:11.780> file<00:03:12.080> down<00:03:12.440> the<00:03:12.470> inside<00:03:13.660> file<00:03:14.660> it

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
going to file down the inside file it

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:29.380 
going to file down the inside file it
out<00:03:15.020> make<00:03:15.440> it<00:03:15.470> a<00:03:15.650> little<00:03:15.800> bit<00:03:15.980> wider<00:03:28.270> so<00:03:29.270> what

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
out make it a little bit wider so what

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.760 
out make it a little bit wider so what
I'm<00:03:29.480> doing<00:03:29.510> is<00:03:29.750> I'm<00:03:29.960> just<00:03:29.990> making<00:03:30.410> the<00:03:30.500> inside

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
I'm doing is I'm just making the inside

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.980 
I'm doing is I'm just making the inside
diameter<00:03:31.040> just<00:03:31.430> a<00:03:31.880> bit<00:03:32.030> wider<00:03:32.530> since<00:03:34.990> it's

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:35.990 
diameter just a bit wider since it's

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:37.630 
diameter just a bit wider since it's
going<00:03:36.140> to<00:03:36.230> be<00:03:36.320> a<00:03:36.350> snug<00:03:36.770> fit<00:03:36.830> and<00:03:37.370> that's<00:03:37.430> what

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
going to be a snug fit and that's what

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.790 
going to be a snug fit and that's what
you<00:03:37.760> want<00:03:37.850> you<00:03:38.000> want<00:03:38.150> to<00:03:38.210> snug<00:03:38.480> fit<00:03:38.810> so<00:03:39.590> that

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
you want you want to snug fit so that

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.730 
you want you want to snug fit so that
this<00:03:39.950> plastic<00:03:40.490> piece<00:03:40.670> the<00:03:40.910> broken<00:03:41.300> pieces<00:03:41.740> are

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:42.740 
this plastic piece the broken pieces are

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.700 
this plastic piece the broken pieces are
pushed<00:03:43.520> in<00:03:43.790> together<00:03:43.970> and<00:03:44.660> making<00:03:45.350> pressure

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:45.710 
pushed in together and making pressure

00:03:45.710 --> 00:04:16.500 
pushed in together and making pressure
on<00:03:45.920> this<00:03:46.010> Emery

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.000 

so<00:04:17.510> what<00:04:17.630> I<00:04:17.660> did<00:04:17.840> was<00:04:17.989> I<00:04:18.079> use<00:04:18.229> these<00:04:18.410> pliers<00:04:18.680> to

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
so what I did was I use these pliers to

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.189 
so what I did was I use these pliers to
squeeze<00:04:19.190> the<00:04:20.260> plastic<00:04:21.260> piece<00:04:21.500> tighter<00:04:22.220> and<00:04:23.199> I

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:24.199 
squeeze the plastic piece tighter and I

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:25.960 
squeeze the plastic piece tighter and I
put<00:04:24.410> the<00:04:24.500> ring<00:04:24.680> above<00:04:25.040> it<00:04:25.250> it's<00:04:25.699> gonna<00:04:25.820> be<00:04:25.940> a

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
put the ring above it it's gonna be a

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.340 
put the ring above it it's gonna be a
really<00:04:26.120> tight<00:04:26.479> fit<00:04:26.810> so<00:04:28.360> once<00:04:29.360> you<00:04:29.419> could<00:04:29.570> slip

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
really tight fit so once you could slip

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:36.040 
really tight fit so once you could slip
