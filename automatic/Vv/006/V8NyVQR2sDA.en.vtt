00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
let's just say my I've been given a new

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.619 
let's just say my I've been given a new
guy<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.860> work<00:02:08.009> with<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.459> he<00:02:08.729> has<00:02:08.910> no<00:02:09.119> skill<00:02:09.450> and

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
guy to work with and he has no skill and

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.820 
guy to work with and he has no skill and
what<00:02:09.780> we<00:02:09.899> do<00:02:10.080> so

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
what we do so

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.530 
what we do so
it<00:02:10.950> takes<00:02:11.130> me<00:02:11.250> way<00:02:11.400> longer<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.880> do<00:02:12.090> what<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.390> do

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
it takes me way longer to do what I do

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.690 
it takes me way longer to do what I do
because<00:02:13.020> he<00:02:13.440> can't<00:02:13.680> do<00:02:13.920> it<00:02:14.070> okay<00:02:14.490> you<00:02:14.550> know

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
because he can't do it okay you know

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.650 
because he can't do it okay you know
what<00:02:14.820> I'm<00:02:14.910> saying<00:02:15.120> so<00:02:15.240> I'm<00:02:15.330> basically

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
what I'm saying so I'm basically

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.100 
what I'm saying so I'm basically
training<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.290> new<00:02:16.440> right<00:02:16.740> now<00:02:16.920> so<00:02:18.080> quite<00:02:19.080> a

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
training the new right now so quite a

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.210 
training the new right now so quite a
bit<00:02:19.260> of<00:02:19.350> a<00:02:19.410> speed<00:02:19.620> bump<00:02:19.800> which<00:02:19.980> is<00:02:20.070> probably

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
bit of a speed bump which is probably

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.560 
bit of a speed bump which is probably
one<00:02:20.430> of<00:02:20.460> the<00:02:20.550> main<00:02:20.700> reasons<00:02:21.090> i'm<00:02:21.210> getting<00:02:21.450> back

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770
