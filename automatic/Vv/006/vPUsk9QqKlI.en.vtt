help you to be more effective in your

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.380 
help you to be more effective in your
presentations<00:02:55.530> so<00:02:56.220> in<00:02:56.370> this<00:02:56.490> lesson<00:02:56.730> we'll

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
presentations so in this lesson we'll

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.900 
presentations so in this lesson we'll
learn<00:02:57.420> how<00:02:58.080> to<00:02:58.320> make<00:02:58.740> three<00:02:59.070> animation

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
learn how to make three animation

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.620 
learn how to make three animation
decisions<00:03:00.480> what<00:03:01.110> effect<00:03:01.680> to<00:03:02.190> animate<00:03:02.730> when

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
decisions what effect to animate when

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.130 
decisions what effect to animate when
the<00:03:03.960> effect<00:03:04.410> occurs<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.670> timing<00:03:06.210> and<00:03:06.240> at<00:03:06.840> what

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
the effect occurs the timing and at what

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.820 
the effect occurs the timing and at what
speed<00:03:07.910> here<00:03:08.910> you<00:03:09.090> see<00:03:09.390> your<00:03:09.810> options<00:03:10.440> and<00:03:10.620> i'll

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
speed here you see your options and i'll

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.520 
speed here you see your options and i'll
walk<00:03:11.190> you<00:03:11.250> through<00:03:11.820> step-by-step<00:03:12.210> how<00:03:13.080> and

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
walk you through step-by-step how and

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.310 
walk you through step-by-step how and
when<00:03:13.890> to<00:03:14.190> choose<00:03:14.610> each<00:03:15.000> of<00:03:15.240> those<00:03:15.390> options<00:03:15.720> for

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
when to choose each of those options for

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.490 
when to choose each of those options for
animating<00:03:17.010> your<00:03:17.160> effect<00:03:17.989> here<00:03:18.989> are<00:03:19.110> the<00:03:19.230> five

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
animating your effect here are the five

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.650 
animating your effect here are the five
steps<00:03:20.010> that<00:03:20.250> we<00:03:20.370> walk<00:03:20.670> through<00:03:20.700> so<00:03:21.209> i'd<00:03:21.360> like

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
steps that we walk through so i'd like

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.810 
steps that we walk through so i'd like
to<00:03:21.840> integrate<00:03:22.170> what<00:03:22.830> you<00:03:22.980> will<00:03:23.160> learn<00:03:23.430> as

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
to integrate what you will learn as

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.690 
to integrate what you will learn as
you're<00:03:24.300> learning<00:03:24.510> it<00:03:24.840> so<00:03:25.470> our<00:03:25.709> steps<00:03:26.190> will<00:03:26.520> be

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
you're learning it so our steps will be

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.090 
you're learning it so our steps will be
first<00:03:27.060> to<00:03:27.300> select<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:28.110> SmartArt<00:03:28.500> diagram

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
first to select the SmartArt diagram

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.310 
first to select the SmartArt diagram
that<00:03:29.280> you<00:03:29.430> want<00:03:29.610> to<00:03:29.700> animate<00:03:30.060> choose<00:03:30.780> what

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
that you want to animate choose what

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.130 
that you want to animate choose what
custom<00:03:31.890> animation<00:03:32.580> effect<00:03:33.060> that<00:03:33.300> you<00:03:33.330> want<00:03:33.480> to

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
custom animation effect that you want to

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.160 
custom animation effect that you want to
apply<00:03:34.410> and<00:03:34.890> then<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.730> gotcha<00:03:36.000> step<00:03:36.540> how<00:03:37.140> to

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
apply and then the gotcha step how to

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.280 
apply and then the gotcha step how to
actually<00:03:37.739> choose<00:03:38.459> the<00:03:38.820> effect<00:03:39.209> options<00:03:39.420> and

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
actually choose the effect options and

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.170 
actually choose the effect options and
then<00:03:40.530> we'll<00:03:40.800> walk<00:03:41.040> through<00:03:41.100> each<00:03:41.670> of<00:03:41.820> the

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
then we'll walk through each of the

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.500 
then we'll walk through each of the
customizations<00:03:43.140> for<00:03:43.230> timing<00:03:43.739> and<00:03:44.130> speed<00:03:44.550> I'm

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
customizations for timing and speed I'm

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.170 
customizations for timing and speed I'm
able<00:03:45.840> to<00:03:45.930> zoom<00:03:46.440> in<00:03:47.010> so<00:03:47.340> especially<00:03:47.580> when<00:03:48.030> it's

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
able to zoom in so especially when it's

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.440 
able to zoom in so especially when it's
a<00:03:48.269> gotcha<00:03:48.630> step<00:03:49.050> i<00:03:49.200> zoom<00:03:49.769> in<00:03:50.130> and<00:03:50.670> I<00:03:50.820> stress

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
a gotcha step i zoom in and I stress

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.290 
a gotcha step i zoom in and I stress
this<00:03:52.080> is<00:03:52.320> the<00:03:52.470> one<00:03:52.709> step<00:03:53.100> that<00:03:53.130> you<00:03:53.370> don't<00:03:53.880> want

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
this is the one step that you don't want

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.660 
this is the one step that you don't want
to<00:03:54.390> forget<00:03:54.570> when<00:03:55.410> you're<00:03:55.560> learning<00:03:56.130> this<00:03:56.310> tip

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
to forget when you're learning this tip

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.660 
to forget when you're learning this tip
and<00:03:57.000> I'll<00:03:57.660> walk<00:03:58.050> you<00:03:58.320> through<00:03:58.709> each<00:03:58.950> of<00:03:59.550> the

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
and I'll walk you through each of the

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.630 
and I'll walk you through each of the
steps<00:03:59.910> for<00:04:00.600> customizing<00:04:01.590> and<00:04:01.739> choosing<00:04:02.430> and

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
steps for customizing and choosing and

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.100 
steps for customizing and choosing and
seeing<00:04:03.090> your<00:04:03.420> options<00:04:04.820> finally<00:04:05.820> we<00:04:06.180> see<00:04:06.570> how

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
seeing your options finally we see how

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.620 
seeing your options finally we see how
this<00:04:07.440> all<00:04:07.680> comes<00:04:07.980> together<00:04:08.310> so<00:04:09.239> in<00:04:09.510> this

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
this all comes together so in this
