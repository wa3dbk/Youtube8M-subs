00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.250
 adventure on the channel today we start a 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.880
 new series welcome 6 all to 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.430
 first episode of the go for the 25 0 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.310
 in weapons game I had a lot 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.810
 of wanting to start this series and nothing 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.380
 What do I do in the main medium? 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.289
 give him cane 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.689
 we are in river started started let's go 0 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.640
 to 15 voucher does not pass or half we will give 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.960
 cane to boys we wait with series 1 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.340
 of you do that the order does not change and a 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.989
 which I forgot to comment in the 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.680
 first video of when the game came out 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.079
 weapons 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.510
 I uploaded a gameplay in 2.0 is that 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.100
 in this game there is no active radar acosta 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.329
 that man puts but already dead is 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.340
 which is the first game of the day gone a 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.410
 little bit lacking in precision but good not 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.930
 nothing happens, that is, there is no active radar 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.239
 in other colors because there was always the 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.550
 radar by waves and it was coming out of you 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.860
 was the people in this game is not worth what 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.570
 we kill perfect as I always tell you 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.920
 to try to get the 25 but good 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.230
 the funny thing is that we can no longer 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.000
 to die or it's already late we see the pressure 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.979
 that we can not die in any 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.780
 moment of departure and whenever 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.270
 play around the edges of the map 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.940
 is where the enemy backups are 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.440
 so we 're not going there 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.460
 to be close here although it is not 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.690
 plan to stay all the time in the 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.810
 same site because then people 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.340
 comes and all that one behind I also think 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.360
 right now so I 'm going to throw in 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.360
 here I will put now 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.440
 but I piro the accommodations there goes the 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.840
 punch we will change respawn 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.890
 because if we have already heated it up enough 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.190
 so let's see what's going on 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.190
 here 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:43.490
 the avatar runs runs runs runs 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.840
 Run Run Run Run Run I do not know 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.460
 how much streak I will get this first 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.229
 episode but I want to make it clear guys 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.119
 that even if they kill me, I'm going to finish the 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.970
 heading to the end okay it's not going to 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.350
 have the time that they kill me and even 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.149
 taking the game and that's where the 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.890
 chapter because it would be very short and what 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.289
 funny is also to finish the game 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.580
 to see how we are out there that I'm going to 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:02.780
 take a long time to silence what to see 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.210
 quiet 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.560
 I discovered recently that you can 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.149
 silencing people from here you know 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.319
 giving him the x you see how they are silenced that 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.910
 I thought I was getting into the menu 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.440
 but you can not silence from there to 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.880
 all this the chivas with 20 casualties yo 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.939
 get so let's hurry 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:20.870
 because we burst forth we go 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:22.999
 we started firing him before 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.790
 appear to kill him sure we have one 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:27.290
 down there well aired renew the cannons 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.230
 because put that there are two uncle cannons 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:35.480
 I will never understand the truth 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.890
 look for the ruthless option and I do not know how 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.230
 goal goes that man or if he did 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.290
 putting the six crossed magnet and potenza 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.870
 for the mother of God there was so much 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.710
 luck up to this being more frantic 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.850
 what I thought 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:52.170
 we go well the air is that the good thing that 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.510
 you have to change super weapons 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.820
 fast and it is given a super frontage 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.470
 Well, well, that's not the game, punch me 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.000
 humiliation now having seen the medal 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.130
 of humiliation I did not know it was 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.370
 we were inexorable that we got out 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.650
 the DNA when he killed it too the s12 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.060
 is about the kind of weapons you go with 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.270
 she does not matter how I'm going to kill now 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.220
 with a run of 15 that I carry you know 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:16.490
 do not 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.770
 how is she or my mother if I miter her and 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:21.290
 nobody so much cadiz and I can not 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.600
 believe my mother mine if it was close 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.150
 guys is not magazine with the shotgun and 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.580
 it kills me I can not believe that a rat of 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.350
 15 you pull me out there is super fast in your 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.780
 third good that's a car call 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.840
 competitive kills my mother what weapon more 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.460
 bad or is that this kind of weapons when 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.230
 give them to me and go on a run as per 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.780
 example before then it will happen to you many 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.490
 Sometimes that guy is going to bust a 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.140
 pity we can trace the game with 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.940
 the uncle is razor know this is a 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.380
 joke is that we have already started too 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.110
 when I went a lot of casualties and also 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.370
 we have been a little slow because 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.680
 you can not go too fast to 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.810
 take off the streak I will not raise the 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.730
 just measure power that does not die but 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.040
 I do not know how I'm waiting for 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:04.370
 see if a wall appears and this happens 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.020
 red please that we were back 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.790
 has not come down this man my mother did not me 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.860
 Kill this is awesome 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.110
 he had never put up with so many bullets 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.780
 this my mother weapon 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.090
 rw 1 when I see this gun uncle was already 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.549
 on a roll, it 's very fucked up because you have to 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.650
 give it a close up shot and very closely if 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.380
 does not happen that gives you heijn marker super 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.390
 difficult come on sometimes it seems that it gives 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.760
 it is but he does not enter the Havana this weapon 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.560
 it's super fucked uncle going to have weapons is 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.990
 class of a very complicated series dudes 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.460
 involved this series in weapons game 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.080
 the first episodes let's say they come out 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.460
 easy because I do not have the pressure either 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.110
 of having to take a super high streak 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.210
 but already the following 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.860
 it is impossible to be hand kills in this 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.900
 gun when I get it and go on a roll or 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.350
 improvement over here and suddenly the ciese does not 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.870
 win 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.970
 and no one and mark is that it is all kills 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.240
 uncle has to be a centimeter I want to 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.009
 kill someone with this weapon for god 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.750
 Where is where is the rock? 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:58.750
 here all the time up 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.729
 is super far and so neither is this weapon 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.949
 it's a wonderful shit but when I 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:09.410
 see this and go on a run of how much is going to 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:11.180
 be 19 or something like that but how do you want 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:14.210
 that kill with this percent boys 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:16.099
 a little thing to dénia as I have skated there 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:19.550
 on the ground and you have camps iluso played 

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:21.050
 lad go saying what good 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.160
 I have seen in live to me it has not happened to me 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.599
 seen in videos of people who have 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.780
 uploaded weapons game and all that there 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:29.830
 like a real good bug lol ala has been 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.789
 committed the same and they have given me 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.470
 my mother this weapon how bad it is 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:35.479
 also what I was telling you guys 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.580
 tedium that happens of me this is incredible 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:40.250
 balls is going on in this game a 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:43.039
 boy who carries with the crossbow and the uncle 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:45.919
 I was half an hour ago with 24 casualties because 

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:48.560
 did not receive the seen that you can not have 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:50.479
 been that uncle this man I'm for the 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.650
 another jewel because it will kill me today 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:53.479
 we are going to win the game because it seems 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:56.430
 that here people do not want to win it 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:06:01.050
 it's worth it since the longest game goes 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:02.520
 It's not the one you tell me if it's worth what 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.950
 it goes saying for example of action 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:09.290
 go down with some weapon or win the game 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:09.290
 uncle is not the one of the crossbow 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:15.140
 it seems to me just regular 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:28.310
 mine and cojones look at the game 

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:37.200
 cojones 26-4 that we have done to the 

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:39.180
 final go past a 15-0 streak 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.070
 I'm freaking things have happened very very 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.230
 strange to be the first episode 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:46.080
 It has been beautiful one thing that you 

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:49.260
 I mean guys if this video is very 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:51.090
 supported tomorrow I upload one of the best 

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.590
 random they come out that I will never go up what 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:55.529
 I mean seriously I have a little thing ready 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:58.199
 I'm just going to show you one thing 

00:06:55.529 --> 00:07:00.089
 I've seen what that is, it does not matter tomorrow 

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:01.949

00:07:00.089 --> 00:07:04.079
 is supported very rare episode I do not know this 

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:06.089

00:07:04.079 --> 00:07:09.109
 delighted and see you in the next 

00:07:06.089 --> 00:07:09.109
