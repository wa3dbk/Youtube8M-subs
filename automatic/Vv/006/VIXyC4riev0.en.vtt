00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 and the sponsor of this release is 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.400
 game project drift dreams 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.740
 at the moment the project is on 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.019
 development stage but it would have passed recently 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.450
 this testing server players stayed 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:21.410
 pretty connecting go link in

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.169
 I 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.990
 Good day dear friends 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.300
 today we will see a game project 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.170
 who once had a fairly wide 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.630
 popularity 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.090
 but now he has surrendered his positions online on 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:52.300
 server is not particularly high on average 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.160
 online reaches 130 and man and go 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.260
 specifically to the server me very 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.480
 pleased that when registering you 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.940
 You can choose a Kim of the 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.310
 different layers from poor to less 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.140
 rich therefore absolutely any 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.260
 your chosen role may be 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.600
 implemented when you first log into the server 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.850
 you are welcomed by a bot assistant who 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.619
 introduced himself as jimmy he will 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.990
 help you along the way with 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:19.150
 project mobility problems on 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.130
 server you do not have if in 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.979
 you will have at least a pocket 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.759
 25 bucks is exactly the rent 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.550
 scooter 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:30.250
 but even those 25 bucks for working wrong 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.470
 after all, it's a bit of a soul to get 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.200
 at least 100 dollars is already huge 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.210
 Problem by the way about a side job to us 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.060
 three different places are offered for 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.550
 works this is a sawmill food factory and 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.380
 mine arrived at the plant we come to 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.479
 changing rooms and changing clothes 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.819
 although of course our character is not 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.399
 changes to work and we work in that 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:53.950
 same who we walk on the street and which 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.869
 is our everyday wear not 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.770
 quite competent decision from 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.470
 developers 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.420
 although they might like to say that 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.600
 the player must buy work clothes 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.910
 doing well himself 10 boxes at the factory 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.700
 we go sell them to the warehouse which 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:12.310
 are there and get 6 dollars 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.140
 for 10 boxes on the server right away 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.319
 says that if you say 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.330
 zadonatili would get more on 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.310
 sawmill all the same in addition to 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.530
 this to me in some incredible way 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.830
 managed to get 3 7 on heavy 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.420
 drugs and 3 7 on light drugs 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.670
 where did they come from there to me just 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.040
 clear on the server there is a system 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.260
 inventory but it may not immediately be 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.170
 clear and I have a question again 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.670
 to the developers why so complicate 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.400
 can no longer be simplified 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.530
 interaction with the inventory to the player 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.390
 it was easier here is the opposite 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.720
 iraq cuts make a game on server 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:52.270
 how can hardcore be not just about 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.920
 plant I took a few clues coming to 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.200
 which we can interact with 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.900
 them and call the police but on call 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.250
 Of course, no one will come shortly 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.319
 rp level on server 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.750
 he is not so tall here as about him 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.769
 they say I watched for a long time 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.840
 one situation 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:11.230
 near unity train station 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.209
 station and I saw this picture 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.830
 understood this old man just overtook 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.880
 cops ie committed 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.489
 ordinary maneuver 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.950
 overtaking advancing a car with departure 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.110
 oncoming lane on them 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.569
 it seemed like a gross violation and they 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.060
 decided to fine him I intervened in their 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:29.980
 dialogue but no one listened to me 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.470
 what can I say garbage 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.019
 they and africa trash around this place 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.330
 a lot of people have accumulated and here 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:39.819
 what amused me during this rp 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.250
 situation there drove the car with 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.799
 two young people and in the hands of one 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.450
 of them I saw a shotgun maybe 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:49.890
 if the police were less there 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:52.720
 there would be a real skirmish 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.130
 There is nothing to say about the interior 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.709
 most of them are just 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.260
 standard single player interiors 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.950
 gta san andreas changed only the interior 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.690
 the hospital which by the way is well executed 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.760
 before the project site which is made 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.280
 also seemingly seemingly not 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.270
 especially if it is clear but fumbled it 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.270
 connection 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:15.250
 15 everything becomes clear and already possible 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.290
 You can understand the site 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.360
 view your detailed info 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.060
 character and see detailed 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.790
 monitoring home and business players in 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.620
 the state has done everything so that the player has 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.080
 convenient to view prices 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.660
 the real estate of interest on the forum 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.420
 also there is absolutely everything that is required 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:37.240
 Years of playing on other than standard themes 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.680
 such as rp biography of the situation here 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.900
 added diaries 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.470
 these are some notes of the server players 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.580
 something like the introduction of a personal diary 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.520
 It will be interesting to those who like to read 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:51.130
 books about the design of the forum and the site I 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.440
 I will say briefly in principle, normal, but we 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.750
 with you have seen better do not understand only 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.810
 one thing why places are all familiar 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.430
 avatars use image here 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.470
 your character in the game 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.910
 Well, I say goodbye to you on this our review 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.330
 came to an end 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:10.030
 my rating to this server is 6 out of 10 thanks 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.620
