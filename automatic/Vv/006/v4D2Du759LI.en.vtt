00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:01.639 

so<00:00:55.480> here's<00:00:55.780> the<00:00:55.930> tailgate<00:00:58.320> from<00:00:59.320> the<00:00:59.440> inside

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
so here's the tailgate from the inside

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.260 
so here's the tailgate from the inside
basically<00:01:02.649> I<00:01:03.010> just<00:01:05.070> got<00:01:06.070> my<00:01:06.250> dremel<00:01:06.700> tool<00:01:06.970> and

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
basically I just got my dremel tool and

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.510 
basically I just got my dremel tool and
estimated<00:01:07.930> where<00:01:08.110> I<00:01:08.140> thought<00:01:08.500> this<00:01:08.860> housing

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
estimated where I thought this housing

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.560 
estimated where I thought this housing
right<00:01:09.729> here<00:01:10.090> was<00:01:11.640> now<00:01:12.640> this<00:01:12.880> hole<00:01:13.180> right<00:01:13.210> here

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
right here was now this hole right here

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.969 
right here was now this hole right here
I<00:01:13.840> cut<00:01:14.290> through<00:01:15.300> so<00:01:16.300> my<00:01:16.780> first<00:01:17.080> cut<00:01:17.409> was<00:01:17.710> not

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
I cut through so my first cut was not

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:19.890 
I cut through so my first cut was not
quite<00:01:18.310> on<00:01:18.520> and<00:01:18.880> I<00:01:18.940> wasn't<00:01:19.180> sure<00:01:19.360> what<00:01:19.479> I<00:01:19.690> was

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
quite on and I wasn't sure what I was

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.350 
quite on and I wasn't sure what I was
looking<00:01:20.229> at<00:01:20.350> I<00:01:20.680> would<00:01:21.430> have<00:01:21.580> loved<00:01:21.909> to<00:01:22.149> have

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
looking at I would have loved to have

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.440 
looking at I would have loved to have
the<00:01:22.630> measurements<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:24.369> exactly<00:01:25.060> where<00:01:25.240> that

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
the measurements of exactly where that

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.690 
the measurements of exactly where that
housing<00:01:26.020> was<00:01:26.220> before<00:01:27.220> I<00:01:27.250> cut<00:01:27.640> in<00:01:29.369> so<00:01:30.369> I<00:01:30.399> cut

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
housing was before I cut in so I cut

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.240 
housing was before I cut in so I cut
this<00:01:30.880> area<00:01:31.270> out<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:33.210> then<00:01:34.210> basically<00:01:35.250> the

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
this area out and then basically the

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.700 
this area out and then basically the
cable<00:01:37.229> runs<00:01:38.229> into<00:01:38.649> the<00:01:38.800> housing<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:41.470> it's

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
cable runs into the housing and it's

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.930 
cable runs into the housing and it's
right<00:01:41.950> there<00:01:42.280> so<00:01:43.030> you<00:01:43.119> can<00:01:43.330> always<00:01:43.479> open<00:01:44.050> it

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
right there so you can always open it

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.169 
right there so you can always open it
there<00:01:45.940> should<00:01:46.179> be<00:01:46.330> a<00:01:46.360> hole<00:01:46.600> there<00:01:46.840> anyways<00:01:47.259> I

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:48.179 
there should be a hole there anyways I

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:53.160 
there should be a hole there anyways I
do<00:01:49.179> not<00:01:49.570> recommend<00:01:50.880> trying<00:01:51.880> to<00:01:52.179> use<00:01:52.420> this<00:01:52.869> hole

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
do not recommend trying to use this hole

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.370 
do not recommend trying to use this hole
back<00:01:53.619> here<00:01:54.070> that<00:01:54.340> everybody<00:01:54.700> else<00:01:55.380> talks

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
back here that everybody else talks

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.719 
back here that everybody else talks
about<00:01:57.929> you<00:01:58.929> can<00:01:59.170> monkey<00:01:59.560> with<00:01:59.770> it<00:01:59.800> for<00:02:00.310> hours

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
about you can monkey with it for hours

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.690 
about you can monkey with it for hours
on<00:02:00.940> hours<00:02:01.509> and<00:02:01.800> it<00:02:02.800> probably<00:02:03.369> won't<00:02:03.580> work

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
on hours and it probably won't work

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.089 
on hours and it probably won't work
especially<00:02:04.119> if<00:02:04.660> the<00:02:04.899> clip<00:02:05.380> on<00:02:05.679> the<00:02:05.709> end<00:02:05.950> of<00:02:05.979> the

00:02:06.089 --> 00:02:06.099 
especially if the clip on the end of the

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:14.729 
especially if the clip on the end of the
cable<00:02:06.489> is<00:02:06.640> broken<00:02:07.619> so<00:02:08.619> something<00:02:09.280> that<00:02:10.650> is<00:02:13.739> 95

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
cable is broken so something that is 95

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.370 
cable is broken so something that is 95
to<00:02:15.010> 100<00:02:15.310> percent<00:02:15.640> sure<00:02:16.239> to<00:02:16.720> open<00:02:16.870> up<00:02:17.170> the

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
to 100 percent sure to open up the

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.040 
to 100 percent sure to open up the
tailgate<00:02:17.739> is<00:02:18.250> to<00:02:18.970> just<00:02:19.150> cut<00:02:19.450> a<00:02:19.480> hole<00:02:19.599> in<00:02:19.959> the

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
tailgate is to just cut a hole in the

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.830 
tailgate is to just cut a hole in the
housing<00:02:20.500> right<00:02:20.709> here<00:02:20.980> and<00:02:21.599> here's<00:02:22.599> what<00:02:22.810> I

want to measure from the right

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:53.709 
want to measure from the right
so<00:03:48.169> I'm<00:03:48.230> going<00:03:48.530> right<00:03:48.739> from<00:03:48.919> the<00:03:49.099> curve<00:03:52.719> the

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:53.719 
so I'm going right from the curve the

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:58.689 
so I'm going right from the curve the
curve<00:03:53.750> in<00:03:54.349> the<00:03:54.379> plastic<00:03:55.189> paneling<00:03:56.889> and<00:03:57.889> then

00:03:58.689 --> 00:03:58.699 
curve in the plastic paneling and then

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:03.099 
curve in the plastic paneling and then
straight<00:03:59.150> up<00:03:59.180> from<00:03:59.780> the<00:03:59.930> metal<00:04:01.780> five<00:04:02.780> and<00:04:03.049> a

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109 
straight up from the metal five and a

straight up from the metal five and a
half<00:04:03.169> inches<00:04:03.769> and<00:04:05.379> then<00:04:06.379> what<00:04:06.560> you<00:04:06.739> do

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.779 

is<00:04:13.689> used<00:04:14.530> a<00:04:14.739> hole<00:04:15.549> saw<00:04:15.909> you<00:04:16.539> might<00:04:16.720> have<00:04:16.900> to

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
is used a hole saw you might have to

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:23.460 
is used a hole saw you might have to
adapt<00:04:18.789> the<00:04:21.210> the<00:04:22.210> drill<00:04:22.539> in<00:04:22.750> the<00:04:22.930> middle<00:04:23.229> so

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
adapt the the drill in the middle so

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.189 
adapt the the drill in the middle so
it's<00:04:23.620> not<00:04:23.770> so<00:04:24.009> long<00:04:24.780> but<00:04:25.780> if<00:04:25.870> you<00:04:25.990> can<00:04:26.169> just

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:26.199 
it's not so long but if you can just

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:28.950 
it's not so long but if you can just
drill<00:04:26.650> a<00:04:26.680> single<00:04:27.250> hole<00:04:27.490> right<00:04:27.820> here<00:04:28.270> and<00:04:28.479> the

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
drill a single hole right here and the

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.050 
drill a single hole right here and the
plastic<00:04:29.560> instead<00:04:29.949> of<00:04:30.100> what<00:04:30.250> I've<00:04:30.430> done<00:04:30.460> with

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
plastic instead of what I've done with

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.040 
plastic instead of what I've done with
the<00:04:31.180> dremel<00:04:33.000> you<00:04:34.000> know<00:04:34.210> exactly<00:04:34.690> where<00:04:34.900> that

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
housing is once you get through there go

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.710 
housing is once you get through there go
through<00:04:42.520> the<00:04:42.639> housing<00:04:43.180> with<00:04:43.389> a<00:04:43.419> half-inch<00:04:45.720> and

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
through the housing with a half-inch and

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.230 
through the housing with a half-inch and
then<00:04:47.680> boom

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:57.980 

oops

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
and you're opened which is music to our

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.730 
and you're opened which is music to our
eyes<00:05:06.789> when<00:05:07.389> we're<00:05:07.599> trapped<00:05:08.020> in<00:05:08.229> the<00:05:08.349> back<00:05:08.530> of

right here
like<00:05:54.100> I<00:05:54.340> did<00:05:55.710> with<00:05:56.710> a<00:05:56.740> half<00:05:57.070> inch<00:05:57.310> bit<00:06:00.000> that'll

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
like I did with a half inch bit that'll

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.050 
like I did with a half inch bit that'll
get<00:06:01.150> you<00:06:01.300> right<00:06:01.510> to<00:06:01.690> that<00:06:01.720> wire<00:06:02.170> in<00:06:02.470> there<00:06:03.060> not

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.060 
get you right to that wire in there not

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:08.340 
get you right to that wire in there not
sure<00:06:04.330> if<00:06:04.420> I<00:06:04.510> can<00:06:04.570> get<00:06:04.750> closer<00:06:05.170> view<00:06:05.620> that<00:06:07.350> once

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.350 
sure if I can get closer view that once

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:09.840 
sure if I can get closer view that once
you<00:06:08.530> get<00:06:08.680> the<00:06:08.860> door<00:06:09.070> open

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:09.850 
you get the door open

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:20.170 
you get the door open
it's<00:06:10.810> an<00:06:11.020> easy<00:06:11.260> fix

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.090 

but<00:06:21.180> getting<00:06:21.660> the<00:06:21.750> door<00:06:21.990> open<00:06:22.470> there's<00:06:22.800> a<00:06:22.860> lot

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:23.100 
but getting the door open there's a lot

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.710 
but getting the door open there's a lot
of<00:06:23.220> emotional<00:06:23.790> blocks<00:06:24.560> involved<00:06:25.560> and<00:06:26.720> you

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 
of emotional blocks involved and you

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.780 
of emotional blocks involved and you
might<00:06:27.900> let<00:06:28.170> it<00:06:28.290> sit<00:06:28.620> for<00:06:28.920> a<00:06:28.950> long<00:06:29.130> time<00:06:29.550> you

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:29.790 
might let it sit for a long time you

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:33.380 
might let it sit for a long time you
might<00:06:29.970> think<00:06:30.210> about<00:06:30.330> selling<00:06:30.990> your<00:06:31.080> lr3<00:06:32.390> those

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:33.390 
might think about selling your lr3 those

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:37.870 
might think about selling your lr3 those

we<00:06:38.880> understand<00:06:42.170> that<00:06:43.170> these<00:06:43.410> can<00:06:43.650> be

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:43.770 
we understand that these can be

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.970 
we understand that these can be
difficult<00:06:44.280> vehicles<00:06:45.140> but<00:06:46.140> most<00:06:46.380> of<00:06:46.530> us<00:06:46.680> would

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:46.980 
difficult vehicles but most of us would

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.770 
difficult vehicles but most of us would
buy<00:06:47.160> another<00:06:47.370> one<00:06:47.730> again<00:06:48.090> because<00:06:48.360> it<00:06:48.510> drives

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:48.780 
buy another one again because it drives
