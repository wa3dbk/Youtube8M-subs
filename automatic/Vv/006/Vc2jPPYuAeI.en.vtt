old<00:00:29.099> school<00:00:29.670> hinder<00:00:30.179> really<00:00:31.109> really<00:00:31.470> i<00:00:31.619> think

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
old school hinder really really i think

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.560 
old school hinder really really i think
it's<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.070> custom<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.640> think<00:00:32.790> it's<00:00:32.910> fully<00:00:33.180> thing

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
it's a custom I think it's fully thing

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.630 
it's a custom I think it's fully thing
is<00:00:33.719> like<00:00:33.870> nowadays<00:00:34.170> stuff<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:35.250> could<00:00:35.520> be

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
is like nowadays stuff it could be

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.910 
is like nowadays stuff it could be
because<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.390> screws<00:00:36.870> are<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.710> same

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
because the the screws are the same

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.440 
because the the screws are the same
pivot<00:00:38.190> screw<00:00:38.280> will<00:00:38.550> use<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:38.910> on<00:00:39.000> this<00:00:39.120> folder

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
pivot screw will use is on this folder

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.450 
pivot screw will use is on this folder
so<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.719> might<00:00:39.870> it's<00:00:40.260> really<00:00:40.649> really<00:00:41.280> cool

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460
