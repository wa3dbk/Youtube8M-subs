okay<00:00:00.960> here's<00:00:01.170> a<00:00:01.230> situation<00:00:02.010> that<00:00:02.040> I<00:00:02.159> run<00:00:02.520> into

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
okay here's a situation that I run into

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.299 
okay here's a situation that I run into
often<00:00:04.430> more<00:00:05.430> often<00:00:05.670> than<00:00:06.830> most<00:00:07.830> people<00:00:08.189> even

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
often more often than most people even

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.820 
often more often than most people even
think<00:00:08.639> about<00:00:08.849> but<00:00:09.330> you<00:00:10.019> have<00:00:10.050> a<00:00:10.830> step<00:00:11.639> you<00:00:12.830> have

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
think about but you have a step you have

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.540 
think about but you have a step you have
three<00:00:14.190> steps<00:00:14.580> with<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.030> same<00:00:15.389> size<00:00:15.870> tread

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
three steps with the same size tread

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.429 
three steps with the same size tread
thickness<00:00:17.550> each<00:00:17.970> one<00:00:18.449> of<00:00:18.600> these<00:00:18.750> is<00:00:19.050> an<00:00:19.199> inch

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
thickness each one of these is an inch

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.640 
thickness each one of these is an inch
and<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.680> half<00:00:20.150> thickness<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.390> then<00:00:22.199> we<00:00:22.350> come<00:00:22.619> up

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
and a half thickness and then we come up

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.300 
and a half thickness and then we come up
to<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:24.619> deck<00:00:25.619> or<00:00:26.099> even<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.730> floor<00:00:27.090> that<00:00:28.019> has<00:00:28.380> 3/4

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
to a deck or even a floor that has 3/4

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.440 
to a deck or even a floor that has 3/4
inch<00:00:29.599> plywood<00:00:31.250> 3/4<00:00:32.250> inch<00:00:32.430> OSB<00:00:32.610> now<00:00:33.239> in<00:00:33.360> this

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
inch plywood 3/4 inch OSB now in this

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.100 
inch plywood 3/4 inch OSB now in this
case<00:00:33.660> it's<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:33.989> sample<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.739> have<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.920> 1/2<00:00:35.219> inch

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
case it's a sample I have a 1/2 inch

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.270 
case it's a sample I have a 1/2 inch
piece<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.140> OSB<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.989> as<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.260> can<00:00:40.379> see<00:00:40.440> here<00:00:41.100> I

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
piece of OSB and as you can see here I

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.569 
piece of OSB and as you can see here I
have<00:00:42.180> seven<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.140> half<00:00:43.379> inches<00:00:46.430> seven<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.550> a

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
have seven and a half inches seven and a

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.930 
have seven and a half inches seven and a
half<00:00:47.610> inches<00:00:48.649> and<00:00:49.649> when<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:49.890> come<00:00:50.100> up<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.370> here<00:00:50.820> I

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
half inches and when I come up to here I

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.990 
half inches and when I come up to here I
have<00:00:51.420> six<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.930> half<00:00:51.960> inches<00:00:52.730> now<00:00:53.730> why<00:00:53.940> is

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
have six and a half inches now why is

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.619 
have six and a half inches now why is
that<00:00:54.210> that's<00:00:54.750> because<00:00:55.730> they<00:00:56.730> didn't<00:00:57.180> allow

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
that that's because they didn't allow

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:04.429 
that that's because they didn't allow
for<00:00:59.690> the<00:01:00.690> difference<00:01:01.320> in<00:01:01.850> between<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.719> floor

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
for the difference in between the floor

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.210 
for the difference in between the floor
sheeting<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.850> tread<00:01:06.090> thickness<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:07.619> this

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
sheeting and the tread thickness so this

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.990 
sheeting and the tread thickness so this
to<00:01:08.850> fix<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:09.650> this<00:01:10.650> would<00:01:11.010> actually<00:01:11.280> need<00:01:11.760> to

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
to fix this this would actually need to

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.660 
to fix this this would actually need to
lower<00:01:12.330> an<00:01:13.189> inch<00:01:14.750> so<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.259> again<00:01:16.680> it's<00:01:17.250> not<00:01:17.400> hard

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
lower an inch so and again it's not hard

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.249 
lower an inch so and again it's not hard
to<00:01:17.820> figure<00:01:18.000> out<00:01:18.180> since<00:01:18.780> we<00:01:18.990> have<00:01:20.900> we<00:01:21.900> can<00:01:22.080> see

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
to figure out since we have we can see

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.800 
to figure out since we have we can see
that<00:01:22.409> where<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:23.150> looks<00:01:24.150> like<00:01:24.330> six<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.720> a

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
that where it looks like six and a

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.570 
that where it looks like six and a
quarter<00:01:24.990> six<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.860> three-eighths<00:01:26.280> right

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
quarter six and three-eighths right

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.370 
quarter six and three-eighths right
there<00:01:27.619> you<00:01:28.619> would<00:01:28.740> have<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.979> lower<00:01:29.220> this<00:01:30.380> now

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
there you would have to lower this now

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.350 
there you would have to lower this now
you<00:01:31.439> say<00:01:31.950> well<00:01:32.159> what<00:01:32.280> about<00:01:32.460> adding<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.240> the

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
you say well what about adding to the

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.080 
you say well what about adding to the
top<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.810> this<00:01:33.960> if<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.500> added<00:01:34.860> another<00:01:35.090> inch

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
top of this if you added another inch

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.550 
top of this if you added another inch
and<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.390> quarter<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:36.960> top<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.350> this<00:01:37.409> you

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
and a quarter to the top of this you

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.819 
and a quarter to the top of this you
would<00:01:37.650> have<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.829> add<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.520> entire<00:01:38.939> floor

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
would have to add it to the entire floor

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:42.830 
would have to add it to the entire floor
or<00:01:40.829> landing<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.700> landing<00:01:42.150> wouldn't<00:01:42.450> be<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.570> big

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
or landing a landing wouldn't be a big

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.310 
or landing a landing wouldn't be a big
deal<00:01:43.049> if<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.649> stairs<00:01:43.979> were<00:01:44.340> coming<00:01:44.850> up<00:01:45.320> here

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
deal if the stairs were coming up here

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.950 
deal if the stairs were coming up here
and<00:01:46.500> then<00:01:47.100> going<00:01:47.369> back<00:01:47.880> up<00:01:48.530> to<00:01:50.659> another<00:01:51.659> side

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
and then going back up to another side

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.740 
and then going back up to another side
like<00:01:52.229> an<00:01:52.380> L<00:01:52.500> shape<00:01:52.710> but<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.950> floor<00:01:53.490> if<00:01:54.299> this<00:01:54.570> was

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
like an L shape but a floor if this was

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.109 
like an L shape but a floor if this was
your<00:01:54.930> floor<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:56.369> had<00:01:56.579> two<00:01:56.939> or<00:01:57.090> three

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
your floor and you had two or three

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.670 
your floor and you had two or three
bedrooms<00:01:57.719> up<00:01:57.960> there<00:01:58.140> in<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.320> couple<00:01:58.590> of

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
bedrooms up there in a couple of

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.380 
bedrooms up there in a couple of
bathrooms<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:59.670> can<00:01:59.820> see<00:01:59.969> where<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.210> would<00:02:00.270> be

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
bathrooms you can see where it would be

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.130 
bathrooms you can see where it would be
a<00:02:00.420> problem<00:02:00.810> so<00:02:01.710> make<00:02:02.159> sure<00:02:02.570> that<00:02:03.570> if<00:02:03.899> there's

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
a problem so make sure that if there's

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.459 
a problem so make sure that if there's
any<00:02:04.490> variations<00:02:05.490> in<00:02:05.880> your<00:02:06.119> floor<00:02:06.659> or<00:02:06.960> your

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
any variations in your floor or your

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.460 
any variations in your floor or your
decking<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.700> your<00:02:09.479> stair<00:02:09.780> treads<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:10.259> you

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
decking and your stair treads that you

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.010 
decking and your stair treads that you
adjust<00:02:10.619> for<00:02:11.550> it

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
adjust for it

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.920 
adjust for it
by<00:02:13.770> lowering<00:02:14.310> or<00:02:14.670> raising<00:02:14.700> your<00:02:15.540> ledger

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
by lowering or raising your ledger

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.700 
by lowering or raising your ledger
whatever<00:02:16.830> you<00:02:17.010> would<00:02:17.100> need<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:17.490> do
