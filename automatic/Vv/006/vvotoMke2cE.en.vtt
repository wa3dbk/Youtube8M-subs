00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:14.639
 Often vegans are called "radical". 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.780
 This is aimed at two things: First, the consistent and complete, 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.429
 So "radical" renouncement of all animal products - what applies to all vegans 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:28.060
 and on the other hand the confident and committed 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.890
 Who they explain or establish the background of their consumer choice 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.260
 To criticize actions as unethical and to change them. 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.870
 The term is quite vague and many people probably could not 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.970
 so easy to define, because he often expresses a kind of negative feeling. 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:49.329
 There are probably descriptions such as "reckless", "violent", "militant" or "extremist" 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.239
 in the back of the head and colloquially, the word is often used in this way. 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:59.109
 Even if you wanted to say something like that, the statement is that vegans are radical 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:03.339
 for another reason quite true because the term comes from the Latin word 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:05.100
 Radix off, which means root. 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:17.110
 Radical means, for example, that you are trying to attack problems at the root 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.600
 and from there to solve as comprehensively, fully and sustainably as possible, instead of trying 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.520
 Pruning or exaggerating excesses. 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.259
 And it means to do something fundamentally different instead of just striving for detail changes. 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.880
 And many vegans are striving for fundamental social changes - especially in dealing 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.479
 with animals, environmental resources and the impact that our daily consumer behavior 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:39.479
 on the environment. 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.829
 But since people do so little reluctantly as to change that is probably also a reason 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:47.600
 why this term is often used so negatively. 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.680
 Whether something that is radically operated is good or bad is itself 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.930
 not yet in it. 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.210
 Someone who is "radical" - that is, BASIC and CATEGORICAL - violence towards other people 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.270
 Avoiding, rejecting and trying to prevent, we would certainly not blame. 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.119
 In fact, eating no animals is something radically different to omnivore for many people 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.729
 Nutrition they were taught. 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.370
 And certainly you can discuss how people should not be overwhelmed as possible 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.060
 and can avoid defense reactions. 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.030
 But that does not mean that radical changes are bad or unnecessary per se. 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.790
 Anyhow, we can not continue and half-hearted lip service and 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.410
 cosmetic alibi acts will not help us because our numerous 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.530
 Big problems are not only superficial but also deeply rooted.
