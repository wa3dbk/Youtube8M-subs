00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
on consistency we hit on depth we hit on

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.769 
on consistency we hit on depth we hit on
placement<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:17.160> then<00:00:17.789> we<00:00:17.970> finally<00:00:18.300> got<00:00:18.539> to

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
placement and then we finally got to

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.920 
placement and then we finally got to
power<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.320> for<00:00:19.500> me<00:00:19.650> those<00:00:19.949> are<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.250> four

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
power and for me those are the four

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.720 
power and for me those are the four

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
uphill climb you know we get consistent

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.410 
uphill climb you know we get consistent
we<00:00:42.600> start<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:43.020> get<00:00:43.140> some<00:00:43.350> depth<00:00:44.000> we<00:00:45.000> start<00:00:45.300> to

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
we start to get some depth we start to

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.810 
we start to get some depth we start to
place<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.899> ball<00:00:46.050> pretty<00:00:46.379> well<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.980> we<00:00:47.280> get<00:00:47.700> to

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
place the ball pretty well and we get to

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.979 
place the ball pretty well and we get to
the<00:00:47.940> point<00:00:48.180> where<00:00:48.360> we're<00:00:48.480> hitting<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.809> ball

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
the point where we're hitting the ball

you know we hit the ball hard and we
lose<00:00:54.870> some<00:00:55.320> placement<00:00:56.010> or<00:00:56.100> we<00:00:56.219> lose<00:00:56.430> some

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
lose some placement or we lose some

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.880 
lose some placement or we lose some
depth<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:58.020> guys<00:00:58.199> have<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.620> treat<00:00:59.100> this

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
depth and you guys have to treat this

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.160 
depth and you guys have to treat this
again<00:01:01.890> as<00:01:02.070> building<00:01:02.550> blocks<00:01:02.579> if<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.840> start

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
again as building blocks if I start

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.020 
again as building blocks if I start
hitting<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.530> ball<00:01:04.739> for<00:01:05.040> power<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.640> lose

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
hitting the ball for power and I lose

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.960 
hitting the ball for power and I lose
any<00:01:06.540> one<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.140> those<00:01:07.380> other<00:01:07.650> foundations<00:01:08.460> I've

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
any one of those other foundations I've

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.420 
any one of those other foundations I've
got<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.720> drop<00:01:09.960> back<00:01:10.260> down<00:01:10.530> I've<00:01:10.740> got<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.920> scale

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
got to drop back down I've got a scale

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.770 
got to drop back down I've got a scale
back<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.150> get<00:01:12.960> back<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:14.060> whichever<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.360> that

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
back and get back to whichever that that

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.770 
back and get back to whichever that that
next<00:01:16.229> rung<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.770> so<00:01:17.189> if<00:01:17.369> my<00:01:17.850> powers<00:01:18.270> there<00:01:18.509> but<00:01:18.750> I

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
next rung is so if my powers there but I

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.859 
next rung is so if my powers there but I
lost<00:01:19.170> my<00:01:19.409> placement<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:20.159> got<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.119> start<00:01:21.360> hitting

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
lost my placement I got to start hitting

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.140 
lost my placement I got to start hitting
the<00:01:21.960> ball<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.170> little<00:01:22.590> little<00:01:23.520> softer<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.060> little

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
the ball a little little softer a little

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.170 
the ball a little little softer a little
slower<00:01:24.689> get<00:01:25.049> my<00:01:25.290> placement<00:01:25.650> back<00:01:26.070> once<00:01:26.970> it's

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
slower get my placement back once it's

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.450 
slower get my placement back once it's
back<00:01:27.390> start<00:01:27.990> bumping<00:01:28.259> up<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.770> power<00:01:29.040> again

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
back start bumping up that power again

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.819 
back start bumping up that power again
and<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:30.119> think<00:01:30.360> what<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.630> guys<00:01:30.780> will<00:01:31.079> find<00:01:31.409> is

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
and I think what you guys will find is

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.480 
and I think what you guys will find is
over<00:01:32.369> time<00:01:33.229> you<00:01:34.229> know<00:01:34.380> you'll<00:01:35.009> learn<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.369> hit

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
over time you know you'll learn to hit

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.310 
over time you know you'll learn to hit
the<00:01:35.610> ball<00:01:35.790> harder<00:01:36.270> you'll<00:01:36.689> learn<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:37.079> place

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
the ball harder you'll learn to place

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.170 
the ball harder you'll learn to place
the<00:01:37.530> ball<00:01:37.680> better<00:01:37.920> but<00:01:38.700> you'll<00:01:38.820> have<00:01:38.970> these

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
the ball better but you'll have these

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.380 
the ball better but you'll have these
little<00:01:39.390> herbs<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.079> flows<00:01:40.670> where<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:42.090> feel

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
little herbs and flows where you feel

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.210 
little herbs and flows where you feel
like<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.750> might<00:01:43.020> be<00:01:43.049> regressing<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.979> little

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
like you might be regressing a little

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.030 
like you might be regressing a little
bit<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.610> that's<00:01:44.970> okay

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
bit and that's okay

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.090 
bit and that's okay
tennis<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:47.220> going<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.729> be<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.880> lifelong<00:01:48.299> game

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
tennis is going to be a lifelong game

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.670 
tennis is going to be a lifelong game
just<00:01:50.100> know<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:51.240> overall<00:01:51.899> process

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
just know that the the overall process

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.580 
just know that the the overall process
you<00:01:53.040> will<00:01:53.220> be<00:01:53.280> getting<00:01:53.750> absolutely<00:01:54.750> better<00:01:55.350> at

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
you will be getting absolutely better at

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.490 
you will be getting absolutely better at
tennis<00:01:56.009> if<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.939> guys<00:01:57.090> can<00:01:57.420> follow<00:01:57.689> those<00:01:58.140> four
