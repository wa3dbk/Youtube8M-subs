00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
is getting and the capability that you

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.090 
is getting and the capability that you
have<00:05:08.700> in<00:05:08.880> such<00:05:09.090> package<00:05:09.510> is<00:05:09.600> a<00:05:09.630> trailhawk<00:05:10.200> and

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
have in such package is a trailhawk and

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.460 
have in such package is a trailhawk and
it's<00:05:11.520> it's<00:05:11.820> really<00:05:12.000> hard<00:05:12.270> to<00:05:12.390> beat<00:05:12.570> and<00:05:12.840> the

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
it's it's really hard to beat and the

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.380 
it's it's really hard to beat and the

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 
great part about it is that the price

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.440 
great part about it is that the price
point<00:05:15.720> is<00:05:15.930> so<00:05:16.380> much<00:05:16.680> lower<00:05:17.040> than<00:05:17.400> a<00:05:18.090> Grand

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
point is so much lower than a Grand

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.530 
point is so much lower than a Grand
Cherokee<00:05:19.010> so<00:05:20.010> this<00:05:20.250> is<00:05:20.430> more<00:05:21.240> of<00:05:21.390> your
