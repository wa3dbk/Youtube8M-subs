good<00:00:02.699> a<00:00:02.790> it's<00:00:03.000> bending<00:00:03.210> here<00:00:03.389> from<00:00:03.570> didgeridoo

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
good a it's bending here from didgeridoo

breath<00:00:04.259> and<00:00:04.650> I'm<00:00:04.920> gonna<00:00:05.009> talk<00:00:05.279> about<00:00:05.310> did<00:00:05.910> you

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
breath and I'm gonna talk about did you

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.490 
breath and I'm gonna talk about did you
redo<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.270> length<00:00:06.509> and<00:00:06.840> what<00:00:06.960> that<00:00:07.110> means<00:00:07.290> to

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
redo the length and what that means to

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.400 
redo the length and what that means to
you<00:00:07.650> so<00:00:08.360> in<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.509> organic<00:00:09.809> world<00:00:10.169> of

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:33.990 
the didge where do I start

what's<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.820> easiest<00:00:36.180> one<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.420> start<00:00:36.720> on<00:00:37.550> you

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
what's the easiest one to start on you

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.510 
what's the easiest one to start on you
can<00:00:38.700> say<00:00:38.880> that<00:00:39.120> for<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.600> lower<00:00:39.870> note<00:00:40.140> didge<00:00:40.520> you

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
can say that for a lower note didge you

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.130 
can say that for a lower note didge you
vibrate<00:00:41.790> your<00:00:42.150> lips<00:00:42.720> more<00:00:43.230> slowly<00:00:43.530> for<00:00:45.140> a

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
vibrate your lips more slowly for a

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.820 
vibrate your lips more slowly for a
small<00:00:46.410> did<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.920> vibrate<00:00:47.280> faster<00:00:48.560> to<00:00:49.560> get<00:00:49.680> the

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:49.830 
small did you vibrate faster to get the

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.010 
small did you vibrate faster to get the
note<00:00:50.040> and<00:00:50.970> I<00:00:51.030> could<00:00:51.180> demonstrate<00:00:51.330> this<00:00:51.690> on<00:00:51.900> the

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
note and I could demonstrate this on the

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.340 
note and I could demonstrate this on the
digibind<00:00:52.520> this<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:53.670> made<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.940> PVC<00:00:54.170> so<00:00:55.170> it's

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
digibind this is made of PVC so it's

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.920 
digibind this is made of PVC so it's
really<00:00:55.770> uniform<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.580> we<00:00:57.450> can<00:00:57.540> get<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.690> taste

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
really uniform and we can get a taste

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:08.710 
really uniform and we can get a taste
for<00:00:58.080> the<00:00:58.530> longer<00:00:58.830> the<00:00:58.950> deeper<00:00:59.250> yeah

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.030 

cool<00:01:09.720> huh<00:01:11.210> when<00:01:12.210> starting<00:01:12.510> out<00:01:12.810> we<00:01:13.710> here<00:01:13.979> at

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
cool huh when starting out we here at

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.830 
cool huh when starting out we here at
didgeridoo<00:01:14.250> breath<00:01:14.670> recommend<00:01:15.180> maybe<00:01:15.600> not

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
didgeridoo breath recommend maybe not

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.050 
didgeridoo breath recommend maybe not
going<00:01:16.110> for<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.440> extreme<00:01:17.010> deep<00:01:17.369> or<00:01:17.850> the

extreme high aims somewhere in the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.219 
extreme high aims somewhere in the
middle<00:01:20.190> and<00:01:20.960> you're<00:01:21.960> gonna<00:01:22.050> be<00:01:22.200> right<00:01:22.350> as<00:01:22.560> rain

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
middle and you're gonna be right as rain

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.219 
middle and you're gonna be right as rain
when<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.320> comes<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.820> non-plastic<00:01:27.229> eucalyptus

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229

when it comes to non-plastic eucalyptus
didgeridoos<00:01:28.740> there<00:01:29.310> are<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.490> variety<00:01:29.850> of

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
didgeridoos there are a variety of

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.850 
didgeridoos there are a variety of
factors<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.630> play<00:01:30.780> into<00:01:30.960> how<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.380> note<00:01:31.710> is

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
factors that play into how that note is

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.020 
factors that play into how that note is
achieved<00:01:32.190> and<00:01:33.170> we<00:01:34.170> like<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.500> say<00:01:34.680> here<00:01:34.920> that

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
achieved and we like to say here that

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.660 
achieved and we like to say here that
the<00:01:36.030> longer<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:37.320> didge<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:38.009> more<00:01:38.159> resonant

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
the longer the didge the more resonant

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.910 
the longer the didge the more resonant
it<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.869> can<00:01:40.050> find<00:01:40.320> two<00:01:40.649> didgeridoos

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
it is and you can find two didgeridoos

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.090 
it is and you can find two didgeridoos
in<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.640> same<00:01:41.880> note<00:01:42.119> say<00:01:42.630> f<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.590> could<00:01:43.740> find<00:01:43.950> a

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
in the same note say f you could find a

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.900 
in the same note say f you could find a
long<00:01:44.430> F<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.910> a<00:01:45.149> tinier<00:01:46.460> the<00:01:47.460> longer<00:01:47.729> one's

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
long F and a tinier the longer one's

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.580 
long F and a tinier the longer one's
going<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.149> have<00:01:48.300> more<00:01:48.630> resonance<00:01:49.170> the

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
going to have more resonance the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.230 
going to have more resonance the
resonant<00:01:50.009> frequency<00:01:50.430> has<00:01:50.550> got<00:01:50.700> much<00:01:51.030> more

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
resonant frequency has got much more

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.870 
resonant frequency has got much more
time<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.720> get<00:01:52.410> barely<00:01:52.830> into<00:01:53.039> that<00:01:53.190> into<00:01:53.700> that

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
time to get barely into that into that

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.690 
time to get barely into that into that
tunnel<00:01:54.330> and<00:01:55.160> we're<00:01:56.160> going<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.310> produce<00:01:56.460> a

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
tunnel and we're going to produce a

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.230 
tunnel and we're going to produce a
richer<00:01:57.030> sound<00:01:57.210> so<00:01:57.869> that's<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.110> good<00:01:58.229> general

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
richer sound so that's a good general

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.029 
richer sound so that's a good general

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
generalization for you on did we do

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:03.529 
generalization for you on did we do
length<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.520> how<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:02.940> affects<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.360> note
