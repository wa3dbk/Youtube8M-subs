00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.499 

I<00:00:03.890> made<00:00:04.890> this<00:00:05.069> end<00:00:05.250> table<00:00:05.370> for<00:00:05.700> my<00:00:05.819> couch<00:00:06.060> and

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
I made this end table for my couch and

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.089 
I made this end table for my couch and
I'm<00:00:06.810> gonna<00:00:06.930> show<00:00:07.200> you<00:00:07.259> a<00:00:07.410> few<00:00:07.680> of<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:07.859> steps

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
I'm gonna show you a few of the steps

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.310 
I'm gonna show you a few of the steps
that<00:00:08.490> I<00:00:08.580> went<00:00:08.849> through<00:00:08.910> in<00:00:09.630> order<00:00:09.809> to<00:00:09.900> build<00:00:10.080> it

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
that I went through in order to build it

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.249 
that I went through in order to build it
I<00:00:10.620> already<00:00:11.340> had<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:11.940> small<00:00:12.480> end<00:00:12.719> table<00:00:13.049> but<00:00:13.230> I

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
I already had a small end table but I

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.720 
I already had a small end table but I
wanted<00:00:13.500> one<00:00:13.679> that<00:00:13.769> was<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:13.920> little<00:00:14.190> bit<00:00:14.309> larger

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
wanted one that was a little bit larger

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.540 
wanted one that was a little bit larger
but<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.179> similar<00:00:15.540> design<00:00:16.100> this<00:00:17.100> was<00:00:17.369> made<00:00:17.520> out

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
but a similar design this was made out

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.720 
but a similar design this was made out
of<00:00:17.670> half-inch<00:00:18.119> copper<00:00:18.330> pipe<00:00:19.250> I'm<00:00:20.250> not<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.490> big

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
of half-inch copper pipe I'm not a big

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.790 
of half-inch copper pipe I'm not a big
planner<00:00:21.060> so<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:21.359> made<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.600> few<00:00:21.840> sketches<00:00:22.170> just<00:00:22.680> to

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
planner so I made a few sketches just to

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.740 
planner so I made a few sketches just to
get<00:00:22.920> an<00:00:23.039> idea<00:00:23.670> for<00:00:23.730> parts

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.210 

there<00:00:27.750> aren't<00:00:27.930> many<00:00:28.019> tools<00:00:28.410> needed<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.949> solder

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
there aren't many tools needed to solder

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.349 
there aren't many tools needed to solder
water<00:00:29.490> pipe<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:29.939> they're<00:00:30.029> not<00:00:30.179> very

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
water pipe and they're not very

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.540 
water pipe and they're not very
expensive

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.040 

it's<00:00:35.550> amazing<00:00:35.910> how<00:00:36.030> accurate<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:36.719> could<00:00:36.899> be

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
it's amazing how accurate you could be

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.350 
it's amazing how accurate you could be
with<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.350> pipe<00:00:37.620> cutter<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:38.430> can<00:00:38.460> even<00:00:38.910> split<00:00:39.239> a

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
with a pipe cutter you can even split a

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.119 
with a pipe cutter you can even split a
pencil<00:00:39.930> line<00:00:40.140> if<00:00:40.320> you're<00:00:40.440> careful<00:00:42.829> I'm<00:00:43.829> using

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
pencil line if you're careful I'm using

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.639 
pencil line if you're careful I'm using
3/4<00:00:44.910> inch<00:00:45.059> copper<00:00:45.480> pipe<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:46.230> is<00:00:46.440> just

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
3/4 inch copper pipe this is just

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.529 
3/4 inch copper pipe this is just
standard<00:00:47.070> water<00:00:47.430> pipe<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.850> could<00:00:48.030> get<00:00:48.210> from

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
standard water pipe you could get from

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.529 
standard water pipe you could get from
Home<00:00:48.719> Depot<00:00:48.750> or<00:00:49.230> wherever<00:00:49.469> Lowe's<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:51.030> wanted

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
Home Depot or wherever Lowe's I wanted

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:52.910 
Home Depot or wherever Lowe's I wanted
to<00:00:51.660> have<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:51.960> since<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.500> was<00:00:52.620> going<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.800> be<00:00:52.890> a

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
to have a since it was going to be a

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.500 
to have a since it was going to be a
little<00:00:53.100> bit<00:00:53.219> larger<00:00:53.579> table<00:00:53.969> than<00:00:54.120> my<00:00:54.239> old<00:00:54.420> one

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
little bit larger table than my old one

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.630 
little bit larger table than my old one
I<00:00:54.660> thought<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.379> larger<00:00:55.770> diameter<00:00:55.949> would<00:00:56.460> give

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
I thought the larger diameter would give

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:10.480 
I thought the larger diameter would give
it<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.760> little<00:00:56.940> more<00:00:57.059> rigidity

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.660 

just<00:01:11.490> tighten<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.090> blade<00:01:12.360> as<00:01:12.660> you<00:01:13.170> rotate<00:01:13.680> the

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
just tighten the blade as you rotate the

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.300 
just tighten the blade as you rotate the
pipe<00:01:14.880> cutter<00:01:15.180> around<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.660> pipe<00:01:15.870> and<00:01:16.530> it'll

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
pipe cutter around the pipe and it'll

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.670 
pipe cutter around the pipe and it'll
give<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.670> very<00:01:18.240> clean<00:01:18.690> cut<00:01:21.110> my<00:01:22.110> design<00:01:22.440> for

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
give you a very clean cut my design for

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.070 
give you a very clean cut my design for
this<00:01:22.770> table<00:01:23.010> calls<00:01:23.400> for<00:01:23.760> a<00:01:23.790> cantilever<00:01:24.600> shelf

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
this table calls for a cantilever shelf

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.110 
this table calls for a cantilever shelf
so<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.620> shows<00:01:26.040> are<00:01:26.190> only<00:01:26.310> supported<00:01:26.820> on<00:01:26.910> one

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
so the shows are only supported on one

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.570 
so the shows are only supported on one
side<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.720> perfect<00:01:28.620> end<00:01:28.860> table<00:01:29.220> where<00:01:29.340> I'm<00:01:29.430> just

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
side a perfect end table where I'm just

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.430 
side a perfect end table where I'm just
gonna<00:01:29.670> hold<00:01:29.910> a<00:01:29.970> couple<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.330> glasses<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.870> the

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
gonna hold a couple of glasses and the

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.469 
gonna hold a couple of glasses and the
remote<00:01:31.740> control<00:01:32.160> it's<00:01:32.820> plenty<00:01:33.180> strong<00:01:33.360> enough

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
remote control it's plenty strong enough

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.480 
remote control it's plenty strong enough
and<00:01:33.840> plenty<00:01:34.140> stiff<00:01:34.380> enough<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.860> does<00:01:35.040> bounce<00:01:35.340> a

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
and plenty stiff enough it does bounce a

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.219 
and plenty stiff enough it does bounce a
little<00:01:35.700> bit<00:01:35.850> but<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.180> holds<00:01:36.750> fine

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
little bit but it holds fine

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.810 
little bit but it holds fine
if<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.710> were<00:01:37.800> gonna<00:01:37.920> build<00:01:38.310> something<00:01:38.610> that

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
if you were gonna build something that

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.310 
if you were gonna build something that
you<00:01:38.910> wanted<00:01:39.120> to<00:01:39.210> stand<00:01:39.479> on<00:01:39.750> or<00:01:39.930> put<00:01:40.080> a<00:01:40.110> heavy

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
you wanted to stand on or put a heavy

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.200 
you wanted to stand on or put a heavy
lamp<00:01:40.590> on<00:01:40.800> you're<00:01:41.280> gonna<00:01:41.370> want<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.700> put<00:01:42.060> some

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
lamp on you're gonna want to put some

00:01:42.210 --> 00:02:33.080 
lamp on you're gonna want to put some
other<00:01:42.600> some<00:01:42.990> extra<00:01:43.290> bracing<00:01:43.740> in<00:01:43.860> there

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.270 

my<00:02:34.090> original<00:02:34.270> sketch<00:02:34.780> I<00:02:34.930> planned<00:02:35.260> for<00:02:35.530> just

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
my original sketch I planned for just

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.520 
my original sketch I planned for just
one<00:02:36.550> shelf<00:02:36.880> on<00:02:37.090> each<00:02:37.270> end<00:02:37.600> table<00:02:38.170> but<00:02:38.380> I

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
one shelf on each end table but I

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.830 
one shelf on each end table but I
modified<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.400> plan<00:02:39.640> put<00:02:39.850> two<00:02:40.030> shelves<00:02:40.330> in<00:02:40.630> I

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
modified the plan put two shelves in I

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.480 
modified the plan put two shelves in I
was<00:02:41.500> thinking<00:02:41.800> the<00:02:41.860> shelves<00:02:42.160> would<00:02:42.250> be<00:02:42.340> the

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
was thinking the shelves would be the

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:49.530 
was thinking the shelves would be the
same<00:02:43.410> width<00:02:46.260> but<00:02:47.260> I<00:02:47.290> changed<00:02:47.590> my<00:02:47.770> plan<00:02:48.360> you<00:02:49.360> can

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
same width but I changed my plan you can

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.890 
same width but I changed my plan you can
see<00:02:49.690> that<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:50.020> new<00:02:50.350> tables<00:02:50.740> a<00:02:50.860> lot<00:02:51.720> wider<00:02:52.720> a

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
see that the new tables a lot wider a

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.800 
see that the new tables a lot wider a
lot<00:02:53.140> bigger<00:02:53.440> than<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:53.830> old<00:02:54.010> table<00:02:57.810> my

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
lot bigger than the old table my

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.420 
lot bigger than the old table my
original<00:02:59.170> plan<00:02:59.320> called<00:02:59.620> for<00:02:59.680> using<00:03:00.010> leftover

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
original plan called for using leftover

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.900 
original plan called for using leftover
four<00:03:00.790> pile<00:03:01.060> of<00:03:01.300> shelving<00:03:01.810> and<00:03:02.250> so<00:03:03.250> I<00:03:03.400> test

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
four pile of shelving and so I test
