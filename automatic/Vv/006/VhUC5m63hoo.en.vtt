about half the Bulls leave because what

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.410 
about half the Bulls leave because what
would<00:01:32.069> happen<00:01:32.520> is<00:01:32.869> when<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:33.899> talk<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.679> rifle

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
would happen is when I talk the rifle

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.719 
would happen is when I talk the rifle
this<00:01:36.420> cotton<00:01:36.810> piece<00:01:37.049> would<00:01:37.289> you<00:01:38.190> can<00:01:38.369> already

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
this cotton piece would you can already

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.919 
this cotton piece would you can already
see<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.330> little<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:40.259> moves<00:01:40.590> up<00:01:41.539> somewhat<00:01:42.539> right

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
see a little it moves up somewhat right

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:47.570 
see a little it moves up somewhat right
here<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.490> it<00:01:44.490> would<00:01:44.580> do<00:01:44.789> that<00:01:46.130> with<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.340> old

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
here and it would do that with the old

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.850 
here and it would do that with the old
poll<00:01:48.240> sleeve<00:01:48.569> and<00:01:48.810> cotton<00:01:49.350> piece<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.619> would<00:01:49.740> do

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
poll sleeve and cotton piece it would do

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.730 
poll sleeve and cotton piece it would do
that<00:01:50.039> a<00:01:50.069> lot<00:01:50.280> more<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:52.190> but<00:01:53.190> I<00:01:53.520> just<00:01:54.060> found<00:01:54.270> it

that well almost to the rear of the

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.899 
that well almost to the rear of the
trigger<00:02:27.370> guard<00:02:28.079> so<00:02:29.370> I've<00:02:30.370> also<00:02:30.610> put<00:02:30.849> a

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:30.909 
trigger guard so I've also put a

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:34.110 
trigger guard so I've also put a

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
different spring in there when I make

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.860 
different spring in there when I make
myself<00:02:34.329> out<00:02:34.870> of<00:02:36.209> like<00:02:37.980> this<00:02:39.000> sort<00:02:40.000> of<00:02:40.120> wire<00:02:40.450> I

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
myself out of like this sort of wire I

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.399 
myself out of like this sort of wire I
got<00:02:41.200> from<00:02:41.700> one<00:02:42.700> of<00:02:42.819> those<00:02:43.000> spirals<00:02:43.690> out<00:02:44.109> of<00:02:44.170> a

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:44.409 
got from one of those spirals out of a

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:49.800 
got from one of those spirals out of a
notebook<00:02:46.739> and<00:02:47.739> also<00:02:48.129> in<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.209> last<00:02:49.450> video<00:02:49.720> I

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
notebook and also in the last video I

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.190 
notebook and also in the last video I
said<00:02:50.109> item<00:02:51.150> replaced<00:02:52.150> a<00:02:52.389> magazine<00:02:52.870> spring

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
said item replaced a magazine spring

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.800 
said item replaced a magazine spring
which<00:02:53.500> I<00:02:53.769> did<00:02:54.190> so<00:02:55.170> now<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:58.090> bullets<00:02:58.510> are<00:02:58.629> being

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
which I did so now the bullets are being

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.710 
which I did so now the bullets are being
pushed<00:02:59.049> up<00:02:59.200> properly<00:02:59.680> and<00:03:00.840> I<00:03:03.090> can<00:03:04.090> feed<00:03:04.569> them

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
pushed up properly and I can feed them

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.840 
pushed up properly and I can feed them
into<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:05.019> chamber

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.940

getting there so also I've done a lot of
work<00:03:22.090> on<00:03:22.390> the<00:03:22.920> unimproved<00:03:23.920> in<00:03:24.070> the<00:03:24.220> extractor

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
work on the unimproved in the extractor

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.020 
work on the unimproved in the extractor
so<00:03:26.800> I<00:03:27.130> can<00:03:27.490> just<00:03:27.760> take<00:03:28.030> this<00:03:28.210> out<00:03:28.450> and<00:03:28.480> shall<00:03:29.320> we

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
so I can just take this out and shall we

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.330 
so I can just take this out and shall we
so<00:03:31.030> now<00:03:31.270> the<00:03:31.330> rounds<00:03:31.840> are<00:03:31.930> actually<00:03:32.290> being

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.310 

held<00:03:36.340> in<00:03:36.640> there<00:03:36.850> and<00:03:38.040> because<00:03:39.040> what<00:03:39.280> I<00:03:39.310> did<00:03:39.460> was

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
held in there and because what I did was

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.930 
held in there and because what I did was
on<00:03:41.320> those<00:03:41.590> two<00:03:41.860> little<00:03:42.070> pieces<00:03:42.370> right<00:03:42.580> here<00:03:42.880> I

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
on those two little pieces right here I

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.670 
on those two little pieces right here I
actually<00:03:43.710> put<00:03:44.710> some<00:03:45.100> layers<00:03:45.670> on<00:03:46.000> there<00:03:46.180> and

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
actually put some layers on there and

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.530 
actually put some layers on there and
fold<00:03:47.680> it<00:03:47.890> inwards<00:03:48.430> a<00:03:48.670> little<00:03:48.700> bit<00:03:49.120> so<00:03:49.300> now<00:03:49.330> that

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
fold it inwards a little bit so now that

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.530 
fold it inwards a little bit so now that
actually<00:03:50.220> who<00:03:51.220> gone<00:03:51.460> to<00:03:51.700> the<00:03:51.820> primer<00:03:52.150> instead

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
actually who gone to the primer instead

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.300 
actually who gone to the primer instead
of<00:03:52.630> just<00:03:52.870> holding<00:03:53.260> it<00:03:53.320> in<00:03:53.440> place<00:03:53.560> and<00:03:54.570> you<00:03:55.570> know

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
of just holding it in place and you know

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.050 
of just holding it in place and you know
also<00:03:57.310> when<00:03:57.670> the<00:03:58.210> bolts<00:03:58.510> in<00:03:58.660> the<00:03:58.890> receiver<00:03:59.890> to

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
also when the bolts in the receiver to

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.030 
also when the bolts in the receiver to
extract<00:04:01.060> the<00:04:01.150> bars<00:04:01.390> getting<00:04:01.720> pushed<00:04:02.680> inwards

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
extract the bars getting pushed inwards

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.010
