00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
three different setups but I think we're

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.990 
three different setups but I think we're
only<00:00:15.780> gonna<00:00:15.960> give<00:00:16.139> out<00:00:16.260> two<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:17.000> something

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
only gonna give out two to something

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.939 
only gonna give out two to something
like<00:00:18.270> I<00:00:18.359> said<00:00:18.510> with<00:00:18.630> action<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.350> then<00:00:19.500> some

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
like I said with action and then some

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.460 
like I said with action and then some
sort<00:00:20.250> of<00:00:20.310> standard<00:00:20.730> pose<00:00:20.939> along<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:22.050> wall<00:00:22.230> or

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
sort of standard pose along the wall or

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.130 
sort of standard pose along the wall or
something<00:00:22.650> like<00:00:22.859> that<00:00:23.390> our<00:00:24.390> biggest<00:00:24.660> problem

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140
