00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.760
 This is a good test, right? 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:10.740
 Are you doing it right here with japan? 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.259
 was marked easier on you if you 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.470
 You want to train to make diagram only 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:20.580
 eat training to use here or 22 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:25.500
 and the top 2122 of the team 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.880
 Let's do the monitoring that starts. 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.750
 always the middle line I marked my 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.929
 Medical'll do little more than outlines 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.929
 job 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:59.390
 that's just we did not have 15 to whom I went 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:15.290
 until tomorrow as the body makes it a 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.290
 lawn bow 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.700
 functional value of marina can not 

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:27.189
 to be of opinion program will give a little 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.630
 more work than you were here 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:33.560
 someone tried to follow up is 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:36.229
 easier too, then we'll go 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.569
 doing will put in the air that people 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:02:05.179
 have to be thinking the table will stay 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:02:09.049
 more expensive it is good you can stay in marquinhos 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:30.069
 when we give one of them with a good 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:31.730
 correct the issue of size everything goes to 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.560
 judgment 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.200
 so more or less now I'm going to give only one 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.299
 teamwork team fall into that ray 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.769
 because I 'm going to do it because I have 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.540
 that having a reference side can 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.730
 work to be just right 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.319
 at the time I ask a little bit I think 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.919
 that will stay more or less on top of 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:51.230
 ideal if it disappears and if this is 

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:54.500
 here put your mark on 15 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.160
 You can do this, it gives you 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.160
 training 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:21.700
 a little table that now seeks the 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:31.750
 pump no longer needs to be left with the 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:31.750
 balance 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.670
 some of you will make some notes 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.670
 but no 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.080
 but this is normal 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:57.820
 then we'll have to manage a 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:59.470
 little more will be able to prove the content 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:10.900
 what is going to happen concluded 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:28.930
 let me not take it, then we'll wait 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:37.980
 an hour's drive from the 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:37.980
 2009 he did more or less that's good
