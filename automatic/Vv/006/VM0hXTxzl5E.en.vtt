00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.269
 here 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.090
 doctor regarding the preparation of 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.960
 the breasts during pregnancy that 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.960
 I recommend to you 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.270
 the chest does not need large 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.550
 preparations the same organism is 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.110
 responsible for strengthening that skin and 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.930
 moisturize the find mechanisms 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:29.619
 direct to moisturize that area and not 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:33.399
 we need great efforts the 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:36.280
 glands that are in the areola is the 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:38.920
 dark area surrounding the nipple is 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.800
 increase in size during pregnancy 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.860
 they will form a secretion that is at 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.530
 Wetting and bactericidal ie time 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:51.460
 that the belief that we have to be 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.949
 washing the chest before and after 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.929
 breastfeed to avoid infections or 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.600
 complications in the baby is not real 

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:01.539
 while a mother is seen with greater 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:06.340
 often the chest more risk has of 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:08.200
 crack in this area that is so 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.740
 delicate that the skin are supremely 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.300
 fragile just because the baby is 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.790
 grip badly or just the fact of the 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.159
 friction from the baby's mouth can 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.190
 cause more drying can cause 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.790
 lacerations and damage 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:27.750
 this we use during the time of 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.680
 pregnancy the dairy gel to increase 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.680
 this zone 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.650
 the substances that make up this gel 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.670
 they are absolutely harmless are oils 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.130
 natural and are harmless to the baby 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.110
 you need to remove it from the chest before 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.630
 breastfeeding and you can use during the 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.950
 pregnancy time to moisturize this 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.950
 chest area 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:00.040
 I've heard about syringes that 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:02.950
 to facilitate the removal of the weight that is 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:06.670
 which says with respect to that the weight does not 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:09.580
 inverted if it could become 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.100
 in a limitation for an adequate grip 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.230
 and proper baby on the chest in 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:18.370
 some cases some people 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:22.900
 recommend the use of these syringes that 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:26.680
 cut the tip of the syringe the 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:30.880
 plunger is placed on the opposite side and 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:33.580
 with this a suction is made 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.120
 trying to make a version of the nipple 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:40.379
 or to remove the nipple 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:44.040
 these edges are sharp the suction 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:46.500
 what is done is limited to a very 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.830
 small and this can produce 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.980
 lacerations or cuts on the nipple 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:56.040
 that's why I do not recommend the use of these 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.810
 syringes in replacement of these 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:02.010
 syringes 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:05.520
 we have the person trainers already 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:08.310
 there is this design 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:12.600
 that helps us do the same suction 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.220
 the same version sucks us take us 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.440
 the nipple like they have an edge 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.540
 completely rounded are much more 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:23.490
 soft this will not produce cuts 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:25.670
 and thanks to this suction bulb we can 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.350
 make a more controlled version 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.780
 initially we make a little version 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.120
 softer as the breast goes 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.960
 holding on a little bit more we can do 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.720
 a stronger suction the use of this does not 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:42.540
 is to prepare the chest from the 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.230
 pregnancy the use of this is fit 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:49.770
 postnatal after the baby is born 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:52.170
 We use this to remove the nipple so 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.240
 we remove and the baby immediately comes 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.870
 to the chest when we use the syringes 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:00.350
 or we use these weight trainers in 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.630
 prenatal form we can unleash 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:06.360
 contractions before time and we can 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.540
 make mom have a birth 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.540
 premature 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.870
 an attachment used very frequently 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:19.320
 is the protector of person who is a 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:24.030
 silicone element that is put on 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:26.490
 the weight and areola and helps protect it 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.650
 for various reasons the nipple is usually 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.250
 crack or become very sensitive and 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.540
 cause pain during breastfeeding 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.970
 there are also occasions when the nipple 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.889
 is flat or inverted or the shape of the 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.590
 breast prevent the baby from thinking with 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:42.169
 ease if it were to happen can 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.700
 breastfeed without any impediment 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.950
 using a good nipple protector 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.870
 Not all nipple shields are 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.210
 automatically accepted by the baby 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.190
 one of the particularities that must 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.680
 look for a protector is your way and 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:58.320
 Thickness the baby should be able to think 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.020
 easily as you can observe the 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.330
 pinion is not conical offers a curvature 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.669
 enough for your little mouth to 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.890
 can press and is so thin that it 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:10.880
 fits like a glove protecting it 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.880
 while the baby sucks 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.380
 normally mothers who breastfeed 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:20.050
 they present a trickle of breast milk what 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.240
 that parents are very uncomfortable 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.790
 vision protectors will allow you 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.100
 feel comfortable and safe both inside 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:29.440
 like outside the home because they have a 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.600
 polymer and a special coating that 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.630
 absorbs milk and blocks it in the 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.460
 center of the father and jon offers you two 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.920
 peace alternatives according to their 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.080
 needs and preferences the pads 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.480
 Suden light are very thin and light 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.250
 with a good level of absorption and are 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.500
 ideal for mothers who have a 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:50.380
 medium flow or those that want 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.840
 a very discreet setting on the other hand the 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:55.450
 alternative soft fitch offers you a 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:59.310
 higher level of absorption and an adjustment still 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.310
 more comfortable because of its three-dimensional shape
