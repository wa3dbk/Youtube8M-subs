00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:03.689
 and 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.530
 Hello dear friends today you 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.510
 watch the video clip channel nat and we 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.000
 try to consider it pretty 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.910
 still popular theme about sounds about 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.630
 so why do not start the game bought 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.490
 the incentive for this is let's advance I 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:30.160
 I will open the steam as we were conducting 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:31.480
 on days in small operations and so began 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.660
 I want to tell you 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.500
 main reasons the first reason is 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.750
 the application may not support your 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.079
 computer components ie your com 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:50.289
 too weak to support 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:52.120
 application is the second reason it is not 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:54.579
 supports operating systems 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:01:01.059
 about take the game battlefield 3 or 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:03.339
 bf4 this they support windows 7 -8 but 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:10.030
 they are not like xp and not like windows me 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:12.520
 so the last reason that is solved 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.130
 very quickly and very simply this with 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.170
 the download of the game occurred all to the cache 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:21.150
 It is with her today that we will fight 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:24.540
 I will show the example of the game dota 2 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:29.740
 for this you need to go to the library 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:35.140
 look in the section all the games from the way 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:36.880
 We choose this game that is basically 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.840
 it can be shown and threatened but 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.220
 I run and so long after 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.730
 I did not upgrade much 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:48.760
 problem so let's fight it right 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.740
 keys click on the game field you have 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.100
 A list appears not we choose 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.120
 properties next we have a window in 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.720
 window 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:01.600
 above we choose the point there 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.630
 local files appear next 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:09.660
 a small list in it we choose 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.660
 the last is cache integrity check 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:18.530
 we have a download window it can 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.900
 take quite a lot of time so 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:27.410
 how it depends on the processor power and 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:31.430
 from the weight of the game the more the game hangs then 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:39.110
 there is a bigger size farther 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:43.489
 There will be a Steam file check, but not 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.840
 tighten this video I'm under i 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.870
 show pause 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:52.670
 and after a full check of files 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:54.590
 i will show you this dota ability and here 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:03:04.430
 dear friends I have to wait at all 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:06.410
 a bit colin percentage personally all the files 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.220
 have been successfully tested, you can also 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:12.459
 close now look at 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.459
 dota health 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:22.820
 here dear friends head starts 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.830
 also a good sign so says that 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.410
 need to say that it will start 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.760
 on this principle everything was with you office pro 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.020
