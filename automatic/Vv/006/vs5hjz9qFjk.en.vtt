00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
this thing is nuts it is a rocket bike

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.140 
this thing is nuts it is a rocket bike
and<00:00:03.780> the<00:00:03.840> fuel<00:00:04.080> is<00:00:04.319> asphalt<00:00:04.650> asphalt<00:00:05.609> asphalt

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
and the fuel is asphalt asphalt asphalt

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.059 
and the fuel is asphalt asphalt asphalt
like<00:00:06.660> you'd<00:00:07.410> make<00:00:07.440> your<00:00:07.649> street<00:00:07.859> out<00:00:08.010> of

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
like you'd make your street out of

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:44.409 
five four three two one ignition

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:48.859 
five four three two one ignition
all<00:00:45.190> right<00:00:45.489> got<00:00:45.760> fire<00:00:46.140> hit<00:00:47.140> the<00:00:47.289> button<00:00:47.620> I<00:00:47.829> did

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:48.869 
all right got fire hit the button I did

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:55.520 
all right got fire hit the button I did
nothing

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.709 

this<00:00:56.530> is<00:00:56.710> bad<00:00:56.979> this<00:00:57.309> is<00:00:57.579> uh<00:00:57.610> we<00:00:58.329> didn't<00:00:58.570> produce

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 
this is bad this is uh we didn't produce

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:02.279 
this is bad this is uh we didn't produce
real<00:00:59.320> thrust<00:00:59.680> from<00:01:00.159> the<00:01:00.969> rocket<00:01:01.359> engine<00:01:01.659> so

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:02.289 
real thrust from the rocket engine so

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:04.969 
real thrust from the rocket engine so
apparently<00:01:02.859> that<00:01:02.949> valve<00:01:03.280> sticky<00:01:04.000> around<00:01:04.629> to

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
apparently that valve sticky around to

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.030 
apparently that valve sticky around to
go<00:01:05.979> you<00:01:06.280> got<00:01:06.460> fired

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.890 

there<00:01:12.040> we<00:01:12.100> go<00:01:12.250> oh<00:01:14.400> man<00:01:15.450> clearly<00:01:16.450> we<00:01:16.720> have<00:01:16.869> a

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
there we go oh man clearly we have a

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.540 
there we go oh man clearly we have a
technical<00:01:17.440> difficulty<00:01:17.890> I<00:01:18.130> think<00:01:18.280> we<00:01:18.369> gotta

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
technical difficulty I think we gotta

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.750 
technical difficulty I think we gotta
just<00:01:18.880> not<00:01:19.060> yeah<00:01:19.570> as<00:01:19.690> a<00:01:19.720> sticky<00:01:20.170> baton<00:01:21.130> it's<00:01:21.580> not

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
just not yeah as a sticky baton it's not

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.520 
just not yeah as a sticky baton it's not
all<00:01:21.940> rocket<00:01:22.360> science<00:01:22.690> our<00:01:22.810> quality<00:01:23.140> control

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
all rocket science our quality control

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.570 
all rocket science our quality control
is<00:01:23.680> suffering<00:01:24.070> here<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:26.860> Tim's<00:01:27.130> ignition

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
is suffering here so Tim's ignition

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.940 
is suffering here so Tim's ignition
system<00:01:27.970> isn't<00:01:28.119> working<00:01:28.330> but<00:01:29.050> he<00:01:29.259> has<00:01:29.740> a<00:01:29.770> new

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
system isn't working but he has a new

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.620 
system isn't working but he has a new
idea<00:01:30.280> so<00:01:30.520> what<00:01:30.790> I<00:01:30.820> don't<00:01:31.060> want<00:01:31.180> to<00:01:31.240> do<00:01:31.330> is<00:01:31.420> take

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
gonna tape this to one of these igniters

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:43.770 
gonna tape this to one of these igniters
we<00:01:41.020> made<00:01:41.259> this<00:01:41.800> is<00:01:41.979> cannon<00:01:42.700> fuse<00:01:42.940> did<00:01:43.450> he<00:01:43.600> just
