00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:29.759
 have supplied for that it was 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.210
 touchpad controller a device with 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:35.360

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.329
 functions in a simple and intuitive way 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.370
 especially in the use of viera connect 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.379
 but a warning before you can use 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.500
 the way the touch pad controller is 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.470
 need to create communication between 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.199
 the touchpad and the TV is sufficient 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.780
 access the settings menu and 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.790
 appropriate item for the touchpad 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.129
 controller we can create 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.290
 the coupling between the TV and the 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.390
 device so you can 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.780
 use for all functions now 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.700

 the keys are present in this remote control 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.229
 per channel and volume change while 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.149
 other keys are used for 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.720
 make it easy and intuitive to use 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:20.280
 smart functions for example 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.650
 by pressing the button with three segments 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.690
 horizontal that corresponds to the key vi 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.780
 it was traditional remote control tools 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.580
 we can access viera connect 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.130
 move your finger on the touchpad and with a 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.159

 however present two buttons 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.720
 corresponding to the left and keys 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.330
 right of a computer's touchpad 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.520
 if we select the web browser as it is 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:48.060
 can see move between the favorites and the 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.350
 various functions is simple and fast 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.689
 while with a circular motion it is 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.360
 You can scroll the page to do it 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:56.560
 scroll up and down 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.530
 now instead of closing the application 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:03.159
 with the hicks key we reduce it to an icon 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:07.080
 we re-enter with the central round button 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.080
 in via connect we have youtube 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:14.110
 the application was completely 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.450
 redesigned to make it easy to use 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.110
 also with everyone's classic remote control 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:23.350
 the smart TV viera we reduce of konan that 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.090
 youtube and let's see how with a key is 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.950
 You can quickly recall the 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.950
