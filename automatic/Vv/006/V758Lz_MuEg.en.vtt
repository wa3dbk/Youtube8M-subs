00:00:00.368 --> 00:00:06.042
 "Brandon had to solve problems from 45 to 75 for homework. 

00:00:06.042 --> 00:00:11.921
 If Brandon has solved all the tasks assigned to him, how much has he solved the problem? " 

00:00:11.921 --> 00:00:16.460
 Here we come to the temptation to simply subtract 45 of 75. 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.305
 Well you could say that 75 minus 45 equals 30. 

00:00:20.305 --> 00:00:23.125
 He might have solved exactly 30 tasks. 

00:00:23.125 --> 00:00:25.916
 But we have to be very, very careful. 

00:00:25.916 --> 00:00:29.436
 And to understand why we have to be careful - I'll put a questionnaire here. 

00:00:29.436 --> 00:00:32.785
 To understand why we have to be careful, imagine - 

00:00:32.785 --> 00:00:36.244
 Let's go try a few numbers to figure things out. 

00:00:36.247 --> 00:00:47.206
 Let's say, instead of 45 to 75, let's assume he had to solve problems from 3 to 6. 

00:00:47.206 --> 00:00:49.696
 If we use the technique we mentioned just before, 

00:00:49.696 --> 00:00:52.633
 they would say that 6 minus 3 equals 3. 

00:00:52.633 --> 00:00:54.728
 Maybe he had to solve 3 problems 

00:00:54.728 --> 00:00:56.100
 Count them. 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.745
 There is a problem 1, problem 2, problem 3, problem 4, problem 5, problem 6. 

00:01:00.745 --> 00:01:06.512
 They will have to solve problems from third to sixth, including problem 3. 

00:01:06.512 --> 00:01:10.901
 So, solve problem 3, problem 4, problem 5, problem 6. 

00:01:10.901 --> 00:01:15.747
 When I deduct 6 of 3, I actually only count problems 4, 5 and 6. 

00:01:15.747 --> 00:01:19.580
 I look at how much I have to go from 3 to 6. 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.972
 Not including the third problem. 

00:01:21.972 --> 00:01:24.795
 So, while solving problems from the third to the sixth, 

00:01:24.795 --> 00:01:30.780
 does not solve 6 minus 3, but 6 minus 3 plus 1. 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.841
 It actually solves 4 problems. 

00:01:34.841 --> 00:01:42.011
 We can check in multiple scenarios that when we subtract, we do not consider the initial problem. 

00:01:42.011 --> 00:01:44.909
 We only count the singles after him. 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.826
 To answer this question, if he solves problems from 45 to 75, 

00:01:48.826 --> 00:01:50.529
 it's not enough just to take it away. 

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:53.388
 It will not account for the first problem, problem 45. 

00:01:53.388 --> 00:01:56.014
 We need to add one. 

00:01:56.014 --> 00:02:01.968
 In this case, Brandon solved 31 problems. 

00:02:01.968 --> 00:02:04.517
 Let's solve another problem. 

00:02:04.517 --> 00:02:11.685
 "The baker has the whole bread. How many cuts he has to make to get the same 7 pieces?" 

00:02:11.685 --> 00:02:16.339
 You can solve this directly by trying to cut the spit. 

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:19.931
 But let's think if we have 70 equal parts, a lot more. 

00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:23.996
 We can draw a little bread. 

00:02:23.996 --> 00:02:25.660
 That's our bread. 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.727
 If we want 2 pieces, how many times do we have to cut off? 

00:02:30.727 --> 00:02:32.661
 We'll cut it off once. 

00:02:32.661 --> 00:02:35.455
 2 slides, make only 1 cut. 

00:02:35.455 --> 00:02:37.796
 What if we want to sell 3? 

00:02:37.796 --> 00:02:41.992
 If we want 3 dice, how many cuts will we make? 

00:02:41.992 --> 00:02:45.110
 Let's lurk once, and we'll grab another time. 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.931
 We prank twice, and I think you see the pattern. 

00:02:48.931 --> 00:02:54.272
 If we want 4 dice, how many cuts do we make? 

00:02:54.272 --> 00:03:00.239
 Well, 1, 2, 3 cut, so there will be 3 cuts. 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.585
 We can go up to 7, but you can see the pattern. 

00:03:02.585 --> 00:03:09.050
 As much as we want, we have to make as many cuts as minus one. 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:15.115
 For 7 spades, we need 6 cuts, and we see why. 

00:03:15.115 --> 00:03:21.446
 We do not have to cut that last part. He remains on the verge. 

00:03:21.446 --> 00:03:25.769
 Let's solve another one. 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.563
 "He built a flat fence with 1 meter wide spacers. 

00:03:30.563 --> 00:03:34.683
 If the fence is 18 meters long, how many columns do he need? " 

00:03:34.683 --> 00:03:36.921
 We use the same idea. 

00:03:36.921 --> 00:03:38.847
 Let's deal with a smaller situation. 

00:03:38.847 --> 00:03:42.969
 Imagine a 2 meter fence. 

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:49.126
 For a 2 meter fence, he will need 1 column. Then one meter fence goes. 

00:03:49.126 --> 00:03:51.755
 Then he needs another column. 

00:03:51.755 --> 00:03:55.155
 Then he goes one meter fence, and then he needs another column. 

00:03:55.155 --> 00:04:00.421
 If we compare this with bread cutting, we have a cut, but we must also have the ends. 

00:04:00.421 --> 00:04:04.915
 For 2 meters of fences, they need 3 pillars. 

00:04:04.915 --> 00:04:09.244
 And for 3 meters fence? 

00:04:09.244 --> 00:04:16.420
 We'll need the first pillar, the meter of the fence. Then the second pillar, and the meter fence. 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.876
 We also have the third pillar, but we're not done yet. 

00:04:18.876 --> 00:04:22.867
 We have another meter of fencing. And we need a final column here. 

00:04:22.867 --> 00:04:26.373
 You see we need 4 pillars. 

00:04:26.373 --> 00:04:31.800
 We need a pillar at the beginning of each part, and one pillar to the end. 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.550
 What we see is that as many meters as the long fence we need so many pillars plus one. 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.766
 Here, if we have 18 meters, we will need 19 fence posts.
