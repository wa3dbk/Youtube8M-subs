00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
the package of hair that I'm using you

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:25.929 
the package of hair that I'm using you
can<00:00:24.650> see<00:00:24.800> which<00:00:24.890> is<00:00:25.040> a<00:00:25.070> Brazilian<00:00:25.279> natural

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
can see which is a Brazilian natural

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:27.910 
can see which is a Brazilian natural
wave<00:00:26.119> is<00:00:26.480> a<00:00:26.510> cheap<00:00:26.750> quality<00:00:26.960> hair<00:00:27.440> that<00:00:27.710> comes

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 
wave is a cheap quality hair that comes

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.859 
wave is a cheap quality hair that comes
already<00:00:28.160> pre<00:00:28.520> colored<00:00:28.910> so<00:00:29.449> it<00:00:29.570> makes<00:00:29.750> it

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
already pre colored so it makes it

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.229 
already pre colored so it makes it
easier<00:00:30.170> for<00:00:30.230> you<00:00:30.609> now<00:00:31.609> I<00:00:31.640> think<00:00:31.760> it's<00:00:32.090> like

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
easier for you now I think it's like

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.229 
easier for you now I think it's like
1999<00:00:33.019> everyone<00:00:33.610> so<00:00:34.610> the<00:00:34.730> first<00:00:34.940> thing<00:00:35.059> that<00:00:35.090> I

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
1999 everyone so the first thing that I

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:36.729 
1999 everyone so the first thing that I
noticed<00:00:35.600> right<00:00:35.750> out<00:00:35.900> the<00:00:36.019> package<00:00:36.379> is<00:00:36.590> that

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
noticed right out the package is that

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:38.259 
noticed right out the package is that
this<00:00:36.860> hair<00:00:37.129> is<00:00:37.220> really<00:00:37.400> thin<00:00:37.730> it's<00:00:38.000> kind<00:00:38.210> of

00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:38.269 
this hair is really thin it's kind of

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:40.360 
this hair is really thin it's kind of
similar<00:00:38.540> to<00:00:38.690> like<00:00:38.960> Barbie<00:00:39.379> hair<00:00:39.559> too<00:00:39.769> bad<00:00:40.040> but

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
similar to like Barbie hair too bad but

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.639 
similar to like Barbie hair too bad but
I<00:00:40.790> figured<00:00:41.480> I<00:00:41.600> would<00:00:41.629> glue<00:00:42.019> a<00:00:42.050> few<00:00:42.440> left

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
I figured I would glue a few left

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:44.410 
I figured I would glue a few left
together<00:00:43.160> to<00:00:43.430> create<00:00:43.640> a<00:00:43.790> more<00:00:43.910> thicker

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
together to create a more thicker

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:51.540 
together to create a more thicker
looking<00:00:44.660> hair<00:00:44.870> so<00:00:45.320> that<00:00:45.469> it<00:00:45.590> matches<00:00:45.739> my<00:00:46.160> own

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.830 

now<00:00:52.550> you<00:00:52.579> should<00:00:52.850> probably<00:00:53.059> wait<00:00:53.450> until<00:00:53.600> the

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
now you should probably wait until the

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.569 
now you should probably wait until the
glue<00:00:54.020> gets<00:00:54.200> a<00:00:54.350> little<00:00:54.500> tacky<00:00:55.039> so<00:00:55.250> that<00:00:55.399> this

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
glue gets a little tacky so that this

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.750 
glue gets a little tacky so that this
part<00:00:55.879> is<00:00:55.969> easier<00:00:56.539> I<00:00:56.899> went<00:00:57.739> right<00:00:58.010> ahead<00:00:58.160> and<00:00:58.610> I

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
part is easier I went right ahead and I

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.389 
part is easier I went right ahead and I
flipped<00:00:59.180> over<00:00:59.360> the<00:01:00.289> hair<00:01:00.530> and<00:01:00.800> I'm<00:01:00.950> trying<00:01:01.250> to

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
flipped over the hair and I'm trying to

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:02.799 
flipped over the hair and I'm trying to
press<00:01:01.610> them<00:01:01.789> together<00:01:01.969> but<00:01:02.390> it's<00:01:02.539> kind<00:01:02.750> of

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
press them together but it's kind of

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.200 
press them together but it's kind of
hard<00:01:02.989> because<00:01:03.230> it's<00:01:03.770> not<00:01:03.860> touching<00:01:04.399> yet<00:01:04.580> so

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
hard because it's not touching yet so

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:19.429 
hard because it's not touching yet so
definitely<00:01:06.170> wait<00:01:06.350> a<00:01:06.380> little<00:01:06.619> bit

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.569 

okay<00:01:20.439> so<00:01:20.500> now<00:01:20.770> that<00:01:20.799> you<00:01:20.979> feel<00:01:21.189> like<00:01:21.310> you<00:01:21.429> got

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:21.579 
okay so now that you feel like you got

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:23.520 
okay so now that you feel like you got
them<00:01:21.729> attached<00:01:22.090> I'd<00:01:22.329> like<00:01:22.630> to<00:01:22.840> go<00:01:23.020> ahead<00:01:23.140> and

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
them attached I'd like to go ahead and

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.480 
them attached I'd like to go ahead and
go<00:01:23.649> and<00:01:24.159> apply<00:01:25.119> more<00:01:25.479> pressure<00:01:25.920> by<00:01:26.920> walking<00:01:27.340> my

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
go and apply more pressure by walking my

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:34.330 
go and apply more pressure by walking my
fingers<00:01:27.850> across<00:01:28.030> the<00:01:28.420> web

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.890 

so<00:01:35.340> this<00:01:35.520> is<00:01:35.640> what<00:01:35.790> three<00:01:36.060> web<00:01:36.330> glued<00:01:36.720> together

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
so this is what three web glued together

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.390 
so this is what three web glued together
it<00:01:37.290> looks<00:01:37.470> like<00:01:39.950> so<00:01:40.950> right<00:01:41.130> here<00:01:41.280> I'm<00:01:41.369> just

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
it looks like so right here I'm just

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.520 
it looks like so right here I'm just
starting<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.970> repeat<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.420> process<00:01:42.630> by<00:01:42.930> gluing

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
starting to repeat the process by gluing

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.499 
starting to repeat the process by gluing
a<00:01:43.650> few<00:01:43.920> whacks<00:01:44.100> together<00:01:44.610> this<00:01:45.119> will<00:01:45.270> be<00:01:45.360> my

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
a few whacks together this will be my

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.630 
a few whacks together this will be my
bottom

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.400 

oh<00:01:48.670> yeah<00:01:49.330> and<00:01:49.420> I<00:01:49.450> forgot<00:01:49.690> to<00:01:49.750> mention<00:01:49.960> the<00:01:50.260> glue

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.280 

you

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.780 

just<00:02:08.290> be<00:02:08.410> patient<00:02:08.619> and<00:02:09.040> do<00:02:09.220> this<00:02:09.369> in<00:02:09.520> a<00:02:09.550> place

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:09.790 
just be patient and do this in a place

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:11.430 
just be patient and do this in a place

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
that's easy cleanup for you because it

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
that's easy cleanup for you because it
can<00:02:11.650> get<00:02:11.800> a<00:02:11.860> little<00:02:12.130> messy

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.650 

so<00:02:18.460> the<00:02:18.550> last<00:02:18.730> time<00:02:18.940> that<00:02:18.970> I<00:02:19.090> did<00:02:19.180> is<00:02:19.480> I<00:02:19.630> did

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
so the last time that I did is I did

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.360 
so the last time that I did is I did
this<00:02:19.930> one<00:02:20.110> crazy<00:02:20.380> cool<00:02:20.680> and<00:02:20.800> it<00:02:20.890> worked<00:02:21.040> fine

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
this one crazy cool and it worked fine

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.670 
this one crazy cool and it worked fine
but<00:02:21.730> since<00:02:22.420> a<00:02:22.570> beauty<00:02:22.810> supply<00:02:22.960> can<00:02:23.260> have<00:02:23.440> crazy

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
but since a beauty supply can have crazy

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.060 
but since a beauty supply can have crazy
goo<00:02:23.980> I<00:02:24.160> just<00:02:24.700> settle<00:02:25.120> for<00:02:25.150> Naoki<00:02:25.780> and<00:02:26.410> then<00:02:26.920> a

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
goo I just settle for Naoki and then a

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.460 
goo I just settle for Naoki and then a
little<00:02:27.220> bit<00:02:27.430> in<00:02:27.490> quite<00:02:28.000> work<00:02:28.300> as<00:02:28.510> well<00:02:28.960> as<00:02:29.200> the

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
little bit in quite work as well as the

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.430 
little bit in quite work as well as the
craziness<00:02:29.970> so<00:02:30.970> I<00:02:31.000> ended<00:02:31.510> up<00:02:31.630> trying<00:02:32.110> a

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
craziness so I ended up trying a

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.800 
craziness so I ended up trying a
different<00:02:32.470> technique<00:02:32.940> and<00:02:33.940> what<00:02:34.150> I<00:02:34.180> did<00:02:34.450> was<00:02:34.660> I

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
different technique and what I did was I

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.870 
different technique and what I did was I
applied<00:02:35.110> a<00:02:35.140> thin<00:02:35.260> layer<00:02:35.680> of<00:02:35.740> hair<00:02:36.340> groom<00:02:36.580> first

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
applied a thin layer of hair groom first

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.150 
applied a thin layer of hair groom first
then<00:02:37.600> I<00:02:37.630> apply<00:02:38.020> the<00:02:38.050> nail<00:02:38.380> glue<00:02:38.680> and<00:02:38.920> then<00:02:39.100> I

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
then I apply the nail glue and then I

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.030 
then I apply the nail glue and then I
apply<00:02:39.520> the<00:02:39.550> clip<00:02:40.000> onto<00:02:40.300> the<00:02:40.600> web<00:02:40.840> if<00:02:41.710> that

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
apply the clip onto the web if that

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.010 
apply the clip onto the web if that
makes<00:02:42.250> sense<00:02:42.490> and<00:02:42.730> then<00:02:42.790> I<00:02:43.390> just<00:02:43.660> squeeze

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
makes sense and then I just squeeze

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.770 
makes sense and then I just squeeze
squeeze<00:02:44.410> squeeze<00:02:44.590> and<00:02:45.340> you<00:02:45.670> know<00:02:45.730> mess<00:02:46.600> around

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
squeeze squeeze and you know mess around

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.600 
squeeze squeeze and you know mess around
with<00:02:47.080> it<00:02:47.320> and<00:02:47.530> you<00:02:47.590> can<00:02:47.740> even<00:02:47.860> pull<00:02:48.220> this<00:02:48.400> to

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
with it and you can even pull this to

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.070 
with it and you can even pull this to
make<00:02:48.820> sure<00:02:48.850> it's<00:02:49.150> nice<00:02:49.330> and<00:02:49.360> secure

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
make sure it's nice and secure

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.840 
make sure it's nice and secure
and<00:02:50.620> you<00:02:50.710> definitely<00:02:50.950> don't<00:02:51.310> want<00:02:51.520> this<00:02:51.640> to

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
and you definitely don't want this to

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.140 
and you definitely don't want this to
fall<00:02:52.120> off<00:02:52.390> while<00:02:52.750> you're<00:02:52.930> wearing<00:02:53.170> I<00:02:54.150> think

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
fall off while you're wearing I think

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.590 
fall off while you're wearing I think
it's<00:02:55.300> pretty<00:02:55.450> good<00:02:56.280> so<00:02:57.280> once<00:02:57.670> again<00:02:57.880> I've<00:02:58.270> been

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
it's pretty good so once again I've been

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.530 
it's pretty good so once again I've been
their<00:02:58.840> hair<00:02:59.200> glue<00:02:59.440> then<00:03:00.280> a<00:03:00.310> thin<00:03:00.790> layer<00:03:01.000> of<00:03:01.360> the

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
their hair glue then a thin layer of the

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:09.920 
their hair glue then a thin layer of the
nail<00:03:01.750> glue<00:03:02.050> and<00:03:02.380> then<00:03:03.340> apply<00:03:03.700> your<00:03:03.910> clip

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.930 

you

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.210 

so<00:03:15.840> once<00:03:16.050> clued<00:03:16.320> on<00:03:16.500> I<00:03:16.530> would<00:03:16.800> definitely

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
so once clued on I would definitely

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.860 
so once clued on I would definitely
start<00:03:17.400> opening<00:03:17.880> and<00:03:18.000> closing<00:03:18.360> the<00:03:18.450> clip<00:03:18.690> just

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
start opening and closing the clip just

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:19.580 
start opening and closing the clip just
to<00:03:18.990> make<00:03:19.170> sure

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
to make sure

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.550 
to make sure
flexible<00:03:20.220> enough<00:03:20.490> for<00:03:20.550> you<00:03:20.880> and<00:03:21.230> also<00:03:22.230> another

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
flexible enough for you and also another

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.770 
flexible enough for you and also another
thing<00:03:22.710> that<00:03:23.010> I<00:03:23.070> noticed<00:03:23.100> was<00:03:23.850> that<00:03:23.880> applying

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
thing that I noticed was that applying

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.570 
thing that I noticed was that applying
this<00:03:24.990> glue<00:03:25.320> it<00:03:25.650> make<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:26.790> web<00:03:27.000> more<00:03:27.960> stiff<00:03:28.890> as

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
this glue it make the web more stiff as

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.460 
this glue it make the web more stiff as
you<00:03:29.730> can<00:03:29.910> see<00:03:30.150> it's<00:03:30.300> already<00:03:30.480> thick<00:03:30.930> but<00:03:31.290> I

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
you can see it's already thick but I

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.830 
you can see it's already thick but I
moved<00:03:31.770> three<00:03:32.070> of<00:03:32.160> them<00:03:32.280> together<00:03:32.490> and<00:03:33.000> don't

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
moved three of them together and don't

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.330 
moved three of them together and don't
apply<00:03:34.110> too<00:03:34.170> much<00:03:34.350> of<00:03:34.620> that<00:03:34.740> glue<00:03:34.980> because<00:03:35.310> it

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
apply too much of that glue because it

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.440 
apply too much of that glue because it
will<00:03:35.490> feel<00:03:36.180> very<00:03:36.210> very<00:03:36.840> stiff<00:03:38.300> what<00:03:39.300> the

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
will feel very very stiff what the

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.950 
will feel very very stiff what the
stiffness<00:03:39.840> really<00:03:40.230> doesn't<00:03:40.560> even<00:03:40.650> bother<00:03:40.860> me

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:44.960 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.120 

okay<00:03:45.960> so<00:03:46.020> here<00:03:46.350> I'm<00:03:46.440> just<00:03:46.650> repeating<00:03:46.950> the

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
okay so here I'm just repeating the

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.370 
okay so here I'm just repeating the
process<00:03:47.400> and<00:03:47.850> applying<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.330> last<00:03:48.510> clip<00:03:48.870> to<00:03:49.110> my

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
process and applying the last clip to my

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.710 
process and applying the last clip to my
last<00:03:49.620> one<00:03:49.980> as<00:03:50.280> you<00:03:50.760> can<00:03:50.910> see<00:03:51.090> guys<00:03:51.240> this<00:03:51.570> was

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
last one as you can see guys this was

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.660 
last one as you can see guys this was
very<00:03:51.930> easy<00:03:52.200> to<00:03:52.500> do<00:03:52.680> I<00:03:52.950> hope<00:03:53.220> that<00:03:53.400> you<00:03:53.460> found

the clips already attached now for a
quick<00:04:11.280> walkthrough<00:04:11.520> on<00:04:11.760> how<00:04:11.880> I<00:04:12.090> apply<00:04:12.450> them<00:04:12.660> to

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
quick walkthrough on how I apply them to

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.600 
quick walkthrough on how I apply them to
my<00:04:12.810> hair<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.410> first<00:04:13.650> thing<00:04:13.800> I<00:04:13.890> do<00:04:13.950> is<00:04:14.190> I<00:04:14.310> part

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
really care no one's going to see it I

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.930 
really care no one's going to see it I
just<00:04:19.560> measure<00:04:19.830> it<00:04:19.950> out<00:04:20.220> and<00:04:20.489> I<00:04:20.580> apply<00:04:20.880> the

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
just measure it out and I apply the

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.690 
just measure it out and I apply the
subject<00:04:21.420> clip<00:04:21.570> first<00:04:21.870> I<00:04:22.230> tease<00:04:23.010> with<00:04:23.370> it<00:04:23.520> with

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
subject clip first I tease with it with

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.030 
subject clip first I tease with it with
itself<00:04:24.120> and<00:04:24.390> then<00:04:24.570> I<00:04:24.660> just<00:04:24.870> put

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
itself and then I just put

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:32.300 
itself and then I just put
I<00:04:30.350> just<00:04:31.350> make<00:04:31.530> sure<00:04:31.560> they're<00:04:31.830> secure<00:04:31.980> by

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
I just make sure they're secure by

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:50.969 
I just make sure they're secure by
moving<00:04:32.640> that<00:04:32.820> with<00:04:32.970> a<00:04:33.000> little<00:04:33.180> bit<00:04:33.390> of<00:04:33.450> force

cutting them gives it a more real like
feel<00:05:25.659> cause<00:05:26.080> it<00:05:26.199> adds<00:05:26.319> like<00:05:26.530> big<00:05:26.860> split<00:05:27.280> ends<00:05:27.610> I

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.570 
so another part of my blending is
curling<00:05:52.720> my<00:05:52.870> natural<00:05:53.260> hair<00:05:53.440> give<00:05:54.130> it<00:05:54.280> a<00:05:54.370> few

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
ways so that imagine the wave pattern of

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:10.730 
ways so that imagine the wave pattern of
the<00:05:57.130> attention<00:05:58.770> to<00:05:59.770> you
