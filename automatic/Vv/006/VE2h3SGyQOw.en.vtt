 very good players and serious and 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.160
 welcome to your new video by 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.830
 channel and use in another top 5 the best 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:33.269
 in brno freemium in mini games in the 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:37.000
 that would be from minecraft from 11.7 up to the 

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:38.260
 1,800 I'm depending, I do not think 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.150
 all the service will be updating 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.910
 until it reaches 1.9 but ward 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:47.750
 well I said that every 10 I was going to 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:50.300
 access one of these videos so be it 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.220
 gameplay or something I will be uploading is a 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.640
 Minecraft gameplay has 10 line 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:58.400
 I'll upload another one, well, this one before a 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.040
 video had about 600 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.840
 600 and some almost 700 visits 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.000
 visits until good and still not 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.800
 one month of the video and has also 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.480
 had two of likes and good as happened 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.070
 the days the victim of another video is my 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.930
 obligation and how I am going to fulfill my 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.550
 word in the channel I'm going to have to 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.740
 do then we are in the 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.470
 fifth since it would be the server of 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.510
 warcraft network one of the most server 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.110
 complete in what would be clear minigame 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:26.120
 that does not have mindflex minigames but 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:29.580
 it has games and at the end in 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:32.280
 own and good 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.140
 the problem in the server or defect does not 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.610
 has society is something there is no that 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.930
 stay in the problem 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.570
 skywork 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.600
 It has very few arenas and they are not 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.550
 own the problem of skywork if 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.930
 do you want to come 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.289
 I do not recommend that you enter the sky work 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.909
 the world is in 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:54.009
 maintenance and the others are open 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.259
 then it 's guys and a program 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.880
 special about this server we go to the 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:01.340
 fourth place 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.829
 and good yesterday we are already in what 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.869
 which would be the fourth position and we 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:09.960
 we found as we can see in the 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:14.400
 screen in the mini space server 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:16.950
 I do not know how this one serves me anymore 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.770
 I knew some time ago but the 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:23.310
 problem is that it was too long already 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.770
 I could not even walk because I was already going and 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.150
 sweeps the guide or did he walked in 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.680
 a much more computer in which 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.460
 I am here and now I'm not I have 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.260
 almost the good because I put this server 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.890
 in fourth place is because they have improved 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.750
 the lake is given there are servers that do not 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.910
 worries a lot already and leave there what 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.400
 that they care about the problem but they have not 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.540
 decided to improve have implemented new 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.510
 games 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:53.440
 we have survival escape from the beast 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:56.860
 we have sources and pvp in what would be 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.990
 skywork and sky world 2.0 eye on these 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.840
 caigo has its own sands and in the 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:05.530
 here are sands recovered just in case 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:08.200
 faction has hunger games this 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.840
 this is what is seen in maintenance 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.239
 for her she will start to take out everything 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.190
 game that are many mini-games and 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.860
 we have reading the win or is it a 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.989
 server that has been set and you can already 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.150
 say the stacks for more people to come 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:26.470
 and do not stay behind like many duties 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:28.570
 small and good but the bad thing either 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.410
 they do too expands macro server that 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:34.540
 it's the bad thing about b1 the same I do not know if 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.940
 someone gets into Serbian to do an ex 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.680
 payment on everything in every being for example 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.640
 I was on a server called limbo kraft 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.000
 It's the green 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.709
 famous and good and this time the mister put 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.620
 like 30 messages saying that they get 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.720
 that gave rank and I said egg a range 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.690
 but what rank will they give and when would I get 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.550
 I'm not too I went out and new 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.890
 tongue the chs well I put in the 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.440
 brain through space and because sometimes 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.030
 I have Alvaro some hacker for nothing more 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.910
 boy then let's comment your post 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.670
 and good player, we are in the 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.620
 first three place is excellent on 0 and 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:13.250
 we are in the server of the 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.959
 will invoke good let's start this 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.840
 is one of the best serve in the 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.280
 which I had the best experience playing 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.550
 multiplayer of minecraft in this 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:25.909
 server and good the one that has that 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:29.729
 server has what it is 

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:32.400
 skywork towers team sky work for the 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:35.009
 moment it maintains two arenas and they go to 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.139
 implement more that yes sure they should 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:40.219
 implement more escape from the beast and 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:44.729
 capture it I'm not faction survival 

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:48.120
 skyblues and then decide for 1.8 not 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:51.940
 It serves for 1.7 well this server 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:55.060
 let's say mother the good the bad 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:58.890
 have a slight problem with that and 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:01.900
 I also do not know what the term is like but 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:04.300
 security sand something like that and they destroy themselves 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:08.260
 some which are always studied the 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.810
 pokemon because this is the kraft no 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.690
 cousin 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:15.090
 it has enough sand you could say 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.760
 has all the four-foot flours 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.770
 as good guys is a program that 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.240
 still need to see and we go for the 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.000
 next server we go for the two 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.370
 last for the two triples and good 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.650
 player we are already in the second 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.750
 placed in the first two positions of 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.980
 the two best servers and we are in the 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:37.919
 server of the author landia networks good 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:42.060
 the famous because for without games of 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:44.010
 hungry 'nine games and why because the 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.540
 Most people who play are 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.700
 in the game mode we have 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:51.090
 problems with what is fps sluggish 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:54.060
 because we do not have a grandmother but good 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:57.150
 here you will not have so many fps slumps 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:06:01.950
 as long as they give you say you're in 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:03.880
 53 down 10 or you're down 37 down 1 to 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:06.820
 3 not here 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.560
 you get off at times it's going to be regular it's not 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:11.530
 that's going to be like that 1 downs to the beast 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.390
 it's not going to be normal in the problems is 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:16.090
 who has been delaying a lot in 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:18.370
 open what are the mini-games and have 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:20.650
 a problem either needing good 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.300
 too much and what 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.160
 that they say they 're going to implement in a 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:27.070
 day and not yet not just that for 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:29.919
 I am the problem that is minimal and 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:31.810
 good the good that that of the games of the 

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:33.520
 hunger and other things more you 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.080
 they can verify it they enter the 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.630
 zero of the ip or do the exception like this 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:40.090
 like previous ones and the one that stays 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:43.500
 guys, we're going to the first place and the last 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:46.350
 and after cold video 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:49.260
 well I found ourselves in the first 

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:51.810
 position and last of this video and it's already 

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:54.240
 will end and we are in the software 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:07:00.540
 of magic good this is like a kind 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:07:02.220
 of the sera the server of his crack I think 

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:04.770
 that are the same owners because they have 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:06.510
 absolutely everything the same and good for that 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.860
 teams put first the 

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:10.110
 principle because until now we have 

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:12.300
 found with a hacker fox have 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:14.070
 been implementing new arena has 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:17.130
 been updating the games and everything 

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:19.230
 this very little but surely they will be 

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:21.630
 they arrange adding more because it's a 

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:24.590
 server that can be much more than what 

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:27.120
 they are now but no player I say goodbye 

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:28.230
 crying nothing more to say if you 

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.510
 they want that part of the day I'm 

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:32.250
 really grateful 

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:34.470
 I want you to give me your opinion on what 

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:38.280
 it seems to me that I am a farn of tn and 

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:40.860
 good if there is any opinion on the 

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:43.260
 video or something I want you to do 

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:45.240
 tutorial that I can do as per 

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.950
 example designs for the channel leaving what 

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:50.360
 I said saying you started a 

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:50.360
 next video clip chao
