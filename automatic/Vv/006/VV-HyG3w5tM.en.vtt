00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
first period we I thought we came out

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.259 
first period we I thought we came out
well<00:04:09.860> and<00:04:10.040> you<00:04:10.790> know<00:04:10.880> it<00:04:10.940> took<00:04:11.030> us<00:04:11.180> probably

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
well and you know it took us probably

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:13.539 
well and you know it took us probably
ten<00:04:11.540> minutes<00:04:11.840> to<00:04:11.989> match<00:04:12.410> him<00:04:12.650> and<00:04:12.769> he<00:04:13.370> said

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
ten minutes to match him and he said

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:14.949 
ten minutes to match him and he said
that<00:04:13.580> that's<00:04:13.849> a<00:04:13.940> very<00:04:14.150> good<00:04:14.209> hockey<00:04:14.599> club<00:04:14.810> and

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
why we practice shootouts in during the

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.850 
why we practice shootouts in during the
week<00:05:17.150> is<00:05:17.419> you<00:05:17.720> can<00:05:17.990> throw<00:05:18.169> the<00:05:18.289> fattest<00:05:18.650> and

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
the limp rights in there and I thought

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.779 
the limp rights in there and I thought
you<00:05:21.440> know<00:05:21.470> they<00:05:21.650> obviously<00:05:21.770> leggies<00:05:22.400> kind<00:05:22.729> of

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:22.789 
you know they obviously leggies kind of

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:24.129 
you know they obviously leggies kind of
the<00:05:22.849> stalemate<00:05:23.060> easy<00:05:23.479> is<00:05:23.690> usually<00:05:23.990> pretty

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:24.139 
the stalemate easy is usually pretty

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:27.400 
the stalemate easy is usually pretty
good<00:05:24.289> on<00:05:24.530> him<00:05:24.680> so<00:05:24.830> but<00:05:25.669> and<00:05:25.910> the<00:05:26.300> day<00:05:26.419> was<00:05:26.660> a<00:05:26.720> it

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
good on him so but and the day was a it

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:28.990 
good on him so but and the day was a it
was<00:05:27.470> a<00:05:27.590> hard-fought<00:05:27.889> victory<00:05:28.280> pressure<00:05:28.849> on

was a hard-fought victory pressure on

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.370 
was a hard-fought victory pressure on
the<00:05:29.150> approach<00:05:29.360> wasn't<00:05:29.599> that<00:05:29.810> because<00:05:29.990> if<00:05:30.260> you

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 
the approach wasn't that because if you

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.650 
the approach wasn't that because if you
miss<00:05:30.530> it's<00:05:31.310> game<00:05:31.550> over<00:05:31.729> any<00:05:32.030> finished<00:05:32.389> really
