00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.520
 he had left at 8am in the morning from Boulogne 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.750
 well over 100 kilometers traveled 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.580
 and then the teams left the 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.530
 coastline and find the night by returning 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.570
 in the land sometimes the way seems 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.700
 but it is risky to avoid strips 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.500
 roads borrowed too much as day one 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:21.170
 relays the leaders and 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:30.449
 horses every 15 km sculpin then read 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:31.830
 congratulates a particular atmosphere 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.750
 many people along the roads 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.760
 in the villages despite the late hour 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.590
 the night is also a special time 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:43.890
 for the crews everyone feels 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.110
 betrayed everyone we drooled already 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.390
 for 2h or 3h so we go full 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:56.820
 boots and there must be outdone with 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:58.620
 the smile a few hours and a few 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.719
 steps later we find them at 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.879
 goats in the oise the departure of 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.619
 Boulogne it was 24 hours ago at 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.180
 Intermediate ranking the Belgians 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.549
 Swiss are well placed Boulogne 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.450
 also despite the fatigue the concentration 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.450
 remains necessary 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.890
 with his two mares christine led 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.009
 a night step then another one 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.420
 early in the morning it's not easy 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.150
 oh you have to be just passionate 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.220
 then we have no pain anywhere and and the 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.659
 excavations are there for us for us 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.700
 cheer up even if we do not have 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.740
 too much sleep and then there are two mares 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.220
 exceptional in front of who ask that 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.100
 moving forward 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.570
 rabon the little pose not and for 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.299
 support those who hold the reins there 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.009
 y also for each crew 60 to 70 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.250
 people behind the scenes so that my 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.710
 honor be in good condition for for 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:51.060
 to make his road or his special must 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.040
 already eat well and sleep well a few 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.810
 kilometers still a little in the fields 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.420
 a little in the cities before the arrival at 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.430
 noon in Compiegne and to close 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.140
 the adventurous one last brilliant 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.800
 particularly technical and 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.780
 difficult 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.880
 four-horse driving 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.740
 the doors are spent barely more 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.180
 wide than the wheels of the hitches and 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.890
 to make it worse, you have to change 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:15.450
 the order of the horses being tested 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.950
 we always think that are those who are 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.330
 before the most important in 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.590
 realizes that when the front turn 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.810
 on one side they pay the arrears of 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.670
 the other to compensate for not 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.200
 take the epr banks and that's enough 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.030
 difficult to do well and when we have the 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.740
 chance to have two good choices and that we 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.330
 must go change as here have mostly 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.550
 with the help of my back in front and the 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:37.050
 behind that so it's really going 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:39.240
 there and at the end of this long journey 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.200
 the winning team features the famenne 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.150
 and Belgian 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.530
 the second is also meeting in 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.720
 third place is the Boulogne 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.440
 and especially the real big winner is 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.440
 the draft horse
