 the plant works 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.750
 continental construction site was

 male areas 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.110
 which is not surprising for the last 10 years 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.700
 this region is practically from zero scratched out 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.190

 17 times a year gross gain 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.510
 regional product amounted to 24 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.750

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.310
 economic growth in china for 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.290
 In recent years a lot has been built here. 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.810
 industrial parks with cars 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.820
 clusters and therefore doubly logical in 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.550
 one of them to see much needed in

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.520
 16 million first-class tires per year 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.770
 These figures are worth many years of experience and 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.870
 continental working methods for them 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.460
 there are quality criteria that are required 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.220
 match every produced 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.200
 aching behind them are people who want 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.330
 make the best product and past 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.370
 relevant training in germany and 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.740
 to answer the question why tires 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.240
 continental made in kaluga nothing 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.230
 will not differ from tires produced 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.850
 in hanover 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.840
 we invite you to look inside 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.310
 continental peg was built in 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.890
 keeping grand by far 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.570
 the company's going plans and on 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.860
 Today is still here 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:04.240
 room for expansion 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.000
 continental Kaluga releases winter and 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.520
 summer tires 3 company brands 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.990
 continental gislaved and matador where 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.300
 each brand will be represented by all 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.800
 standard sizes used now in 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.790
 Russia 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.680
 tire production technology 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.900
 fully consistent with a single 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.440
 standard continental which means 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.390
 following 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.700
 every tire off the assembly line 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:27.350
 Kaluga plant will undergo the same process 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:30.200
 creating that its counterpart in any country 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.060
 and where are the factories continental moreover 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.370
 each tire will be produced on such 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.150
 same equipment and using those 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.250
 same materials 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.340
 that in the whole world and here can not be 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.260
 no errors or inaccuracies recipe 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.510
 developed and in the laboratory can not 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.860
 be changed in no business 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.440
 and beyond modern equipment 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.450
 allows you to reconcile everything to grams and 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.120
 millimeters at the slightest suspicion 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:56.540
 the pipeline sends the current batch to 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.160
 marriage and so in every shop that way 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.830
 every tire released passes 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.960
 multiple checks but also on this 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.790
 quality control does not end on 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.710
 all stages of production process 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.690
 continental employees are watching 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.430
 many of whom have been trained in 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.710
 germany staff qualification 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.810
 lets you instantly determine everything goes 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.370
 according to plan and in case of the slightest deviations 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.040
 intervene in the process 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.740
 but that 's not all before you get there 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.150
 to the finished tire warehouse and passes 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.630
 individual testing on the test 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.030
 stand 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.890
 during this procedure all loads 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:30.170
 the tire is several times higher than normal 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:32.840
 so that the reliability of the product does not leave 

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:34.970
 doubt even skeptics and if so 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.980
 this stage, the finished tire shows 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.750
 the necessary result her path lies on 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.980
 warehouse from where soon to 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.620
 go to your happy

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.490
 like this continental once again 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.860
 left a mark on history in whole countries 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.600
 and this time the footprint is crucial 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.210
 we can truly be proud 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.550
 mark gelding rush made on each
