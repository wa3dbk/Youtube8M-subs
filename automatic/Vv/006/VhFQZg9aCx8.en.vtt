00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.349 
loops on our fingers how to close this
off<00:02:55.290> we're<00:02:56.290> going<00:02:56.440> to<00:02:56.849> have<00:02:57.849> the<00:02:57.970> tail<00:02:58.180> right

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
off we're going to have the tail right

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:02.970 
off we're going to have the tail right
here<00:02:59.489> take<00:03:00.489> one<00:03:00.519> loop<00:03:00.970> off<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:01.359> finger<00:03:01.980> the

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
here take one loop off the finger the

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.710 
here take one loop off the finger the
other<00:03:03.250> loop<00:03:03.640> off<00:03:03.849> the<00:03:04.180> finger<00:03:05.280> like<00:03:06.280> that

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
other loop off the finger like that

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.599 
other loop off the finger like that
they're<00:03:07.720> going<00:03:07.900> to<00:03:07.959> take<00:03:08.019> the<00:03:08.170> tail<00:03:08.379> and<00:03:08.620> put

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
they're going to take the tail and put

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:13.309 
they're going to take the tail and put
it<00:03:09.730> right<00:03:09.910> through<00:03:10.379> both<00:03:11.379> of<00:03:11.409> the<00:03:11.680> loops<00:03:11.799> and

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
it right through both of the loops and

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:19.460 
it right through both of the loops and
then<00:03:14.319> just<00:03:14.530> tighten<00:03:14.769> it

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.440 

and<00:03:19.590> if<00:03:20.220> you<00:03:20.340> want<00:03:20.550> to<00:03:20.640> make<00:03:20.790> a<00:03:20.820> knot<00:03:21.030> you<00:03:21.210> can

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
and if you want to make a knot you can

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:29.650 
and if you want to make a knot you can
which<00:03:21.720> I<00:03:21.900> am<00:03:22.260> going<00:03:22.320> to<00:03:22.830> do

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.410 

and<00:03:30.050> then<00:03:30.410> the<00:03:30.530> last<00:03:30.680> step<00:03:30.860> is<00:03:31.190> just<00:03:31.910> tying

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
and then the last step is just tying

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:44.530 
and then the last step is just tying
this<00:03:32.630> together<00:03:34.120> in<00:03:35.120> a<00:03:35.630> knot<00:03:37.630> double<00:03:38.630> knot

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:57.080 

and<00:03:44.629> then<00:03:45.409> just<00:03:46.189> cut<00:03:46.430> off<00:03:46.549> the<00:03:46.579> two<00:03:46.939> strands

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090
