00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.740 
I actually feel as though cornelia funke
forgot<00:05:26.199> she<00:05:26.410> was<00:05:26.440> writing<00:05:26.740> for<00:05:27.070> children<00:05:27.100> and

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
forgot she was writing for children and

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.940 
forgot she was writing for children and
sincerely<00:05:28.750> believed<00:05:29.169> that<00:05:29.380> if<00:05:29.530> i<00:05:29.620> had<00:05:29.800> read

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:29.950 
sincerely believed that if i had read

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.610 
sincerely believed that if i had read
this<00:05:30.190> when<00:05:30.639> I<00:05:30.669> was<00:05:31.030> in<00:05:31.450> the<00:05:31.930> intended<00:05:32.440> age

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
this when I was in the intended age

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:33.930 
this when I was in the intended age
group<00:05:32.860> I<00:05:33.010> wouldn't<00:05:33.370> have<00:05:33.490> been<00:05:33.580> able<00:05:33.700> to

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
group I wouldn't have been able to

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:34.860 
group I wouldn't have been able to
follow<00:05:34.090> it<00:05:34.300> at<00:05:34.450> all

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
follow it at all

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.690 
follow it at all
because<00:05:35.169> there's<00:05:35.620> so<00:05:35.889> many<00:05:36.039> characters<00:05:36.340> and

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:36.700 
because there's so many characters and

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.909 
because there's so many characters and
you're<00:05:36.820> constantly<00:05:37.060> jumping<00:05:37.930> from<00:05:38.440> one<00:05:38.740> point

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
you're constantly jumping from one point

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:41.430 
you're constantly jumping from one point
of<00:05:39.039> view<00:05:39.070> to<00:05:39.310> the<00:05:39.340> next<00:05:39.729> and<00:05:39.970> it's<00:05:40.930> just<00:05:41.229> it's

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
of view to the next and it's just it's

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.320 
of view to the next and it's just it's
too<00:05:41.680> confusing<00:05:42.160> also<00:05:42.700> I<00:05:42.729> think<00:05:42.910> that<00:05:43.090> this

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330 
too confusing also I think that this

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.240 
too confusing also I think that this
just<00:05:43.389> fails<00:05:44.020> as<00:05:44.320> a<00:05:44.680> middle-grade<00:05:45.010> novel

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
just fails as a middle-grade novel

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.750 
just fails as a middle-grade novel
because<00:05:46.090> in<00:05:46.419> the<00:05:46.720> end<00:05:46.870> it's<00:05:47.830> not<00:05:47.950> focused<00:05:48.610> on

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:48.760 
because in the end it's not focused on

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.180 
because in the end it's not focused on
the<00:05:48.940> children<00:05:49.470> protagonists<00:05:50.470> the<00:05:50.740> ones<00:05:50.919> who
