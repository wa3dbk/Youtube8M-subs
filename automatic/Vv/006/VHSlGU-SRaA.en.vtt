00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello and welcome to this 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.730
 video directly from the ifa the stand of 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.740
 digitalstrom has my attention 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.840
 excites me get a little 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.759
 Insight into the future of living and 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.099
 Although if you have all the appliances in the household 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.900
 Networking with each other offers some 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.850
 interesting possibilities which the 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.529
 and how it works will 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.970
 for the other side of the intro I wish 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.680
 Have fun with this video 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.300
 I'm looking forward to your opinion on 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.300
 end then so let's go 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.810
 this little thing is playing a lot 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.270
 decisive role in the networking 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.980
 of the house namely the topic is the 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.490
 boss by starving make no question 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.260
 what exactly defines 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.790
 this is a list that could be six 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.530
 Things she can turn on electricity 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.970
 Dimming and eating power of his computers 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.250
 sadness data needs to save 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.350
 specifically over the power line with it 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.500
 All devices in the house will light up 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.530
 Switches realize networking 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.960
 wise wise, that's it 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.449
 key game technologies the post 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.180
 are my whole apartment with this one 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.950
 tempos concluded off something 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.369
 in a flat in about 300.000 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.710
 dollar 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:17.210
 okay because I'm curious what this 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.590
 level with the apartment we changed 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.240
 here are quite normal 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.320
 Light switch just like you in every one 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.880
 Apartment can be found 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.650
 but you can still do more than that 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.720
 at home with me if I am here now 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.930
 once they push the light in 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.180
 the corner on whether I will two times it 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.580
 completely everything pulses activated all 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.920
 lights go on as well as the tv 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.979
 it will be particularly exciting when we are 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.690
 Look at this little lamp above though 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.660
 I once press on the button 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.700
 she goes out but now comes the clou 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.590
 who no longer presses on this 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.880
 Switch will complete everything 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.950
 Turn off what I want the customer 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.840
 is the interesting one 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.149
 digital current because if I enter here 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.490
 have networked got everything fail 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.110
 completely all taxes in the apartment were what 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.030
 networked is like me before 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.410
 you could have programmed so too 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.240
 adjust if under two times on it 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.940
 expresses that the refrigerator goes out or 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.130
 The iron living room is on and off 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.140
 left and sometimes longer it three 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.190
 seconds, then an emergency 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.990
 alarm triggered 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.160
 on the television then comes the same 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.600
 sos and now this will be alone 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.940
 agreement if you so like me 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.350
 then through you only with music and in 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.780
 future it can give your bathroom already 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.500
 know here in the bathroom comes nfc technology 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.380
 for use 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.930
 Here you see the nfc tag one now mine 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.420
 mobile drauflegen then know that smart 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.920
 bad hd exists because now would like 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.380
 take a shower at the and 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.440
 temperature in chanty me not to 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.560
 and the music plays super awesome find 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.560
 I 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.980
 now I stand with the frederik in the 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.349
 We have a tablet here with us 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.190
 the kitchen appliances networked here 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.739
 relegation of the tour story 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.660
 we have the app the cook board and the 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.819
 head of list represents recipes voted 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.349
 step forward and the respective heavier 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:13.209
 the appropriate devices will control that 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:16.450
 I automatically press on it 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.470
 So comes an audio system and others 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.840
 be cut out 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.180
 the finished and automatically washed 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.170
 the faucet will be turned on if he does 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.180
 is done 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.670
 Just wash a sensor and wash 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.860
 think and the water never again 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.880
 Nature's with it too automatically 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.799
 stop or you have the paprika 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.450
 industry cuts let's say 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:40.830
 now comes the next step the pt 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.830
 continue to activate 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:49.990
 the system is at stake and yes 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:52.150
 Will you call the next help 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.870
 because it is not every kitchen system 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.850
 equip 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.900
 at only old church do not accompany the 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.790
 modern interfaces 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.270
 but maybe you a nice modern one 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.850
 kitchen here to cook a restraint 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.190
 The martin is an app center smartphone 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.930
 with the remote access his right 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.890
 This is the home of homeowners 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.750
 with the m 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.220
 So I can control everything, which I can 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.200
 can control via push button 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.570
 But I can do more because I am 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.760
 also get information displayed 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.650
 such as power consumption one 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.600
 Other options to control 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.630
 then ultimately also about language 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.690
 please try the light in the 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.370
 switch off the storage room 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:33.550
 now the entranced is defined um 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.660
 at my home committees super great 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.490
 interesting I would probably 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.410
 abuse manipulation annoy the 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.630
 me just complete schools with 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.540
 dark make but very useful very 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.740
 practically 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.330
 he's already doing just now 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.830
 you can cut them in 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.640
 detailed consumption overview 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.790
 display 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.500
 instead , the tablet is brought instead 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.540
 So what precisely we present is 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.130
 need electricity everywhere on only devices 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.620
 but as here, for example, on the 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.480
 single rooms that just knows how much 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.400
 electricity is consumed so much 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.320
 detailed but also in the overview 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.750
 ok so now if i delete one 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.550
 from 1000 euro gets now I can exactly 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.580
 understand that we have the fridge 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.650
 or that was the one lamp that always 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.390
 just about every single device has 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.280
 I could stand one myself and I could 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:21.630
 then check who the main 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:23.640
 Consumers in the house is great as me 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.380
 I'm back in my stupid apartment though 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.850
 I thought it was just exciting times are me 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.500
 to look at the smartphone from up close 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.760
 simply because I am very personal 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.320
 could very well imagine in 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.990
 future in a smart apartment 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:36.090
 to live and the system of digital current 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.710
 I found it interesting because you're there 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.270
 what is the existing so takes the electricity 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.310
 networking in the household and in the 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.470
 build a small clamp on it and it 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.970
 suddenly I am intelligent 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.500
 by burning what you care about 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.120
 I can hold the whole story 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.570
 on researching a smart apartment 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.860
 to live 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.300
 or maybe you even find it 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.240
 scary when the apartment suddenly 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.280
 smart will let the comments 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.690
 discussing with each other 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.820
 I have already done in video 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.530
 So, for the future of reading, also something 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.210
 what might come in the future 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.220
 I also want a spox description 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:07.380
 super interesting technology and the 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.090
 video title here is the future of living 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.190
 actually wrong because it works 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.700
 good food and a little money 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:14.010
 needs stop 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.730
 modern devices that interface 

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:17.370
 to have 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:19.200
 but it would theoretically be possible 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.570
 and I hope that I will be in the foreseeable future 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:24.570
 Enjoy the time in a wise one 

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:27.560
 flat to live okay then until the 

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:27.560
 next time at night people
