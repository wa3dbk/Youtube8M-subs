00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
event here the iSeries vent is very

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.650 
event here the iSeries vent is very
different<00:02:48.040> to<00:02:48.250> probably<00:02:48.610> many<00:02:49.150> other<00:02:49.330> events

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
different to probably many other events

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.630 
different to probably many other events
you've<00:02:49.810> experienced<00:02:50.410> do<00:02:50.980> you<00:02:51.070> like<00:02:51.280> this<00:02:51.430> kind

he's a Korean and my TVT is fairly solid

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.540 
he's a Korean and my TVT is fairly solid
but<00:03:54.160> it<00:03:54.610> feels<00:03:55.060> random<00:03:55.510> too<00:03:55.900> because<00:03:56.680> proxy

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
but it feels random too because proxy

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.270 
but it feels random too because proxy
Reapers<00:03:57.970> yeah<00:03:58.420> if<00:03:58.630> I<00:03:58.840> scored<00:03:59.230> after<00:03:59.500> my<00:03:59.920> Depot

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
Reapers yeah if I scored after my Depot

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.920 
Reapers yeah if I scored after my Depot
it's<00:04:01.140> too<00:04:02.140> fast<00:04:02.440> to<00:04:03.010> play<00:04:03.220> standard<00:04:03.820> like<00:04:04.720> if

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
it's too fast to play standard like if

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.120 
it's too fast to play standard like if
he<00:04:05.520> if<00:04:06.520> enemy<00:04:07.360> goes<00:04:07.600> for<00:04:07.960> command<00:04:08.800> center

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
he if enemy goes for command center

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.790 
he if enemy goes for command center
first<00:04:09.310> and<00:04:09.550> I<00:04:09.700> the<00:04:09.760> cool<00:04:10.240> Scout<00:04:10.570> it's<00:04:11.380> not<00:04:11.620> too

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
first and I the cool Scout it's not too

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.980 
first and I the cool Scout it's not too
good<00:04:12.010> so<00:04:12.430> it<00:04:12.670> feels<00:04:12.880> a<00:04:13.150> bit<00:04:13.180> random<00:04:13.600> in<00:04:13.900> the

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:13.990 
good so it feels a bit random in the

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.200 
good so it feels a bit random in the
early<00:04:14.230> game<00:04:14.410> but<00:04:14.440> it<00:04:15.160> should<00:04:15.400> be<00:04:15.430> fine<00:04:15.790> too

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:16.210 
early game but it should be fine too

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:18.510 
early game but it should be fine too
now<00:04:17.020> on<00:04:17.350> to<00:04:17.530> heart<00:04:17.710> of<00:04:17.770> the<00:04:17.860> swarm<00:04:18.040> a<00:04:18.160> bit<00:04:18.340> here

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:18.520 
now on to heart of the swarm a bit here

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.340 
now on to heart of the swarm a bit here
what<00:04:19.030> are<00:04:19.120> your<00:04:19.210> favorite<00:04:19.630> features<00:04:19.780> of<00:04:20.049> heart

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
what are your favorite features of heart

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.080 
what are your favorite features of heart
of<00:04:20.410> the<00:04:20.500> swarm<00:04:20.680> so<00:04:21.010> far<00:04:21.310> and<00:04:21.580> is<00:04:21.850> there<00:04:21.970> any

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
of the swarm so far and is there any

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.290 
of the swarm so far and is there any
bits<00:04:22.300> that<00:04:22.390> you<00:04:22.510> really<00:04:23.050> don't<00:04:23.230> like<00:04:23.410> I<00:04:24.300> don't

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
bits that you really don't like I don't

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.920 
bits that you really don't like I don't
like

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
like

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.180 
like
the<00:04:27.970> computer<00:04:28.970> the<00:04:29.210> IE

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
the computer the IE

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.740 
the computer the IE
yeah<00:04:31.690> because<00:04:32.690> it's<00:04:33.259> pretty<00:04:34.039> bad<00:04:34.750> science

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
yeah because it's pretty bad science

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.420 
yeah because it's pretty bad science
right<00:04:36.460> yeah<00:04:37.460> they<00:04:38.150> could<00:04:38.900> make<00:04:39.169> it<00:04:39.380> better<00:04:39.740> and

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
right yeah they could make it better and

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.659 
right yeah they could make it better and
it's<00:04:41.000> cool<00:04:41.300> they<00:04:41.539> try<00:04:42.080> to<00:04:42.139> make<00:04:43.039> ie

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
it's cool they try to make ie

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:49.390 
it's cool they try to make ie
AI<00:04:44.210> a<00:04:44.720> bit<00:04:45.970> intelligent<00:04:46.970> and<00:04:48.009> in<00:04:49.009> multiplayer

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
AI a bit intelligent and in multiplayer

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.850 
AI a bit intelligent and in multiplayer
I<00:04:50.120> think<00:04:50.449> it's<00:04:51.080> pretty<00:04:52.449> good<00:04:53.449> because

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
I think it's pretty good because

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.010 
I think it's pretty good because
everyone<00:04:54.860> not<00:04:55.550> just<00:04:55.580> camping<00:04:56.300> like<00:04:56.509> robot

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
everyone not just camping like robot

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.640 
everyone not just camping like robot
yeah

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
yeah

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.510 
yeah
in<00:04:57.710> festive<00:04:58.130> and<00:04:59.470> modern<00:05:00.470> dynamic<00:05:01.009> in<00:05:01.400> the
