easier<00:04:08.910> than<00:04:09.180> a<00:04:09.360> horse<00:04:09.690> on<00:04:09.870> the<00:04:10.080> outside<00:04:10.700> now

there<00:04:11.880> are<00:04:12.000> three<00:04:12.090> types<00:04:12.660> of<00:04:12.900> horses<00:04:13.410> that

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
there are three types of horses that

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.110 
there are three types of horses that
race<00:04:14.580> we<00:04:15.570> call<00:04:15.840> them<00:04:16.020> frontrunners<00:04:17.120> stalkers

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120

and<00:04:18.239> closers<00:04:19.160> frontrunners<00:04:20.160> are<00:04:20.190> just<00:04:20.730> that

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
and closers frontrunners are just that

those<00:04:21.540> are<00:04:21.720> horses<00:04:22.020> that<00:04:22.260> like<00:04:22.620> to<00:04:22.830> be<00:04:23.040> on<00:04:23.280> the

those are horses that like to be on the

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.420 
those are horses that like to be on the
front<00:04:24.180> or<00:04:24.419> right<00:04:24.840> near<00:04:25.229> the<00:04:25.470> pace<00:04:25.710> they<00:04:26.220> like

to<00:04:26.460> control<00:04:26.970> this

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
to control this

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.960

these type of horses don't do well in

these type of horses don't do well in
the<00:04:33.190> Kentucky<00:04:33.520> Derby<00:04:34.150> the<00:04:34.690> reason<00:04:35.140> for<00:04:35.170> that

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
the Kentucky Derby the reason for that

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.270 
the Kentucky Derby the reason for that
is<00:04:35.740> because<00:04:36.160> you've<00:04:37.120> got<00:04:37.420> a<00:04:37.630> big<00:04:38.110> field<00:04:38.530> a<00:04:38.800> lot

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
is because you've got a big field a lot

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.850 
is because you've got a big field a lot
of<00:04:39.490> horses<00:04:39.840> generally<00:04:40.840> you're<00:04:41.410> going<00:04:41.620> to<00:04:41.680> get

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
of horses generally you're going to get

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.860 
of horses generally you're going to get
a<00:04:41.920> faster<00:04:42.550> fraction<00:04:43.150> at<00:04:43.300> the<00:04:43.420> beginning<00:04:43.810> of

a faster fraction at the beginning of

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.080 
a faster fraction at the beginning of
the<00:04:43.990> race<00:04:44.140> the<00:04:45.010> faster<00:04:45.520> you<00:04:45.550> go<00:04:45.850> at<00:04:46.000> the

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
the race the faster you go at the

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.150 
the race the faster you go at the
beginning<00:04:46.390> of<00:04:46.570> the<00:04:46.690> race<00:04:46.840> the<00:04:47.560> less<00:04:47.800> you<00:04:47.830> have

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
beginning of the race the less you have

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.100 
beginning of the race the less you have
left<00:04:48.550> for<00:04:48.880> the<00:04:49.000> end<00:04:49.180> of<00:04:49.450> the<00:04:49.570> race<00:04:49.750> and<00:04:49.960> that's

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
left for the end of the race and that's

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.860 
left for the end of the race and that's
why<00:04:50.350> frontrunners<00:04:51.190> generally<00:04:51.880> do<00:04:52.300> not<00:04:52.330> do

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
why frontrunners generally do not do

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.260 
why frontrunners generally do not do
well<00:04:53.080> with<00:04:53.140> the<00:04:53.380> Kentucky<00:04:53.770> Derby<00:04:54.370> there<00:04:55.090> have

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
well with the Kentucky Derby there have

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.120 
well with the Kentucky Derby there have
been<00:04:55.480> a<00:04:55.510> few<00:04:55.600> frontrunners<00:04:56.440> that<00:04:56.650> have<00:04:56.800> been

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
been a few frontrunners that have been

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.160 
been a few frontrunners that have been
able<00:04:57.280> to<00:04:57.520> win<00:04:57.670> the<00:04:57.820> Kentucky<00:04:58.300> Derby<00:04:58.330> and<00:04:58.780> when

00:04:59.160 --> 00:04:59.170 
able to win the Kentucky Derby and when

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.380 
able to win the Kentucky Derby and when
this<00:04:59.290> happens<00:04:59.860> usually<00:05:00.700> it's<00:05:00.850> a<00:05:00.940> horse<00:05:01.180> that

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.390 
this happens usually it's a horse that

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.620 
this happens usually it's a horse that
gets<00:05:01.630> on<00:05:01.870> the<00:05:02.770> lead<00:05:03.010> nobody<00:05:03.940> can<00:05:04.150> test<00:05:04.420> the

gets on the lead nobody can test the

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.690 
gets on the lead nobody can test the
fractions<00:05:05.170> and<00:05:05.320> he<00:05:05.710> gets<00:05:05.920> away<00:05:06.070> with<00:05:06.400> soft

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
fractions and he gets away with soft

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.450 
fractions and he gets away with soft
fractions<00:05:07.360> that<00:05:07.510> is<00:05:08.140> not<00:05:08.620> the<00:05:08.890> norm<00:05:09.190> in<00:05:09.370> the

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
Kentucky Derby reason for that is

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.440 
Kentucky Derby reason for that is
they're<00:05:41.530> not<00:05:41.800> on<00:05:42.010> the<00:05:42.160> front<00:05:42.460> end<00:05:42.700> but<00:05:43.300> they're
