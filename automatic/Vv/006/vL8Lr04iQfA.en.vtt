John hopefully you can sort of see that
let's<00:00:11.370> say<00:00:12.379> how<00:00:13.379> I<00:00:13.410> get<00:00:13.590> most<00:00:14.010> of<00:00:14.100> my<00:00:14.160> time<00:00:14.490> from

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
let's say how I get most of my time from

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.060 
let's say how I get most of my time from
Cordy<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.510> then<00:00:16.199> sometimes<00:00:16.650> you<00:00:16.740> have<00:00:16.920> to

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
Cordy and then sometimes you have to

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.419 
Cordy and then sometimes you have to
correct<00:00:17.400> them<00:00:17.900> they<00:00:18.900> aren't<00:00:19.619> always<00:00:19.830> you<00:00:20.310> know

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:20.429 
correct them they aren't always you know

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:24.290 
correct them they aren't always you know
true<00:00:20.849> or<00:00:22.339> someone's<00:00:23.339> version<00:00:23.820> just<00:00:24.150> like

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
true or someone's version just like

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.189 
true or someone's version just like
cheap<00:00:24.599> books<00:00:24.900> they're<00:00:25.320> not<00:00:25.500> always<00:00:25.830> 100%<00:00:26.460> true

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
cheap books they're not always 100% true

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:29.989 
cheap books they're not always 100% true
so<00:00:28.199> just<00:00:28.529> because<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:29.099> read<00:00:29.339> it<00:00:29.519> doesn't<00:00:29.849> mean

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:29.999 
so just because it read it doesn't mean

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:33.620 
so just because it read it doesn't mean
that<00:00:30.029> it's<00:00:30.390> 100%<00:00:31.140> correct<00:00:32.060> the<00:00:33.060> one<00:00:33.240> that<00:00:33.450> you

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
that it's 100% correct the one that you

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.779 
that it's 100% correct the one that you
wanted<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:33.960> hear<00:00:34.050> this<00:00:34.260> time<00:00:34.530> was<00:00:34.860> changes<00:00:35.640> in
