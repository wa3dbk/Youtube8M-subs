 the pool is used in this film and the metal frame pool 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.550
 ultra rectangular 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.099
 the 549 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:09.940
 by 274 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.879
 because in 32 cents 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:15.209
 the number of coins provided bets slightly depending on the size of the 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:16.139
 swimming pool 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.130
 check 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.400
 that you have

 all the items listed in the menu 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.329
 to begin by assembling the missing pieces 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:29.279
 call customer service a text to receive spare parts

 you must install your pool on a completely flat ground 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.540
 to balance the water level 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.480
 leave at least two meters of clearance all around the pool 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.480
 for side supports 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.650
 the drawing may become unstable if it leans to one side 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.040
 once filled the pool should never be moved 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.210
 installed there within range of garden hoses and an electrical outlet of 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.470
 type of subjects to seize 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.900
 the pool should not be wrong against the wall of the house 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.440
 think about the best locations of the skin 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.440
 so that no one risks tripping over the power cable 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.560
 some municipalities require a fence around the pool 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.190
 ask

 carefully removed the only one from any object risking the busy 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.300
 a tarp of balances constitute an additional protection 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.400
 and what is the solution

 while verifying 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:45.230
 he comes from a place 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.730
 the line but not the pool on the ground you would risk the breakthrough 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.020
 to locate the hole locations of the filter fittings 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.350
 check that they are well in phase with the future location of the troop 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.310
 make sure again that you can reach an optical outlet I have to 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.200
 seville with the electric cord 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.060
 the test of plastic heat in the sun to facilitate the insertion of the tubes 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.259
 armature 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.259
 group the tubes by their masters to 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:16.689
 6 it is rare

 starting with listening to london 

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:30.849
 drive a tube headlight to our whites first as the sleeve situate why 

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:36.329
 continue by snapping even you can give yourself in the tube to 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:40.459
 assembly is easier it is another person who is German 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.459
 open yards while you sink studies 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:49.129
 the diagram of the manual indicates the number of tubes and folds for your pool 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.559
 finished the side by a tube c 

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:59.449
 hold the metal tube in alignment with the sleeve orifices 

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:00.939
 White

 installed in the same way the tubes on the opposite side 

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:09.259
 assemble the cubs at the end of the plastic starting with the tube d 

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:10.709
 then the tube 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:11.679
 remain 

00:03:11.679 --> 00:03:14.679
 edgar mined by a tube f 

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:18.429
 check again the alignments of the troops with the sleeves 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.860
 before introducing the big ones support more their in-goal by the Turkish army 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:27.240

 like this site 

00:03:30.679 --> 00:03:35.529
 hold the frame flat on the ground to facilitate insertion of the supras 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:40.529
 by depressing the lower tiller of the spring clips 

00:03:40.529 --> 00:03:43.459
 introduce support in consumer products 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.789

 in addition to the media 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.949
 place the top edges of the wall the om 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:44.389
 in support of the upper edges of the afar near the arjel 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:47.389
 install advanced tubes as a track 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:52.060
 return it to the main menu to view the assembly instructions for

 that the holes of the filter fittings are in front of the future location 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:19.430
 from the pump
