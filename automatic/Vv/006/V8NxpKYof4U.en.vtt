00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689

be<00:01:48.810> metal<00:01:49.320> not<00:01:49.619> sure<00:01:49.860> though<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.280> they<00:01:51.180> have

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.760 
be metal not sure though and they have
very<00:01:51.750> very<00:01:52.079> very<00:01:52.439> soft<00:01:52.740> ear<00:01:53.009> cups<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:54.770> that's

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
very very very soft ear cups and that's

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.130 
very very very soft ear cups and that's
it<00:01:55.950> really
