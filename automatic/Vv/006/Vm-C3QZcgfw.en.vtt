00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
Theo and nayer who both need one a star

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.349 
Theo and nayer who both need one a star
and<00:00:21.380> two<00:00:21.890> ways<00:00:22.070> to<00:00:22.310> get<00:00:22.429> into<00:00:22.609> University<00:00:22.820> now

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:23.359 
and two ways to get into University now

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:26.310 
and two ways to get into University now
Theo<00:00:23.570> you<00:00:23.810> did<00:00:23.960> maths<00:00:24.259> and<00:00:25.220> physics<00:00:25.250> and

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
Theo you did maths and physics and

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.779 
Theo you did maths and physics and
Norris<00:00:27.320> and<00:00:27.589> further<00:00:27.890> maths<00:00:28.130> as<00:00:28.310> well<00:00:28.490> and

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 
Norris and further maths as well and

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:30.490 
Norris and further maths as well and
they<00:00:29.150> are<00:00:29.179> you<00:00:29.390> did<00:00:29.509> all<00:00:29.630> the<00:00:29.869> sciences<00:00:30.349> and

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
they are you did all the sciences and

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.440 
they are you did all the sciences and
maths<00:00:30.740> and<00:00:31.099> science<00:00:31.699> is<00:00:31.820> what<00:00:31.939> I<00:00:31.970> suggest<00:00:32.180> is

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
maths and science is what I suggest is

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.970 
maths and science is what I suggest is
respected<00:00:32.900> to<00:00:32.990> drop<00:00:33.200> this<00:00:33.320> year<00:00:33.470> did<00:00:33.650> you<00:00:33.680> find

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
respected to drop this year did you find

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.680 
respected to drop this year did you find
that<00:00:34.100> particularly<00:00:34.579> difficult<00:00:34.730> yeah<00:00:35.390> I<00:00:35.420> think

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
that particularly difficult yeah I think

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.900 
that particularly difficult yeah I think
chemistry<00:00:36.500> especially<00:00:36.890> was<00:00:37.520> a<00:00:37.550> lot<00:00:37.730> harder

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
chemistry especially was a lot harder

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.360 
chemistry especially was a lot harder
than<00:00:38.030> mutts<00:00:38.360> this<00:00:38.570> year<00:00:38.750> so<00:00:39.050> it<00:00:39.770> did<00:00:40.010> come<00:00:40.340> up

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
than mutts this year so it did come up

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.760 
than mutts this year so it did come up
how<00:00:40.730> hard<00:00:40.910> the<00:00:41.210> examples<00:00:41.539> were<00:00:41.629> really<00:00:42.230> okay

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
how hard the examples were really okay

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:43.869 
how hard the examples were really okay
yeah<00:00:42.890> we<00:00:43.010> know<00:00:43.100> a<00:00:43.129> lot<00:00:43.309> of<00:00:43.430> people<00:00:43.760> were<00:00:43.850> not

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
yeah we know a lot of people were not

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:45.549 
yeah we know a lot of people were not
happy<00:00:44.300> with<00:00:44.329> that<00:00:44.510> chemistry<00:00:44.870> exam<00:00:45.079> well

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
happy with that chemistry exam well

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:47.200 
happy with that chemistry exam well
let's<00:00:46.010> let<00:00:46.190> you<00:00:46.309> open<00:00:46.640> your<00:00:46.789> results<00:00:47.149> because

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
let's let you open your results because

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.000 
let's let you open your results because
