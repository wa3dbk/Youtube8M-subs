think this is actually the end or either
that<00:01:15.720> or<00:01:15.869> it's<00:01:16.080> just<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.380> big<00:01:16.530> ammo<00:01:16.860> cache<00:01:17.100> with

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
that or it's just a big ammo cache with

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.580 
that or it's just a big ammo cache with
rockets<00:01:18.030> for<00:01:18.270> your<00:01:18.479> non-existent<00:01:18.720> Lockett

launcher<00:01:20.040> why<00:01:20.850> did<00:01:21.030> they<00:01:21.119> even<00:01:21.150> get<00:01:21.570> those<00:01:21.869> in

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
launcher why did they even get those in

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.749 
launcher why did they even get those in
here<00:01:24.229> maybe<00:01:25.229> they<00:01:25.500> put<00:01:25.740> them<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.100> but<00:01:26.610> then

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
here maybe they put them in but then

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.280 
here maybe they put them in but then
they<00:01:26.880> decided<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.750> rocket<00:01:28.080> launcher

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
they decided and the rocket launcher

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.749 
they decided and the rocket launcher
would<00:01:28.380> make<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:28.650> part<00:01:28.920> too<00:01:29.040> easy<00:01:29.280> let's<00:01:29.549> take

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.830 

now<00:01:59.920> once<00:02:00.310> you<00:02:00.400> get<00:02:00.520> up<00:02:00.640> here<00:02:01.030> go<00:02:01.600> ahead<00:02:01.720> and

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
now once you get up here go ahead and

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.360 
now once you get up here go ahead and

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
head up this way now I think if you

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.070 
head up this way now I think if you
don't<00:02:03.580> hit<00:02:03.760> the<00:02:03.790> switch<00:02:04.180> this<00:02:04.479> won't<00:02:04.690> even<00:02:04.780> be

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
don't hit the switch this won't even be
