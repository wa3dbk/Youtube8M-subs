best<00:00:33.320> signature<00:00:34.320> reverb<00:00:34.710> sounds<00:00:35.100> into<00:00:35.250> this

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
best signature reverb sounds into this

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.939 
best signature reverb sounds into this
pedal<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.269> of<00:00:37.199> course<00:00:37.379> we<00:00:37.500> had<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.650> do<00:00:37.800> the

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:37.949 
pedal and of course we had to do the

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:40.100 
pedal and of course we had to do the
standard<00:00:38.940> basic<00:00:39.540> ones<00:00:39.720> that<00:00:39.960> everybody

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
standard basic ones that everybody

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.270 
standard basic ones that everybody
expects<00:00:40.800> hall<00:00:41.309> room<00:00:42.019> plate<00:00:43.019> we<00:00:43.769> got<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:43.949> killer

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
expects hall room plate we got a killer

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.689 
expects hall room plate we got a killer
spring<00:00:44.699> reverb<00:00:45.140> but<00:00:46.140> then<00:00:46.350> since<00:00:46.680> we<00:00:47.309> have<00:00:47.489> all

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:47.699 
spring reverb but then since we have all

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:52.789 
spring reverb but then since we have all
these<00:00:48.500> wacky<00:00:49.940> really<00:00:50.960> ambient<00:00:51.960> reverbs<00:00:52.500> we

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:52.799 
these wacky really ambient reverbs we

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:55.030 
these wacky really ambient reverbs we
had<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.100> throw<00:00:53.280> those<00:00:53.430> in<00:00:53.580> there<00:00:53.610> as<00:00:53.820> well<00:00:54.000> so

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
had to throw those in there as well so

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.329 
had to throw those in there as well so
one<00:00:56.040> of<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.390> more<00:00:58.010> signature<00:00:59.010> ones<00:00:59.159> it's

00:00:59.329 --> 00:00:59.339 
one of the more signature ones it's

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:01.039 
one of the more signature ones it's
called<00:00:59.489> black<00:00:59.670> hole<00:00:59.909> this<00:01:00.540> is<00:01:00.690> taken<00:01:00.960> directly

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:01.049 
called black hole this is taken directly

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:03.500 
called black hole this is taken directly
from<00:01:01.290> our<00:01:01.680> flagship<00:01:02.339> product<00:01:02.580> which<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.150> h

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
from our flagship product which is the h

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.870 
from our flagship product which is the h
eight<00:01:03.720> thousand<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.379> it's<00:01:05.250> running<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.670> same

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
eight thousand and it's running the same

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.219 
eight thousand and it's running the same
algorithm<00:01:06.510> so<00:01:06.659> if<00:01:06.720> you're<00:01:06.840> familiar<00:01:06.960> with

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
algorithm so if you're familiar with

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.800 
algorithm so if you're familiar with
that<00:01:07.380> product<00:01:08.040> you'll<00:01:08.430> you'll<00:01:09.330> recognize

that product you'll you'll recognize
this<00:01:10.009> and<00:01:11.009> this<00:01:11.310> has<00:01:11.520> been<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.450> lot<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.630> movie

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
this and this has been in a lot of movie

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.779 
this and this has been in a lot of movie
soundtracks<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.649> stuff<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.159> here's<00:01:14.640> what

00:01:14.779 --> 00:01:14.789 
soundtracks and stuff so here's what

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:35.240 
soundtracks and stuff so here's what
this<00:01:14.909> sounds<00:01:15.210> like

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.730 

and<00:01:36.090> what<00:01:36.750> what's<00:01:37.200> cool<00:01:37.410> about<00:01:37.440> this

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
and what what's cool about this

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.400 
and what what's cool about this
affecting<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.520> stompbox<00:01:39.060> now<00:01:39.330> is<00:01:39.690> that

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
affecting of stompbox now is that

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.670 
affecting of stompbox now is that
there's<00:01:41.040> knobs<00:01:41.370> that<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.780> can<00:01:43.020> tweak<00:01:43.380> in<00:01:43.530> real

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
there's knobs that you can tweak in real

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.680 
there's knobs that you can tweak in real
time<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.280> use<00:01:44.820> them<00:01:44.940> as<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.090> live<00:01:45.240> performance

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
time and use them as a live performance

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.440 
time and use them as a live performance
so<00:01:46.440> that's<00:01:47.310> something<00:01:47.520> on<00:01:47.940> the<00:01:48.090> rack<00:01:48.240> was<00:01:48.420> a

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
so that's something on the rack was a

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.570 
so that's something on the rack was a
little<00:01:48.660> more<00:01:48.720> difficult<00:01:48.900> to<00:01:49.229> do<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.950> like<00:01:50.370> for

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
little more difficult to do so like for

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.070 
little more difficult to do so like for
example<00:01:50.610> if<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.330> play<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.570> note<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:51.990> then

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
example if you play a note and then

00:01:52.080 --> 00:02:07.010 
example if you play a note and then
tweak<00:01:52.410> the<00:01:52.619> size<00:01:52.979> knob<00:02:05.570> use<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.720> as<00:02:06.810> an

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
tweak the size knob use it as an

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.979 
tweak the size knob use it as an
instrument<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:08.119> lot<00:02:09.119> of<00:02:09.209> changes<00:02:09.479> in<00:02:09.509> real<00:02:09.750> time

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
instrument a lot of changes in real time

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.210 
instrument a lot of changes in real time
now<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.200> have<00:02:10.440> some<00:02:10.619> more<00:02:10.739> traditional

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
now you have some more traditional

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.490 
now you have some more traditional
reverbs<00:02:11.580> here<00:02:11.820> so<00:02:12.090> I'm<00:02:12.150> associated<00:02:12.870> with<00:02:13.410> the

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
reverbs here so I'm associated with the

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.110 
reverbs here so I'm associated with the
3000<00:02:14.040> unit<00:02:14.250> which<00:02:14.370> is<00:02:14.520> associated<00:02:14.820> with<00:02:15.030> the

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
3000 unit which is associated with the

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.290 
3000 unit which is associated with the
edge<00:02:15.270> of<00:02:15.480> course<00:02:15.720> right<00:02:16.020> yes<00:02:16.410> exactly<00:02:17.209> one<00:02:18.209> of

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
edge of course right yes exactly one of

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.240 
edge of course right yes exactly one of
those<00:02:18.390> effects<00:02:18.750> is<00:02:18.870> that<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.560> edge<00:02:19.709> you<00:02:20.070> two

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
those effects is that the edge you two

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.670 
those effects is that the edge you two
made<00:02:20.550> famous<00:02:21.380> was<00:02:22.380> shimmer<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:24.500> sort<00:02:25.500> of<00:02:25.590> the

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
made famous was shimmer and sort of the

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.140 
made famous was shimmer and sort of the
unforgettable<00:02:26.220> fire<00:02:26.400> sound<00:02:26.790> is<00:02:26.940> that<00:02:27.060> what

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
unforgettable fire sound is that what

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.320 
unforgettable fire sound is that what
this<00:02:27.239> something<00:02:27.959> like<00:02:28.050> that<00:02:28.110> yeah<00:02:28.410> I<00:02:29.209> see<00:02:30.209> we

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
this something like that yeah I see we

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.970 
this something like that yeah I see we
can<00:02:30.450> do<00:02:30.600> I<00:02:30.630> don't<00:02:30.900> actually<00:02:31.470> know<00:02:31.560> how<00:02:31.680> to<00:02:31.709> play

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
can do I don't actually know how to play

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.640 
can do I don't actually know how to play
the<00:02:32.100> real<00:02:32.220> thing<00:02:32.459> but<00:02:32.640> uh<00:02:32.989> you<00:02:33.989> know<00:02:34.020> with<00:02:34.560> this

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
you don't have to play much to get the

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:59.570 
you don't have to play much to get the
effect<00:02:36.239> it's<00:02:36.450> just<00:02:36.600> like<00:02:37.140> arpeggios<00:02:37.800> here

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.790 

so<00:03:00.510> there's<00:03:00.660> a<00:03:00.720> lot<00:03:00.930> of<00:03:00.960> versatility<00:03:01.410> this

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
so there's a lot of versatility this

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.470 
so there's a lot of versatility this
unit<00:03:02.190> a<00:03:02.280> rock<00:03:02.490> player<00:03:02.760> could<00:03:03.030> use<00:03:03.180> it<00:03:03.360> an

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
unit a rock player could use it an

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.360 
unit a rock player could use it an
ambient<00:03:03.960> music<00:03:04.110> producer<00:03:04.860> could<00:03:05.010> use<00:03:05.190> it

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
ambient music producer could use it

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.680 
ambient music producer could use it
there's<00:03:05.760> also<00:03:05.880> some<00:03:06.120> really<00:03:06.300> traditional

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
there's also some really traditional

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.930 
there's also some really traditional
stuff<00:03:06.900> like<00:03:07.050> plate<00:03:07.890> reverb<00:03:08.070> or<00:03:08.310> spring<00:03:08.610> rivers

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
stuff like plate reverb or spring rivers

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.550 
stuff like plate reverb or spring rivers
rather<00:03:09.240> you<00:03:09.780> want<00:03:09.930> to<00:03:10.020> show<00:03:10.110> us<00:03:10.200> some<00:03:10.350> of<00:03:10.380> those

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
rather you want to show us some of those

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.360 
rather you want to show us some of those
yeah<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:12.240> spring<00:03:12.630> reverb<00:03:12.750> is<00:03:13.220> one<00:03:14.220> of<00:03:14.310> the

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
yeah the spring reverb is one of the

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.980 
yeah the spring reverb is one of the
effect<00:03:14.610> is<00:03:14.700> actually<00:03:15.090> brand-new<00:03:15.600> to<00:03:15.870> this

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
effect is actually brand-new to this

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.390 
effect is actually brand-new to this
stompbox<00:03:16.530> it's<00:03:16.680> not<00:03:16.800> in<00:03:16.920> any<00:03:17.010> of<00:03:17.130> our<00:03:17.310> other

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
stompbox it's not in any of our other

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.360 
stompbox it's not in any of our other
products<00:03:17.880> we<00:03:18.870> design<00:03:19.170> it<00:03:19.200> from<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:19.980> ground<00:03:20.100> up

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
products we design it from the ground up

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.670 
products we design it from the ground up
and<00:03:22.040> it's<00:03:23.040> a<00:03:23.430> spring<00:03:24.300> emulator<00:03:24.780> and<00:03:25.080> you<00:03:25.500> can

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
and it's a spring emulator and you can

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.060 
and it's a spring emulator and you can
adjust<00:03:26.300> the<00:03:27.300> physical<00:03:27.810> characteristics<00:03:28.650> of

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
adjust the physical characteristics of

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.460 
adjust the physical characteristics of
the<00:03:29.220> spring<00:03:29.520> like<00:03:29.700> how<00:03:29.910> tense<00:03:30.660> they<00:03:30.930> are<00:03:31.290> how

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
the spring like how tense they are how

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.800 
the spring like how tense they are how
loose<00:03:31.710> they<00:03:31.920> are<00:03:32.070> how<00:03:32.640> many<00:03:32.700> Springs<00:03:33.300> are<00:03:33.510> in

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
loose they are how many Springs are in

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:40.280 
loose they are how many Springs are in
the<00:03:33.990> virtual<00:03:35.210> spring<00:03:36.210> tank<00:03:36.660> so<00:03:37.440> here<00:03:39.140> this<00:03:40.140> is

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
the virtual spring tank so here this is

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.890 
the virtual spring tank so here this is
kind<00:03:40.530> of<00:03:40.650> like<00:03:40.800> a<00:03:40.860> standard<00:03:42.380> spring<00:03:44.840> kind<00:03:45.840> of

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
kind of like a standard spring kind of

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.820 
kind of like a standard spring kind of
hearing<00:03:46.110> wiggling<00:03:46.470> around<00:03:46.560> there<00:03:47.390> if<00:03:48.390> you

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
hearing wiggling around there if you

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:54.680 
hearing wiggling around there if you
change<00:03:49.830> the<00:03:49.920> tension<00:03:52.550> you<00:03:53.550> here<00:03:53.970> it's<00:03:54.540> like

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
change the tension you here it's like

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.520 
change the tension you here it's like
they're<00:03:54.810> being<00:03:54.959> stretched<00:03:57.080> so<00:03:58.080> this<00:03:58.230> is<00:03:58.260> like

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
they're being stretched so this is like

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.000 
they're being stretched so this is like
totally<00:03:58.920> stretched<00:03:59.790> out<00:04:00.120> and<00:04:01.050> then<00:04:01.740> this<00:04:01.830> is

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
totally stretched out and then this is

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.990 
totally stretched out and then this is
totally<00:04:02.490> relaxed<00:04:04.550> good<00:04:05.550> for<00:04:05.700> some<00:04:05.820> dick

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
totally relaxed good for some dick

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:15.470 
totally relaxed good for some dick
dale's<00:04:06.209> out<00:04:06.530> absolutely<00:04:08.750> yeah

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.550 

very<00:04:16.480> cool<00:04:16.750> now<00:04:16.959> there's<00:04:17.140> a<00:04:17.200> couple<00:04:17.410> other

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
very cool now there's a couple other

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.170 
very cool now there's a couple other
features<00:04:17.830> there's<00:04:18.340> a<00:04:18.370> tremolo<00:04:18.730> and<00:04:18.850> some

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
features there's a tremolo and some

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.390 
features there's a tremolo and some
compression<00:04:19.570> is<00:04:19.810> that<00:04:19.959> correct<00:04:20.170> as<00:04:20.380> well<00:04:20.560> yes

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
compression is that correct as well yes

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.210 
compression is that correct as well yes
this<00:04:21.810> the<00:04:22.810> spring<00:04:23.050> reverb<00:04:23.200> we<00:04:23.740> said<00:04:24.010> you<00:04:24.130> know

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
this the spring reverb we said you know

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.130 
this the spring reverb we said you know
a<00:04:24.250> lot<00:04:24.460> of<00:04:24.490> classic<00:04:25.000> two<00:04:25.150> vamps<00:04:25.540> that<00:04:25.990> had

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.140 
a lot of classic two vamps that had

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.060 
a lot of classic two vamps that had
spring<00:04:26.500> reverb<00:04:26.650> also<00:04:27.310> had<00:04:27.810> tremolo<00:04:28.810> and<00:04:29.080> it'd

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
spring reverb also had tremolo and it'd

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.820 
spring reverb also had tremolo and it'd
be<00:04:30.100> nice<00:04:30.940> to<00:04:30.970> be<00:04:31.270> able<00:04:31.330> to<00:04:31.510> just<00:04:31.660> have<00:04:31.870> that<00:04:32.230> set

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
be nice to be able to just have that set

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.730 
be nice to be able to just have that set
of<00:04:33.010> effects<00:04:33.340> in<00:04:33.610> a<00:04:33.790> stomp<00:04:34.030> box<00:04:34.270> so<00:04:34.900> the<00:04:35.470> spring

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
of effects in a stomp box so the spring

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.030 
of effects in a stomp box so the spring
reverb<00:04:35.890> effect<00:04:36.370> in<00:04:37.120> space<00:04:37.860> also<00:04:38.860> has<00:04:39.010> a

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
reverb effect in space also has a

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.480 
reverb effect in space also has a
tremolo<00:04:39.490> which<00:04:39.700> you<00:04:39.850> can<00:04:39.970> adjust<00:04:40.060> the<00:04:41.490> depth

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
tremolo which you can adjust the depth

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:53.640 
tremolo which you can adjust the depth
and<00:04:42.730> the<00:04:42.820> and<00:04:43.210> the<00:04:43.360> speed<00:04:43.630> of<00:04:52.350> so<00:04:53.350> that's

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
and the and the speed of so that's

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.250 
and the and the speed of so that's
that's<00:04:53.920> your<00:04:54.220> classic<00:04:54.660> tube<00:04:55.660> amp<00:04:55.870> effects

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
that's your classic tube amp effects

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.620 
that's your classic tube amp effects
block<00:04:56.500> in<00:04:56.770> a<00:04:56.890> snob<00:04:57.160> box<00:04:57.370> well<00:04:57.940> there's<00:04:58.210> a<00:04:58.270> lot

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
block in a snob box well there's a lot

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.450 
block in a snob box well there's a lot
more<00:04:58.690> in<00:04:59.020> this<00:04:59.140> pedal<00:04:59.560> that<00:04:59.770> we<00:04:59.890> probably

more in this pedal that we probably

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.400 
more in this pedal that we probably
could<00:05:00.790> not<00:05:01.000> get<00:05:01.270> to<00:05:01.450> if<00:05:01.570> we<00:05:01.690> did<00:05:01.870> three<00:05:02.140> times

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
could not get to if we did three times

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.440 
could not get to if we did three times
the<00:05:02.920> length<00:05:03.070> of<00:05:03.220> this<00:05:03.340> interview<00:05:03.640> so<00:05:04.150> where
