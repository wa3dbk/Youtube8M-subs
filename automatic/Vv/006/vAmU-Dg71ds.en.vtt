00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
right here to use be a little titty

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.540 
right here to use be a little titty
sticking<00:04:55.120> out<00:04:55.240> and<00:04:55.830> I<00:04:56.830> should<00:04:57.100> I<00:04:57.160> cut<00:04:57.370> that<00:04:57.490> off

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
sticking out and I should I cut that off

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:58.940 
sticking out and I should I cut that off
and<00:04:57.910> shade<00:04:58.120> that<00:04:58.300> made<00:04:58.539> it<00:04:58.600> look<00:04:58.660> like<00:04:58.720> that

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
and shade that made it look like that

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.050 
and shade that made it look like that
this<00:04:59.950> is<00:05:00.130> what<00:05:00.280> it<00:05:00.370> actually<00:05:00.400> looked<00:05:00.910> like

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
this is what it actually looked like

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.450 
this is what it actually looked like
before<00:05:02.160> this<00:05:03.160> engine<00:05:03.580> here<00:05:04.500> this<00:05:05.500> thing<00:05:06.220> here

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
before this engine here this thing here

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.719 
before this engine here this thing here
we<00:05:07.120> cut<00:05:07.360> that<00:05:07.510> off<00:05:07.750> and<00:05:08.220> that's<00:05:09.220> that's<00:05:09.669> the

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:09.729 
we cut that off and that's that's the

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:12.600 
we cut that off and that's that's the
same<00:05:09.910> engine<00:05:10.919> so<00:05:11.919> it<00:05:12.010> makes<00:05:12.160> it<00:05:12.250> look<00:05:12.400> a<00:05:12.460> little

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
same engine so it makes it look a little

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.969 
same engine so it makes it look a little
better<00:05:12.789> and<00:05:13.140> it<00:05:14.140> might<00:05:14.289> finish<00:05:14.620> this<00:05:14.740> latch

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979 
better and it might finish this latch

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:17.670 
better and it might finish this latch
out<00:05:15.450> just<00:05:16.450> short<00:05:16.960> your<00:05:17.110> latch<00:05:17.229> out<00:05:17.440> Mike

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
out just short your latch out Mike

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.920 
out just short your latch out Mike
finally<00:05:18.190> did<00:05:18.550> let<00:05:18.729> me<00:05:18.789> say<00:05:19.120> me<00:05:19.330> he's<00:05:19.690> going<00:05:19.870> to

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
finally did let me say me he's going to

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.680 
finally did let me say me he's going to
simulate<00:05:20.169> the<00:05:20.560> engine<00:05:20.889> running<00:05:21.250> right<00:05:21.729> well

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
simulate the engine running right well

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
simulate the engine running right well
go<00:05:22.810> ahead<00:05:22.840> let<00:05:23.080> me<00:05:23.139> go<00:05:23.229> over<00:05:23.350> here<00:05:23.470> and<00:05:23.530> show

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710

go ahead let me go over here and show
them<00:05:23.919> it's<00:05:24.430> been<00:05:24.550> in<00:05:24.700> spin<00:05:24.880> the<00:05:24.970> wheel<00:05:25.150> and

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
them it's been in spin the wheel and

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.529

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:30.850 
he has it hooked up here and you'll see

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.960 
he has it hooked up here and you'll see
this<00:05:31.150> actuator<00:05:31.870> lifts<00:05:32.200> up<00:05:32.380> I<00:05:32.729> hate<00:05:33.729> trying

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
this actuator lifts up I hate trying

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:40.620 
this actuator lifts up I hate trying
spent<00:05:34.300> oh<00:05:34.450> yeah<00:05:38.370> hey<00:05:39.370> movement<00:05:40.300> there<00:05:40.479> yeah

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
spent oh yeah hey movement there yeah

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.640 
spent oh yeah hey movement there yeah
yes<00:05:40.960> let's<00:05:41.229> go<00:05:41.550> okay<00:05:42.550> spare<00:05:43.000> yeah<00:05:43.660> he's<00:05:44.500> not

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
that the little mechanism there oops I

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:01.550 
that the little mechanism there oops I
with<00:05:56.650> that<00:05:56.940> come<00:05:57.940> on<00:05:58.000> a<00:05:58.030> little<00:05:58.150> slow

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.020 

so<00:06:02.560> that's<00:06:02.740> gonna<00:06:02.920> Ramos<00:06:03.340> pretty<00:06:03.700> pretty

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.030 
so that's gonna Ramos pretty pretty

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.600 
so that's gonna Ramos pretty pretty
freely<00:06:04.270> but<00:06:04.720> it's<00:06:05.050> not<00:06:05.320> it's<00:06:05.590> tight<00:06:05.860> yeah<00:06:06.190> not

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
freely but it's not it's tight yeah not

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.050 
freely but it's not it's tight yeah not
a<00:06:06.640> lot<00:06:06.790> of<00:06:06.850> sloppy<00:06:08.370> and<00:06:09.370> when<00:06:09.490> them<00:06:09.610> balls<00:06:09.850> go

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.060 
a lot of sloppy and when them balls go

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.600 
a lot of sloppy and when them balls go
out<00:06:10.240> that's<00:06:10.480> going<00:06:10.630> to<00:06:10.720> actually<00:06:11.110> hold<00:06:11.260> out

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610 
out that's going to actually hold out

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:14.220 
out that's going to actually hold out
that<00:06:12.610> latch<00:06:12.880> which<00:06:13.420> I'll<00:06:13.570> hold<00:06:13.750> open<00:06:13.960> is

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:14.230
