00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.979
 very good we all have one more day with 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.779
 all of us and very clear of something 

00:00:04.979 --> 00:00:08.820
 considerably important 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.559
 a few days ago a video how 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.160
 customize the websites do not change the 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.780
 recommended sites of the game and we use 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.939
 an external tool a little bit is in 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.619
 the game that was the enigma tool and 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.529
 with that we customize the wild 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.150
 for different champions well rivers not 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.830
 you know that you have seen my video or something 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.599
 but he has inserted what is coming if not 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.369
 is tool within the game itself 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.830
 and several tests are being done in the 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.180
 pv server testing server and it's what 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.740
 that we are going to talk today not about this 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.680
 tool that is going to be inserted as 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.060
 in the game until this works 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.740
 correctly and exit the server 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.840
 official then we can continue to use 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.150
 the tool in the previous video that 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.620
 I have uploaded to the channel you can go if you do not 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.390
 you have seen and see how to customize 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.100
 our our 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.920
 wills until this is totally 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.420
 official and work properly but 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.980
 well let's show it how we can see 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.410
 our profile have removed the tab 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.330
 of achievements that has never been used is 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.040
 introduced from the beginning but never 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.190
 there have been achievements in vigo players has not 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.780
 had too much use 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.670
 and it has been replaced by the tab 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.220
 objects that this is what we are going to 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.900
 talk about one we go into this tab 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.030
 what we are going to see is like a small 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.530
 store on the left side that 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.479
 It works exactly like the store 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.960
 has a search engine where we can search 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:21.880
 objects we can filter by type of 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.560
 objects and function exactly like 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.570
 the store that we currently have league 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.369
 of legends and to create our web 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.399
 personalized is simply something 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.450
 similar to master pages 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:33.430
 we can create mastery pages 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.770
 giving you click here they were good more we give 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.390
 here pipe and we create weeks pages by 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.880
 so to say it in this name is invented 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.530
 no page from which we created 5 se 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.110
 extreme in the first and the pencil then 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.060
 we can change the name we put with 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.710
 paper mit for example 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.360
 and what we have to do is click 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.610
 to create a new block that this 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.740
 would be the current blocks that we have 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.409
 for the store as it could be objects 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.759
 offensive objects from defensive and 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.150
 something of that simply that we can 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.220
 put the systems 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.140
 early game for example the objects of 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.820
 start of game we can not put in 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.009
 Spanish obviously as if we want 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.270
 put you're a repo banks what 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.980
 we can put without any kind of 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.560
 problem is simply something for 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.350
 we know what the story is about and 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:21.340
 well something standard something that works in 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.660
 some champions then some boots and three 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:28.090
 positions we simply create a new 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:29.740
 block items beat game in the middle of 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.320
 the game not when we do the first 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.709
 back and all that the first base round 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:38.560
 Well what we can put for example 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.830
 one hour old is to improve the boots 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.160
 obviously h 0 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:47.100
 and so a rule and for example by 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:51.300
 put something and then objects to beat 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.830
 game and tense items let game for final 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.990
 of the game, obviously we will have 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.390
 to have a rocket a correct one for 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.620
 do enough damage a vacuum cane 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.630
 in case they have enough resistance 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.370
 magic and an archangel's cane by the 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.620
 Manna theme if it's a mana champion and 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.880
 so this is something genetic like we have 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.980
 have a little head in doing 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.319
 this and know what characters we are going to 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.749
 use it 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.849
 we can also use it in another way 

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:15.569
 simply because we can put versus 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.099
 leblanc 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.989
 leblanc is a champion who has 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:21.659
 a lot of magic damage especially at the level 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.060
 6 for you hit the combo and well then 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:26.420
 seeing this, we can put 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.769
 example against it as resistance 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.599
 magic would be best to prevent 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.889
 they do us a lot of damage very little time 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:34.049
 and here we can customize it as 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:37.319
 we want once we have more or less 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:39.180
 our website we are simply going to save 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:42.209
 and we would see that we have it saved 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.519
 as will and we just need to enter 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.260
 to the game and see that everything works 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.090
 correctly and we can use then 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.510
 this web personalized so to speak 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.519
 inside the game so now we're going to 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.430
 see if all this works correctly 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:59.230
 and how can we select it in the game 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.790
 come some things that surely 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.920
 many of you will pass with this from 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.780
 the very personalized is that as it has 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.189
 happened to me also I will not deny is 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.500
 say once we have it as the 

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:10.359
 we select because we have it without 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.890
 selection of champion because we can not 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:13.930
 select in any way and it 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.340
 select within the game since 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.570
 we are in the game that we can see 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.479
 Well, we go to the store as 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.220
 we usually do and simply 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:23.080
 We have the store as always with the 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.850
 objects that recommend us but yes in 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.860
 change were recommended and we click 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.740
 here on the little arrow we will see that we 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.020
 the pages that we have created come out 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.669
 previously in the profile and we have the 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.979
 pile for me to have we believe that to 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:38.650
 we here have what we have 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:40.660
 created and temperley game and 3,000 game 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.940
 led items and here good we could 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.099
 keep putting things for example as 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.110
 what we have and initial subjects 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:49.900
 offensive essentials we can put 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.520
 as many things as we want yes and for 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.020
 our understanding of simply 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.570
 put three other things to teach from 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.210
 an easy way from here because 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.819
 we bought 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.160
 simply what I would have to look at is 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:05.009
 how to do to put the three portions 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.020
 here not that I have the symbol of three for 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:09.660
 example this and that we do not get three 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.090
 times but good I'll look at it and if this 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.680
 for a vocation or whatever 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.599
 simply here we have our guild 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.300
 of customized apemit without using any 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:20.250
 object no program external to the code 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.599
 fly ends and good when they go out in 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.889
 official for your we will make this tool 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:25.139
 and so far we will have 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:27.150
 what to make of the enigma tool 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:29.400
 that you can find in a video in my 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.590
