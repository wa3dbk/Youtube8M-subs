something

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.820 
something
I'm<00:01:40.360> basically<00:01:40.840> standing<00:01:41.350> here<00:01:41.500> because<00:01:41.650> this

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
I'm basically standing here because this

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.580 
I'm basically standing here because this
really<00:01:42.160> seems<00:01:42.520> new<00:01:42.820> to<00:01:43.030> me<00:01:43.180> the<00:01:43.930> quarter<00:01:44.260> oxen

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590

is<00:01:44.710> something<00:01:45.160> for<00:01:45.370> Dubai<00:01:45.700> care<00:01:46.060> and<00:01:46.960> I<00:01:47.320> guess

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
is something for Dubai care and I guess

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.020 
is something for Dubai care and I guess
the<00:01:47.740> only<00:01:47.860> reason<00:01:48.310> why<00:01:48.430> I<00:01:48.460> approached<00:01:48.880> this

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
the only reason why I approached this

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.540 
the only reason why I approached this
because<00:01:49.240> of<00:01:49.300> the<00:01:49.390> strings<00:01:49.890> we<00:01:50.890> are<00:01:51.040> parked<00:01:51.370> at

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
because of the strings we are parked at

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.850 
because of the strings we are parked at
but<00:01:52.210> I<00:01:52.270> mean<00:01:52.420> it<00:01:52.540> looks<00:01:52.750> like<00:01:52.960> grated<00:01:53.560> cheese

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
but I mean it looks like grated cheese

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.260 
but I mean it looks like grated cheese
into<00:01:54.160> a<00:01:54.220> cheesy<00:01:54.690> with<00:01:55.690> mozzarella<00:01:56.290> cheese<00:01:57.270> so

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
into a cheesy with mozzarella cheese so

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.360 
into a cheesy with mozzarella cheese so
I<00:01:58.330> just<00:01:58.600> ordered<00:01:58.900> my<00:01:59.020> first<00:01:59.320> drink<00:01:59.590> from
