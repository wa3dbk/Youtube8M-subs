college<00:02:06.379> I<00:02:06.590> think<00:02:07.340> they<00:02:07.459> should<00:02:07.640> have<00:02:07.670> a<00:02:07.849> more

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
college I think they should have a more

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.309 
college I think they should have a more
prep<00:02:08.300> I<00:02:08.420> think<00:02:08.599> they<00:02:08.660> should<00:02:08.810> roll<00:02:09.050> them<00:02:09.200> out

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
prep I think they should roll them out

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.740 
prep I think they should roll them out
more<00:02:09.530> broadly<00:02:09.789> and<00:02:10.789> I<00:02:10.940> think<00:02:11.150> I<00:02:11.270> think<00:02:11.629> that

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
more broadly and I think I think that

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.270 
more broadly and I think I think that
building<00:02:12.110> yeah<00:02:12.379> the<00:02:12.620> fact<00:02:12.800> that<00:02:12.920> you<00:02:13.069> have

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
building yeah the fact that you have

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.949 
building yeah the fact that you have
them<00:02:13.489> behind<00:02:13.849> the<00:02:14.090> counter<00:02:14.510> in<00:02:14.599> that<00:02:14.720> you<00:02:14.810> have

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
them behind the counter in that you have

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.660 
them behind the counter in that you have
to<00:02:15.050> be<00:02:15.170> over<00:02:15.410> 17<00:02:15.560> i<00:02:15.890> think<00:02:16.160> is<00:02:16.250> completely

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
to be over 17 i think is completely

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:17.890 
to be over 17 i think is completely
ludicrous<00:02:16.819> i<00:02:17.180> think<00:02:17.360> that<00:02:17.510> this<00:02:17.660> should<00:02:17.840> be

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
ludicrous i think that this should be

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.039 
ludicrous i think that this should be
the<00:02:17.989> future<00:02:18.939> okay<00:02:19.939> i<00:02:19.969> can<00:02:20.239> at<00:02:20.390> least<00:02:20.510> disagree

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049 
the future okay i can at least disagree

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:22.010 
the future okay i can at least disagree
with<00:02:21.200> that<00:02:21.230> we<00:02:21.709> can't

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020

17 before you could buy that I mean what

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.520
