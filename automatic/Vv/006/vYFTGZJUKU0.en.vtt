00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 good guys now let's see the new 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:09.330
 trailer of black ops 2 I've seen it 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.610
 it really is disappointing nothing more 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.160
 He taught it to you and nothing more finished what 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.260
 we comment and good guys so you can see 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.670
 really that it's not worth seeing this 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.810
 trailer because it's the same and good now 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.020
 I leave you with the trailer 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.450
 you think 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:31.500
 and you really tell me what has 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:33.090
 similar to giving you likes if you want but 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.040
 because it really is that it does not deserve 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.200
 I still leave you with this 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.030
 trailer 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.330
 I really hope you like it and if not 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:46.520
 well, really nothing has changed 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.520
 good guys here I leave you 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.770
 joint 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:06.190
 of miami and chamomile more 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.190
 the patients choose the sky 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.020
 goodbye 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.609
 the essence 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.609
 for sandra the list 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.600
 very good people youtube shakira 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.160
 presents commenting and how did you just see 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.230
 we have seen the new trailer 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.260
 supposedly from call of duty black ops 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.720
 2 the one they were going to give at the end of the 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:31.200
 champions league as you just saw 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:35.620
 it's really the same as the 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.780
 official trailer of the black ops 2 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.280
 the first one they got the same as medal 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.320
 of honor that we will now talk about 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.510
 megalujo us but really the carl 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.700
 bildt and black ops 2 just us 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.890
 disappoint everyone because they have done what 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.790
 they have made a copy and paste to 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:54.790
 watch a 30 second trailer in which 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:58.520
 you only see new things like as per 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:02.299
 example from minute 6 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:07.520
 9 minute really look like buildings 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:10.129
 let's not say mini buildings type movies 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.440
 beautiful a future quite distant as 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:15.200
 I say and nothing else 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.660
 new four-helix helicopters 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.980
 that I remember his name and one thing that 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.739
 yes, it strikes me that if in the 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:25.310
 minute 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:30.790
 I think from minute 10 and 1 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.790
 2020 minute can be seen as 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.230
 at 20 seconds that is what lasts 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:40.160
 trailer almost almost lasting 30 can be 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.080
 see how it's going to be a kind of ship in 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.060
 which you shoot projectiles that this 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.050
 It reminds me a lot of metal gear solid 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.050
 when you were riding on it 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.610
 dinosaur rex the t-rex 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:57.670
 rex and I do not remember if rex is really 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.740
 nothing nothing new just this good too 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.260
 three people two characters one kind 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:05.350
 of morenito with a beard and another that does not 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:09.010
 he really did not get to identify and woods 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:11.380
 that we can already have really confirmed 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:15.700
 who is still alive after call of duty 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:18.670
 black one in which woods that I wanted 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.800
 annihilate one if I am one hundred 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.520
 memory annihilate one but to save 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.330
 to me they are and it really explodes not but 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.970
 after the explosion is some 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.550
 kind of black shadow of a character 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:34.270
 and it turns out that it's woods still alive is 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:37.090
 I suppose we will control woods 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.100
 really for what I'm seeing since 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.010
 As it comes out, old souvenir goes for 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.350
 do not bundle the part as in the first 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.260
 trailer what to remember now as 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.840
 black ops one will remember the past and 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.910
 well really the weapons that come out 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:58.850
 they come out in butterfield 3 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:04:02.720
 ok bad company 2 as the 870 ms ms the 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:06.620
 and others more like the 94 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:08.240
 and xm 8 and many more that come out 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.310
 battlefield bad company 2 as I have already 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.490
 repeated and I'm really going to give a 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.830
 logical enough opinion to say 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.230
 I 'm talking about a game that 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.359
 just passed from the cold war as 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.490
 we say to a very very future 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:25.100
 far away that really by a lot 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.680
 advance technology this future is not 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.710
 at our reach we live in a future 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.310
 of type modern warfare 3 not as I have already 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:36.950
 said many times modern warfare 3 is 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:40.490
 let's say that nowadays nothing 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:45.900
 more to say but bad company black ops 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:49.740
 2 we talk about a future that really is 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:52.919
 this of carrying ching robots without people 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.300
 and everything just really is very very very 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:56.430
 very crazy crazy 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.979
 I do not know if they will attract the public 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.479
 I hope so and nothing guys really 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:03.300
 As you can see we have been disappointed 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:05.070
 a lot with the trailer and the only thing that I owe 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.930
 say it of 'medal of honor' that also 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.580
 has removed the trailer is the same as the 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.530
 first trailer that they took out in medal of 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.199
 honor the only one that changes is the end 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.039
 that is when you see that you can what 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:16.530
 It can 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:18.360
 what is achieved by reserving the game and 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.910
 nothing really what you think of this game 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.800
 that you think they have done well to mock 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.270
 in trolling us as they said a lot 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.979
 people from us after a 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.350
 incredible final the champions league 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:31.600
 you think we really deserved this 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:35.800
 You really can not have a mini 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:39.160
 a mini scene or something from the online or something 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:42.580
 new because according to informed me I do not know if 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:44.560
 it's true or there's not a demo really not 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.990
 I know if it 's official or only for people 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:50.340
 let's say entrepreneurs and all these people 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:53.860
 important of two online maps really 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:55.660
 I think in white fans that all 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.020
 we do not deserve this so good 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.849
 I do not know what you think 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.169
 leave your comments to take away the 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:04.129
 xbox and see you in next episode 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:04.129
 goodbye
