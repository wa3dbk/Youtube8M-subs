foundation<00:03:58.669> or<00:03:58.760> concealer<00:03:58.849> in<00:03:59.359> I<00:04:04.480> mean<00:04:05.480> it's

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:05.629 
foundation or concealer in I mean it's

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:07.929 
foundation or concealer in I mean it's
really<00:04:06.079> fast<00:04:06.349> and<00:04:06.560> easy<00:04:06.739> to<00:04:07.010> use<00:04:07.040> this<00:04:07.459> thing<00:04:07.730> I
