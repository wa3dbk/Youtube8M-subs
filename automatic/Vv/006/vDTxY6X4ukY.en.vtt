 "There is no return home" - Thomas Wolfe wrote ... Well, here I am, back ... 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:32.250
 This is Chloe, who I remember: she laughs, smiles ... Now she's not like that. 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.020
 Joyce is still working in the Two Whales dining room. The best burgers in the whole Arcadia. Hurry to try them. 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.420
 The last time I was here 5 years ago. It feels like an entire eternity has passed. 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.670
 Brr ... It feels like autumn is replacing summer. 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.900
 Chloe and I spent most of this day on this drawing. Now it is almost not visible. 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.500
 And I remember this spot. Chloe and I knocked over a bottle of Joyce wine 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.220
 long rubbed, but it never got away. We then so flew ... 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.300
 The tools I need should be here. 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.200
 Heck! Here I am a slob ... 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:13.420
 Kate Marsh ... Why does he need her photos? So, this is VERY strange! .. 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.800
 These are too big. I need little tools for that camera. 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:41.600
 What? .. Stepfather Chloe installed surveillance cameras? Seriously?! 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.470
 He has obvious trust issues. Did Chloe and Joyce know this at all? 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:08.120
 Precision screwdrivers. Only I can not get them. 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.170
 Brilliant, stupid. 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.650
 Damn, you had to do it BEFORE they fell. 

00:04:35.025 --> 00:04:41.100
