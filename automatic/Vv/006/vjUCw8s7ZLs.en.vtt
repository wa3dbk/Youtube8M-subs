right then here we are a neglected

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:09.070 
right then here we are a neglected
property<00:00:07.040> and<00:00:07.549> it's<00:00:07.669> got<00:00:07.819> dry<00:00:08.059> rot<00:00:08.299> brick<00:00:08.750> and

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:09.080 
property and it's got dry rot brick and

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.320 
property and it's got dry rot brick and
I<00:00:09.980> just<00:00:10.280> wanted<00:00:10.490> to<00:00:10.580> show<00:00:10.760> you<00:00:10.820> a<00:00:10.910> couple<00:00:11.270> of

I just wanted to show you a couple of
things<00:00:11.389> a<00:00:11.840> week<00:00:12.559> in<00:00:12.740> the<00:00:12.830> car<00:00:13.039> that's<00:00:13.459> causing

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:13.789 
things a week in the car that's causing

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:16.060 
things a week in the car that's causing
it<00:00:14.090> and<00:00:14.350> saying<00:00:15.350> that<00:00:15.500> little<00:00:15.740> most<00:00:15.859> of<00:00:15.980> this

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
it and saying that little most of this

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.710 
it and saying that little most of this
dry<00:00:16.279> rot<00:00:16.490> so<00:00:16.609> ancient<00:00:16.940> history<00:00:17.270> it's<00:00:17.390> happened

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
dry rot so ancient history it's happened

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.710 
dry rot so ancient history it's happened
previously<00:00:18.940> there's<00:00:19.940> a<00:00:20.000> lot<00:00:20.120> of<00:00:20.210> stains<00:00:20.450> on

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
previously there's a lot of stains on

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.320 
previously there's a lot of stains on
the<00:00:20.840> walls<00:00:21.080> and<00:00:21.620> upstairs<00:00:22.100> as<00:00:22.280> well<00:00:22.310> and<00:00:23.060> clear

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
the walls and upstairs as well and clear

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.029 
the walls and upstairs as well and clear
the<00:00:23.510> properties<00:00:23.930> either<00:00:24.050> plumbing<00:00:24.500> leak<00:00:24.710> or<00:00:24.950> a

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
the properties either plumbing leak or a

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:27.510 
the properties either plumbing leak or a
burst<00:00:25.250> pipe<00:00:25.369> or<00:00:25.789> something<00:00:25.820> years<00:00:26.450> ago<00:00:26.750> and

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.520 
burst pipe or something years ago and

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.830 
burst pipe or something years ago and
but<00:00:28.520> we've<00:00:28.640> got<00:00:28.730> a<00:00:28.760> leak<00:00:28.970> again<00:00:29.240> now<00:00:29.420> so<00:00:29.480> that

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
but we've got a leak again now so that

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.689 
but we've got a leak again now so that
all<00:00:29.990> will<00:00:30.199> get<00:00:30.530> things<00:00:30.740> going<00:00:31.130> very<00:00:31.400> quickly

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:31.699 
all will get things going very quickly

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.750 
all will get things going very quickly
and<00:00:32.570> now<00:00:33.050> if<00:00:33.140> we're<00:00:33.289> lucky<00:00:33.379> you<00:00:33.739> can<00:00:33.949> see<00:00:34.160> the

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
and now if we're lucky you can see the

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.849 
and now if we're lucky you can see the
cuboidal<00:00:35.239> cracking<00:00:35.839> which<00:00:36.499> you<00:00:36.649> get

00:00:36.849 --> 00:00:36.859 
cuboidal cracking which you get

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:39.029 
cuboidal cracking which you get
difficulty<00:00:37.579> vital<00:00:37.999> cracking<00:00:38.420> where<00:00:38.600> the

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:46.729 
of dry appearance and here I'll just

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:49.180 
of dry appearance and here I'll just
pulled<00:00:46.969> out<00:00:47.149> some<00:00:47.449> my<00:00:48.229> ceiling<00:00:48.710> may<00:00:48.889> look<00:00:49.039> like

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
pulled out some my ceiling may look like

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.059 
pulled out some my ceiling may look like
twigs<00:00:49.579> but<00:00:49.819> actually<00:00:50.120> what<00:00:50.269> this<00:00:50.449> is<00:00:50.629> is<00:00:50.780> the

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:51.069 
twigs but actually what this is is the

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:53.919 
twigs but actually what this is is the
this<00:00:52.069> is<00:00:52.159> the<00:00:52.280> actual<00:00:52.489> mycelium<00:00:53.389> grow<00:00:53.629> up<00:00:53.690> its

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:53.929 
this is the actual mycelium grow up its

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:56.169 
this is the actual mycelium grow up its
form<00:00:54.199> some<00:00:54.440> strands<00:00:54.859> and<00:00:55.190> if<00:00:55.879> you<00:00:55.999> listen

00:00:56.169 --> 00:00:56.179 
form some strands and if you listen

00:00:56.179 --> 00:01:01.319 
form some strands and if you listen
carefully

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.240 

oops<00:01:02.329> that<00:01:02.569> one<00:01:02.809> didn't<00:01:03.049> do<00:01:03.469> as<00:01:03.589> well<00:01:03.799> here<00:01:04.100> we

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
oops that one didn't do as well here we

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.480 
oops that one didn't do as well here we
are<00:01:06.880> it's<00:01:07.880> very<00:01:08.240> brittle<00:01:09.219> that's<00:01:10.219> because

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
are it's very brittle that's because

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.999 
are it's very brittle that's because
it's<00:01:10.670> dry<00:01:11.000> and<00:01:11.560> it's<00:01:12.560> a<00:01:12.680> good<00:01:12.799> way<00:01:12.979> of

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
it's dry and it's a good way of

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:14.709 
it's dry and it's a good way of
differentiating<00:01:13.399> between<00:01:13.880> wet<00:01:14.299> rock<00:01:14.479> high

dry rocks come through the wall and

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.469 
dry rocks come through the wall and
cause<00:02:06.920> severe<00:02:07.340> decay<00:02:07.759> in<00:02:07.909> the<00:02:08.030> ends<00:02:08.240> of<00:02:08.330> these

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
plumbing leak at the moment but I don't

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.410 
plumbing leak at the moment but I don't
