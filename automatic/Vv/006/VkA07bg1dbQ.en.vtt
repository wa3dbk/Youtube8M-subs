being a biomedical engineer and the
reason<00:01:33.110> that<00:01:33.140> I<00:01:33.259> chose<00:01:33.590> RCHS<00:01:34.580> was<00:01:34.849> because<00:01:35.179> it

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
reason that I chose RCHS was because it

the tech tines award means so much and
has<00:01:49.520> done<00:01:49.910> so<00:01:49.940> much<00:01:50.239> for<00:01:50.450> the<00:01:50.509> high<00:01:50.629> school<00:01:50.869> and

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
has done so much for the high school and

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.300 
has done so much for the high school and
that<00:01:51.200> it<00:01:52.000> confirms<00:01:53.000> our<00:01:54.009> presence<00:01:55.009> on<00:01:55.190> the

college campus as well in the community

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.680 
college campus as well in the community
well<00:01:57.619> I<00:01:57.649> think<00:01:57.800> what<00:01:58.129> makes<00:01:58.310> it<00:01:58.580> so<00:01:58.849> unique<00:01:58.879> is

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
two years that it's been established the

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.839 
two years that it's been established the
fact<00:02:15.110> that<00:02:15.260> we<00:02:15.410> won<00:02:15.620> the<00:02:15.860> tech<00:02:16.430> Titan<00:02:16.730> awards

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
fact that we won the tech Titan awards

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.670 
fact that we won the tech Titan awards
shows<00:02:17.300> that<00:02:17.450> we<00:02:17.599> have<00:02:17.780> great<00:02:18.200> engineering

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
shows that we have great engineering

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.430 
shows that we have great engineering
classes<00:02:18.980> and<00:02:19.489> it<00:02:20.480> were<00:02:20.629> better<00:02:20.840> prepared<00:02:21.019> all

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440

transfer<00:02:23.020> to<00:02:23.230> a<00:02:23.260> university<00:02:23.470> I<00:02:24.220> think<00:02:24.880> that's

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
transfer to a university I think that's

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.030

pretty<00:02:25.240> incredible<00:02:25.680> especially<00:02:26.680> since<00:02:26.830> it's

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
pretty incredible especially since it's

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.670 
pretty incredible especially since it's
the<00:02:27.220> second<00:02:28.000> year<00:02:28.030> that<00:02:28.450> rich<00:02:29.260> in<00:02:29.380> collegiate

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
the second year that rich in collegiate

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.870 
the second year that rich in collegiate
high<00:02:29.770> school<00:02:30.010> has<00:02:30.130> been<00:02:30.160> going<00:02:30.490> on<00:02:30.610> that<00:02:30.850> just
