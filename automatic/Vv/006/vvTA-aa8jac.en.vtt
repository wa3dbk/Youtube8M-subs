the sort of winning school at the
ballpark<00:00:55.100> ranges<00:00:55.910> right<00:00:56.210> now<00:00:56.450> I'd<00:00:56.660> say<00:00:56.870> it's

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
ballpark ranges right now I'd say it's

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.319 
ballpark ranges right now I'd say it's
probably<00:00:57.110> upwards<00:00:57.380> of<00:00:57.680> 30,000<00:00:58.579> so<00:00:59.120> what<00:00:59.239> I'm

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
probably upwards of 30,000 so what I'm

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:00.610 
probably upwards of 30,000 so what I'm
going<00:00:59.480> to<00:00:59.540> do<00:00:59.660> is<00:00:59.780> try<00:00:59.899> and<00:00:59.989> give<00:01:00.230> you<00:01:00.260> guys<00:01:00.590> a

twenty<00:02:36.170> thousand<00:02:36.530> seven<00:02:36.740> hundred<00:02:36.770> which<00:02:37.100> I

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
twenty thousand seven hundred which I

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.620 
twenty thousand seven hundred which I
don't<00:02:37.310> think<00:02:37.580> will<00:02:37.670> be<00:02:37.760> too<00:02:37.940> hard<00:02:38.180> as<00:02:38.390> you<00:02:38.540> can

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
don't think will be too hard as you can

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.390 
don't think will be too hard as you can
see<00:02:38.810> there's<00:02:38.930> quite<00:02:38.960> a<00:02:39.140> few<00:02:39.200> mistakes<00:02:39.500> in<00:02:40.340> my

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
see there's quite a few mistakes in my

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.140 
see there's quite a few mistakes in my
little<00:02:40.820> bit<00:02:40.910> of<00:02:41.000> gameplay<00:02:41.330> there<00:02:42.310> and<00:02:43.310> then

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
little bit of gameplay there and then

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.360 
little bit of gameplay there and then
you're<00:02:44.450> just<00:02:44.510> competing<00:02:45.170> amongst<00:02:45.830> each<00:02:46.160> other

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
you're just competing amongst each other

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.130 
you're just competing amongst each other
I<00:02:46.520> imagine<00:02:46.940> there'll<00:02:47.180> be<00:02:47.210> much<00:02:47.480> greater

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
I imagine there'll be much greater

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.670 
I imagine there'll be much greater
chance<00:02:48.350> of<00:02:48.740> actually<00:02:48.890> winning<00:02:49.280> this<00:02:49.610> one<00:02:50.680> the

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
chance of actually winning this one the

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.340 
chance of actually winning this one the
the<00:02:51.920> overkill<00:02:52.340> competition<00:02:53.000> so<00:02:53.660> get<00:02:54.320> out

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
the overkill competition so get out

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.200

there guys give the flash game ago it is
a<00:02:56.270> load<00:02:56.540> of<00:02:56.690> fun<00:02:56.810> it's<00:02:56.990> gonna<00:02:57.050> take<00:02:57.260> a<00:02:57.290> little

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
a load of fun it's gonna take a little

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.710 
a load of fun it's gonna take a little
bit<00:02:57.590> of<00:02:57.650> practice<00:02:58.070> as<00:02:58.220> I<00:02:58.400> said<00:02:58.730> things<00:02:59.330> have<00:02:59.570> to

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
bit of practice as I said things have to

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.600 
bit of practice as I said things have to
fall<00:02:59.750> in<00:02:59.930> place<00:03:00.170> VZ<00:03:00.650> at<00:03:00.770> those<00:03:00.920> higher<00:03:01.160> scores

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
fall in place VZ at those higher scores

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.820 
fall in place VZ at those higher scores
and<00:03:01.820> just<00:03:02.390> try<00:03:03.020> and<00:03:03.080> keep<00:03:03.230> your<00:03:03.440> nerve<00:03:03.590> because

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
and just try and keep your nerve because

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.190 
and just try and keep your nerve because
you<00:03:04.100> can<00:03:04.250> survive<00:03:04.550> on<00:03:04.610> 56<00:03:05.450> seconds<00:03:05.780> for<00:03:05.960> a<00:03:05.990> very

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
you can survive on 56 seconds for a very

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.900 
you can survive on 56 seconds for a very
long<00:03:06.380> time<00:03:06.440> as<00:03:06.830> long<00:03:06.950> as<00:03:07.040> you<00:03:07.130> keep<00:03:07.400> hitting

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
long time as long as you keep hitting

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.050 
long time as long as you keep hitting
targets<00:03:08.740> consistently<00:03:09.740> so<00:03:10.010> as<00:03:10.250> I<00:03:10.760> said<00:03:10.820> only

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
targets consistently so as I said only

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.040 
targets consistently so as I said only
have<00:03:11.180> to<00:03:11.240> do<00:03:11.300> is<00:03:11.360> comment<00:03:11.540> this<00:03:11.660> video<00:03:11.780> that
