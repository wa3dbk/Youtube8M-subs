00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.660
 hello everyone guys xvi is talking 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:10.950
 this will be say not really one 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:14.420
 guide but a video summary of the 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.199
 diaries ability and how to 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.980
 concatenate its anyway in a way 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.980
 as effective as possible 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.300
 sa is a norm 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.300
 however, nothing too demanding is not 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.500
 This purpose of the video is not 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.710
 to show a challenging part 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.130
 simply the skills of yesterday and how 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.130
 I have already said how to use them 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.130
 correct 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:46.289
 I have to against a nice cross med championa 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.390
 represents a favorable matchup for me 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.170
 because there is very little plan 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.850
 mobile 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.559
 on the contrary diaries that it is really a lot 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:58.140
 very mobile at 3 by three jumps in a 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:03.180
 match pretty easy for me and scored 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:06.799
 the first trade here also towards pro la 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.799
 my real strength of a 6-man 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.720
 right now the is about to happen 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.950
 before the match with an ace of 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.420
 dinner 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.340
 let's see some damage exchanges in 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.550
 our pantheon dies 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.820
 now lisin comes under tower in 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.220
 precise moment in which I understand that it is 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:34.800
 to take a thorne shot he took 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:39.150
 the knights we review here it is from a 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:41.960
 slow-motion too slow-motion ad 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:47.180
 be the hit of tore but look a little 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.180
 ungrateful and dies 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:55.200
 this is the first one asks in this 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.280
 time of the game we will see what 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.700
 is the basic tactic with ari reached the 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.700
 level 6 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:13.670
 we believe in myself from time to time then 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.670
 level 7 tl 6 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.920
 This is the tactic ras ok now 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.050
 let's say let's say two thirds more life o 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:27.000
 less from this point on I can go 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.480
 hills we see is richard and then around 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.530
 around 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:34.380
 no jump to the right or left me not 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:41.239
 has removed practically nothing 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:41.239
 I had a spit j 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.400
 now we will make you a wade clearly 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.599
 very quietly to acquire 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.599
 even more advantage 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.640
 no 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.010
 no 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:28.679
 Yes No 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:23.270
 guys thanks to all the vision of 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:26.000
 finish I remind you of the key points belgium 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:27.710
 caleari that is to charm because 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.889
 subsequent damage is amplified 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:33.080
 hit the q if possible kill the 

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:36.080
 maximum trend for a sea ​​to be 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:39.889
 to the outward journey that does more damage on the return e 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:42.139
 the mid trade or level 6 look for 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:43.820
 pocar ​​is under two thirds of life then 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:45.950
 going a link with the opponent does not 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:48.470
 find the minions behind otherwise fail 

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:50.240
 sketches up thanks to all of the 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:53.000
 vision always liked the video not 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:55.720
 forget to share bye 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.720
