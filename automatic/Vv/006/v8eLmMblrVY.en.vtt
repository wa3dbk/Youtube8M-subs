00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
that it's really strong so felting is

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.660

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
agitating in a machine you can also do

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.300 
agitating in a machine you can also do
needle<00:01:40.290> felting<00:01:40.590> which<00:01:40.710> allows<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.159> add
