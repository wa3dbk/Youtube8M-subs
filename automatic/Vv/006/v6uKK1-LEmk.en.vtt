00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
feel really retarded for that but I used

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.720 
feel really retarded for that but I used
to<00:02:19.510> think<00:02:19.630> it<00:02:19.810> was<00:02:19.870> this<00:02:20.170> new<00:02:20.410> message<00:02:20.800> box<00:02:21.130> up

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
to think it was this new message box up

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.430 
to think it was this new message box up
in<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:22.000> corner<00:02:22.360> and<00:02:22.450> then<00:02:22.570> you<00:02:22.690> had<00:02:22.870> to<00:02:22.900> type

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
in the corner and then you had to type

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.990 
in the corner and then you had to type
in<00:02:23.590> a<00:02:23.650> new<00:02:23.800> number<00:02:24.040> so<00:02:24.220> I<00:02:24.310> kind<00:02:24.640> of<00:02:24.670> figured<00:02:24.790> it

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
in a new number so I kind of figured it

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.260 
in a new number so I kind of figured it

video<00:02:50.590> I<00:02:50.770> made<00:02:51.070> um<00:02:52.080> so<00:02:53.080> calling<00:02:53.530> people<00:02:53.950> is<00:02:54.250> not

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
video I made um so calling people is not

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.730 
video I made um so calling people is not
the<00:02:55.090> greatest<00:02:55.390> thing<00:02:55.780> to<00:02:55.990> do<00:02:56.110> on<00:02:56.140> here<00:02:56.440> because

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
the greatest thing to do on here because

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.560 
the greatest thing to do on here because
it's<00:02:56.920> through<00:02:57.160> Wi-Fi<00:02:57.370> it<00:02:58.060> does<00:02:58.270> have<00:02:58.480> this

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
it's through Wi-Fi it does have this

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.040 
it's through Wi-Fi it does have this
little<00:02:58.780> HD<00:02:59.440> symbol<00:02:59.980> right<00:03:00.160> there<00:03:00.460> I<00:03:01.050> don't

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
little HD symbol right there I don't

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.070 
little HD symbol right there I don't
know<00:03:02.440> what<00:03:02.800> HD<00:03:03.340> means<00:03:03.700> for<00:03:04.120> a<00:03:04.150> voice<00:03:04.480> I<00:03:04.930> thought

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
know what HD means for a voice I thought

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
know what HD means for a voice I thought
HD<00:03:05.560> was<00:03:05.830> for<00:03:06.450> like<00:03:07.450> your<00:03:07.660> vision<00:03:08.050> but<00:03:08.440> I<00:03:08.710> don't

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
HD was for like your vision but I don't

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.030 
HD was for like your vision but I don't
know<00:03:09.720> I've<00:03:10.720> tried<00:03:10.930> to<00:03:11.080> call<00:03:11.290> like<00:03:11.680> for<00:03:12.010> people

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
know I've tried to call like for people

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:18.020 
know I've tried to call like for people
with<00:03:12.760> this<00:03:12.910> number<00:03:13.090> and<00:03:14.700> its<00:03:15.700> really<00:03:16.180> laggy<00:03:16.840> so

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
with this number and its really laggy so

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.490 
with this number and its really laggy so
you'll<00:03:19.030> try<00:03:19.240> to<00:03:19.270> talk<00:03:19.570> to<00:03:19.720> them<00:03:19.750> and<00:03:20.290> then

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
you'll try to talk to them and then

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.830 
you'll try to talk to them and then
you're<00:03:20.680> actually<00:03:20.830> hearing<00:03:21.310> them<00:03:21.840> shorter

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
you're actually hearing them shorter

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.150 
you're actually hearing them shorter
than<00:03:23.080> when<00:03:23.260> they<00:03:23.380> actually<00:03:23.560> said<00:03:23.980> something

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
than when they actually said something

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.800 
than when they actually said something
so<00:03:24.640> then<00:03:24.790> they<00:03:24.940> think<00:03:25.150> you<00:03:25.300> don't<00:03:25.450> hear<00:03:25.660> them

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
so then they think you don't hear them

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.110 
so then they think you don't hear them
and<00:03:25.990> then<00:03:26.080> it<00:03:26.200> gets<00:03:26.290> really<00:03:26.470> confusing<00:03:27.060> so<00:03:28.060> I

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
and then it gets really confusing so I

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.000 
and then it gets really confusing so I
don't<00:03:28.330> recommend<00:03:28.690> calling<00:03:29.170> on<00:03:29.500> this<00:03:29.680> unless

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
don't recommend calling on this unless

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.540 
don't recommend calling on this unless
it's<00:03:30.220> an<00:03:30.610> emergency<00:03:30.870> unless<00:03:31.870> you<00:03:32.020> are<00:03:32.170> really

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
it's an emergency unless you are really

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.860
