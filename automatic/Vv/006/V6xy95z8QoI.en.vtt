billion tons of iron ore and to do that

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.770 
billion tons of iron ore and to do that
they<00:02:43.959> need<00:02:44.170> to<00:02:44.200> remove<00:02:44.739> 5<00:02:45.640> billion<00:02:46.120> tons<00:02:46.450> of

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.670 
they need to remove 5 billion tons of

what kind of habitats exist out there we

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.819 
what kind of habitats exist out there we
don't<00:02:57.970> know<00:02:58.180> enough<00:02:58.510> about<00:02:58.630> how<00:02:59.049> that<00:02:59.560> fits

don't know enough about how that fits

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:01.890 
don't know enough about how that fits
into<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.220> food<00:03:00.459> web<00:03:00.880> and<00:03:00.910> what<00:03:01.630> kind<00:03:01.840> of

into the food web and what kind of

into the food web and what kind of
impacts<00:03:02.200> those<00:03:02.440> will<00:03:02.650> have<00:03:02.769> a<00:03:03.069> lot<00:03:03.459> of<00:03:03.489> its

impacts those will have a lot of its

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.780 
impacts those will have a lot of its
being<00:03:03.850> based<00:03:04.150> on<00:03:04.480> the<00:03:05.260> adaptive<00:03:05.709> management

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
being based on the adaptive management

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.190 
being based on the adaptive management
principles<00:03:06.790> which<00:03:07.060> saying<00:03:07.420> well<00:03:07.750> you're

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
principles which saying well you're

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.840 
principles which saying well you're
monitoring<00:03:08.739> and<00:03:09.010> if<00:03:09.069> we<00:03:09.250> see<00:03:09.430> that<00:03:09.579> there's<00:03:09.790> a

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
monitoring and if we see that there's a

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.849 
monitoring and if we see that there's a
problem<00:03:10.120> then<00:03:10.690> we<00:03:10.840> can<00:03:11.049> deal<00:03:11.410> with<00:03:11.440> that

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:11.859 
problem then we can deal with that

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:14.220 
problem then we can deal with that
retrospectively<00:03:12.730> but<00:03:12.940> so<00:03:13.150> to<00:03:13.209> speak<00:03:13.540> adaptive

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
retrospectively but so to speak adaptive

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.809 
retrospectively but so to speak adaptive
management<00:03:14.410> is<00:03:14.709> great<00:03:14.950> but<00:03:15.250> you<00:03:15.370> really<00:03:15.700> have

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
management is great but you really have

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:17.250 
management is great but you really have
to<00:03:15.940> understand<00:03:16.329> your<00:03:16.510> system<00:03:16.810> and<00:03:17.019> we<00:03:17.079> don't

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
to understand your system and we don't

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.470 
to understand your system and we don't
have<00:03:17.380> that<00:03:17.440> understanding<00:03:18.250> here<00:03:18.430> and<00:03:18.880> what

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
have that understanding here and what

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.559 
have that understanding here and what
will<00:03:19.630> happen<00:03:20.079> is<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.440> impact<00:03:20.950> of<00:03:21.190> these<00:03:21.569> multi

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569 
will happen is the impact of these multi

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:24.720 
will happen is the impact of these multi
billions<00:03:23.049> of<00:03:23.170> tons<00:03:23.470> of<00:03:23.709> sand<00:03:23.950> being<00:03:24.280> sucked<00:03:24.609> up

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
billions of tons of sand being sucked up

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.270 
billions of tons of sand being sucked up
by<00:03:24.790> these<00:03:25.060> machines<00:03:25.350> altered<00:03:26.350> basically<00:03:27.010> and

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
by these machines altered basically and

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.900 
by these machines altered basically and
then<00:03:27.760> put<00:03:28.030> back<00:03:28.209> into<00:03:28.630> the<00:03:28.750> sea<00:03:29.079> it<00:03:29.769> will<00:03:30.069> have

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
then put back into the sea it will have

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.910 
then put back into the sea it will have
an<00:03:31.030> impact<00:03:31.150> on<00:03:31.540> the<00:03:31.660> oxygen<00:03:32.079> content<00:03:32.470> in<00:03:32.799> the

an impact on the oxygen content in the

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.949 
an impact on the oxygen content in the
ocean<00:03:33.220> would<00:03:33.609> we<00:03:33.850> allow<00:03:34.150> that<00:03:34.209> to<00:03:34.420> happen<00:03:34.750> here

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
ocean would we allow that to happen here

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.990 
ocean would we allow that to happen here
in<00:03:35.410> our<00:03:35.560> atmosphere<00:03:36.160> to<00:03:36.190> have<00:03:36.430> somebody<00:03:36.760> come

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
in our atmosphere to have somebody come

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.379 
in our atmosphere to have somebody come
along<00:03:37.109> suck<00:03:38.109> up<00:03:38.290> all<00:03:38.440> of<00:03:38.680> our<00:03:38.859> oxygen<00:03:39.850> all<00:03:40.180> of

along suck up all of our oxygen all of

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:42.180 
along suck up all of our oxygen all of
our<00:03:40.540> atmosphere<00:03:40.750> and<00:03:41.319> then<00:03:41.769> put<00:03:42.010> it<00:03:42.100> through

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
our atmosphere and then put it through

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.890 
our atmosphere and then put it through
machine<00:03:42.579> and<00:03:42.819> then<00:03:42.910> and<00:03:43.180> then<00:03:43.299> spit<00:03:43.630> it<00:03:43.660> back

machine and then and then spit it back
out<00:03:44.170> we<00:03:45.130> would<00:03:45.250> die<00:03:45.519> and<00:03:45.940> that's<00:03:46.120> what<00:03:46.389> could

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
out we would die and that's what could

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.990 
out we would die and that's what could
happen<00:03:46.930> to<00:03:47.319> life<00:03:47.500> in<00:03:47.680> the<00:03:47.799> oceans<00:03:48.280> in<00:03:48.579> these

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
happen to life in the oceans in these

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.160 
happen to life in the oceans in these
regions<00:03:49.510> where<00:03:49.660> they're<00:03:49.780> gonna<00:03:49.930> do<00:03:50.049> the

education<00:03:53.060> is<00:03:53.269> a<00:03:53.330> great<00:03:53.629> first<00:03:54.019> step<00:03:54.140> get<00:03:54.680> to

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
education is a great first step get to

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.460 
education is a great first step get to
know<00:03:54.980> the<00:03:55.129> issues<00:03:55.330> get<00:03:56.330> to<00:03:56.480> know<00:03:56.599> what<00:03:56.900> seabed

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
know the issues get to know what seabed

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.830 
know the issues get to know what seabed
mining<00:03:57.500> is<00:03:58.040> it<00:03:58.340> might<00:03:58.549> be<00:03:58.730> coming<00:03:59.060> to<00:03:59.209> Beach
