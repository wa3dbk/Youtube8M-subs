the<00:00:13.469> target<00:00:13.950> 8<00:00:14.549> I<00:00:15.030> kind<00:00:16.020> of<00:00:16.109> reminds<00:00:16.529> me<00:00:16.560> of

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
the target 8 I kind of reminds me of

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.470 
the target 8 I kind of reminds me of
Tarzan<00:00:17.400> because<00:00:17.820> I<00:00:17.850> think<00:00:17.970> that's<00:00:18.240> how<00:00:18.449> you

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
Tarzan because I think that's how you

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.990 
Tarzan because I think that's how you
spell<00:00:18.750> Tarzan<00:00:19.350> except<00:00:20.070> it's<00:00:20.220> like<00:00:20.400> Tarzan

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
spell Tarzan except it's like Tarzan

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.929 
spell Tarzan except it's like Tarzan
eight<00:00:21.240> kind<00:00:22.050> of<00:00:22.109> thing<00:00:22.320> but<00:00:22.590> anyways<00:00:22.890> um<00:00:23.039> it<00:00:23.670> is

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
eight kind of thing but anyways um it is

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.000 
eight kind of thing but anyways um it is
an<00:00:24.150> element<00:00:24.689> of<00:00:24.869> rock<00:00:25.650> who<00:00:26.519> I<00:00:26.550> guess<00:00:27.260> it<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.590> the

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
an element of rock who I guess it is the

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.080

rock<00:00:29.369> Killa<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.840> tree<00:00:31.590> lizard<00:00:31.820> so<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:32.969> is

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
rock Killa and the tree lizard so it is

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.760 
rock Killa and the tree lizard so it is
an<00:00:33.390> element<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:34.050> Earth<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:35.930> plant<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.350> just

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
an element of Earth and plant so just

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.319 
an element of Earth and plant so just
letting<00:00:38.010> you<00:00:38.219> know<00:00:38.520> that<00:00:38.550> it's<00:00:38.910> pretty<00:00:39.120> easy

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
letting you know that it's pretty easy

what you're looking for is a 10 minutes

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.000 
what you're looking for is a 10 minutes
breeding<00:00:42.149> process<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.960> it'll<00:00:43.590> take<00:00:43.800> another

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
breeding process and it'll take another

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.270 
breeding process and it'll take another
10<00:00:44.430> minutes<00:00:44.700> for<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.239> egg<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.719> hatch<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.379> with

10 minutes for the egg to hatch and with

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.430 
10 minutes for the egg to hatch and with
what<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.700> egg<00:00:47.879> looks<00:00:48.270> like<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.989> looks<00:00:49.260> like

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
what the egg looks like is it looks like

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.470 
what the egg looks like is it looks like
there's<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.739> rock<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.489> there's<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.090> there's<00:00:51.420> a

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
there's a rock and there's a there's a

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.979 
there's a rock and there's a there's a
leaf<00:00:51.719> on<00:00:51.899> top<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.559> so<00:00:53.449> it'll<00:00:54.449> take<00:00:54.690> ten

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
leaf on top of it so it'll take ten

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.500 
leaf on top of it so it'll take ten
minutes<00:00:55.170> for<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.620> egg<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.980> hatch<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.550> then

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
minutes for the egg to hatch and then

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.799 
minutes for the egg to hatch and then
you<00:00:57.750> can<00:00:57.930> place<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.469> into<00:00:58.920> any<00:00:59.129> plant<00:00:59.820> or<00:01:00.120> Earth

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
you can place it into any plant or Earth

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.720 
you can place it into any plant or Earth
habitat<00:01:01.559> I'm<00:01:01.770> not<00:01:02.010> really<00:01:02.160> sure<00:01:02.399> if<00:01:02.550> these

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
habitat I'm not really sure if these

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.160 
habitat I'm not really sure if these
things<00:01:03.030> are<00:01:03.180> actually<00:01:03.329> called<00:01:03.690> Earth<00:01:03.930> or

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
things are actually called Earth or

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.800 
things are actually called Earth or
plant<00:01:04.470> um<00:01:05.309> actually<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.210> just<00:01:06.299> looked<00:01:06.659> at<00:01:06.780> it

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
plant um actually I just looked at it

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.250 
plant um actually I just looked at it
yeah<00:01:07.229> it's<00:01:07.650> called<00:01:07.950> Earth<00:01:08.659> because<00:01:09.659> some

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
yeah it's called Earth because some

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.230 
yeah it's called Earth because some
games<00:01:10.530> change<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.340> name<00:01:11.580> because<00:01:11.939> they<00:01:12.090> like

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
games change the name because they like

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.149 
games change the name because they like
either<00:01:12.450> calling<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.930> Terra<00:01:13.260> or<00:01:13.710> something<00:01:14.010> else

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
either calling a Terra or something else

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.080 
either calling a Terra or something else
but<00:01:14.640> anyway<00:01:14.760> so<00:01:14.939> here<00:01:15.570> we<00:01:15.689> are<00:01:15.720> looking<00:01:16.409> at<00:01:16.560> the

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
but anyway so here we are looking at the

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.030 
but anyway so here we are looking at the
second<00:01:18.090> evolution<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:19.200> he's<00:01:19.650> doing<00:01:19.860> an

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
second evolution and he's doing an

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.429 
second evolution and he's doing an
animation<00:01:20.189> I<00:01:20.880> guess<00:01:21.299> rain<00:01:21.570> cloud<00:01:22.049> kind<00:01:22.380> of

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
animation I guess rain cloud kind of

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.160 
animation I guess rain cloud kind of
goes<00:01:22.650> on<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.400> then<00:01:23.460> he<00:01:24.030> kind<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.630> hides

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
goes on to it and then he kind of hides

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.289 
goes on to it and then he kind of hides
behind<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.770> leaf<00:01:25.950> on<00:01:26.159> his<00:01:26.310> head<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.729> then

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
behind the leaf on his head and then

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.770 
behind the leaf on his head and then
he's<00:01:27.509> eating<00:01:28.020> some<00:01:28.500> leaf<00:01:28.860> or<00:01:29.220> something

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
he's eating some leaf or something

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.700 
he's eating some leaf or something
anyways<00:01:30.780> so<00:01:31.380> uh<00:01:32.600> let's<00:01:33.600> just<00:01:33.689> evolve<00:01:34.409> this

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
anyways so uh let's just evolve this

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.510 
anyways so uh let's just evolve this
monster<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.280> bit<00:01:36.799> alright<00:01:37.799> so<00:01:37.979> we<00:01:38.130> got<00:01:38.280> new

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.249 
temple to evolve the monster in the game
without<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.520> temple<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.180> will<00:01:57.210> not<00:01:57.630> be<00:01:57.960> able
