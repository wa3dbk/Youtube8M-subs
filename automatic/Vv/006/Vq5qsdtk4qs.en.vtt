00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:55.870 

all<00:00:47.330> right<00:00:47.450> in<00:00:47.870> there<00:00:48.280> okay<00:00:49.720> Huck<00:00:54.730> stuck<00:00:55.730> in

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.590 

but<00:01:39.250> I<00:01:39.280> think<00:01:39.399> what<00:01:39.490> happened<00:01:39.969> there<00:01:40.119> is<00:01:40.360> my

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
but I think what happened there is my

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.039 
but I think what happened there is my
boss<00:01:40.869> wasn't<00:01:41.200> down<00:01:41.560> deep<00:01:41.890> enough<00:01:42.159> so<00:01:43.049> that's

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
boss wasn't down deep enough so that's

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:49.720 
boss wasn't down deep enough so that's
probably<00:01:44.350> a<00:01:44.500> failure<00:01:44.950> there<00:01:45.390> right

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:49.730 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:03:00.470

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
row first tap that didn't really work

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.820 
row first tap that didn't really work
but<00:03:08.410> I<00:03:08.470> think<00:03:08.650> what<00:03:08.770> happened<00:03:09.160> is<00:03:10.620> first<00:03:11.620> of

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:18.360 
but I think what happened is first of
all<00:03:13.950> my<00:03:16.710> there's<00:03:17.710> something<00:03:17.980> wrong<00:03:18.100> with<00:03:18.250> my
