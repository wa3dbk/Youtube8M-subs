now my most viewed videos at about
78,000<00:02:39.780> but<00:02:39.990> it's<00:02:40.140> pretty<00:02:40.380> much<00:02:40.500> stopped

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
78,000 but it's pretty much stopped

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.860 
78,000 but it's pretty much stopped
getting<00:02:41.040> views<00:02:41.400> it<00:02:41.640> goes<00:02:41.790> up<00:02:42.000> a<00:02:42.180> little<00:02:42.480> bit

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
getting views it goes up a little bit

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.650 
getting views it goes up a little bit
every<00:02:42.959> day<00:02:43.110> but<00:02:43.920> I<00:02:44.220> think<00:02:44.610> you<00:02:45.300> know<00:02:45.420> this

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
every day but I think you know this

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.960 
every day but I think you know this
video<00:02:45.989> has<00:02:46.320> potential<00:02:46.890> to<00:02:46.920> reach<00:02:47.160> 100,000

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
video has potential to reach 100,000

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.729 
video has potential to reach 100,000
views<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:48.330> that's<00:02:48.450> my<00:02:48.570> goal<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:49.050> also<00:02:49.560> I

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739

think I'd like 2,000 likes is my goal so

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.790 
think I'd like 2,000 likes is my goal so
yeah<00:02:53.760> it's<00:02:54.090> it's<00:02:54.390> a<00:02:54.540> hefty<00:02:54.840> challenge<00:02:55.350> but

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
yeah it's it's a hefty challenge but

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.650 
yeah it's it's a hefty challenge but
