program<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.860> want<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.850> just<00:00:42.000> incorporate

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
program and I want to just incorporate

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.119 
program and I want to just incorporate
that<00:00:42.719> drawing<00:00:43.230> into<00:00:43.620> manga<00:00:43.770> studio

that drawing into manga studio
unfortunately<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.450> program<00:00:45.750> gives<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.050> a

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
unfortunately the program gives you a

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.350 
unfortunately the program gives you a
couple<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.710> ways<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.100> can<00:00:47.250> do<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:48.030> I

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
couple of ways that you can do that so I

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.660 
couple of ways that you can do that so I
have<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:48.719> clean<00:00:49.620> canvas<00:00:49.920> that's<00:00:50.370> about

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
have this clean canvas that's about

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.549 
have this clean canvas that's about
eight<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.059> half<00:00:51.090> inches<00:00:51.750> by<00:00:51.870> eleven<00:00:52.260> inches

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
done at a low resolution and to do that

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.380 
done at a low resolution and to do that
I'll<00:01:03.570> go<00:01:03.780> up<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:04.019> file<00:01:04.379> import<00:01:06.200> image<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:08.390> I

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
I'll go up to file import image and I

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.020 
I'll go up to file import image and I
would<00:01:09.570> select<00:01:09.780> from<00:01:10.619> any<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.460> selectable

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
would select from any of the selectable

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.240 
would select from any of the selectable
image<00:01:12.390> files<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.900> are<00:01:13.260> available<00:01:13.590> in<00:01:13.979> manga

image files that are available in manga

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.850 
image files that are available in manga
studio<00:01:14.400> for<00:01:15.150> example<00:01:15.570> in<00:01:15.780> this<00:01:16.320> case<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.680> have<00:01:16.830> a

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
studio for example in this case I have a

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.670 
studio for example in this case I have a
couple<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.369> manga<00:01:18.030> studio<00:01:18.180> dot<00:01:18.600> lip<00:01:18.840> files<00:01:19.140> you

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
couple of manga studio dot lip files you

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.120 
couple of manga studio dot lip files you
can't<00:01:20.009> import<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.790> lip<00:01:21.030> file<00:01:21.330> into<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:22.080> lip<00:01:22.890> file

can't import a lip file into a lip file

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.700 
can't import a lip file into a lip file
so<00:01:23.430> those<00:01:23.939> are<00:01:24.119> actually<00:01:24.240> grayed<00:01:24.689> out<00:01:24.720> but<00:01:25.680> I

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
so those are actually grayed out but I

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.670 
so those are actually grayed out but I
have<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.340> couple<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.759> PNG<00:01:27.240> files<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:28.259> jpg

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.640 
have a couple of PNG files and a jpg
file<00:01:28.950> here<00:01:29.600> so<00:01:30.600> I'm<00:01:30.840> going<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.140> import<00:01:31.409> this

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
file here so I'm going to import this

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.090 
file here so I'm going to import this
sketch<00:01:31.950> here<00:01:32.340> click<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.270> click<00:01:34.110> open<00:01:34.439> so

here's<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.000> sketch<00:01:36.390> on<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.960> canvas<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.560> as

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
here's the sketch on the canvas and as

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.289 
here's the sketch on the canvas and as
you<00:01:37.860> can<00:01:37.950> see<00:01:38.009> it's<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.520> little<00:01:38.790> small<00:01:39.119> and

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
you can see it's a little small and

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.730 
you can see it's a little small and
that's<00:01:39.450> because<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:39.840> just<00:01:40.049> drew<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.500> very

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
that's because I just drew it a very

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.130 
that's because I just drew it a very
small<00:01:41.100> size<00:01:41.490> but<00:01:41.970> now<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.150> want<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.630> prep<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.110> for

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
small size but now I want to prep it for

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.039 
small size but now I want to prep it for
inking<00:01:43.680> at<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:44.040> higher<00:01:44.250> resolution<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.600> do

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
inking at a higher resolution and to do

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.990 
inking at a higher resolution and to do
that<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.350> just<00:01:46.500> have<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.890> resize<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.520> image<00:01:47.549> and

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
that I just have to resize the image and

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.969 
that I just have to resize the image and
if<00:01:48.090> you'll<00:01:48.270> notice<00:01:48.360> there's<00:01:49.229> these<00:01:49.500> series<00:01:49.950> of

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
if you'll notice there's these series of

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.590 
if you'll notice there's these series of
anchor<00:01:50.670> points<00:01:50.970> here<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.210> these<00:01:51.329> are<00:01:51.479> your

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
anchor points here and these are your

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.510 
anchor points here and these are your
resize<00:01:52.049> points<00:01:52.560> all<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:52.920> have<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.130> do<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.310> just

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
resize points all I have to do is just

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.149 
resize points all I have to do is just
click<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.850> drag<00:01:54.649> the<00:01:55.649> thing<00:01:55.829> you'll<00:01:55.950> notice

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
click and drag the thing you'll notice

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.740 
click and drag the thing you'll notice
though<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.909> doesn't<00:01:57.149> exactly<00:01:57.540> hold

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
though is that it doesn't exactly hold

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.810 
though is that it doesn't exactly hold
its<00:01:57.930> shape<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.500> that's<00:01:59.159> not<00:01:59.280> really<00:01:59.520> helpful

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
its shape and that's not really helpful

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.569 
its shape and that's not really helpful
so<00:02:00.299> what<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.659> would<00:02:00.780> have<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:00.990> do<00:02:01.409> is<00:02:01.680> hold<00:02:02.490> down

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
so what I would have to do is hold down

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.389 
so what I would have to do is hold down
the<00:02:02.880> shift<00:02:03.119> key<00:02:03.240> on<00:02:03.540> my<00:02:03.719> keyboard<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:05.149> resize

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
the shift key on my keyboard and resize

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.380 
the shift key on my keyboard and resize
like<00:02:08.399> so<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:08.910> then<00:02:09.060> grab<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.270> bottom<00:02:09.979> and

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
like so and then grab the bottom and

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.160 
like so and then grab the bottom and
again

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
again

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.680 
again
resize<00:02:13.880> one<00:02:14.880> other<00:02:15.060> thing<00:02:15.270> to<00:02:15.360> keep<00:02:15.480> in<00:02:15.630> mind

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
resize one other thing to keep in mind

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.660 
resize one other thing to keep in mind
this<00:02:16.110> point<00:02:16.440> here<00:02:16.740> is<00:02:16.890> actually<00:02:17.520> your
