00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
that it might be an animation it looks

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.240 
that it might be an animation it looks
like<00:01:02.699> it's<00:01:02.879> an<00:01:02.969> image<00:01:03.239> anyways<00:01:03.710> but<00:01:04.710> like<00:01:05.010> it

go I thought there was multiple ways
that<00:03:43.959> they<00:03:44.080> could<00:03:44.140> have<00:03:44.320> taken<00:03:44.440> the<00:03:44.650> principal

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
that they could have taken the principal

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.820 
that they could have taken the principal
pull<00:03:45.400> Celestia<00:03:45.850> fake<00:03:46.060> and<00:03:46.330> they<00:03:47.050> took<00:03:47.380> it<00:03:47.440> in

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
pull Celestia fake and they took it in

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.199 
pull Celestia fake and they took it in
none<00:03:48.070> of<00:03:48.100> the<00:03:48.310> ways<00:03:48.489> that<00:03:48.670> I<00:03:48.790> thought<00:03:48.970> it<00:03:49.090> was

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
none of the ways that I thought it was

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:54.090 
none of the ways that I thought it was
gonna<00:03:49.300> be<00:03:49.390> done<00:03:49.630> so<00:03:50.140> good<00:03:50.980> on<00:03:51.160> you<00:03:52.560> what<00:03:53.560> the
