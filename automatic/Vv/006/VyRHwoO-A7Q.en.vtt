00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.300 
the point where you're about to start
the<00:01:36.630> race<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:37.439> need<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.650> pay<00:01:37.799> attention<00:01:37.829> to

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
the race you need to pay attention to

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.469 
the race you need to pay attention to
the<00:01:38.400> bottom<00:01:38.700> right<00:01:38.880> hand<00:01:38.909> corner<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.390> your

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
the bottom right hand corner of your

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.330 
the bottom right hand corner of your
screen<00:01:39.600> because<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.799> where<00:01:40.950> you'll<00:01:41.100> see

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
screen because that is where you'll see

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.700 
screen because that is where you'll see
a<00:01:41.369> world<00:01:41.850> record<00:01:42.060> number<00:01:42.600> however<00:01:43.290> if<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.560> do

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
a world record number however if you do

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.440 
a world record number however if you do
this<00:01:43.860> correctly<00:01:44.070> there<00:01:44.520> will<00:01:44.700> be<00:01:44.850> no<00:01:45.119> number

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
this correctly there will be no number

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.630 
this correctly there will be no number
so<00:01:46.049> if<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.259> pay<00:01:46.380> attention<00:01:46.500> in<00:01:46.950> three<00:01:47.220> seconds

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
so if you pay attention in three seconds

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.210 
so if you pay attention in three seconds
it'll<00:01:47.820> show<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.350> bunch<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:49.680> dashes

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
it'll show and that is a bunch of dashes

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.399 
it'll show and that is a bunch of dashes
and<00:01:50.369> lines<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.149> if<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.540> see<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.259> means

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
and lines and if you see this that means

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.469 
and lines and if you see this that means
you've<00:01:52.560> done<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:52.860> correctly<00:01:53.119> however<00:01:54.119> if<00:01:54.329> you

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
you've done it correctly however if you

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.480 
you've done it correctly however if you
see<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.899> world<00:01:55.110> record<00:01:55.470> twenty<00:01:56.009> nine<00:01:56.159> tenths

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
see the world record twenty nine tenths

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.350

what<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.219> need<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.460> do<00:02:02.579> is<00:02:02.729> go<00:02:02.939> ahead<00:02:02.969> find<00:02:03.869> a

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
what you need to do is go ahead find a

what you need to do is go ahead find a
new<00:02:04.170> session<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.799> host<00:02:05.009> this<00:02:05.250> job<00:02:05.610> again<00:02:05.969> that

new session and host this job again that
way<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:06.899> can<00:02:07.170> get<00:02:07.350> that<00:02:07.409> number<00:02:07.710> showing<00:02:08.099> if

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
way you can get that number showing if

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.219 
way you can get that number showing if
of<00:02:08.940> course<00:02:08.970> you<00:02:09.149> see<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.539> world<00:02:09.720> record<00:02:10.110> and

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
of course you see the world record and

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.250 
of course you see the world record and
not<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.649> actual<00:02:11.720> dashes<00:02:12.720> what<00:02:12.959> you<00:02:13.050> need<00:02:13.200> to

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
not the actual dashes what you need to

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.850 
not the actual dashes what you need to
do<00:02:13.379> is<00:02:13.530> start

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
do is start

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.220 
do is start
and<00:02:14.160> increase<00:02:14.880> your<00:02:14.910> stressors<00:02:15.660> that<00:02:15.720> way<00:02:16.170> to

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
and increase your stressors that way to

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.290 
and increase your stressors that way to
lag<00:02:16.590> it<00:02:16.740> enough<00:02:16.980> unless<00:02:17.730> you<00:02:17.910> can<00:02:18.060> try<00:02:18.240> this

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
lag it enough unless you can try this

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.900 
lag it enough unless you can try this
over<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:18.810> over<00:02:18.900> again<00:02:19.110> so<00:02:19.920> wait<00:02:20.400> is<00:02:20.550> however

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
over and over again so wait is however

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.580 
over and over again so wait is however
long<00:02:21.270> you<00:02:21.420> want<00:02:21.600> for<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:21.900> first<00:02:22.140> lap<00:02:22.410> because

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
long you want for the first lap because

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.200 
long you want for the first lap because
after<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.160> first<00:02:23.400> lap<00:02:23.670> you're<00:02:23.940> going<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.120> have

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
after the first lap you're going to have

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.090 
after the first lap you're going to have
to<00:02:24.360> go<00:02:24.480> faster<00:02:24.720> and<00:02:24.990> faster<00:02:25.170> each<00:02:25.560> time<00:02:25.590> so<00:02:26.040> I

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
to go faster and faster each time so I

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.160 
to go faster and faster each time so I
waited<00:02:26.280> two<00:02:26.550> minutes<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:27.120> right<00:02:27.810> as<00:02:27.930> you<00:02:28.050> do

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
waited two minutes and right as you do

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.810 
waited two minutes and right as you do
the<00:02:28.290> two<00:02:28.410> minutes<00:02:28.710> turn<00:02:29.010> off<00:02:29.040> your<00:02:29.370> stressor

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
the two minutes turn off your stressor

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.420 
the two minutes turn off your stressor
and<00:02:30.000> go<00:02:30.540> right<00:02:30.810> to<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:31.110> checkpoint<00:02:31.380> now<00:02:32.250> what

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
and go right to the checkpoint now what

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.830 
and go right to the checkpoint now what
you<00:02:32.490> need<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:32.700> do<00:02:32.820> from<00:02:32.940> here<00:02:33.150> is<00:02:33.210> course<00:02:33.630> have

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
a faster lap each time and it will give

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.949 
a faster lap each time and it will give
you<00:02:36.180> 10,000<00:02:36.900> RP<00:02:37.320> you<00:02:38.070> can<00:02:38.220> earn<00:02:38.370> ten<00:02:38.610> thousand

rpms you decide to do your laps however
keep<00:02:42.300> in<00:02:42.450> mind<00:02:42.690> that<00:02:42.840> if<00:02:43.020> you<00:02:43.140> do<00:02:43.290> a<00:02:43.320> lap<00:02:43.650> longer

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
keep in mind that if you do a lap longer

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.130 
keep in mind that if you do a lap longer
than<00:02:44.580> what<00:02:44.760> your<00:02:45.000> set<00:02:45.270> your<00:02:45.420> world<00:02:45.630> record<00:02:45.990> to

over a half hour almost 40 minutes of
doing<00:03:16.770> this<00:03:16.890> continuously<00:03:17.550> over<00:03:17.850> and<00:03:17.970> over

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
doing this continuously over and over

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.180 
doing this continuously over and over
again<00:03:18.269> and<00:03:18.600> all<00:03:19.200> you<00:03:19.260> have<00:03:19.320> to<00:03:19.440> do<00:03:19.560> is<00:03:19.709> lap<00:03:19.950> so

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
again and all you have to do is lap so

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.070 
again and all you have to do is lap so
you<00:03:20.280> can<00:03:20.430> sit<00:03:20.700> your<00:03:20.850> car<00:03:21.120> right<00:03:21.570> at<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:21.810> finish

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
you can sit your car right at the finish

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.900 
you can sit your car right at the finish
line<00:03:22.230> or<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.560> checkpoint<00:03:23.100> for<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:23.519> new<00:03:23.670> lap

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
line or the checkpoint for the new lap

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.180 
line or the checkpoint for the new lap
every<00:03:24.299> time<00:03:24.540> and<00:03:24.780> wait<00:03:25.500> that<00:03:25.769> is<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:26.040> most

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
every time and wait that is the most

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.220 
every time and wait that is the most
efficient<00:03:26.670> way<00:03:26.730> so<00:03:27.540> that<00:03:27.570> way<00:03:27.780> you<00:03:27.840> can<00:03:28.080> keep

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
efficient way so that way you can keep

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.470 
efficient way so that way you can keep
this<00:03:28.410> going<00:03:28.799> now<00:03:29.430> make<00:03:29.730> sure<00:03:29.760> when<00:03:30.120> you<00:03:30.269> make<00:03:30.450> a

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
this going now make sure when you make a

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.479 
this going now make sure when you make a
new<00:03:30.720> lap<00:03:30.989> don't<00:03:31.440> make<00:03:31.739> it<00:03:31.860> a<00:03:31.980> minute<00:03:32.220> long

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
new lap don't make it a minute long

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.580 
new lap don't make it a minute long
instead<00:03:33.060> of<00:03:33.090> two<00:03:33.330> minutes<00:03:33.660> because<00:03:34.290> you<00:03:34.440> have

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
instead of two minutes because you have

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.590 
instead of two minutes because you have
to<00:03:34.739> go<00:03:34.860> faster<00:03:35.130> each<00:03:35.580> time<00:03:35.610> so<00:03:36.269> you<00:03:36.330> want<00:03:36.540> to

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
to go faster each time so you want to

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.180 
to go faster each time so you want to
make<00:03:36.630> it<00:03:36.870> instead<00:03:37.410> of<00:03:37.470> two<00:03:37.680> minutes<00:03:37.980> long<00:03:38.160> a

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
make it instead of two minutes long a

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.280 
make it instead of two minutes long a
minute<00:03:38.580> and<00:03:38.670> 59<00:03:39.120> seconds<00:03:39.660> that<00:03:39.870> way<00:03:39.989> you<00:03:40.049> can

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
minute and 59 seconds that way you can

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.650 
minute and 59 seconds that way you can
do<00:03:40.470> laps<00:03:40.769> over<00:03:40.950> and<00:03:41.280> over<00:03:41.370> again<00:03:41.549> and<00:03:41.850> not<00:03:42.390> run

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660
