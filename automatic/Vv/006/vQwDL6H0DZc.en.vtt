his<00:04:55.970> new<00:04:56.260> that's<00:04:57.260> a<00:04:57.290> little<00:04:57.440> odd<00:04:58.060> okay<00:04:59.060> what

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
his new that's a little odd okay what

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:06.750 
his new that's a little odd okay what
around<00:04:59.450> here<00:05:04.419> let's<00:05:05.419> break<00:05:05.750> it<00:05:05.930> open<00:05:06.050> a<00:05:06.320> little

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
around here let's break it open a little

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.670 
around here let's break it open a little
maybe<00:05:07.760> this<00:05:07.940> is<00:05:08.120> maybe<00:05:08.630> some<00:05:08.900> accessory<00:05:09.440> a<00:05:09.470> bit

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
maybe this is maybe some accessory a bit

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:21.800 
maybe this is maybe some accessory a bit
tell<00:05:09.919> me<00:05:10.070> what<00:05:10.220> I<00:05:10.250> do<00:05:10.690> I've<00:05:11.690> disregarded

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.940 

we<00:05:22.440> should<00:05:22.710> actually<00:05:22.860> look<00:05:23.130> what<00:05:23.430> that<00:05:23.460> is

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:24.950 
we should actually look what that is

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.310 
we should actually look what that is
this<00:05:25.950> is<00:05:26.130> extra<00:05:26.580> accessories<00:05:27.540> rather<00:05:28.020> than

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
this is extra accessories rather than

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.110 
this is extra accessories rather than
other<00:05:29.130> than<00:05:29.310> what<00:05:29.520> I've<00:05:29.610> got<00:05:29.760> in<00:05:29.820> the<00:05:29.910> box

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
other than what I've got in the box

other than what I've got in the box
QuickStart<00:05:30.810> guide<00:05:31.020> is<00:05:31.169> gonna<00:05:31.350> be<00:05:31.500> in<00:05:31.590> there

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
QuickStart guide is gonna be in there

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:42.680 
QuickStart guide is gonna be in there
perhaps<00:05:32.010> there's<00:05:32.580> Nico<00:05:41.300> I'm<00:05:42.300> gonna<00:05:42.480> leave<00:05:42.570> it

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
perhaps there's Nico I'm gonna leave it

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:43.700 
perhaps there's Nico I'm gonna leave it
for<00:05:42.780> now<00:05:42.900> someone<00:05:43.230> will<00:05:43.350> tell<00:05:43.500> me<00:05:43.590> in<00:05:43.650> the

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
for now someone will tell me in the

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:44.990 
for now someone will tell me in the
comments<00:05:44.040> of<00:05:44.130> the<00:05:44.190> video<00:05:44.280> I'm<00:05:44.520> sure<00:05:44.669> it's<00:05:44.910> got

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
comments of the video I'm sure it's got

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:55.820 
comments of the video I'm sure it's got
a<00:05:45.030> USB<00:05:45.210> input<00:05:53.180> maybe<00:05:54.180> buddies<00:05:54.540> up<00:05:54.690> with<00:05:54.840> not

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830 
a USB input maybe buddies up with not

headphones<00:06:10.740> so<00:06:11.550> Curtis<00:06:12.030> a<00:06:12.240> pretty<00:06:12.810> boring<00:06:13.020> lot

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:13.590 
headphones so Curtis a pretty boring lot

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:19.219 
headphones so Curtis a pretty boring lot
of<00:06:13.710> standard<00:06:14.100> stuff<00:06:17.060> if<00:06:18.060> we<00:06:18.120> just<00:06:18.360> compare<00:06:18.570> the

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:19.229 
of standard stuff if we just compare the

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:21.890 
of standard stuff if we just compare the
Wildfire<00:06:19.800> to<00:06:20.070> the<00:06:20.250> to<00:06:21.060> the<00:06:21.180> Nexus<00:06:21.570> 1<00:06:21.870> I

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 
Wildfire to the to the Nexus 1 I

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.909 
Wildfire to the to the Nexus 1 I
supposed<00:06:22.350> to<00:06:22.530> get<00:06:22.740> a<00:06:22.770> bit<00:06:22.979> of<00:06:23.100> a<00:06:23.720> embarrassing

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:24.919 
supposed to get a bit of a embarrassing

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:28.070 
supposed to get a bit of a embarrassing
so<00:06:25.919> much<00:06:26.850> the<00:06:27.030> same<00:06:27.210> thickness<00:06:27.540> but<00:06:27.900> as<00:06:27.990> you

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 
so much the same thickness but as you

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.090 
so much the same thickness but as you
can<00:06:28.169> see<00:06:30.229> quite<00:06:31.229> a<00:06:31.290> bit<00:06:31.410> shorter<00:06:31.620> there<00:06:31.979> is<00:06:32.070> a

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:32.100 
can see quite a bit shorter there is a

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.340 
can see quite a bit shorter there is a
slight<00:06:32.669> lip<00:06:33.000> again<00:06:33.210> at<00:06:33.479> the<00:06:33.540> front<00:06:33.720> like<00:06:34.110> they

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:34.350 
slight lip again at the front like they

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:41.950 
slight lip again at the front like they
just<00:06:34.530> did<00:06:34.800> with<00:06:35.010> the<00:06:35.100> desire

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:41.960 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.950 

so<00:06:42.960> I<00:06:43.080> mean<00:06:43.500> yes<00:06:44.009> not<00:06:44.569> when<00:06:45.569> you<00:06:45.629> looked<00:06:45.780> at<00:06:45.840> I

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:45.960 
so I mean yes not when you looked at I

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.180 
so I mean yes not when you looked at I
valued<00:06:46.319> you<00:06:46.530> see<00:06:46.710> there's<00:06:46.889> not<00:06:47.009> really<00:06:47.099> that

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:47.190 
valued you see there's not really that

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:48.650 
valued you see there's not really that
much<00:06:47.370> difference<00:06:47.759> in<00:06:47.879> size<00:06:48.090> between<00:06:48.120> them

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:48.660 
much difference in size between them

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.899 
much difference in size between them
that's<00:06:49.590> right<00:06:49.919> so<00:06:50.220> it<00:06:50.430> does<00:06:50.580> look<00:06:50.759> a<00:06:50.789> bit

00:06:50.899 --> 00:06:50.909 
that's right so it does look a bit

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:54.230 
that's right so it does look a bit
smaller<00:06:51.330> and<00:06:51.449> a<00:06:51.599> bit<00:06:51.780> sort<00:06:52.080> of<00:06:53.120> easier<00:06:54.120> to

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 
smaller and a bit sort of easier to

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.020 
smaller and a bit sort of easier to
handle<00:06:55.069> anyway<00:06:56.069> that's<00:06:56.250> just<00:06:56.310> a<00:06:56.490> quick<00:06:56.759> a

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.030 
handle anyway that's just a quick a

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:01.640 
handle anyway that's just a quick a
quick<00:06:57.330> look<00:06:57.629> at<00:06:57.810> the<00:06:57.960> device<00:06:58.789> I'll<00:06:59.789> be<00:07:00.530> as<00:07:01.530> you

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:01.650 
quick look at the device I'll be as you

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:04.309 
quick look at the device I'll be as you
would<00:07:01.770> expect<00:07:01.889> I<00:07:02.580> have<00:07:03.120> a<00:07:03.419> review<00:07:03.840> up<00:07:04.139> on

00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319 
would expect I have a review up on
