00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.880
 Hello everyone, I am RXSFAI. 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.140
 Got the video of the equipment series again. 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.400
 In this series of videos, I will try to use my message list for my equipment. 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.720
 Then I will use the accessories and equipment to make a review for your reference. 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.500
 So if you have any complete equipment list, I want to try it out. 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.100
 Don't forget to leave a message and talk about your equipment. 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.380
 I will choose one of the comments for the next topic. 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.460
 This time the equipment is from Longma Stream (negative leather studio) 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.220
 The main weapon is MP7 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.480
 Accessories use full image [1X], green point laser sight, silencer, painting using tiger snow 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:47.540
 The secondary weapon is Desert Eagle.44, equipped with mini [inside red dot], silencer, laser sight, and painting also uses tiger snow. 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.960
 Equipment 1 is RPG and Equipment 2 is M2 mine 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.560
 Battlefield upgrade skill selection [ghost], army knife selection BJ-2 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.780
 This list of equipment, whether it is accessories or pistols, is similar to what I usually use. 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.280
 The only thing that may be different is that I will not use M2 mines frequently, but instead use maintenance tools. 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.280
 Because I personally play more large-scale conquest maps, and I prefer to use vehicles. 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.960
 So often use maintenance tools 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.080
 Then say MP7 back to the main weapon. 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.160
 MP7 can hit 950 bullets per minute 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.560
 The rate of fire is very fast 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.880
 The only PDW that is faster than its rate of fire is the CZ-3A1 with 1000RPM. 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.280
 So at a close distance, MP7 should have certain advantages. 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.320
 But unfortunately the power of MP7 is relatively thin, the maximum power is only 20, the lowest is 12.5 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.720
 So MP7 is limited by the combat distance 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.500
 If you need to play a farther enemy, it will never cause any threat. 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:50.420
 At close range, because you are using the high rate of attack of the MP7 to smash the enemy 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.240
 And MP7 also has the high lumbar performance of PDW. 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.320
 So the scope doesn't need a special choice, as long as there is a clear alignment, it is very suitable. 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.160
 I personally chose the hologram [x1] because of a cosmetic problem. 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.180
 On the grip accessories, you can see that the MP7 is fixed using the folding grip accessories. 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:15.680
 So many players may naturally estimate that MP7 is suitable for semi-automatic point-and-shoot transmission. 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:23.800
 But even if the MP7 is fixed with a folding grip, the recoil of the first shot is still quite a lot. 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.540
 And its bullets are also very slow at the beginning. 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.020
 So everyone should not misunderstand that it is a gun that is good at long range. 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.540
 MP7 can only play at close range 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:41.500
 But many PDWs are also high-speed guns, and they can also perform well at close range. 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:48.620
 If the magazine is the advantage of the MP7, then the P90 is only a little slower than it, but it is bigger than its magazine. 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.260
 So the 40-shot magazine is not the most special place. 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.100
 Some people may not notice, in fact, MP7's total carrying capacity is the most 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.740
 Of course, this total amount of bombs must not match the guns of the light machine guns. 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.180
 Generally in the BF4 gun, do not count the impeachment that you increase after you open the [attack] skill. 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:14.680
 You should only have 4 reserve magazines, while the general magazines are mostly 30 rounds, plus the bullet in the upper chamber. 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:21.900
 That should be 31 rounds of ammunition and 124 rounds of reserve bullets, a total of 155 rounds of bullets. 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:30.100
 The MP7 is different. Because its magazine is 40 rounds, plus its 4 reserve magazine bullets, there will be a total of 205 bullets. 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.080
 And this is the difference between it and other PDWs that use large magazines. 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:43.740
 Both P90 and CBJ-MS use 50 rounds of ammunition, but as a weapon balance, they only have 2 reserve magazines. 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.040
 So their holding power is very high, it is easy to not play. 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:55.120
 But MP7 doesn't have this problem, because the MP7's magazine is not considered to be a large magazine, so the number of magazines is the same as a normal gun. 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.880
 So I often choose MP7 on some large conquered maps. 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:06.320
 Because on the large conquered map, you have to meet the support soldiers, and the players that will give you ammunition are few. 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.960
 So I always use MP7 with a lot of bombs. 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.100
 But because it can only play at some close distance 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.540
 So I only use MP7 on some maps with city buildings. 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:25.080
 Because on those maps, there are more opportunities for close-range warfare, it will be easier to give play to its advantages. 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:32.220
 The equipment used in this equipment is similar to my usual, so why do I install a silencer on the MP7? 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.880
 That's because the MP7's bullets have low initial velocity. 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.240
 Even if I installed a silencer and slowed down the bullet's initial velocity, it didn't matter much. 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:48.000
 And I only fight at close range, the silencer can help me not be found when attacking a whole team of enemies. 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.960
 I will not use MARE'S LEG or .44 McGonnon for pistols. 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.280
 There should be some people here who would like to ask me, wouldn't I usually introduce some long-distance secondary weapons? 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.980
 Shouldn't they be chosen to make up for the shortage of weapons? 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:08.640
 That's because since you used MP7, it means you need to keep fighting in some more intense close-range battlefields. 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.500
 So in fact, using some high-speed pistols will be more suitable for you. 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:18.620
 Suppose you really need to attack a long-range target. In fact, RPG may be a more effective weapon. 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.940
 If you are using engineers, you often feel that you always owe one or two magazines. 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.680
 Then I said it this time. 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.460
 Remember the message let me know the list of equipment you want me to try. 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.160
 Thank you for watching, we will see you in the next video, byebye
