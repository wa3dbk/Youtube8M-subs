00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
well our name here I don't have that

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.150 
well our name here I don't have that
many<00:00:11.969> this<00:00:12.269> was<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.599> new<00:00:12.719> new<00:00:13.200> protection<00:00:14.099> I

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
many this was the new new protection I

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.860 
many this was the new new protection I
don't<00:00:14.340> have<00:00:14.460> to<00:00:14.549> upgrade<00:00:14.730> anything<00:00:15.240> it's<00:00:15.660> it

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
don't have to upgrade anything it's it

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.240 
don't have to upgrade anything it's it
just<00:00:16.049> comes<00:00:16.320> so<00:00:16.619> it's<00:00:16.770> I<00:00:16.830> think<00:00:16.920> that's<00:00:17.190> a

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
just comes so it's I think that's a

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.620 
just comes so it's I think that's a
unique<00:00:17.430> one<00:00:17.730> because<00:00:18.029> I<00:00:18.119> was<00:00:18.240> true<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.480> the

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
unique one because I was true to the

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.960 
unique one because I was true to the
light<00:00:18.779> side<00:00:18.960> so<00:00:19.109> I<00:00:19.170> was<00:00:19.439> indeed<00:00:19.830> set<00:00:20.670> in<00:00:20.850> the

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
light side so I was indeed set in the

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.859 
light side so I was indeed set in the
light<00:00:21.150> sideways<00:00:23.390> there's<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.449> couple<00:00:24.779> of

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
light sideways there's a couple of

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.390 
light sideways there's a couple of
things<00:00:25.019> I<00:00:25.230> wish<00:00:25.410> if<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:25.740> like<00:00:25.980> I<00:00:26.039> said<00:00:26.220> it<00:00:26.369> is

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
things I wish if I like I said it is

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.859 
things I wish if I like I said it is
secret<00:00:26.910> base<00:00:27.090> so<00:00:27.240> if<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.420> find<00:00:27.630> all<00:00:27.779> the

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
secret base so if you find all the

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.929 
secret base so if you find all the
secrets<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.519> basically<00:00:29.519> be<00:00:29.609> able<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.820> upgrade

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
secrets I basically be able to upgrade

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.749 
secrets I basically be able to upgrade
most<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.779> these<00:00:30.900> you<00:00:31.740> know<00:00:31.830> what<00:00:31.859> I<00:00:31.949> mean<00:00:32.099> I

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
most of these you know what I mean I

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.229 
most of these you know what I mean I
think<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:34.290> might<00:00:34.680> do<00:00:35.280> one<00:00:35.520> into<00:00:35.790> each<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:36.149> these

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
think I might do one into each of these

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.060 
think I might do one into each of these
just<00:00:36.600> so<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:36.780> have<00:00:37.020> like<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.380> balance<00:00:37.860> because<00:00:38.010> I

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
just so I have like a balance because I

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.709 
just so I have like a balance because I
have<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.219> feeling<00:00:38.399> I'll<00:00:38.610> need<00:00:38.790> them<00:00:39.030> so<00:00:39.629> the

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
have a feeling I'll need them so the

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.180 
have a feeling I'll need them so the
more<00:00:39.870> secrets<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.350> find<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.770> better<00:00:40.920> it'll<00:00:41.129> be

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
more secrets I find the better it'll be

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.350 
more secrets I find the better it'll be
in<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.550> more<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.760> these<00:00:41.820> I'll<00:00:42.030> be<00:00:42.120> able<00:00:42.270> to

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
in the more of these I'll be able to

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.150 
in the more of these I'll be able to
unlock<00:00:42.719> I<00:00:42.960> hope<00:00:43.230> I'm<00:00:43.500> pretty<00:00:43.770> sure<00:00:43.920> that's<00:00:44.010> how
