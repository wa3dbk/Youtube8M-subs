00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970 
okay now we have some point without

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.760 
okay now we have some point without
touching<00:01:02.450> the<00:01:02.690> speed<00:01:02.960> control<00:01:03.350> I'm<00:01:03.440> gonna<00:01:03.590> put

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:03.770 
touching the speed control I'm gonna put

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.170 
touching the speed control I'm gonna put
a<00:01:03.800> 33<00:01:04.339> rpm<00:01:04.550> record<00:01:05.120> on<00:01:05.270> this<00:01:05.480> thing<00:01:07.180> without

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
a 33 rpm record on this thing without

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:15.219 
a 33 rpm record on this thing without
changing<00:01:08.780> the<00:01:08.900> speed<00:01:09.400> you<00:01:10.400> get<00:01:10.700> a<00:01:10.729> 33<00:01:11.360> here<00:01:14.229> I'm

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
changing the speed you get a 33 here I'm

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.590 
changing the speed you get a 33 here I'm
working<00:01:15.800> with<00:01:15.920> one<00:01:16.130> hand<00:01:16.369> again<00:01:16.760> as<00:01:17.150> we<00:01:17.360> know

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
working with one hand again as we know

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.740 
working with one hand again as we know
how<00:01:17.869> nice<00:01:18.170> that<00:01:18.470> works<00:01:18.650> out<00:01:18.920> and<00:01:19.850> put<00:01:20.660> this

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
how nice that works out and put this

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.280 
how nice that works out and put this
over<00:01:20.990> here<00:01:21.290> like<00:01:21.440> that<00:01:22.270> now<00:01:23.270> leave<00:01:23.840> the<00:01:23.960> speed

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
over here like that now leave the speed

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:32.530 
over here like that now leave the speed
just<00:01:24.560> the<00:01:24.680> way<00:01:24.800> it<00:01:24.890> is<00:01:25.010> on<00:01:26.590> 45<00:01:31.119> and<00:01:32.119> it<00:01:32.300> hit<00:01:32.420> the

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
just the way it is on 45 and it hit the

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.340 
just the way it is on 45 and it hit the
flag<00:01:32.810> and<00:01:33.110> automatically<00:01:33.770> went<00:01:34.190> to<00:01:34.250> 33<00:01:34.820> rpm

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
flag and automatically went to 33 rpm

00:01:35.350 --> 00:02:22.270 
flag and automatically went to 33 rpm
cool<00:01:36.350> as<00:01:36.710> hell

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.430 

of<00:02:23.280> course<00:02:23.520> it's<00:02:23.700> that's<00:02:23.850> a<00:02:23.970> velocity<00:02:24.450> trip<00:02:24.810> so

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
of course it's that's a velocity trip so

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.400 
of course it's that's a velocity trip so
that<00:02:25.470> when<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:25.800> move<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.220> arm<00:02:26.900> it<00:02:27.900> will<00:02:30.410> it'll

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
that when you move the arm it will it'll

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.650 
that when you move the arm it will it'll
usually<00:02:31.590> pick<00:02:32.100> up<00:02:32.280> before<00:02:32.790> it's<00:02:33.090> before<00:02:33.360> it

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
usually pick up before it's before it

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.950 
usually pick up before it's before it
gets<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.080> end<00:02:34.260> of<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.410> record<00:02:34.590> makes<00:02:35.250> playing

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
gets the end of the record makes playing

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.870 
gets the end of the record makes playing
single<00:02:36.960> tracks<00:02:37.650> difficult<00:02:38.370> but<00:02:38.610> it's<00:02:38.760> just

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
single tracks difficult but it's just

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.360 
single tracks difficult but it's just
the<00:02:39.060> way<00:02:39.180> it<00:02:39.270> is<00:02:39.680> now<00:02:40.680> you<00:02:40.800> notice<00:02:41.070> at<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.250> end

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
the way it is now you notice at the end

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.950 
the way it is now you notice at the end
of<00:02:41.460> the<00:02:41.520> record<00:02:41.700> this<00:02:41.940> does<00:02:42.120> not<00:02:42.270> shut<00:02:42.600> off<00:02:42.630> it

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
of the record this does not shut off it

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.320 
of the record this does not shut off it
keeps<00:02:43.200> turning<00:02:43.500> this<00:02:44.010> is<00:02:44.220> a<00:02:44.430> this<00:02:44.820> was<00:02:44.970> a<00:02:45.000> very

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
keeps turning this is a this was a very

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.840 
keeps turning this is a this was a very
low-end<00:02:45.930> machine<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.650> changer<00:02:47.280> was<00:02:47.490> the<00:02:47.640> same

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
low-end machine the changer was the same

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.790 
low-end machine the changer was the same
when<00:02:48.000> they<00:02:48.090> put<00:02:48.300> in<00:02:48.360> their<00:02:48.480> best<00:02:48.720> machines<00:02:49.200> but

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
when they put in their best machines but

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.460 
when they put in their best machines but
they<00:02:49.980> cut<00:02:50.310> corners<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:50.970> cut<00:02:51.150> costs<00:02:51.720> by<00:02:51.930> not

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
they cut corners to cut costs by not

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.410 
they cut corners to cut costs by not
giving<00:02:52.860> you<00:02:52.950> a<00:02:52.980> switch<00:02:53.370> for<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.700> changer<00:02:54.090> the

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
giving you a switch for the changer the

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.780 
giving you a switch for the changer the
switch<00:02:54.660> is<00:02:54.810> on<00:02:54.959> the<00:02:55.110> front<00:02:55.350> of<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.790> switches

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
switch is on the front of the switches

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.570 
switch is on the front of the switches
on<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:56.940> front<00:02:57.270> of<00:02:57.330> the<00:02:57.590> panel<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.740> amp<00:02:59.190> turns

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
on the front of the panel the amp turns

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.010 
on the front of the panel the amp turns
off<00:02:59.850> the<00:03:00.060> record<00:03:00.390> player<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:00.720> that's<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:00.930> way

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
off the record player and that's the way

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.840 
off the record player and that's the way
it<00:03:01.080> was<00:03:01.170> supposed<00:03:01.500> to<00:03:01.620> be<00:03:01.800> but<00:03:02.310> anyway<00:03:02.580> there's

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
it was supposed to be but anyway there's

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.479 
it was supposed to be but anyway there's
the<00:03:03.030> webcore<00:03:03.750> magic<00:03:04.170> mind<00:03:04.440> all<00:03:04.770> set<00:03:05.100> ready<00:03:05.340> to

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
the webcore magic mind all set ready to

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.110 
the webcore magic mind all set ready to
go<00:03:05.700> and<00:03:06.540> that's<00:03:06.870> it
