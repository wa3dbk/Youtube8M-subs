00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.580 
different ways to do it but something
that<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.150> notice<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.570> that<00:00:27.630> most<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.289> them<00:00:28.439> are

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
that I notice is that most of them are

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.490 
that I notice is that most of them are
all<00:00:28.740> pastel<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.670> though<00:00:30.599> it's<00:00:30.779> beautiful<00:00:31.320> I

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
all pastel and though it's beautiful I

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.860 
all pastel and though it's beautiful I
personally<00:00:32.099> don't<00:00:32.700> decorate<00:00:33.300> with<00:00:33.450> pastel

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
personally don't decorate with pastel

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.450 
personally don't decorate with pastel
that<00:00:33.899> much<00:00:34.230> I'm<00:00:34.469> into<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.829> more<00:00:34.980> darker

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
that much I'm into the more darker

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.850 
that much I'm into the more darker
colors<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.540> I'm<00:00:36.870> like<00:00:37.079> oh<00:00:37.230> let's<00:00:37.530> try<00:00:37.770> to

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
colors so I'm like oh let's try to

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.530 
colors so I'm like oh let's try to
figure<00:00:38.010> out<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.250> way<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.399> make<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.910> darker<00:00:39.360> and

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
figure out a way to make it darker and

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.600 
figure out a way to make it darker and
the<00:00:40.290> other<00:00:40.469> thing<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:40.950> noticed<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.550> that

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
the other thing that I noticed is that

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.410 
the other thing that I noticed is that
when<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.690> do<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.320> cotton<00:00:44.010> method<00:00:44.460> which<00:00:45.059> is

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
when you do the cotton method which is

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.279 
when you do the cotton method which is
absolutely<00:00:46.170> gorgeous<00:00:46.670> but<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:48.120> can't<00:00:48.510> fill

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
absolutely gorgeous but you can't fill

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.600 
absolutely gorgeous but you can't fill
it<00:00:49.320> with<00:00:49.620> anything<00:00:50.010> because<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.460> whole

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
it with anything because the whole

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.580 
it with anything because the whole
thing's<00:00:50.850> filled<00:00:51.120> with<00:00:51.270> cotton<00:00:51.600> in<00:00:51.690> water<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.559> I

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
thing's filled with cotton in water so I

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.380 
thing's filled with cotton in water so I
try<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.129> think<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.550> way<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.730> prevent<00:00:54.239> that

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
try to think of a way to prevent that

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.740 
try to think of a way to prevent that
but<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:55.050> have<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.500> glitter<00:00:55.770> effect<00:00:56.190> anyway<00:00:57.149> so

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
but to have the glitter effect anyway so

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.330

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.340 

there's<00:02:27.650> so<00:02:27.830> much<00:02:28.100> that<00:02:28.700> I<00:02:28.880> have<00:02:29.540> told<00:02:29.840> now

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
there's so much that I have told now

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.200 
there's so much that I have told now
with<00:02:30.620> my<00:02:30.830> next<00:02:31.220> glitter<00:02:31.520> polish<00:02:32.000> I'm

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
with my next glitter polish I'm

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.690 
with my next glitter polish I'm
basically<00:02:32.690> just<00:02:32.810> going<00:02:33.260> over<00:02:33.620> my<00:02:33.770> work<00:02:34.160> but

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
basically just going over my work but

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.950 
basically just going over my work but
spreading<00:02:35.060> it<00:02:35.240> out<00:02:35.360> a<00:02:35.390> little<00:02:35.660> further

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
spreading it out a little further

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.720 
spreading it out a little further
because<00:02:36.260> it<00:02:36.560> gives<00:02:36.740> you<00:02:36.860> a<00:02:36.920> nice<00:02:37.190> glitter

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
because it gives you a nice glitter

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.120

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
and I'm using a paintbrush because it

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.280

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.430 

you<00:03:13.860> must<00:03:14.190> be<00:03:14.550> so<00:03:15.360> because<00:03:15.930> you<00:03:16.110> can<00:03:16.140> never

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440

bold color this glitter in this polish

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.699 
bold color this glitter in this polish
is<00:03:23.700> actually<00:03:24.180> a<00:03:24.209> little<00:03:24.569> more<00:03:24.780> fine<00:03:25.140> whereas

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
is actually a little more fine whereas

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.650 
is actually a little more fine whereas
the<00:03:25.830> other<00:03:26.010> ones<00:03:26.280> were<00:03:26.459> a<00:03:26.489> bit<00:03:26.760> more<00:03:26.970> chunky<00:03:27.300> I

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
the other ones were a bit more chunky I

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.449 
the other ones were a bit more chunky I
just<00:03:28.170> really<00:03:28.410> like<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:28.769> effect<00:03:28.860> of<00:03:29.280> using

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
just really like the effect of using

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:35.540 
just really like the effect of using
different<00:03:29.819> size<00:03:30.239> glitters<00:03:33.709> so<00:03:34.709> now<00:03:34.950> it's<00:03:35.250> time

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
different size glitters so now it's time

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.820 
different size glitters so now it's time
for<00:03:35.580> painting<00:03:36.120> and<00:03:36.540> I'm<00:03:37.170> just<00:03:37.410> going<00:03:37.620> to<00:03:37.680> be

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
using some black acrylic paint and I

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.350 
using some black acrylic paint and I
