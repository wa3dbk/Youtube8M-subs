kind of perfected in the last couple

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.950 
kind of perfected in the last couple
years<00:00:44.400> it's<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.180> perfect<00:00:45.480> move<00:00:45.630> because<00:00:45.810> not

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
years it's a perfect move because not

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.420 
years it's a perfect move because not
only<00:00:45.990> does<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.290> give<00:00:46.440> them<00:00:46.560> extra<00:00:46.800> separation

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
only does it give them extra separation

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.340

to<00:00:47.490> get<00:00:47.610> off<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.790> shot<00:00:47.820> but<00:00:48.480> also<00:00:48.660> most<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.260> the

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
to get off a shot but also most of the

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.930 
to get off a shot but also most of the
time<00:00:49.470> draws<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.770> foul<00:00:50.040> on<00:00:50.220> this<00:00:50.340> defender<00:00:50.730> so

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
time draws a foul on this defender so

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.370 
time draws a foul on this defender so
because<00:00:51.210> not<00:00:51.390> only<00:00:51.420> do<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.690> get<00:00:51.840> separation

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:52.380 
because not only do you get separation

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.690 
because not only do you get separation
but<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.590> also<00:00:52.710> drop<00:00:52.980> files<00:00:53.220> this<00:00:53.400> move<00:00:53.580> is

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
you can't go wrong with locking your

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.260 
you can't go wrong with locking your
eyes<00:01:43.710> on<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.950> top<00:01:44.190> corner<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.729> square<00:01:45.090> and
