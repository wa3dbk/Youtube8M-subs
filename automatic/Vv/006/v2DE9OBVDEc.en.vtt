actually vacuum pack water if you want
to<00:00:28.109> all<00:00:28.289> right<00:00:28.380> so<00:00:28.439> let's<00:00:28.650> check<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:28.890> out<00:00:38.059> all

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
to all right so let's check it out all

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.100 
to all right so let's check it out all
right<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:39.270> let's<00:00:39.420> start<00:00:39.600> out<00:00:39.690> with<00:00:39.899> something

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
right so let's start out with something

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.450 
right so let's start out with something
you<00:00:40.290> might<00:00:40.440> be<00:00:40.530> familiar<00:00:40.710> with<00:00:40.920> this<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.430> a

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
you might be familiar with this is a

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.360 
you might be familiar with this is a
food<00:00:41.910> saver<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:42.570> this<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:42.780> an<00:00:42.870> external

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
food saver so this is an external

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.040 
food saver so this is an external
Channel<00:00:44.370> style<00:00:44.700> vacuum<00:00:45.210> sealer<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.840> can

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
Channel style vacuum sealer that you can

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.590 
Channel style vacuum sealer that you can
use<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.860> idea<00:00:47.100> here<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.579> this<00:00:48.180> machine

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
use and the idea here is this machine

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.959 
use and the idea here is this machine
will<00:00:48.930> pump<00:00:49.230> out<00:00:49.379> air<00:00:49.770> inside<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.550> this<00:00:50.670> channel

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
will pump out air inside of this channel

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.660 
will pump out air inside of this channel
and<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.629> put<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.989> bag<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.530> unopened<00:00:53.160> bag<00:00:53.430> or

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
and you put the bag the unopened bag or

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.150 
and you put the bag the unopened bag or
the<00:00:53.760> open<00:00:54.030> edge<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.449> bag<00:00:54.690> into<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.680> into

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
the open edge of the bag into the into

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.549 
the open edge of the bag into the into
here<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.699> then<00:00:57.120> it'll<00:00:57.360> suck<00:00:57.719> out<00:00:57.899> all<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.199> the

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
here and then it'll suck out all of the

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.170 
here and then it'll suck out all of the
air<00:00:58.739> that's<00:00:58.980> in<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.190> bag<00:00:59.550> in<00:00:59.820> this<00:00:59.969> chamber

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
air that's in the bag in this chamber

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.610 
air that's in the bag in this chamber
and<00:01:00.420> then<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.629> has<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.780> heat<00:01:01.079> seal<00:01:01.350> and

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
and then it has a heat seal and

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.590 
and then it has a heat seal and
basically<00:01:02.280> locks<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.090> know<00:01:03.180> like<00:01:03.390> that

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
basically locks it you know like that

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.570 
basically locks it you know like that
with<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.870> air<00:01:04.019> pulled<00:01:04.379> out<00:01:04.619> now<00:01:05.129> one<00:01:05.339> big

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
with the air pulled out now one big

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.370 
with the air pulled out now one big
disadvantage<00:01:05.909> of<00:01:06.420> this<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.869> let<00:01:07.049> me<00:01:07.080> show<00:01:07.290> you

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
disadvantage of this and let me show you

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.780 
disadvantage of this and let me show you
this<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.680> really<00:01:08.010> gross<00:01:08.250> but<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:08.670> what

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
this is really gross but this is what

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.850 
this is really gross but this is what
happened<00:01:09.090> last<00:01:09.119> time<00:01:09.360> I<00:01:09.479> used<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.170> there<00:01:10.740> you

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
happened last time I used it there you

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.700 
happened last time I used it there you
go<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.189> can<00:01:11.280> see<00:01:11.580> there's<00:01:11.880> um<00:01:12.210> some<00:01:12.710> liquid

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
go so you can see there's um some liquid

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.039 
go so you can see there's um some liquid
in<00:01:13.799> there<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.220> some<00:01:14.820> juice<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.420> whatever<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.990> is

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
in there so some juice of whatever it is

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.109 
in there so some juice of whatever it is
that<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.380> sealed<00:01:16.740> up<00:01:16.950> basically<00:01:17.670> got<00:01:17.820> sucked

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
that I sealed up basically got sucked

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.090 
that I sealed up basically got sucked
into<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.509> chamber<00:01:18.930> while<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.530> was<00:01:19.770> doing<00:01:20.009> this

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
into the chamber while I was doing this

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.399 
into the chamber while I was doing this
now<00:01:20.310> if<00:01:20.490> enough<00:01:20.820> gets<00:01:21.060> in<00:01:21.270> there<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:22.229> could

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
now if enough gets in there it could

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.800 
now if enough gets in there it could
potentially<00:01:22.500> follow<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.810> potentially

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
potentially follow the potentially

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.330 
potentially follow the potentially
follow<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.259> pump<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.680> everything<00:01:26.009> gets<00:01:26.220> all

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
follow the pump and everything gets all

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.490 
follow the pump and everything gets all
messed<00:01:26.610> up<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.630> that's<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.930> big<00:01:28.140> disadvantage

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
messed up so that's the big disadvantage

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.620 
messed up so that's the big disadvantage
of<00:01:29.070> these<00:01:29.280> types<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.700> things<00:01:29.880> also<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.570> know

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
of these types of things also you know

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.030 
of these types of things also you know
these<00:01:30.750> are<00:01:30.869> cheap<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.259> know<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.590> pumps<00:01:31.860> kind

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
these are cheap you know the pumps kind

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.260 
these are cheap you know the pumps kind
of<00:01:32.100> give<00:01:32.250> out<00:01:32.400> after<00:01:32.640> time<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:32.970> don't<00:01:33.090> get<00:01:33.150> as

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
of give out after time you don't get as

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.210 
of give out after time you don't get as
good<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.720> seal<00:01:33.960> as<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.229> used<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.530> have<00:01:34.740> this

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
good of a seal as you used to have this

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.920 
good of a seal as you used to have this
one's<00:01:35.490> kind<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.790> on<00:01:35.909> its<00:01:35.939> last<00:01:36.270> legs<00:01:36.570> which<00:01:36.720> got

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
one's kind of on its last legs which got

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.569 
one's kind of on its last legs which got
me<00:01:36.960> thinking<00:01:37.079> about<00:01:37.380> getting<00:01:38.189> something<00:01:38.549> a

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
me thinking about getting something a

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.999 
me thinking about getting something a
little<00:01:38.790> bit<00:01:38.939> bigger<00:01:39.180> now<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:40.259> chamber<00:01:40.619> how<00:01:40.890> it

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
little bit bigger now the chamber how it

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.950 
little bit bigger now the chamber how it
works<00:01:41.220> is<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:41.549> put<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.240> put<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.450> food<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:42.869> the

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
works is you put you put the food in the

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.690 
works is you put you put the food in the
bag<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.320> then<00:01:43.380> put<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.680> bag<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.159> entire<00:01:44.430> bag

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
bag and then put the bag the entire bag

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.330 
bag and then put the bag the entire bag
inside<00:01:45.299> of<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.570> chamber<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.140> then<00:01:46.770> what<00:01:47.250> it

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
inside of the chamber and then what it

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.149 
inside of the chamber and then what it
does<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.479> sucks<00:01:49.079> out<00:01:49.259> or<00:01:49.470> pumps<00:01:49.799> out<00:01:49.950> all

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
does is it it sucks out or pumps out all

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.550 
does is it it sucks out or pumps out all
of<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.549> air<00:01:50.820> inside<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.659> entire<00:01:51.899> chamber<00:01:52.229> and

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
of the air inside the entire chamber and

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.920 
of the air inside the entire chamber and
then<00:01:53.159> which<00:01:53.549> also<00:01:53.759> includes<00:01:54.180> inside<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.720> bag

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
then which also includes inside the bag

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.230 
then which also includes inside the bag
so<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.409> bag<00:01:55.649> is<00:01:55.950> at<00:01:56.310> equal<00:01:56.670> pressure<00:01:56.909> to

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
so the bag is at equal pressure to

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.340 
so the bag is at equal pressure to
everything<00:01:57.509> else<00:01:57.659> inside<00:01:57.990> of<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.200> and

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
everything else inside of it and

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.910 
everything else inside of it and
actually<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:58.979> sucks<00:01:59.219> out<00:01:59.369> so<00:01:59.670> much<00:01:59.850> that<00:01:59.909> if<00:02:00.920> it

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
actually it sucks out so much that if it

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.469 
actually it sucks out so much that if it
creates<00:02:02.250> such<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.399> strong<00:02:02.700> vacuum<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:03.270> if

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
creates such a strong vacuum that if

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.770 
creates such a strong vacuum that if
whatever<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:03.990> have<00:02:04.200> is<00:02:04.469> not<00:02:05.030> cold<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.689> will

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
whatever you have is not cold it will

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.300 
whatever you have is not cold it will
actually<00:02:06.930> start<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.290> boil<00:02:07.530> so<00:02:07.890> you'll<00:02:08.039> see<00:02:08.190> it

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
actually start to boil so you'll see it

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.309 
actually start to boil so you'll see it
boiling<00:02:08.640> in<00:02:09.000> there<00:02:09.179> at<00:02:09.360> room<00:02:09.629> temperature<00:02:10.140> um

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
boiling in there at room temperature um

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.890 
boiling in there at room temperature um
just<00:02:11.069> just<00:02:11.129> by<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.640> strength<00:02:12.239> of<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.480> vacuum

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
just just by the strength of the vacuum

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.520 
just just by the strength of the vacuum
that<00:02:13.080> goes

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
that goes

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.199 
that goes
so<00:02:13.800> that's<00:02:13.950> pretty<00:02:14.160> neat<00:02:14.520> then<00:02:14.880> once<00:02:15.090> the

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
so that's pretty neat then once the

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.030 
so that's pretty neat then once the
cycle<00:02:15.360> is<00:02:15.540> done<00:02:15.720> it<00:02:15.930> seals<00:02:16.290> up<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.590> bag<00:02:16.770> and

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
cycle is done it seals up the bag and

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.100 
cycle is done it seals up the bag and
then<00:02:17.280> it<00:02:17.730> releases<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.420> vacuum<00:02:18.600> and<00:02:18.959> what

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
then it releases the vacuum and what

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.710 
then it releases the vacuum and what
that<00:02:19.260> does<00:02:19.500> is<00:02:19.770> it<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.850> looks<00:02:21.150> like<00:02:21.240> it<00:02:21.480> sucks

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
that does is it it looks like it sucks

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.980 
that does is it it looks like it sucks
the<00:02:21.900> era<00:02:22.110> in<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.530> process<00:02:22.950> it<00:02:23.100> sucks<00:02:23.370> all<00:02:23.640> the

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
the era in the process it sucks all the

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.300 
the era in the process it sucks all the
space<00:02:24.990> you<00:02:25.440> know<00:02:25.560> out<00:02:25.709> of<00:02:25.740> it<00:02:25.920> because<00:02:26.069> the<00:02:26.160> air

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
space you know out of it because the air

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.370 
space you know out of it because the air
is<00:02:26.430> already<00:02:26.700> removed<00:02:27.120> but<00:02:27.450> when<00:02:27.870> it<00:02:27.959> equalizes

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
is already removed but when it equalizes

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.350 
is already removed but when it equalizes
it<00:02:28.709> basically<00:02:29.010> it<00:02:29.400> shrinks<00:02:29.760> it<00:02:29.819> up<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.120> it's<00:02:30.239> a

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
it basically it shrinks it up and it's a

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.510 
it basically it shrinks it up and it's a
pretty<00:02:30.569> cool<00:02:30.660> whole<00:02:31.290> process<00:02:31.830> now<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.340> big

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
pretty cool whole process now the big

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.770 
pretty cool whole process now the big
advantage<00:02:32.910> of<00:02:33.030> doing<00:02:33.150> this<00:02:33.330> when<00:02:33.510> you<00:02:33.569> have<00:02:33.750> a

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
advantage of doing this when you have a

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.559 
advantage of doing this when you have a
liquid<00:02:34.110> is<00:02:34.470> that<00:02:35.250> you<00:02:35.520> can<00:02:35.790> do<00:02:36.390> different

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
liquid is that you can do different

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.180 
liquid is that you can do different
stuff<00:02:36.870> like<00:02:37.050> say<00:02:37.380> you<00:02:37.440> wanna<00:02:37.680> do<00:02:37.770> a<00:02:37.800> marinade

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
stuff like say you wanna do a marinade

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.130 
stuff like say you wanna do a marinade
so<00:02:38.430> let's<00:02:39.000> say<00:02:39.150> you<00:02:39.209> get<00:02:39.420> put<00:02:39.630> some<00:02:39.750> chicken<00:02:40.050> in

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
so let's say you get put some chicken in

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.360 
so let's say you get put some chicken in
go<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:40.500> put<00:02:40.680> it<00:02:40.709> in<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:40.890> bag

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
go to put it in the bag

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.040 
go to put it in the bag
you<00:02:41.580> can<00:02:41.700> put<00:02:41.819> the<00:02:41.910> marinade<00:02:42.239> in<00:02:42.420> there<00:02:42.480> seal

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
you can put the marinade in there seal

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.420 
you can put the marinade in there seal
it<00:02:43.230> up<00:02:43.319> and<00:02:43.530> then<00:02:43.890> you<00:02:44.040> know<00:02:44.130> get<00:02:44.280> it<00:02:44.370> all

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
it up and then you know get it all

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.650 
it up and then you know get it all
squinched<00:02:44.730> up<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.090> just<00:02:45.180> put<00:02:45.360> it<00:02:45.450> in<00:02:45.540> the

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
squinched up and just put it in the

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:46.580 
squinched up and just put it in the
fridge<00:02:45.840> you<00:02:46.019> have<00:02:46.170> to<00:02:46.230> worry<00:02:46.350> about<00:02:46.440> it

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
fridge you have to worry about it

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.650 
fridge you have to worry about it
because<00:02:46.680> it's<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:47.010> seal<00:02:47.250> I<00:02:47.459> use<00:02:47.850> if<00:02:48.060> lock<00:02:48.239> bags<00:02:48.480> a

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
because it's a seal I use if lock bags a

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.270 
because it's a seal I use if lock bags a
lot<00:02:48.690> for<00:02:49.050> that<00:02:49.080> and<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.709> advantage<00:02:50.070> of<00:02:50.130> this

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
lot for that and the advantage of this

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.620 
lot for that and the advantage of this
is<00:02:50.550> you<00:02:50.730> not<00:02:50.820> to<00:02:50.940> worry<00:02:51.060> about<00:02:51.090> that<00:02:51.300> zipped

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
is you not to worry about that zipped

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.960 
is you not to worry about that zipped
giving<00:02:52.260> away<00:02:52.470> you<00:02:52.860> know<00:02:52.980> you<00:02:53.580> know<00:02:53.640> that<00:02:53.790> make

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
giving away you know you know that make

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.910 
giving away you know you know that make
a<00:02:54.000> huge<00:02:54.209> mess<00:02:54.480> in<00:02:54.510> your<00:02:54.780> fridge<00:02:55.019> also<00:02:55.620> he's<00:02:55.739> bag

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
a huge mess in your fridge also he's bag

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.350 
a huge mess in your fridge also he's bag
you're<00:02:56.100> cheaper<00:02:56.430> than<00:02:56.550> Ziploc<00:02:56.910> bags<00:02:57.150> which<00:02:57.330> is

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
you're cheaper than Ziploc bags which is

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.420 
you're cheaper than Ziploc bags which is
pretty<00:02:57.900> cool<00:02:58.200> same<00:02:58.800> thing<00:02:58.950> you<00:02:59.040> can<00:02:59.160> do<00:02:59.250> with<00:02:59.400> a

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
pretty cool same thing you can do with a

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.520 
pretty cool same thing you can do with a
brine<00:02:59.730> um<00:03:00.060> you<00:03:00.660> know<00:03:00.750> you<00:03:00.810> just<00:03:01.050> put<00:03:01.260> put<00:03:01.410> that

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
brine um you know you just put put that

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.440 
brine um you know you just put put that
in<00:03:01.650> make<00:03:01.830> up<00:03:01.950> a<00:03:02.010> brine<00:03:02.280> pour<00:03:02.670> it<00:03:02.760> into<00:03:03.030> whatever

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
in make up a brine pour it into whatever

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.300 
in make up a brine pour it into whatever
you're<00:03:03.720> making<00:03:03.870> and<00:03:04.260> that's<00:03:04.800> great<00:03:05.100> and

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
you're making and that's great and

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.500 
you're making and that's great and
what's<00:03:05.459> great<00:03:05.550> Z's<00:03:05.790> are<00:03:05.880> all<00:03:06.030> pretty<00:03:06.269> sanitary

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
what's great Z's are all pretty sanitary

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.020 
what's great Z's are all pretty sanitary
so<00:03:06.959> once<00:03:07.230> you<00:03:07.610> you<00:03:08.610> know<00:03:08.700> once<00:03:08.819> you<00:03:08.880> get

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
so once you you know once you get

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.640 
so once you you know once you get
everything<00:03:09.180> all<00:03:09.480> in<00:03:09.510> there<00:03:09.870> sealed<00:03:10.260> up<00:03:10.440> wash

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
everything all in there sealed up wash

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.630 
everything all in there sealed up wash
your<00:03:10.860> hands<00:03:11.069> you<00:03:11.190> have<00:03:11.340> to<00:03:11.400> worry<00:03:11.550> about

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
your hands you have to worry about

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.759 
your hands you have to worry about
cross-contamination<00:03:12.540> quite<00:03:12.870> as<00:03:12.989> much<00:03:13.170> as<00:03:13.380> you

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
cross-contamination quite as much as you

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.559 
cross-contamination quite as much as you
would<00:03:13.970> otherwise<00:03:14.970> because<00:03:15.360> you're<00:03:15.480> not

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
would otherwise because you're not

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.710 
would otherwise because you're not
handling<00:03:16.050> you<00:03:16.739> know<00:03:16.830> a<00:03:16.860> container<00:03:17.430> of

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
handling you know a container of

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.330 
handling you know a container of
marinade<00:03:18.720> it's<00:03:18.930> not<00:03:19.079> sitting<00:03:19.440> in<00:03:19.560> open<00:03:20.070> in<00:03:20.190> the

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
marinade it's not sitting in open in the

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.130 
marinade it's not sitting in open in the
fridge<00:03:20.579> or<00:03:20.700> anything<00:03:20.820> like<00:03:20.970> that<00:03:21.030> and<00:03:22.019> also

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
fridge or anything like that and also

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.330 
fridge or anything like that and also
you<00:03:22.320> can<00:03:22.440> do<00:03:22.500> it<00:03:22.530> with<00:03:22.709> sous-vide<00:03:22.980> that's<00:03:23.220> what

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
you can do it with sous-vide that's what

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.069 
you can do it with sous-vide that's what
I've<00:03:23.430> been<00:03:23.459> doing<00:03:23.610> a<00:03:23.820> lot<00:03:23.910> of<00:03:23.970> stuff<00:03:24.209> with<00:03:24.390> you

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
I've been doing a lot of stuff with you

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.120 
I've been doing a lot of stuff with you
can<00:03:25.200> put<00:03:25.350> something<00:03:25.530> in<00:03:25.739> there<00:03:25.860> put<00:03:26.040> a<00:03:26.070> little

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
can put something in there put a little

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.530 
can put something in there put a little
bit<00:03:26.430> of<00:03:26.549> butter<00:03:26.700> in<00:03:26.790> there<00:03:26.940> if<00:03:27.209> you<00:03:27.299> want<00:03:27.450> to

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
bit of butter in there if you want to

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.449 
bit of butter in there if you want to
put<00:03:27.870> in<00:03:27.989> a<00:03:28.079> little<00:03:28.200> whatever<00:03:28.829> sauce<00:03:29.100> you<00:03:29.310> want

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
put in a little whatever sauce you want

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.940 
put in a little whatever sauce you want
and<00:03:30.329> then<00:03:30.420> cook<00:03:30.660> it<00:03:30.690> in<00:03:30.900> water<00:03:31.530> maybe<00:03:31.769> you'll

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
and then cook it in water maybe you'll

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:32.990 
and then cook it in water maybe you'll
show<00:03:32.070> you<00:03:32.130> a<00:03:32.190> little<00:03:32.280> bit<00:03:32.370> of<00:03:32.519> that<00:03:32.610> another

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
show you a little bit of that another

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.940 
show you a little bit of that another
video<00:03:33.180> so<00:03:33.570> lots<00:03:34.110> of<00:03:34.230> cool<00:03:34.380> things<00:03:34.590> you<00:03:34.650> can<00:03:34.709> do

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
video so lots of cool things you can do

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.530 
video so lots of cool things you can do
with<00:03:35.130> this<00:03:35.250> but<00:03:35.850> probably<00:03:35.970> one<00:03:36.269> of<00:03:36.299> the<00:03:36.420> big

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
with this but probably one of the big

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.990 
with this but probably one of the big
advantages<00:03:37.110> is<00:03:37.350> that<00:03:37.650> it's<00:03:37.890> a<00:03:38.100> higher-quality

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
advantages is that it's a higher-quality

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.300 
advantages is that it's a higher-quality
pump<00:03:39.570> so<00:03:39.780> the<00:03:40.230> pump<00:03:40.440> is<00:03:40.560> going<00:03:40.709> to<00:03:40.769> keep

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
pump so the pump is going to keep

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.210 
pump so the pump is going to keep
working<00:03:41.610> longer<00:03:42.269> than<00:03:42.420> typical<00:03:43.010> and<00:03:44.010> you<00:03:44.100> can

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
working longer than typical and you can

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.370 
working longer than typical and you can
also<00:03:44.370> put<00:03:44.640> everything<00:03:44.959> inside<00:03:45.959> of<00:03:46.019> it<00:03:46.200> and<00:03:46.320> do

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
also put everything inside of it and do

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.660 
also put everything inside of it and do
liquids<00:03:46.739> and<00:03:46.859> all<00:03:46.950> that<00:03:47.130> the<00:03:47.519> one

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
liquids and all that the one

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.370 
liquids and all that the one
disadvantage<00:03:48.030> is<00:03:48.420> everything<00:03:49.049> you<00:03:49.140> want<00:03:49.320> a

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
disadvantage is everything you want a

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.349 
disadvantage is everything you want a
vacuum<00:03:49.530> pack<00:03:49.890> has<00:03:50.160> to<00:03:50.370> fit<00:03:50.549> in<00:03:50.670> the<00:03:50.790> chamber<00:03:51.150> so

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
vacuum pack has to fit in the chamber so

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.539 
vacuum pack has to fit in the chamber so
the<00:03:51.930> size<00:03:52.230> of<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:52.500> Machine<00:03:52.920> does<00:03:53.220> matter

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
the size of the Machine does matter

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.940 
the size of the Machine does matter
because<00:03:54.150> um<00:03:54.420> you<00:03:55.140> know<00:03:55.230> if<00:03:55.290> you<00:03:55.350> want<00:03:55.560> to<00:03:55.709> do

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
because um you know if you want to do

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.640 
because um you know if you want to do
some<00:03:56.220> big<00:03:57.120> hunk<00:03:57.480> of<00:03:57.600> meat<00:03:57.810> or<00:03:58.200> something<00:03:58.530> like

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
some big hunk of meat or something like

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.560 
some big hunk of meat or something like
that<00:03:58.709> if<00:03:59.070> it's<00:03:59.519> not<00:03:59.640> going<00:03:59.790> to<00:03:59.880> fit<00:04:00.120> inside<00:04:00.510> of

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
that if it's not going to fit inside of

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.080 
that if it's not going to fit inside of
a<00:04:00.750> bag<00:04:00.959> that<00:04:00.989> fits<00:04:01.380> inside<00:04:01.560> of<00:04:01.799> your<00:04:02.220> chamber

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
a bag that fits inside of your chamber

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.849 
a bag that fits inside of your chamber
it's<00:04:03.329> not<00:04:03.630> going<00:04:03.810> to<00:04:03.870> work<00:04:04.019> we're<00:04:04.560> here<00:04:04.769> if

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
it's not going to work we're here if

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:07.009 
it's not going to work we're here if
you're<00:04:04.980> using<00:04:05.269> you<00:04:06.269> know<00:04:06.359> like<00:04:06.540> a<00:04:06.570> you<00:04:06.930> know

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
you're using you know like a you know

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:08.780 
you're using you know like a you know
food<00:04:07.230> saver<00:04:07.560> and<00:04:08.040> let's<00:04:08.220> say<00:04:08.310> you<00:04:08.370> got<00:04:08.489> a<00:04:08.549> big

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.320 
actually create your bag as long as you
want<00:04:22.710> you<00:04:23.280> can<00:04:23.400> accommodate<00:04:23.700> anything<00:04:24.240> you

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
want you can accommodate anything you

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.420 
want you can accommodate anything you
want<00:04:24.570> size<00:04:25.470> so<00:04:25.620> that's<00:04:25.740> one<00:04:25.919> advantage<00:04:26.070> that

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
want size so that's one advantage that

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.540 
want size so that's one advantage that
the<00:04:26.849> the<00:04:27.150> extreme

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
the the extreme

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.339 
the the extreme
Ones<00:04:27.729> have<00:04:27.909> over<00:04:28.360> you<00:04:28.750> know<00:04:28.840> the<00:04:28.990> chamber

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:29.349 
Ones have over you know the chamber

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:31.200 
Ones have over you know the chamber
style<00:04:29.590> you<00:04:29.680> just<00:04:29.830> have<00:04:29.919> to<00:04:30.009> realize<00:04:30.370> the

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
style you just have to realize the

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.670 
style you just have to realize the
limitations<00:04:31.599> and<00:04:31.930> just<00:04:32.139> know<00:04:32.259> that<00:04:32.289> if<00:04:32.500> you

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
limitations and just know that if you

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.409 
limitations and just know that if you
are<00:04:32.710> gonna<00:04:33.039> buy<00:04:33.639> one<00:04:33.879> just<00:04:34.090> make<00:04:34.180> sure<00:04:34.300> it's

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
are gonna buy one just make sure it's

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:35.460 
are gonna buy one just make sure it's
going<00:04:34.509> to<00:04:34.569> fit<00:04:34.659> you<00:04:34.930> know<00:04:35.020> for<00:04:35.169> your<00:04:35.259> typical

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
going to fit you know for your typical

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.770 
going to fit you know for your typical
purposes<00:04:36.460> so<00:04:36.879> that<00:04:36.909> that<00:04:37.300> works<00:04:37.479> really<00:04:37.690> well

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
purposes so that that works really well

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.950 
purposes so that that works really well
now<00:04:38.349> the<00:04:38.409> VP<00:04:38.680> 2:15<00:04:39.610> one<00:04:40.240> thing<00:04:40.419> it<00:04:40.539> has<00:04:40.569> over

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
now the VP 2:15 one thing it has over

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.510 
now the VP 2:15 one thing it has over
some<00:04:41.139> of<00:04:41.229> the<00:04:41.289> other<00:04:41.409> chamber<00:04:41.800> sealers<00:04:42.129> it<00:04:42.310> has

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
some of the other chamber sealers it has

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.580 
some of the other chamber sealers it has
an<00:04:42.669> oil<00:04:42.879> pump<00:04:43.180> and<00:04:43.449> the<00:04:43.900> big<00:04:44.050> advantage<00:04:44.470> of

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
an oil pump and the big advantage of

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.050 
an oil pump and the big advantage of
this<00:04:44.740> is<00:04:45.009> the<00:04:45.190> oil<00:04:45.310> pump<00:04:45.460> is<00:04:45.639> going<00:04:45.819> to<00:04:45.879> last

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
this is the oil pump is going to last

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.700 
this is the oil pump is going to last
longer<00:04:46.360> it's<00:04:46.659> a<00:04:46.720> better<00:04:46.960> pump<00:04:47.319> it's<00:04:47.470> a<00:04:47.530> higher

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
longer it's a better pump it's a higher

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.950 
longer it's a better pump it's a higher
quality<00:04:48.190> pump<00:04:48.430> and<00:04:48.639> what<00:04:49.479> will<00:04:49.569> happen<00:04:49.840> with

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
quality pump and what will happen with

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.619 
quality pump and what will happen with
the<00:04:50.080> other<00:04:50.259> style<00:04:50.620> pumps<00:04:50.919> is<00:04:51.039> over<00:04:51.310> time

00:04:51.619 --> 00:04:51.629 
the other style pumps is over time

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:53.820 
the other style pumps is over time
you'll<00:04:52.629> probably<00:04:52.659> start<00:04:53.080> losing<00:04:53.500> its<00:04:53.620> ability

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
you'll probably start losing its ability

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.040 
you'll probably start losing its ability
to<00:04:54.039> really<00:04:54.340> pull<00:04:54.550> a<00:04:54.580> vacuum<00:04:54.819> so<00:04:55.599> it'll<00:04:55.750> have<00:04:55.900> to

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
to really pull a vacuum so it'll have to

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.809 
to really pull a vacuum so it'll have to
go<00:04:56.080> longer<00:04:56.650> or<00:04:57.039> maybe<00:04:57.190> you<00:04:57.310> can't<00:04:57.520> get<00:04:57.639> as

00:04:57.809 --> 00:04:57.819 
go longer or maybe you can't get as

00:04:57.819 --> 00:04:59.520 
go longer or maybe you can't get as
strong<00:04:58.270> as<00:04:58.629> a<00:04:58.659> vacuum<00:04:59.110> as<00:04:59.229> it<00:04:59.349> would<00:04:59.500> otherwise

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
strong as a vacuum as it would otherwise

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.649 
strong as a vacuum as it would otherwise
and<00:05:00.250> you're<00:05:00.940> like<00:05:01.060> I<00:05:01.150> said<00:05:01.300> it's<00:05:01.419> strong

00:05:01.649 --> 00:05:01.659 
and you're like I said it's strong

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:04.110 
and you're like I said it's strong
enough<00:05:01.690> to<00:05:01.870> make<00:05:02.199> things<00:05:02.889> boil<00:05:03.219> you<00:05:03.699> know<00:05:03.819> at

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
enough to make things boil you know at

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.850 
enough to make things boil you know at
room<00:05:04.300> temperature<00:05:04.780> so<00:05:04.960> it<00:05:05.319> has<00:05:05.469> a<00:05:05.500> real<00:05:05.770> strong

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
room temperature so it has a real strong

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.189 
room temperature so it has a real strong
vacuum<00:05:06.219> on<00:05:06.580> it<00:05:06.699> also<00:05:06.969> has<00:05:07.150> a<00:05:07.180> little<00:05:07.449> gauge<00:05:07.960> on

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:08.199 
vacuum on it also has a little gauge on

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:09.839 
vacuum on it also has a little gauge on
it<00:05:08.289> too<00:05:08.440> which<00:05:08.979> is<00:05:09.099> pretty<00:05:09.280> cool<00:05:09.520> so<00:05:09.669> you<00:05:09.759> can

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:09.849 
it too which is pretty cool so you can

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:11.249 
it too which is pretty cool so you can
tell<00:05:10.000> how<00:05:10.120> strong<00:05:10.180> a<00:05:10.419> vacuum<00:05:10.900> you're<00:05:11.020> getting

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:11.259 
tell how strong a vacuum you're getting

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:13.559 
tell how strong a vacuum you're getting
on<00:05:11.379> it<00:05:11.500> on<00:05:11.889> this<00:05:12.129> particular<00:05:12.280> model<00:05:12.789> has<00:05:12.909> to<00:05:13.270> UM

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:13.569 
on it on this particular model has to UM

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:16.860 
on it on this particular model has to UM
to<00:05:14.500> heat<00:05:14.800> tape<00:05:15.460> things<00:05:15.909> so<00:05:16.120> to<00:05:16.180> wires<00:05:16.539> so<00:05:16.810> you

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
to heat tape things so to wires so you

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.140 
to heat tape things so to wires so you
can<00:05:17.020> get<00:05:17.139> double<00:05:17.469> seal<00:05:17.710> automatically<00:05:18.699> on<00:05:18.969> all

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
can get double seal automatically on all

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.879 
can get double seal automatically on all
of<00:05:19.270> your<00:05:19.389> bags<00:05:19.539> which<00:05:19.780> is<00:05:19.900> really<00:05:20.169> nice<00:05:20.319> but

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:20.889 
of your bags which is really nice but

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:22.320 
of your bags which is really nice but
anyways<00:05:21.129> getting<00:05:21.219> back<00:05:21.400> to<00:05:21.520> the<00:05:21.610> oil<00:05:21.639> part<00:05:22.210> of

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
anyways getting back to the oil part of

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.749 
anyways getting back to the oil part of
this<00:05:22.419> the<00:05:23.229> advantage<00:05:23.590> is<00:05:23.800> the<00:05:24.340> pump<00:05:24.520> is<00:05:24.639> going

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:24.759 
this the advantage is the pump is going

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:26.790 
this the advantage is the pump is going
to<00:05:24.819> last<00:05:25.030> longer<00:05:25.300> it's<00:05:25.780> gonna<00:05:25.990> it's<00:05:26.560> going<00:05:26.740> to

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
to last longer it's gonna it's going to

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.219 
to last longer it's gonna it's going to
pull<00:05:27.009> a<00:05:27.039> better<00:05:27.280> vacuum<00:05:27.550> longer<00:05:28.419> where<00:05:28.629> the

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:29.229 
pull a better vacuum longer where the

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:30.180 
pull a better vacuum longer where the
other<00:05:29.349> ones<00:05:29.500> are<00:05:29.560> going<00:05:29.650> to<00:05:29.740> get<00:05:29.830> weaker<00:05:30.159> over

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
other ones are going to get weaker over

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.680 
other ones are going to get weaker over
time<00:05:30.520> the<00:05:30.669> one<00:05:30.819> downside<00:05:31.210> is<00:05:31.330> you<00:05:31.419> got<00:05:31.539> some

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
time the one downside is you got some

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:32.610 
time the one downside is you got some
maintenance<00:05:32.020> involved<00:05:32.319> you're<00:05:32.409> gonna<00:05:32.500> have

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
maintenance involved you're gonna have

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.559 
maintenance involved you're gonna have
to<00:05:32.710> replace<00:05:33.279> the<00:05:33.460> oil<00:05:33.490> every<00:05:33.969> once<00:05:34.300> in<00:05:34.419> a<00:05:34.509> while

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:34.569 
to replace the oil every once in a while

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:36.330 
to replace the oil every once in a while
but<00:05:35.229> that's<00:05:35.380> kind<00:05:35.529> of<00:05:35.560> a<00:05:35.680> small<00:05:35.770> price<00:05:36.159> to<00:05:36.190> pay

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
but that's kind of a small price to pay

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.100 
but that's kind of a small price to pay
you<00:05:36.550> know<00:05:36.849> to<00:05:37.000> have<00:05:37.120> a<00:05:37.180> really<00:05:37.509> quality

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
you know to have a really quality

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.300 
you know to have a really quality
machine<00:05:38.229> that's<00:05:38.620> the<00:05:38.710> reason<00:05:38.889> why<00:05:39.009> and<00:05:39.190> it

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
machine that's the reason why and it

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.129 
machine that's the reason why and it
gained<00:05:39.490> the<00:05:39.580> 215<00:05:40.180> just<00:05:40.719> for<00:05:40.840> something<00:05:40.990> that

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:41.139 
gained the 215 just for something that

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:42.719 
gained the 215 just for something that
should<00:05:41.349> last<00:05:41.590> for<00:05:41.889> a<00:05:41.919> long<00:05:42.099> time<00:05:42.370> or<00:05:42.550> at<00:05:42.610> least

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:42.729 
should last for a long time or at least

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:44.370 
should last for a long time or at least
be<00:05:42.849> nice<00:05:42.969> and<00:05:43.180> durable<00:05:43.300> even<00:05:43.870> if<00:05:44.020> I<00:05:44.080> decide<00:05:44.349> to

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
be nice and durable even if I decide to
