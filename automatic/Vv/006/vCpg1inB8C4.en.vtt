 I had a problem with virtual yesterday. 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.109

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.369
 cell phone made cute, but when it 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.140
 connect to the internet I did not have 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.559
 internet had no network was not 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.660
 sharing the internet with me and then I 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.579
 I could not use it at all if you have 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.300

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:48.690
 You do it quickly and at last we're going 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.149
 there and my other mouse cursor for 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.399
 example when I can in the 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.640
 virtual the uterus they disappear 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.620
 introduced and has already disappeared but I will 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.710
 try to explain cute in a way 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.489
 more sure so you guys will get lost 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.930
 beauty 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.790
 so let's not go here and it was neither 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.710
 name you will create for you by 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.450
 example putting vinicius here for 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.140
 look like my cell phone experience when 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:20.970
 click the beauty f here is the password 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:24.000
 so chose jattak beauty here goes 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.430
 be where you want to pull 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.070
 internet for example the tep link 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.680
 if you use the wifi it appeared and went here 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.509
 below if you use the network cable will 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.729
 network cable does not appear on the 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.560
 I know how it will come but I think 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.630
 another way for you to be quiet 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.350
 So you 're link here because the 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.829
 my notebook connected to the technician 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:50.520
 and here the amount of people you 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:53.790
 want to share this beauty network I 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.390
 I put 5 because there I just know what I 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.750
 I want 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.090

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.540
