I've had her battery is fine but for

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.990 
I've had her battery is fine but for
some<00:00:28.380> reason<00:00:28.710> my<00:00:28.830> battery<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.250> lasting<00:00:29.789> maybe

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
some reason my battery is lasting maybe

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.850 
some reason my battery is lasting maybe
maybe<00:00:30.990> two<00:00:31.349> hours<00:00:31.880> because<00:00:32.880> i've<00:00:32.969> been<00:00:33.000> using

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
maybe two hours because i've been using

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.479 
maybe two hours because i've been using
forty<00:00:34.860> percent<00:00:35.160> brightness<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:36.410> i've<00:00:37.410> been

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
forty percent brightness and i've been

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.760 
forty percent brightness and i've been
using<00:00:38.489> bluetooth<00:00:39.059> headphones<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.840> so<00:00:40.140> I've

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
using bluetooth headphones and so I've

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.490 
using bluetooth headphones and so I've
had<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.070> keep<00:00:41.340> one<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.579> these<00:00:41.730> handy<00:00:42.239> and

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
had to keep one of these handy and

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.040 
had to keep one of these handy and
basically<00:00:44.270> you<00:00:45.270> know<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.420> little<00:00:45.570> for<00:00:45.899> low

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
basically you know a little for low

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.930 
basically you know a little for low
lights<00:00:46.289> there<00:00:46.559> takes<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.129> while<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.430> charge<00:00:47.640> up

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
lights there takes a while to charge up

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.049 
lights there takes a while to charge up
but<00:00:48.629> it's<00:00:48.750> gotta<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.320> USB<00:00:49.770> out<00:00:50.190> pork<00:00:50.879> and

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
but it's gotta you it USB out pork and

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.959 
but it's gotta you it USB out pork and
so<00:00:51.559> you're<00:00:52.559> able<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.920> charge<00:00:53.280> things<00:00:53.579> with<00:00:53.789> it

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
so you're able to charge things with it

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.180 
so you're able to charge things with it
and<00:00:54.210> then<00:00:54.809> this<00:00:54.989> one<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.590> little<00:00:55.920> bit<00:00:56.039> more

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
and then this one is a little bit more

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.700 
and then this one is a little bit more
fancy<00:00:56.730> guess<00:00:57.420> your<00:00:57.570> little<00:00:57.660> blue<00:00:57.960> LED<00:00:58.440> lights

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
fancy guess your little blue LED lights

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.000 
fancy guess your little blue LED lights
right<00:00:58.920> there<00:00:59.160> for<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.969> it's<00:01:00.539> got<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:01.109> output

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
right there for and it's got to output

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.429 
right there for and it's got to output
and<00:01:04.400> and<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:05.580> basically<00:01:05.990> this<00:01:06.990> is<00:01:07.049> how<00:01:07.409> I

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
and and so basically this is how I

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.410 
and and so basically this is how I
basically<00:01:08.130> survive<00:01:08.520> in<00:01:08.700> New<00:01:08.820> York<00:01:09.000> City<00:01:09.150> with

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
basically survive in New York City with
