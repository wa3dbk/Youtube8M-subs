00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:06.370
 good youtube patients today the 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:10.140
 I extract a tutorial to solve your 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:13.920
 microphone problem with windows 7 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.530
 Well the program is for you to create a 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.500
 driver 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.720
 or make a new sound driver in your 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.090
 computer 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.570
 whether you have your microphone and not 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.780
 you detect it here in 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.160
 the optional speaker 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.020
 They do not leave anything here 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.510
 I get what I have installed 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.899
 but to you nothing 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.149
 well what we're going to do is go to the 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.510
 next page to download the 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:43.510
 Program 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.720
 the link will leave it in the building 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.180
 you go and download it regularly 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.590
 regular I do not download it because I already 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.990
 I have 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:04.220
 well once downloaded the program that 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:06.320
 this window or this executable will remain 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.700
 you what is what you are going to do this is the 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.700
 double click on run 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.500
 this tab will open and go to here 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:17.909
 and here he will tell you that if you want another 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.869
 version a newer version 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:25.130
 updated you give it ok if you want it or 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:29.420
 cancel in my case because I already have a 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:33.140
 good new version 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:36.080
 what we are going to do is go to this part 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:39.590
 of the program where it says multimedia audio 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:43.830
 tv what we are going to do is give it double 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:48.440
 click and open a page 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.440
 where will we download the driver 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.630
 what this page does is look for the 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:57.659
 most suitable driver for your computer 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.000
 here we give driver download 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.280
 Y 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.570
 that will look for the most prominent version 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:08.320
 for your computer you give here 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.320
 Double click 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.750
 and you select where you want it to be 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.720
 keeps the driver room 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.270
 Well I will not do it because I already have it 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:22.500
 you see it where you keep it 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.500
 once downloaded 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.520
 you will have the following winrar file 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.069
 what we are going to do is double click 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.370
 you feel without extracting anything we go again 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.000
 everything screams 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:46.930
 we search in all these programs where 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.109
 tell you be the one executed the 'set up' 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.709
 come on we give double click we hope to 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.709
 let it open 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.800
 it will move a little in extracting itself 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.310
 or open up 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.390
 good 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.100
 will start the installation 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.000
 what you have to wait for is that you 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.000
 configure whole 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.560
 let's wait for the configuration 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:26.980
 Once the program is open, it will tell you 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:30.109
 the interest you are going to give him next 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.150
 next next install I do not 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.830
 I will do because in my case it will be for 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.920
 remove it 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.349
 good 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.069
 you have next following install 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.069
 I will not do it 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:48.290
 once your program is installed 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:53.890
 will ask you to restart the computer 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.890
 after agreeing to leave raimi sera 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.030
 once back 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:02.170
 a window will be created as this is called 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:05.319
 hd dvd 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:09.290
 the program will open 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:13.010
 and I'd say it's an audio device 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:16.150
 well you do not move anything here just us 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:19.870
 let's check if you have already created 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:22.530
 the speaker accesses or you give 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.270
 right click 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.879
 recording devices 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:31.190
 and now this will come out all this 

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:33.380
 microphone included 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.110
 and everything you could have installed in 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:39.510
 your computer that is a device 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.780
 audio that I did not detect before 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.020
 we are going to give you here in micro funk 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.180
 properties 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.789
 levels 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.740
 and we will upload all the levels to 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:53.710
 to be heard louder and that's 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.690
 your choice 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.630
