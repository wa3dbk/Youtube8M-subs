00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 in the past months have become 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.029
 the cases of laid out poison baits 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.730
 amassed among dog owners is the 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.620
 fear last dealt with in Baden 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.750
 leobersdorf or pressbaum in today 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.370
 crazy about you shows a coach 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.680
 how to bring your dog to it 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.680
 to report poison bait to eat city 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.449
 It is the nightmare of every miracle 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.369
 owner's poison bait on the roadside and in 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.529
 Unfortunately, the cases have recently 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.140
 heaped there are really only 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.300
 Two ways to prevent your dog from it 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.149
 protect if alonso are 100 trainer 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.559
 in burkersdorf what can I do 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:42.960
 on the one hand probably biting and 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.550
 second possibility other possibility 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.649
 It would be about training to solve 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.559
 on the one hand, if my dog at the 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.289
 Leash on the way is to teach him 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:55.410
 Eating on the way to overflowing 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.280
 instead of recording it in x or before 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.120
 especially if you walk free with dogs 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.190
 on the way is to teach him that he 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.290
 the model when it has found and 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.850
 this apparatus machines just this 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.939
 combination of at least are 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.710
 extreme for eating and that's why i do 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.650
 because she just eats everything 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.450
 finds and it makes sense that 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.220
 I would be warned if they did that 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.810
 find that I can clear it away and 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.540
 that I too others 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.990
 can protect it if one 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.580
 poisoned of the flesh or something 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.130
 First, it is about found food 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.710
 to ignore so to walk over it 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.200
 the dog will be rewarded as soon as he agrees 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.850
 his owner is more interested in that 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.560
 leave something again higher quality 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.979
 So that, for example, the dry food 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.570
 in the daylight and then man 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.770
 still with cheese or with sausage for it 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.869
 paid the dog that right 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.439
 made the absolute body dish 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.329
 preferably 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:53.250
 yes, exactly our thought behind it is that 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.140
 you're just warm on the dog 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.750
 on the leash more and more so extreme 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.640
 look that pc's nose in everything 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.979
 possible places better on the way 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.509
 thinks you just relax 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.610
 Rewarded why they decided correctly 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.069
 In the next step, Lilly learns 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.690
 command to bark 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:13.490
 and finally the dog should be loud 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.490
 as soon as the food has been found 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:20.540
 picture world after initial hesitation 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.060
 understand how fast that's about it 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.950
 klicker supports it 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.020
 to learn our timing advantage the dogs 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.820
 that makes you faster if you get better 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.290
 can say what exactly the moment when the 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:34.210
 in the right place so the moment in which they 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.210
 have chosen but also without a click 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.620
 pattern poodle student melo and has already 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.870
 understood what his owner of him 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.030
 wants she has to instil that he 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.260
 Eating for him pays to eat 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.209
 Report to 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.209
 The ship's body barks in principle 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.700
 built up the rescue dog work is there 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.140
 it just so that the dog finds a person 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.660
 and the banded up underneath 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.250
 occurs and make a separate one 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.350
 finds the poison bait barks 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.610
 so long until the dog handler is the 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.190
 Dog is is the hardest 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.060
 build namely the greedy, the 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.310
 just for the course 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.390
 But the hardest thing to bring is on 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.640
 Anyway, it can almost say 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.500
 every dog learns to have it loud wiener 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.930
 a significant part of the 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.790
 poison bait prevention nothing with 100 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.160
 training but does affect 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.680
 only mutual consideration between 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.720
 Do not wonder today and expand so 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.640
 preventively so that then the fronts 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.860
 Do not harden them and thus more 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.350
 Gift be designed by people 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.830
 who are important that you consider 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:36.260
 take and for example how lax way edge 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.790
 go look at it just like you 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.950
 The dog does not have to wait any longer 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.360
 in the garden or in the flat world and 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.600
 the whole environment interferes with the 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.600
 volume
