00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 you remember when you made millions 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.620
 and millions of attack resources no 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:11.780
 not even me well because the came 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.780
 time to become millionaires 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.670
 we are all guys are dale needles e 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.740
 today we are here in this video where you 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.650
 I will illustrate a method for making not many 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.150
 resources a little more 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.980
 I state that I already knew this thing 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.380
 but I didn't want to make a video of it because 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.059
 I wanted a moment to experiment with me first 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.989
 it was said by the good cai then lo 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.120
 I thank 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.770
 the idea was to make a video together though 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.420
 then for a series of things we are not 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.579
 so here we are 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.129
 practically what happened in the new 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.780
 update have changed the criteria 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.940
 of match making 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.010
 in a nutshell if me or the town hall 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.070
 level 10 I can only find municipalities 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.520
 level 7 8 9 10 and therefore I can no longer 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.629
 find the municipalities level 5 4 3 2 1 6 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.329
 things like that 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.119
 and unfortunately you can no longer do 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.369
 troll attacks one type those that i 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.409
 I used to do a dragon a long time ago 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.420
 things like that against a village 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.369
 really not too much stuff though 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.259
 they can do more so we don't travel 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.330
 on spilled milk but let's talk about the 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.460
 great advantages of this thing 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.549
 what of this new day while that 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.540
 precisely changeling of trophies among the 800 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.700
 and 1,200 trophies you'll really find 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.950
 lots of resources on his ear and germs 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.540
 i was really all guys is not that 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.360
 will be like the master league of bo 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.159
 super mega villages max ati with santoro 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.930
 but you can't get it 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.509
 sparse villages, natives 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.640
 abandoned surveys we say better 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.159
 however strong the resources that can be 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.470
 take you will find practically anything 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.689
 but I guarantee you that tip tip type skip 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.090
 skip city after 10 village and that of 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.979
 a village attacking with 300 thousand violet 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.240
 and two hundred thousand elixirs that anyway 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.920
 they are not few 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.260
 of course you will sometimes get caught 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.470
 definitely mega inactive drugs 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:07.050
 how much with 500 thousand of gold 500,000 of 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.479
 leasing but obviously I don't find them 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.120
 because a million had found one 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.940
 then there was that update of 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.590
 Monday afternoon and lost replay 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.230
 oh well we don't talk about these things 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.300
 little brackets guys I swear to you 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.290
 I have never done so many resources 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.510
 in my life 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.330
 Oedipus in a week and a half done 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.160
 type 40 walls level 9 cost him a 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.870
 million to the wall so I have to say that 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.490
 besides the fact of doing so many 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.120
 resources I'm having fun too 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:38.490
 very much like mastiffs and hot air balloons 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.360
 acer barbarians the giant goals in a bit of 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.070
 all guys 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.630
 another thing you were meant to say for 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.150
 regarding the attacks you are 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.950
 seeing below in the background are 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.900
 attacks completely made at random though 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.240
 really got so many resources 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.220
 all more or less with more than 200,000 d 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.170
 gold 200 thousand of the idea therefore certain 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.660
 boys more than that what you want e 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.880
 I'm the proof that this guys 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.040
 and new paradise of clash of lance 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.090
 while while while the last thing that 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.790
 I wanted to tell you 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.190
 here is the fact that the bonus is very low 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.530
 but surely boys repay themselves firm 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.580
 all though because before no one was 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.170
 silver alloy was one thing 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.000
 practically unknown 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.070
 I really did a lot of resources 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.350
 already now I see that he is making of it 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.030
 less and probably after this video 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.040
 there will be even less then from what 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.019
 it will refound itself and in the end it will not 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.820
 will find more resources for or at least 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.590
 trust me now at the time of 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.570
 there are still so many resources 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.850
 because type there are all the inactive 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.550
 that they are left there have focused 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.410
 because losing more or less defenses 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.930
 one always remains around 1000 trophies 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.640
 and therefore before there were so many i 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.680
 low level municipalities that broke the 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.140
 boxes is now as if automatically 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.819
 clash jumped them and went to visit 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.799
 immediately 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.999
 maybe really a thing pica guys 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:54.409
 yes in this video I will have repeated type 

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:57.319
 352 times the same concepts 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:57.799
 however I recommend you go down that it is worth it 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:00.290
 the penalty 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:03.290
 so we were saying a new update 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.209
 new match making can be found villages 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.549
 of municipalities more similar and so yes 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:10.219
 they also find more resources and if you want 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:10.969
 make so many big money elixirs black and gold e 

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:12.889
 everything 

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:14.629
 go down around a thousand and one trophies 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:17.419
 obviously if you have the town hall level 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:19.099
 8 9 10 if you have inferior derivative vi 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:22.070
 I advise more or less to be among the 

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:23.930
 one thousand and 1,400 so by heart but 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.930
 trust that the municipalities level 7 is 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.759
 lower you won't have resource problems 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.009
 will start from a municipality level 9 but 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:33.320
 in this way we would not even have any more 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:35.210
 we simply then this video 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.009
 was a thousand thousand response 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.199
 questions why if in your large 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:41.150
 eyes what the pig silver teg does to us 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:42.229
 Executioner there are a mess of resources what 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.970
 I'm doing the ligament 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:46.400
 as usual I thank you for everything 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.080
 I recommend you continue so many that 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.150
 I like so many nice comments below 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.770
