 hi girls how are you how will you 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.830
 given by the title of the video this 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.660
 It's a collaboration with our friend 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.580
 scripts in the description of the video you 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.920
 I leave all the links to your channel and your 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.630
 video we both wanted to give you two options 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.400
 of hair and make-up that are you 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.770
 very very simple and of course very 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.539
 I'm going to start brushing my 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.090
 eyebrows to make up with a color 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.480
 dark brown coffee and thus frame the 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.480
 look 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.140
 after putting that shadow brush for 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:42.630
 that look more natural 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.790
 take a vanilla color clarito and what 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.800
 apply under the eyebrow and a little 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.489
 by the tear to highlight and give light 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.489
 to the eyes 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.700
 then I took a tone in one color 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.980
 slightly darker than my tone of 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.520
 skin and I put it down the basin so super 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.520
 softly 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.369
 if you are one of those who always fight with 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.799
 the outlined this is the ideal for you already 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.659
 It's super easy to do it with your 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.080
 pencil eyeliner of your favorite color 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.820
 Make your eyelash line pegadito not 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.890
 matter that it is not straight and if 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.930
 you like you can make a small wing in 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.330
 direction where you finish your eyebrows for 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.850
 lengthen your eyes a little with the help 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.409
 of a brush or a cotton swab diffuses 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.630
 this line so that we stay very 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.560
 soft and with the same pencil mark 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.560
 under your lashes 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.229
 to finish the eyes I put my masks 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.229
 favorites 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.290
 on my cheeks I put in my place 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.000
 favorite is a pastel pink and then 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.860
 I spent some dust to blend 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.170
 best 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.270
 to see more light in the eyes apply the 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.520
 same color vanilla using my finger 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.370
 cancel that will make you see more 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.340
 healthy and wakes up on the lips use 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.610
 this pink tone is in number 17 of 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.610
 visu 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.400
 and by the edges I put this color 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.170
 called terramar orchid so that it 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.770
 see a little different and much more 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.770
 striking 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.360
 at the end add another bit of the vissum 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.490
 so there's a nice transition and 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.880
 ready 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.880
 ah 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:49.170
 for the hairstyle let it be marked 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.849
 natural way the party and take a 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.340
 strand more or less at the height of my 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.519
 eyebrows and hold it with pins 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.519
 behind 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:02.700
 on the other side I took one at the same height 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.700
 and place it above the previous one 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:15.280
 applied a little bit specific to 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.280
 lower the flying horses and ready 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.760
