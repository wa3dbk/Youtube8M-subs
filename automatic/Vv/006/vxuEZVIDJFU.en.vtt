that<00:02:42.099> they're<00:02:42.250> not<00:02:42.400> releasing<00:02:42.819> on<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:44.470> shows

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
that they're not releasing on the shows

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.250 
that they're not releasing on the shows
anymore<00:02:45.310> or<00:02:45.909> at<00:02:46.030> least<00:02:46.209> that<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.629> smaller<00:02:46.900> big

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
anymore or at least that the smaller big

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.899 
anymore or at least that the smaller big
shows<00:02:47.500> like<00:02:47.709> a<00:02:47.739> helmet<00:02:48.099> cell<00:02:48.459> should<00:02:48.700> be<00:02:48.819> on

should have been money in the bank is
one<00:02:54.609> that<00:02:54.760> I<00:02:54.790> think<00:02:54.819> it<00:02:55.000> a<00:02:55.030> lot<00:02:55.269> of<00:02:55.359> people

released straight to a DVD um was for

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:01.740 
released straight to a DVD um was for
some<00:03:00.819> reason<00:03:01.090> that<00:03:01.209> the<00:03:01.269> pay<00:03:01.419> per<00:03:01.480> views

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
some reason that the pay per views

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.179 
some reason that the pay per views
aren't<00:03:01.930> selling<00:03:02.290> Billy<00:03:02.590> they<00:03:02.889> have<00:03:03.010> no

aren't selling Billy they have no

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:06.119 
aren't selling Billy they have no

BVD<00:03:06.639> stuff<00:03:06.849> like<00:03:07.030> this<00:03:07.180> that<00:03:07.239> that<00:03:07.689> always

sells<00:03:08.290> well<00:03:08.500> on<00:03:08.769> blu-ray<00:03:09.370> so<00:03:09.609> I<00:03:09.639> think<00:03:09.760> it

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:09.969 
sells well on blu-ray so I think it

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:11.909 
sells well on blu-ray so I think it
doesn't<00:03:10.480> come<00:03:10.930> over<00:03:11.109> well<00:03:11.260> if<00:03:11.439> I<00:03:11.530> just<00:03:11.739> at

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:11.919 
doesn't come over well if I just at

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:14.429 
doesn't come over well if I just at
three<00:03:12.129> hour<00:03:12.280> show<00:03:12.639> like<00:03:13.450> SummerSlam<00:03:13.959> here<00:03:14.200> so

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:14.439 
three hour show like SummerSlam here so

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:16.199 
three hour show like SummerSlam here so
maybe<00:03:14.709> that's<00:03:14.919> why<00:03:15.099> amazon's<00:03:15.729> trying<00:03:16.000> to<00:03:16.090> get

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
maybe that's why amazon's trying to get

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.289 
maybe that's why amazon's trying to get
rid<00:03:16.359> of<00:03:16.389> their<00:03:16.690> wrestling<00:03:17.620> releases<00:03:18.220> to<00:03:19.090> try
