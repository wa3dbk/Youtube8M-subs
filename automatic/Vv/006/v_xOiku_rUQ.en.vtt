basically you've got your two pieces
here<00:01:04.369> this<00:01:04.789> actual<00:01:05.689> chain<00:01:06.069> glider<00:01:07.069> comes

00:01:07.419 --> 00:01:07.429 
here this actual chain glider comes

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:09.249 
here this actual chain glider comes
apart<00:01:07.819> it<00:01:07.970> cracks<00:01:08.210> apart<00:01:08.539> it<00:01:08.690> has<00:01:08.810> a<00:01:08.840> clipping

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
here again and what we're going to do is

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.639 
here again and what we're going to do is
going<00:01:52.520> to<00:01:52.610> try<00:01:52.789> and<00:01:53.110> in<00:01:54.110> here<00:01:54.380> we're<00:01:54.500> going<00:01:54.590> to

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
going to try and in here we're going to

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:56.440 
going to try and in here we're going to
slot<00:01:54.920> it<00:01:55.039> now<00:01:55.190> it's<00:01:55.729> important<00:01:56.210> when<00:01:56.360> you're

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
slot it now it's important when you're

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.389 
slot it now it's important when you're
installing<00:01:56.929> is<00:01:57.259> to<00:01:57.409> actually<00:01:57.740> use<00:01:57.890> a<00:01:57.920> proper

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
installing is to actually use a proper

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.359 
installing is to actually use a proper
lubricant<00:01:58.909> inside<00:01:59.360> here<00:01:59.960> so<00:02:00.560> it<00:02:00.710> does<00:02:00.920> freely

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
lubricant inside here so it does freely

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.520 
lubricant inside here so it does freely
glide<00:02:01.909> inside<00:02:02.330> the<00:02:02.509> chain<00:02:02.750> case<00:02:03.050> the<00:02:03.259> heebie

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
glide inside the chain case the heebie

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.910 
glide inside the chain case the heebie
chain<00:02:03.800> case<00:02:04.069> so<00:02:04.909> here<00:02:05.300> we're<00:02:05.420> going<00:02:05.539> to<00:02:05.659> just

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
chain case so here we're going to just

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:17.940 
chain case so here we're going to just
line<00:02:06.920> these<00:02:07.100> up<00:02:07.159> like<00:02:07.520> this<00:02:15.610> basically<00:02:16.610> the

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
line these up like this basically the

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:33.849 
line these up like this basically the
whole<00:02:18.950> setup<00:02:19.250> snaps<00:02:19.640> together<00:02:19.970> like<00:02:20.420> so

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:33.859 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:36.140 

let's<00:02:34.859> go<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.010> line<00:02:35.219> them<00:02:35.400> up<00:02:35.489> line<00:02:35.909> up<00:02:36.060> a

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
let's go to line them up line up a

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:52.250 
let's go to line them up line up a
little<00:02:36.180> teeth

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.550 

here<00:02:53.290> snapping<00:02:53.920> into<00:02:54.040> position<00:02:54.489> here<00:02:54.730> and

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
here snapping into position here and

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.780 
here snapping into position here and
just<00:02:56.560> on<00:02:56.709> the<00:02:56.800> last<00:02:57.040> one<00:02:57.250> on<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:57.430> bottom<00:02:57.640> here

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
just on the last one on the bottom here

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.860 
just on the last one on the bottom here
just<00:02:58.860> a<00:02:59.860> matter<00:03:00.069> of<00:03:00.160> lining<00:03:00.459> it<00:03:00.730> all<00:03:00.819> up<00:03:01.030> like

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
just a matter of lining it all up like

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.680 
just a matter of lining it all up like
so<00:03:02.730> too

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.080 
you can see here now what I've noticed
is<00:03:24.840> well<00:03:25.050> I've<00:03:25.110> come<00:03:25.260> to<00:03:25.380> put<00:03:25.560> it<00:03:25.650> on<00:03:25.800> I<00:03:26.100> could

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
is well I've come to put it on I could

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.580 
is well I've come to put it on I could
have<00:03:27.180> cut<00:03:27.390> more<00:03:27.660> off<00:03:27.780> these<00:03:27.990> teeth<00:03:28.290> at<00:03:28.500> the

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
have cut more off these teeth at the

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.100 
have cut more off these teeth at the
back<00:03:28.770> which<00:03:29.490> is<00:03:29.640> not<00:03:29.790> a<00:03:29.820> problem<00:03:29.970> I've<00:03:30.630> already

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
back which is not a problem I've already

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.220 
back which is not a problem I've already
cut<00:03:31.350> about<00:03:31.650> an<00:03:31.800> inch<00:03:31.890> off<00:03:32.750> the<00:03:33.750> rear<00:03:33.960> section

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
cut about an inch off the rear section

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.440 
cut about an inch off the rear section
so<00:03:34.980> what<00:03:35.130> I'm<00:03:35.220> going<00:03:35.400> to<00:03:35.430> do<00:03:35.610> is<00:03:35.760> now<00:03:36.000> I'm<00:03:36.240> just

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
so what I'm going to do is now I'm just

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.780 
so what I'm going to do is now I'm just
going<00:03:36.600> to<00:03:36.630> see<00:03:37.260> there<00:03:37.410> it's<00:03:37.590> not<00:03:37.680> freeing<00:03:38.040> free

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
going to see there it's not freeing free

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.380 
going to see there it's not freeing free
spinning<00:03:39.060> very<00:03:39.270> well<00:03:39.450> let's<00:03:40.260> stop<00:03:40.500> this<00:03:41.390> I'm

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
spinning very well let's stop this I'm

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.820 
spinning very well let's stop this I'm
going<00:03:42.540> to<00:03:42.600> just<00:03:42.660> simply<00:03:43.020> just<00:03:43.290> crack<00:03:43.530> it<00:03:43.650> back

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
going to just simply just crack it back

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.860 
going to just simply just crack it back
open<00:03:44.010> again<00:03:46.910> so<00:03:47.910> it's<00:03:48.060> good<00:03:48.180> to<00:03:48.300> just<00:03:48.330> make

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
open again so it's good to just make

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.240 
open again so it's good to just make
sure<00:03:49.050> you<00:03:49.200> at<00:03:49.410> least<00:03:49.620> measure<00:03:49.890> but<00:03:50.130> it's

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
sure you at least measure but it's

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.560 
sure you at least measure but it's
probably<00:03:50.490> better<00:03:50.610> not<00:03:50.700> to<00:03:50.850> cut<00:03:51.060> too<00:03:51.090> much<00:03:51.270> off

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
probably better not to cut too much off

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.660 
probably better not to cut too much off
all<00:03:51.780> at<00:03:51.900> once<00:03:52.080> otherwise<00:03:52.860> you<00:03:53.280> just<00:03:53.310> end<00:03:53.550> up

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
all at once otherwise you just end up

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.040 
all at once otherwise you just end up
damaging<00:03:53.880> the<00:03:54.210> whole<00:03:54.360> chain<00:03:54.630> lighter<00:03:54.870> and<00:03:54.990> you

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
damaging the whole chain lighter and you

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.190 
damaging the whole chain lighter and you
got<00:03:55.170> to<00:03:55.230> buy<00:03:55.320> a<00:03:55.350> new<00:03:55.410> one<00:03:56.720> so<00:03:57.720> it<00:03:57.840> just<00:03:57.870> comes

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
got to buy a new one so it just comes

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.150 
got to buy a new one so it just comes
apart<00:03:58.590> like<00:03:58.650> so<00:03:59.390> just<00:04:00.390> crack<00:04:00.690> it<00:04:00.810> open<00:04:00.930> again

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
apart like so just crack it open again

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:07.580 
apart like so just crack it open again
and<00:04:02.160> this<00:04:02.760> will<00:04:02.910> just<00:04:03.120> separate<00:04:03.540> now<00:04:04.070> part<00:04:06.590> it

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
and this will just separate now part it

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.500 
and this will just separate now part it
comes<00:04:07.770> up<00:04:08.040> hang<00:04:08.520> this<00:04:08.640> up<00:04:08.700> here<00:04:09.030> you<00:04:09.330> have<00:04:09.480> a

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
comes up hang this up here you have a

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.470 
comes up hang this up here you have a
rear<00:04:09.900> part<00:04:10.200> take<00:04:11.190> this<00:04:11.280> off<00:04:11.460> again<00:04:11.730> it's<00:04:12.330> good

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
rear part take this off again it's good

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.610 
rear part take this off again it's good
to<00:04:12.600> probably<00:04:12.900> just<00:04:13.020> put<00:04:13.170> these<00:04:13.260> back<00:04:13.500> together

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
to probably just put these back together

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.810 
to probably just put these back together
again<00:04:14.010> and<00:04:14.280> just<00:04:15.890> ensure<00:04:16.890> that<00:04:17.100> you've<00:04:17.520> got<00:04:17.730> it

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
again and just ensure that you've got it

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:18.950 
again and just ensure that you've got it
all<00:04:17.910> in<00:04:17.940> the<00:04:18.090> right<00:04:18.239> position<00:04:18.660> before<00:04:18.750> you

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:18.960 
all in the right position before you

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.570 
all in the right position before you
actually<00:04:19.110> go<00:04:19.380> chopping<00:04:19.860> again<00:04:20.130> and<00:04:20.280> chopping

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
actually go chopping again and chopping

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.740 
actually go chopping again and chopping
bits<00:04:20.790> off<00:04:20.940> it<00:04:21.120> and<00:04:22.970> what<00:04:23.970> I'll<00:04:24.090> do<00:04:24.240> now<00:04:24.450> is<00:04:24.480> I'll

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
bits off it and what I'll do now is I'll

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.570 
bits off it and what I'll do now is I'll
just<00:04:26.780> stop<00:04:27.780> the<00:04:27.930> camera<00:04:28.260> for<00:04:28.470> us<00:04:28.500> and<00:04:28.830> then<00:04:29.490> we

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
just stop the camera for us and then we

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.860 
just stop the camera for us and then we
can<00:04:29.730> come<00:04:29.940> back<00:04:30.090> and<00:04:30.270> we<00:04:30.360> can<00:04:30.450> have<00:04:30.600> a<00:04:30.630> look<00:04:30.750> at

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
can come back and we can have a look at

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.180 
can come back and we can have a look at
this<00:04:30.990> in<00:04:31.080> a<00:04:31.170> few<00:04:31.350> minutes<00:04:31.590> time<00:04:31.740> when<00:04:31.920> it<00:04:32.010> comes

not touch these plastic arms coming from

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.720 
not touch these plastic arms coming from
the<00:04:53.850> chain<00:04:54.090> glow<00:04:54.650> this<00:04:55.650> is<00:04:55.920> the<00:04:56.190> rear<00:04:56.430> section

which<00:04:57.090> you<00:04:57.210> have<00:04:57.330> to<00:04:57.450> make<00:04:57.600> sure<00:04:57.810> the<00:04:57.990> cutaway

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
which you have to make sure the cutaway

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.200 
which you have to make sure the cutaway
is<00:04:59.420> indented<00:05:00.420> and<00:05:00.840> goes<00:05:01.020> in<00:05:01.260> from<00:05:01.470> the<00:05:01.560> inside

is indented and goes in from the inside

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:20.320 
is indented and goes in from the inside
this

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.089 

there's<00:05:20.900> actually<00:05:21.199> some<00:05:21.380> little<00:05:21.620> grooves

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:22.099 
there's actually some little grooves

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:24.460 
there's actually some little grooves
here<00:05:22.430> and<00:05:23.270> this<00:05:23.449> plastic<00:05:24.050> section<00:05:24.259> will

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
here and this plastic section will

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.850 
here and this plastic section will
actually<00:05:24.740> sit<00:05:24.949> in<00:05:25.069> there<00:05:25.220> a<00:05:25.250> snug<00:05:25.580> that<00:05:26.509> spot

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.170 

that's<00:05:30.860> you<00:05:31.190> can<00:05:31.310> see<00:05:31.490> now<00:05:31.669> that<00:05:31.699> I<00:05:31.880> can<00:05:32.030> rotate

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
that's you can see now that I can rotate

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.930

the<00:05:32.509> crank<00:05:32.750> and<00:05:33.009> the<00:05:34.009> back<00:05:34.400> that<00:05:34.639> it'll<00:05:34.819> be

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
the crank and the back that it'll be

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.129 
the crank and the back that it'll be
even<00:05:35.060> more<00:05:35.180> supported<00:05:35.750> by<00:05:35.840> the<00:05:35.900> time<00:05:36.110> I

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:36.139 
even more supported by the time I

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:38.830 
even more supported by the time I
finished<00:05:36.560> putting<00:05:36.740> the<00:05:36.860> ribbon<00:05:37.220> on<00:05:37.840> ribbit
