I had three main jobs to get done one of

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.910 
I had three main jobs to get done one of
them<00:00:30.539> was<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.750> kill<00:00:31.019> switch<00:00:31.140> on<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.529> roll<00:00:31.679> cage

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
them was a kill switch on the roll cage

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.979 
them was a kill switch on the roll cage
it<00:00:32.189> shuts<00:00:32.460> all<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.910> power<00:00:33.149> down<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.690> smart

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
it shuts all the power down to the smart

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.180 
it shuts all the power down to the smart
wire<00:00:34.820> so<00:00:35.820> basically<00:00:36.329> made<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.230> mount<00:00:37.559> off<00:00:37.920> the

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
wire so basically made a mount off the

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.920 
wire so basically made a mount off the
roll<00:00:38.370> cage<00:00:38.579> oh<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.910> sheet<00:00:39.149> metal<00:00:39.300> tacked<00:00:39.780> it

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
roll cage oh the sheet metal tacked it

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.920 
roll cage oh the sheet metal tacked it
on<00:00:40.079> mounted<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.190> switch<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:41.879> Andre<00:00:42.180> can<00:00:42.570> wire

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
on mounted the switch so Andre can wire

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.979 
on mounted the switch so Andre can wire
in<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.230> plug<00:00:44.000> second<00:00:45.000> job<00:00:45.210> was<00:00:45.420> just<00:00:45.480> to

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
in the plug second job was just to

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.340 
in the plug second job was just to
secure<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.950> loom<00:00:47.160> over<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.760> water<00:00:47.969> pump<00:00:48.350> the

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.250 
secure the loom over the water pump the
water<00:00:49.469> pump<00:00:49.770> pulley<00:00:49.850> so<00:00:50.850> yeah<00:00:51.090> just<00:00:51.989> put<00:00:52.230> a

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
water pump pulley so yeah just put a

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.880 
water pump pulley so yeah just put a
little<00:00:52.440> alloy<00:00:53.070> sheet<00:00:53.550> metal<00:00:54.530> sheet<00:00:55.530> alloy

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
little alloy sheet metal sheet alloy

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.510 
little alloy sheet metal sheet alloy
mount<00:00:56.430> off<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:57.859> with<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.890> couple<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.340> plastic

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
mount off that with a couple of plastic

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.569 
mount off that with a couple of plastic
clips<00:00:59.940> so<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.210> worked<00:01:00.539> out<00:01:00.690> pretty<00:01:01.050> good<00:01:01.170> and

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
clips so that worked out pretty good and

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.969 
clips so that worked out pretty good and
then<00:01:02.579> also<00:01:03.180> finished<00:01:03.600> off<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.729> air<00:01:05.729> inlet<00:01:06.060> so

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
then also finished off the air inlet so

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.429 
then also finished off the air inlet so
had<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.010> few<00:01:08.310> modifications<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.720> make<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.260> my

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
had a few modifications to make to my

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.510 
had a few modifications to make to my
design<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.430> I've<00:01:11.729> finished<00:01:12.210> off<00:01:12.510> last<00:01:12.750> night

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
design that I've finished off last night

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.850 
design that I've finished off last night
yeah<00:01:14.520> basically<00:01:14.820> just<00:01:15.270> finished<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.780> up

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
yeah basically just finished that up

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.410 
yeah basically just finished that up
mounted<00:01:16.860> be<00:01:17.600> the<00:01:18.600> actual<00:01:18.960> thing<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.500> the

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
mounted be the actual thing to the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.800 
mounted be the actual thing to the
radiator<00:01:21.799> under<00:01:22.799> brace<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:24.030> just<00:01:24.270> tack<00:01:24.780> that

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
radiator under brace so just tack that

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.990 
radiator under brace so just tack that
on<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.500> yeah<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:26.430> think<00:01:26.640> that's<00:01:26.790> gonna<00:01:26.909> work

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
on and yeah I think that's gonna work

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.850 
on and yeah I think that's gonna work
pretty<00:01:27.360> well<00:01:27.479> it's<00:01:28.049> probably<00:01:28.380> something<00:01:28.590> that

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
pretty well it's probably something that

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.160 
pretty well it's probably something that
I'm<00:01:28.950> gonna<00:01:29.070> finish<00:01:29.369> off<00:01:29.640> later<00:01:29.880> on<00:01:30.150> but<00:01:30.420> it'll

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
I'm gonna finish off later on but it'll

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.109 
I'm gonna finish off later on but it'll
work<00:01:31.200> for<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.560> dyno<00:01:31.979> so<00:01:32.310> yeah<00:01:32.700> fingers

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
work for the dyno so yeah fingers

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.240 
work for the dyno so yeah fingers
crossed<00:01:33.150> tomorrow<00:01:33.780> we<00:01:33.990> can<00:01:34.170> hopefully<00:01:34.950> get
