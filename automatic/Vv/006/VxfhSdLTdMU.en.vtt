00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.650
 how about followers of writing today I'm going 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.400
 to prepare the 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.400
 for pesic 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.460
 150 grams of flour 250 grams of 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:24.250
 sugar a tablespoon well filled 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.190
 of yeast around 10 grams 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.880
 6 eggs that separated the whites from the 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:33.760
 buds then I have the mold then of 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.420
 about 26 centimeters that I no longer have 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.420
 pointed 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.430
 and for coverage a tablet of 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.770
 chocolate to melt and jam to the 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.800
 that the one you like for the filling 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:50.030
 let's start by assembling the whites to 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.620
 snow point 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.800
 and we already have the clear ones already mounted 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.010
 you know that the whites 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.980
 if we turn them over and they do not fall or 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.350
 I put a pinch of salt 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.750
 to mount them now then 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.309
 we will put the herbs together with the 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.140
 sugar 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.820
 if you want to put a little bit of 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.380
 lemon zest can also be 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.020
 put it gives very good flavor but very 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.149
 little while I have the oven 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.399
 that is preheating to 200 degrees 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:19.500
 so that when we have the dough made 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:22.640
 let's have it hot now 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.490
 we will beat the sugar by the yolks 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.430
 well we already have the yolks with sugar 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:32.190
 you see that there is a light and 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:34.320
 now what are the clear 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.870
 making enveloping movements of 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.500
 inside out do not miss us 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:44.159
 will and slowly we will mix and 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.499
 then we will add the flour 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.929
 we have already mixed some buds with 

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:50.929
 clear now we will put the flour in 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:57.880
 we will also put yeast 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.710
 we will go making we will mix little 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.470
 we will not put all the flour 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.210
 we will blow it slowly for 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.870
 that do not make lumps or anything and what 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.530
 we will be doing 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.360
 with the spatula 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.460
 and I have it all mixed 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.110
 as you can see that a spongy 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.970
 we will put in the world 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.360
 and we'll put it in the oven for space 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.190
 from 30 to 35 minutes and now when 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.480
 Put it in the oven under the temperature 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:29.270
 at 160 degrees and I just leave the part of 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.230
 down lit so I do not put 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.230
 fan or anything 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.480
 spend 30 minutes and we will look and we can 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.260
 do the skewer test to see if 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.260
 it's already cooked 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.940
 and this removed the biscuit from the oven what 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.220
 I had 30 minutes 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.990
 with the oven below and then I have 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.330
 put 5 minutes that also had 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.910
 heat for 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:02.310
 you can see how it is 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.310
 Father Perez and now he denies it 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.230
 we will do with jam what 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.060
 if you do not want coverage because 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.870
 that each one can decorate both 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.750
 as you can see and to the meeting 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.000
 very careful we will put the layer that 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.300
 we have cut 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.170
 we go well 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.170
 best possible 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.970
 and I'm going to put the coverage of 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.040
 chocolate 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.970
 I have it covered I will put it in the 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:49.590
 refrigerator so that the chocolate 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.590
 the time I do not know when 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.640
 all right 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.980
 I hope you do it 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.329
 a greeting
