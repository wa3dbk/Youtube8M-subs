00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
dry out those peppers I i think the

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.250 
dry out those peppers I i think the
Scoville<00:00:32.940> units<00:00:33.300> like<00:00:33.450> off<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.690> chart<00:00:34.140> on

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
Scoville units like off the chart on

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.569 
Scoville units like off the chart on
these<00:00:34.550> i<00:00:35.550> do<00:00:35.880> think<00:00:36.360> there's<00:00:36.570> actually<00:00:36.960> one

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
these i do think there's actually one

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.490 
these i do think there's actually one
called<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.730> scorpion<00:00:39.390> back<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:39.840> may<00:00:40.230> be<00:00:40.290> a

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
called the scorpion back that may be a

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.560 
called the scorpion back that may be a
little<00:00:40.620> hotter<00:00:40.860> but<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.489> think<00:00:42.180> once<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.450> get

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
little hotter but I think once you get

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.750 
little hotter but I think once you get
to<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.750> point<00:00:43.550> it's<00:00:44.550> really<00:00:44.820> fucking<00:00:45.120> hot<00:00:45.379> so
