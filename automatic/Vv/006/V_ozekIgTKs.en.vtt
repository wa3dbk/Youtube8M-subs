00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
very helpful you know the help with

very helpful you know the help with
chores<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.880> stuff<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:07.170> Germanic

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
chores and stuff so the Germanic

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.530 
chores and stuff so the Germanic
cultures<00:01:08.040> believe<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.939> cobalt<00:01:09.330> was

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
cultures believe that the cobalt was

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.920 
cultures believe that the cobalt was
sort<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.460> an<00:01:11.460> unseen<00:01:12.060> presence<00:01:12.360> in<00:01:12.780> their

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
sort of a an unseen presence in their

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.850 
sort of a an unseen presence in their
homes<00:01:14.420> so<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.450> guess<00:01:15.900> that's<00:01:16.049> why<00:01:16.290> they<00:01:16.590> made<00:01:16.770> it

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
homes so I guess that's why they made it

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.480 
homes so I guess that's why they made it
look<00:01:16.890> like<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.189> rat<00:01:17.490> in<00:01:18.200> in<00:01:19.200> some<00:01:19.830> cases<00:01:20.070> that

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
look like a rat in in some cases that

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.120 
look like a rat in in some cases that
just<00:01:20.729> spends<00:01:21.360> all<00:01:21.509> their<00:01:21.689> lives<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.229> tunnels

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
just spends all their lives and tunnels

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.719 
just spends all their lives and tunnels
and<00:01:23.369> that's<00:01:23.810> the<00:01:24.810> form<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.500> Blizzard<00:01:26.490> went

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
and that's the form that Blizzard went

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.800 
and that's the form that Blizzard went
with<00:01:27.180> as<00:01:27.360> well<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:28.110> depict<00:01:28.470> this<00:01:28.590> creature<00:01:28.890> a

with as well to depict this creature a

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.030

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
lot of lizard creatures are actually

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.450 
lot of lizard creatures are actually
based<00:01:32.220> off<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:33.110> which<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.259> in<00:01:34.380> folklore<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:34.920> a

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
based off of which is in folklore that a

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.649 
based off of which is in folklore that a
lot<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.759> people<00:01:35.850> probably<00:01:36.150> don't<00:01:36.360> know<00:01:36.630> about

lot of people probably don't know about

lot of people probably don't know about
I<00:01:36.960> had<00:01:37.380> no<00:01:37.530> idea<00:01:37.560> personally<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.369> thought<00:01:38.850> it

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
I had no idea personally I thought it

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.899 
I had no idea personally I thought it
was<00:01:39.000> made<00:01:39.210> up<00:01:39.390> but<00:01:39.780> i<00:01:40.140> did<00:01:40.500> my<00:01:40.680> my<00:01:41.159> homework<00:01:41.549> and

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
was made up but i did my my homework and

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.940 
was made up but i did my my homework and
i<00:01:42.299> found<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.229> was<00:01:43.259> based<00:01:43.530> off<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.770> real

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
i found that it was based off a real

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.999 
i found that it was based off a real
thing<00:01:44.220> so<00:01:45.149> that's<00:01:45.329> kind<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.600> interesting<00:01:46.009> but

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
thing so that's kind of interesting but

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.100 
thing so that's kind of interesting but
the<00:01:47.399> reason<00:01:47.700> i<00:01:47.880> chose<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:48.090> cobol<00:01:48.479> also<00:01:48.930> is

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
the reason i chose a cobol also is

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.810 
the reason i chose a cobol also is
because<00:01:49.500> i<00:01:49.619> wanted<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.920> try<00:01:50.130> out<00:01:50.189> my<00:01:50.340> stylist

where<00:01:57.689> i<00:01:57.719> explain<00:01:57.869> what<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.409> stylist<00:01:58.770> does

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
where i explain what the stylist does

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.789 
where i explain what the stylist does
and<00:01:59.219> what<00:01:59.340> it's<00:01:59.460> used<00:01:59.610> for<00:01:59.990> and<00:02:00.990> how<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.469> make

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
and what it's used for and how to make

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.969 
and what it's used for and how to make
one<00:02:02.240> so<00:02:03.240> it's<00:02:03.509> quite<00:02:03.719> easy<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.619> make<00:02:04.799> one

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
one so it's quite easy to to make one

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.670 
one so it's quite easy to to make one
and<00:02:05.280> I<00:02:05.490> at<00:02:05.909> this<00:02:06.119> point<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.719> consider<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.439> an

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
and I at this point I consider it an

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.160 
and I at this point I consider it an
invaluable<00:02:08.009> tool<00:02:08.340> because<00:02:09.119> as<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:10.020> can<00:02:10.050> see

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
invaluable tool because as you can see

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.320 
invaluable tool because as you can see
right<00:02:10.319> there<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.679> beard<00:02:11.069> looks<00:02:11.430> really<00:02:11.760> good

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
right there the beard looks really good

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.230 
right there the beard looks really good
and<00:02:12.800> that<00:02:13.800> beard<00:02:14.250> would<00:02:14.460> be<00:02:14.640> extremely

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
and that beard would be extremely

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.840 
and that beard would be extremely
difficult<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.990> achieve<00:02:16.110> with<00:02:16.470> just<00:02:16.850> pure

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
difficult to achieve with just pure

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.000 
difficult to achieve with just pure
pencil<00:02:18.330> work<00:02:18.510> you<00:02:19.320> might<00:02:19.500> not<00:02:19.620> see<00:02:19.680> all<00:02:19.890> the

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
pencil work you might not see all the

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.980 
pencil work you might not see all the
details<00:02:20.400> but<00:02:20.670> in<00:02:20.820> reality<00:02:21.060> it's<00:02:21.480> even<00:02:21.780> better

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
details but in reality it's even better

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.540 
details but in reality it's even better
it<00:02:22.320> looks<00:02:22.530> even<00:02:22.680> better<00:02:22.860> than<00:02:23.010> on<00:02:23.190> camera

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
it looks even better than on camera

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.510 
it looks even better than on camera
camera<00:02:24.120> obviously<00:02:24.750> so<00:02:25.040> what<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.160> stylist

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
camera obviously so what the stylist

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.030 
camera obviously so what the stylist
does<00:02:26.760> just<00:02:27.300> a<00:02:27.510> quick<00:02:27.900> recap<00:02:28.290> is<00:02:28.590> it<00:02:28.800> makes

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
does just a quick recap is it makes

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.490 
does just a quick recap is it makes
indentations<00:02:29.850> in<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.030> paper<00:02:30.300> so<00:02:31.200> when<00:02:31.380> you

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
indentations in the paper so when you

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.490 
indentations in the paper so when you
run<00:02:31.890> with<00:02:32.040> your<00:02:32.160> pencil<00:02:32.370> over<00:02:32.700> it<00:02:32.820> it'll

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
run with your pencil over it it'll

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.730 
run with your pencil over it it'll
produce<00:02:34.500> a<00:02:34.770> white<00:02:35.010> outline<00:02:35.400> and<00:02:36.590> that's<00:02:37.590> very

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
produce a white outline and that's very

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.740 
produce a white outline and that's very
useful<00:02:37.890> for<00:02:38.100> very<00:02:38.430> fine<00:02:38.700> detail<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.420> hair

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
useful for very fine detail and hair

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.550 
useful for very fine detail and hair
especially<00:02:40.200> here<00:02:40.890> it's<00:02:41.480> awesome<00:02:42.480> really<00:02:43.260> I

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
especially here it's awesome really I

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.320 
especially here it's awesome really I
should<00:02:44.190> have<00:02:44.280> used<00:02:44.430> it<00:02:44.580> before<00:02:44.670> it<00:02:45.060> just

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
should have used it before it just

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.010 
should have used it before it just
didn't<00:02:45.750> cross<00:02:45.930> my<00:02:46.140> mind<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:47.480> from<00:02:48.480> now<00:02:48.540> on<00:02:48.690> I

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
didn't cross my mind and from now on I

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.620 
didn't cross my mind and from now on I
will<00:02:49.080> be<00:02:49.320> using<00:02:49.590> it<00:02:49.860> on<00:02:50.040> a<00:02:50.070> lot<00:02:50.310> of<00:02:50.430> tech<00:02:51.330> stuff

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
will be using it on a lot of tech stuff

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.400 
will be using it on a lot of tech stuff
and<00:02:51.990> even<00:02:52.680> organic<00:02:53.900> for<00:02:54.900> example<00:02:55.260> in<00:02:55.320> this

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
and even organic for example in this

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.230 
and even organic for example in this
drawing<00:02:55.590> i<00:02:55.770> use<00:02:55.920> it<00:02:56.070> to<00:02:56.220> create<00:02:56.430> texture<00:02:56.970> like

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
drawing i use it to create texture like

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.360 
drawing i use it to create texture like
on<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.570> eyebrows<00:02:58.020> you<00:02:58.650> know<00:02:58.709> how<00:02:58.890> old<00:02:58.920> people

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
on the eyebrows you know how old people

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.000 
on the eyebrows you know how old people
have<00:02:59.670> wrinkly<00:03:00.150> eyebrows<00:03:00.600> I<00:03:00.990> figured<00:03:01.470> it<00:03:01.860> would

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
have wrinkly eyebrows I figured it would

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.710 
have wrinkly eyebrows I figured it would
look<00:03:02.130> good<00:03:02.310> on<00:03:02.370> a<00:03:02.550> call<00:03:02.790> well<00:03:02.940> as<00:03:03.060> well<00:03:03.240> and<00:03:03.450> on

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
look good on a call well as well and on

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.020 
look good on a call well as well and on
the<00:03:03.810> nostrils<00:03:04.350> and<00:03:04.709> on<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.580> front<00:03:05.730> of<00:03:05.880> its

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
the nostrils and on the front of its

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.680 
the nostrils and on the front of its
snout<00:03:06.270> so<00:03:07.110> I<00:03:07.140> used<00:03:07.620> it<00:03:07.740> in<00:03:07.830> a<00:03:07.920> lot<00:03:08.100> of<00:03:08.130> places

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
snout so I used it in a lot of places

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.290 
snout so I used it in a lot of places
right<00:03:09.690> now<00:03:09.810> I'm<00:03:09.990> doing<00:03:10.800> the<00:03:11.010> nostrils<00:03:11.459> and<00:03:11.760> in

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
right now I'm doing the nostrils and in

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.090 
right now I'm doing the nostrils and in
this<00:03:12.720> drawing<00:03:12.959> I<00:03:13.170> tried<00:03:13.410> a<00:03:13.440> bit<00:03:13.950> of<00:03:14.040> a

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
this drawing I tried a bit of a

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.250 
this drawing I tried a bit of a
different<00:03:14.430> technique<00:03:14.790> I<00:03:15.180> always<00:03:15.930> have<00:03:16.020> the

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
different technique I always have the

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.560 
different technique I always have the
tendency<00:03:16.470> to<00:03:16.980> press<00:03:17.370> too<00:03:17.640> hard<00:03:17.670> on<00:03:18.000> my<00:03:18.120> pencil

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
tendency to press too hard on my pencil

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.860 
tendency to press too hard on my pencil
and<00:03:19.970> once<00:03:20.970> you<00:03:21.060> start<00:03:21.330> doing<00:03:21.450> that<00:03:21.690> you<00:03:21.840> can't

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
and once you start doing that you can't

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.990 
and once you start doing that you can't
really<00:03:22.200> stop<00:03:22.500> I<00:03:22.709> either<00:03:22.830> have<00:03:23.130> to<00:03:23.280> erase<00:03:23.580> or

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
really stop I either have to erase or

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.550 
really stop I either have to erase or
keep<00:03:24.450> doing<00:03:24.750> it<00:03:24.900> and<00:03:25.080> most<00:03:25.200> of<00:03:25.320> the<00:03:25.380> time<00:03:25.530> I

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
keep doing it and most of the time I

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.530 
keep doing it and most of the time I
just<00:03:25.680> end<00:03:26.100> up<00:03:26.220> doing<00:03:26.430> it<00:03:27.030> on<00:03:27.269> the<00:03:27.420> whole

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
just end up doing it on the whole

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.229 
just end up doing it on the whole
drawing<00:03:27.780> so<00:03:28.110> it<00:03:28.709> just<00:03:28.920> looks<00:03:29.130> too<00:03:29.220> dark<00:03:29.640> I<00:03:29.940> keep

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
drawing so it just looks too dark I keep

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.090 
drawing so it just looks too dark I keep
looking<00:03:30.420> at<00:03:30.690> some<00:03:30.989> of<00:03:31.019> my<00:03:31.140> older<00:03:31.440> drawings<00:03:31.830> and

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
looking at some of my older drawings and

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.430 
looking at some of my older drawings and
it's<00:03:32.940> hard<00:03:33.239> to<00:03:33.450> even<00:03:33.480> get<00:03:33.840> an<00:03:33.959> outline<00:03:34.410> of

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
it's hard to even get an outline of

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.190 
it's hard to even get an outline of
things<00:03:34.860> because<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:36.209> shading<00:03:36.600> is<00:03:36.720> just<00:03:36.930> so

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
things because the shading is just so

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.949 
things because the shading is just so
intense<00:03:37.800> that<00:03:38.070> the<00:03:38.400> outlines<00:03:38.790> were<00:03:39.030> did<00:03:39.420> he

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
intense that the outlines were did he

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.509 
intense that the outlines were did he
gets<00:03:40.170> lost<00:03:40.470> in<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:41.190> drawing<00:03:41.540> but<00:03:42.540> here<00:03:43.230> I<00:03:43.519> I

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
gets lost in the drawing but here I I

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.509 
gets lost in the drawing but here I I
try<00:03:44.970> to<00:03:45.000> be<00:03:45.180> as<00:03:45.510> light<00:03:45.840> as<00:03:45.870> possible<00:03:46.860> with<00:03:47.489> a

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
try to be as light as possible with a

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.310 
try to be as light as possible with a
pencil<00:03:47.760> and<00:03:48.150> I<00:03:48.660> think<00:03:48.870> it<00:03:48.959> worked<00:03:49.140> out<00:03:49.260> really

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
pencil and I think it worked out really

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.830 
pencil and I think it worked out really
well<00:03:49.620> because<00:03:50.040> you<00:03:50.790> on<00:03:51.090> the<00:03:51.300> face<00:03:51.450> you<00:03:51.750> know

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
well because you on the face you know

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.390 
well because you on the face you know
there's<00:03:52.050> a<00:03:52.110> lot<00:03:52.170> of<00:03:52.290> detail<00:03:52.739> you<00:03:52.920> can<00:03:53.010> see<00:03:53.220> that

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
there's a lot of detail you can see that

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.540 
there's a lot of detail you can see that
it's<00:03:53.610> very<00:03:53.760> fine<00:03:54.150> it's<00:03:54.420> very<00:03:54.980> nice<00:03:55.980> it<00:03:56.370> looks

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
it's very fine it's very nice it looks

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.970 
it's very fine it's very nice it looks
very<00:03:56.610> good<00:03:56.940> but<00:03:57.300> you<00:03:57.989> know<00:03:58.080> I<00:03:58.140> didn't<00:03:58.500> go<00:03:58.709> past

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
very good but you know I didn't go past

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.610 
very good but you know I didn't go past
like<00:03:59.370> fifty<00:03:59.760> percent<00:04:00.030> gray<00:04:00.360> I'm<00:04:00.660> most<00:04:01.410> of<00:04:01.560> the

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
like fifty percent gray I'm most of the

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.110 
like fifty percent gray I'm most of the
face<00:04:01.800> except<00:04:02.220> maybe<00:04:02.310> for<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:02.610> year<00:04:02.910> because

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
face except maybe for the year because

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.090 
face except maybe for the year because
it<00:04:03.480> has<00:04:03.660> to<00:04:03.840> have<00:04:03.959> a<00:04:03.989> bit<00:04:04.170> of<00:04:04.200> depth<00:04:04.500> or<00:04:04.830> maybe

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
it has to have a bit of depth or maybe

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.580 
it has to have a bit of depth or maybe
the<00:04:05.220> nostrils<00:04:05.670> as<00:04:05.790> well<00:04:05.820> as<00:04:06.510> for<00:04:07.110> the<00:04:07.200> rest<00:04:07.320> i

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
the nostrils as well as for the rest i

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.670 
the nostrils as well as for the rest i
was<00:04:07.800> just<00:04:08.070> extremely<00:04:08.489> light<00:04:08.820> with<00:04:09.000> it<00:04:09.120> and

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
was just extremely light with it and

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.840 
was just extremely light with it and
thankfully<00:04:10.680> my<00:04:10.799> camera<00:04:11.160> picks<00:04:11.400> it<00:04:11.549> up<00:04:11.640> and

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
thankfully my camera picks it up and

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.210 
thankfully my camera picks it up and
also<00:04:12.390> these<00:04:12.900> pencils<00:04:13.200> are<00:04:13.500> great<00:04:13.739> for<00:04:13.920> that<00:04:13.980> as

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
also these pencils are great for that as

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.420 
also these pencils are great for that as
well<00:04:14.250> because<00:04:14.610> they<00:04:14.880> have<00:04:15.030> a<00:04:15.080> more<00:04:16.080> intense

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
well because they have a more intense

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.349 
well because they have a more intense
coloring<00:04:19.009> so<00:04:20.009> you<00:04:20.519> can<00:04:20.669> see<00:04:20.789> the<00:04:20.910> stitches

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
coloring so you can see the stitches

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.590 
coloring so you can see the stitches
under<00:04:22.049> its<00:04:22.620> arm<00:04:22.830> there<00:04:23.070> I<00:04:23.100> use<00:04:23.490> the<00:04:23.880> stylus<00:04:24.300> for

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
under its arm there I use the stylus for

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.060 
under its arm there I use the stylus for
those<00:04:24.750> as<00:04:24.900> well<00:04:25.020> just<00:04:25.500> make<00:04:25.710> small

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
those as well just make small

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.650 
those as well just make small
indentations<00:04:26.759> in<00:04:26.880> the<00:04:26.940> paper<00:04:27.180> and<00:04:27.360> then<00:04:27.479> just

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
indentations in the paper and then just

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.080 
indentations in the paper and then just
run<00:04:28.199> the<00:04:28.289> pencil<00:04:28.620> over<00:04:28.800> at<00:04:28.889> once<00:04:29.130> and<00:04:29.400> you

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
run the pencil over at once and you

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.450 
run the pencil over at once and you
create<00:04:30.389> a<00:04:30.419> stitch<00:04:30.870> with<00:04:31.199> a<00:04:31.229> highlight<00:04:31.710> and<00:04:32.039> the

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
create a stitch with a highlight and the

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.210 
create a stitch with a highlight and the
sort<00:04:32.699> of<00:04:32.729> a<00:04:32.850> shadow<00:04:33.120> so<00:04:33.919> those<00:04:34.919> would<00:04:35.070> be<00:04:35.190> a

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
sort of a shadow so those would be a

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.510 
sort of a shadow so those would be a
pain<00:04:35.490> to<00:04:35.669> shade<00:04:35.910> with<00:04:36.620> with<00:04:37.620> just<00:04:37.949> the<00:04:38.100> pencil

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
pain to shade with with just the pencil

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.629 
pain to shade with with just the pencil
as<00:04:39.620> for<00:04:40.620> the<00:04:40.710> hands<00:04:41.130> I<00:04:43.400> didn't<00:04:44.400> have<00:04:44.490> any

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
as for the hands I didn't have any

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:47.689 
as for the hands I didn't have any
reference<00:04:45.090> for<00:04:45.270> the<00:04:45.330> poles<00:04:45.570> so<00:04:46.229> the<00:04:46.919> pose<00:04:47.520> I

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:47.699 
reference for the poles so the pose I

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:49.550 
reference for the poles so the pose I
made<00:04:47.850> up<00:04:47.970> myself<00:04:48.150> I<00:04:48.630> had<00:04:48.870> a<00:04:48.900> reference<00:04:49.320> for<00:04:49.440> the

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
made up myself I had a reference for the

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.120 
made up myself I had a reference for the
face<00:04:49.770> but<00:04:50.070> that's<00:04:50.130> reddit<00:04:50.690> but<00:04:51.690> the<00:04:52.470> hands

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
face but that's reddit but the hands

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.310 
face but that's reddit but the hands
look<00:04:53.430> a<00:04:53.550> bit<00:04:53.699> rigid<00:04:54.020> especially<00:04:55.020> the<00:04:55.139> right

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
look a bit rigid especially the right

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.110 
look a bit rigid especially the right
one<00:04:55.560> the<00:04:55.830> fingers<00:04:56.160> look<00:04:56.310> a<00:04:56.430> bit<00:04:56.610> too<00:04:56.789> straight

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
one the fingers look a bit too straight

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.870 
one the fingers look a bit too straight
I<00:04:57.419> noticed<00:04:57.990> that<00:04:58.470> after<00:04:58.680> i<00:04:58.919> had<00:04:59.250> finished

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
I noticed that after i had finished

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.480 
I noticed that after i had finished
because<00:05:00.570> i<00:05:00.780> was<00:05:00.900> like<00:05:01.229> really<00:05:01.650> into<00:05:02.070> it<00:05:02.099> so<00:05:02.460> i

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
because i was like really into it so i

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.060 
because i was like really into it so i
didn't<00:05:02.820> really<00:05:02.940> pay<00:05:03.180> attention<00:05:03.210> to<00:05:03.650> to<00:05:04.650> this

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
didn't really pay attention to to this

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.790 
didn't really pay attention to to this
stuff<00:05:05.630> but<00:05:06.630> i<00:05:06.960> still<00:05:07.259> think<00:05:07.440> it<00:05:07.590> looks

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
stuff but i still think it looks

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.700 
stuff but i still think it looks
acceptable<00:05:08.400> at<00:05:09.300> least<00:05:09.509> the<00:05:09.660> hand<00:05:09.840> it<00:05:10.050> looks<00:05:10.259> ok

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
acceptable at least the hand it looks ok

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.210 
acceptable at least the hand it looks ok
it's<00:05:11.130> not<00:05:11.340> that<00:05:11.400> bad<00:05:12.150> I<00:05:12.539> use<00:05:13.440> the<00:05:13.590> stylus<00:05:13.800> a<00:05:14.070> lot

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
it's not that bad I use the stylus a lot

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.159 
it's not that bad I use the stylus a lot
for<00:05:14.400> the<00:05:14.490> nails<00:05:14.699> to<00:05:15.180> just<00:05:15.630> give<00:05:15.990> it<00:05:16.080> the

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
for the nails to just give it the

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:18.770 
for the nails to just give it the
impression<00:05:16.590> of<00:05:16.729> that<00:05:17.729> they're<00:05:17.910> scratched<00:05:18.389> and

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
impression of that they're scratched and

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.620 
impression of that they're scratched and
dirty<00:05:19.020> and<00:05:19.530> nasty<00:05:20.009> from<00:05:20.849> all<00:05:21.030> the<00:05:21.240> digging

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
dirty and nasty from all the digging

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.909 
dirty and nasty from all the digging
this<00:05:21.870> guy's<00:05:22.110> been<00:05:22.289> doing<00:05:22.620> and<00:05:24.800> another<00:05:25.800> thing

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
this guy's been doing and another thing

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:27.500 
this guy's been doing and another thing
that<00:05:26.310> was<00:05:26.460> sort<00:05:26.789> of<00:05:26.849> challenging<00:05:27.360> on<00:05:27.449> the

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
that was sort of challenging on the

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.290 
that was sort of challenging on the
hands<00:05:27.840> was<00:05:28.550> estimating<00:05:29.550> where<00:05:29.699> the<00:05:29.789> folds

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
hands was estimating where the folds

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.909 
hands was estimating where the folds
would<00:05:30.630> come<00:05:30.930> because<00:05:31.349> you<00:05:31.500> know<00:05:31.620> when<00:05:31.800> you

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 
would come because you know when you

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:33.649 
would come because you know when you
when<00:05:32.639> you<00:05:32.669> wear<00:05:32.909> a<00:05:32.940> glove<00:05:33.120> and<00:05:33.419> you<00:05:33.479> make<00:05:33.630> a

00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:33.659 
when you wear a glove and you make a

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:37.159 
when you wear a glove and you make a
fist<00:05:33.990> around<00:05:34.229> an<00:05:35.099> object<00:05:35.370> or<00:05:35.940> a<00:05:36.630> stick

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
fist around an object or a stick

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:40.070 
fist around an object or a stick
whatever<00:05:37.590> there<00:05:38.220> will<00:05:38.400> be<00:05:38.430> folds<00:05:39.060> let<00:05:39.690> go<00:05:39.870> all

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
whatever there will be folds let go all

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.210 
whatever there will be folds let go all
over<00:05:40.229> the<00:05:40.380> place<00:05:40.699> so<00:05:41.699> those<00:05:42.090> are<00:05:42.270> kind<00:05:42.300> of

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:43.220 
over the place so those are kind of

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.249 
over the place so those are kind of
difficult<00:05:44.220> to<00:05:44.460> to<00:05:44.940> guess<00:05:45.270> where<00:05:45.780> they<00:05:45.960> were

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:46.259 
difficult to to guess where they were

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:50.570 
difficult to to guess where they were
they<00:05:46.289> go<00:05:46.560> but<00:05:47.659> just<00:05:48.659> keep<00:05:49.409> trying<00:05:49.710> and<00:05:50.009> erasing

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
they go but just keep trying and erasing

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.760 
they go but just keep trying and erasing
if<00:05:50.759> it<00:05:50.880> doesn't<00:05:51.120> work<00:05:51.210> out<00:05:51.560> that's<00:05:52.560> for<00:05:52.710> the

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
if it doesn't work out that's for the

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.920 
if it doesn't work out that's for the
patch<00:05:52.979> on<00:05:53.280> the<00:05:53.310> left<00:05:53.729> hand<00:05:53.970> I<00:05:54.180> used<00:05:54.659> the<00:05:54.750> same

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
patch on the left hand I used the same

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.330 
patch on the left hand I used the same
thing<00:05:55.199> I<00:05:55.289> did<00:05:55.349> for<00:05:55.620> this<00:05:55.740> stitches<00:05:56.190> on<00:05:56.310> the

thing I did for this stitches on the

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.860 
thing I did for this stitches on the
right<00:05:56.550> arm<00:05:56.820> like<00:05:57.509> making<00:05:59.180> the<00:06:00.180> lines<00:06:00.389> with<00:06:00.659> the

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
right arm like making the lines with the

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.810 
right arm like making the lines with the
stylus<00:06:01.289> first<00:06:01.710> and<00:06:01.979> then<00:06:02.130> running<00:06:02.310> the<00:06:02.490> pencil

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 
stylus first and then running the pencil

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.490 
stylus first and then running the pencil
over<00:06:03.000> them<00:06:03.120> to<00:06:03.300> give<00:06:03.630> an<00:06:03.720> impression<00:06:04.020> that<00:06:04.229> the

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:44.630 
drawing I give it a bit more animal

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:51.210 
joint going in the back and this would

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.490 
joint going in the back and this would
look<00:06:51.419> like<00:06:51.570> dogs<00:06:51.900> legs<00:06:52.340> so<00:06:54.080> just<00:06:55.080> to<00:06:55.169> give<00:06:55.199> it<00:06:55.350> a

look like dogs legs so just to give it a

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.850 
look like dogs legs so just to give it a
bit<00:06:55.650> of<00:06:55.680> a<00:06:56.160> savagery<00:06:57.150> I<00:06:57.270> would<00:06:57.539> guess<00:06:57.750> I<00:06:57.990> would

00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:58.860 
bit of a savagery I would guess I would

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.180 
bit of a savagery I would guess I would
say<00:06:58.889> so<00:06:59.580> around<00:07:00.510> its<00:07:00.720> foot<00:07:01.050> there's<00:07:01.710> a<00:07:01.800> cloth

00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:13.139 
been doing just doing the handle there

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:15.260 
been doing just doing the handle there
that's<00:07:13.530> covered<00:07:13.830> in<00:07:13.979> some<00:07:14.310> strips<00:07:14.880> of<00:07:15.030> rags

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:15.270 
that's covered in some strips of rags

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:18.760 
that's covered in some strips of rags
and<00:07:15.539> now<00:07:16.500> I'm<00:07:16.650> getting<00:07:16.830> to<00:07:17.100> the<00:07:17.220> pickaxe

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:18.770 
and now I'm getting to the pickaxe

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.800 
and now I'm getting to the pickaxe
making<00:07:19.770> sure<00:07:19.949> that<00:07:20.190> I<00:07:20.520> give<00:07:20.820> it<00:07:20.940> a<00:07:21.030> random<00:07:21.449> wood

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:21.810 
making sure that I give it a random wood

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:24.860 
making sure that I give it a random wood
texture<00:07:22.320> and<00:07:23.120> also<00:07:24.120> making<00:07:24.300> sure<00:07:24.389> that<00:07:24.630> I<00:07:24.690> give

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:24.870 
texture and also making sure that I give

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.589 
texture and also making sure that I give
it<00:07:24.930> a<00:07:24.960> core<00:07:25.169> shadow<00:07:25.440> so<00:07:25.889> it<00:07:26.340> looks<00:07:26.580> right<00:07:26.820> and

00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:27.599 
it a core shadow so it looks right and

00:07:27.599 --> 00:07:29.480 
it a core shadow so it looks right and
that's<00:07:28.080> for<00:07:28.199> the<00:07:28.229> pickaxe<00:07:28.650> I<00:07:28.800> didn't<00:07:29.099> like

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:29.490 
that's for the pickaxe I didn't like

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.060 
that's for the pickaxe I didn't like
detail<00:07:30.030> it<00:07:30.210> a<00:07:30.300> lot<00:07:30.510> I<00:07:30.539> just<00:07:30.919> give<00:07:31.919> the

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:32.070 
detail it a lot I just give the

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:35.330 
detail it a lot I just give the
impression<00:07:32.280> of<00:07:32.550> it<00:07:32.729> so<00:07:33.680> it<00:07:34.680> still<00:07:34.889> looks<00:07:35.039> ok

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:35.340 
impression of it so it still looks ok

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:37.670 
impression of it so it still looks ok
and<00:07:35.729> of<00:07:36.120> course<00:07:36.150> a<00:07:36.750> cobalt<00:07:37.289> wouldn't<00:07:37.590> be<00:07:37.650> a

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:37.680 
and of course a cobalt wouldn't be a

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.830 
and of course a cobalt wouldn't be a
kobold<00:07:38.130> without<00:07:38.400> a<00:07:38.430> backpack<00:07:38.970> since<00:07:39.660> they're

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840 
kobold without a backpack since they're

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.390 
kobold without a backpack since they're
miners<00:07:40.229> the<00:07:40.470> head<00:07:40.620> they<00:07:40.830> need<00:07:40.979> a<00:07:41.010> place<00:07:41.190> to

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:41.400 
miners the head they need a place to

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.850 
miners the head they need a place to
keep<00:07:41.550> their<00:07:41.729> stuff<00:07:42.020> very<00:07:43.020> simple<00:07:43.500> just<00:07:43.620> trying

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:43.860 
keep their stuff very simple just trying

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.469 
keep their stuff very simple just trying
a<00:07:43.979> few<00:07:44.130> folds<00:07:44.520> they're<00:07:44.729> drawing<00:07:45.360> the

00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:45.479 
a few folds they're drawing the
