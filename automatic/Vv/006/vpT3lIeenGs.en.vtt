abilities<00:01:52.679> they<00:01:53.219> work<00:01:53.399> in<00:01:53.549> slightly

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
abilities they work in slightly

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:56.269 
abilities they work in slightly
different<00:01:53.909> ways<00:01:54.299> though<00:01:54.569> how<00:01:55.259> so<00:01:55.469> well<00:01:56.159> it

00:01:56.269 --> 00:01:56.279 
different ways though how so well it

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:58.010 
different ways though how so well it
involves<00:01:56.549> when<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:57.060> check<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.329> see<00:01:57.479> whether

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
involves when you check to see whether

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.480 
involves when you check to see whether
or<00:01:58.139> not<00:01:58.319> you<00:01:58.499> control<00:01:58.950> three<00:01:59.279> or<00:01:59.369> more

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
or not you control three or more

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.989 
or not you control three or more
artifacts<00:02:00.149> why<00:02:00.599> don't<00:02:00.749> I<00:02:00.810> set<00:02:01.020> up<00:02:01.109> an<00:02:01.200> example

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:01.999 
artifacts why don't I set up an example

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:05.239 
artifacts why don't I set up an example
okay<00:02:02.999> here<00:02:03.240> we<00:02:03.359> go<00:02:03.389> I<00:02:03.749> control<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.619> chrome<00:02:04.950> steed

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:05.249 
okay here we go I control a chrome steed

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:07.249 
okay here we go I control a chrome steed
a<00:02:05.489> silver<00:02:05.939> mirror<00:02:06.209> and<00:02:06.389> a<00:02:06.479> flight<00:02:06.719> spell<00:02:07.049> bomb

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
a silver mirror and a flight spell bomb

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.770 
a silver mirror and a flight spell bomb
that's<00:02:07.590> one<00:02:07.919> two<00:02:08.250> three<00:02:08.729> artifacts<00:02:09.239> so<00:02:09.660> the

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
that's one two three artifacts so the

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.930 
that's one two three artifacts so the
chrome<00:02:09.989> steed<00:02:10.229> is<00:02:10.349> 44<00:02:10.800> it<00:02:11.250> doesn't<00:02:11.670> matter<00:02:11.849> if

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
chrome steed is 44 it doesn't matter if

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.490 
chrome steed is 44 it doesn't matter if
they're<00:02:12.090> creatures<00:02:12.360> are<00:02:12.630> not<00:02:12.750> as<00:02:12.989> long<00:02:13.319> as

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
they're creatures are not as long as

they're creatures are not as long as
their<00:02:13.620> artifacts<00:02:14.040> also<00:02:14.819> artifacts<00:02:15.390> with

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
their artifacts also artifacts with

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.090 
their artifacts also artifacts with
metal<00:02:15.840> craft<00:02:16.020> abilities<00:02:16.410> themselves<00:02:16.980> are

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
metal craft abilities themselves are

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.740 
metal craft abilities themselves are
pretty<00:02:17.280> awesome<00:02:17.670> because<00:02:18.030> you<00:02:18.240> only<00:02:18.360> need<00:02:18.540> two

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
pretty awesome because you only need two

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.270 
pretty awesome because you only need two
more<00:02:18.780> artifacts<00:02:19.350> to<00:02:19.530> reap<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.800> rewards

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
more artifacts to reap the rewards

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.559 
more artifacts to reap the rewards
that's<00:02:20.940> right<00:02:21.120> Ryan

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
that's right Ryan

that's right Ryan
so<00:02:21.900> first<00:02:22.200> we'll<00:02:22.439> look<00:02:22.560> at<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.709> triggered

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
so first we'll look at a triggered

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.610 
so first we'll look at a triggered
metalcraft<00:02:23.760> ability<00:02:24.209> to<00:02:24.629> help<00:02:24.780> out<00:02:25.019> I'll<00:02:25.319> cast

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
metalcraft ability to help out I'll cast

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.479 
metalcraft ability to help out I'll cast
looming<00:02:25.950> grid<00:02:26.129> Drake<00:02:28.010> okay<00:02:29.010> so<00:02:29.069> here's<00:02:29.430> the

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
looming grid Drake okay so here's the

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:31.859 
looming grid Drake it says when looming

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:33.830 
looming grid Drake it says when looming

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
grid Drake enters the battlefield if you

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.780 
grid Drake enters the battlefield if you

is called an intervening if clause that

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.890 
is called an intervening if clause that
means<00:02:40.920> two<00:02:41.099> things<00:02:41.129> one<00:02:41.939> the<00:02:42.239> game<00:02:42.540> checks

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
means two things one the game checks

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.539 
means two things one the game checks
whether<00:02:43.170> that's<00:02:43.439> true<00:02:43.709> when<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.129> ability

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
whether that's true when the ability

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.339 
whether that's true when the ability
would<00:02:44.700> trigger<00:02:45.060> if<00:02:45.329> it's<00:02:45.540> not<00:02:45.719> true<00:02:46.019> the

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
would trigger if it's not true the

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.209 
would trigger if it's not true the
ability<00:02:46.739> never<00:02:47.010> triggers<00:02:47.400> it<00:02:47.519> all<00:02:49.219> you

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:50.219 
ability never triggers it all you

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:51.860 
ability never triggers it all you
control<00:02:50.579> three<00:02:50.819> or<00:02:50.909> more<00:02:50.969> artifacts<00:02:51.450> so<00:02:51.749> it

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
control three or more artifacts so it

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.690 
control three or more artifacts so it
will<00:02:52.109> trigger<00:02:52.409> and<00:02:52.709> go<00:02:53.099> on<00:02:53.219> the<00:02:53.310> stack<00:02:53.519> and

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
will trigger and go on the stack and

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.909 
will trigger and go on the stack and
when<00:02:54.209> it<00:02:54.299> does<00:02:54.510> I'll<00:02:54.870> target<00:02:55.349> your<00:02:55.469> score<00:02:55.799> you

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:55.919 
when it does I'll target your score you

00:02:55.919 --> 00:03:00.589 
when it does I'll target your score you
elemental<00:02:58.699> so<00:02:59.699> the<00:02:59.819> second<00:03:00.180> thing<00:03:00.329> it<00:03:00.419> means

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
elemental so the second thing it means

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.539 
elemental so the second thing it means
is<00:03:00.989> that<00:03:01.199> when<00:03:01.379> the<00:03:01.409> ability<00:03:01.829> resolves<00:03:01.980> we

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
is that when the ability resolves we

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.339 
is that when the ability resolves we
check<00:03:02.790> if<00:03:02.939> the<00:03:03.060> condition<00:03:03.449> is<00:03:03.540> true<00:03:03.599> again<00:03:04.109> if

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
check if the condition is true again if

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.619 
check if the condition is true again if
it's<00:03:04.919> not<00:03:05.129> the<00:03:05.519> ability<00:03:05.939> is<00:03:06.060> removed<00:03:06.389> from<00:03:06.449> the

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 
it's not the ability is removed from the

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:08.839 
it's not the ability is removed from the
stack<00:03:06.870> and<00:03:07.049> has<00:03:07.169> no<00:03:07.349> effect<00:03:07.680> so<00:03:08.519> if<00:03:08.639> I<00:03:08.699> can

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
stack and has no effect so if I can

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:10.640 
stack and has no effect so if I can
respond<00:03:09.269> to<00:03:09.389> this<00:03:09.480> by<00:03:09.750> destroying<00:03:10.290> one<00:03:10.469> of

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
respond to this by destroying one of

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.770 
respond to this by destroying one of
your<00:03:10.769> artifacts<00:03:11.459> I<00:03:11.669> may<00:03:12.000> be<00:03:12.060> able<00:03:12.269> to<00:03:12.419> stop<00:03:12.629> it

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
your artifacts I may be able to stop it

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.649 
your artifacts I may be able to stop it
correct<00:03:13.349> so<00:03:14.340> in<00:03:14.639> response<00:03:14.760> to<00:03:15.150> that<00:03:15.269> ability

whether or not you control three or more
artifacts<00:03:36.780> both<00:03:37.139> when<00:03:37.349> they<00:03:37.470> would<00:03:37.620> trigger

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
artifacts both when they would trigger

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.429 
artifacts both when they would trigger
and<00:03:38.189> if<00:03:38.639> they<00:03:39.030> do<00:03:39.090> trigger<00:03:39.509> when<00:03:39.930> they<00:03:40.079> resolve

00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:40.439 
and if they do trigger when they resolve

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:43.069 
and if they do trigger when they resolve
so<00:03:41.280> how<00:03:41.459> does<00:03:41.519> that<00:03:41.669> compare<00:03:41.939> to<00:03:42.150> an<00:03:42.329> activated

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
so how does that compare to an activated

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.610 
so how does that compare to an activated
metalcraft<00:03:43.650> ability<00:03:44.040> let's<00:03:44.430> take<00:03:44.609> a<00:03:44.639> look

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
metalcraft ability let's take a look

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.229 
metalcraft ability let's take a look
here's<00:03:46.620> a<00:03:46.709> similar<00:03:47.069> situation<00:03:47.310> to<00:03:47.849> the<00:03:48.000> last

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
here's a similar situation to the last

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.539 
here's a similar situation to the last
one<00:03:48.509> I've<00:03:49.199> added<00:03:49.409> a<00:03:49.590> module<00:03:49.709> concert<00:03:50.280> arc

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
one I've added a module concert arc

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.670 
one I've added a module concert arc
which<00:03:50.759> can<00:03:50.970> tap<00:03:51.239> to<00:03:51.569> tap<00:03:51.599> target<00:03:52.229> artifact

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
which can tap to tap target artifact

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.129 
which can tap to tap target artifact
creature<00:03:52.979> or<00:03:53.280> land<00:03:53.579> but<00:03:54.269> I<00:03:54.299> can<00:03:54.540> only<00:03:54.689> activate

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
creature or land but I can only activate

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:57.199 
creature or land but I can only activate
it<00:03:55.409> if<00:03:55.500> I<00:03:55.620> control<00:03:56.069> three<00:03:56.430> or<00:03:56.519> more<00:03:56.669> artifacts

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
it if I control three or more artifacts

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.319 
it if I control three or more artifacts
and<00:03:57.509> once<00:03:58.049> again<00:03:58.199> you<00:03:58.650> do<00:03:58.859> i<00:03:59.159> do<00:03:59.459> and<00:03:59.970> that

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
and once again you do i do and that

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:02.240 
and once again you do i do and that
pesky<00:04:00.599> scoria<00:04:01.229> elementals<00:04:01.769> in<00:04:01.889> my<00:04:02.009> way<00:04:02.220> again

pesky scoria elementals in my way again
so<00:04:02.970> this<00:04:03.180> time<00:04:03.389> I'll<00:04:03.689> tap<00:04:03.959> it<00:04:04.199> using<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.620> dull

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:04.919 
so this time I'll tap it using the dull

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:07.580 
so this time I'll tap it using the dull
cancer<00:04:05.280> talks<00:04:05.519> ability<00:04:06.319> so<00:04:07.319> what<00:04:07.500> would

would trigger just to see if they do and

would trigger just to see if they do and
then<00:04:58.540> again<00:04:58.930> when<00:04:59.530> they<00:04:59.650> resolve<00:05:00.270> activate
