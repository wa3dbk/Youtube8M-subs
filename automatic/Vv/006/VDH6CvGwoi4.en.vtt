00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
unique rings and it helps them a lot

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.100 
unique rings and it helps them a lot
because<00:01:58.160> they<00:01:58.670> can<00:01:58.880> track<00:01:59.479> shrinking<00:01:59.990> of

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
because they can track shrinking of

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.780 
because they can track shrinking of
inventories<00:02:00.770> that's<00:02:01.070> how<00:02:01.220> they<00:02:01.399> recover

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
inventories that's how they recover

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.539 
inventories that's how they recover
their<00:02:02.030> investment<00:02:02.600> very<00:02:02.780> fast<00:02:03.220> so<00:02:04.220> it<00:02:04.340> works

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
their investment very fast so it works

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.280 
their investment very fast so it works
really<00:02:04.670> well<00:02:04.909> with<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:05.330> new<00:02:05.479> software<00:02:06.020> that
