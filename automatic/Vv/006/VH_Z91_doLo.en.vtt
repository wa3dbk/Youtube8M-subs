00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.359 
something to keep in mind as well Hugh
is<00:01:52.900> that<00:01:53.020> I<00:01:53.229> believe<00:01:53.290> that<00:01:53.890> the<00:01:53.979> team<00:01:54.220> that

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
is that I believe that the team that

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.280 
is that I believe that the team that
gets<00:01:54.460> the<00:01:54.640> host<00:01:54.850> leg<00:01:55.150> one<00:01:55.420> has<00:01:55.900> a<00:01:55.930> true

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
gets the host leg one has a true

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:57.660 
gets the host leg one has a true
advantage<00:01:56.710> in<00:01:56.799> the<00:01:56.860> series<00:01:57.159> because<00:01:57.369> they<00:01:57.520> get

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
advantage in the series because they get

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.190 
advantage in the series because they get
to<00:01:57.729> set<00:01:58.090> the<00:01:58.270> tone<00:01:58.479> at<00:01:58.659> home<00:01:58.840> in<00:01:58.990> front<00:01:59.049> of

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
to set the tone at home in front of

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.660
