00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
spaceman and astronauts because I'm a

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:16.640 
spaceman and astronauts because I'm a
lot<00:04:15.360> of<00:04:15.450> the<00:04:15.540> programs<00:04:15.690> that<00:04:16.019> deal<00:04:16.290> with<00:04:16.500> us

one half of it but then we need somebody
to<00:04:33.630> come<00:04:33.780> along<00:04:33.810> and<00:04:34.050> give<00:04:34.110> the<00:04:34.289> answers<00:04:34.590> and

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
to come along and give the answers and

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.710 
to come along and give the answers and
that<00:04:34.890> they<00:04:35.039> will<00:04:35.190> not<00:04:35.400> do<00:04:35.610> right<00:04:36.390> now<00:04:36.570> on

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
that they will not do right now on

that they will not do right now on
mainstream<00:04:37.080> media<00:04:37.760> here<00:04:38.760> we<00:04:38.850> have<00:04:39.000> again<00:04:39.120> some
