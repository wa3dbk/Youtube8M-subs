tunnel<00:04:17.049> three<00:04:17.350> and<00:04:17.530> four<00:04:17.799> are<00:04:18.100> pretty<00:04:18.910> much

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
tunnel three and four are pretty much

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.930 
tunnel three and four are pretty much
linked<00:04:19.419> so<00:04:19.570> I'm<00:04:19.660> gonna<00:04:19.810> go<00:04:19.959> in<00:04:20.230> tunnel<00:04:20.620> four

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
linked so I'm gonna go in tunnel four

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.860 
linked so I'm gonna go in tunnel four
you'll<00:04:21.940> see<00:04:22.150> what<00:04:22.270> I<00:04:22.300> mean<00:04:24.630> so<00:04:25.630> we're<00:04:25.780> gonna

you'll see what I mean so we're gonna

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.390 
you'll see what I mean so we're gonna
want<00:04:26.110> to<00:04:26.169> destroy<00:04:26.590> the<00:04:26.770> hyenas<00:04:27.250> destroy<00:04:28.030> kill

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
want to destroy the hyenas destroy kill

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.680 
want to destroy the hyenas destroy kill
or<00:04:30.400> really<00:04:30.700> make<00:04:30.850> them<00:04:30.970> faint<00:04:31.270> they<00:04:31.480> really

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
or really make them faint they really

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.940 
or really make them faint they really
don't<00:04:31.900> die<00:04:32.370> and<00:04:34.050> we<00:04:35.050> will<00:04:35.230> get<00:04:35.410> an<00:04:35.500> extra<00:04:35.800> life

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
don't die and we will get an extra life

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.460 
don't die and we will get an extra life
bringing<00:04:36.490> us<00:04:36.610> up<00:04:36.970> to<00:04:37.300> a<00:04:37.330> total<00:04:37.660> of<00:04:37.840> eight<00:04:38.080> lives

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
bringing us up to a total of eight lives

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.120 
bringing us up to a total of eight lives
a<00:04:38.890> more<00:04:39.460> health<00:04:39.760> and<00:04:40.200> an<00:04:41.200> all-around<00:04:41.560> fun<00:04:41.830> time

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
a more health and an all-around fun time

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.710 
a more health and an all-around fun time
now<00:04:42.340> I<00:04:42.370> believe<00:04:42.729> in<00:04:42.910> the<00:04:42.970> harder<00:04:43.180> difficulties

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
now I believe in the harder difficulties

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.860 
now I believe in the harder difficulties
they<00:04:43.870> are<00:04:44.020> not<00:04:44.260> so<00:04:44.590> generous<00:04:45.040> on<00:04:45.220> the<00:04:45.310> lives

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
they are not so generous on the lives

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.180 
they are not so generous on the lives
now<00:04:46.870> notice<00:04:47.229> how<00:04:47.410> I<00:04:47.440> said<00:04:47.770> we<00:04:47.800> would<00:04:48.070> go

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
now notice how I said we would go

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:49.409 
now notice how I said we would go
through<00:04:48.220> tunnel<00:04:48.700> three<00:04:48.910> if<00:04:49.000> we<00:04:49.090> went<00:04:49.240> through

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
through tunnel three if we went through

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:51.510 
through tunnel three if we went through
tunnel<00:04:49.720> four<00:04:49.930> so<00:04:50.200> let's<00:04:50.440> see<00:04:50.830> if<00:04:50.890> I'm<00:04:51.040> accurate

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
tunnel four so let's see if I'm accurate

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.210 
tunnel four so let's see if I'm accurate
but<00:04:52.000> actually<00:04:52.360> takes<00:04:52.630> us<00:04:52.780> over<00:04:53.020> here<00:04:53.560> to<00:04:53.770> a

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
but actually takes us over here to a

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.000 
but actually takes us over here to a
different<00:04:55.030> stage<00:04:55.330> well<00:04:56.200> this<00:04:56.470> is<00:04:56.650> part<00:04:56.950> of

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
different stage well this is part of

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:02.370 
different stage well this is part of
tunnel<00:04:57.370> three<00:04:57.610> it's<00:04:57.790> a<00:04:57.910> sub<00:04:58.180> part<00:05:00.510> so<00:05:01.510> yes<00:05:02.169> we

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
tunnel three it's a sub part so yes we

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.310 
tunnel three it's a sub part so yes we
are<00:05:02.530> going<00:05:02.830> through<00:05:02.979> tunnel<00:05:03.370> three<00:05:03.580> again<00:05:04.320> if

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
are going through tunnel three again if

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.050 
are going through tunnel three again if
you<00:05:05.740> go<00:05:05.890> through<00:05:06.100> tunnel<00:05:06.430> three<00:05:06.580> first<00:05:06.820> you'll

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
you go through tunnel three first you'll

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.300 
you go through tunnel three first you'll
notice<00:05:07.180> that<00:05:07.510> and<00:05:08.050> there<00:05:08.620> we<00:05:08.770> are<00:05:08.800> out<00:05:09.130> of

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
notice that and there we are out of

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.070 
notice that and there we are out of
tunnel<00:05:09.700> three<00:05:12.300> okay<00:05:13.330> want<00:05:13.900> to<00:05:13.960> be<00:05:14.050> careful

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
tunnel three okay want to be careful

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.269 
tunnel three okay want to be careful
