00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.020 

intergenerational<00:00:01.460> aspect<00:00:02.460> of<00:00:02.610> it<00:00:02.760> was<00:00:03.000> a

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
intergenerational aspect of it was a

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.360 
intergenerational aspect of it was a
major<00:00:03.629> selling<00:00:04.049> point<00:00:04.080> I<00:00:04.560> think<00:00:04.859> it<00:00:05.339> takes

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
major selling point I think it takes

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.730 
major selling point I think it takes
community<00:00:06.060> to<00:00:06.390> build<00:00:06.810> a<00:00:07.200> child<00:00:08.069> into<00:00:08.820> a

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:09.740 
community to build a child into a

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:17.300 
community to build a child into a
citizen<00:00:10.740> actually<00:00:11.130> or<00:00:11.400> an<00:00:11.460> adult<00:00:16.310> the

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
citizen actually or an adult the

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.490 
citizen actually or an adult the

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
intergenerational school is doing what

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.370

society we tend to separate ourselves

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.480 
society we tend to separate ourselves
but<00:00:26.460> what<00:00:26.730> our<00:00:26.970> school<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.359> doing<00:00:27.840> is

mistake<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.660> for<00:01:01.050> tutoring<00:01:01.820> people<00:01:02.820> who<00:01:02.940> don't

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
mistake it for tutoring people who don't

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.440 
mistake it for tutoring people who don't
know<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.539> program<00:01:04.309> and<00:01:05.309> they<00:01:05.549> say<00:01:05.790> okay<00:01:06.030> well

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
not just a matter of doing math with the

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.730 
not just a matter of doing math with the
kids<00:01:17.250> it's<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.759> matter<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.140> seeing<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.380> same

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
and doing some math problems and working

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.219 
and doing some math problems and working
fine<00:01:26.159> how<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.610> think<00:01:27.150> about<00:01:27.420> problems<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:27.990> how

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
fine how to think about problems and how

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.070 
fine how to think about problems and how
to<00:01:28.259> solve<00:01:28.680> problems<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.549> it's<00:01:30.360> been<00:01:30.689> good

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
to solve problems and it's been good

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.380 
to solve problems and it's been good
experience<00:01:31.740> for<00:01:31.890> me<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.580> a<00:01:32.729> good<00:01:32.939> experience

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
experience for me and a good experience

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.139 
experience for me and a good experience
for<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:34.590> school<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.490> children<00:01:35.970> I

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
for it is school and the children I

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:38.149 
for it is school and the children I
think<00:01:36.570> that's<00:01:36.810> where<00:01:37.080> we<00:01:37.409> come<00:01:37.649> in<00:01:37.710> as

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
think that's where we come in as

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.389 
think that's where we come in as
measures<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:39.509> come<00:01:40.259> down<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.770> sort<00:01:41.070> of<00:01:41.190> their

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
measures to come down to sort of their

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:44.840 
measures to come down to sort of their
level<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:42.000> their<00:01:42.810> thinking<00:01:43.560> process<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:44.520> help

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
level of their thinking process and help

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.490 
level of their thinking process and help
them<00:01:45.180> achieve<00:01:45.330> greater<00:01:46.110> success<00:01:46.970> both<00:01:47.970> in

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
them achieve greater success both in

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.080 
them achieve greater success both in
life<00:01:49.500> or<00:01:49.890> sport<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:51.710> just<00:01:52.710> got<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.580> general

life there is a connection between the

a zero-tolerance not only for hitting

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.559 
a zero-tolerance not only for hitting

but for just Restless in general to work

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.330 
but for just Restless in general to work
together<00:02:09.899> combined<00:02:10.679> with<00:02:10.860> having<00:02:11.190> older

creates<00:02:13.660> a<00:02:13.960> pattern<00:02:14.800> of<00:02:14.920> respect<00:02:15.490> and<00:02:15.760> absence

creates a pattern of respect and absence

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.170 
creates a pattern of respect and absence
of<00:02:16.810> disruptive<00:02:17.710> behaviors<00:02:18.220> that<00:02:18.550> make<00:02:19.060> it

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
of disruptive behaviors that make it

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.300 
of disruptive behaviors that make it
easier<00:02:19.480> for<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:19.750> kids<00:02:19.780> to<00:02:20.260> study<00:02:20.830> the<00:02:21.040> kinds

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
easier for the kids to study the kinds
