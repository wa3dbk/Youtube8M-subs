so<00:00:02.669> I've<00:00:02.760> been<00:00:02.850> getting<00:00:03.120> a<00:00:03.149> lot<00:00:03.270> of<00:00:03.330> interest

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
so I've been getting a lot of interest

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.630 
so I've been getting a lot of interest
on<00:00:03.990> these<00:00:04.140> hold<00:00:04.380> down<00:00:04.560> toggle<00:00:05.040> clamps<00:00:05.250> that<00:00:05.520> I

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
on these hold down toggle clamps that I

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.789 
on these hold down toggle clamps that I
made<00:00:05.879> and<00:00:06.120> posted<00:00:06.480> a<00:00:06.569> video<00:00:06.690> on<00:00:07.049> and<00:00:07.350> I<00:00:07.470> wanted

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
made and posted a video on and I wanted

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.060 
made and posted a video on and I wanted
to<00:00:07.859> show<00:00:08.130> everybody<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:09.120> couple<00:00:09.450> of<00:00:09.690> updates

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:10.070 
to show everybody a couple of updates

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.549 
to show everybody a couple of updates
things<00:00:11.070> I've<00:00:11.250> changed<00:00:11.790> and<00:00:12.049> also<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.110> walk

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
things I've changed and also to walk

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.829 
things I've changed and also to walk
through<00:00:13.830> it<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:14.040> little<00:00:14.160> bit<00:00:14.309> more<00:00:14.580> that<00:00:14.820> way<00:00:15.000> it

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
through it a little bit more that way it

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.660 
through it a little bit more that way it
kind<00:00:16.049> of<00:00:16.170> explains<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.800> process<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.310> little

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
kind of explains the process a little

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.890 
kind of explains the process a little
better<00:00:17.820> I<00:00:18.119> changed<00:00:18.869> my<00:00:18.990> drawing<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.529> little<00:00:19.710> bit

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
better I changed my drawing a little bit

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.630 
better I changed my drawing a little bit
on<00:00:21.900> my<00:00:22.199> original<00:00:22.439> one<00:00:22.830> this<00:00:22.949> is<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.189> original

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
on my original one this is the original

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.390 
on my original one this is the original
one<00:00:23.850> if<00:00:24.480> you<00:00:24.600> can<00:00:24.750> see<00:00:24.960> this<00:00:25.170> I<00:00:25.439> had<00:00:25.980> problems

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
one if you can see this I had problems

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.130 
one if you can see this I had problems
with<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.699> neck<00:00:26.880> cracking<00:00:27.210> right<00:00:27.599> here<00:00:27.840> so<00:00:28.050> I

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
with the neck cracking right here so I

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.980 
with the neck cracking right here so I
added<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.789> little<00:00:29.789> bit<00:00:30.000> here<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.420> strengthen

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
added a little bit here to strengthen

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.959 
added a little bit here to strengthen
the<00:00:31.380> hold<00:00:31.890> down<00:00:32.040> pressure<00:00:32.399> once<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:32.790> got<00:00:32.910> to

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
the hold down pressure once it got to

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.760 
the hold down pressure once it got to
about<00:00:33.090> eighty<00:00:33.420> pounds<00:00:33.960> that<00:00:34.079> just<00:00:34.320> cracked

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
about eighty pounds that just cracked

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.139 
about eighty pounds that just cracked
right<00:00:35.040> in<00:00:35.130> half<00:00:35.340> with<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:35.700> half-inch

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
right in half with that half-inch

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.470 
right in half with that half-inch
plywood<00:00:36.950> so<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:38.010> added<00:00:38.250> this<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.879> then<00:00:39.300> online

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
plywood so I added this and then online

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.860 
plywood so I added this and then online
on<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.170> new<00:00:40.320> ones<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:40.829> built<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:42.260> added<00:00:43.260> the

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
on the new ones that I built I added the

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.500 
on the new ones that I built I added the
this<00:00:45.870> this<00:00:46.559> side<00:00:47.399> mount<00:00:47.670> here<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.000> made<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.480> go

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
this this side mount here I made it go

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.060 
this this side mount here I made it go
right<00:00:48.809> up<00:00:48.930> into<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.350> neck<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.860> really

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
right up into the neck so it really

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.310 
right up into the neck so it really
strengthened<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:51.510> can<00:00:51.660> see<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.930> difference

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
strengthened you can see the difference

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.189 
strengthened you can see the difference
here<00:00:52.379> from<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:53.360> to<00:00:54.360> this<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:54.989> really

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
here from that to this so it really

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.660 
here from that to this so it really
strengthened<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.010> amount<00:00:56.219> of<00:00:56.309> pressure<00:00:56.550> I

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
strengthened the amount of pressure I

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.750 
strengthened the amount of pressure I
can<00:00:56.820> put<00:00:57.120> down<00:00:57.329> on<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.920> I<00:00:58.920> have<00:00:59.219> some<00:00:59.399> questions

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
can put down on it I have some questions

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.700 
can put down on it I have some questions
about<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.180> set<00:01:00.390> screw<00:01:00.690> here<00:01:00.899> in<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.140> back<00:01:01.350> and

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
about the set screw here in the back and

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.140 
about the set screw here in the back and
up<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:02.309> just<00:01:02.789> that's<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:04.460> seven<00:01:05.460> millimeter<00:01:05.640> bolt

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
up I just that's a seven millimeter bolt

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.030 
up I just that's a seven millimeter bolt
and<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.510> just<00:01:06.689> drill<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.869> five<00:01:07.380> millimeter<00:01:07.650> at<00:01:08.010> a

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
and I just drill a five millimeter at a

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.510 
and I just drill a five millimeter at a
hole<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.580> what<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.390> does<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:10.560> right<00:01:10.619> here

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
hole and what that does it right here

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.520 
hole and what that does it right here
you<00:01:11.939> could<00:01:12.119> come<00:01:12.299> through<00:01:12.330> at<00:01:12.720> an<00:01:12.840> angle<00:01:13.290> when

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
you could come through at an angle when

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.960 
you could come through at an angle when
that's<00:01:13.680> closed<00:01:14.010> that's<00:01:14.310> at<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.460> bit<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.729> an

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
that's closed that's at a bit of an

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.810 
that's closed that's at a bit of an
angle<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:15.600> acts<00:01:16.530> as<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.740> stop<00:01:17.100> so<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.520> can

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
angle and that acts as a stop so I can

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.730 
angle and that acts as a stop so I can
change<00:01:18.030> my<00:01:18.150> position<00:01:18.840> here<00:01:19.080> when<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.290> tighten

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
change my position here when I tighten

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.440 
change my position here when I tighten
it<00:01:19.830> down<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:20.220> moves<00:01:20.430> this<00:01:20.610> up<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.939> little<00:01:21.090> bit<00:01:21.299> or

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
it down it moves this up a little bit or

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.780 
it down it moves this up a little bit or
when<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.320> back<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.770> out<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.009> relieves<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.549> and

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
when I back it out it relieves that and

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.580 
when I back it out it relieves that and
that's<00:01:24.659> just<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.380> stopped<00:01:25.830> position<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:27.060> can

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
that's just a stopped position so I can

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.460 
that's just a stopped position so I can
adjust<00:01:28.590> where<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.250> stops<00:01:29.670> like<00:01:30.540> for<00:01:31.200> instance

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
adjust where it stops like for instance

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.289 
adjust where it stops like for instance
if<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.680> had<00:01:31.799> adjusted<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.400> here<00:01:32.759> where<00:01:33.090> these

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
if I had adjusted it here where these

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.569 
if I had adjusted it here where these
screws<00:01:33.659> are<00:01:33.689> where<00:01:34.470> these<00:01:34.590> bolts<00:01:34.950> are<00:01:35.070> it

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
screws are where these bolts are it

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.910 
screws are where these bolts are it
wouldn't<00:01:36.240> hold<00:01:36.600> down<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.200> would<00:01:37.320> release<00:01:37.650> I

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
wouldn't hold down it would release I

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.999 
wouldn't hold down it would release I
need<00:01:38.189> that<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.970> be<00:01:39.119> just<00:01:39.150> past<00:01:40.110> Center<00:01:40.799> from

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
need that to be just past Center from

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.590 
need that to be just past Center from
this<00:01:41.189> point<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.549> this<00:01:41.670> point<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:42.180> want<00:01:42.390> this

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
this point to this point you want this

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.260 
this point to this point you want this
bolt<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.710> be<00:01:43.799> just<00:01:44.100> past<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.520> center<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:45.060> these

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
bolt to be just past the center of these

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.090 
bolt to be just past the center of these
two<00:01:45.570> just<00:01:45.810> this<00:01:46.020> way<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.259> little<00:01:46.530> bit<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.920> them

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
two just this way a little bit of them

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.520 
two just this way a little bit of them
and<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:48.030> creates<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.659> hold<00:01:48.960> down<00:01:49.200> pressure

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
and that creates that hold down pressure

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.350 
and that creates that hold down pressure
that's<00:01:49.829> what<00:01:50.040> holds<00:01:50.250> it<00:01:50.430> in<00:01:50.549> position<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:51.329> I

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
that's what holds it in position so I

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.289 
that's what holds it in position so I
can<00:01:51.630> adjust<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.170> here<00:01:52.939> instead<00:01:53.939> of<00:01:54.030> hat

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
can adjust that here instead of hat

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.359 
can adjust that here instead of hat
trying<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.750> make<00:01:54.930> these<00:01:55.110> exactly<00:01:55.829> perfect

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
trying to make these exactly perfect

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.980 
trying to make these exactly perfect
it's<00:01:56.640> just<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.969> lot<00:01:57.149> easier<00:01:57.180> way<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.659> make

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
it's just a lot easier way to make

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.800 
it's just a lot easier way to make
adjustments<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.860> also<00:01:59.250> once<00:02:00.210> I've<00:02:00.420> got<00:02:00.600> it

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
adjustments and it also once I've got it

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.480 
adjustments and it also once I've got it
adjusted<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.649> have<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.890> clamping

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
adjusted and I have the clamping

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.370 
adjusted and I have the clamping
pressure<00:02:02.520> down<00:02:03.060> on<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.299> piece<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:03.899> can<00:02:04.079> fine-tune

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
pressure down on a piece I can fine-tune

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.709 
pressure down on a piece I can fine-tune
in<00:02:04.829> here<00:02:05.040> which<00:02:05.189> creates<00:02:05.610> another<00:02:05.820> 15<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.420> 20

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
in here which creates another 15 to 20

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.809 
in here which creates another 15 to 20
pounds<00:02:06.869> of<00:02:07.110> pressure<00:02:07.399> so<00:02:08.399> that's<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.670> nice

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
pounds of pressure so that's a nice

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.699 
pounds of pressure so that's a nice
feature<00:02:08.849> just<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.509> have<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:10.259> saves<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.590> a

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
feature just to have and it saves you a

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.010 
feature just to have and it saves you a
lot<00:02:10.860> of<00:02:10.890> headaches<00:02:11.340> when<00:02:12.150> you're<00:02:12.360> designing

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
lot of headaches when you're designing

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.500 
lot of headaches when you're designing
these<00:02:13.110> little<00:02:13.550> sway<00:02:14.550> arms<00:02:14.940> here<00:02:15.150> in<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.330> back

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
these little sway arms here in the back

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.600 
these little sway arms here in the back
and<00:02:16.440> that's<00:02:16.710> what<00:02:16.890> that<00:02:17.040> that's<00:02:17.370> what<00:02:17.580> that

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
and that's what that that's what that

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.540 
and that's what that that's what that
hold<00:02:18.030> down<00:02:18.120> screw<00:02:18.600> does<00:02:18.810> or<00:02:19.020> that<00:02:19.430> set<00:02:20.430> screw

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
hold down screw does or that set screw

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.890 
hold down screw does or that set screw
does<00:02:20.790> it's<00:02:21.000> just<00:02:21.150> screwed<00:02:21.390> right<00:02:21.570> into<00:02:21.810> the

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
does it's just screwed right into the

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.930 
does it's just screwed right into the
wood<00:02:22.110> so<00:02:22.250> again<00:02:23.250> I<00:02:23.280> use<00:02:23.520> a<00:02:23.550> southern

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
wood so again I use a southern

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.970 
wood so again I use a southern
millimeter<00:02:24.360> bolt<00:02:24.660> with<00:02:25.410> a<00:02:25.440> five<00:02:25.710> millimeter

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
millimeter bolt with a five millimeter

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.040 
millimeter bolt with a five millimeter
hole<00:02:26.520> and<00:02:26.760> then<00:02:26.880> I<00:02:26.910> just<00:02:27.210> turned<00:02:27.720> that<00:02:27.900> it

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
hole and then I just turned that it

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.480 
hole and then I just turned that it
right<00:02:28.200> into<00:02:28.380> it<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:28.710> that<00:02:29.010> seems<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.400> be

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
right into it and that seems to be

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:35.030 
right into it and that seems to be
plenty<00:02:29.790> plenty<00:02:30.510> strong<00:02:32.780> on<00:02:33.780> these<00:02:34.530> right<00:02:34.770> here

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
plenty plenty strong on these right here

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.070 
plenty plenty strong on these right here
up<00:02:35.670> underneath<00:02:36.060> here<00:02:36.360> you<00:02:36.390> can<00:02:36.690> see<00:02:36.870> I've<00:02:37.050> used

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
up underneath here you can see I've used

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.980 
up underneath here you can see I've used
a<00:02:37.470> t<00:02:37.710> know<00:02:37.770> a<00:02:38.070> t-bolt<00:02:38.640> or<00:02:38.940> excuse<00:02:39.360> me<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.570> T<00:02:39.780> nut

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
a t know a t-bolt or excuse me a T nut

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.170 
a t know a t-bolt or excuse me a T nut
and<00:02:40.290> I've<00:02:41.010> set<00:02:41.250> them<00:02:41.430> in<00:02:41.580> just<00:02:41.730> a<00:02:41.910> little<00:02:41.940> bit

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
and I've set them in just a little bit

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.170 
and I've set them in just a little bit
so<00:02:42.540> I<00:02:43.410> can<00:02:43.920> screw<00:02:44.160> my<00:02:44.370> quarter<00:02:44.700> inch<00:02:44.730> threaded

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
so I can screw my quarter inch threaded

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.240 
so I can screw my quarter inch threaded
rod<00:02:45.450> into<00:02:45.690> it<00:02:45.990> and<00:02:46.140> this<00:02:46.650> is<00:02:46.830> just<00:02:46.860> a<00:02:47.070> quarter

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
rod into it and this is just a quarter

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.490 
rod into it and this is just a quarter
inch<00:02:47.490> coarse<00:02:47.820> rod<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:48.360> I've<00:02:48.930> got<00:02:49.110> some<00:02:49.290> rubber

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
inch coarse rod and I've got some rubber

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.680 
inch coarse rod and I've got some rubber
bat<00:02:49.800> pads<00:02:50.220> on<00:02:50.520> order<00:02:50.910> they're<00:02:51.060> not<00:02:51.210> here<00:02:51.510> yet

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
bat pads on order they're not here yet

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.390 
bat pads on order they're not here yet
so<00:02:51.720> I've<00:02:51.930> just<00:02:52.110> been<00:02:52.230> using<00:02:52.440> these<00:02:52.650> wood<00:02:52.950> wood

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
so I've just been using these wood wood

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.860 
so I've just been using these wood wood
ones<00:02:53.640> which<00:02:53.880> seem<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.210> be<00:02:54.300> working<00:02:54.450> okay<00:02:54.840> I

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
ones which seem to be working okay I

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.840 
ones which seem to be working okay I
think<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:55.260> rubber<00:02:55.470> ones<00:02:55.710> will<00:02:55.890> be<00:02:55.980> better<00:02:56.160> it

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
think the rubber ones will be better it

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.690 
think the rubber ones will be better it
give<00:02:57.030> me<00:02:57.180> a<00:02:57.210> little<00:02:57.390> more<00:02:57.660> power<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:58.440> give<00:02:58.740> so

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
give me a little more power and give so

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.660 
give me a little more power and give so
again<00:03:00.350> I've<00:03:01.350> added<00:03:01.620> this<00:03:01.920> to<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.250> neck<00:03:02.430> which

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
again I've added this to the neck which

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.400 
again I've added this to the neck which
makes<00:03:02.910> a<00:03:03.030> lot<00:03:03.210> of<00:03:03.450> difference<00:03:03.960> in<00:03:04.140> the<00:03:04.230> hold

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
makes a lot of difference in the hold

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.710 
makes a lot of difference in the hold
down<00:03:04.560> pressure<00:03:04.860> you<00:03:05.100> can<00:03:05.250> achieve<00:03:05.480> the<00:03:06.480> set

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
down pressure you can achieve the set

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.170 
down pressure you can achieve the set
screw<00:03:06.930> in<00:03:07.020> the<00:03:07.110> back<00:03:07.490> again<00:03:08.490> I<00:03:08.520> just<00:03:08.670> have<00:03:08.880> it

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
screw in the back again I just have it

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.900 
screw in the back again I just have it
drilled<00:03:09.450> right<00:03:09.660> through<00:03:09.960> the<00:03:10.080> wood<00:03:10.230> and

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
drilled right through the wood and

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.190 
drilled right through the wood and
screwed<00:03:11.910> into<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.300> wood<00:03:12.600> I<00:03:12.630> drill<00:03:12.960> a<00:03:12.990> bit

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
screwed into the wood I drill a bit

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.110 
screwed into the wood I drill a bit
smaller<00:03:13.470> hole<00:03:13.740> so<00:03:14.040> it<00:03:14.160> all<00:03:14.280> fits<00:03:14.550> together<00:03:14.700> and

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
smaller hole so it all fits together and

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.120 
smaller hole so it all fits together and
these<00:03:15.780> things<00:03:15.960> have<00:03:16.140> been<00:03:16.230> working<00:03:16.410> great<00:03:16.890> I

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
these things have been working great I

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.040 
these things have been working great I
did<00:03:17.520> put<00:03:17.730> them<00:03:17.820> on<00:03:17.940> a<00:03:17.970> scale<00:03:18.330> to<00:03:18.390> see<00:03:18.750> what<00:03:18.900> kind

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
did put them on a scale to see what kind

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.480 
did put them on a scale to see what kind
of<00:03:19.110> hold<00:03:19.350> down<00:03:19.500> pressure<00:03:19.770> I<00:03:19.890> was<00:03:20.070> getting<00:03:20.370> with

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
of hold down pressure I was getting with

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.670 
of hold down pressure I was getting with
this<00:03:20.670> particular<00:03:21.000> style<00:03:21.540> and<00:03:21.930> I've<00:03:22.530> been

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
this particular style and I've been

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.650 
this particular style and I've been
getting<00:03:22.950> between<00:03:23.840> 120<00:03:24.840> and<00:03:25.050> 140<00:03:25.950> pounds<00:03:26.330> I<00:03:27.330> had

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
getting between 120 and 140 pounds I had

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.600 
getting between 120 and 140 pounds I had
one<00:03:27.900> more<00:03:28.110> made<00:03:28.350> but<00:03:28.560> I<00:03:28.590> tiled<00:03:28.980> it<00:03:29.160> up<00:03:29.280> to<00:03:29.430> about

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
one more made but I tiled it up to about

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:35.030 
one more made but I tiled it up to about
160<00:03:30.510> pounds<00:03:30.690> and<00:03:30.990> it<00:03:31.709> broke<00:03:31.920> so<00:03:33.650> 140<00:03:34.650> pounds<00:03:34.950> is

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
160 pounds and it broke so 140 pounds is

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.310 
160 pounds and it broke so 140 pounds is
probably<00:03:35.490> the<00:03:35.640> the<00:03:36.180> probably<00:03:36.750> max<00:03:36.990> pressure

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
probably the the probably max pressure

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.600 
probably the the probably max pressure
you're<00:03:37.530> going<00:03:37.560> to<00:03:37.740> get<00:03:37.890> out<00:03:38.040> of<00:03:38.190> these<00:03:38.310> the

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
you're going to get out of these the

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.070 
you're going to get out of these the
ones<00:03:38.790> with<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.090> quarter<00:03:39.450> inch<00:03:39.630> that<00:03:39.840> I<00:03:39.900> had

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
ones with the quarter inch that I had

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.180 
ones with the quarter inch that I had
before<00:03:40.440> I<00:03:40.470> had<00:03:40.740> those<00:03:40.950> tested<00:03:41.400> at<00:03:42.350> 150<00:03:43.350> 170<00:03:44.010> and

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
before I had those tested at 150 170 and

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.640 
before I had those tested at 150 170 and
then<00:03:44.880> the<00:03:45.030> bigger<00:03:45.240> ones<00:03:45.570> I<00:03:45.810> had<00:03:45.990> tested<00:03:46.470> at

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
then the bigger ones I had tested at

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.800 
then the bigger ones I had tested at
over<00:03:47.490> two<00:03:47.670> hundred<00:03:47.700> and<00:03:48.030> eighty<00:03:48.300> pounds<00:03:48.540> of

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
over two hundred and eighty pounds of

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.270 
over two hundred and eighty pounds of
pressure<00:03:49.020> so<00:03:49.350> you<00:03:49.440> can<00:03:49.650> achieve<00:03:49.920> some<00:03:50.100> good

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
pressure so you can achieve some good

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.610 
pressure so you can achieve some good
hold<00:03:50.490> down<00:03:50.670> pressure<00:03:51.000> with<00:03:51.240> these<00:03:51.450> I<00:03:51.750> believe

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
hold down pressure with these I believe

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.350 
hold down pressure with these I believe
the<00:03:52.770> commercial<00:03:53.250> ones<00:03:53.490> they<00:03:53.730> say<00:03:53.940> anywhere

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
the commercial ones they say anywhere

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.949 
the commercial ones they say anywhere
from<00:03:55.520> 25<00:03:56.520> pounds<00:03:57.060> of<00:03:57.180> hold<00:03:57.360> down<00:03:57.540> pressure<00:03:57.810> on
