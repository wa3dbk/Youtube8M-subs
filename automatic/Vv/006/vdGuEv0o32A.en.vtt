00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
to them just going to do this with this

one too so two and two alright so you

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.540 
one too so two and two alright so you
can<00:05:13.410> see<00:05:13.560> it's<00:05:13.890> starting<00:05:14.040> to<00:05:14.250> look<00:05:14.310> like<00:05:14.400> a

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
can see it's starting to look like a

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.820 
can see it's starting to look like a
terrain<00:05:14.880> but<00:05:15.419> we<00:05:15.570> we<00:05:16.169> don't<00:05:16.380> have<00:05:16.500> the<00:05:16.620> dirt

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
terrain but we we don't have the dirt

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.280 
terrain but we we don't have the dirt
now<00:05:17.790> to<00:05:17.910> get<00:05:18.060> to<00:05:18.210> the<00:05:18.300> dirt<00:05:18.450> this<00:05:18.780> is<00:05:18.930> actually

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
now to get to the dirt this is actually

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.350 
now to get to the dirt this is actually
probably<00:05:19.860> the<00:05:20.280> fun<00:05:20.490> part<00:05:20.760> even<00:05:21.150> though<00:05:21.240> it's

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
probably the fun part even though it's

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.210 
probably the fun part even though it's
not<00:05:21.510> very<00:05:21.630> fun<00:05:21.960> what<00:05:22.770> you're<00:05:22.890> going<00:05:23.010> to<00:05:23.070> do<00:05:23.130> is

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
not very fun what you're going to do is

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.640 
not very fun what you're going to do is
you're<00:05:23.280> going<00:05:23.400> to<00:05:23.520> hit<00:05:23.610> the<00:05:23.910> letter<00:05:24.690> U<00:05:24.990> and<00:05:25.169> the

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
you're going to hit the letter U and the

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.640 
you're going to hit the letter U and the
letter<00:05:25.860> L<00:05:26.100> and<00:05:26.580> that<00:05:27.330> gives<00:05:27.510> you<00:05:27.750> a<00:05:27.930> loop

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
letter L and that gives you a loop

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:29.990 
letter L and that gives you a loop
selection<00:05:28.950> tool<00:05:29.430> I<00:05:29.550> believe<00:05:29.790> it's<00:05:29.940> called

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
selection tool I believe it's called
