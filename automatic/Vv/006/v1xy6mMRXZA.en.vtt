00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:10.000
 in the second part of our little hesse 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:13.179
 Courier series is about the function of 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.630
 main chamber that about one to 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:18.940
 robbing is in front of the boiler and 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.520
 is usually due to the smoke 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:25.630
 door closed so we are 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:29.140
 now target came smoke the smoke of 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:32.349
 through the heating and through the smoke 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.380
 was from the fire department here in you too 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:38.460
 can get over here above 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:41.739
 chimney into the open air 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.290
 the smokers are the thicker rest 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.690
 they still have at most steam locomotives 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.670
 a special feature and that are 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.309
 in them overheating 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:55.469
 but these are now expanded here 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.469
 because they have to be renewed 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.650
 You will be confronted by heat pipes here 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.580
 just expanded we are too long like 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.580
 the whole box 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.090
 by coming in from the boiler 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:33.880
 fight is passes through these pipes 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.520
 this to the so-called hot steam and has 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.729
 a temperature of up to 400 degrees 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.729
 Celsius 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.520
 this simple procedure increases that 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:53.649
 efficiency of the steam locomotive 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:55.720
 Much of the superheated steam from the 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:59.950
 single super heat pipes will be here 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:02.380
 passed in the top of the map and 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.530
 over the two thick pipes flow 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.890
 directed to the two cylinders where the 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.230
 steam sets the piston in motion 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.810
 the steam from the cylinders is over 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.560
 the steam from straw here again in you 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.290
 also headed chambers and connect 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.450
 These two pipes come from here 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.180
 This stand is down here on the 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.360
 floor is located on the stand pipe 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:33.250
 usually still the blowpipe 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:35.549
 blowpipe has the function of the steam 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.650
 to push the chimney out 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:40.780
 This creates a negative pressure here in 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.120
 the whole smoke chambers and the whole 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.459
 smoke gases coming from the fire seats 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:50.500
 are torn up with 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:54.940
 the consequence of this is that in the fire 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:59.910
 bush a draft arises and the 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.910
 fire thereby oxygen is supplied
