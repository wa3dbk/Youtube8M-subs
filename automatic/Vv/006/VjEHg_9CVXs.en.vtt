00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 it is clear that they are consoling themselves 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.250
 for the moment with women's basketball 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.330
 while the rugby clermont him 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.670
 groom his wounds 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.320
 how to bounce back to continue to 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.000
 to exist is the whole question 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.710
 five days of a new test 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.830
 jean-luc rossi talks with 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.730
 AurÃ©lien rougerie of a return match 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.490
 good evening everyone we go 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.529
 come back on this cruel defeat of 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.449
 the asm in the final of h cup with aurelien 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.340
 blush good evening you feel a question 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.890
 first on the state of the troops the morale 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.420
 of your teammates a forced to 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.920
 next day of iron after this 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.329
 defeat but listen I will not lie 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.399
 I can say he is in good shape but 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.870
 good here we are we must now 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.750
 turn the page and turn to one 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.610
 to other heavens with after the match 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.950
 you had not spoken in the 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.320
 cloakroom it was a lot of milk from the 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.489
 anger and the disappointment of anger and 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.320
 and above all, the physiognomy of the match 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.260
 I believe like a lot of fans 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.460
 acted not really understand how this 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.760
 match could have escaped us 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.500
 good on two 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.329
 on the interference people without anything finally me 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.359
 proud there are plenty with if we redo 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.589
 the world so here is a lot of 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.250
 many questions that we tried 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:05.920
 of 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.060
 to target this morning yesterday here we have 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.250
 a lot talked about we exchanged a lot 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.850
 between us and then we will try to 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.460
 bounce 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.960
 that 's what you were finding desires 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.880
 to do a little update on 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.840
 this match to talk necessarily true 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.610
 since defeats like that 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.430
 good it does not happen every day 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.170
 and 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.000
 it's not a pleasure so it's at 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.850
 group obviously to the supporters on 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.110
 think about we think of everyone so 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.370
 this is not it's not a moment 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.530
 we love to live and this is the moment 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.479
 when we would like to target for 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.070
 never again the blackberries is the moment 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.110
 to go back to the reasons for this 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.700
 defeat complicated video session this morning 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.020
 I imagine anyway because we are reviewing 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.610
 the faults necessarily long and 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.590
 complicated but well that's all 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.729
 we often say when we win that the 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.200
 star is the team and when we lose 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.670
 it is also the time of the whole team 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.140
 so we all have each to lead our 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.910
 little by little to lose 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.110
 this game we still review the 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.790
 turning point of this match 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.000
 in any case this final at the time of 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.320
 coaching game with bernard winner 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.780
 laporte with the entry into play of Frederic 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.070
 michalak a contest a balloon won by 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.020
 the Toulons they won a few 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.520
 some on the ground like this and then michalak who 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.259
 play fast 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.030
 this action and that will bring a 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.070
 penalty is one of the first turns 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.840
 necessarily pretty yeah it's a balloon 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.160
 well recovered by information and 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.600
 by Toulouse 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.420
 we also have to gain pressure 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.910
 not either removed their match to 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.170
 go back and so here is with michalak 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.180
 who plays fast and who allows 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.950
 wilkinson in who is roundabout and yes 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.270
 it does not forgive the pack on 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.190
 wilkinson a penalty 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.190
 and then this action that will bring 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.560
 leave in the 64th minute 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.880
 there too you can handle the score you 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.230
 do not manage you choose to play 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.240
 still explained noah a little bit the 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.520
 unreasonable whether managed score yes 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.020
 Unmanaged it mean to be kept 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.350
 the ball be careful to give it 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.510
 opponents played at the foot that's for 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.710
 for unfortunately given the ball to 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.690
 the opponent for whom the recovery is 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.910
 who 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.550
 we are strong but hey that's it 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.810
 put to defend so it's difficult 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.520
 we must find the right balance and 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.290
 that's where we still have a lot 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.129
 working at 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.060
 to provide with the wrong gesture of 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:03.810
 the hermitage that you will certainly have 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.090
 want to find 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.829
 why not in the final and yet you 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.629
 did the hard part in this match you 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.849
 had dominated this team at the level of 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:15.720
 possession at the occupation level 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:18.599
 also impressive stats 68% 75 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.159
 % of occupation two tries blow by blow 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:23.879
 at the beginning of the second quarter of an hour 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:25.349
 says the match is played pretty much but 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.730
 maybe you say a little too much that too 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:28.139
 you subterranean may have said 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.269
 unconsciously for sure there is a 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:32.159
 some we let go with the arrival of 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.079
 two tests early in the second 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:36.370
 early second period let's talk so 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.900
 sometimes you just have to 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.330
 to say that a rugby match is not 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:44.470
 an hour but those 80 minutes and we have 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.280
 our faults can not really 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.810
 put the head under the water of 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.930
 the opponent when he has to press there 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.739
 where it hurts so I have a lot of 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.060
 a lot of regrets there are a lot of 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.099
 things coming back but hey the 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.239
 last last year we fail in 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:56.379
 semi final this year in the final 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.019
 I hope that next year will be the 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:01.420
 good then necessarily when we review the 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.920
 match movie also toulon leads from a 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.420
 there is a quarter of an hour left to play 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.129
 it's still a quarter 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.690
 hour but the team can not find the 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:09.400
 resources for brock james leave the 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.099
 lawn you too are you on the good 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.329
 you come back from injury and he's 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:15.579
 the team can not find the solutions 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:18.359
 despite this attempt to drop in the end 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:20.280
 david this case there is the impression that 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.719
 it's a collective plunge for the end 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.759
 to match a name a bit we try to 

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:26.370
 find resources and 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:28.889
 keep to keep the balloon for for 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.539
 to blame it is Toulon who 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:32.789
 were very disciplined apparently 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:35.099
 so that's it needed more than 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:36.539
 you had to try to try 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:37.870
 something we tried to put in 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:40.000
 place a 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.500
 a combination tries the drop after they 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.540
 have they identified that they have us 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.350
 countered so moment there it's also a 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.650
 good team of everyone who has 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.480
 won 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.520
 good necessarily for the public is very 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.110
 disappointing you may have noticed this 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.830
 immense public disappointment 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.510
 supporters who had made the 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.930
 displacement they were over 6000 to 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.780
 dublin 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.760
 some made a lot of sacrifices 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.080
 necessarily and place jaude also there 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.690
 had a big mobilization with close 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.920
 forty thousand people 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.750
 it's hard for people who follow you 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.490
 also think about the finals 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.020
 previous father of the national nation 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.520
 on the old demons come back well 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.770
 in the heads but hey that's it 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.680
 obviously think of them we think we think 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.000
 to any group that is as sad or 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.800
 certainly a lot sadder than 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.360
 some supporters so the moment there we 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.350
 think we think of all the people who 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.200
 love that they like this club and who 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:25.330
 love this sport that's all I have another 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.770
 another added the best way to 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.050
 to be forgiven this vague castres 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.780
 from Saturday night and that's to go to go 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.230
 look for victory the brennus ray 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.750
 that's what we said this morning 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:37.280
 so bring together the best way to get 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.960
 catch up is to turn to this 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.180
 semi final that awaits us with a 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.330
 castres team a little similar in 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.819
 the facts 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.280
 a Toulon team that manages as well 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:51.009
 their defense well in place that have a 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:53.110
 motor 1 person of coconut trees that is 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:54.460
 so formidable so good here we have them 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.830
 similarities we will play a team 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.659
 similar the week right after so at 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.979
 we make the right choices with a 

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:01.270
 asm team that will not turn 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:02.650
 necessarily maybe that vern cotter on 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.599
 will do the busy calling novels 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.909
 dear I do not know what I do not know we are 

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:08.830
 we are on the ground and we have already 

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:10.750
 a lot of things to do so I leave 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.110
 Coaching to compose 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.580
 team 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.259
 thank you aurelien we'll see that tomorrow 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:18.060
 obviously with the drive open to 

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:18.060
 the press tomorrow of Clermont
