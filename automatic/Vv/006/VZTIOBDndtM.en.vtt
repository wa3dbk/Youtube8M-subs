way<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.149> use<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.540> duck<00:00:33.750> but<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:35.090> decided<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.300> go

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
way to use the duck but I decided to go

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.270 
way to use the duck but I decided to go
with<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.690> stack<00:00:36.930> because<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.530> just<00:00:37.860> feel<00:00:38.070> like

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
with the stack because I just feel like

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.299 
with the stack because I just feel like
you<00:00:38.550> have<00:00:38.790> more<00:00:39.719> control<00:00:39.989> more<00:00:40.440> negation

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
you have more control more negation

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.990 
you have more control more negation
because<00:00:42.030> i'm<00:00:42.390> using<00:00:42.469> divine<00:00:43.469> punishment

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
because i'm using divine punishment

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.779 
because i'm using divine punishment
which<00:00:45.000> is<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.210> card<00:00:45.570> exclusive<00:00:46.410> if<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:47.579> use

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
which is a card exclusive if you use

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.389 
which is a card exclusive if you use
sanctuary<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.570> sky<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.230> i'm<00:00:50.100> going<00:00:50.340> to

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
sanctuary in the sky and i'm going to

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.189 
sanctuary in the sky and i'm going to
have<00:00:50.579> more<00:00:50.850> negation<00:00:51.420> cards<00:00:51.719> than<00:00:51.989> my

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
have more negation cards than my

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.100 
have more negation cards than my
opponent<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:53.100> odds<00:00:53.850> are<00:00:54.030> i'm<00:00:54.360> going<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:54.960> be

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
opponent so odds are i'm going to be

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.350 
opponent so odds are i'm going to be
wedding<00:00:55.440> as<00:00:55.620> long<00:00:55.949> as<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.280> can<00:00:56.340> keep<00:00:56.550> up<00:00:56.879> my

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
setups so let's just hop into the

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.880 
setups so let's just hop into the
decklist<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.750> by<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.230> way<00:01:01.440> this<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:01.680> a

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
decklist and by the way this is a

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.979 
decklist and by the way this is a
hundred<00:01:02.309> percent<00:01:02.430> form<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.270> for<00:01:03.510> those<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.719> you

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
like that's a decent number because once

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.109 
like that's a decent number because once
you<00:01:43.140> get<00:01:43.320> sanctuary<00:01:43.950> once<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.640> should<00:01:44.700> be

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
you get sanctuary once you should be

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.789 
you get sanctuary once you should be
pretty<00:01:45.360> much<00:01:45.659> good<00:01:45.930> because<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.439> have<00:01:46.560> so

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
pretty much good because you have so

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.219 
pretty much good because you have so
many<00:01:46.979> negation<00:01:47.640> cards<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.600> negate<00:01:49.200> your

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
many negation cards to negate your

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.160 
many negation cards to negate your
opponent's<00:01:49.970> destruction<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:51.720> just<00:01:51.990> feel

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
opponent's destruction so I just feel

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.719 
opponent's destruction so I just feel
like<00:01:52.320> that's<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.619> decent<00:01:52.829> number<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.460> mean<00:01:53.640> you

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
like that's a decent number I mean you

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.179 
like that's a decent number I mean you
can<00:01:53.909> use<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.329> as<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.479> beat<00:01:54.780> or<00:01:54.810> two<00:01:54.930> but<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:56.070> way

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
can use it as a beat or two but the way

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.160 
can use it as a beat or two but the way
I<00:01:56.219> just<00:01:56.610> see<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:56.850> if<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.119> somehow<00:01:57.450> don't<00:01:57.899> have

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
I just see it if you somehow don't have

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.280 
I just see it if you somehow don't have
this<00:01:58.320> sanctuary<00:01:58.710> then<00:01:59.640> I<00:02:00.390> mean<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:00.930> can<00:02:01.049> pitch

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
this sanctuary then I mean you can pitch

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.959 
this sanctuary then I mean you can pitch
us<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.649> get<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.920> sanctuary<00:02:02.460> but<00:02:02.640> let's<00:02:02.850> say

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
us to get the sanctuary but let's say

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.340 
us to get the sanctuary but let's say
you<00:02:03.000> don't<00:02:03.270> want<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.509> do<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:03.659> it's<00:02:04.079> a

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
you don't want to do that it's a

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.700 
you don't want to do that it's a
completely<00:02:04.770> dead<00:02:05.340> code<00:02:05.700> so<00:02:06.530> hopefully<00:02:07.530> that

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
completely dead code so hopefully that

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.650 
completely dead code so hopefully that
made<00:02:07.920> sense<00:02:07.950> but<00:02:08.520> that's<00:02:08.789> just<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.360> know<00:02:09.479> how

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
made sense but that's just you know how

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.020 
made sense but that's just you know how
I<00:02:09.690> think<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.770> Jupiter<00:02:11.160> really<00:02:11.550> cool<00:02:11.790> card

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
I think the Jupiter really cool card

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.580 
I think the Jupiter really cool card
with<00:02:12.390> sanctuary<00:02:12.959> you

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
with sanctuary you

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.280 
with sanctuary you
to<00:02:13.680> get<00:02:14.280> his<00:02:14.550> second<00:02:15.120> effect<00:02:15.390> and<00:02:15.690> you<00:02:16.170> know

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
to get his second effect and you know

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.699 
to get his second effect and you know
why<00:02:16.560> not<00:02:16.739> use<00:02:16.920> it<00:02:18.019> you're<00:02:19.019> not<00:02:19.260> going<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.560> see

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
why not use it you're not going to see

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.380 
why not use it you're not going to see
that<00:02:19.890> card<00:02:20.129> in<00:02:20.250> regular<00:02:20.670> agent<00:02:21.060> that's<00:02:21.209> just

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
that card in regular agent that's just

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.020 
that card in regular agent that's just
because<00:02:21.690> that<00:02:22.170> card<00:02:22.470> cannot<00:02:22.980> benefit<00:02:23.519> in<00:02:23.730> any

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
because that card cannot benefit in any

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.300 
because that card cannot benefit in any
way<00:02:24.330> possible<00:02:24.599> for<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.230> most<00:02:25.470> part<00:02:28.310> they

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
way possible for the most part they

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.009 
way possible for the most part they
think<00:02:29.610> you're<00:02:29.819> yeah<00:02:30.180> that<00:02:30.360> was<00:02:30.480> everything<00:02:30.750> on

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
think you're yeah that was everything on

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.380 
think you're yeah that was everything on
the<00:02:31.140> monsters<00:02:31.500> going<00:02:31.980> on<00:02:32.129> to<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.400> spells<00:02:32.700> to

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
the monsters going on to the spells to

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.780 
the monsters going on to the spells to
sanctuary<00:02:33.959> as<00:02:34.110> I<00:02:34.500> said<00:02:34.560> I<00:02:34.920> mean<00:02:35.129> once<00:02:35.370> you<00:02:35.549> get

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
sanctuary as I said I mean once you get

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.430 
sanctuary as I said I mean once you get
it<00:02:35.940> you<00:02:36.060> should<00:02:36.299> be<00:02:36.450> set<00:02:36.750> so<00:02:37.019> that's<00:02:37.230> why<00:02:37.410> I

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
it you should be set so that's why I

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.820 
it you should be set so that's why I
decided<00:02:37.650> not<00:02:38.220> to<00:02:38.400> go<00:02:38.549> with<00:02:38.580> it<00:02:39.560> three<00:02:40.560> copies

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
decided not to go with it three copies

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.520 
decided not to go with it three copies
so<00:02:41.010> I<00:02:41.760> mean<00:02:42.239> we'll<00:02:42.390> see<00:02:42.420> I<00:02:42.930> mean<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.260> stack<00:02:43.500> is
