is that this artkraft post actually Yam
had<00:00:11.849> some<00:00:12.030> videos<00:00:12.330> that<00:00:12.360> came<00:00:12.630> along<00:00:12.809> with<00:00:12.870> the

had some videos that came along with the
two<00:00:13.200> which<00:00:13.349> is<00:00:13.500> really<00:00:13.830> quite<00:00:14.219> nice<00:00:14.370> to<00:00:14.610> see

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
two which is really quite nice to see

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.939 
two which is really quite nice to see
and<00:00:15.030> it's<00:00:15.570> all<00:00:15.719> well<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:15.960> good<00:00:16.139> seeing<00:00:16.560> like

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
and it's all well and good seeing like

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.950 
and it's all well and good seeing like
pictures<00:00:17.460> of<00:00:17.640> these<00:00:17.760> models<00:00:18.150> but<00:00:18.570> seeing<00:00:18.840> them

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
pictures of these models but seeing them

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.450 
pictures of these models but seeing them
in<00:00:19.080> motion<00:00:19.289> is<00:00:19.590> really<00:00:19.830> what<00:00:19.949> ties<00:00:20.189> it<00:00:20.369> all

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
in motion is really what ties it all

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.759 
in motion is really what ties it all
together<00:00:20.689> so<00:00:21.689> I'm<00:00:22.109> basically<00:00:22.260> just<00:00:22.470> going<00:00:22.710> to

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
together so I'm basically just going to

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.500 
together so I'm basically just going to
have<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:22.949> better<00:00:23.250> do<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.699> bit<00:00:23.850> of<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:24.000> summary<00:00:24.210> of

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
have a better do a bit of a summary of

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.870 
have a better do a bit of a summary of
what<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:25.050> Blizzard<00:00:25.890> staff<00:00:26.160> said<00:00:26.519> I'm<00:00:26.820> just

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
what the Blizzard staff said I'm just

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.550 
what the Blizzard staff said I'm just
who<00:00:27.330> can<00:00:27.510> really<00:00:27.630> get<00:00:27.810> their<00:00:27.960> perspective<00:00:28.470> and

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
who can really get their perspective and

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.660 
who can really get their perspective and
then<00:00:28.650> in<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.830> background<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.340> course<00:00:29.490> you'll

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
then in the background of course you'll

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.179 
then in the background of course you'll
see<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.910> Turin<00:00:30.179> model<00:00:30.480> alright<00:00:31.349> so<00:00:31.679> this<00:00:31.920> post

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
see the Turin model alright so this post

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.830 
see the Turin model alright so this post
comes<00:00:32.520> from<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.790> animation<00:00:33.360> team<00:00:33.570> rather

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
comes from the animation team rather

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.959 
comes from the animation team rather
than<00:00:34.110> being<00:00:34.320> from<00:00:34.649> say<00:00:35.219> chris<00:00:35.489> Robertson

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
than being from say chris Robertson

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.910 
than being from say chris Robertson
himself<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.840> seems<00:00:36.899> like<00:00:37.170> chris<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.500> more<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.829> a

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
himself it seems like chris is more of a

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.100 
himself it seems like chris is more of a
just<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.219> raw<00:00:38.430> art<00:00:38.700> guy<00:00:38.940> whereas<00:00:39.540> this<00:00:39.719> the

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
just a raw art guy whereas this the

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.750 
just a raw art guy whereas this the
animation<00:00:40.530> team<00:00:40.620> stuff<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.040> perhaps<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.520> step

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
animation team stuff is perhaps a step

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.840 
animation team stuff is perhaps a step
ahead<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.500> you<00:00:43.500> know<00:00:43.620> after<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.219> main

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
ahead of that you know after the main

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.330 
ahead of that you know after the main
artwork<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.539> done<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.989> basically<00:00:46.920> first<00:00:47.219> of

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
artwork is done and basically first of

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.170 
artwork is done and basically first of
all<00:00:47.399> they<00:00:47.550> said<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:47.879> what<00:00:48.030> they<00:00:48.149> really

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
all they said that what they really

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.060 
all they said that what they really
needed<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.780> do<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.260> clean<00:00:49.590> up<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.890> base

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
needed to do is clean up the base

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.610 
needed to do is clean up the base
animations<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.480> they<00:00:51.690> imported<00:00:52.230> all<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.500> old

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
animations so they imported all the old

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.529 
animations so they imported all the old
ones<00:00:52.829> in<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.399> apply<00:00:53.699> them<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.059> new<00:00:54.180> model

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
ones in and apply them to the new model

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.150 
ones in and apply them to the new model
and<00:00:54.690> then<00:00:55.020> basically<00:00:55.350> just<00:00:55.620> got<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:56.010> work

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
and then basically just got to work

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.250 
and then basically just got to work
fixing<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.850> up<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.210> making<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.660> work<00:00:57.930> with<00:00:58.140> the

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
fixing it up and making it work with the

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.110 
fixing it up and making it work with the
new<00:00:58.410> animation<00:00:58.800> rigs<00:00:59.160> they<00:00:59.699> improved<00:01:00.030> the

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
new animation rigs they improved the

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.939 
new animation rigs they improved the
base<00:01:00.270> time<00:01:00.539> animation<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.289> then<00:01:01.410> from<00:01:01.770> that

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
base time animation and then from that

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.509 
base time animation and then from that
went<00:01:02.160> on<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.930> reanimate<00:01:03.930> its<00:01:04.379> idle<00:01:04.979> animation

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
went on to reanimate its idle animation

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.490 
went on to reanimate its idle animation
and<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.670> few<00:01:05.820> other<00:01:05.970> things<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.479> they<00:01:07.200> did<00:01:07.350> that

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
and a few other things and they did that

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.260 
and a few other things and they did that
by<00:01:07.680> changing<00:01:07.979> how<00:01:08.250> muscles<00:01:08.670> move<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.180> how

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
by changing how muscles move and how

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.330 
by changing how muscles move and how
limbs<00:01:09.570> are<00:01:09.810> carried<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.380> overall<00:01:11.010> what<00:01:11.189> they

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
limbs are carried and overall what they

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.100 
limbs are carried and overall what they
should<00:01:11.580> do<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:11.939> just<00:01:12.180> make<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.630> model<00:01:13.020> will

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
should do is just make the model will

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.350 
should do is just make the model will
feel<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.650> lot<00:01:13.920> more<00:01:13.950> weighty<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.640> beefy<00:01:15.030> of

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
feel a lot more weighty and beefy of

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.060 
feel a lot more weighty and beefy of
course<00:01:15.630> it's<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.869> tauren<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:16.590> absolutely

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
course it's a tauren so that absolutely

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.410 
course it's a tauren so that absolutely
makes<00:01:17.280> sense<00:01:17.460> they<00:01:17.790> should<00:01:18.060> feel<00:01:18.270> extremely

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
makes sense they should feel extremely

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.870 
makes sense they should feel extremely
just<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.619> know<00:01:19.740> like<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:19.979> they<00:01:20.430> have<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.640> lot<00:01:20.850> of

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
just you know like a they have a lot of

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.480 
just you know like a they have a lot of
mass<00:01:21.180> essentially<00:01:22.220> another<00:01:23.220> thing<00:01:23.400> they

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
mass essentially another thing they

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.340 
mass essentially another thing they
realized<00:01:23.850> too<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.900> face<00:01:25.080> really

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
realized too is that the face really

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.840 
realized too is that the face really
didn't<00:01:25.740> look<00:01:25.830> too<00:01:26.040> good<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.400> not<00:01:26.520> just<00:01:26.729> from

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
didn't look too good and not just from

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.850 
didn't look too good and not just from
an<00:01:27.000> artistic<00:01:27.270> perspective<00:01:27.630> but<00:01:28.470> even<00:01:28.710> with

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
an artistic perspective but even with

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.800 
an artistic perspective but even with
the<00:01:29.009> update<00:01:29.310> textures<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.060> just<00:01:30.420> didn't<00:01:30.659> feel

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
the update textures it just didn't feel

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.300 
the update textures it just didn't feel
that<00:01:31.049> great<00:01:31.290> because<00:01:31.560> there<00:01:31.950> was<00:01:32.040> things<00:01:32.250> like

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
that great because there was things like

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.340 
that great because there was things like
nose<00:01:32.640> rings<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.210> braids<00:01:33.479> which<00:01:33.990> in<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.229> old

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
nose rings and braids which in the old

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.410 
nose rings and braids which in the old
model<00:01:34.560> didn't<00:01:35.009> move<00:01:35.159> or<00:01:35.610> anything<00:01:35.939> like<00:01:36.150> that

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
model didn't move or anything like that

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.359 
model didn't move or anything like that
well<00:01:37.020> they've<00:01:37.140> now<00:01:37.259> updated<00:01:37.740> all<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:37.979> those<00:01:38.159> so

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
well they've now updated all of those so

well they've now updated all of those so
that<00:01:38.729> yes<00:01:39.270> they<00:01:39.450> react<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.650> models

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
that yes they react to the models

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.249 
that yes they react to the models
movement<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:42.540> should<00:01:42.750> look<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:42.960> lot<00:01:43.079> more

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
movement that should look a lot more

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.929 
movement that should look a lot more
convincing<00:01:43.560> actually<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.490> it's<00:01:44.640> just<00:01:44.820> all

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
together just to make the model look a

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.719 
together just to make the model look a
whole<00:01:48.960> lot<00:01:49.200> better<00:01:49.380> because<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.250> mean<00:01:50.460> yeah

they actually fix the faces as well so
in<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.049> past<00:02:07.229> character<00:02:07.680> models<00:02:08.009> only<00:02:08.280> had

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
in the past character models only had

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.270 
in the past character models only had
basically<00:02:09.569> a<00:02:09.690> jaw<00:02:09.959> bone<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.470> be<00:02:10.590> animated

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
basically a jaw bone to be animated

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.040 
basically a jaw bone to be animated
of<00:02:11.580> course<00:02:11.970> now<00:02:12.180> they've<00:02:12.540> got<00:02:12.810> a<00:02:12.840> lot<00:02:13.020> more

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
of course now they've got a lot more

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.430 
of course now they've got a lot more
than

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
than

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.590 
than
can<00:02:13.530> add<00:02:13.650> movement<00:02:14.070> to<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.250> eyebrows<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:14.940> the

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
can add movement to the eyebrows and the

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.840 
can add movement to the eyebrows and the
eyes<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:16.170> cheeks<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.770> mouth<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.280> with

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
eyes the cheeks and the mouth and with

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.010 
eyes the cheeks and the mouth and with
that<00:02:18.090> they've<00:02:18.240> been<00:02:18.360> able<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:18.630> make<00:02:18.840> the

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
that they've been able to make the

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.960 
that they've been able to make the
models<00:02:19.350> properly<00:02:19.770> smile<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.340> kangri<00:02:20.730> talk

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
models properly smile the kangri talk

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.000 
models properly smile the kangri talk
and<00:02:21.120> that<00:02:21.210> kind<00:02:21.480> of<00:02:21.570> thing<00:02:21.780> so<00:02:22.440> basically<00:02:22.650> this

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
and that kind of thing so basically this

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.890 
and that kind of thing so basically this
new<00:02:23.250> system<00:02:23.730> gives<00:02:23.970> them<00:02:24.120> a<00:02:24.180> lot<00:02:24.360> more<00:02:24.540> control

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
new system gives them a lot more control

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.930 
new system gives them a lot more control
and<00:02:25.560> some<00:02:26.070> of<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.220> tools<00:02:26.430> that<00:02:26.550> they've<00:02:26.730> made

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
and some of the tools that they've made

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.350 
and some of the tools that they've made
allow<00:02:27.300> them<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.630> have<00:02:28.340> just<00:02:29.340> that<00:02:29.520> well<00:02:30.120> they

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
allow them to have just that well they

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.850 
allow them to have just that well they
just<00:02:30.390> have<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.750> capability<00:02:31.320> to<00:02:31.350> make<00:02:31.470> more

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
just have the capability to make more

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.920 
just have the capability to make more
unique<00:02:32.340> animations<00:02:33.030> in<00:02:33.210> an<00:02:33.300> easier<00:02:33.630> fashion

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
unique animations in an easier fashion

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.710 
unique animations in an easier fashion
and<00:02:34.440> basically<00:02:35.250> they<00:02:35.490> can<00:02:35.700> save<00:02:35.970> presets<00:02:36.480> and

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
and basically they can save presets and

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.330 
and basically they can save presets and
then<00:02:36.810> just<00:02:37.020> start<00:02:37.170> tweaking<00:02:37.410> from<00:02:37.740> there<00:02:37.890> it

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
then just start tweaking from there it

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.490 
then just start tweaking from there it
almost<00:02:38.610> sounds<00:02:38.970> like<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.480> make<00:02:39.660> an<00:02:39.870> ultra

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
almost sounds like to make an ultra

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.680 
almost sounds like to make an ultra
unique<00:02:41.340> animation<00:02:42.150> with<00:02:42.270> the<00:02:42.360> old<00:02:42.480> system

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
unique animation with the old system

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.960 
unique animation with the old system
they<00:02:43.260> would<00:02:43.410> really<00:02:43.800> just<00:02:44.040> need<00:02:44.220> kind<00:02:44.820> of<00:02:44.850> like

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
they would really just need kind of like

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.460 
they would really just need kind of like
need<00:02:45.120> to<00:02:45.150> hack<00:02:45.390> it<00:02:45.570> together<00:02:45.870> whereas<00:02:46.320> this

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
need to hack it together whereas this

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.950 
need to hack it together whereas this
system<00:02:46.920> better<00:02:47.490> supports<00:02:48.030> that<00:02:48.180> if<00:02:48.480> you<00:02:48.810> don't

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
system better supports that if you don't

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.060 
system better supports that if you don't
know<00:02:49.050> by<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.260> way<00:02:49.410> they<00:02:49.620> added<00:02:49.950> a<00:02:50.040> new

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
know by the way they added a new

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.040 
know by the way they added a new
animation<00:02:50.640> system<00:02:51.030> in<00:02:51.150> with<00:02:51.360> Missa<00:02:51.630> Pont<00:02:51.900> aeri

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
animation system in with Missa Pont aeri

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.470 
animation system in with Missa Pont aeri
afore<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.620> Pandaren<00:02:53.010> model<00:02:53.490> and<00:02:53.640> they're

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
afore the Pandaren model and they're

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.180 
afore the Pandaren model and they're
porting<00:02:54.840> all<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.080> old<00:02:55.200> models<00:02:55.560> across<00:02:55.920> to

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
porting all the old models across to

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.390 
porting all the old models across to
that<00:02:56.220> in<00:02:56.610> terms<00:02:56.850> of<00:02:57.000> their<00:02:57.120> animation<00:02:57.480> quality

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
that in terms of their animation quality

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.890 
that in terms of their animation quality
alright<00:02:59.400> so<00:02:59.550> next<00:02:59.700> they<00:03:00.270> went<00:03:00.450> into<00:03:00.600> a<00:03:00.660> little

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
alright so next they went into a little

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.020 
alright so next they went into a little
bit<00:03:00.990> of<00:03:01.080> detail<00:03:01.440> about<00:03:01.950> how<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.160> updated<00:03:02.820> run

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
bit of detail about how the updated run

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.270 
bit of detail about how the updated run
cycle<00:03:03.330> is<00:03:03.570> going<00:03:03.780> to<00:03:03.870> work<00:03:04.160> essentially<00:03:05.160> the

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
cycle is going to work essentially the

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.790 
cycle is going to work essentially the
new<00:03:05.400> animation<00:03:05.880> system<00:03:06.270> allows<00:03:06.510> them<00:03:06.780> to<00:03:07.020> do<00:03:07.770> a

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
new animation system allows them to do a

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.040 
new animation system allows them to do a
lot<00:03:08.010> just<00:03:08.580> a<00:03:08.640> better<00:03:08.970> job<00:03:09.330> reading<00:03:09.660> it<00:03:09.720> makes

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
lot just a better job reading it makes

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.410 
lot just a better job reading it makes
it<00:03:10.260> a<00:03:10.290> far<00:03:10.530> easier<00:03:10.740> to<00:03:10.920> touch<00:03:11.280> up<00:03:11.520> many<00:03:11.760> aspects

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
it a far easier to touch up many aspects

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.360 
it a far easier to touch up many aspects
of<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.660> animation<00:03:13.140> so<00:03:13.710> basically<00:03:14.070> they<00:03:14.340> just

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
of the animation so basically they just

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.680 
of the animation so basically they just
talked<00:03:14.730> about<00:03:14.910> how<00:03:15.000> they<00:03:15.120> use<00:03:15.300> controller

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
talked about how they use controller

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.630 
talked about how they use controller
curves<00:03:16.020> and<00:03:16.290> various<00:03:16.650> things<00:03:16.830> like<00:03:16.920> that<00:03:17.040> to

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
curves and various things like that to

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.340 
curves and various things like that to
manipulate<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.300> joints<00:03:18.690> of<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:18.870> model<00:03:19.230> and

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
manipulate the joints of the model and

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.190 
manipulate the joints of the model and
just<00:03:19.410> tweak<00:03:20.130> it<00:03:20.280> in<00:03:20.370> a<00:03:20.430> lot<00:03:20.580> more<00:03:20.610> detail<00:03:21.209> so

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
just tweak it in a lot more detail so

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.900 
just tweak it in a lot more detail so
they<00:03:22.440> could<00:03:22.620> fix<00:03:22.800> it<00:03:22.980> up<00:03:23.100> and<00:03:23.340> then<00:03:23.730> another

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
they could fix it up and then another

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.400 
they could fix it up and then another
thing<00:03:24.180> that<00:03:24.239> they<00:03:24.480> did<00:03:24.660> was<00:03:24.690> they<00:03:24.989> went<00:03:25.110> back

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
thing that they did was they went back

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.040 
thing that they did was they went back
and<00:03:25.709> they<00:03:26.310> deleted<00:03:26.610> quite<00:03:27.030> a<00:03:27.060> few<00:03:27.390> of<00:03:27.660> the<00:03:27.810> old

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
and they deleted quite a few of the old

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.100 
and they deleted quite a few of the old
elements<00:03:28.530> from<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.830> old<00:03:28.950> animations<00:03:29.520> and

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
elements from the old animations and

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.060 
elements from the old animations and
basically<00:03:31.110> that<00:03:31.230> just<00:03:31.410> gave<00:03:31.770> them<00:03:31.890> more

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
basically that just gave them more

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.520 
basically that just gave them more
control<00:03:32.250> and<00:03:32.670> freed<00:03:32.880> up<00:03:33.030> the<00:03:33.660> animation<00:03:34.380> and

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
control and freed up the animation and

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.110 
control and freed up the animation and
controller<00:03:34.950> curves<00:03:35.280> so<00:03:35.610> they<00:03:35.760> could<00:03:35.940> really

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
controller curves so they could really

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.020 
controller curves so they could really
just<00:03:36.360> go<00:03:36.540> in<00:03:36.690> depth<00:03:36.959> and<00:03:37.230> make<00:03:38.010> changes<00:03:38.820> which

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
just go in depth and make changes which

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.510 
just go in depth and make changes which
were<00:03:39.180> a<00:03:39.209> lot<00:03:39.720> more<00:03:39.900> precise<00:03:40.500> what<00:03:41.250> should<00:03:41.430> this

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
were a lot more precise what should this

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.220 
were a lot more precise what should this
do<00:03:41.700> overall<00:03:42.030> well<00:03:42.420> it's<00:03:42.690> just<00:03:42.840> they're

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
do overall well it's just they're

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.840 
do overall well it's just they're
they're<00:03:43.560> getting<00:03:43.769> a<00:03:43.830> little<00:03:43.950> bit<00:03:44.190> more<00:03:44.370> sore

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
they're getting a little bit more sore

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.970 
they're getting a little bit more sore
down<00:03:45.090> and<00:03:45.300> dirty<00:03:45.450> with<00:03:45.660> the<00:03:45.720> model<00:03:46.080> and<00:03:46.170> this

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
down and dirty with the model and this

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.520 
down and dirty with the model and this
is<00:03:47.100> going<00:03:47.280> to<00:03:47.489> hopefully<00:03:47.790> give<00:03:48.720> us<00:03:48.750> higher

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
is going to hopefully give us higher

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.250 
is going to hopefully give us higher
fidelity<00:03:49.800> animations<00:03:50.790> that<00:03:50.940> not<00:03:51.900> only<00:03:52.140> the

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
fidelity animations that not only the

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.690 
fidelity animations that not only the
animations<00:03:52.680> more<00:03:52.860> smooth<00:03:53.190> but<00:03:53.400> there's<00:03:53.550> more

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
animations more smooth but there's more

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.130 
animations more smooth but there's more
things<00:03:53.850> moving<00:03:54.269> at<00:03:54.360> once<00:03:54.540> it's<00:03:54.720> all<00:03:54.840> in<00:03:54.870> a<00:03:54.959> very

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
things moving at once it's all in a very

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.740 
things moving at once it's all in a very
convincing<00:03:55.380> manner<00:03:55.739> and<00:03:56.340> yeah<00:03:57.000> you're<00:03:57.480> from

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
convincing manner and yeah you're from

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.540 
convincing manner and yeah you're from
that<00:03:57.780> footage<00:03:58.290> that<00:03:58.500> you're<00:03:58.890> you<00:03:59.250> know<00:03:59.340> that's

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
that footage that you're you know that's

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:00.530 
that footage that you're you know that's
being<00:03:59.700> shown<00:03:59.880> to<00:03:59.910> you<00:04:00.060> in<00:04:00.090> the<00:04:00.180> background

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
being shown to you in the background

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.020 
being shown to you in the background
there<00:04:00.720> I<00:04:00.900> think<00:04:01.350> that<00:04:01.620> it<00:04:01.860> does<00:04:02.160> look<00:04:02.580> a<00:04:02.760> lot

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
there I think that it does look a lot

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.750 
there I think that it does look a lot
better<00:04:03.269> really<00:04:03.720> it<00:04:03.989> definitely<00:04:04.440> does<00:04:04.620> and<00:04:04.950> so

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
better really it definitely does and so

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.490 
better really it definitely does and so
yeah<00:04:06.000> that's<00:04:06.150> good<00:04:06.450> now<00:04:06.690> next<00:04:06.900> they<00:04:07.140> said<00:04:07.350> that

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
yeah that's good now next they said that

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.750 
yeah that's good now next they said that
for<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:07.800> majority<00:04:08.100> of<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:08.400> character

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
for the majority of the character

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.060 
for the majority of the character
cleanup<00:04:09.120> phase<00:04:09.360> the<00:04:09.870> team<00:04:10.080> focuses<00:04:10.590> on<00:04:10.620> three

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
cleanup phase the team focuses on three

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.400 
cleanup phase the team focuses on three
main<00:04:11.250> things<00:04:11.489> cloth<00:04:12.180> hair<00:04:12.600> and<00:04:12.870> then<00:04:13.019> the<00:04:13.170> face

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
main things cloth hair and then the face

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.410 
main things cloth hair and then the face
this<00:04:13.980> is<00:04:14.160> in<00:04:14.280> terms<00:04:14.459> of<00:04:14.640> animations<00:04:15.120> remember

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
this is in terms of animations remember

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.539 
this is in terms of animations remember
not<00:04:15.570> just<00:04:15.600> in<00:04:16.109> terms<00:04:16.260> of<00:04:16.470> the<00:04:16.530> raw<00:04:16.680> art<00:04:16.950> so

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
not just in terms of the raw art so

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.430 
not just in terms of the raw art so
cloth<00:04:17.850> includes<00:04:18.299> things<00:04:18.570> like<00:04:18.750> the<00:04:18.900> front<00:04:19.260> and

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
cloth includes things like the front and

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.710 
cloth includes things like the front and
back<00:04:19.590> tabards<00:04:20.100> and<00:04:20.340> the<00:04:20.430> cape<00:04:20.669> and<00:04:20.880> then<00:04:21.390> hair

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
back tabards and the cape and then hair

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.719 
back tabards and the cape and then hair
can<00:04:21.930> be<00:04:21.960> anything<00:04:22.289> from<00:04:22.590> a<00:04:22.710> back<00:04:23.039> to<00:04:23.550> back

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
can be anything from a back to back

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.850 
can be anything from a back to back
ponytail<00:04:24.270> to<00:04:24.450> a<00:04:24.479> front<00:04:24.720> ponytail<00:04:25.229> to<00:04:25.440> pigtails

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
ponytail to a front ponytail to pigtails

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.560 
ponytail to a front ponytail to pigtails
so

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
so

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.380 
so
two<00:04:27.020> beards<00:04:27.440> of<00:04:27.620> varying<00:04:27.950> sizes<00:04:28.280> or<00:04:28.700> perhaps<00:04:29.120> a

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
two beards of varying sizes or perhaps a

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.690 
two beards of varying sizes or perhaps a
combination<00:04:29.690> of<00:04:30.350> all<00:04:30.650> of<00:04:30.680> them<00:04:30.890> and<00:04:31.100> then<00:04:31.520> also

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
combination of all of them and then also

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.850 
combination of all of them and then also
they<00:04:31.940> add<00:04:32.120> more<00:04:32.450> facial<00:04:32.660> animations<00:04:33.260> which<00:04:33.500> of

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
they add more facial animations which of

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.050 
they add more facial animations which of
course<00:04:34.100> I<00:04:34.190> was<00:04:34.280> a<00:04:34.310> lot<00:04:34.430> more<00:04:34.460> character<00:04:35.030> and

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
course I was a lot more character and

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.850 
course I was a lot more character and
just<00:04:35.300> brings<00:04:35.480> the<00:04:35.600> model<00:04:35.900> to<00:04:36.050> life<00:04:36.200> and<00:04:36.710> then

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
just brings the model to life and then

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.380 
just brings the model to life and then
occasionally<00:04:37.340> they<00:04:37.520> will<00:04:37.670> fix<00:04:37.940> some<00:04:38.180> minor

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
occasionally they will fix some minor

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.330 
occasionally they will fix some minor
posing<00:04:38.840> issues<00:04:39.200> or<00:04:39.380> errors<00:04:39.770> like<00:04:39.950> chittering

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
posing issues or errors like chittering

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.300 
posing issues or errors like chittering
and<00:04:40.700> that<00:04:41.510> kind<00:04:41.780> of<00:04:41.870> thing<00:04:42.110> now<00:04:42.770> animation

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
and that kind of thing now animation

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.770 
and that kind of thing now animation
wise<00:04:43.460> they<00:04:43.760> said<00:04:43.970> that<00:04:44.120> nothing<00:04:44.240> is<00:04:44.540> really

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
wise they said that nothing is really

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.080 
wise they said that nothing is really
dynamic<00:04:45.050> like<00:04:45.830> dynamically<00:04:46.370> handled<00:04:46.820> by<00:04:47.030> the

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
dynamic like dynamically handled by the

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.050 
dynamic like dynamically handled by the
engine<00:04:47.750> it's<00:04:48.170> all<00:04:48.350> hand<00:04:48.590> crafted<00:04:48.830> and<00:04:49.280> I<00:04:49.820> guess

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
engine it's all hand crafted and I guess

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.730 
engine it's all hand crafted and I guess
this<00:04:50.300> could<00:04:50.510> be<00:04:50.630> a<00:04:50.660> downside<00:04:51.170> to<00:04:51.200> some<00:04:51.470> games

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
this could be a downside to some games

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.200 
this could be a downside to some games
that<00:04:52.040> are<00:04:52.250> trying<00:04:52.430> to<00:04:52.550> go<00:04:52.640> for<00:04:52.670> ultra<00:04:53.090> high

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
that are trying to go for ultra high

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.880 
that are trying to go for ultra high
fidelity<00:04:53.420> but<00:04:54.200> for<00:04:54.380> something<00:04:54.650> that<00:04:54.770> is

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:54.890 
fidelity but for something that is

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:56.440 
fidelity but for something that is
trying<00:04:55.100> to<00:04:55.130> go<00:04:55.280> for<00:04:55.490> a<00:04:55.520> lot<00:04:55.670> more<00:04:55.940> just<00:04:56.210> raw

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
trying to go for a lot more just raw

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.450 
trying to go for a lot more just raw
style<00:04:56.870> I<00:04:57.110> think<00:04:57.140> that<00:04:57.470> for<00:04:57.650> for<00:04:58.280> world

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
style I think that for for world

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.240 
style I think that for for world
warcraft<00:04:59.000> this<00:04:59.780> gives<00:05:00.080> it<00:05:00.200> a<00:05:00.290> strong<00:05:00.560> sort<00:05:01.190> of

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
warcraft this gives it a strong sort of

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.580 
warcraft this gives it a strong sort of
handcrafted<00:05:01.580> feel<00:05:02.090> and<00:05:02.990> when<00:05:03.200> you<00:05:03.290> just<00:05:03.380> look

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
handcrafted feel and when you just look

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:04.840 
handcrafted feel and when you just look
at<00:05:03.680> the<00:05:03.770> models<00:05:04.130> and<00:05:04.280> look<00:05:04.370> how<00:05:04.520> they're<00:05:04.670> even

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.850 
at the models and look how they're even

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.610 
at the models and look how they're even
doing<00:05:05.060> shading<00:05:05.540> by<00:05:06.020> painting<00:05:06.320> onto<00:05:06.470> the

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
doing shading by painting onto the

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.990 
doing shading by painting onto the
textures<00:05:07.040> and<00:05:07.220> things<00:05:07.250> like<00:05:07.490> that<00:05:07.700> it

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
textures and things like that it

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.910 
textures and things like that it
definitely<00:05:08.390> does<00:05:08.780> sort<00:05:09.350> of<00:05:09.410> emanate<00:05:09.740> this

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:09.920 
definitely does sort of emanate this

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.830 
definitely does sort of emanate this
kind<00:05:10.160> of<00:05:10.190> whole<00:05:10.340> handcrafted<00:05:11.330> vibe<00:05:11.510> that<00:05:11.780> I

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
kind of whole handcrafted vibe that I

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.870 
kind of whole handcrafted vibe that I
think<00:05:12.170> adds<00:05:12.410> a<00:05:12.620> lot<00:05:12.770> of<00:05:12.830> charm<00:05:12.980> and<00:05:13.490> that<00:05:13.580> charm

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
think adds a lot of charm and that charm

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.360 
think adds a lot of charm and that charm
really<00:05:14.090> is<00:05:14.270> key<00:05:14.540> to<00:05:15.110> pulling<00:05:15.440> it<00:05:15.590> off<00:05:15.740> all

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
really is key to pulling it off all

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:17.740 
really is key to pulling it off all
right<00:05:16.550> so<00:05:16.730> next<00:05:16.880> they<00:05:17.090> talked<00:05:17.300> a<00:05:17.390> little<00:05:17.510> bit

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
right so next they talked a little bit

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.540 
right so next they talked a little bit
about<00:05:17.930> the<00:05:18.110> workload<00:05:18.680> and<00:05:18.920> getting<00:05:19.340> things

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
about the workload and getting things

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.580 
about the workload and getting things
done<00:05:19.820> for<00:05:20.060> warlords<00:05:20.510> basically<00:05:21.230> they<00:05:21.350> had<00:05:21.500> to

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
done for warlords basically they had to

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.200 
done for warlords basically they had to
prioritize<00:05:22.070> a<00:05:22.130> little<00:05:22.250> bit<00:05:22.670> because<00:05:22.880> they

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
prioritize a little bit because they

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:24.520 
prioritize a little bit because they
want<00:05:23.360> to<00:05:23.420> have<00:05:23.540> all<00:05:23.690> the<00:05:23.810> player<00:05:23.990> models<00:05:24.320> done

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
want to have all the player models done

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.290 
want to have all the player models done
by<00:05:24.680> the<00:05:24.740> time<00:05:24.920> warlords<00:05:25.370> comes<00:05:25.610> then<00:05:26.120> they

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
by the time warlords comes then they

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.600 
by the time warlords comes then they
need<00:05:26.480> to<00:05:26.510> animate<00:05:27.410> all<00:05:27.710> of<00:05:27.890> the<00:05:27.980> new<00:05:28.130> creatures

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
need to animate all of the new creatures

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:29.800 
need to animate all of the new creatures
and<00:05:28.790> things<00:05:28.910> like<00:05:29.030> that<00:05:29.090> that<00:05:29.240> are<00:05:29.480> going<00:05:29.600> into

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
and things like that that are going into

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.630 
and things like that that are going into
the<00:05:29.960> expansion<00:05:30.470> so<00:05:31.010> they<00:05:31.160> have<00:05:31.310> to<00:05:31.430> prioritize

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:31.640 
the expansion so they have to prioritize

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.240 
the expansion so they have to prioritize
their<00:05:32.150> time<00:05:32.360> basically<00:05:33.200> they<00:05:33.410> broke<00:05:33.890> down

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
their time basically they broke down

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.970 
their time basically they broke down
this<00:05:34.520> animation<00:05:35.060> cleanup<00:05:35.480> process<00:05:35.750> in<00:05:36.290> two

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:36.980 
this animation cleanup process in two

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.070 
this animation cleanup process in two
phases<00:05:37.340> phase<00:05:38.150> one<00:05:38.390> had<00:05:38.600> all<00:05:38.780> of<00:05:38.810> the

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
phases phase one had all of the

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.930 
phases phase one had all of the
locomotions<00:05:39.860> of<00:05:40.040> walking<00:05:40.430> running<00:05:40.610> and<00:05:40.790> that

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
locomotions of walking running and that

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.760 
locomotions of walking running and that
kind<00:05:41.150> of<00:05:41.240> thing<00:05:41.390> and<00:05:41.540> then<00:05:41.930> all<00:05:42.140> of<00:05:42.290> the<00:05:42.410> emotes

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
kind of thing and then all of the emotes

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.340 
kind of thing and then all of the emotes
and<00:05:43.070> spell<00:05:43.310> casts<00:05:43.790> phase<00:05:44.480> two<00:05:44.780> then<00:05:45.020> dealt

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:45.350 
and spell casts phase two then dealt

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:47.380 
and spell casts phase two then dealt
with<00:05:45.590> combat<00:05:45.980> animations<00:05:46.490> like<00:05:46.670> attack<00:05:47.030> stuns

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:47.390 
with combat animations like attack stuns

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.180 
with combat animations like attack stuns
and<00:05:47.600> that<00:05:47.690> kind<00:05:47.960> of<00:05:48.020> thing<00:05:48.200> and<00:05:48.350> then<00:05:48.800> finally

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
and that kind of thing and then finally

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.400 
and that kind of thing and then finally
phase<00:05:49.370> three<00:05:49.670> is<00:05:49.820> basically<00:05:50.510> a<00:05:50.630> catch-all<00:05:51.200> for

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.410 
phase three is basically a catch-all for

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.170 
phase three is basically a catch-all for
all<00:05:51.500> of<00:05:51.620> the<00:05:51.680> remaining<00:05:52.010> animations<00:05:52.700> so

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
all of the remaining animations so

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.420 
all of the remaining animations so
things<00:05:53.420> like<00:05:53.600> swimming<00:05:53.840> them<00:05:54.200> fishing<00:05:54.680> maybe

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:55.430 
things like swimming them fishing maybe

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.700 
things like swimming them fishing maybe
collecting<00:05:56.180> some<00:05:56.450> sum<00:05:56.990> or<00:05:57.170> something<00:05:57.620> like

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
collecting some sum or something like

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.530 
collecting some sum or something like
that<00:05:57.890> and<00:05:58.130> basically<00:05:58.670> regardless<00:05:59.300> of<00:05:59.420> the

00:05:59.530 --> 00:05:59.540 
that and basically regardless of the

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.750 
that and basically regardless of the
phase<00:05:59.690> and<00:05:59.990> every<00:06:00.380> animation<00:06:01.070> is<00:06:01.250> tossed<00:06:01.550> up

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:01.760 
phase and every animation is tossed up

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.610 
phase and every animation is tossed up
in<00:06:01.790> some<00:06:02.060> sort<00:06:02.270> of<00:06:02.330> form<00:06:02.540> but<00:06:02.780> the<00:06:03.140> phase<00:06:03.320> one

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 
in some sort of form but the phase one

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.410 
in some sort of form but the phase one
animations<00:06:04.160> get<00:06:04.340> the<00:06:04.430> most<00:06:04.610> loved<00:06:04.820> since<00:06:05.240> they

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:05.420 
animations get the most loved since they

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:06.880 
animations get the most loved since they
are<00:06:05.570> the<00:06:05.750> animations<00:06:06.260> that<00:06:06.350> are<00:06:06.500> seeing<00:06:06.770> the

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:06.890 
are the animations that are seeing the

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.500 
are the animations that are seeing the
most<00:06:06.920> I<00:06:07.430> think<00:06:07.880> that's<00:06:08.030> definitely<00:06:08.360> fair

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:08.510 
most I think that's definitely fair

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.920 
most I think that's definitely fair
enough<00:06:08.780> but<00:06:09.470> I'd<00:06:10.250> nearly<00:06:11.120> personally<00:06:11.660> put<00:06:11.810> as

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.930 
enough but I'd nearly personally put as

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.960 
enough but I'd nearly personally put as
much<00:06:12.140> emphasis<00:06:12.410> into<00:06:13.130> those<00:06:13.370> combat<00:06:13.820> line

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:13.970 
much emphasis into those combat line

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.280 
much emphasis into those combat line
animations<00:06:14.600> that<00:06:14.660> are<00:06:14.750> currently<00:06:15.050> in<00:06:15.140> Phase

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:15.290 
animations that are currently in Phase

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.410 
animations that are currently in Phase
two<00:06:15.350> and<00:06:15.890> but<00:06:16.490> I'm<00:06:16.580> sure<00:06:16.880> that<00:06:16.910> the<00:06:17.180> combat

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:17.420 
two and but I'm sure that the combat

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:18.820 
two and but I'm sure that the combat
animations<00:06:17.960> have<00:06:18.050> been<00:06:18.110> completely<00:06:18.590> tossed

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:18.830 
animations have been completely tossed

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.560 
animations have been completely tossed
out<00:06:19.040> because<00:06:19.190> if<00:06:19.640> they<00:06:19.940> make<00:06:20.090> three<00:06:20.300> phases

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.570 
out because if they make three phases

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.950 
out because if they make three phases
and<00:06:20.810> only<00:06:21.020> get<00:06:21.140> to<00:06:21.290> one<00:06:21.440> of<00:06:21.470> them<00:06:21.800> then<00:06:22.280> perhaps

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 
and only get to one of them then perhaps

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.870 
and only get to one of them then perhaps
they<00:06:23.960> kind<00:06:24.380> of<00:06:24.470> just<00:06:24.650> need<00:06:24.770> to<00:06:24.830> get<00:06:25.760> more

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:25.880 
they kind of just need to get more

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.730 
they kind of just need to get more
animators<00:06:26.420> but<00:06:26.780> that<00:06:26.930> shouldn't<00:06:27.230> happen<00:06:27.350> and

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:27.740 
animators but that shouldn't happen and

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:28.930 
animators but that shouldn't happen and
from<00:06:28.010> what<00:06:28.100> I've<00:06:28.250> seen<00:06:28.280> all<00:06:28.730> of<00:06:28.760> the

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:28.940 
from what I've seen all of the

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.820 
from what I've seen all of the
animations<00:06:29.450> they've<00:06:29.570> shown<00:06:29.810> off<00:06:29.990> look<00:06:30.260> great

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:31.830 
animations they've shown off look great

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.670 
animations they've shown off look great
yeah<00:06:32.729> I<00:06:32.759> think<00:06:33.270> that<00:06:33.569> overall<00:06:33.840> things<00:06:34.560> are

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 
yeah I think that overall things are

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.170 
yeah I think that overall things are
looking<00:06:34.919> pretty<00:06:35.039> solid<00:06:35.310> for<00:06:35.520> the<00:06:35.550> tour<00:06:35.759> and<00:06:35.849> as

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180 
looking pretty solid for the tour and as

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.760 
looking pretty solid for the tour and as
for<00:06:36.449> the<00:06:36.509> model<00:06:36.750> itself<00:06:37.050> I<00:06:37.349> like<00:06:37.530> it<00:06:37.650> a<00:06:37.680> lot

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:37.770 
for the model itself I like it a lot

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.050 
for the model itself I like it a lot
more<00:06:37.949> than<00:06:38.009> the<00:06:38.190> older<00:06:38.430> one<00:06:38.580> I<00:06:38.610> think<00:06:38.970> the

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.060 
more than the older one I think the

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.029 
more than the older one I think the
increase<00:06:39.360> in<00:06:39.479> fidelity<00:06:39.720> is<00:06:40.139> it's<00:06:40.889> very

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:41.039 
increase in fidelity is it's very

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:44.149 
increase in fidelity is it's very
welcomed<00:06:41.789> honestly<00:06:42.300> to<00:06:43.229> the<00:06:43.590> old<00:06:43.770> one<00:06:43.979> it

00:06:44.149 --> 00:06:44.159 
welcomed honestly to the old one it

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:45.740 
welcomed honestly to the old one it
still<00:06:44.370> feels<00:06:44.610> beefy<00:06:45.060> to<00:06:45.210> me<00:06:45.330> at<00:06:45.419> least<00:06:45.539> it

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:45.750 
still feels beefy to me at least it

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:47.689 
still feels beefy to me at least it
still<00:06:45.900> feels<00:06:46.169> like<00:06:46.319> a<00:06:46.440> Turin<00:06:46.860> and<00:06:47.129> I<00:06:47.310> love<00:06:47.550> the

00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:47.699 
still feels like a Turin and I love the

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:49.760 
still feels like a Turin and I love the
way<00:06:47.759> that<00:06:47.940> the<00:06:48.030> faces<00:06:48.509> just<00:06:49.080> have<00:06:49.199> got<00:06:49.349> so<00:06:49.620> much

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:49.770 
way that the faces just have got so much

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:52.189 
way that the faces just have got so much
more<00:06:50.120> character<00:06:51.120> to<00:06:51.389> them<00:06:51.509> plus<00:06:52.020> those

00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:52.199 
more character to them plus those

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:53.960 
more character to them plus those
wrinkles<00:06:52.620> I<00:06:52.680> think<00:06:52.860> look<00:06:53.009> a<00:06:53.129> bit<00:06:53.610> cooler<00:06:53.849> as

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:53.970 
wrinkles I think look a bit cooler as

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:57.020 
wrinkles I think look a bit cooler as
well<00:06:54.090> it's<00:06:54.780> also<00:06:54.960> nice<00:06:55.259> seeing<00:06:55.680> more<00:06:56.550> human

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.030 
well it's also nice seeing more human

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.230 
well it's also nice seeing more human
sort<00:06:57.419> of<00:06:57.509> related<00:06:57.810> emotions<00:06:58.770> like<00:06:59.340> emotion

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 
sort of related emotions like emotion

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:00.920 
sort of related emotions like emotion
