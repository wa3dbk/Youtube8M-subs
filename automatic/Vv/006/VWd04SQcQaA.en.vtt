tape to the very top is an inch and a

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.660 
tape to the very top is an inch and a
half<00:01:22.439> also<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.340> we'll<00:01:23.490> match<00:01:25.189> see<00:01:26.189> now<00:01:26.400> which<00:01:26.610> I

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
half also so we'll match see now which I

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.280 
half also so we'll match see now which I
want<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.880> cut<00:01:27.030> those<00:01:27.210> threads<00:01:27.540> off<00:01:27.750> there<00:01:28.200> in

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
want to cut those threads off there in

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.250 
want to cut those threads off there in
the<00:01:28.380> way<00:01:28.700> you<00:01:29.700> go<00:01:29.850> ahead<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.060> cut<00:01:30.270> ellipse

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:41.590 

ok<00:01:33.850> so<00:01:35.290> there's<00:01:36.290> inch<00:01:36.680> and<00:01:36.920> a<00:01:36.950> half<00:01:40.600> exactly

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
ok so there's inch and a half exactly

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.080 
ok so there's inch and a half exactly
right<00:01:41.780> there<00:01:42.110> so<00:01:42.500> if<00:01:42.620> I<00:01:42.680> can<00:01:42.830> just<00:01:42.860> hold<00:01:43.730> this

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
right there so if I can just hold this

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.540 
right there so if I can just hold this
make<00:01:44.960> sure<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.260> lining<00:01:45.680> matches<00:01:46.100> up<00:01:46.250> with<00:01:46.400> it

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
make sure the lining matches up with it

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.840 
make sure the lining matches up with it
also<00:01:47.000> a<00:01:47.330> lot<00:01:48.260> of<00:01:48.410> holding<00:01:48.830> involved<00:01:49.460> in<00:01:49.580> making

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
me measure that one more time to make

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.390 
me measure that one more time to make
sure<00:01:55.820> that's<00:01:56.090> right<00:01:56.770> yes<00:01:57.770> an<00:01:57.980> inch<00:01:58.160> and<00:01:58.340> a<00:01:58.370> half

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
sure that's right yes an inch and a half

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.060 
sure that's right yes an inch and a half
and<00:01:58.940> so<00:01:59.810> what<00:02:00.020> we<00:02:00.140> do<00:02:00.290> with<00:02:00.410> the<00:02:00.560> other<00:02:00.740> side<00:02:01.040> of

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
I'm going to do an all-over measurement

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.730 
I'm going to do an all-over measurement
to<00:02:20.450> make<00:02:20.570> sure<00:02:20.720> everything<00:02:21.110> is<00:02:21.140> matching<00:02:21.350> up

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
so this is five and a half inches from

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.930 
so this is five and a half inches from
top<00:02:24.709> to<00:02:24.770> bottom<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:26.080> this<00:02:27.080> one<00:02:27.290> is<00:02:27.800> five<00:02:28.700> and<00:02:28.910> a

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
top to bottom and this one is five and a

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.970 
top to bottom and this one is five and a
half<00:02:28.970> inches<00:02:29.300> from<00:02:29.630> top<00:02:29.840> to<00:02:29.900> bottom<00:02:30.050> so<00:02:30.560> now<00:02:30.950> I

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
half inches from top to bottom so now I

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.240 
half inches from top to bottom so now I
know<00:02:31.180> that<00:02:32.180> it's<00:02:32.560> perfectly<00:02:33.560> straight<00:02:34.070> and

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
know that it's perfectly straight and

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.610 
know that it's perfectly straight and
now<00:02:34.700> i'm<00:02:35.090> going<00:02:35.420> to<00:02:35.510> go<00:02:35.660> ahead<00:02:35.690> and<00:02:36.050> sew<00:02:36.380> the

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
now i'm going to go ahead and sew the

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.489 
now i'm going to go ahead and sew the
sides<00:02:36.830> closed
