mind for my strength work I am using the

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.139 
mind for my strength work I am using the
pod<00:02:06.960> 3:1<00:02:07.500> routine<00:02:07.829> because<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:08.640> is<00:02:08.759> designed

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
pod 3:1 routine because it is designed

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.180

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
to get you a lot stronger and the

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.920 
to get you a lot stronger and the
vertical<00:02:11.610> jump

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
vertical jump

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.539 
vertical jump
movement<00:02:12.409> has<00:02:12.590> a<00:02:12.620> lot<00:02:12.890> to<00:02:12.920> do<00:02:13.129> with<00:02:13.250> strength

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:13.549 
movement has a lot to do with strength

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:16.420 
movement has a lot to do with strength
if<00:02:13.909> you<00:02:14.269> gain<00:02:14.510> a<00:02:14.540> lot<00:02:14.870> of<00:02:15.019> strength<00:02:15.409> and<00:02:15.739> you<00:02:16.250> do

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
it with a lot of speed then you will not

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.319 
it with a lot of speed then you will not
decrease<00:02:18.920> your<00:02:19.250> vertical<00:02:19.670> jump<00:02:19.700> because<00:02:20.180> a

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:20.329 
decrease your vertical jump because a

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:21.670 
decrease your vertical jump because a

players think how big they are most of

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.179 
players think how big they are most of
them<00:02:29.299> away<00:02:29.389> well<00:02:29.750> over<00:02:30.079> 200<00:02:30.469> pounds<00:02:30.620> and<00:02:30.980> have

them away well over 200 pounds and have

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:33.309 
them away well over 200 pounds and have
a<00:02:31.219> high<00:02:31.459> vertical<00:02:31.700> jump<00:02:32.209> so<00:02:32.780> if<00:02:32.930> you<00:02:33.079> want<00:02:33.260> to

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
a high vertical jump so if you want to

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.050 
a high vertical jump so if you want to
jump<00:02:33.590> high<00:02:33.769> you<00:02:33.980> have<00:02:34.040> to<00:02:34.250> be<00:02:34.370> fast<00:02:34.670> you<00:02:34.939> have

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
jump high you have to be fast you have

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.129 
jump high you have to be fast you have
to<00:02:35.150> be<00:02:35.239> strong<00:02:35.540> and<00:02:35.750> you<00:02:35.840> have<00:02:35.930> to<00:02:36.019> be

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:36.139 
to be strong and you have to be

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:37.229 
to be strong and you have to be
explosive

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
explosive

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.479 
explosive
so<00:02:38.239> the<00:02:38.599> squats<00:02:38.930> are<00:02:39.170> crucial<00:02:39.799> for<00:02:39.950> getting

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
so the squats are crucial for getting

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:41.080 
so the squats are crucial for getting
strong

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
strong

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.209

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:43.219 
every time you squat make sure you do

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:46.119 
every time you squat make sure you do
low<00:02:43.730> reps<00:02:44.030> low<00:02:44.569> sets<00:02:44.930> and<00:02:45.200> go<00:02:45.470> as<00:02:45.680> low<00:02:45.950> as<00:02:45.980> you

low reps low sets and go as low as you

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:48.909 
low reps low sets and go as low as you
possibly<00:02:46.220> can<00:02:46.819> and<00:02:46.879> be<00:02:47.239> very<00:02:47.480> explosive<00:02:47.919> now

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:48.919 
possibly can and be very explosive now

it comes to vertical jump training I'm
not<00:02:55.099> sure<00:02:55.280> that<00:02:55.310> I<00:02:55.519> add<00:02:55.700> a<00:02:55.730> bunch<00:02:56.030> of<00:02:56.180> barbell

this<00:02:58.639> workout<00:02:59.060> because<00:02:59.870> I<00:02:59.900> don't<00:03:00.319> only<00:03:00.500> want

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
this workout because I don't only want

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.699 
this workout because I don't only want
to<00:03:00.859> focus<00:03:00.980> on<00:03:01.250> squats<00:03:01.870> my<00:03:02.870> main<00:03:03.109> goal<00:03:03.379> is<00:03:03.409> to

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
to focus on squats my main goal is to

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.589 
to focus on squats my main goal is to
jump<00:03:03.980> higher<00:03:04.219> so<00:03:04.730> that's<00:03:04.969> why<00:03:05.120> I<00:03:05.150> focus<00:03:05.569> on

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
jump higher so that's why I focus on

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.690 
jump higher so that's why I focus on
jumping<00:03:06.079> first<00:03:06.290> and<00:03:06.620> then<00:03:07.189> I<00:03:07.340> build<00:03:07.579> my

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
jumping first and then I build my

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.940 
jumping first and then I build my
workout<00:03:08.120> around<00:03:08.450> jumping<00:03:08.930> a<00:03:09.079> lot<00:03:09.590> of<00:03:09.709> people

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
workout around jumping a lot of people

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.589 
workout around jumping a lot of people
make<00:03:10.129> the<00:03:10.280> mistake<00:03:10.310> of<00:03:10.639> only<00:03:11.150> working<00:03:11.450> out

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
make the mistake of only working out

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.119 
make the mistake of only working out
their<00:03:11.780> legs<00:03:12.019> and<00:03:12.200> getting<00:03:12.349> stronger<00:03:12.650> and<00:03:13.040> they

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:13.129 
their legs and getting stronger and they

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:15.069 
their legs and getting stronger and they
forget<00:03:13.430> to<00:03:13.489> jump<00:03:13.849> high<00:03:14.000> if<00:03:14.299> you<00:03:14.719> forget<00:03:15.019> to

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
forget to jump high if you forget to

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:16.719 
forget to jump high if you forget to
jump<00:03:15.500> high<00:03:15.650> then<00:03:16.129> you're<00:03:16.280> just<00:03:16.400> gonna<00:03:16.579> get

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:16.729 
jump high then you're just gonna get

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:18.280 
jump high then you're just gonna get
stronger<00:03:17.000> and<00:03:17.269> your<00:03:17.359> vertical<00:03:17.750> jump<00:03:17.780> will<00:03:18.139> not

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
stronger and your vertical jump will not

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.050 
stronger and your vertical jump will not
increase<00:03:18.590> much<00:03:18.650> you<00:03:19.280> have<00:03:19.400> to<00:03:19.519> remember<00:03:19.790> that

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
increase much you have to remember that

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.610 
increase much you have to remember that
you<00:03:20.209> must<00:03:20.359> practice<00:03:20.629> jumping<00:03:21.229> if<00:03:21.379> you're<00:03:21.560> a

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
you must practice jumping if you're a

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.500 
you must practice jumping if you're a
jumper<00:03:22.040> if<00:03:22.310> you're<00:03:22.609> a<00:03:22.639> lifter<00:03:23.090> you<00:03:23.299> lift

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
jumper if you're a lifter you lift

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.599 
jumper if you're a lifter you lift
weights<00:03:23.690> however<00:03:24.620> you<00:03:24.919> can<00:03:25.099> still<00:03:25.370> lift
