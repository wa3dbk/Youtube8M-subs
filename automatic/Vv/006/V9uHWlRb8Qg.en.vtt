don't care I don't gyro blades we don't
get<00:01:04.949> along<00:01:05.159> very<00:01:05.220> well<00:01:05.610> but<00:01:06.060> they<00:01:06.450> can<00:01:06.720> be<00:01:06.750> your

we<00:01:10.080> just<00:01:10.409> have<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.740> fight<00:01:11.130> here<00:01:13.040> it's<00:01:14.040> different

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
we just have a fight here it's different

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.980 
we just have a fight here it's different
this<00:01:14.549> time<00:01:14.610> though<00:01:15.060> because<00:01:15.270> now<00:01:15.570> we<00:01:15.630> have

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
this time though because now we have

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.960 
this time though because now we have
access<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.770> gyro<00:01:17.040> blade<00:01:17.430> in<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.729> middle

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
access to the gyro blade in the middle

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.890 
access to the gyro blade in the middle
of<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.090> room

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.800 

when<00:01:21.530> activated<00:01:22.250> and<00:01:22.460> in<00:01:22.880> motion<00:01:23.300> the<00:01:23.540> gyro

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
when activated and in motion the gyro

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.980 
when activated and in motion the gyro
blade<00:01:24.140> does<00:01:24.970> massive<00:01:25.970> damage<00:01:26.270> to<00:01:26.660> anything

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
blade does massive damage to anything

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.300 
blade does massive damage to anything
that<00:01:27.260> it<00:01:27.500> touches<00:01:29.380> which<00:01:30.380> is<00:01:30.500> a<00:01:30.530> great<00:01:30.950> way<00:01:31.250> to

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
that it touches which is a great way to

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.250 
that it touches which is a great way to
clear<00:01:31.640> out<00:01:31.790> a<00:01:31.820> room<00:01:32.120> I<00:01:32.420> don't<00:01:33.050> really<00:01:33.140> have

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
clear out a room I don't really have

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.700 
clear out a room I don't really have
extensive<00:01:34.190> practice<00:01:35.090> using<00:01:35.810> the<00:01:35.990> gyro<00:01:36.380> blade

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
extensive practice using the gyro blade

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.030 
extensive practice using the gyro blade
combat<00:01:37.670> I<00:01:37.880> think<00:01:38.180> it's<00:01:38.270> too<00:01:38.390> much<00:01:38.420> of<00:01:38.570> a<00:01:38.720> hassle

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
combat I think it's too much of a hassle

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.020 
combat I think it's too much of a hassle
but<00:01:40.040> for<00:01:40.280> the<00:01:40.340> point<00:01:40.520> of<00:01:40.580> this<00:01:40.670> video<00:01:40.850> I

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
but for the point of this video I

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.710 
but for the point of this video I
figured<00:01:41.510> I'd<00:01:41.600> show<00:01:41.840> it<00:01:41.870> off<00:01:42.110> a<00:01:42.140> little<00:01:42.320> bit

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
figured I'd show it off a little bit

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.820 
figured I'd show it off a little bit
gets<00:01:44.720> me<00:01:44.870> into<00:01:44.990> more<00:01:45.200> trouble<00:01:45.230> than<00:01:45.680> it's

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
gets me into more trouble than it's

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.970 
gets me into more trouble than it's
worth<00:01:46.630> especially<00:01:47.630> on<00:01:47.660> a<00:01:47.810> harder<00:01:48.530> difficulty

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:48.980 
worth especially on a harder difficulty

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.870 
worth especially on a harder difficulty
when<00:01:49.640> you<00:01:50.480> have<00:01:50.600> to<00:01:50.780> yeah<00:01:51.290> exactly<00:01:52.010> when<00:01:52.790> you

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
when you have to yeah exactly when you

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.130 
when you have to yeah exactly when you
have<00:01:52.970> to<00:01:53.090> split<00:01:53.360> your<00:01:53.510> attention<00:01:55.990> you<00:01:56.990> should

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
have to split your attention you should

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.620 
have to split your attention you should
always<00:01:57.290> keep<00:01:57.590> your<00:01:57.770> eye<00:01:57.800> on<00:01:57.920> the<00:01:58.190> enemy<00:01:58.640> forget

when the Blitz is almost dead after a

when the Blitz is almost dead after a
sound<00:02:38.379> beating<00:02:38.799> it<00:02:39.610> goes<00:02:39.849> into<00:02:40.030> a<00:02:40.120> sort<00:02:40.420> of

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
sound beating it goes into a sort of

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.690 
sound beating it goes into a sort of
super<00:02:40.959> mode<00:02:41.140> and<00:02:41.440> this<00:02:41.590> is<00:02:41.890> highlighted<00:02:42.670> by

the<00:02:42.819> fact<00:02:43.090> that<00:02:43.209> it<00:02:43.390> turns<00:02:43.599> red<00:02:45.030> its<00:02:46.030> attacks

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
the fact that it turns red its attacks

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.880 
the fact that it turns red its attacks
are<00:02:46.870> quicker<00:02:47.799> stronger<00:02:48.700> and<00:02:49.290> he<00:02:50.290> still<00:02:50.650> has<00:02:50.860> a

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
little lightning thing going on so you

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.680 
little lightning thing going on so you
can't<00:02:53.349> hit<00:02:53.470> him<00:02:53.530> with<00:02:53.680> your<00:02:53.799> sword<00:02:54.690> always

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
can't hit him with your sword always

can't hit him with your sword always
keep<00:02:55.989> moving<00:02:56.440> see<00:02:56.709> I<00:02:56.739> got<00:02:56.980> caught<00:02:57.190> on<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:57.340> edge

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
keep moving see I got caught on the edge

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.559 
keep moving see I got caught on the edge
of<00:02:57.700> that<00:02:57.879> and<00:02:58.150> it<00:02:58.420> still<00:02:58.660> did<00:02:58.870> so<00:02:59.170> much<00:02:59.349> damage

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
of that and it still did so much damage

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.819 
of that and it still did so much damage
what<00:03:01.569> did<00:03:01.660> I<00:03:01.720> say<00:03:01.930> about<00:03:01.959> not<00:03:02.349> hitting<00:03:02.500> it<00:03:02.739> with

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
what did I say about not hitting it with

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:06.390

although it's not really all that
complicated<00:04:31.210> there<00:04:32.210> are<00:04:32.420> four<00:04:33.020> spots<00:04:33.410> for

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
complicated there are four spots for

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.110 
complicated there are four spots for
gyro<00:04:33.919> blades<00:04:34.130> in<00:04:34.490> the<00:04:34.580> center<00:04:34.910> of<00:04:34.940> this

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
gyro blades in the center of this

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.170 
gyro blades in the center of this
hallway<00:04:35.419> and<00:04:35.960> we<00:04:36.740> need<00:04:36.950> to<00:04:37.190> put<00:04:37.639> two<00:04:37.850> of<00:04:37.880> them

hallway and we need to put two of them

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.100 
hallway and we need to put two of them
in<00:04:38.270> place<00:04:38.570> we'll<00:04:39.260> get<00:04:39.410> to<00:04:39.560> that<00:04:39.590> but<00:04:40.070> for<00:04:40.520> now

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
in place we'll get to that but for now

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:46.020 
in place we'll get to that but for now
more<00:04:42.110> furniture<00:04:42.410> to<00:04:42.800> destroy<00:04:43.220> and<00:04:44.050> possibly

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
more furniture to destroy and possibly
