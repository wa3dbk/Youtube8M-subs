00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:08.880
 Hello, I'm Reginaldo Ferreira. 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.250
 nautical 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.580
 today we will record a tip talking to 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.920
 respect of transport safety 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:20.970
 This is a security that I have 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.980
 small accident and thanks to a mechanism 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.949
 What is there for you today? 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.220
 prevent a much greater accident 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.529
 I do not go, something much more happened. 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.340
 The agent I'm going to tell you is dangerous. 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:38.070
 so what happens for you to have 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.230
 transport more safely one of the 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.899
 details you have to watch out for is 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.289
 very important is that the weight of your 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.870
 he is ahead 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.719
 concentrate more here in front but not 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.360
 so strong that you can not even 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.239
 lifting is a weight that you have 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.680
 conditions to make the coupling a bit 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.750
 not right 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.140
 but if you drop the boat not in 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.590
 pine he is front then you 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.180
 always arrange battery installation 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.340
 as you set the engine when the tank 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.710
 is full you will not leave the 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.680
 back boat that is very 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.470
 dangerous in the event of an accident that 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.310
 tell from here what happened 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:26.070
 with me another very important detail 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:30.390
 This is where this trail is when you 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.200
 lower it on the coupling the header of your 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.140
 cart 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.850
 I always put that pile one more 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.860
 security detail that was what made me 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.360
 saved 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:45.049
 this current placed in the holder of your 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.149
 carriage through a screw 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:50.460
 I was coming back from a fishery with 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.040
 a friend of mine we always fish together 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.259
 and as much as we're careful we 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.049
 We passed a hole and my cart 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.270
 she disconnected yet this care 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.700
 that we are now showing with the 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.000
 pupil all the same so there was a twist 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.140
 the vehicle and she disconnected what 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.979
 It happened 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.500
 The boat makes a very 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.260
 dangerous if it did not have this 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.420
 there are people attached to a screw of themselves with 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.250
 We sure would have 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.790
 tragedy because we 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.620
 this happened precisely to the 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.320
 cross a cart 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.060
 So what were the details that I 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.010
 I know that you helped me a lot in this 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.959
 moment the boat is ahead because 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.020
 He did not lift the front he came to 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.780
 under the car did not spoil the lid 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.140
 rear at that time was not that 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.330
 vehicle was a double cabin pickup truck 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.720
 and current supported 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.180
 You just have to watch out because the 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.280
 which held very tight was a screw 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.380
 sometimes we even wear padlocks there 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.270
 but I know from reports that the padlock 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.180
 ended up bursting 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.310
 so the best is the best shape that I 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.980
 I advise you to put a screw well 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.190
 thick stainless steel screw with two 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.890
 two doors locking you in 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.320
 time of an emergency you need 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.270
 Quotes that came to escape you need 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.519
 stop the vehicle too so there is a 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.299
 very strong force she gets all this 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.850
 chain 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:24.780
 this is a very 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:29.130
 important thing is then my tip of 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.940
 selton header or current stack with the 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.160
 screw 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.410
 This is the best method there for sure. 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.430
 you have a great chance to avoid 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.200
 accidents 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.690
 and if any accident happens 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.209
 that it is well minimized 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:45.269
 Thank you very much, once again I hope that 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.790
 have enjoyed this tip and as always 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.329
 As I always say so, my channel on 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.790
