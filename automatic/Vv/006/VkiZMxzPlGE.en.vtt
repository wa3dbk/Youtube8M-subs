00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
combining strumming and picking that's

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.399 
combining strumming and picking that's
the<00:01:01.630> last<00:01:01.810> one<00:01:02.020> I<00:01:02.080> did

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.410

so it's dropping with the people
together<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.990> that's<00:01:07.380> really<00:01:07.650> when<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:08.010> can

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
together and that's really when you can

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.110 
together and that's really when you can
start<00:01:08.790> getting<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.270> much<00:01:09.420> interesting<00:01:10.110> sounds

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
picking pattern are going to have is

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.040 
picking pattern are going to have is
well<00:01:46.800> first<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.520> all<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:48.149> direction<00:01:48.330> picks<00:01:48.960> is

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
well first of all the direction picks is

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.719 
well first of all the direction picks is
going<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.259> be<00:01:49.350> in<00:01:49.410> is<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.890> same<00:01:50.070> as<00:01:50.310> strumming

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.340 

that's<00:01:56.940> the<00:01:57.180> same<00:01:57.360> direction<00:01:57.690> your<00:01:58.140> pics

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
that's the same direction your pics

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.249 
that's the same direction your pics
going<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.619> move<00:01:59.060> so<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.149> first<00:02:00.390> two<00:02:00.600> dams<00:02:00.899> are

going to move so the first two dams are
going<00:02:01.470> to<00:02:01.530> be<00:02:01.680> on<00:02:02.119> just<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.360> string<00:02:04.280> then<00:02:05.280> we

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
going to be on just a string then we

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.229 
going to be on just a string then we
only<00:02:05.520> go<00:02:05.729> back<00:02:05.910> up<00:02:06.800> on<00:02:07.800> the<00:02:08.100> thinny<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.729> then

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
only go back up on the thinny and then

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.350 
only go back up on the thinny and then
up<00:02:09.690> on<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:09.959> B

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
up on the B

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.080 

just<00:02:26.390> like<00:02:26.540> that

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.110 

that's<00:02:30.360> a<00:02:30.420> bit<00:02:30.570> of<00:02:30.690> a<00:02:30.750> quick<00:02:31.140> down<00:02:31.500> up<00:02:31.950> there<00:02:32.670> up

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
that's a bit of a quick down up there up

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.540 
that's a bit of a quick down up there up
there<00:02:33.450> between<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:34.710> thin<00:02:34.920> edge<00:02:35.070> screen<00:02:35.310> so

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
there between the thin edge screen so

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.060 
there between the thin edge screen so
just<00:02:35.580> practices<00:02:36.180> while<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.720> get<00:02:36.900> it<00:02:37.070> standing

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
just practices while to get it standing

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.830 
just practices while to get it standing
nice<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.460> neat<00:02:38.610> so

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.320 

now<00:02:42.319> the<00:02:42.380> next<00:02:42.709> chord<00:02:42.890> is<00:02:43.190> a<00:02:43.520> minor<00:02:43.550> and<00:02:44.060> the

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
now the next chord is a minor and the

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.630 
now the next chord is a minor and the
right<00:02:44.540> hand<00:02:44.810> patterns<00:02:45.230> exactly<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:45.709> same

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.760 

so<00:02:51.210> that's<00:02:51.420> not<00:02:51.600> amazing<00:02:51.870> then<00:02:52.350> when<00:02:52.530> we<00:02:52.590> go<00:02:52.710> to

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
so that's not amazing then when we go to

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.040 
so that's not amazing then when we go to
our<00:02:52.830> C<00:02:53.160> chord<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:54.120> only<00:02:54.330> thing<00:02:54.480> that<00:02:54.600> changes

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
our C chord the only thing that changes

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.080 
our C chord the only thing that changes
is<00:02:55.110> you<00:02:55.320> were<00:02:55.410> playing<00:02:55.740> a<00:02:56.040> string<00:02:56.640> number<00:02:56.730> five

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
is you were playing a string number five

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:03.699 
is you were playing a string number five
as<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.660> first<00:02:57.900> two<00:02:58.140> down<00:02:58.350> so

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:09.260 

did<00:03:04.220> it<00:03:04.340> again

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.210 

and<00:03:09.360> then<00:03:09.990> a<00:03:10.170> last<00:03:10.320> quote<00:03:10.590> is<00:03:10.710> date<00:03:10.950> and

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
and then a last quote is date and

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.430 
and then a last quote is date and
replying<00:03:12.210> the<00:03:12.420> date<00:03:12.630> string<00:03:12.930> as<00:03:13.140> a<00:03:13.170> first

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
replying the date string as a first

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.620 
replying the date string as a first
night

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.640 

do

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.630 

because<00:03:24.650> we<00:03:24.739> jump<00:03:24.950> around<00:03:25.069> the<00:03:25.220> strings<00:03:25.459> be

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
because we jump around the strings be

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.670 
because we jump around the strings be
more<00:03:25.879> like<00:03:26.150> I<00:03:26.269> said<00:03:26.510> it's<00:03:26.690> it's<00:03:27.019> pretty<00:03:27.260> cool

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
more like I said it's it's pretty cool

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.020 
more like I said it's it's pretty cool
if<00:03:27.800> you<00:03:27.830> just<00:03:28.099> watch<00:03:28.280> your<00:03:28.459> hand

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.990 
much you probably have to find you're
looking<00:03:33.680> between<00:03:33.800> hands<00:03:34.250> to<00:03:34.459> get<00:03:34.550> the<00:03:34.670> chords

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
looking between hands to get the chords

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.150 
looking between hands to get the chords
looking<00:03:35.300> good<00:03:35.450> and<00:03:35.660> then<00:03:36.170> going<00:03:36.709> back<00:03:36.830> to<00:03:36.860> Lord

let's<00:03:47.629> go<00:03:47.750> through<00:03:47.989> and<00:03:48.260> play<00:03:48.410> this<00:03:48.709> picking

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
let's go through and play this picking

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.780 
let's go through and play this picking
pattern<00:03:49.900> playing<00:03:50.900> the<00:03:51.739> four<00:03:52.129> chords<00:03:52.580> and

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
pattern playing the four chords and

we're<00:03:52.970> going<00:03:53.090> to<00:03:53.150> do<00:03:53.330> one<00:03:53.690> bar<00:03:53.900> of<00:03:53.930> each<00:03:54.230> chord

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
we're going to do one bar of each chord

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.479 
we're going to do one bar of each chord
and<00:03:54.980> I'm<00:03:55.370> gonna<00:03:55.489> get<00:03:55.730> breaks<00:03:55.940> in<00:03:56.120> between<00:03:57.489> so

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
and I'm gonna get breaks in between so

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:05.200 
and I'm gonna get breaks in between so
here<00:03:58.790> you<00:03:58.849> go<00:03:58.940> one<00:03:59.420> two<00:04:00.019> three<00:04:00.459> four

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:05.210 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:10.550 

actually<00:04:05.780> one

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:17.240 

as<00:04:10.920> your<00:04:11.160> City<00:04:11.459> PD<00:04:11.760> I<00:04:11.790> string<00:04:12.240> damn<00:04:15.530> -<00:04:16.530> your<00:04:16.739> D<00:04:16.950> I

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
as your City PD I string damn - your D I

as your City PD I string damn - your D I
pick<00:04:17.609> the<00:04:17.730> D<00:04:17.880> string

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.279 

so<00:04:23.030> like<00:04:23.180> I<00:04:23.270> said<00:04:23.330> practice<00:04:23.840> that<00:04:23.960> nice<00:04:24.139> and

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:24.289 
so like I said practice that nice and

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:26.449 
slow and get really familiar with how it

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:26.860 
slow and get really familiar with how it
feels

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
feels

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.170 
feels
I'm<00:04:27.560> gonna<00:04:27.770> do<00:04:27.889> it<00:04:27.979> again<00:04:28.220> I'm<00:04:28.699> not<00:04:28.940> going<00:04:29.120> to

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
I'm gonna do it again I'm not going to

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.300 
I'm gonna do it again I'm not going to
stop<00:04:29.360> between<00:04:29.509> the<00:04:29.780> chords<00:04:30.110> you<00:04:30.380> have<00:04:30.979> trouble

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
stop between the chords you have trouble

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.610 
stop between the chords you have trouble
this<00:04:31.460> play<00:04:31.970> played<00:04:32.330> a<00:04:32.360> lot<00:04:32.539> of<00:04:32.660> breaks<00:04:32.900> here<00:04:33.530> we

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
this play played a lot of breaks here we

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:59.090 
this play played a lot of breaks here we
go<00:04:33.740> 1<00:04:34.400> 2<00:04:34.970> 3<00:04:35.000> 4

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.240 

they<00:05:00.100> have<00:05:00.340> this<00:05:00.640> out<00:05:00.910> picking<00:05:01.860> those<00:05:02.860> cold

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
they have this out picking those cold

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.550 
they have this out picking those cold
patterns<00:05:03.700> and<00:05:03.970> that<00:05:04.240> adds<00:05:04.480> a<00:05:04.810> lot<00:05:04.960> of<00:05:05.080> variety

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
patterns and that adds a lot of variety

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.350 
patterns and that adds a lot of variety
to<00:05:05.710> display<00:05:06.070> miles<00:05:06.310> from<00:05:06.580> the<00:05:06.730> whole<00:05:06.940> song

so<00:05:25.910> it<00:05:26.030> had<00:05:26.210> even<00:05:26.510> more<00:05:26.690> variety<00:05:27.170> we're<00:05:27.500> going

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
so it had even more variety we're going

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.380 
so it had even more variety we're going
to<00:05:27.680> run<00:05:27.800> through<00:05:28.010> another<00:05:28.130> exercise<00:05:28.790> now<00:05:29.060> and

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:29.390 
to run through another exercise now and

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.090 
to run through another exercise now and
I<00:05:29.720> think<00:05:29.960> my<00:05:30.110> clients<00:05:30.530> find<00:05:30.620> that<00:05:30.860> a<00:05:30.920> little

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100 
I think my clients find that a little

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.250 
I think my clients find that a little
bit<00:05:31.220> easier<00:05:31.630> we're<00:05:32.630> just<00:05:32.780> going<00:05:32.930> to<00:05:32.990> replace

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
bit easier we're just going to replace

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.070 
bit easier we're just going to replace
the<00:05:33.500> first<00:05:33.710> two<00:05:34.010> downs<00:05:34.310> with<00:05:34.700> Strong's<00:05:35.120> and

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
the first two downs with Strong's and

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.510 
the first two downs with Strong's and
the<00:05:36.260> up<00:05:36.470> up<00:05:36.950> down<00:05:37.280> stills<00:05:38.030> the<00:05:38.180> pics<00:05:39.430> so<00:05:40.430> you

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
the up up down stills the pics so you

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.010 
the up up down stills the pics so you
don't<00:05:40.760> have<00:05:40.880> to<00:05:40.970> worry<00:05:41.150> about<00:05:41.270> the<00:05:41.540> base<00:05:41.720> night

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
don't have to worry about the base night

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.690 
don't have to worry about the base night
you<00:05:42.320> hit<00:05:42.620> you're<00:05:42.920> going<00:05:43.040> to<00:05:43.100> be<00:05:43.160> snug<00:05:43.370> on<00:05:43.580> all

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:43.700 
you hit you're going to be snug on all

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.020 
you hit you're going to be snug on all
the<00:05:43.820> strings<00:05:44.920> so<00:05:45.920> it's<00:05:46.490> going<00:05:46.730> to<00:05:46.790> sound<00:05:46.910> like

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
the strings so it's going to sound like

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:52.410 
the strings so it's going to sound like
this

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:52.420 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.540 

they're<00:05:53.020> the<00:05:53.140> last<00:05:53.260> basis<00:05:53.740> I'm<00:05:53.920> picking<00:05:54.400> for

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
they're the last basis I'm picking for

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:55.680 
they're the last basis I'm picking for
the<00:05:54.730> first<00:05:54.940> to<00:05:55.210> dance

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.690 
the first to dance

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:02.879 
the first to dance
a<00:05:55.840> strong<00:05:56.530> fight<00:05:57.220> again

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:02.889 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:05.790 

so<00:06:03.520> because<00:06:03.879> the<00:06:04.479> bass<00:06:04.659> note<00:06:05.020> isn't<00:06:05.500> being

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
so because the bass note isn't being

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.230 
so because the bass note isn't being
picking<00:06:06.219> up<00:06:06.340> the<00:06:06.490> word<00:06:06.639> battery<00:06:07.000> string

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 
picking up the word battery string

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.749 
picking up the word battery string
applying<00:06:07.919> let<00:06:08.919> me<00:06:09.009> run<00:06:09.159> through<00:06:09.310> that<00:06:09.520> version

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:09.759 
applying let me run through that version

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:11.730 
applying let me run through that version
then<00:06:10.060> it<00:06:10.180> breaks<00:06:10.449> between<00:06:10.719> the<00:06:11.020> chords<00:06:11.349> here

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:11.740 
then it breaks between the chords here

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:17.950 
then it breaks between the chords here
we<00:06:11.830> go<00:06:11.979> one<00:06:12.639> two<00:06:13.300> three<00:06:14.020> four

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:23.260 

my<00:06:18.910> strong<00:06:19.910> strong

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.270 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:32.800 

see<00:06:23.900> strong<00:06:24.860> strung<00:06:25.639> up<00:06:26.080> there<00:06:27.310> indeed<00:06:28.419> sir

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:32.810 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.380 

summer<00:06:33.440> after<00:06:33.680> that<00:06:34.040> again<00:06:34.340> that<00:06:35.000> version

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:35.390 
summer after that again that version

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:36.970 
summer after that again that version
just<00:06:35.540> did<00:06:35.750> a<00:06:35.930> little<00:06:36.110> bit<00:06:36.320> quick<00:06:36.500> up<00:06:36.650> with<00:06:36.830> not

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:36.980 
just did a little bit quick up with not

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.500 
just did a little bit quick up with not
Brice<00:06:37.250> if<00:06:37.610> you<00:06:37.700> have<00:06:37.820> trouble<00:06:38.180> play<00:06:38.360> the

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:38.510 
Brice if you have trouble play the

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:40.900 
Brice if you have trouble play the
version<00:06:38.810> we<00:06:38.870> just<00:06:39.020> play<00:06:39.200> here<00:06:39.770> we<00:06:39.860> go<00:06:39.950> one<00:06:40.490> two

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:40.910 
version we just play here we go one two

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:54.580 
version we just play here we go one two
three<00:06:41.660> four

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:54.590 

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.080 

so<00:06:55.590> there<00:06:55.800> I<00:06:55.830> combined<00:06:56.250> strumming<00:06:56.760> with

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:57.090 
so there I combined strumming with

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.800 
so there I combined strumming with
picking<00:06:57.510> to<00:06:57.630> add<00:06:57.780> even<00:06:58.080> more<00:06:58.290> interest<00:06:59.810> when

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:00.810 
picking to add even more interest when

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:03.050 
picking to add even more interest when
you<00:07:00.900> get<00:07:01.050> good<00:07:01.230> at<00:07:01.350> this<00:07:01.650> technique<00:07:02.220> get<00:07:02.940> at

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:03.060 
you get good at this technique get at

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.490 
you get good at this technique get at
the<00:07:03.210> end<00:07:03.450> look<00:07:03.570> on<00:07:03.720> the<00:07:03.840> internet<00:07:04.200> and<00:07:04.410> all<00:07:04.470> the

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:04.500 
the end look on the internet and all the

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.380 
the end look on the internet and all the
different<00:07:04.770> songs<00:07:05.160> out<00:07:05.370> there<00:07:05.400> and<00:07:05.850> then

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:06.390 
different songs out there and then

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:07.910 
different songs out there and then
invite<00:07:06.720> catwalks<00:07:07.230> and<00:07:07.410> all<00:07:07.470> that<00:07:07.620> sort<00:07:07.860> of

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:07.920 
invite catwalks and all that sort of

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.440 
invite catwalks and all that sort of
stuff<00:07:07.980> and<00:07:08.160> have<00:07:08.490> a<00:07:08.520> listen<00:07:08.760> heaps<00:07:09.090> of<00:07:09.210> players

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:09.450 
stuff and have a listen heaps of players

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:11.330 
stuff and have a listen heaps of players
because<00:07:10.110> you'll<00:07:10.260> often<00:07:10.410> find<00:07:10.560> players<00:07:11.100> when

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:11.340 
because you'll often find players when

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.210 
because you'll often find players when
we<00:07:11.430> combine<00:07:11.790> these<00:07:12.030> two<00:07:12.240> techniques<00:07:13.220> almost

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:14.220 
we combine these two techniques almost

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:17.870 
we combine these two techniques almost
sort<00:07:14.940> of<00:07:14.970> like<00:07:15.030> together<00:07:16.670> when<00:07:17.670> they're

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:17.880 
sort of like together when they're

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.640 
sort of like together when they're
struggling<00:07:18.480> they'll<00:07:18.720> be<00:07:18.810> picking<00:07:19.050> so<00:07:19.380> as

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:19.650 
struggling they'll be picking so as

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:21.920 
struggling they'll be picking so as
they're<00:07:19.890> strumming<00:07:20.280> so<00:07:20.550> I'll<00:07:21.480> give<00:07:21.690> you<00:07:21.780> a<00:07:21.810> bit

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:21.930 
they're strumming so I'll give you a bit

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:23.510 
they're strumming so I'll give you a bit
of<00:07:21.960> an<00:07:22.110> example<00:07:22.410> with<00:07:22.650> those<00:07:22.800> same<00:07:23.010> chords<00:07:23.280> or

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:23.520 
of an example with those same chords or

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:42.850 
of an example with those same chords or
something<00:07:23.880> I<00:07:24.090> might<00:07:24.300> do<00:07:24.860> two<00:07:25.940> four

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:42.860 

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:44.900 

so<00:07:43.860> obviously<00:07:44.100> you<00:07:44.250> can<00:07:44.370> get<00:07:44.520> a<00:07:44.550> lot<00:07:44.760> more

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:44.910 
so obviously you can get a lot more

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:46.880 
so obviously you can get a lot more
interesting<00:07:45.360> and<00:07:45.540> intricate<00:07:45.900> but<00:07:46.530> right<00:07:46.710> now

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:46.890 
interesting and intricate but right now

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:49.880 
interesting and intricate but right now
just<00:07:47.160> practice<00:07:47.370> those<00:07:47.760> basic<00:07:48.120> examples<00:07:48.890> play

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:49.890 
just practice those basic examples play

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:51.860 
just practice those basic examples play
life's<00:07:50.130> hoping<00:07:50.460> it<00:07:50.550> fun<00:07:50.820> adding<00:07:51.120> some<00:07:51.420> variety
