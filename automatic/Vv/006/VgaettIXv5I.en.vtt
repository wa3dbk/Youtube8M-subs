never really bothered repairing it and

never really bothered repairing it and
problem<00:00:39.120> seems<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.480> be<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:39.750> red<00:00:40.260> flaring<00:00:41.010> it

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
problem seems to be this red flaring it

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.220 
problem seems to be this red flaring it
always<00:00:41.730> tries<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.000> flare<00:00:42.360> off<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.750> one<00:00:42.899> side

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.430 
always tries to flare off to one side
and<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:43.620> get<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.739> ripley<00:00:44.960> strip<00:00:45.960> which<00:00:46.140> might

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
and you get a ripley strip which might

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.950 
and you get a ripley strip which might
not<00:00:46.620> even<00:00:46.770> show<00:00:46.890> up<00:00:47.280> but<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.670> can<00:00:48.450> sort<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.750> see

not even show up but you can sort of see

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.350 
not even show up but you can sort of see
it<00:00:49.100> it's<00:00:50.100> just<00:00:50.250> rippling<00:00:50.700> up<00:00:50.940> through<00:00:51.210> the

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
it it's just rippling up through the

it it's just rippling up through the

the red red to yellow spectrum but if I
go<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.409> say<00:01:17.130> on<00:01:17.700> screen<00:01:18.150> display<00:01:18.409> the<00:01:19.409> flaring

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
go to say on screen display the flaring

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.760 
go to say on screen display the flaring
goes<00:01:20.040> away<00:01:20.280> completely<00:01:21.500> anything<00:01:22.500> that's<00:01:22.650> on

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.140 
screen display doesn't show any kind of
distortion<00:01:25.650> but<00:01:26.100> as<00:01:26.220> soon<00:01:26.369> as<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.520> go<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.700> signal

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
distortion but as soon as I go to signal

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.200 
distortion but as soon as I go to signal
there's<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.390> problem<00:01:28.520> now<00:01:29.520> just<00:01:29.790> on<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.030> heat

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
there's a problem now just on the heat

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.530 
there's a problem now just on the heat
gun<00:01:30.479> trick<00:01:30.890> I've<00:01:31.890> heated<00:01:32.549> up<00:01:32.850> various<00:01:33.210> parts

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
gun trick I've heated up various parts

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.450 
gun trick I've heated up various parts
of<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.689> board's<00:01:34.110> both<00:01:34.500> power<00:01:34.860> supply<00:01:35.220> and

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
of the board's both power supply and

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.660 
of the board's both power supply and
mainboard<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.420> nothing<00:01:37.140> changes<00:01:37.710> nothing<00:01:38.369> at

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
mainboard and nothing changes nothing at

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.170 
mainboard and nothing changes nothing at
all<00:01:39.110> it's<00:01:40.110> just<00:01:40.200> solid<00:01:40.890> constant<00:01:41.700> problem

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
all it's just solid constant problem

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.770 
all it's just solid constant problem
I've<00:01:42.869> tried<00:01:43.140> tapping<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:44.600> haven't<00:01:45.600> pulled

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
I've tried tapping it I haven't pulled

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.780 
I've tried tapping it I haven't pulled
the<00:01:45.930> power<00:01:46.170> supply<00:01:46.500> part<00:01:46.950> but<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.250> capacitors

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
the power supply part but the capacitors

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.490 
the power supply part but the capacitors
aren't<00:01:48.060> venting<00:01:48.479> or<00:01:48.600> blowing<00:01:49.020> themselves<00:01:49.170> to

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
aren't venting or blowing themselves to

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
aren't venting or blowing themselves to
pieces<00:01:50.990> if<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.140> was<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.259> power<00:01:52.619> supply<00:01:52.829> problem

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
pieces if it was a power supply problem

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.249 
pieces if it was a power supply problem
I<00:01:53.640> imagine<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.149> ripple<00:01:54.479> would<00:01:54.630> be<00:01:54.750> affecting

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
I imagine the ripple would be affecting

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.620 
I imagine the ripple would be affecting
everything<00:01:55.680> from<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.549> display<00:01:56.909> like<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.509> on

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
everything from the display like the on

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.170 
everything from the display like the on
screen<00:01:57.990> display<00:01:58.140> itself<00:01:58.829> would<00:01:59.700> also<00:01:59.850> be

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
screen display itself would also be

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.149 
screen display itself would also be
getting<00:02:00.329> distortion<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.229> color<00:02:01.439> flaring<00:02:02.040> and

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
getting distortion and color flaring and

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.069 
getting distortion and color flaring and
all<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.369> sort<00:02:02.579> of<00:02:02.640> problem<00:02:04.280> so<00:02:05.689> not<00:02:06.689> really

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
all that sort of problem so not really

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.350 
all that sort of problem so not really
sure<00:02:07.320> on<00:02:07.350> this<00:02:07.710> one<00:02:07.979> I'm<00:02:08.209> guessing<00:02:09.209> it's

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
sure on this one I'm guessing it's

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.150 
sure on this one I'm guessing it's
probably<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.959> actual<00:02:10.289> color<00:02:10.530> drive<00:02:10.860> for<00:02:11.099> the

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
probably the actual color drive for the

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.920 
probably the actual color drive for the
panel<00:02:11.489> itself

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
panel itself

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.130

not<00:04:25.449> tapping<00:04:25.810> it<00:04:26.080> not<00:04:26.289> heating<00:04:26.860> it<00:04:26.979> up<00:04:27.099> or

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
not tapping it not heating it up or

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.210 
not tapping it not heating it up or
doing<00:04:27.729> anything<00:04:28.530> you<00:04:29.530> just<00:04:29.560> won't<00:04:29.830> get<00:04:30.009> rid<00:04:30.190> of

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
doing anything you just won't get rid of

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.339 
doing anything you just won't get rid of
it<00:04:31.530> so<00:04:32.530> yeah<00:04:32.770> that's<00:04:33.009> that<00:04:33.069> one<00:04:34.259> thanks<00:04:35.259> for

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
otherwise this thing's just going to be

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:40.830 
otherwise this thing's just going to be
probably<00:04:39.910> used<00:04:40.060> for<00:04:40.150> some<00:04:40.360> other<00:04:40.509> horrible

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
probably used for some other horrible
