00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:12.359
 our world is changing 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.240

 is dedicated to me and doom in this dark day 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:29.779
 while how far to the west 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.110
 the dark previous year threatens to devour everything and everyone 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.720
 shows again perhaps the hearts of 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.240

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.730
 that he is divided between himself and the threatened sinking 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.800
 to be able to set 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.760
 the war of wars 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.959

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:05.319
 spiced with every second more art closer 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.880
 neither percent too 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.180
 is just another step to avoid the abyss 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.900
 and to resist sitting here and putting my last will on paper 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.570
 already draw in my last battle 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.870
 I smile, I can not win 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.700
 with the deep underground the change take its course 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.250

 if it only seems to be about survival 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.900
 but even now the will and the greed for power are in the hearts of the 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.900
 mortal unlimited 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.580
 this war will lead us into it, said friend 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.740
 for the first time in my life
