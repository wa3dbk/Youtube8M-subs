00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:14.900
 good after and in six months half 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.870
 Word is because I've already run a race 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.690
 The honda now here you have whats good 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:23.540
 with the big beasts waiting 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.630
 I thought we had a good result 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.370
 and I did not drive very well in the car 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.490
 You start to make adjustments now 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:34.490
 right here all the time too short who 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.280
 You have to get the car if it ends with 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.530
 he has maintenance to do this 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.270
 already goes to the park closed today 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.040
 car already sleeps in the closed room 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.590
 so you do not have much time all over you 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.060
 You have to adjust in the event that doing 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.860
 a shift yourself if you want the 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:55.450
 Brazil 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:58.450
 winning often does not give time 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.480
 so it's too tight in vain to change 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.870
 like here between the belt and I think this 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.870
 is the most important 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.980
 i 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.940
 i 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.629
 op the people a really cool people actually 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.750
 was a circuit almost identical to the 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:05.150
 last year, then you can recognize 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.650
 so well the treatment boat very 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.360
 Good, have a back bed. I got two. 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.290
 laps in it has a protein 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:15.069
 survey reveals that the 13th 14th teikon 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:18.680
 final results are generally so has 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:20.599
 more than 60 cars that was a start 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.250
 positive the greatest longest test has 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:25.459
 be conservative because they are more 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:28.880
 of 400 kms a lot of stone a lot 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.560
 difficult and can happen then took already 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.390
 I was calmer at the last start to 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.019
 order to arrive between the ten 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.019
 goals 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:31.690
 not there finished the prologue of the race 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.150
 very good pizza bond walk 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.009
 we did a course with time well 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.729
 reasonable guess the second army 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:41.620
 place the third in the category then 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:44.759
 I hope we can tomorrow by following 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.759
 the same rhythm and get a good result
