shape<00:00:32.449> common<00:00:33.449> carp<00:00:33.690> got<00:00:33.900> started<00:00:34.290> in<00:00:34.379> a<00:00:34.470> lake

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:34.650 
shape common carp got started in a lake

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.490 
shape common carp got started in a lake
above<00:00:35.010> this<00:00:35.220> lake<00:00:35.570> that<00:00:36.570> lake<00:00:36.780> had<00:00:36.960> problems

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
above this lake that lake had problems

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.350 
above this lake that lake had problems
and<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.800> carp<00:00:38.040> really<00:00:38.309> took<00:00:38.489> off<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:39.059> became

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
and the carp really took off it became

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.450 
and the carp really took off it became
kind<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.720> rearing<00:00:40.050> pond<00:00:40.260> for<00:00:40.559> carp<00:00:40.800> they

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
kind of a rearing pond for carp they

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.520 
kind of a rearing pond for carp they
slowly<00:00:41.760> infiltrated<00:00:42.690> this<00:00:42.809> lake<00:00:43.080> and<00:00:43.110> they

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
slowly infiltrated this lake and they

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.160 
slowly infiltrated this lake and they
slowly<00:00:44.309> dominated<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.210> fisheries<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.110> the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
slowly dominated the fisheries and the

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.140 
slowly dominated the fisheries and the
bluegill<00:00:46.470> really<00:00:46.739> dropped<00:00:47.010> off<00:00:47.250> bass

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.150 
bluegill really dropped off bass

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.149 
bluegill really dropped off bass
population<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.930> water<00:00:49.170> clarity<00:00:49.589> became<00:00:49.949> very

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:50.159 
population the water clarity became very

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:53.270 
population the water clarity became very
turbid<00:00:50.699> how<00:00:51.600> bad<00:00:51.900> were<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.290> carp<00:00:52.530> in<00:00:52.710> here<00:00:52.920> you

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
turbid how bad were the carp in here you

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.180 
turbid how bad were the carp in here you
feel<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.519> horse<00:00:53.820> trough<00:00:54.150> in<00:00:54.420> 15<00:00:54.900> minutes<00:00:56.540> and<00:00:57.540> so

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
feel a horse trough in 15 minutes and so

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.430 
feel a horse trough in 15 minutes and so
probably<00:00:59.190> back<00:00:59.610> about<00:00:59.790> 2005<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.720> indicated

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
probably back about 2005 I indicated

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.380 
probably back about 2005 I indicated
that<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:02.220> time<00:01:02.460> was<00:01:02.610> going<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.850> come<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.269> we

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
that the time was going to come that we

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.939 
that the time was going to come that we
would<00:01:03.540> probably<00:01:03.750> need<00:01:03.900> to<00:01:04.019> rehabilitate<00:01:04.739> this

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
would probably need to rehabilitate this

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.649 
would probably need to rehabilitate this
lake<00:01:05.220> remove<00:01:05.729> all<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.030> fish<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.360> are<00:01:06.420> here

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
lake remove all the fish that are here

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.980 
lake remove all the fish that are here
and<00:01:06.780> start<00:01:07.020> all<00:01:07.170> over<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:08.270> we<00:01:09.270> got<00:01:09.780> that

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
and start all over and we got that

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.899 
and start all over and we got that
accomplished<00:01:10.590> now<00:01:10.920> this<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.159> on<00:01:11.400> year<00:01:11.670> too<00:01:11.880> and

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
accomplished now this is on year too and

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.200 
accomplished now this is on year too and
we're<00:01:12.869> going<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.080> see<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.380> results<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:14.210> how

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
we're going to see the results and how

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.660 
we're going to see the results and how
many<00:01:15.270> acres<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:15.750> this<00:01:15.960> like<00:01:16.170> it's<00:01:16.650> right<00:01:16.890> at<00:01:17.040> 36

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
many acres is this like it's right at 36

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.660 
many acres is this like it's right at 36
acres<00:01:17.850> so<00:01:18.479> it's<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.689> big<00:01:18.869> leg<00:01:19.110> yeah<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:20.460> took

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
acres so it's a big leg yeah and it took

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.910 
acres so it's a big leg yeah and it took
a<00:01:20.730> little<00:01:20.910> bit<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.210> work<00:01:21.660> with<00:01:21.870> the<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.560> human

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
a little bit of work with the the human

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.920 
a little bit of work with the the human
factor<00:01:23.190> getting<00:01:23.760> people<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.240> believe<00:01:24.600> that

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
factor getting people to believe that

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.690 
factor getting people to believe that
they<00:01:25.170> could<00:01:25.380> turn<00:01:25.800> this<00:01:25.950> lake<00:01:26.160> back<00:01:26.370> around

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
they could turn this lake back around

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.950 
they could turn this lake back around
and<00:01:26.910> how<00:01:27.660> quick<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.110> would<00:01:28.290> rebound<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:29.100> in

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
and how quick it would rebound that in

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640 
and how quick it would rebound that in

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
1987 ken russell this like it went

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.350 
1987 ken russell this like it went
through<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.830> same<00:01:35.040> process<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:35.970> had

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
through the same process and it had

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.570 
through the same process and it had
really<00:01:36.630> taken<00:01:36.930> off<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:37.560> some<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.160> these<00:01:38.280> lakes

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
really taken off so some of these lakes

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.040 
really taken off so some of these lakes
with<00:01:38.730> very<00:01:38.910> large<00:01:39.060> watersheds<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.930> the

may be on a 20 year cycle where we're
going<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.150> have<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.390> restart<00:01:45.840> them<00:01:46.050> and<00:01:46.280> take

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
going to have to restart them and take

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.890 
going to have to restart them and take
off<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.820> if<00:01:47.909> we<00:01:47.940> see<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.210> bunch<00:01:48.390> of<00:01:48.450> carpeted<00:01:48.810> a

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
spawn their growth rates probably gonna

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.170 
spawn their growth rates probably gonna
be<00:02:41.670> a<00:02:41.700> little<00:02:41.730> slow<00:02:43.760> may<00:02:44.760> take<00:02:44.970> some<00:02:45.120> time

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
be a little slow may take some time

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.730 
be a little slow may take some time
before<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.690> bass<00:02:45.870> catch<00:02:46.140> up<00:02:46.320> to<00:02:46.440> them<00:02:46.530> several

before the bass catch up to them several

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.180 
before the bass catch up to them several
years<00:02:47.070> before<00:02:47.490> it<00:02:47.610> may<00:02:48.560> stockpile<00:02:49.560> bass<00:02:49.860> and

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
years before it may stockpile bass and

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.160 
years before it may stockpile bass and
then<00:02:50.310> start<00:02:50.610> downsize<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:51.510> some<00:02:51.840> of<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:51.990> last

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
then start downsize and some of the last

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.260 
then start downsize and some of the last
but<00:02:52.440> yet<00:02:52.910> improving<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:53.970> bluegill

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
but yet improving the bluegill

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.600
