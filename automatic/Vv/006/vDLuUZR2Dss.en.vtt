 Hello everyone in today's video, I tell you 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.849
 I will show you how to make a pot with 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:12.070
 auto irrigation for seedlings or for flowers 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:13.990
 for making you will need 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.730
 plastic bottle with the same 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.010
 diameter in all its parts 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.900
 do not choose a bottle which diameter 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.940
 the neck is more than below because 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.390
 the top just won't fit in 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.970
 lower 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.340
 you will also need a stationery knife 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.920
 lace preferably thicker nails 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.529
 small screwdriver lighter or stove and 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.200
 earth with a flower or seeds that you 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.360
 want to plant let's get down for 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.850
 start heating the stationery knife on 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.010
 stove and share the bottle this way 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.829
 so that more is left at the bottom 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.930
 her part then heat two style 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.390
 screwdriver and make a hole in 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.850
 bottle cap we take a string and 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.190
 we tie a knot on one end so that it 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.829
 did not pass through the cork hole 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.530
 insert the lace into the cork and close 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.989
 bottle pour some water into the bottom 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.689
 part of the bottle and insert the top 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.759
 top of the land and put all or 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:09.520
 the flowers we want to plant 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:11.500
 wait about a day so that the water on the lace 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.780
 managed to moisten the whole earth 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.880
 I think that in the summer when many leave 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.860
 on the sea such a pot will be indispensable 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.170
 as much water can be poured 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.630
 which, if necessary, will go to 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.880
 plant if you like the idea 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.159
 making a pot with automatic watering 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.320
 of course like like write what 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:33.090
