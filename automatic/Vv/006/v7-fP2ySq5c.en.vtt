easily beats per se same thing right
side<00:01:46.170> is<00:01:46.860> definitely<00:01:47.369> my<00:01:47.460> weakest<00:01:47.790> side<00:01:47.939> when

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
side is definitely my weakest side when

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.139 
side is definitely my weakest side when
it<00:01:48.299> comes<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.659> waves<00:01:49.579> it's<00:01:50.579> too<00:01:50.729> weak<00:01:50.909> to

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
it comes to the waves it's too weak to

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.690

but ways to remedy that is one you get a

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.550 
but ways to remedy that is one you get a
little<00:01:54.530> not<00:01:55.530> so<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.829> little<00:01:56.159> hot<00:01:56.430> haircut<00:01:57.560> maybe
