00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.300
 or the people welcome another challenge 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.460
 well this case we bring a comment 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.560
 stepped on it more or less let's say that 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.820
 It can be a graphic service even if it is not 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.340
 we call the floor peak but good now 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.480
 you have what is the good case before 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.410
 nothing you talk about the game that this is a 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.879
 game of big black ops is a duel 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.320
 to death a long time ago I think 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:36.210
 that the partition is seven months so 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.309
 less the reason why this game 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.540
 which is not much truth that 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.160
 the score is very good but the 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.660
 I really knew because I do not have other 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.140
 books or I do not have another gameplay that 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.140
 climb up vale 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.810
 I have to record the games of modern 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.910
 warfare 3 that I have in movie mode 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.280
 accumulated I have a lot of games 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.230
 more I have good games of more 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.000
 confirmed by teams, I have to 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.530
 save and the bad things is that I have it 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 here the hd pvr so I have to throw 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.680
 of this material that is a bit old 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.120
 but one taking away a little the subject of 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.100
 gameplay and such I wanted to talk suite and a 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.170
 quite interesting thing good and that 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.670
 I think it concerns us all and it's the 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.040
 theme of motivation challenges 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.990
 personal things a person can do 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.180
 when you're motivated and you never get 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.220
 render on everything good let's start 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.290
 with that for example imagine that 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.869
 you want to be a doctor 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.979
 doctor vales is a very difficult career 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.659
 to do for example you have to study 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.100
 much 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.560
 The first thing you have to do if 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.240
 you want to be a doctor is really doing it 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.560
 because you like it, not because you want to win 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.030
 money and if your motivation is to win 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.049
 money for doing it, you can win 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.369
 money but it's always worth doing it with 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.649
 interest and you have to throw many 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.750
 hours you have to set a goal and 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.579
 reach it you have to be constant the 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.959
 activity that you perform you can not be 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.399
 one day plant barium put to 

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:48.869
 butt the bronze is a top day you're worth 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.670
 three hours four or five or six those that 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.740
 they have been studying and suddenly up to date 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.780
 next you are going strength in the ass 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.099
 and you do not do anything else like that they do not work 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.860
 Things have to have proof 

00:01:56.099 --> 00:02:01.200
 always every day we propose some 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.729
 goals and achieve them is worth the goals 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.250
 They are key and you have to follow them Sara 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.810
 this table another very important thing is 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.610
 the will of course you do not have to 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.019
 let no one get discouraged if someone 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.849
 He tells us that you can not do it 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.410
 you have to laugh in the background and think 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.819
 you think I can not do it well 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.829
 I'm going to show you how good I am 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.359
 you have to motivate them you have to 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:20.630
 do it also for people who 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:22.520
 you are capable in the case of what 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.050
 the difficulty is greater because in 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.460
 your environment is saying all the 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.950
 while you can not do it for the reason 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.780
 that is with your physical appearance by 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.910
 your way of thinking for whatever 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.290
 you have to have the strength of 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.550
 will from within say you're going to 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.280
 shut up and you're going to swallow your words 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.260
 that's very important, you do not have to 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.360
 to be beaten by anyone you have to 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.380
 go ahead with whatever you want a 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.910
 thing also very important in this is 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.860
 for example, I recommend you always 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.840
 do what you like, okay and if you 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.340
 like for example observe renderos seÃ¡is 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.870
 street sweepers even if they fuck 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.720
 of motivation should never be money 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.130
 although it can be but what I 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.840
 I recommend that this way you are going to be more 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.820
 happy is to do what you like for 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.810
 example me because I make videos on youtube 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.850
 I make videos on youtube as 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.320
 entertainment and apart has left me 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.640
 option to charge and why I'm not going to 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.440
 take it but I'm doing roll up what 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.940
 what I like most and apart I am 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.180
 also studying or trying to study what 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.190
 what I like then is basically that 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.990
 if you take something you like and try 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.960
 improve what you're going to do much better than 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.640
 with something you do not like 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.110
 and your personal satisfaction is going to be 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.910
 much greater and in fact your satisfaction 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.200
 personal will be greater even if in 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.090
 your surroundings tell you that you can not 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.980
 do what you are not able to do etc. 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.560
 You will feel much better 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.140
 when you see that your goals are 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.700
 they begin to reach little by little, and 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.050
 with this I mean you do not have 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.180
 a lot of time in your life life 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.220
 go by super super fast I already have 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.010
 22 years and I do not think I'm 22 years old 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:49.319
 I would tell you what to do 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:52.950
 I would say it looked like yesterday when I was 15 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:58.890
 years and I was in a park smoking me my 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:04:00.180
 first period in which he was 11 years old and 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.790
 I was messing with the first aunt 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.400
 good that it was a little earlier or things for 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.260
 the style does not pass life very far be 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.239
 very fast even though you now 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.470
 it seems that it happens a bit slow 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.750
 because many of these are in the 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.340
 school that is seems to spend a 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.109
 a little bit slower not because a lot 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.000
 people like the collection in order 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.410
 it happens very fast and with this what I want 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.239
 to say is that you have to look for your 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.750
 purpose and nomar gasteiz your time 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:26.420
 just spend your life for example 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.040
 and put in your house 24 hours 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.090
 of the day running out doing sports 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.910
 meet people laugh 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.260
 really take hours to study if 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.720
 you want to be better in the field 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.550
 do it but do not stay planted 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.130
 try to stand out in something always and if 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:44.400
 you want to be one more of the lot you can 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:46.650
 be logically no, you do not have to 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.000
 what not to stand out about nobody but good 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.250
 I am the advice not that you always 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.199
 you put a big motivation to 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.090
 to be able to reach it because whenever you 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:55.830
 you propose something very difficult and you get it 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.720
 do you feel much more accomplished 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.919
 much better then how good is it 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.520
 also gets happiness through 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:04.260
 of this method because basically it is to give 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.650
 a meaning to life set goals very 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.910
 tall 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.950
 I have been trying little by little 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.820
 reach them if you do not make a mark in life 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.870
 objectives motivations and you stay 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.510
 stagnant you stay in the emptiness 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:18.150
 you really start thinking to ramble on 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.970
 stay alone in yourself and that only 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:23.550
 brings problems are worth tenÃ©s that after 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.390
 that put the motivations and goals 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.910
 I'm going to give you 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:33.040
 that is to say a phrase that I love and 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:35.680
 he says it does not matter that life is short and 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.320
 it does not matter that you only live once if that 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.120
 it's been worth it and basically 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.200
 what with what what comes to say 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:48.190
 that phrase is that it does not matter what you do 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:50.860
 it does not matter if you live only once, it's worth it 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.840
 that what matters is what you do in the 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.910
 life and what matters is how you 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.430
 they will remember others or what matters is 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:59.560
 the legacy that you leave over your life to 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:04.000
 the others then for this I tell you 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:05.710
 basically never king dais never leave 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.320
 Nobody will sink you 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.600
 you know you are the best 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.460
 you can be it complexes us jce of nothing 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.770
 because you have nothing of what complex 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:17.050
 there have been wonderful people who 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:20.050
 being paralytic has reached goals 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:22.120
 incredible there have been people 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.349
 bright that it looked like I had it 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.360
 all done and in the end it's over 

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:27.699
 committing suicide as for example whoever 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.129
 the player a actorazo who made the 

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:31.509
 joker in batman so you can see that 

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:34.120
 all is not a path of roses that 

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:35.540
 although to the people so it seems more 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.910
 cojonuda 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:40.280
 life can actually make a change 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:42.020
 of overnight so we were 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.700

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.950
