00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 the gothard tunnel needs to be sanitized 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.870
 the question is how does the 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.360
 north-south traffic will be managed during 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.860
 repair work the proposal to 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.099
 build for it a second tunnel 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.199
 road is dangerous europe 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.910
 would receive a crazy signal that 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.650
 looks like Switzerland is on the road 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.830
 and that there is no reason to 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.539
 move goods to rail 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:28.320
 the number of trucks crossing the 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.150
 gothard then would double the transfer to 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.430
 rail is a much more solution 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.960
 effective during remediation there 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.690
 will have guÃ®nes by the railway tunnel 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.090
 existing between grenade and airolo and 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.480
 on the other hand the new base tunnel n 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.980
 women between Erstfeld and Biasca the 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.780
 heavy goods in transit will be 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.520
 transferred on the border rail 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.260
 Swiss already nearly eight hundred and twenty 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.449
 a thousand trucks are currently crossing the 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.640
 road tunnel by year the new 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.800
 ngefa base tunnel will allow for 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.010
 carry up to a million there will be 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.679
 so even reserves of capabilities 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.780
 for heavy traffic indigenous small 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:06.240
 loading terminals in erstfeld and 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.390
 biasca can be upgraded to less 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.970
 fresh but what about the traffic of 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.920
 private cars in the summer the tunnel 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.080
 road will normally connect 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.780
 airolo sanitation works 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.610
 will only take place in winter off-peak period 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.340
 during which a load will be 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.409
 organized for cars a car train 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.270
 you will comfortably cross the 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.259
 railway tunnel in a range of 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.869
 a few minutes 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:35.009
 this capacity is more than enough 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.929
 sanitation with solution 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.460
 transfer costs 3 billion less 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:40.560
 than a second road tunnel 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.750
 it also guarantees that a large part 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.190
 heavy traffic is finally transferred to 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.289
 rail 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.330
 in addition after the sanitation the 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:50.569
 road tunnel will be wider better 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.100
 illuminated and thanks to central slide 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:55.369
 retractable as safe as two tunnels 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.369
 separated
