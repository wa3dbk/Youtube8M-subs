This is just a brief indoor test of the Nikon
D5300 with an 18 to 140mm AF-S lens and it'll

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:43.890
be in the description what specific lens this
is and I have to set focus mode AF-F which

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:51.670
is full time servo which would uh focus on
moving objects now the best setting to use

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:58.640
if you're close and there's not a lot of movement
that you're recording would be manual focus

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.970
or you could also use AF-S which you have
to push the shutter button down halfway to

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:11.039
get the camera to focus and then record your
video but manual focus probably works the

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:17.110
best because uh with this mode that I am using
right now you may hear some lens movement

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:24.690
noise when the camera tries to focus uh so
if you use manual that eliminates that sound

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.540
of course and there's really no way to get
rid of that lens movement noise completely

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:38.480
unless you use manual focus or if you use
an external microphone that is a few feet

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.520
away from the actual camera or maybe at least
one foot or twelve inches

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.820
away from the camera uh the Nikon ME-1 does

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:54.019
not remove the sound completely and I've noticed
that by watching several videos I haven't

00:02:54.019 --> 00:03:00.100
had any personal experience with it myself
but that's what I noticed when watching people

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:07.360
who made videos using the ME-1 so there's
really no way to do it unless you use an external

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.940
mic that's quite a far ways away or if you
use manual focus and there's not a lot of

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:24.420
action in your video this part was shot at
1080p HD at 24 frames per second in focus mode AF-F
