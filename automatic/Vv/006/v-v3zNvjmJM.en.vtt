 why attend a wargaming event here 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.140
 five more days of holidays can be spent 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.700
 much more interesting things that our 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.080
 children have never painted or seen 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.360

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.860
 we will not find a free constructor 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.179
 prem tank or such a big problem 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.160

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.369
 what is the name of marriage? 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.480
 not quite in place but it's true 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.189
 tens of thousands of tickets to 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.020
 a holiday which was arranged as wargaming 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.670
 usually went pretty quickly but judging 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.260
 the occupancy of the hall hit 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.660
 Olympic is not all of those who 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.340
 signed up and received an invitation to be 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.809
 very sorry if wargaming will take it 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.430
 as a lesson and next time either will 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.170
 be heard much more invitation than 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.640
 will be able to accommodate the playground to someone 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.890
 have to chug outside and remember 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.120
 kind word optional people for 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.160
 tickets will just become simple 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.559
 sell money spent great 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.120
 motivate to be necessarily but in this 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.660
 once again the visit was perfect 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.910

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.559
 sign up and go and think what 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.579
 for those who booked a place for themselves but not 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.290
 got to the Olympic 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.119
 Be very sorry for that, whether or not 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.540
 circumstances forced to do other 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.310
 affairs 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.740
 because there was something to look at and 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.150

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.220
 earn and what wargaming spends 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.750
 a similar event is that this company

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.500
