00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.859
 in a joyous day, may it be said that then 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.899
 can not miss 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.820
 as the name of bd suggests , it warms up 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.559
 traditional saints celebrations 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.099
 that happen all over the world. 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.080
 Brazil 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.849
 this time of year, this is the beauty of 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.880
 some places what is then done with 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.830
 wine in others with the cachaÃ§a plus one 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.289
 ingredient that can not be missing and which is 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.660
 common the two is the ginger 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.630
 he is responsible for the strong taste and 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.160
 accent of the drink in Santa Catarina 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.900
 this plant has been arousing interest 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.120
 of farmers 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.190
 this is because the market is promising since 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.250
 Brazil imports most of what 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.250
 consumes 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:45.120
 ginger is a plant native to the 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.160
 asia known more than two thousand years 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.320
 aerial to reach a height of 80 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.750
 centimeters to one meter 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.780
 although it is called ginger root 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.730
 in fact a rhizome or a stem 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.489
 which grows underground 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.309
 ginger one of the most 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.619
 popular in the world it has sweet taste 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.380
 and slightly spicy and is exactly 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.330
 spicy taste or great responsibility for 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.090
 success of culture success in 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:16.200
 gastronomy in medicine and in the 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.420
 valdemar farmer who say 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.490
 he has been cultivating ginger since the 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.689
 90 on your property in the municipality of 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.640
 Antonio Carlos 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.619
 just over 30 kilometers from 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.630
 capital of Santa Catarina 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.700
 I received this culture because of a 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.030
 income I enjoyed the income that was 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.130
 enough to keep the whole family 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.960
 and everyone working in the deployment 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.150
 Ginger and I really like it too. 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.810
 gum smell of time the smell 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.810
 it's important 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.729
 the planting of ginger should be done 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.520
 between August and will not enter wet soil 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.770
 well- drained the success of culture 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.590
 begins with the choice of molt as 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.770
 your valdemar ginger seedling is the 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.929
 the main beginning of the planting until 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.479
 I knew if the change was not good. 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:04.490
 knew soon after his planting will 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.959
 give problem then first it 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.629
 It has to be very beautiful. 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:10.310
 you look she breaks she has to have 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:12.080
 this color well love is line can not 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.200
 dark always dark 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.880
 she is sick she is in need 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.769
 that she has a problem then 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.170
 then it will appear in your planting if 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:24.170
 You plant this piece is sick. 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.060
 then when the scene is going to be born is the 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.879
 but does not develop 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.379
 she comes back and if she knows, that's what she gives 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:32.450
 very good production 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:35.360
 the plant likes high temperature 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.400
 between 25 and 30 degrees 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.190
 the planting should be done in flowerbeds 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.590
 distant one and a half meters from each other 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.200
 the seedlings should be 30 centimeters 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.569
 distance between each other and 10 centimeters 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.930
 below the ground so they can grow 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:53.060
 to the sides and upwards growing the 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:59.209
 rhizome should be covered with soil but 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:01.370
 can not be exposed after 10 months 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.670
 the ginger matures is ready to 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.709
 harvest when she is mature 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.859
 sheet is the beginning of the 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:12.919
 presentation on the sheet it starts from above 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:14.930
 from the tip of the foot to the bottom 

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:16.760
 when she has and then 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.590
 to present was the flower that the 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.930
 ginger which is also very important 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.450
 there you see that she is already beautiful 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.459
 I knew who it was so full of 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.840
 shoots the more you sprout the more 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.410
 Beautiful, she is later when you go 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.419
 Spoon 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.519
 she's beautiful like my perfect 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:33.819
 people are very beautiful this year being the 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.819
 beautiful 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:44.060
 and indeed the harvest is manual 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.110
 collection has different ways of doing 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.850
 make actor 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.490
 I have everything prepared but I do not 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:52.220
 I use it for now is because manual is 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:54.200
 better not break so much when the tractor 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.000
 breaks many people open then as the 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.490
 People want to present a good gibbon. 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.830
 how is the trade here tank is the 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:03.260
 greater with trade is to have a product 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.830
 beautiful then it has to be she can not 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.870
 be very broken 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.640
 as well as in planting to harvest involves 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.670
 the work of the family of his 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.470
 of a molt grows a foot with 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.260
 about four pounds 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.220
 already the production of one hectare reaches 40 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.100
 tons 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:25.810
 after harvesting the ginger passes through 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:33.530
 a selection to then be washed 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:35.480
 boxed and then for sale after 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.540
 ginger harvest the sun should receive 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.970
 the culture only three years after 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.190
 period epagri indicates the rotation of 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.050
 cultures as well as diversify the 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.020
 activities and increase income in 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.340
 this practice brings benefits 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.980
 for the environment 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:56.000
 in fact the soil has a 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:58.010
 regeneration and the plant that is not 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.720
 can be grown ginger again 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.570
 in this area because it will present 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:05.360
 some diseases occurring in the 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:07.940
 only some pest insects that can 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.340
 prejudice a new culture in the 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.620
 It is suggested that the rotation of 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.530
 cultures that the next crop is not 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.480
 the same family where you will not then have 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.610
 the incidence of these same pests and 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.610
 diseases or pathogens will not 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:25.700
 affect culture and breaks the cycle of this 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:29.870
 pathogen avoiding excessive use of 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:32.630
 agricultural pesticides and pesticides and even 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.850
 fertilization is reduced per case of fertilization 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:37.790
 that already exists in the soil itself right 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:41.300
 culture and then facilitates the 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:43.070
 management for the farmer and some for the 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.530
 environment as a whole is not 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:49.479
 facilitating and lowering then is whether this 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.479
 excessive use of pesticides 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:05.010
 ginger is widely used in 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.950
 food industry and you can 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:09.450
 find it also as oil or powder 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:11.790
 commercial characteristics of the 

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:14.070
 plant stimulated and valdemar to enlarge 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:15.810
 the production that this year reached 70 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:18.450
 tonnes and which should be 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.190
 national and international market 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:22.320
 according to the farmer the profit with 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:24.650
 culture reaches up to three times the 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.650
 invested
