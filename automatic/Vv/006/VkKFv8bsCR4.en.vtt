gallon planet tank I have here alright
let's<00:00:20.850> start<00:00:21.060> off<00:00:21.240> okay<00:00:21.600> I<00:00:21.810> don't<00:00:22.410> have<00:00:22.529> the

let's start off okay I don't have the

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.740 
let's start off okay I don't have the
most<00:00:22.830> like<00:00:23.100> diverse<00:00:23.820> range<00:00:24.119> of<00:00:24.240> plants<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.660> I

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
most like diverse range of plants and I

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.000 
most like diverse range of plants and I
still<00:00:25.050> have<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.170> decent<00:00:25.470> amount<00:00:25.500> in<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.800> small

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
still have a decent amount in the small

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.849 
still have a decent amount in the small
tank<00:00:26.250> though<00:00:26.510> but<00:00:27.510> um<00:00:27.689> biggest<00:00:28.230> thing<00:00:28.320> I<00:00:28.470> could

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
tank though but um biggest thing I could

tank though but um biggest thing I could
say<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.340> start<00:00:29.580> off<00:00:29.699> with<00:00:29.939> is<00:00:30.119> get<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.050> good

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
say to start off with is get a good

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:31.939 
say to start off with is get a good
substrate

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
substrate

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.670 
substrate
I<00:00:32.300> chose<00:00:33.300> fluorite<00:00:33.750> it's<00:00:34.230> really<00:00:34.440> high<00:00:34.559> in

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
I chose fluorite it's really high in

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.740 
I chose fluorite it's really high in
iron<00:00:34.850> get<00:00:35.850> one<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.059> those<00:00:36.120> substrates<00:00:36.600> you

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
iron get one of those substrates you

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.209 
iron get one of those substrates you
could<00:00:36.870> even<00:00:36.989> go<00:00:37.140> dirt<00:00:37.380> but<00:00:37.649> just<00:00:37.860> watch<00:00:37.980> this

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
could even go dirt but just watch this

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.069 
could even go dirt but just watch this
dirts<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.579> little<00:00:38.760> messy<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.660> if<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.899> leaks

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
dirts a little messy and if it leaks

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.229 
dirts a little messy and if it leaks
through<00:00:40.440> it'll<00:00:40.739> um<00:00:40.950> lead<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.730> an<00:00:41.790> algae<00:00:42.059> bloom

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
through it'll um lead to an algae bloom

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.450 
through it'll um lead to an algae bloom
I<00:00:42.450> like<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.410> have<00:00:43.530> sand<00:00:43.770> on<00:00:43.950> top<00:00:43.980> because<00:00:44.399> I

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
I like to have sand on top because I

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.830 
I like to have sand on top because I
think<00:00:44.520> it's<00:00:44.700> aesthetically<00:00:45.300> pleasing<00:00:45.390> but

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
think it's aesthetically pleasing but

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.180 
think it's aesthetically pleasing but
doesn't<00:00:46.260> really<00:00:46.379> matter<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.739> can<00:00:46.829> just<00:00:46.860> golf

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
doesn't really matter you can just golf

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.650 
doesn't really matter you can just golf
alright<00:00:47.520> that's<00:00:47.789> easier<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.180> plant<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.570> way

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
alright that's easier to plant that way

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.229 
alright that's easier to plant that way
I<00:00:48.690> think<00:00:49.370> biggest<00:00:50.370> thing<00:00:50.670> if<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:50.910> look<00:00:51.030> like

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
I think biggest thing if you look like

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.540 
I think biggest thing if you look like
fish<00:00:51.750> tanks<00:00:52.110> TV<00:00:52.440> Dustin's<00:00:52.980> fishtanks<00:00:53.190> he

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
fish tanks TV Dustin's fishtanks he

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.220 
fish tanks TV Dustin's fishtanks he
talks<00:00:53.789> about<00:00:53.910> on<00:00:54.239> plants<00:00:54.840> like<00:00:54.960> receiving

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
talks about on plants like receiving

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.099 
talks about on plants like receiving
like<00:00:55.530> 400<00:00:55.920> times<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.399> amount<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.360> iron<00:00:57.539> from

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
like 400 times the amount of iron from

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.930 
like 400 times the amount of iron from
the<00:00:58.199> roots<00:00:58.500> versus<00:00:58.890> their<00:00:59.010> Leafs<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.789> the

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
the roots versus their Leafs and the

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.599 
the roots versus their Leafs and the
water<00:01:00.210> column<00:01:00.539> so<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:01.680> really<00:01:02.160> don't<00:01:02.309> even<00:01:02.370> use

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
water column so I really don't even use

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.100 
water column so I really don't even use
any<00:01:03.000> fertilizers<00:01:03.539> anymore<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.930> tell<00:01:04.019> you

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
any fertilizers anymore to tell you

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.950 
any fertilizers anymore to tell you
truth<00:01:04.970> as<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.090> can<00:01:06.210> see<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.360> have<00:01:06.510> some<00:01:06.600> purling

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
truth as you can see I have some purling

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.500 
truth as you can see I have some purling
going<00:01:07.229> on<00:01:07.350> but<00:01:07.710> um<00:01:08.119> biggest<00:01:09.119> thing<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.330> think

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
going on but um biggest thing I think

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.170 
going on but um biggest thing I think
you<00:01:09.600> should<00:01:09.780> do<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.260> just<00:01:10.740> use<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.400> smite<00:01:12.030> room

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
you should do is I just use a smite room

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.830 
you should do is I just use a smite room
here<00:01:12.420> Pellegrino<00:01:13.350> bottle<00:01:14.330> and<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.540> changed

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
here Pellegrino bottle and I changed

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.679 
here Pellegrino bottle and I changed
about<00:01:15.960> every<00:01:16.200> week<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.500> half<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:17.360> has<00:01:18.360> a

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
about every week and a half and has a

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.800 
about every week and a half and has a
drop<00:01:18.960> checker<00:01:19.200> on<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.500> but<00:01:19.650> case<00:01:20.009> overflows

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
drop checker on it but case overflows

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.440 
drop checker on it but case overflows
but<00:01:21.810> it's<00:01:21.960> nothing<00:01:22.729> elaborate<00:01:23.729> just<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.240> tube

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
but it's nothing elaborate just a tube

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.420 
but it's nothing elaborate just a tube
like<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.920> it<00:01:25.920> runs<00:01:26.189> down<00:01:26.460> pine<00:01:26.930> and

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
like that it runs down pine and

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.670 
like that it runs down pine and
literally<00:01:29.430> goes<00:01:30.119> right<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.509> here<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.530> the

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
literally goes right to here and the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.260 
literally goes right to here and the
thing<00:01:31.860> this<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.159> necessity<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:32.820> think<00:01:33.060> if<00:01:33.180> you

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
thing this is a necessity I think if you

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.240 
thing this is a necessity I think if you
want<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.479> have<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.630> nice<00:01:33.840> plan<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.290> tank<00:01:34.500> what's

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
want to have a nice plan of tank what's

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.550 
want to have a nice plan of tank what's
a<00:01:35.460> little<00:01:35.610> bit<00:01:35.790> more<00:01:36.290> what<00:01:37.290> some<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.500> the

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
a little bit more what some of the

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.960 
a little bit more what some of the
plants<00:01:37.829> are<00:01:37.920> like<00:01:38.100> slightly<00:01:38.369> harder<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.790> keep

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
plants are like slightly harder to keep

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.170 
plants are like slightly harder to keep
medium-range<00:01:39.960> too<00:01:40.860> easy<00:01:41.009> not<00:01:41.430> hard<00:01:41.460> but<00:01:42.030> um

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
medium-range too easy not hard but um

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.630 
medium-range too easy not hard but um
you<00:01:43.170> need<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.350> nano<00:01:43.860> defuser

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
you need a nano defuser

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.280 
you need a nano defuser
for<00:01:45.119> like<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.299> smaller<00:01:45.570> tank<00:01:45.810> or<00:01:45.960> any<00:01:46.079> type<00:01:46.259> of

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
for like a smaller tank or any type of

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.940 
for like a smaller tank or any type of
co2<00:01:46.770> diffuser<00:01:47.450> that<00:01:48.450> way<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.290> get<00:01:49.500> co2

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
co2 diffuser that way you get co2

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
can you could get one where you can run

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.649

it<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.640> power<00:01:53.820> head<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.210> then<00:01:54.299> dissolve

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.969 
almost like 90% efficiency but this
works<00:01:57.840> fine<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:58.439> also<00:01:58.560> have<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.799> drop

checker to check like where my co2 level
is<00:02:01.290> it's<00:02:01.409> slightly<00:02:01.500> higher<00:02:01.740> right<00:02:02.070> now<00:02:02.189> but

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
is it's slightly higher right now but

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.620 
is it's slightly higher right now but
that's<00:02:02.610> okay<00:02:04.070> besides<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.549> I'd<00:02:06.180> say<00:02:06.390> start

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
wise what a tank like this I think the

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:11.960 
wise what a tank like this I think the
least<00:03:11.160> maintenance<00:03:11.550> is<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.790> best

maintenance honestly where you do um
just<00:03:15.090> like<00:03:15.180> a<00:03:15.210> little<00:03:15.420> little<00:03:15.900> changes<00:03:16.290> here

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
just like a little little changes here

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.920 
just like a little little changes here
and<00:03:16.530> there<00:03:17.360> just<00:03:18.360> try<00:03:18.480> to<00:03:18.540> keep<00:03:18.690> it<00:03:18.810> on<00:03:18.900> a

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
and there just try to keep it on a

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.180 
and there just try to keep it on a
