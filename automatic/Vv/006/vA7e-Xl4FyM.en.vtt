00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
light to pass through the mirror and

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.730 
light to pass through the mirror and
spill<00:01:08.330> onto<00:01:08.479> the<00:01:08.690> autofocus<00:01:09.110> array<00:01:09.560> which

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
spill onto the autofocus array which

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.219 
spill onto the autofocus array which
allows<00:01:10.040> for<00:01:10.399> full<00:01:11.060> time<00:01:11.420> phase<00:01:11.869> detection

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
allows for full time phase detection

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.130 
allows for full time phase detection
autofocus<00:01:12.610> even<00:01:13.610> through<00:01:13.759> the<00:01:13.790> LCD<00:01:14.360> so<00:01:14.869> i<00:01:14.899> can

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
autofocus even through the LCD so i can

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.660 
autofocus even through the LCD so i can
now<00:01:15.259> hold<00:01:15.530> this<00:01:15.619> up<00:01:15.860> here<00:01:16.130> and<00:01:16.340> feed<00:01:16.520> these

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
now hold this up here and feed these

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.639 
now hold this up here and feed these
birds<00:01:16.940> and<00:01:17.210> hopefully<00:01:17.479> not<00:01:17.660> lose<00:01:17.840> a<00:01:17.869> finger

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:27.880 

hey<00:01:21.649> oh<00:01:22.899> hey<00:01:26.020> looks<00:01:27.020> like<00:01:27.080> i<00:01:27.260> almost<00:01:27.530> just<00:01:27.590> lost

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
hey oh hey looks like i almost just lost

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.410 
hey oh hey looks like i almost just lost
a<00:01:28.040> Zeiss<00:01:28.250> lens<00:01:28.610> that's<00:01:28.790> a<00:01:28.880> pretty<00:01:29.060> expensive

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
a Zeiss lens that's a pretty expensive

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:39.550 
a Zeiss lens that's a pretty expensive
bird<00:01:29.810> food<00:01:30.020> right<00:01:30.290> there

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.380 

so<00:01:40.560> we're<00:01:40.710> here<00:01:40.890> with<00:01:41.010> a<00:01:41.040> Sony<00:01:41.310> 858<00:01:42.120> it's<00:01:42.300> an

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
so we're here with a Sony 858 it's an

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.000 
so we're here with a Sony 858 it's an
entry-level<00:01:42.720> camera<00:01:43.260> that<00:01:43.409> still<00:01:43.650> has<00:01:43.830> that

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
entry-level camera that still has that

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.430 
entry-level camera that still has that

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
SLT technology in which is great for

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
off into ostrich land and see if we can

00:01:50.010 --> 00:02:00.730 
off into ostrich land and see if we can
catch<00:01:50.160> some<00:01:50.220> 40<00:01:50.700> mile<00:01:50.820> an<00:01:50.850> hour<00:01:51.030> birds
