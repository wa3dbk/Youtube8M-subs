00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.190
 the coming on the youtube channel of the site 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.800
 internet in the year points like 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.600
 today I'm going to leave on a 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.060
 discovery then the glass is not my 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.020
 favorite color but we will try to 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.660
 do one thing anyway relatively 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.240
 nice with green so for the base here 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.369
 I took the chebel 510 already taken a 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:36.970
 second green color a little bit more 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:36.970
 nice the 542 so I'm going to m 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:59.570
 I will stamp the surplus is not 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:05.630
 to make a gradient but it's okay 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:09.100
 it will make a background a crazy two-color what 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.100
 a little snatch 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.740
 That's what happens 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:21.980
 if so there are places where there will be 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:30.200
 so a heavy past the foliage plaque 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:34.610
 at 0.01 and I will use these designers 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:39.790
 there I take my plastic scraper like 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:43.720
 I usually miss my stamp with my 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.720
 rectangular recalling name 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.250
 here 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.970
 so there as usual we take a step 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:28.459
 solvent and we come clean all 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:30.690
 what we put on the skin so in the end 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.819
 that's what gives it that gives an effect 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:37.080
 young people absolutely nice so with a 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:40.680
 two-tone glass fauna so a glass a 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.930
 unclear it was 510 from bell is 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:47.340
 a little bit more turquoise green it was 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:50.700
 the 542 still from ebel and stamped 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.459
 with black there I took the conad and 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.220
 so the foliage plaque is the plaque 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.599
 of the foliage anel at 0.01 that you 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.390
 find on the site at the year 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:06.290
 points like and so these were the reasons 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.290
 during the first layer india 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.770
 see you soon for a next video
