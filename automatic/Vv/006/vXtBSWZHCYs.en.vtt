00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
aren't actually that good so it is kind

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.719 
aren't actually that good so it is kind
of<00:01:00.970> even<00:01:01.360> but<00:01:01.780> mine<00:01:02.710> just<00:01:02.860> had<00:01:03.040> work<00:01:03.309> morale

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:03.729 
of even but mine just had work morale

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:07.620 
of even but mine just had work morale
when<00:01:04.629> we<00:01:04.809> went<00:01:04.960> into<00:01:05.140> it<00:01:05.320> so<00:01:06.210> sort<00:01:07.210> of<00:01:07.270> fated<00:01:07.600> to

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
when we went into it so sort of fated to

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:14.010 
when we went into it so sort of fated to
lose<00:01:07.930> but<00:01:12.090> even<00:01:13.090> though<00:01:13.210> it's<00:01:13.390> hopeless<00:01:13.600> we're

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
lose but even though it's hopeless we're

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.930 
lose but even though it's hopeless we're
going<00:01:14.140> to<00:01:14.200> continue<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:17.430> basically<00:01:18.430> until<00:01:18.729> the

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
going to continue to basically until the

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.910 
going to continue to basically until the
last<00:01:19.119> man<00:01:19.390> or<00:01:19.810> until<00:01:20.200> everyone<00:01:20.590> runs<00:01:20.799> away

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
last man or until everyone runs away

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.750 
last man or until everyone runs away
because<00:01:22.979> we're<00:01:23.979> defending<00:01:24.400> here<00:01:24.549> for

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
because we're defending here for

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.960 
because we're defending here for
Gibraltar<00:01:25.240> and<00:01:26.790> unless<00:01:27.790> the<00:01:27.909> army<00:01:28.150> wins<00:01:29.970> the

Gibraltar and unless the army wins the
territory<00:01:31.450> is<00:01:31.540> lost<00:01:31.780> so<00:01:32.049> there's<00:01:32.320> no<00:01:32.439> point<00:01:32.710> in

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
territory is lost so there's no point in

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:38.249 
territory is lost so there's no point in
trying<00:01:32.950> to<00:01:33.280> save<00:01:33.460> droops<00:01:33.880> or<00:01:34.420> anything<00:01:37.259> it's

troops<00:02:19.040> got<00:02:20.040> freed<00:02:20.340> up<00:02:20.550> and<00:02:20.790> then<00:02:21.390> they<00:02:21.570> were

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
troops got freed up and then they were

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:29.770

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
my gorillas are moving now so they won't

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.230

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
canister shot it would have made a huge

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.450 
canister shot it would have made a huge
difference<00:02:39.380> I<00:02:40.380> do<00:02:40.890> not<00:02:41.160> have<00:02:41.550> that<00:02:42.860> which<00:02:43.860> will

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:32.409 
peace before I overextend myself because

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:37.559 
peace before I overextend myself because
I<00:05:33.360> think<00:05:35.669> Gibraltar<00:05:36.669> is<00:05:36.819> pretty<00:05:37.179> much<00:05:37.329> the

00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:37.569 
I think Gibraltar is pretty much the

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:40.439 
I think Gibraltar is pretty much the
best<00:05:37.749> they<00:05:37.899> can<00:05:37.959> get<00:05:38.789> unless<00:05:39.789> they<00:05:39.969> build<00:05:40.269> up<00:05:40.389> a

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:40.449 
best they can get unless they build up a

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:43.139 
best they can get unless they build up a
navy<00:05:40.689> and<00:05:40.809> start<00:05:41.259> taking<00:05:41.409> my<00:05:42.159> colonies<00:05:42.999> or

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:43.149 
navy and start taking my colonies or

00:05:43.149 --> 00:05:50.669 
navy and start taking my colonies or
something<00:05:43.509> because<00:05:44.849> I<00:05:47.909> just<00:05:48.909> think<00:05:49.679> they

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:50.679 
something because I just think they

00:05:50.679 --> 00:05:52.739 
something because I just think they
won't<00:05:50.889> have<00:05:51.129> the<00:05:51.369> men<00:05:51.789> to<00:05:52.239> get<00:05:52.359> all<00:05:52.539> the<00:05:52.629> way<00:05:52.719> to

00:05:52.739 --> 00:05:52.749 
won't have the men to get all the way to

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:57.539 
won't have the men to get all the way to
Madrid<00:05:53.199> because<00:05:53.979> I<00:05:54.519> can<00:05:55.679> if<00:05:56.679> I<00:05:56.799> really<00:05:57.219> need<00:05:57.399> to

00:05:57.539 --> 00:05:57.549 
Madrid because I can if I really need to

00:05:57.549 --> 00:06:00.479 
Madrid because I can if I really need to
I<00:05:57.579> can<00:05:57.729> train<00:05:58.089> armies<00:05:58.479> fast<00:05:58.989> in<00:05:59.229> Madrid<00:05:59.589> and<00:06:00.339> I

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:00.489 
I can train armies fast in Madrid and I

00:06:00.489 --> 00:06:02.579 
I can train armies fast in Madrid and I
don't<00:06:00.579> much<00:06:00.909> money<00:06:01.209> I<00:06:01.299> can<00:06:01.449> sacrifice<00:06:02.049> in

00:06:02.579 --> 00:06:02.589 
don't much money I can sacrifice in

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:04.439 
don't much money I can sacrifice in
other<00:06:02.799> areas<00:06:03.249> because<00:06:03.669> Madrid<00:06:04.089> is<00:06:04.179> the<00:06:04.239> most

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:04.449 
other areas because Madrid is the most

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:14.110 
other areas because Madrid is the most
important<00:06:04.929> territory<00:06:05.349> in<00:06:05.469> my<00:06:05.589> whole<00:06:05.679> entire

before<00:06:25.340> well<00:06:25.940> I<00:06:25.970> can't<00:06:26.240> really<00:06:26.389> read<00:06:26.630> it<00:06:26.750> now

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:26.900 
before well I can't really read it now

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 
but I just memorized it after our first

but I just memorized it after our first
battle<00:06:37.130> that<00:06:37.970> we<00:06:38.090> just<00:06:38.270> had<00:06:38.479> a<00:06:38.810> few<00:06:39.530> episodes

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 
battle that we just had a few episodes

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.740 
battle that we just had a few episodes
ago<00:06:40.070> it<00:06:40.310> wasn't<00:06:40.460> the<00:06:40.580> first<00:06:40.790> battle<00:06:41.060> but<00:06:41.090> after

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:41.750 
ago it wasn't the first battle but after

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:46.750 
ago it wasn't the first battle but after
