00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 And now we will have a game that will feature nothing more nothing 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 less than the participation of you, our audience once again! 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 We need bizarre, strange objects, anything that 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 you have brought in your bag, be it a Modys, or a 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 Tec, whatever you have there. 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 Please, send it here, because it's our boys' time. 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 improvise situations with the objects you have. 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 You can! 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 We got a little pot of milk here. 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 We have a beautiful purse! 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 I think that's enough guys! 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 We'd better stop here. 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 It's all right! 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 Let's choose here an object for the duo Mauro and Evilasio 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 A... 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 ESPARADRAPO! 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 This is what I was thinking. 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 to you! And to our dear friends Tiago and Nelson? 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 The modys can not be left, right? 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 Ladies and gentlemen, I already, I return the objects, less 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 the cepacol because then I'm going to go out for a little ballad 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 So let's start, the scene starts with Mauro and Evilasio. 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 Worth it! 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 Sonny, you can poop in the privadinha that I bought for you! 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 All right, Mom! 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 Wonderful! It's the same as Pedrinho's 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 You do not know what I have here! 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 What do you mean, what do you have there? 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 I have the last card from the cup album! And the player 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 the player is beaten! 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 Honey I brought you here on this fantastic night, so 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 That's why we want to get married. 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 with me? 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 It's beautiful, my love, it's hard to leave, right? 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 Boy, will you take the card? 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 Which one do you have? 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 MerdCard! 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 ESPARADRAPO! 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 It's ... FOR ... Shoot! It's ... FOR ... Shoot! 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 If you are at home and want to see a cool movie, 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 instant popcorn that already comes with ketchup! 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 Is ready? 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 I'm afraid, Doctor. 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 It's very simple as I'll show here. 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 put my finger 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 Calm down, I'm going to get your mouth back! 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 Open the mouth! 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 It's already full of blood already! 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 Let's not see what he's going to win! Turn the wheel!
