00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.419 

I<00:00:00.140> recently<00:00:01.140> opened<00:00:01.650> up<00:00:01.680> a<00:00:01.800> laptop<00:00:02.159> battery

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
I recently opened up a laptop battery

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:04.130 
I recently opened up a laptop battery
pack<00:00:02.610> and<00:00:02.760> I<00:00:02.820> found<00:00:03.030> these<00:00:03.179> strikingly<00:00:03.810> blue

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
pack and I found these strikingly blue

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.179 
pack and I found these strikingly blue
Panasonic's<00:00:04.950> EGR<00:00:05.460> 18<00:00:05.940> 650<00:00:06.330> C<00:00:07.230> cells<00:00:07.799> and

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
Panasonic's EGR 18 650 C cells and

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.890 
Panasonic's EGR 18 650 C cells and
they're<00:00:08.849> very<00:00:09.030> interesting<00:00:09.540> just<00:00:09.660> because

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
they're very interesting just because

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.169 
they're very interesting just because
they're<00:00:10.110> blue<00:00:10.670> unfortunately<00:00:11.670> I<00:00:11.700> don't<00:00:11.910> find

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
they're blue unfortunately I don't find

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.879 
they're blue unfortunately I don't find
many<00:00:12.330> Panasonic<00:00:12.990> cells<00:00:13.230> even<00:00:13.530> though<00:00:13.620> I<00:00:13.650> hear

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
many Panasonic cells even though I hear

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.829 
many Panasonic cells even though I hear
that<00:00:14.190> they're<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.490> best<00:00:14.700> and<00:00:15.030> every<00:00:15.690> single

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
that they're the best and every single

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.439 
that they're the best and every single
cell<00:00:16.529> that<00:00:16.710> I<00:00:16.740> found<00:00:17.130> has<00:00:17.820> been<00:00:18.060> pretty<00:00:18.240> much<00:00:18.390> a

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
cell that I found has been pretty much a

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.450 
cell that I found has been pretty much a
letdown<00:00:18.720> there's<00:00:19.470> been<00:00:19.650> like<00:00:19.770> one<00:00:20.039> amp<00:00:20.310> hour

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
letdown there's been like one amp hour

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.250 
letdown there's been like one amp hour
or<00:00:20.730> something<00:00:20.910> like<00:00:21.000> that<00:00:21.270> but<00:00:21.900> there<00:00:22.230> are

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
or something like that but there are

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.200 
or something like that but there are
quite<00:00:22.529> old<00:00:22.740> now<00:00:23.070> here's<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.029> interesting

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
quite old now here's the interesting

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.480 
quite old now here's the interesting
thing<00:00:24.570> though<00:00:24.720> these<00:00:25.109> are<00:00:25.350> all<00:00:25.529> almost<00:00:25.949> zero

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
thing though these are all almost zero

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.060 
thing though these are all almost zero
volts<00:00:26.939> right<00:00:27.630> but<00:00:27.930> I<00:00:28.080> put<00:00:28.380> them<00:00:28.529> into<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.800> bin

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
volts right but I put them into the bin

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.189 
volts right but I put them into the bin
of<00:00:29.340> just<00:00:29.580> dead<00:00:29.820> batteries<00:00:30.269> at<00:00:30.449> zero<00:00:30.720> volts<00:00:31.080> but

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
of just dead batteries at zero volts but

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.420 
of just dead batteries at zero volts but
then<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.470> occurred<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.710> me<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:32.070> know<00:00:32.219> there

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
then it occurred to me you know there

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
then it occurred to me you know there
she<00:00:32.579> not<00:00:32.730> at<00:00:32.940> zero<00:00:33.300> volts<00:00:33.559> there<00:00:34.559> at<00:00:34.880> 0.128<00:00:35.880> of

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
she not at zero volts there at 0.128 of

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.380 
she not at zero volts there at 0.128 of
a<00:00:36.750> volts<00:00:37.110> so<00:00:37.739> they're<00:00:37.890> extremely<00:00:38.489> low<00:00:38.760> lower

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
a volts so they're extremely low lower

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.060 
a volts so they're extremely low lower
than<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.780> would<00:00:39.960> normally<00:00:39.989> put<00:00:40.469> into<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.710> battery

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
than I would normally put into a battery

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.299 
than I would normally put into a battery
pack<00:00:42.260> now<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.530> said<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:43.950> I'm<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.100> huge

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
pack now that I said that I'm a huge

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.100 
pack now that I said that I'm a huge
hypocrite<00:00:44.789> because<00:00:45.090> my<00:00:45.600> like<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.780> tricycle

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
hypocrite because my like a tricycle

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.840 
hypocrite because my like a tricycle
battery<00:00:46.559> pack<00:00:46.770> half<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.610> made<00:00:47.820> with

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
battery pack half of it is made with

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.880 
battery pack half of it is made with
cells<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.420> were<00:00:48.539> found<00:00:48.780> at<00:00:48.930> zero<00:00:49.289> volts<00:00:49.710> like

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
cells that were found at zero volts like

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.459 
cells that were found at zero volts like
actually<00:00:50.520> zero<00:00:50.910> volts<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:52.170> it's<00:00:52.289> already

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
actually zero volts and it's already

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.709 
actually zero volts and it's already
gotten<00:00:52.649> me<00:00:52.800> over<00:00:53.579> 800<00:00:54.059> miles<00:00:54.239> out<00:00:54.449> here<00:00:54.629> in

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
gotten me over 800 miles out here in

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.920 
gotten me over 800 miles out here in
California<00:00:55.199> so<00:00:55.500> that's<00:00:55.620> pretty<00:00:55.770> good<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:56.930> just

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
California so that's pretty good I just

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.450 
California so that's pretty good I just
probably<00:00:58.199> wouldn't<00:00:58.530> put<00:00:58.559> these<00:00:58.800> into<00:00:59.010> such<00:00:59.430> a

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
probably wouldn't put these into such a

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.819 
probably wouldn't put these into such a
big<00:00:59.820> pack<00:01:00.149> as<00:01:00.449> those<00:01:00.989> ones<00:01:01.230> now<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.680> have

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
big pack as those ones now that I have

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.410 
big pack as those ones now that I have
more<00:01:02.010> lithium<00:01:02.340> cells<00:01:02.579> but<00:01:03.059> they'd<00:01:03.149> be<00:01:03.239> great

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
more lithium cells but they'd be great

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.729 
more lithium cells but they'd be great
for<00:01:03.510> like<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.690> smaller<00:01:03.989> pack<00:01:04.229> just<00:01:04.559> for

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
for like a smaller pack just for

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.109 
for like a smaller pack just for
something<00:01:05.010> just<00:01:05.400> for<00:01:05.549> playing<00:01:05.700> around<00:01:05.909> with

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
something just for playing around with

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.810 
something just for playing around with
but<00:01:06.840> right<00:01:06.960> now<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.170> want<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.590> see<00:01:07.770> how<00:01:08.340> durable

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
but right now I want to see how durable

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.070 
but right now I want to see how durable
is<00:01:09.119> this<00:01:09.510> battery<00:01:09.960> type<00:01:10.950> this<00:01:11.490> brand<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.360> 18

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
is this battery type this brand of 18

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.160 
is this battery type this brand of 18
650<00:01:13.470> sees<00:01:13.950> or<00:01:14.549> CGR<00:01:15.000> HD<00:01:15.270> 650<00:01:15.570> sees<00:01:15.900> because

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
650 sees or CGR HD 650 sees because

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.330 
650 sees or CGR HD 650 sees because
there<00:01:16.350> seems<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.680> be<00:01:16.770> several<00:01:17.070> different

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
there seems to be several different

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.969 
there seems to be several different
variants<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.390> Panasonic<00:01:18.960> brand<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.590> I

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
variants of the Panasonic brand and I

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.090 
variants of the Panasonic brand and I
believe<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.369> these<00:01:20.909> cells<00:01:21.869> are<00:01:22.259> originally

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
believe that these cells are originally

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.030 
believe that these cells are originally
designed<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.640> be<00:01:23.729> 2200<00:01:24.720> million<00:01:25.650> powers<00:01:26.009> of

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
designed to be 2200 million powers of

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.390 
designed to be 2200 million powers of
capacity<00:01:26.360> so<00:01:27.360> first<00:01:28.200> thing<00:01:28.380> not<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.619> do<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:28.979> we

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
capacity so first thing not to do is we

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.069 
capacity so first thing not to do is we
have<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.579> charge<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:29.880> with<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.090> very<00:01:30.360> low<00:01:30.630> amount

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
have to charge it with a very low amount

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.690 
have to charge it with a very low amount
of<00:01:31.170> current<00:01:32.070> turn<00:01:33.060> on<00:01:33.180> our<00:01:33.329> power<00:01:33.810> supply<00:01:34.700> imax

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.240 
of current turn on our power supply imax
b6<00:01:36.409> now<00:01:37.820> the<00:01:38.820> imax<00:01:39.119> b6<00:01:39.180> only<00:01:39.689> goes<00:01:39.840> down<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.259> 0.1

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
b6 now the imax b6 only goes down to 0.1

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.940 
b6 now the imax b6 only goes down to 0.1
of<00:01:41.280> an<00:01:41.460> amp<00:01:41.640> as<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:42.090> can<00:01:42.210> see<00:01:42.329> right<00:01:42.420> there<00:01:42.630> and

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
of an amp as you can see right there and

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.039 
of an amp as you can see right there and
that's<00:01:43.950> only<00:01:44.070> 100<00:01:44.759> milliamps<00:01:45.329> that's<00:01:45.750> still<00:01:46.020> a

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
that's only 100 milliamps that's still a

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.990 
that's only 100 milliamps that's still a
little<00:01:46.229> higher<00:01:46.530> than<00:01:46.920> what<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.490> would<00:01:47.670> put<00:01:47.820> into

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
little higher than what I would put into

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.450 
little higher than what I would put into
these<00:01:48.210> but<00:01:48.810> remember<00:01:49.350> these<00:01:49.770> cells<00:01:50.130> are<00:01:50.369> in

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
these but remember these cells are in

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.330 
these but remember these cells are in
parallel<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.000> it's<00:01:51.299> divided<00:01:51.659> by<00:01:51.750> 3<00:01:52.079> so<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:52.799> if

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
parallel so it's divided by 3 so that if

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.850 
parallel so it's divided by 3 so that if
I<00:01:53.460> charge<00:01:53.759> at<00:01:53.970> 0.1<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:54.869> an<00:01:55.049> amp<00:01:55.290> these<00:01:55.560> each<00:01:55.829> of

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
I charge at 0.1 of an amp these each of

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.490 
I charge at 0.1 of an amp these each of
these<00:01:56.009> will<00:01:56.280> get<00:01:56.430> only<00:01:56.579> point<00:01:57.180> 0<00:01:57.450> 3<00:01:57.540> 3<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:58.380> an

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
these will get only point 0 3 3 of an

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.120 
these will get only point 0 3 3 of an
amp<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:59.119> say<00:02:00.119> let's<00:02:00.420> charge<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.590> see<00:02:01.979> what

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
amp I say let's charge and see what

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:15.490 
amp I say let's charge and see what
happens<00:02:02.460> see<00:02:02.880> if<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.030> blows<00:02:03.149> up<00:02:05.930> short<00:02:06.930> error

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.470 

whoa<00:02:16.160> look<00:02:16.400> at<00:02:16.460> that<00:02:16.520> what's<00:02:17.060> going<00:02:18.340> although

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
whoa look at that what's going although

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.700 
whoa look at that what's going although
I'm<00:02:20.480> not<00:02:20.690> very<00:02:20.750> happy<00:02:21.050> with<00:02:21.260> it<00:02:21.290> going<00:02:21.500> down

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
I'm not very happy with it going down

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.730 
I'm not very happy with it going down
that<00:02:22.010> far<00:02:22.310> that<00:02:22.670> quickly<00:02:23.450> because<00:02:23.900> it<00:02:24.590> was

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
that far that quickly because it was

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.250 
that far that quickly because it was
kind<00:02:24.920> of<00:02:24.950> every<00:02:25.670> time<00:02:25.850> I<00:02:25.970> was<00:02:26.030> tapping<00:02:26.870> it<00:02:27.140> it

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
kind of every time I was tapping it it

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.190 
kind of every time I was tapping it it
would<00:02:27.380> go<00:02:27.500> down<00:02:27.740> really<00:02:27.980> far<00:02:28.340> so<00:02:28.960> these<00:02:29.960> might

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
would go down really far so these might

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.510 
would go down really far so these might
have<00:02:30.350> extremely<00:02:30.710> high<00:02:30.860> disk<00:02:31.280> drive

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
have extremely high disk drive

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.520 
have extremely high disk drive
self-discharge<00:02:31.970> rates<00:02:32.450> now<00:02:33.110> they've<00:02:33.410> gone

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
self-discharge rates now they've gone

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:40.420 
self-discharge rates now they've gone
down<00:02:33.590> so<00:02:33.980> low<00:02:36.850> okay<00:02:37.850> so<00:02:38.050> if<00:02:39.050> these<00:02:39.350> cells<00:02:39.650> don't

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
down so low okay so if these cells don't

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.220 
down so low okay so if these cells don't
have<00:02:40.580> a<00:02:40.700> very<00:02:40.880> high<00:02:41.090> self<00:02:41.570> discharge<00:02:41.810> right

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
have a very high self discharge right

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.930 
have a very high self discharge right
now<00:02:42.350> and<00:02:42.560> if<00:02:42.650> they<00:02:42.860> are<00:02:43.070> working<00:02:43.340> okay<00:02:43.730> I

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
now and if they are working okay I

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.790 
now and if they are working okay I
should<00:02:44.270> be<00:02:44.750> able<00:02:44.810> to<00:02:44.930> turn<00:02:45.050> it<00:02:45.200> off<00:02:45.350> and<00:02:45.620> the

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
should be able to turn it off and the

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.860 
should be able to turn it off and the
number<00:02:46.100> not<00:02:46.460> go<00:02:46.610> down<00:02:46.820> very<00:02:47.240> far<00:02:47.540> after<00:02:47.690> a

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
number not go down very far after a

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.140 
number not go down very far after a
couple<00:02:48.140> seconds<00:02:51.670> it<00:02:52.670> should<00:02:52.850> stabilize

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
couple seconds it should stabilize

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:02.880 
couple seconds it should stabilize
pretty<00:02:53.690> quickly<00:02:53.900> if<00:02:54.590> it's<00:02:54.830> healthy

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.450 

mm-hmm<00:03:05.620> at<00:03:06.620> least<00:03:06.830> you<00:03:06.920> have<00:03:07.040> three<00:03:07.280> even

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.460 
mm-hmm at least you have three even

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.220 
mm-hmm at least you have three even
though<00:03:07.610> now<00:03:08.390> let's<00:03:08.660> try<00:03:08.870> the<00:03:08.930> other<00:03:09.080> one<00:03:11.230> okay

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
though now let's try the other one okay

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:29.890 
though now let's try the other one okay
so<00:03:12.470> let's<00:03:13.010> see<00:03:13.160> how<00:03:13.280> this<00:03:13.430> goes

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.050 

not<00:03:30.530> they're<00:03:30.739> sure<00:03:30.890> about<00:03:31.129> these<00:03:31.370> cells<00:03:31.670> I

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
not they're sure about these cells I

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.520 
not they're sure about these cells I
don't<00:03:32.629> think<00:03:32.750> they're<00:03:32.840> going<00:03:32.959> to<00:03:33.019> handle<00:03:33.319> too

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
don't think they're going to handle too

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.990 
don't think they're going to handle too
well<00:03:34.540> they<00:03:35.540> may<00:03:35.780> have<00:03:35.810> not<00:03:36.080> survived<00:03:36.730> all<00:03:37.730> the

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
well they may have not survived all the

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.630 
well they may have not survived all the
years<00:03:38.239> of<00:03:38.390> use<00:03:38.989> or<00:03:39.319> non-use<00:03:39.590> or<00:03:40.069> whatever<00:03:40.430> life

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
years of use or non-use or whatever life

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.180 
years of use or non-use or whatever life
they've<00:03:40.879> lived<00:03:41.709> now<00:03:42.709> we'll<00:03:42.830> see<00:03:42.980> how<00:03:43.040> this

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
they've lived now we'll see how this

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:57.940 
they've lived now we'll see how this
handles

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.880 

hmm<00:04:01.660> you<00:04:02.660> know<00:04:02.780> wishful<00:04:03.230> thinking

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
hmm you know wishful thinking

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.009 
hmm you know wishful thinking
wants<00:04:04.760> me<00:04:04.819> to<00:04:04.910> think<00:04:05.239> that<00:04:05.330> while<00:04:05.750> they're

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
wants me to think that while they're

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:08.020 
wants me to think that while they're
still<00:04:06.290> below<00:04:06.650> three<00:04:06.980> volts<00:04:07.280> that<00:04:07.459> that's<00:04:07.819> why

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
still below three volts that that's why

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.119 
still below three volts that that's why
they<00:04:08.330> don't<00:04:09.019> keep<00:04:09.290> their<00:04:09.500> charge<00:04:10.040> as<00:04:10.220> much<00:04:10.250> I

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:12.129 
they don't keep their charge as much I

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:15.040 
they don't keep their charge as much I
like<00:04:13.129> this<00:04:13.280> ones<00:04:13.489> huh<00:04:13.879> that's<00:04:14.330> us<00:04:14.630> still<00:04:14.870> going

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
like this ones huh that's us still going

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:23.200 
like this ones huh that's us still going
down<00:04:15.170> there<00:04:15.470> one<00:04:19.000> and<00:04:20.000> that<00:04:20.930> one<00:04:21.079> is<00:04:21.229> too<00:04:22.210> so

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
down there one and that one is too so

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.240 
down there one and that one is too so
yeah<00:04:23.419> I<00:04:23.720> have<00:04:23.960> to<00:04:24.080> say<00:04:24.260> I<00:04:24.560> would<00:04:24.620> never<00:04:24.950> trust

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
yeah I have to say I would never trust

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.400 
yeah I have to say I would never trust
charging<00:04:26.000> those<00:04:26.120> two<00:04:26.300> full<00:04:26.540> because<00:04:27.260> all

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
charging those two full because all

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:28.870 
charging those two full because all
they're<00:04:27.560> gonna<00:04:27.650> do<00:04:27.889> is<00:04:27.919> release<00:04:28.310> their<00:04:28.520> energy

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
they're gonna do is release their energy

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.330 
they're gonna do is release their energy
and<00:04:29.530> best-case<00:04:30.530> scenario<00:04:31.010> they<00:04:31.160> just

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
and best-case scenario they just

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.050 
and best-case scenario they just
releases<00:04:31.700> slowly

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
releases slowly

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.490 
releases slowly
worst<00:04:32.330> case<00:04:32.479> scenario<00:04:32.540> they<00:04:33.169> release<00:04:33.410> the

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
worst case scenario they release the

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.010 
worst case scenario they release the
past<00:04:33.880> so<00:04:34.880> I<00:04:34.910> think<00:04:35.030> right<00:04:35.270> now<00:04:35.360> these<00:04:35.660> are<00:04:35.870> just

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
past so I think right now these are just

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.780 
past so I think right now these are just
be<00:04:36.139> good<00:04:36.350> for<00:04:36.650> having<00:04:37.040> nice<00:04:37.340> little<00:04:37.639> blue

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
be good for having nice little blue

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:43.240 
be good for having nice little blue
cells<00:04:38.090> around<00:04:41.560> well<00:04:42.560> guys<00:04:42.710> I'm<00:04:42.979> sorry<00:04:43.130> for

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
cells around well guys I'm sorry for

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.890 
cells around well guys I'm sorry for
this<00:04:43.490> video<00:04:43.700> being<00:04:43.910> so<00:04:44.150> short<00:04:44.330> I<00:04:44.540> was<00:04:44.630> hoping<00:04:44.810> I

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
this video being so short I was hoping I

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.120 
this video being so short I was hoping I
have<00:04:45.020> some<00:04:45.200> interesting<00:04:45.350> things<00:04:45.740> about<00:04:45.889> these

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
have some interesting things about these
