00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
here in Canada all right okay here's our

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.110 
here in Canada all right okay here's our
steering<00:01:42.480> wheel<00:01:42.600> take<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.260> back<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.380> quarter

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.120 
steering wheel take it back a quarter

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.340 
steering wheel take it back a quarter
now<00:01:45.120> you<00:01:45.180> have<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.600> quarter<00:01:45.900> and<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.110> need<00:01:46.260> to

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
now you have the quarter and you need to

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.950 
now you have the quarter and you need to
reach<00:01:46.560> for<00:01:46.980> the<00:01:47.100> shifter<00:01:47.570> it<00:01:48.570> needs<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.810> be<00:01:48.930> a

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
reach for the shifter it needs to be a

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.650 
reach for the shifter it needs to be a
little<00:01:49.200> bit<00:01:49.380> taller<00:01:49.410> so<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.520> reach<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:51.390> much

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:51.660 
little bit taller so that reach is much

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.930 
little bit taller so that reach is much
closer<00:01:51.960> this<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:52.830> going<00:01:52.980> to

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
closer this is going to

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.930 
closer this is going to
shorten<00:01:55.100> the<00:01:56.100> amount<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.400> time<00:01:56.580> that<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.820> takes

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
shorten the amount of time that it takes

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.160 
shorten the amount of time that it takes
you<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.900> shift<00:01:58.520> the<00:01:59.520> short<00:01:59.760> shifter<00:02:00.170> shortens

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
you to shift the short shifter shortens

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.800 
you to shift the short shifter shortens
up<00:02:01.290> throw<00:02:01.920> all<00:02:01.980> of<00:02:02.010> the<00:02:02.190> shift<00:02:02.480> so<00:02:03.480> the<00:02:03.630> ship

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
up throw all of the shift so the ship

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.100 
up throw all of the shift so the ship
can<00:02:03.990> be<00:02:04.050> quicker<00:02:05.420> the<00:02:06.420> time<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:06.750> takes<00:02:06.870> you<00:02:07.020> to

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
can be quicker the time it takes you to

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.990 
can be quicker the time it takes you to
move<00:02:07.290> in<00:02:07.530> from<00:02:07.800> the<00:02:07.950> steering<00:02:08.160> wheel<00:02:08.430> to<00:02:08.970> the
