didn't really I didn't realize actually
I<00:01:54.960> does<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.200> first<00:01:55.409> time<00:01:55.590> I'm<00:01:55.890> doing<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.369> I

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
I does the first time I'm doing it I

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.100 
I does the first time I'm doing it I
just<00:01:56.460> trying<00:01:56.850> out<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.570> guess<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.990> we

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
just trying out and I guess the we

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.840 
just trying out and I guess the we
actually<00:01:58.439> attracts<00:01:58.740> them<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.219> so<00:01:59.490> I<00:01:59.520> mean

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
actually attracts them to you so I mean

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.639 
actually attracts them to you so I mean
if<00:01:59.939> it's<00:02:00.420> annoying<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:01.259> need<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.439> get<00:02:01.500> them

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
if it's annoying you need to get them

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.469 
if it's annoying you need to get them
close<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:01.979> each<00:02:02.070> other<00:02:02.159> well<00:02:02.610> it's<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.270> should

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
close to each other well it's it should

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.580 
close to each other well it's it should
be<00:02:03.570> kind<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:03.810> easy<00:02:03.960> because<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.439> can<00:02:04.560> just

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
be kind of easy because you can just

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.130 
be kind of easy because you can just
bring<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:06.060> can<00:02:06.240> just<00:02:06.390> put<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.780> wheat<00:02:06.930> in<00:02:07.020> your

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
bring you can just put the wheat in your

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.180 
bring you can just put the wheat in your
hands<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.469> then<00:02:07.590> they<00:02:07.740> should<00:02:07.920> follow<00:02:08.039> you

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
hands and then they should follow you

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.710

anyway<00:02:08.459> guys<00:02:08.580> that's<00:02:08.640> animal<00:02:09.209> breeding<00:02:09.509> it's

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
anyway guys that's animal breeding it's

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.330 
anyway guys that's animal breeding it's
very<00:02:09.899> simple<00:02:10.170> I<00:02:10.440> think<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.860> best<00:02:11.009> thing<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.160> do

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
very simple I think the best thing to do

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.550 
very simple I think the best thing to do
would<00:02:11.580> be<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.760> either<00:02:12.239> make<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.510> farm<00:02:12.870> get<00:02:13.349> so

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
would be to either make a farm get so

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.680 
would be to either make a farm get so
wheat<00:02:13.709> and<00:02:13.920> then<00:02:14.099> do<00:02:14.250> this<00:02:14.430> but<00:02:15.330> I<00:02:15.360> think<00:02:15.450> the

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
wheat and then do this but I think the

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.210 
wheat and then do this but I think the
best<00:02:15.959> way<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.530> absolute<00:02:16.770> best<00:02:16.950> way<00:02:17.069> is<00:02:17.130> to

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
best way the absolute best way is to

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.160 
best way the absolute best way is to
find<00:02:17.489> an<00:02:17.610> NPC<00:02:17.940> village<00:02:18.300> over<00:02:18.569> here<00:02:18.840> I<00:02:18.870> actually

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
find an NPC village over here I actually

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.699 
find an NPC village over here I actually
have<00:02:19.590> I<00:02:20.310> found<00:02:21.300> one<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.660> then<00:02:22.020> I<00:02:22.110> decided<00:02:22.440> to

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
have I found one and then I decided to

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.440 
have I found one and then I decided to
just<00:02:22.920> get<00:02:23.400> all<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.760> weekday<00:02:24.030> or<00:02:24.150> basically

steal all their weights and then i went

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.360 
steal all their weights and then i went
ahead<00:02:27.959> and<00:02:28.080> then<00:02:28.440> just<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:28.980> know<00:02:29.069> do<00:02:29.220> this

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
ahead and then just you know do this

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.100 
ahead and then just you know do this
right<00:02:29.940> click<00:02:29.970> on<00:02:30.180> one<00:02:30.360> he<00:02:30.480> gets<00:02:30.569> hearts<00:02:30.900> i'm<00:02:31.019> a

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
right click on one he gets hearts i'm a

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.360 
right click on one he gets hearts i'm a
fine<00:02:31.260> another<00:02:31.440> one<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:31.860> we<00:02:32.010> can<00:02:32.099> do<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.250> same

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
fine another one and we can do the same

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.390

thing<00:02:32.670> so<00:02:32.819> that's<00:02:33.150> animal<00:02:33.569> breeding<00:02:33.750> guys<00:02:33.930> um

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
thing so that's animal breeding guys um

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.860 
thing so that's animal breeding guys um
pretty<00:02:35.400> simple<00:02:35.790> i<00:02:35.940> think<00:02:36.180> that's<00:02:36.300> really<00:02:36.450> cool

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
pretty simple i think that's really cool

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.270 
pretty simple i think that's really cool
they<00:02:37.050> might<00:02:37.200> change<00:02:37.709> it<00:02:37.890> a<00:02:37.920> little<00:02:37.950> bit<00:02:38.130> the

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
they might change it a little bit the

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.130 
they might change it a little bit the
future<00:02:38.550> and<00:02:38.730> maybe<00:02:39.060> make<00:02:39.360> like<00:02:39.390> little<00:02:39.569> baby

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
future and maybe make like little baby

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.229 
future and maybe make like little baby
ones<00:02:40.440> instead<00:02:40.739> of<00:02:40.830> just<00:02:40.950> like<00:02:41.099> having<00:02:41.849> a<00:02:41.910> full
