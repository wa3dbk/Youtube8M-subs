I<00:03:01.980> mean<00:03:02.980> we're<00:03:03.130> all<00:03:03.280> really<00:03:03.940> close<00:03:04.180> now<00:03:04.570> we<00:03:05.410> do

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
I mean we're all really close now we do

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.610 
I mean we're all really close now we do
well<00:03:06.270> it<00:03:07.270> seems<00:03:07.720> like<00:03:07.810> in<00:03:08.020> our<00:03:08.110> time<00:03:08.290> later<00:03:08.500> on

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
well it seems like in our time later on

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.740

we<00:03:08.860> get<00:03:09.040> a<00:03:09.070> little<00:03:09.220> better<00:03:09.400> you<00:03:09.760> know<00:03:09.880> we'll

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750
