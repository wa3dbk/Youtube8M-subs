00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
exact same thing with both hands so for

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.380 
exact same thing with both hands so for
the<00:00:34.290> example<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.800> song<00:00:35.010> at<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.280> cross<00:00:35.640> the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
the example the song at the cross the

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.880 
the example the song at the cross the
chords<00:00:36.750> ready

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.880 

c-sharp<00:00:42.520> minor<00:00:43.090> now<00:00:43.930> that<00:00:44.110> looks<00:00:44.649> difficult

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
c-sharp minor now that looks difficult

00:00:44.890 --> 00:01:14.390 
c-sharp minor now that looks difficult
and<00:00:45.850> I'll<00:00:46.090> point<00:00:46.390> through<00:00:46.690> it

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.980 

so<00:01:15.400> that<00:01:15.670> looks<00:01:15.850> difficult<00:01:16.090> but<00:01:16.450> again<00:01:16.630> all

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
so that looks difficult but again all

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.840 
so that looks difficult but again all
I'm<00:01:17.110> doing<00:01:17.439> is<00:01:17.560> that<00:01:17.950> he<00:01:18.100> quarters<00:01:18.520> my<00:01:18.670> right

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
forth with that in the same exact notes

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.820 
forth with that in the same exact notes
with<00:01:24.790> the<00:01:24.880> equal<00:01:25.299> to<00:01:25.360> the<00:01:25.450> same<00:01:25.659> now<00:01:26.530> switch<00:01:26.799> to

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
with the equal to the same now switch to

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.350 
with the equal to the same now switch to
a

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.210 

right<00:01:30.260> there<00:01:30.470> then<00:01:30.740> the<00:01:30.830> B<00:01:32.770> c-sharp

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
right there then the B c-sharp

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.920 
right there then the B c-sharp
and<00:01:35.640> always<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.060> have<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.300> Tommy<00:01:36.570> right

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
and always you have that Tommy right

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.450 
and always you have that Tommy right
just<00:01:37.260> like<00:01:37.350> strumming<00:01:37.860> if<00:01:37.950> you've<00:01:38.070> got<00:01:38.280> that

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
just like strumming if you've got that

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.030 
just like strumming if you've got that
timing<00:01:38.730> now<00:01:39.290> people<00:01:40.290> can<00:01:40.470> write<00:01:40.590> they'll

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
timing now people can write they'll

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.470 
timing now people can write they'll
think<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.400> can<00:01:41.520> really<00:01:41.730> play<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.000> piano<00:01:42.300> even

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480 
think you can really play the piano even

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.520 
think you can really play the piano even
though<00:01:42.630> you're<00:01:42.840> just<00:01:42.870> going<00:01:43.170> back<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.350> forth

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
though you're just going back and forth

00:01:43.530 --> 00:02:30.300 
though you're just going back and forth
for<00:01:43.830> the<00:01:43.950> chords

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.800 

so<00:02:31.310> again<00:02:31.670> when<00:02:32.090> you<00:02:32.180> start<00:02:32.390> playing<00:02:32.540> those

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
so again when you start playing those

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.540 
so again when you start playing those
Black<00:02:33.080> Keys<00:02:33.380> different<00:02:33.890> things<00:02:34.040> people<00:02:34.130> think

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
Black Keys different things people think

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.730 
Black Keys different things people think
oh<00:02:34.790> they<00:02:35.090> can<00:02:35.240> really<00:02:35.450> play<00:02:35.690> but<00:02:36.440> it's<00:02:36.590> just

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
oh they can really play but it's just

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.070 
oh they can really play but it's just
learning<00:02:37.220> the<00:02:37.340> simple<00:02:37.670> chords<00:02:38.080> there's

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
learning the simple chords there's

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:45.450 
learning the simple chords there's
there's<00:02:39.800> me<00:02:40.930> there's<00:02:41.930> a<00:02:42.110> name<00:02:43.390> there's<00:02:44.390> a<00:02:44.510> PT

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
there's me there's a name there's a PT

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.880

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.880 
and there's a c-sharp minor' none of
those<00:02:48.980> four<00:02:49.220> things<00:02:50.200> then<00:02:51.200> play<00:02:51.470> it<00:02:51.500> with<00:02:51.710> both

hands

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.149 

so<00:03:11.819> once<00:03:12.299> you<00:03:12.450> learn<00:03:12.719> just<00:03:13.079> those<00:03:13.290> few<00:03:13.620> chords

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
so once you learn just those few chords

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:16.699 
so once you learn just those few chords
you<00:03:15.060> can<00:03:15.090> apply<00:03:15.450> to<00:03:15.510> so<00:03:15.810> many<00:03:15.930> songs<00:03:16.290> as<00:03:16.560> long

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
you can apply to so many songs as long

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:57.240 
you can apply to so many songs as long
as<00:03:16.799> you<00:03:16.890> stay<00:03:17.099> in<00:03:17.280> that<00:03:17.370> key<00:03:17.609> of<00:03:17.730> e<00:03:17.939> so<00:03:18.659> freely
