expected me to go back out at one point

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.050 
expected me to go back out at one point
and<00:01:44.479> then<00:01:44.600> you<00:01:45.229> just<00:01:45.460> think<00:01:46.460> was<00:01:46.550> changed<00:01:46.910> now

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
and then you just think was changed now

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.090 
and then you just think was changed now
it's<00:01:47.240> more<00:01:47.450> of<00:01:47.479> a<00:01:47.600> squad<00:01:47.840> game<00:01:48.050> you<00:01:48.649> guys<00:01:48.830> have

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
it's more of a squad game you guys have

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.310 
it's more of a squad game you guys have
you've<00:01:49.880> got<00:01:50.030> have<00:01:50.210> those<00:01:50.420> senior<00:01:50.960> players

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
you've got have those senior players

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.810 
you've got have those senior players
like<00:01:51.470> they<00:01:51.619> sort<00:01:51.830> of<00:01:51.920> chop<00:01:52.220> and<00:01:52.399> change<00:01:52.550> when

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
like they sort of chop and change when

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.499 
like they sort of chop and change when
when<00:01:53.570> a<00:01:53.600> gaffer<00:01:53.899> works<00:01:54.080> good<00:01:54.320> I<00:01:54.530> think<00:01:55.490> it<00:01:56.330> was

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
when a gaffer works good I think it was

expected<00:03:43.160> even<00:03:44.160> though<00:03:44.250> we've<00:03:44.730> never<00:03:44.940> got

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
again eyes a bit of it was a very lucky

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.100 
again eyes a bit of it was a very lucky
golf<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:03.269> sort<00:04:03.510> of<00:04:03.540> thing<00:04:03.660> about<00:04:03.810> port

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
golf the sort of thing about port

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.750 
golf the sort of thing about port
deflection<00:04:04.680> is<00:04:04.769> it<00:04:04.890> might<00:04:05.040> put<00:04:05.280> him<00:04:05.489> in<00:04:05.670> the

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
deflection is it might put him in the

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.090 
deflection is it might put him in the
face<00:04:06.000> and<00:04:06.780> before<00:04:07.019> he<00:04:07.110> knew<00:04:07.230> it<00:04:07.260> was<00:04:07.860> in<00:04:07.890> the

face and before he knew it was in the

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.580 
face and before he knew it was in the
back<00:04:08.250> of<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.430> net<00:04:08.640> and<00:04:09.510> I<00:04:09.630> thought<00:04:09.840> no<00:04:10.260> I'm<00:04:10.470> not

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
back of the net and I thought no I'm not

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:11.809 
back of the net and I thought no I'm not
touch<00:04:10.800> the<00:04:10.920> ball<00:04:11.069> yet<00:04:11.310> and<00:04:11.430> there's<00:04:11.550> nothing

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
touch the ball yet and there's nothing

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.570 
touch the ball yet and there's nothing
I'm<00:04:11.880> doing<00:04:11.940> about<00:04:12.390> the<00:04:12.510> net<00:04:12.780> so<00:04:13.500> it<00:04:13.890> was<00:04:14.100> yeah

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
I'm doing about the net so it was yeah

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.909 
I'm doing about the net so it was yeah
not<00:04:15.090> a<00:04:15.120> nice<00:04:15.360> feeling<00:04:15.600> but<00:04:15.810> I<00:04:15.930> think<00:04:16.200> when<00:04:16.889> we

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
not a nice feeling but I think when we

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.560 
not a nice feeling but I think when we
sort<00:04:17.250> of<00:04:17.280> epitomizes<00:04:17.549> what<00:04:18.030> we've<00:04:18.269> done<00:04:18.390> this

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
sort of epitomizes what we've done this

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.780 
sort of epitomizes what we've done this
year<00:04:18.739> we've<00:04:19.739> not<00:04:19.919> played<00:04:20.070> well<00:04:20.340> but<00:04:20.640> we've

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
year we've not played well but we've

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.500 
year we've not played well but we've
ground<00:04:21.000> that<00:04:21.150> result<00:04:21.950> in<00:04:22.950> that<00:04:23.520> game<00:04:23.760> and<00:04:24.090> when

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
ground that result in that game and when

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.200 
ground that result in that game and when
we<00:04:24.630> say<00:04:24.840> well<00:04:25.080> we've<00:04:25.530> taken<00:04:26.340> the<00:04:26.669> cleaners<00:04:27.030> but

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
we say well we've taken the cleaners but

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.050 
we say well we've taken the cleaners but
yeah<00:04:27.930> I<00:04:27.960> think<00:04:28.460> that's<00:04:29.460> the<00:04:29.550> sign<00:04:29.760> of<00:04:29.789> a<00:04:29.940> good

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
yeah I think that's the sign of a good

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.580 
yeah I think that's the sign of a good
team<00:04:30.240> everyone<00:04:30.539> always<00:04:30.660> says<00:04:30.930> that<00:04:31.110> if<00:04:31.140> you

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
team everyone always says that if you

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:32.690 
team everyone always says that if you
don't<00:04:31.770> play<00:04:31.979> well<00:04:32.190> but<00:04:32.310> you<00:04:32.400> still<00:04:32.580> get

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
don't play well but you still get

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.010 
don't play well but you still get
results<00:04:33.150> and<00:04:33.240> I<00:04:33.450> think<00:04:33.479> that's<00:04:33.750> what<00:04:33.870> we<00:04:33.930> did

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
results and I think that's what we did

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.680 
results and I think that's what we did
on<00:04:34.169> the<00:04:34.260> go

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
on the go

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.480 
on the go

remedy wasn't it we milled it came on

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.500
