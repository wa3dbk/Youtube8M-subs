00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.750
 at the time of the flowering of the acacia 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.200
 the bees a lot of honey in the 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.540
 hive 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.980
 she works a lot and that's the 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.500
 moment when they more bees so in 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.240
 hives there comes a time when a 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.130
 only rich can no longer contain 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.980
 all these bees then what is 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.990
 happens is the queen goes away with 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.400
 part of bees and here they are 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.410
 hang on a branch 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.120
 meanwhile the other part of the 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.820
 bees will raise a new queen in 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.250
 nourishing 1.9 with royal jelly 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.829
 it will form a queen who will replace 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.530
 the other and our old queen well 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.090
 here it is in his tree and it is necessary 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.890
 that they find housing for 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.510
 settle down to lay his eggs and 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.180
 that powerful bees rest their 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.160
 honey and philippe and other adjustments 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.870
 to find them a hotel room in 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.899
 an install an empty hive with already 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.399
 well- built spokes with wax it 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.480
 will go get them up there for them 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.899
 put in the hotel room in 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.899
 question 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.230
 it is delicate we must not lose the 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.930
 queen she is there in the middle we do not know 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.310
 too where so every little branch on 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.380
 which are bees philippe 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:29.080
 lhez picks up tricky - he'll go 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:30.820
 pose on the road down the bees 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.810
 are just hanging on to each 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.640
 others by their paws 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.870
 there is not a central branch it is 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.360
 just a little branch in water and the 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:02:01.810
 other bees are agglutinated by 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:02:03.550
 their legs it must weigh 25 kg 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.820
 near a swarm like that two hundred thousand 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.820
 bees 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:18.240
 she puts the breasts in front and on the 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.100
 hive we will see if they like it if 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:28.050
 immediately the bees rushes 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:29.400
 in the hive the church of in once 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.310
 that the queen will be in the hive all the 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.870
 world is going to go there is there even that beats 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.060
 the call down you remind me that wants 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.190
 to say remove the abdomen and not aids 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.500
 very quickly and it sends the smell of 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.800
 queen and hive 800 meters to the 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.810
 round

 sadi has all the bees that would have 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.920
 not yet found the hive in 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.600
 which is the queen quickly fast 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.340
 came there it's good there find a 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:55.560
 housing there is even that beats the reminder 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.900
 on philippe which is a big sign 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.850
 of trust on his arm the abbots get 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.850
 are put in saying but here we are not 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.120

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.120
 hive 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.000

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.950
 bees on the hand of udc 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.170
 the bees recognize philippe 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.910
 know modders they trust 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.230
 in him 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.700
 one or two bees go on the hand of 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.140
 the udc but they have not yet 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.980
