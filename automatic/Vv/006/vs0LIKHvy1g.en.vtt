 Hey folks 

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.240
 this video is the first 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.219
 how to add the effect due the material is indemnify commented he 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:14.509
 we do the light effects more or less so we will not get as 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:16.759
 A razia is going to be deep in 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:19.060
 enough 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.880
 let's go then 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.880
 first I will create a base 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.449
 comment here 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.460
 I'll create here 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.540
 that the cylinder 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.540
 This beautiful here is going to be some 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.470
 how to model 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.600
 a perfect body tinga 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.600
 that objective of this video to god and to live saw 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.960
 the effect of the river right button made 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.440
 teaches six esteem 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.440
 is that studies 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.750
 another study 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.750
 I'm going to move down. 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.410
 get back in front here 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.160
 but how's the bar? 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.160
 Decrease a little here just to find a way 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.270
 a little bag here 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.340
 yes, it's over 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.530
 they will prepare 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.890
 the materials 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.850
 toasted editors mm 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.850
 hitachi 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.870
 let's create here 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.870
 mindlin that will be ours 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.100
 and now we're going to create 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.390
 the material 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.040
 I doubt mattel of fear 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.770
 up here and attacking the victim and killing that would be hostile Mayan 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.259
 we click clicks ensures it's taken by taking the damn album that I created 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.339
 team entered innocents 

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:12.669
 hence materials come here 

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:14.549
 domenicalli 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:17.549
 immaterial dialectic and this from here 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.389
 that such a dubious effect 

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:22.459
 then vialetto material 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.459
 do not click it, we'll race here 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:31.779
 put it as life and you can change the color later if you want 

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:36.069
 and transparent but what in a video half found my red and everything does 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.829
 to change 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:41.969
 entitled to the following ground matter 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:44.969
 right click or sign material exists 

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:50.849
 I'll have it energized. 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:54.260
 nothing showed up Mayan port software will change commented he 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.489
 I'll try 

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:05.399
 he has to see what made them lose sets 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.489
 let's set production quality 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:14.199
 and nor directive rating 

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:17.199
 here concerned that they join the Celtics 

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:22.449
 How do you improve it a bit? 

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:33.249
 celtics is the mayor of lighting 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.219
 so we're going to add to it badly now 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:41.119
 and will issue 

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:42.739
 we focused on what would be crises 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:44.799
 light effects 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.359
 when does it pass 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:47.789
 by the glass 

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:48.959
 so come on 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.289
 critical 

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:52.889
 quiet 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:55.449
 point and art 

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:57.729
 Julius said awlaki 

00:03:57.729 --> 00:04:01.579
 the tightening up here 11 awaits for me it gets more or less how it's going to stay 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:03.889
 mansion 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:06.889
 I think it's over 

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:10.559
 if it's a network one now 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:18.739
 will get this reflection very big idols here on the floor so here goes 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.719
 disrupt infection 

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:25.029
 so here white picker I'll explain you the specular imitate 

00:04:25.559 --> 00:04:27.750
 it will only light 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.139
 but it will not appear 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:31.900
 in floor 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.900
 this reflection of the 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:40.370
 done that 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.699
 I'm going to say down here we still do not maldi 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:46.789
 and enables me to 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:49.330
 issued for points 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.219
 in the world the visa network 

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:55.369
 limit the photo orbital values ​​according to the size of the object 

00:04:57.559 --> 00:05:00.559
 and it works 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.900
 then that tarr emitting too much 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:09.449
 so I'll set up here a sportsman 2 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:11.330
 The higher this number here 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:12.749
 weaker 

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:15.749
 will be made of focus that I will put 3 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.870
 already got much better 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.479
 to press as many as we can forget 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:34.520
 and each one 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.939
 with photo on 

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:39.939
 now we're only going to improve this scene a little bit 

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:42.939
 Judite of all the Italy that I am going 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:46.960
 the osasuna picker 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.039
 even the end 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:51.039
 he gets better - I'm going to settle down here 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.360
 demos and other 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.560
 Who Politicians Kitchenette in 7 She Returns Everything 

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:01.129
 would not be a defeat down here 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.960
 their goal 

00:06:07.119 --> 00:06:10.119
 this death 

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:13.729
 here is a property 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:17.639
 we can modify this world three divisions mococa to stay a knit more 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:19.759
 patients and supertaca 

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:21.469
 but so many 

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:24.469
 but it will have a very nice effect 

00:06:25.499 --> 00:06:28.499
 the change that the vision of them no action 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.830
 no text 

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:54.749
 ready 

00:06:54.749 --> 00:06:56.059
 nothing difficult 

00:06:56.059 --> 00:06:57.109
 That's it for now.
