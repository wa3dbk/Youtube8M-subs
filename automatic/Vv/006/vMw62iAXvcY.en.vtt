00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
that we're using here so making the

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.390 
that we're using here so making the
settings<00:00:19.230> shouldn't<00:00:19.500> be<00:00:19.590> too<00:00:19.770> hard<00:00:19.800> however

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
settings shouldn't be too hard however

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
but let's go ahead and set that up so

that let's open up settings dot PHP and
the<00:00:40.469> views<00:00:40.739> folder<00:00:42.140> because<00:00:43.140> since<00:00:43.559> the

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
the views folder because since the

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.940 
the views folder because since the
settings<00:00:44.160> are<00:00:44.340> really<00:00:44.610> just<00:00:44.789> single<00:00:45.149> value<00:00:45.950> we

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
settings are really just single value we

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.889 
settings are really just single value we
take<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.190> look<00:00:47.370> at<00:00:47.550> PHP<00:00:48.270> myadmin

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
take a look at PHP myadmin

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.770 
take a look at PHP myadmin
you<00:00:49.289> don't<00:00:49.710> remember<00:00:53.090> we<00:00:54.090> don't<00:00:54.239> really<00:00:54.510> need

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
you don't remember we don't really need

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.470 
you don't remember we don't really need
to<00:00:55.020> generate<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.829> big<00:00:56.070> list<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.579> all<00:00:57.329> the

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
to generate a big list of all the

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.209 
to generate a big list of all the
settings<00:00:57.840> one<00:00:58.469> because<00:00:58.829> we're<00:00:59.010> probably

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
settings one because we're probably

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.979 
settings one because we're probably
gonna<00:00:59.399> have<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.550> lot<00:00:59.850> of<00:00:59.879> them<00:01:00.120> at<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.780> end<00:01:00.899> of

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
gonna have a lot of them at the end of

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.080 
gonna have a lot of them at the end of
the<00:01:01.079> day<00:01:01.760> and<00:01:04.129> you<00:01:05.129> know<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.369> have<00:01:05.670> this<00:01:05.820> giant

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
the day and you know I have this giant

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.910 
the day and you know I have this giant
list<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.810> scroll<00:01:07.110> through<00:01:07.140> just<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.560> change<00:01:07.770> a

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
list to scroll through just to change a

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.109 
list to scroll through just to change a
quick<00:01:08.130> value<00:01:09.229> so<00:01:10.229> rather<00:01:10.860> than<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.369> let's<00:01:11.939> go

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
quick value so rather than that let's go

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.840 
quick value so rather than that let's go
ahead<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.510> actually<00:01:13.100> let's<00:01:14.100> spit<00:01:14.430> out<00:01:14.460> a

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
ahead and actually let's spit out a

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.469 
ahead and actually let's spit out a
bunch<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.330> forms<00:01:16.490> with<00:01:17.490> like<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.759> Save<00:01:18.450> button

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
bunch of forms with like a Save button

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.630 
bunch of forms with like a Save button
next<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.439> each<00:01:19.500> one<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.770> them<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.430> we<00:01:20.520> can

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
next to each one of them so that we can

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.890 
next to each one of them so that we can
actually<00:01:20.790> update<00:01:22.189> kind<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.250> on<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.490> fly<00:01:23.900> so

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
actually update kind of on the fly so

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.890 
actually update kind of on the fly so
we'll<00:01:25.049> go<00:01:25.110> back<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.409> opt<00:01:25.530> Ana<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.210> go<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.270> users

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
we'll go back to opt Ana and go to users

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.749 
we'll go back to opt Ana and go to users

by<00:02:08.810> ID<00:02:10.300> which<00:02:11.300> is<00:02:11.450> really<00:02:11.720> the<00:02:11.870> default<00:02:12.290> way<00:02:12.470> to

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
by ID which is really the default way to

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.839 
by ID which is really the default way to
do<00:02:12.769> it<00:02:12.890> but<00:02:13.129> we'll<00:02:13.310> just<00:02:13.459> go<00:02:13.550> ahead<00:02:13.610> and<00:02:13.760> put

get this list equals out of here so we

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.100 
get this list equals out of here so we

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.250 

and<00:02:37.800> we're<00:02:38.800> actually<00:02:39.370> not<00:02:39.940> creating<00:02:40.629> a<00:02:40.780> list

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
and we're actually not creating a list

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.100 
and we're actually not creating a list
as<00:02:41.920> much<00:02:42.220> as<00:02:42.370> we're<00:02:42.610> actually<00:02:42.760> creating<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:46.930> I

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
as much as we're actually creating and I

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.809 
as much as we're actually creating and I
so<00:02:47.170> we'll<00:02:47.349> keep<00:02:47.530> that<00:02:47.590> as<00:02:47.769> is<00:02:48.159> what<00:02:48.610> we're

so we'll keep that as is what we're

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:50.339 
so we'll keep that as is what we're
gonna<00:02:48.940> do<00:02:49.150> different<00:02:49.599> in<00:02:49.690> here<00:02:49.959> is<00:02:50.140> we're

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
gonna do different in here is we're

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.390 
gonna do different in here is we're
actually<00:02:50.530> going<00:02:50.830> to<00:02:50.920> create<00:02:51.280> a<00:02:51.959> form<00:02:53.400> each

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
actually going to create a form each

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.140 
actually going to create a form each
time<00:02:54.849> this<00:02:55.120> goes<00:02:56.310> go<00:02:57.310> ahead<00:02:57.610> and<00:02:57.730> move<00:02:57.849> this

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
time this goes go ahead and move this

time this goes go ahead and move this
closing<00:02:59.019> PHP<00:02:59.620> up<00:03:00.010> here<00:03:01.830> and<00:03:02.879> let's<00:03:03.879> see<00:03:06.780> we're

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
closing PHP up here and let's see we're

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.699 
closing PHP up here and let's see we're
gonna<00:03:07.900> do<00:03:08.140> an<00:03:08.260> inline<00:03:08.739> form<00:03:09.129> this<00:03:09.340> time<00:03:10.709> so

gonna do an inline form this time so

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.289 
gonna do an inline form this time so
let's<00:03:11.829> take<00:03:11.980> a<00:03:12.010> look<00:03:12.190> at<00:03:12.310> the<00:03:12.459> difference<00:03:13.209> here

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
let's take a look at the difference here

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.569 
let's take a look at the difference here
let's<00:03:13.829> go<00:03:14.829> over<00:03:14.860> to<00:03:15.160> you

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
let's go over to you

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:21.780 
let's go over to you
bootstrap<00:03:17.160> and<00:03:18.160> go<00:03:19.120> scroll<00:03:19.540> up<00:03:19.750> here<00:03:20.609> click<00:03:21.609> on

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
bootstrap and go scroll up here click on

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:29.009 
bootstrap and go scroll up here click on
CSS<00:03:23.849> click<00:03:24.849> on<00:03:25.030> the<00:03:25.120> forms<00:03:26.459> and<00:03:28.019> underneath

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
CSS click on the forms and underneath

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:33.330 
CSS click on the forms and underneath
basic<00:03:29.530> example<00:03:30.040> is<00:03:30.250> inline<00:03:30.760> form<00:03:32.129> what's<00:03:33.129> nice

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
basic example is inline form what's nice

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.369 
basic example is inline form what's nice
is<00:03:33.670> it<00:03:34.030> looks<00:03:34.239> like<00:03:34.450> all<00:03:34.660> we<00:03:34.780> really<00:03:35.109> need<00:03:35.349> to

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:35.379 
is it looks like all we really need to

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:38.009 
is it looks like all we really need to
do<00:03:35.620> is<00:03:35.920> make<00:03:36.760> sure<00:03:36.790> that<00:03:37.209> the<00:03:37.450> form<00:03:37.780> has<00:03:37.840> a

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
do is make sure that the form has a

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.759 
do is make sure that the form has a
class<00:03:38.319> of<00:03:38.620> form<00:03:39.040> -<00:03:39.310> inline<00:03:40.410> so<00:03:41.410> that's<00:03:41.590> pretty

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
class of form - inline so that's pretty

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.530 
class of form - inline so that's pretty
cool<00:03:42.010> let's<00:03:42.760> go<00:03:42.910> ahead<00:03:42.970> and<00:03:43.150> go<00:03:43.209> back<00:03:43.329> to<00:03:43.480> up

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
cool let's go ahead and go back to up

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.640 
cool let's go ahead and go back to up
Tanna<00:03:43.870> and<00:03:44.680> our<00:03:44.799> settings<00:03:45.190> page<00:03:46.530> let's<00:03:47.530> go

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
Tanna and our settings page let's go

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.539 
Tanna and our settings page let's go
ahead<00:03:47.739> and<00:03:47.919> cut<00:03:48.160> this<00:03:48.340> whole<00:03:48.579> form<00:03:49.000> out<00:03:50.549> and

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
ahead and cut this whole form out and

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:56.039 
ahead and cut this whole form out and
we'll<00:03:52.299> paste<00:03:52.599> it<00:03:52.840> in<00:03:52.959> the<00:03:53.109> while<00:03:53.290> loop<00:03:54.989> now<00:03:55.989> we

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
we'll paste it in the while loop now we

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.729 
we'll paste it in the while loop now we
definitely<00:03:56.349> don't<00:03:56.799> need<00:03:57.010> all<00:03:57.280> these<00:03:57.519> options

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
definitely don't need all these options

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:04.440 
definitely don't need all these options
tap<00:03:59.739> this<00:03:59.919> out

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.550 

let's<00:04:04.960> take<00:04:05.110> a<00:04:05.140> look<00:04:05.350> at<00:04:05.470> PHP<00:04:05.860> myadmin<00:04:06.010> again

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
let's take a look at PHP myadmin again

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:16.380 
let's take a look at PHP myadmin again
we<00:04:08.560> need<00:04:08.680> the<00:04:08.800> ID<00:04:09.480> label<00:04:11.100> and<00:04:12.240> value<00:04:13.240> so<00:04:15.390> so

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.390 
we need the ID label and value so so

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.720 
we need the ID label and value so so
let's<00:04:16.660> come<00:04:16.870> in<00:04:17.019> here<00:04:17.049> and<00:04:17.560> the<00:04:17.859> first<00:04:18.280> one<00:04:18.400> is

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
let's come in here and the first one is

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:27.570 
let's come in here and the first one is
going<00:04:18.910> to<00:04:19.000> be<00:04:19.150> ID<00:04:25.740> so<00:04:26.740> we'll<00:04:26.890> change<00:04:27.100> all<00:04:27.370> these

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
going to be ID so we'll change all these

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.550 
going to be ID so we'll change all these
should<00:04:28.330> be<00:04:28.360> getting<00:04:28.720> pretty<00:04:28.900> used<00:04:28.960> to<00:04:29.200> this<00:04:29.350> by

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
should be getting pretty used to this by

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.670 
should be getting pretty used to this by
now<00:04:30.720> and<00:04:32.850> placeholder<00:04:33.850> just<00:04:34.350> put<00:04:35.350> in<00:04:35.470> the<00:04:35.530> word

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
now and placeholder just put in the word

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.420 
now and placeholder just put in the word
ID<00:04:36.419> and<00:04:37.419> let's<00:04:37.960> do<00:04:38.230> a<00:04:38.260> dash<00:04:38.590> and<00:04:38.830> name<00:04:39.040> just<00:04:39.370> to

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
ID and let's do a dash and name just to

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.340 
ID and let's do a dash and name just to
verify<00:04:39.880> that<00:04:39.910> we're<00:04:40.180> not<00:04:40.330> using<00:04:40.570> numeric

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
verify that we're not using numeric

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:49.130 
verify that we're not using numeric
values<00:04:41.770> here<00:04:43.440> and<00:04:44.440> let's<00:04:44.710> change<00:04:45.010> open<00:04:45.790> to<00:04:46.180> ID

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.490 

now<00:04:50.140> we<00:04:50.200> need<00:04:50.620> our<00:04:51.040> label<00:04:51.840> so<00:04:52.840> we'll<00:04:53.260> just<00:04:53.380> go

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
now we need our label so we'll just go

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.220 
now we need our label so we'll just go
ahead<00:04:53.530> and<00:04:53.800> use<00:04:54.010> this<00:04:54.310> last<00:04:55.060> name<00:04:55.450> here<00:04:55.780> and

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
ahead and use this last name here and

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:06.570 
ahead and use this last name here and
whether<00:04:56.440> you<00:04:56.560> label<00:04:59.280> label

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:16.480 

label<00:05:11.620> and<00:05:13.180> label<00:05:14.410> and<00:05:15.410> the<00:05:15.740> last<00:05:15.950> one<00:05:16.160> we<00:05:16.280> need

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
label and label and the last one we need

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.710 
label and label and the last one we need
is<00:05:16.760> value<00:05:17.950> so<00:05:18.950> let's<00:05:19.100> go<00:05:19.310> ahead<00:05:19.430> and<00:05:19.610> do<00:05:20.600> the

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
is value so let's go ahead and do the

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:40.460 
is value so let's go ahead and do the
same<00:05:20.990> down<00:05:21.230> here<00:05:21.290> for<00:05:21.860> value

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.440 

and<00:05:41.100> now<00:05:41.550> we<00:05:41.610> can<00:05:41.760> get<00:05:41.910> rid<00:05:42.000> of<00:05:42.060> the<00:05:42.150> rest<00:05:42.330> of

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450 
and now we can get rid of the rest of

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:46.820 
and now we can get rid of the rest of
these<00:05:43.700> so<00:05:44.700> get<00:05:45.060> rid<00:05:45.150> of<00:05:45.300> status<00:05:45.840> password<00:05:46.500> and

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
these so get rid of status password and

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:57.890 
these so get rid of status password and
verify<00:05:46.880> password<00:05:52.820> and<00:05:53.820> let's<00:05:54.780> see<00:05:56.900> that's

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 
verify password and let's see that's

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:04.690 
verify password and let's see that's
fine<00:05:59.930> actually<00:06:00.930> no<00:06:01.260> that's<00:06:01.380> not<00:06:01.590> fine<00:06:01.890> we<00:06:02.370> want
