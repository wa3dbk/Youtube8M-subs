back and let's see how this one plays

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.249 
back and let's see how this one plays
out<00:01:20.580> this<00:01:20.970> was<00:01:21.150> typically<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.659> really<00:01:22.110> bad

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
out this was typically a really bad

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.679 
out this was typically a really bad
matchup<00:01:22.470> for<00:01:22.650> Ryu<00:01:23.070> when<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:23.790> was<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.150> really<00:01:24.540> bad

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
matchup for Ryu when it was a really bad

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.100 
matchup for Ryu when it was a really bad
matchup<00:01:24.990> I'm<00:01:25.290> not<00:01:25.439> sure<00:01:25.650> how<00:01:25.799> its<00:01:25.950> develop<00:01:27.110> the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
matchup I'm not sure how its develop the

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.200 
matchup I'm not sure how its develop the
fierce<00:01:28.380> defeat<00:01:28.829> think<00:01:29.220> probably<00:01:29.939> makes<00:01:30.090> a

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
fierce defeat think probably makes a

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.850 
fierce defeat think probably makes a
little<00:01:30.360> better<00:01:30.630> for<00:01:30.689> him<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.140> just<00:01:31.380> all<00:01:31.560> the

on<00:02:06.130> this<00:02:06.220> tight-knit<00:02:06.430> character<00:02:06.940> I'm

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
on this tight-knit character I'm

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.090 
on this tight-knit character I'm
actually<00:02:08.170> nobody<00:02:08.950> call<00:02:10.650> and<00:02:11.650> this<00:02:11.740> is<00:02:11.800> whether

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
actually nobody call and this is whether

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.740 
actually nobody call and this is whether
things<00:02:12.340> now<00:02:12.610> about<00:02:12.940> young<00:02:13.240> it<00:02:13.420> wasn't

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
things now about young it wasn't

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.360 
things now about young it wasn't
necessarily<00:02:14.170> true<00:02:14.500> in<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.740> past<00:02:14.950> is<00:02:15.130> that<00:02:15.280> he

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
necessarily true in the past is that he

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.890 
necessarily true in the past is that he
just<00:02:15.400> does<00:02:15.730> not<00:02:15.880> win<00:02:16.150> matches<00:02:16.390> of<00:02:16.630> attrition

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
just does not win matches of attrition

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.750 
just does not win matches of attrition
anymore<00:02:17.380> so<00:02:17.770> if<00:02:17.860> you're<00:02:17.980> scrapping<00:02:18.550> it<00:02:18.640> out

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
anymore so if you're scrapping it out

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.310 
anymore so if you're scrapping it out
with<00:02:18.910> a<00:02:18.970> player<00:02:19.180> like<00:02:19.210> the<00:02:19.570> cow<00:02:19.750> you<00:02:19.990> guys<00:02:20.170> have

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
with a player like the cow you guys have

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.630 
with a player like the cow you guys have
just<00:02:20.350> hate<00:02:20.590> each<00:02:20.740> other<00:02:20.980> yeah<00:02:21.190> you're<00:02:21.520> not

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
just hate each other yeah you're not

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
just hate each other yeah you're not
gonna<00:02:21.790> come<00:02:22.030> out<00:02:22.090> on<00:02:22.270> top

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
gonna come out on top

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.720 
gonna come out on top
yeah<00:02:22.810> yeah<00:02:23.380> they're<00:02:23.860> gonna<00:02:23.980> be<00:02:24.160> out<00:02:24.280> damaging

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
yeah yeah they're gonna be out damaging

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.730 
yeah yeah they're gonna be out damaging
right<00:02:25.180> both<00:02:25.930> characters<00:02:26.380> from<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.560> game<00:02:26.590> to

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
right both characters from the game to

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.380 
right both characters from the game to
now<00:02:27.040> I<00:02:27.070> mean<00:02:27.310> look<00:02:27.430> at<00:02:27.520> that<00:02:27.700> that's<00:02:27.910> weaker

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
now I mean look at that that's weaker

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.850 
now I mean look at that that's weaker
damage<00:02:28.870> compared<00:02:29.200> to<00:02:29.260> what<00:02:29.380> he<00:02:29.440> used<00:02:29.620> to<00:02:29.710> do

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
damage compared to what he used to do

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.240 
damage compared to what he used to do
for<00:02:30.070> sure<00:02:30.870> so<00:02:31.870> has<00:02:32.050> frame<00:02:32.380> advantage<00:02:32.890> yeah<00:02:33.220> I

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
for sure so has frame advantage yeah I

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.710 
for sure so has frame advantage yeah I
think<00:02:33.400> the<00:02:33.610> way<00:02:33.640> he<00:02:33.760> set<00:02:34.150> it<00:02:34.270> up<00:02:34.330> right<00:02:34.510> there

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
think the way he set it up right there

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.050 
think the way he set it up right there
it<00:02:34.810> definitely<00:02:34.930> dies<00:02:35.400> because<00:02:36.400> its<00:02:36.670> finest

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
it definitely dies because its finest

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.080 
it definitely dies because its finest
one<00:02:37.720> or<00:02:38.050> two<00:02:38.410> now<00:02:38.650> but<00:02:39.340> when<00:02:39.550> you<00:02:39.640> do<00:02:39.730> it<00:02:39.820> easy

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
one or two now but when you do it easy

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.820 
one or two now but when you do it easy
like<00:02:40.390> that<00:02:40.600> it<00:02:40.810> does<00:02:40.990> have<00:02:41.140> active<00:02:41.470> frames<00:02:41.680> in

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
like that it does have active frames in

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.880 
like that it does have active frames in
the<00:02:41.890> last<00:02:42.070> row<00:02:42.250> so<00:02:42.280> you<00:02:42.520> bring<00:02:42.970> in<00:02:43.150> is<00:02:43.180> like<00:02:43.560> +10

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.070 

Cosmo<00:02:47.730> go<00:02:47.880> looking<00:02:48.150> a<00:02:48.210> little<00:02:48.330> oh<00:02:48.540> he<00:02:48.780> drops

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
Cosmo go looking a little oh he drops

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.770 
Cosmo go looking a little oh he drops
the<00:02:49.380> uppercut<00:02:49.920> he<00:02:50.490> could<00:02:50.520> uh<00:02:50.700> f-80c<00:02:51.480> altar

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
the uppercut he could uh f-80c altar

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.990 
the uppercut he could uh f-80c altar
right<00:02:51.990> there<00:02:52.170> yeah<00:02:52.440> this<00:02:53.430> didn't<00:02:53.790> go<00:02:53.910> away

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000
