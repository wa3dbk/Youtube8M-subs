so now that you've decided to look into
some<00:00:11.920> means<00:00:12.219> of<00:00:12.519> going<00:00:12.670> pesticide<00:00:13.420> free<00:00:13.959> in

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:14.170 
some means of going pesticide free in

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.310 
some means of going pesticide free in
your<00:00:14.200> garden<00:00:14.769> one<00:00:15.610> method<00:00:16.090> is<00:00:16.660> called

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:17.320 
your garden one method is called

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.690 
your garden one method is called
companion<00:00:18.160> planting<00:00:18.849> and<00:00:19.090> it's<00:00:19.990> a<00:00:20.080> way<00:00:20.259> that

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:20.700 
companion planting and it's a way that

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.390 
companion planting and it's a way that
plants<00:00:21.700> can<00:00:22.029> interact<00:00:22.480> with<00:00:23.079> each<00:00:23.590> other<00:00:23.800> by

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:24.400 
plants can interact with each other by

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.240 
plants can interact with each other by
providing<00:00:24.939> benefits<00:00:25.570> to<00:00:25.720> the<00:00:26.439> soil<00:00:26.919> that

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.250 
providing benefits to the soil that

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.729 
providing benefits to the soil that
they're<00:00:27.430> in<00:00:27.840> sharing<00:00:28.840> nutrients<00:00:29.500> so<00:00:29.680> you

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:29.739 
they're in sharing nutrients so you

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:32.310 
they're in sharing nutrients so you
might<00:00:29.980> put<00:00:30.430> shallow<00:00:31.239> rooted<00:00:31.630> plants<00:00:32.110> near

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
might put shallow rooted plants near

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.670 
might put shallow rooted plants near
deep<00:00:32.710> rooted<00:00:33.130> plants<00:00:33.579> for<00:00:33.820> example<00:00:34.680> it's

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
deep rooted plants for example it's

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.350 
deep rooted plants for example it's
believed<00:00:36.100> that<00:00:36.309> it<00:00:36.460> actually<00:00:36.640> makes<00:00:37.059> some

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
believed that it actually makes some

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.780 
believed that it actually makes some
crop<00:00:38.290> species<00:00:38.800> when<00:00:39.219> they're<00:00:39.370> planted<00:00:39.700> next

they<00:00:42.879> also<00:00:43.030> enhance<00:00:43.300> soil<00:00:43.839> minerals<00:00:44.350> and

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
they also enhance soil minerals and

they also enhance soil minerals and
nutrients<00:00:45.670> and<00:00:45.969> attract<00:00:46.749> beneficial<00:00:47.170> insects
