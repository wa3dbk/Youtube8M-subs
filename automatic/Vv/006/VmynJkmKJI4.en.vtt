well I mean I know why I didn't need it
because<00:05:14.100> i<00:05:14.370> had<00:05:14.610> my<00:05:14.850> thirty<00:05:15.030> dollar<00:05:15.240> purchase

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
because i had my thirty dollar purchase

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.550 
because i had my thirty dollar purchase
so<00:05:16.050> that<00:05:16.200> was<00:05:16.320> the<00:05:16.410> last<00:05:16.590> hope<00:05:16.830> that<00:05:17.010> I<00:05:17.100> got<00:05:17.330> um

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
so that was the last hope that I got um

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.780 
so that was the last hope that I got um
yeah<00:05:19.560> and<00:05:19.740> then<00:05:19.860> I<00:05:19.890> used<00:05:20.100> a<00:05:20.220> ten<00:05:20.400> dollar<00:05:20.520> off

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:20.790 
yeah and then I used a ten dollar off

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.880 
yeah and then I used a ten dollar off
survey<00:05:21.270> coupon<00:05:21.330> so<00:05:21.960> my<00:05:22.080> total<00:05:22.140> ended<00:05:22.590> up<00:05:22.680> being

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:22.890 
survey coupon so my total ended up being
