00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
maybe she's going to become one of the

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.720 
maybe she's going to become one of the
arbiters<00:02:30.960> that<00:02:31.230> judge<00:02:31.440> people<00:02:31.860> or<00:02:32.190> if<00:02:32.520> this<00:02:32.670> is

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
arbiters that judge people or if this is

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.220 
arbiters that judge people or if this is
going<00:02:33.060> to<00:02:33.150> be<00:02:33.240> like<00:02:33.390> focused<00:02:33.720> on<00:02:33.840> different

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
going to be like focused on different

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.050 
going to be like focused on different
people<00:02:34.440> coming<00:02:35.010> there<00:02:35.190> every<00:02:35.550> single<00:02:35.880> time

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
people coming there every single time

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.240 
people coming there every single time
and<00:02:36.090> getting<00:02:36.360> judged<00:02:36.690> it's<00:02:37.170> probably<00:02:38.010> going

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
and getting judged it's probably going

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.890 
and getting judged it's probably going
to<00:02:38.340> be<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.460> mixture<00:02:38.760> of<00:02:38.850> both<00:02:38.970> which<00:02:39.480> is<00:02:39.510> really

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
to be a mixture of both which is really

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.820 
to be a mixture of both which is really
cool<00:02:40.080> I<00:02:40.320> like<00:02:41.070> the<00:02:41.310> fact<00:02:41.580> that<00:02:42.020> the<00:02:43.020> judgments

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
cool I like the fact that the judgments

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.010 
cool I like the fact that the judgments
aren't<00:02:44.280> absolute<00:02:44.820> the<00:02:45.000> judgments<00:02:45.660> aren't

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
aren't absolute the judgments aren't

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.200 
aren't absolute the judgments aren't
always<00:02:46.140> right<00:02:46.590> just<00:02:46.950> like<00:02:47.130> in<00:02:47.310> real<00:02:47.490> life<00:02:47.700> you

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
always right just like in real life you

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.390 
always right just like in real life you
know<00:02:48.330> a<00:02:48.570> judge<00:02:49.110> might<00:02:49.350> sentence<00:02:49.770> someone<00:02:50.220> to

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400

they haven't committed a crime or

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.930 
they haven't committed a crime or
sometimes<00:02:55.410> people<00:02:55.500> get<00:02:55.860> ruled<00:02:56.190> unfairly

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
sometimes people get ruled unfairly

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.160 
a little weird though because like his
mouth<00:03:49.290> is<00:03:49.650> drawn<00:03:49.950> a<00:03:49.980> little<00:03:50.280> low<00:03:50.550> as<00:03:50.850> are<00:03:51.450> some

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
mouth is drawn a little low as are some

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.480 
mouth is drawn a little low as are some
of<00:03:52.260> the<00:03:52.380> other<00:03:52.560> characters<00:03:53.070> in<00:03:53.370> the<00:03:53.460> show

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
of the other characters in the show

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.700 
of the other characters in the show
which<00:03:53.850> I<00:03:54.060> kind<00:03:54.300> of<00:03:54.360> had<00:03:54.570> to<00:03:54.600> get<00:03:54.810> used<00:03:54.960> to<00:03:55.080> but

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:55.710 
which I kind of had to get used to but

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.140 
which I kind of had to get used to but
since<00:03:56.640> it<00:03:56.850> is<00:03:56.970> more<00:03:57.240> of<00:03:57.300> like<00:03:57.450> a<00:03:57.600> creepy<00:03:58.170> horror

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
since it is more of like a creepy horror

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.190 
since it is more of like a creepy horror
psychological<00:04:00.150> show<00:04:00.330> it<00:04:00.540> definitely<00:04:00.960> works

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
psychological show it definitely works

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.230 
psychological show it definitely works
for<00:04:01.380> this<00:04:01.620> I<00:04:01.860> don't<00:04:02.340> think<00:04:02.700> I<00:04:02.820> could<00:04:03.030> get<00:04:03.210> over

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
for this I don't think I could get over

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.510 
for this I don't think I could get over
the<00:04:03.690> super<00:04:04.050> low<00:04:04.200> mouths<00:04:04.500> and<00:04:04.800> like<00:04:05.010> a<00:04:05.040> shoujo
