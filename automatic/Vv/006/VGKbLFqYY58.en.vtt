00:00:06.369 --> 00:00:06.379 
I'm sorry this is a quick tutorial on

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:10.009 
I'm sorry this is a quick tutorial on
how<00:00:07.379> to<00:00:07.410> make<00:00:08.069> specular<00:00:08.849> highlights<00:00:09.330> onto

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
how to make specular highlights onto

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.770 
how to make specular highlights onto
textures<00:00:10.559> so<00:00:11.550> that<00:00:11.759> you<00:00:11.910> can<00:00:12.120> then<00:00:12.330> explore

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
textures so that you can then explore

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:21.010 
textures so that you can then explore
the<00:00:12.990> textures<00:00:13.500> and<00:00:13.889> add<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.490> one<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:14.759> your<00:00:14.880> man

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:30.080 

so<00:00:22.640> physically<00:00:23.640> this<00:00:23.750> cube<00:00:26.480> in<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:28.730> sphere<00:00:29.730> just

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
so physically this cube in a sphere just

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:37.479 
so physically this cube in a sphere just
because<00:00:30.660> it's<00:00:30.840> easier<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.650> put<00:00:32.640> on<00:00:32.790> smooth

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:58.580 

change<00:00:38.489> this<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.350> just<00:00:55.940> do<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.600> just<00:00:57.899> do<00:00:58.559> a

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
change this to you just do is just do a

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:10.030 
change this to you just do is just do a
quick<00:00:59.129> infinity<00:01:02.930> that's<00:01:04.460> terrible<00:01:08.000> and<00:01:09.000> then

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
quick infinity that's terrible and then

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:19.070 
quick infinity that's terrible and then
we<00:01:11.040> go<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.250> material<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.360> up<00:01:17.689> and<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.900> first

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
we go to material and up and the first

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.300 
we go to material and up and the first
thing<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.380> want<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.590> do<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:19.979> this<00:01:20.250> little

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
thing you want to do is this little

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.710 
thing you want to do is this little
button<00:01:20.729> here<00:01:20.909> which<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.540> enable<00:01:22.320> nerds<00:01:23.720> and

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
button here which is enable nerds and

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.859 
button here which is enable nerds and
I'm<00:01:25.560> just<00:01:26.009> area<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.090> changes<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.900> our<00:01:29.869> node

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
I'm just area and changes to our node

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.850 
I'm just area and changes to our node
editor<00:01:31.500> here

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.370 

if<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:38.009> sort<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.369> into<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.820> left<00:01:39.030> leg<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:39.630> I'm

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
if you sort of into the left leg so I'm

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.999 
if you sort of into the left leg so I'm
just<00:01:40.619> gonna<00:01:40.799> set<00:01:41.130> up<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.430> eat<00:01:41.700> it

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
just gonna set up and eat it

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:48.440 
just gonna set up and eat it
I<00:01:44.090> mean<00:01:45.090> it's<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.390> bit<00:01:45.570> bigger<00:01:45.840> circus<00:01:46.470> here<00:01:47.450> I'm

I mean it's a bit bigger circus here I'm
gonna<00:01:48.750> use<00:01:48.990> shift<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.939> import<00:01:51.530> extended

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
gonna use shift I import extended

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.200 
gonna use shift I import extended
material<00:01:53.299> and<00:01:54.299> then<00:01:54.420> in<00:01:54.689> this<00:01:54.899> bit<00:01:55.170> here

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
I'm going to select my and I'm gonna add

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.750 
I'm going to select my and I'm gonna add
a<00:02:08.190> color<00:02:09.190> mix

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
a color mix

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.240 
a color mix
left<00:02:12.760> click<00:02:12.910> hey<00:02:13.210> it<00:02:13.360> says<00:02:13.780> color<00:02:14.050> drag<00:02:14.980> it<00:02:15.130> to

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
left click hey it says color drag it to

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.330 
left click hey it says color drag it to
the<00:02:15.280> top<00:02:15.520> one<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:17.080> then<00:02:17.230> laughs<00:02:17.560> was<00:02:17.980> a<00:02:18.010> plate

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
the top one and then laughs was a plate

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.940 
the top one and then laughs was a plate
where<00:02:18.490> it<00:02:18.640> says<00:02:18.820> specular<00:02:19.450> so<00:02:19.870> spec<00:02:20.230> and<00:02:20.650> I<00:02:20.800> get

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
where it says specular so spec and I get

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.090 
where it says specular so spec and I get
to<00:02:21.040> call<00:02:21.220> it<00:02:21.250> two<00:02:21.570> and<00:02:22.570> then<00:02:23.260> this<00:02:23.500> color<00:02:23.800> in

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
to call it two and then this color in

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.190 
to call it two and then this color in
the<00:02:24.220> mix<00:02:24.430> gonna<00:02:24.820> track<00:02:25.090> here<00:02:25.330> like<00:02:25.570> that<00:02:25.750> and

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.140 

it<00:02:29.200> just<00:02:29.260> do<00:02:29.560> that

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
it just do that

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.170 
it just do that
and<00:02:31.150> we<00:02:31.270> can<00:02:31.420> change<00:02:31.600> our<00:02:31.780> color<00:02:32.050> here<00:02:32.410> so<00:02:33.180> I'm

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
and we can change our color here so I'm

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.470 
and we can change our color here so I'm
gonna<00:02:34.360> make<00:02:34.600> it<00:02:34.810> bit<00:02:35.050> because<00:02:35.320> I<00:02:36.209> like<00:02:37.209> pink

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
gonna make it bit because I like pink

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.310 
gonna make it bit because I like pink
with<00:02:38.020> white<00:02:38.050> highlights<00:02:39.690> and<00:02:40.690> then<00:02:41.020> what<00:02:41.200> we

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
with white highlights and then what we

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.110 
with white highlights and then what we
do

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
do

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.380 
do
that's<00:02:43.120> all<00:02:43.420> super<00:02:43.930> awesome<00:02:44.940> I'll<00:02:45.940> go<00:02:46.150> down

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
that's all super awesome I'll go down

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.300 
that's all super awesome I'll go down
wait<00:02:46.989> and<00:02:47.500> then<00:02:47.980> full<00:02:48.340> render<00:02:49.890> and<00:02:50.890> there's

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
wait and then full render and there's

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.760 
wait and then full render and there's
our<00:02:51.489> specular<00:02:51.970> highlighting<00:02:52.420> done<00:02:53.290> with<00:02:53.650> the

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
our specular highlighting done with the

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.150 
our specular highlighting done with the
shiny<00:02:54.040> and<00:02:54.280> everything<00:02:55.560> you'll<00:02:56.560> see<00:02:56.830> in<00:02:57.040> the

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
shiny and everything you'll see in the

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.449 
shiny and everything you'll see in the
texture<00:02:57.580> it's<00:02:57.730> all<00:02:57.910> baked<00:02:58.150> it<00:02:59.040> and<00:03:00.040> that's<00:03:00.250> it

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
texture it's all baked it and that's it

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.380 
texture it's all baked it and that's it
it's<00:03:01.000> very<00:03:01.209> simple<00:03:01.720> you<00:03:01.959> can<00:03:02.530> mess<00:03:02.769> with<00:03:02.799> the

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
it's very simple you can mess with the

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:10.800 
it's very simple you can mess with the
reflectivity<00:03:04.390> here<00:03:07.080> and<00:03:08.080> the<00:03:09.040> ambient<00:03:09.810> the

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
reflectivity here and the ambient the

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.680 
reflectivity here and the ambient the
sounds<00:03:11.260> and<00:03:11.440> stuff<00:03:11.620> like<00:03:11.830> that<00:03:12.299> you<00:03:13.299> can<00:03:13.360> also

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
sounds and stuff like that you can also

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.039 
sounds and stuff like that you can also
mess<00:03:14.110> with<00:03:14.440> the<00:03:14.680> mix<00:03:15.670> layers<00:03:16.660> so<00:03:17.320> I<00:03:17.590> mix<00:03:18.489> you

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
mess with the mix layers so I mix you

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.620 
mess with the mix layers so I mix you
can<00:03:20.049> add<00:03:20.260> it<00:03:20.470> put<00:03:21.100> on<00:03:21.310> add<00:03:21.519> to<00:03:21.940> make<00:03:22.420> it

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
can add it put on add to make it

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.030 
can add it put on add to make it
brighter<00:03:24.690> and<00:03:25.690> that<00:03:26.170> makes<00:03:26.380> it<00:03:26.530> more<00:03:26.680> like

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
brighter and that makes it more like

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.270 
brighter and that makes it more like
it's<00:03:27.340> actual<00:03:27.700> color<00:03:28.650> and<00:03:29.650> that's<00:03:29.860> it<00:03:30.070> very

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
it's actual color and that's it very

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.890 
it's actual color and that's it very
simple<00:03:30.670> very<00:03:31.330> quick<00:03:31.780> and<00:03:32.260> very<00:03:32.290> easy
