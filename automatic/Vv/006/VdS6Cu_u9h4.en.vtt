in<00:00:10.260> this<00:00:10.440> tech<00:00:10.710> tip<00:00:10.920> we're<00:00:11.070> going<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.280> talk

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
in this tech tip we're going to talk

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.610 
in this tech tip we're going to talk
about<00:00:11.610> white<00:00:12.030> balance<00:00:12.509> what<00:00:12.900> is<00:00:13.080> white<00:00:13.380> bounce

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
about white balance what is white bounce

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.289 
about white balance what is white bounce
well<00:00:13.889> it's<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.070> calibration<00:00:14.610> or<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:14.940> setting

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
well it's a calibration or a setting

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.120 
well it's a calibration or a setting
within<00:00:15.450> your<00:00:15.719> camera<00:00:16.080> that<00:00:16.590> tells<00:00:16.890> your

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
within your camera that tells your

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.130 
within your camera that tells your
camera<00:00:17.699> whatever<00:00:18.390> you're<00:00:18.570> showing<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:18.960> it<00:00:19.050> at

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
camera whatever you're showing to it at

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.019 
camera whatever you're showing to it at
that<00:00:19.260> time<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.680> white<00:00:19.949> so<00:00:20.279> you<00:00:20.369> can<00:00:20.609> hold<00:00:20.789> up<00:00:20.910> a

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
that time is white so you can hold up a

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.670 
that time is white so you can hold up a
white<00:00:21.240> piece<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.480> paper<00:00:21.660> could<00:00:22.199> be<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.350> script

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
white piece of paper could be a script

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.509 
white piece of paper could be a script
page<00:00:22.859> whatever<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.320> and<00:00:25.320> hit<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.220> white

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
page whatever and and hit the white

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.939 
page whatever and and hit the white
balance<00:00:26.670> button<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.689> that<00:00:27.990> will<00:00:28.050> tell<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.650> hey

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
balance button and that will tell it hey

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.830 
balance button and that will tell it hey
this<00:00:29.189> is<00:00:29.340> white<00:00:29.550> so<00:00:29.580> it'll<00:00:30.029> know<00:00:30.119> that<00:00:30.300> my<00:00:30.449> skin

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
this is white so it'll know that my skin

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.220 
this is white so it'll know that my skin
is<00:00:31.430> flesh<00:00:32.430> tone<00:00:32.730> pink<00:00:33.300> flesh<00:00:33.510> dumps<00:00:33.870> this

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
is flesh tone pink flesh dumps this

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.010 
is flesh tone pink flesh dumps this
folder<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:34.950> red<00:00:35.280> this<00:00:35.910> tennis<00:00:36.300> ball<00:00:36.329> is<00:00:36.690> green

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
folder is red this tennis ball is green

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.869 
folder is red this tennis ball is green
so<00:00:37.770> if<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:37.950> white<00:00:38.129> balance<00:00:38.430> on<00:00:38.550> something

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
so if you white balance on something

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.910 
so if you white balance on something
else<00:00:39.059> say<00:00:39.719> this<00:00:39.870> red<00:00:40.079> folder<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.770> would

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
else say this red folder it would

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.190 
else say this red folder it would
actually<00:00:41.100> skew<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.879> color<00:00:42.210> balance<00:00:42.660> let's

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
actually skew the color balance let's

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.350 
actually skew the color balance let's
take<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.410> look<00:00:43.620> at<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.800> if<00:00:44.100> we<00:00:44.280> did<00:00:44.460> wipeouts<00:00:45.059> on

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
take a look at it if we did wipeouts on

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.930 
take a look at it if we did wipeouts on
this<00:00:45.539> red<00:00:45.840> folder<00:00:48.950> so<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.039> can<00:00:50.219> see<00:00:50.399> now<00:00:50.610> we've

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
this red folder so you can see now we've

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.360 
this red folder so you can see now we've
wipeouts<00:00:51.480> on<00:00:51.719> this<00:00:51.930> red<00:00:52.170> folder<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:53.129> it's

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
wipeouts on this red folder and it's

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.729 
wipeouts on this red folder and it's
totally<00:00:53.670> skewed<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.539> color<00:00:54.750> spectrum<00:00:54.960> to

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
totally skewed the color spectrum to

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.340 
totally skewed the color spectrum to
where<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:56.129> now<00:00:56.340> look<00:00:56.550> like<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.910> Hulk<00:00:57.180> so<00:00:58.140> if<00:00:58.230> you

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
where I now look like the Hulk so if you

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.170 
where I now look like the Hulk so if you
want<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.620> go<00:00:58.710> for<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:59.039> kind<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.280> weird<00:00:59.520> green

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
want to go for that kind of weird green

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.060 
want to go for that kind of weird green
fluorescent<00:01:00.840> look<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.530> might<00:01:01.739> be<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.890> way<00:01:02.039> to

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
fluorescent look this might be a way to

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.850 
fluorescent look this might be a way to
do<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.430> so<00:01:03.180> now<00:01:03.510> we've<00:01:04.019> white<00:01:04.290> balance<00:01:04.650> on<00:01:04.830> a

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
do it so now we've white balance on a

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.210 
do it so now we've white balance on a
blue<00:01:05.189> gel<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:06.260> it's<00:01:07.260> shifted<00:01:07.680> toward<00:01:07.950> the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
blue gel and it's shifted toward the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.700 
blue gel and it's shifted toward the
warm<00:01:08.640> spectrum<00:01:09.210> kind<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.630> gas<00:01:09.990> lamp<00:01:10.290> feel<00:01:10.530> or

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
warm spectrum kind of a gas lamp feel or

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.859 
warm spectrum kind of a gas lamp feel or
a<00:01:10.770> violent<00:01:11.220> feel<00:01:11.490> but<00:01:12.150> it's<00:01:12.270> all<00:01:12.420> kinds<00:01:12.840> of

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
a violent feel but it's all kinds of

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.690 
a violent feel but it's all kinds of
experimenting<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.680> can<00:01:13.830> do<00:01:14.010> with<00:01:14.369> white

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
experimenting you can do with white

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.550 
experimenting you can do with white
balancing<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.299> get<00:01:15.450> different<00:01:15.659> works<00:01:16.020> with

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
balancing to get different works with

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.810 
balancing to get different works with
white<00:01:16.740> balance<00:01:17.100> you're<00:01:17.250> dealing<00:01:17.520> with<00:01:17.549> the

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
white balance you're dealing with the

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.330 
white balance you're dealing with the
visual<00:01:18.210> spectrum<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.930> light<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.439> for

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
visual spectrum of light and for

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.980 
visual spectrum of light and for
filmmaking<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:21.000> two<00:01:21.210> biggies<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.630> deal<00:01:21.810> with

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
to play with white balance is to create

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.090 
to play with white balance is to create
a<00:01:36.180> day<00:01:36.360> for<00:01:36.570> night<00:01:36.720> work<00:01:36.750> where<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.710> actually

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
a day for night work where you actually

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.910 
a day for night work where you actually
balance<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:39.000> camera<00:01:39.450> on<00:01:39.630> something<00:01:40.470> warm<00:01:40.770> to

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
balance the camera on something warm to

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.889 
balance the camera on something warm to
give<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.159> blue<00:01:41.430> look<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.970> under<00:01:42.479> expose<00:01:42.869> a

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
give a blue look and under expose a

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.810 
give a blue look and under expose a
little<00:01:43.350> bit<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:44.040> make<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.189> look<00:01:44.460> like<00:01:44.579> it's

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
little bit to make it look like it's

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.219 
little bit to make it look like it's
night<00:01:45.030> now<00:01:45.600> one<00:01:45.780> of<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.930> things<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.140> don't

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
night now one of the things you don't

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.719 
night now one of the things you don't
want<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.470> do<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:46.770> paint<00:01:47.040> up<00:01:47.189> toward<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.460> sky

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
want to do is paint up toward the sky

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.670 
want to do is paint up toward the sky
it's<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.119> dead<00:01:48.329> giveaway<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:49.290> you're

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
it's a dead giveaway that you're
