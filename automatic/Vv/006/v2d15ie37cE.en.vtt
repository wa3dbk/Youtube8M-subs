nine<00:05:16.380> pages<00:05:16.800> shouldn't<00:05:17.580> take<00:05:17.610> too<00:05:17.760> long<00:05:18.290> and

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
nine pages shouldn't take too long and

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.250 
nine pages shouldn't take too long and
again<00:05:20.520> I'm<00:05:20.820> checking<00:05:21.150> its<00:05:21.510> below<00:05:21.960> one<00:05:22.230> hundred

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
again I'm checking its below one hundred

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.020 
again I'm checking its below one hundred
percent<00:05:22.590> so<00:05:23.250> I<00:05:23.280> know<00:05:23.400> I'm<00:05:23.610> going<00:05:23.760> to<00:05:23.850> make<00:05:24.000> a

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
percent so I know I'm going to make a

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:30.970 
percent so I know I'm going to make a
profit

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:30.980 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:36.010 

and<00:05:31.660> so<00:05:32.660> on<00:05:32.900> so<00:05:33.290> stop<00:05:34.280> there<00:05:34.730> I<00:05:35.180> guess<00:05:35.660> I<00:05:35.810> got

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
and so on so stop there I guess I got

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.840
