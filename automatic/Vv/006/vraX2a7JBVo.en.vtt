use my index finger and it'll look like

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.100 
use my index finger and it'll look like
this<00:02:52.830> on<00:02:53.830> beats<00:02:54.400> two<00:02:54.670> and<00:02:54.700> four<00:02:54.879> I<00:02:55.269> do<00:02:55.810> a

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
this on beats two and four I do a

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.680 
this on beats two and four I do a
percussive<00:02:56.680> hit<00:02:56.709> or<00:02:57.129> a<00:02:57.190> muted<00:02:57.730> strum<00:02:58.000> this<00:02:58.510> is

percussive hit or a muted strum this is

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.420 
percussive hit or a muted strum this is
supposed<00:02:58.900> to<00:02:58.959> imitate<00:02:59.170> the<00:02:59.920> drum<00:03:00.160> players

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
supposed to imitate the drum players

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.940 
supposed to imitate the drum players

the bass strings to where it is the
frets<00:03:10.829> in<00:03:11.829> order<00:03:12.099> to<00:03:12.220> do<00:03:12.340> the<00:03:12.519> muted<00:03:12.819> strum<00:03:13.090> you

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
frets in order to do the muted strum you

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.000 
frets in order to do the muted strum you
would<00:03:13.870> use<00:03:14.019> your<00:03:14.110> left<00:03:14.349> hand<00:03:14.440> and<00:03:14.860> then

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
would use your left hand and then

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.530 
would use your left hand and then
lightly<00:03:15.310> and<00:03:15.549> you<00:03:15.670> the<00:03:15.849> strings<00:03:16.150> while<00:03:16.390> you

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
lightly and you the strings while you

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.970 
lightly and you the strings while you
play<00:03:18.840> so<00:03:19.840> let's<00:03:19.959> practice<00:03:20.170> this<00:03:20.500> drum<00:03:20.709> pattern

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
play so let's practice this drum pattern

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.500 
play so let's practice this drum pattern
together<00:03:21.069> slowly<00:03:21.489> I'll<00:03:21.849> give<00:03:22.060> one<00:03:22.299> measure

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
together slowly I'll give one measure

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.759 
together slowly I'll give one measure
out<00:03:22.720> in<00:03:22.840> advance<00:03:22.959> so<00:03:23.860> one<00:03:24.220> and<00:03:24.880> two<00:03:25.599> and<00:03:26.260> three

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
out in advance so one and two and three

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:42.930 
out in advance so one and two and three
and<00:03:37.620> three<00:03:38.620> and<00:03:41.220> let's<00:03:42.220> try<00:03:42.370> this<00:03:42.430> a<00:03:42.609> little

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
and three and let's try this a little

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.910 
and three and let's try this a little
faster<00:03:43.299> one<00:03:44.139> and<00:03:44.410> two<00:03:45.040> and<00:03:45.400> three<00:03:45.790> and<00:03:46.209> four

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
faster one and two and three and four

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:56.789 
faster one and two and three and four
one<00:03:48.690> three<00:03:49.690> three<00:03:55.170> when<00:03:56.170> practicing<00:03:56.650> this

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
one three three when practicing this

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:58.710 
one three three when practicing this
drum<00:03:57.040> pattern<00:03:57.400> up<00:03:57.549> to<00:03:57.579> speed<00:03:57.910> I<00:03:58.120> recommend

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
drum pattern up to speed I recommend

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.479 
drum pattern up to speed I recommend
that<00:03:58.840> you<00:03:58.900> use<00:03:59.019> a<00:03:59.200> metronome<00:03:59.590> in<00:03:59.920> order<00:04:00.250> to

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
that you use a metronome in order to

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.910 
that you use a metronome in order to
slowly<00:04:00.940> increase<00:04:01.420> the<00:04:01.750> tempo<00:04:02.079> until<00:04:02.769> it's

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
slowly increase the tempo until it's

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.440 
slowly increase the tempo until it's
comfortable<00:04:03.130> for<00:04:03.519> you<00:04:03.670> so<00:04:04.150> let's<00:04:04.299> practice

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
comfortable for you so let's practice

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.120 
comfortable for you so let's practice
the<00:04:04.750> strum<00:04:04.989> pattern<00:04:05.290> with<00:04:05.500> the<00:04:05.590> chord<00:04:05.799> changes

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
the strum pattern with the chord changes

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.160 
the strum pattern with the chord changes
each<00:04:06.670> board<00:04:07.030> gets<00:04:07.209> one<00:04:07.420> full<00:04:07.690> measure<00:04:07.900> of<00:04:08.019> the

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
each board gets one full measure of the

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.050 
each board gets one full measure of the
strum<00:04:08.410> pattern<00:04:08.769> at<00:04:09.310> the<00:04:09.459> beginning<00:04:09.760> of<00:04:09.940> each

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
strum pattern at the beginning of each

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.780 
strum pattern at the beginning of each
measure<00:04:10.329> you<00:04:10.750> will<00:04:10.870> switch<00:04:11.079> chords<00:04:11.639> so<00:04:12.639> let's

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
measure you will switch chords so let's

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.699 
measure you will switch chords so let's
begin<00:04:12.910> practicing<00:04:13.540> with<00:04:13.750> the<00:04:13.870> verse<00:04:14.049> I'll

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
begin practicing with the verse I'll

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:17.819 
begin practicing with the verse I'll
give<00:04:15.010> one<00:04:15.310> measure<00:04:15.489> how<00:04:15.700> advanced<00:04:16.500> one<00:04:17.500> and

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
give one measure how advanced one and

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:18.879 
give one measure how advanced one and
two

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
two

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:37.959 
two
and<00:04:19.009> three<00:04:36.129> so<00:04:37.129> let's<00:04:37.159> practice<00:04:37.430> the<00:04:37.759> chord

00:04:37.959 --> 00:04:37.969 
and three so let's practice the chord

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:39.969 
and three so let's practice the chord
change<00:04:38.240> that's<00:04:38.539> used<00:04:38.810> in<00:04:39.020> the<00:04:39.110> pre-course<00:04:39.560> the
