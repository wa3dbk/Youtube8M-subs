00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 
the glovebox a little bit I'm using my

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.560 
the glovebox a little bit I'm using my

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
need to push on it and then you just

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.380 
need to push on it and then you just
pull<00:00:40.840> out<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:43.629> then<00:00:43.980> slowly<00:00:44.980> the<00:00:45.430> thing<00:00:46.239> will

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
pull out and then slowly the thing will

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.450 
pull out and then slowly the thing will
fall<00:00:46.690> it<00:00:47.320> actually<00:00:47.649> falls<00:00:48.430> quite<00:00:48.969> far<00:00:50.460> there

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
fall it actually falls quite far there

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.580 
fall it actually falls quite far there
is<00:00:51.640> a<00:00:51.670> cable<00:00:52.059> here<00:00:52.270> so<00:00:52.719> just<00:00:52.750> be<00:00:53.050> careful<00:00:53.260> that

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
is a cable here so just be careful that

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.410 
is a cable here so just be careful that
you<00:00:53.710> don't<00:00:55.410> upset<00:00:56.410> any<00:00:56.590> of<00:00:56.769> the<00:00:57.120> wires<00:00:58.120> or

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
in the back here you guys can see it

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.540 
in the back here you guys can see it
should<00:01:04.570> be<00:01:04.660> two<00:01:04.930> clips<00:01:05.230> I'm<00:01:06.010> gonna<00:01:06.190> rest<00:01:06.400> the

face as you can see mine is quite dusty

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.310 
face as you can see mine is quite dusty
I<00:01:33.930> probably<00:01:34.830> have<00:01:35.010> to<00:01:35.130> replace<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.670> again

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.510 

others<00:01:40.320> own<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.740> just<00:01:40.950> pick<00:01:41.310> up<00:01:41.400> a

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
others own and just pick up a

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.760 
others own and just pick up a
replacement<00:01:42.180> filter<00:01:42.540> it's<00:01:43.200> quite<00:01:43.410> cheaper

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
replacement filter it's quite cheaper

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.060 
replacement filter it's quite cheaper
than<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.040> dealership<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:45.050> I<00:01:46.050> think<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.920> only

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
than the dealership and I think the only

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.580 
than the dealership and I think the only
thing<00:01:47.160> yet<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.700> make<00:01:47.940> sure<00:01:48.150> that<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.350> arrow

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
thing yet to make sure that the arrow

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:56.420 
thing yet to make sure that the arrow
says<00:01:50.100> airflow<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:51.090> right<00:01:51.300> way<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:52.729> make<00:01:55.430> sure

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
says airflow the right way and make sure

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.510 
says airflow the right way and make sure
when<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:57.000> install<00:01:57.869> on<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:59.000> have<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.030> filter

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
when you install on you have a filter

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.460 
when you install on you have a filter
make<00:02:02.520> sure<00:02:02.700> it's<00:02:02.940> nice<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.149> tight<00:02:03.540> so<00:02:06.320> say<00:02:07.320> the

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
make sure it's nice and tight so say the

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.870 
make sure it's nice and tight so say the
filters<00:02:07.830> out<00:02:08.009> I<00:02:08.220> don't<00:02:08.399> have<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.550> replacement

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
filters out I don't have a replacement

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.199 
filters out I don't have a replacement
right<00:02:09.300> now<00:02:10.040> it's<00:02:11.040> gonna<00:02:11.160> have<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.790> hard<00:02:12.030> edges

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
right now it's gonna have the hard edges

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.630 
right now it's gonna have the hard edges
and<00:02:12.660> then<00:02:13.260> you<00:02:13.380> want<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.680> lines<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.100> meet<00:02:14.489> up

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
and then you want the lines to meet up

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.590 
and then you want the lines to meet up
with<00:02:14.820> the<00:02:14.970> ridges<00:02:15.300> over<00:02:15.570> here<00:02:16.700> you<00:02:17.700> want<00:02:17.970> wants

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
with the ridges over here you want wants

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.680 
with the ridges over here you want wants
to<00:02:18.690> meet<00:02:18.870> up<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.140> ridges<00:02:19.500> right<00:02:19.709> here<00:02:20.600> so<00:02:21.600> when

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
to meet up the ridges right here so when

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.910 
to meet up the ridges right here so when
you've<00:02:21.840> entered<00:02:22.320> the<00:02:22.470> filter<00:02:24.590> you<00:02:25.590> want<00:02:25.739> to

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
you've entered the filter you want to

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.820 
you've entered the filter you want to
push<00:02:26.130> it<00:02:26.310> in<00:02:26.489> I<00:02:27.019> just<00:02:28.019> squeezed<00:02:28.230> it<00:02:28.410> in<00:02:28.560> pretty

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
push it in I just squeezed it in pretty

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.000 
push it in I just squeezed it in pretty
much<00:02:29.120> you<00:02:30.120> see<00:02:30.360> how<00:02:30.510> this<00:02:30.750> isn't<00:02:31.110> lined<00:02:31.620> up<00:02:31.830> you

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
much you see how this isn't lined up you
