00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hi girls it's miss her then 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.870
 today I'm going to talk to you about this 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.090
 produces a friend of mine and for keeps 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.340
 new york and she brought me back this product 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.250
 there that I absolutely did not want that 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.800
 I saw on several youtube channels 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.869
 us American and apparently he is 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.470
 super super super effective so he me 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.810
 absolutely needed this product which 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.420
 serves to not shine in fact you 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.580
 use it as a base before the 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.810
 makeup and you do not laugh at all 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.450
 the day to the whole evening in 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.000
 according to what you have to donate 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.489
 which is called milk of my asia 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.860
 the brand philips and at the level of the 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.320
 composition is magnesium hydroxide 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.539
 so it's 100% magnesium done so 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.640
 me actually my problem is that when 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.030
 I wear makeup after an hour 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:57.030
 level of the nose and around one and there 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:59.340
 I shine I shine it's limit 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.550
 if I touch my nose I can hydrate myself 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.409
 all the lips with and where I know that 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.180
 it's disgusting but it's so that 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.049
 you can understand what is 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.250
 my problem what's there then me that I 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.350
 invite you to do that was going to see the 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.450

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.670

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.990
 youtube american time 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.770
 this product there unfortunately we do not 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.159
 not find in France 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.900
 you can buy it on amazon and if 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.850
 you are lucky enough to live in new york 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.790
 like my girlfriend katia who I do a 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.329
 big kiss she can buy it this 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.799
 product at so old age so there this 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.079
 what I did was that I filmed you 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.430
 the product application and I have you 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.649
 make my first impressions 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.800
 so I'll start by hydrating myself 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:51.860
 face anyway 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:57.710
 not see the face dry so I use my 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:02:02.890
 diadermine cream a pea cut h7 that 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:09.619
 I had seen on the jade chain aviv 30 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:22.250
 now we are looking for and I believe it 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:28.810
 must this blow up a little bit in the 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:30.890
 bowl and there I will use my brush 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.730
 I like being places where I have 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.730
 tendency to shine 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:43.010
 so it's mostly the nose and the beginning 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.860
 Now days there I left to dry 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.900
 so an end that it is that we are supposed 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.030
 have a slow resume on the face in 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.760
 does that that's going to help us not to 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.800
 trim all day or any 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:59.920
 so tonight is here now I'm going 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.920
 to put makeup on this base 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.569
 so here's the finish the rest of my 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:58.280
 off- camera makeup we're going to look 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.280
 the time it is so it is 13:30 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:05.640
 it's exactly 13:30 pm I'm going back 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:08.100
 to see if after 4 to 5 hours I 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.120
 shine or not etc this product works 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.160
 or not 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:16.290
 hello girls then the fall of 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:18.329
 back and it's 17 hours 23 very 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.840
 exactly and I applied the product to 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:23.820
 13:30 and there for now my skin is 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.590
 not billups as she is used to 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:29.640
 be, since usually requires a 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:32.850
 time in this zone there is full 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:35.430
 of oil what so I will continue to 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.350
 test the product in the long run 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.060
