00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.570
 We know details about the new up 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.710

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.470
 vctor and it will be well include syndicate that 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.989
 is the official name already ubisoft so what 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.340
 revealed we already know the new name of 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.129
 the sauce include we have expected so much 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.480
 to know and we already know that this new 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.250
 delivery of the saga will take place in 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.170
 london and that his official name will be 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.120
 assassin's creed síndica and we met 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.270
 some of the details after having 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.399
 seen images of this games and images 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.700
 promotional what made the official 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.570
 ubisoft people with we listen and I 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.989
 It caught my attention 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:01.020
 characteristic 26 of queens or the anthem 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.870
 from britain there we hear it in 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.140
 one of the videos that the 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.240
 ubisoft people in this particularity 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.430
 in this delivery the world in which we 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.970
 we will find in the game 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:18.960
 is a world of change is set in 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:22.290
 the late Victorian era of the 80's 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.290
 1800 at that time where the 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.270
 industrial revolution there was the 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.200
 industrial revolution bringing 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:34.290
 world a big significant change to 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.100
 level of inventions the machine did not appear 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:41.880
 the cars were developed a london 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:47.070
 that evolved and grew tremendously in 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.229
 this section in this specific game 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.420
 which no longer send or kings 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.909
 religion but there is a domain in 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.880
 the mind there is progress also in the 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.070
 medicine there is progress in science in the 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.260
 mechanical but it's also when it appears 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.680
 organized crime and that's where 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:07.410
 enter the name syndicate because the 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.110
 people joining in groups to defend 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.600
 their own interests those groups are 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.220
 those that are known as unions in 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.220
 that moment they were unions of 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.380
 murderers the unions of people who 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.480
 I tried to fight each other and good 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.180
 our protagonist who later on 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.709
 I will comment his name is one of the 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.590
 that he organizes with his sister because 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.840
 eye brings this particularity will have the 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.970
 presence of a sister and that is what 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.860
 most curious of these click because 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.239
 we can entrust jake so much because 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.230
 is the name of the original character and 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.360
 his twin sister and vii and vii 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.400
 now he will have this opportunity to take 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.420
 the protagónico roll more click I do not 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.129
 Look, I'm talking to people 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.989
 I'm telling them about the new year 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:51.110
 include you will also go to 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:54.319
 the head the first one already commented to them and 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.540
 keiko he is a real killer 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.239
 we've heard about it is a 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.819
 killer authentic hunter who is 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:05.060
 armed with machete with revolver can 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:07.700
 use knives to roll to throw 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.739
 we also have fists that is a 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.130
 innovation because we will be able to enter 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.230
 hits us put clean 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.950
 with the rivals and of course we will have 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.570
 the killer glove already traditional with 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.150
 some improvements because we have even 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.220
 seen that there is a kind of rope that 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.500
 gets hooked on the heights and we can 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.980
 use something like spider-man more or 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.810
 less keeping of course the some 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.970
 caveats according to the creators the 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.550
 combat will be much faster in this 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.310
 game and close that in any of the 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.110
 other previous deliveries are also going 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.360
 to incorporate for the first time 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.990
 vehicles and this is important many 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.010
 maybe they are going to already say their people to not if 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.770
 we are fine but we are talking 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.630
 with people so to silence them 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.240
 he said we can use vehicles in 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.100
 this new and include we will be able to pilot 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:00.460
 we can jump between them and 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:03.010
 we can even kill the pilot and 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:06.890
 murder about them we talk about the 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:11.780
 cars already know that you are green 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.780
 I do not do business at this time 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.520
 permission 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.500
 why 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.800
 ah 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:40.830
 so we're going to have three in a carriage 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.120
 something that in other games we will have a 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.830
 He throws rope and told him about the 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.120
 Agrees we will not have this 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.490
 opportunity 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.590
 attached to the killer's glove is going to 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.860
 allow to reach much higher areas 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:56.580
 more easily and quickly not to yes 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.780
 same as spider-man likewise we're going to 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.570
 be more or less the majority of 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:03.120
 circuits you know you had 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.550
 incorporated the clothing here he's going to 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.380
 have also the killer's hood 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:11.010
 but he's also going to have the character and 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.750
 hector is going to have a hat most 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:16.260
 of the inclusions that we will find 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:18.180
 with rival bands we're going to have to be 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.950
 very cautious nothing to attack from front 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.060
 because they agree that at that time 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.060
 We could talk like here 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.840
 in the waist think that only 75 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:30.979
 years of difference between united and 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.030
 syndicate 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:35.370
 basically we're going to have to have the 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.320
 hidden weapons to be able to attack like this 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:40.320
 that stealth is going to be a protagonist 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.240
 important in the next ace so 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.270
 We can also use our 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.410
 environmental skills make us 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.600
 get rid of our friends with all 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:50.490
 that kind of tools that offers us 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.650
 the environment to be able to save our 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.970
 ally and little because to make us the 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:57.210
 city ​​because we have to earn the 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.530
 districts to be able to advance within the 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.330
 I play the story without a doubt going to 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.740
 be interesting because as I said in 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.389
 the final part of the time of the 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:07.030
 revolution we are already approaching is 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:09.160
 entering already in 1900 and 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:12.730
 this is one of the great innovations that 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:15.340
 shows already told them the part of the 

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:16.930
 rope and of course the big news what 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.690
 that everyone wants to know but tell us 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.760
 when the new a5 comes out it's good like that 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:24.580
 include syndicate will be exclusive 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:29.590
 to expose and playstation 4 in the 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:33.220
 autumn will already be available on the 23rd 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:36.460
 October will already be on sale this new 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:38.890
 Assassin's Creed called that 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.990
 will call as I already mentioned is like this 

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:45.310
 include without dam and talking a little 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:48.250
 more than history is as such 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:50.350
 remember that jake or we can have a 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:53.590
 of the two people the innovation of the 

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:55.450
 cars we are going to have of course the 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:57.640
 ability to have a stealth 

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:59.860
 adequate to do not the city and I 

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.790
 I invite you to be aware of 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.010
 our channel because later 

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:04.699
 we will be placing videos there is already a 

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:07.350
 gameplay 

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:09.300
 commented on 10 minutes of this 

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:11.699
 fascinating game this great important 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.560
 saga that we will surely enjoy and 

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:15.509
 let's have our hands to be able 

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:18.330
 bring you all the details in 

00:07:15.509 --> 00:07:21.479
 images you are seeing already the last 

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:24.750
 what's left is Mr. Arno here in Asia 

00:07:21.479 --> 00:07:27.419
 singlistas and unite and we 

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:29.100
 say goodbye for now so be prepared 

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:31.039
 all for October 23 because the 

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:34.250
 parco returns but this time 

00:07:31.039 --> 00:07:37.740
 from the roofs of the london 

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:39.150

 bye
