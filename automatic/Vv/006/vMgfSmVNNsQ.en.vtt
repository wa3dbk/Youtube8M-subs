piece of lead off side of a tire ready
hit<00:00:24.910> it<00:00:24.970> pretty<00:00:25.150> hard<00:00:25.330> I<00:00:25.839> thought<00:00:26.169> it<00:00:26.230> was

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:26.289 
hit it pretty hard I thought it was

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289 
going to be something gold and it turned

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:30.720 
going to be something gold and it turned
out<00:00:29.349> to<00:00:29.470> be<00:00:29.560> led<00:00:29.829> so<00:00:30.159> it's<00:00:30.339> pretty<00:00:30.460> close

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730

in a double pot next to a high tone with
these<00:01:02.140> xterra<00:01:02.620> as<00:01:02.740> these<00:01:02.950> things<00:01:03.190> are

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
these xterra as these things are

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.899 
these xterra as these things are
sensitive<00:01:04.600> to<00:01:04.869> all<00:01:05.350> things<00:01:05.710> so<00:01:06.100> if<00:01:06.250> you<00:01:06.490> hear

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
sensitive to all things so if you hear

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:09.859 
sensitive to all things so if you hear
double<00:01:07.479> noise<00:01:07.659> on<00:01:08.020> a<00:01:08.079> hit<00:01:09.009> with<00:01:09.249> one<00:01:09.429> of<00:01:09.520> these

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
double noise on a hit with one of these

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.560 
double noise on a hit with one of these
definitely<00:01:10.869> dig<00:01:11.200> it<00:01:11.380> I<00:01:11.560> did<00:01:12.100> and<00:01:13.060> you<00:01:13.179> can<00:01:13.329> see

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
definitely dig it I did and you can see

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.069 
definitely dig it I did and you can see
that<00:01:13.600> pays<00:01:14.079> off<00:01:14.350> I<00:01:14.969> love<00:01:15.969> this<00:01:16.119> xterra<00:01:16.689> because

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:17.079 
that pays off I love this xterra because

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:18.809 
that pays off I love this xterra because
it's<00:01:17.289> so<00:01:17.469> sensitive<00:01:17.890> that<00:01:18.070> I<00:01:18.429> don't<00:01:18.609> even<00:01:18.700> have

00:01:18.809 --> 00:01:18.819 
it's so sensitive that I don't even have

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:20.849 
it's so sensitive that I don't even have
to<00:01:18.999> think<00:01:19.030> twice<00:01:19.450> sometimes<00:01:20.170> about<00:01:20.499> what<00:01:20.740> I'm

00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:20.859 
to think twice sometimes about what I'm

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:24.510 
to think twice sometimes about what I'm
picking<00:01:21.219> up<00:01:21.340> on<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:22.659> my<00:01:23.319> advice<00:01:23.380> is<00:01:23.619> pick<00:01:24.340> one
