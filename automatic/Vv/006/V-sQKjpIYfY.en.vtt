00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:36.670
 these were people who worked with new 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.489
 know technologies what is changed 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.170
 state of consciousness how to shoot 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.960
 remote information from people on 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:48.190
 photos in the image and so on and here 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:51.940
 then we started working together we and 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:54.519
 did we filmed information with 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.920
 information field means using 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:59.769
 here are the sensitive people who could 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.519
 boot using self-hypnosis here in 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:05.619
 this is an altered state of consciousness and 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:08.640
 started to read information from them 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:11.740
 technologies and not turned out for a long time and 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.680
 here's an example of technologies such as would 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:20.560
 spontaneous we can observe in the same 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:25.460
 galkin and maxim he does not copy people he 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:28.520
 adjusts to a subtle level and how 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.210
 would come in here this person and along 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.610
 with those 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.300
 mean habits of voice there different 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.290
 species 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.770
 by antics means he can if his 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.990
 he can learn a little bit easily and 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.790
 reader formation 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:50.570
 possible intentions about the past and the future 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:53.350
 there and so on these technologies they were 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:57.710
 still known in pre-christian russia and 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:00.830
 our ancestors when needed advice 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:04.820
 some get what they did they 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.800
 came to the temple means it started there 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:11.540
 prayed were in this state 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:14.780
 also here's how the shaman does they who 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.780
 enters this state by dancing 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.720
 who walks in using drugs who with 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:24.019
 using odors since 5 receptors 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.299
 which we have means impact on 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.549
 they can be loaded in a certain way 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:31.010
 man in an altered state of consciousness 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:34.459
 but the physiology itself shows that 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:37.690
 every 90 minutes a person goes into it 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.710
 state automatically need it 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.550
 can for 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:46.700
 somewhere offloading something because here's 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:49.280
 such moments we just do not notice and with 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.640
 side it looks so sort of 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.160
 the man wondered where he started there 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.880
 ask by name there for example nikolay 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.550
 Nikolay 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:02.270
 and he does not respond he is here in 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:05.330
 this state of shutdown here and then and he 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:09.490
 I thought as it's just been here 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.490
 in this altered state of consciousness
