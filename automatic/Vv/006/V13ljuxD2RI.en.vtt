come up on mice to them and another
thing<00:00:27.400> was<00:00:27.550> I<00:00:27.699> would<00:00:27.820> click<00:00:28.359> on<00:00:28.509> the<00:00:28.660> game<00:00:28.840> and

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830 
thing was I would click on the game and

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.919 
thing was I would click on the game and
it<00:00:30.009> would<00:00:30.099> take<00:00:30.339> forever<00:00:30.640> for<00:00:31.150> it<00:00:31.359> to<00:00:31.630> finally

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
a little a method that I used to help

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.160 
a little a method that I used to help
get<00:00:36.880> rid<00:00:37.000> of<00:00:37.090> that<00:00:37.240> and<00:00:37.480> help<00:00:37.840> actually

increase<00:00:38.920> your<00:00:39.160> speed<00:00:39.460> online<00:00:39.700> if<00:00:40.240> you<00:00:40.420> maybe

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
increase your speed online if you maybe

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.930 
increase your speed online if you maybe
have<00:00:40.750> lag<00:00:40.960> spikes<00:00:41.380> this<00:00:42.280> also<00:00:42.610> helps<00:00:42.850> with

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
have lag spikes this also helps with

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.940 
have lag spikes this also helps with
that<00:00:43.150> just<00:00:43.900> connection<00:00:44.320> just<00:00:44.560> jumping<00:00:44.920> from

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:44.950 
that just connection just jumping from

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.420 
that just connection just jumping from
100<00:00:45.460> to<00:00:45.490> 80<00:00:45.820> and<00:00:46.210> if<00:00:47.080> you<00:00:47.170> didn't<00:00:47.410> know<00:00:47.440> 80%

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
100 to 80 and if you didn't know 80%

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.570 
100 to 80 and if you didn't know 80%
about<00:00:49.300> 79<00:00:50.080> which<00:00:50.350> you<00:00:50.440> get<00:00:50.560> 279<00:00:51.130> signal

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:51.580 
about 79 which you get 279 signal

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.490 
about 79 which you get 279 signal
strength<00:00:51.850> and<00:00:52.060> you<00:00:52.690> can<00:00:52.870> check<00:00:53.110> that<00:00:53.260> by<00:00:53.380> going

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
strength and you can check that by going

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.630 
strength and you can check that by going
to<00:00:53.680> settings<00:00:54.540> network<00:00:55.540> settings<00:00:55.960> and

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
to settings network settings and

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.700 
to settings network settings and
settings<00:00:57.640> and<00:00:57.760> connect<00:00:58.090> just<00:00:58.710> connections

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
settings and connect just connections

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.490 
settings and connect just connections
status<00:01:00.400> lists<00:01:00.820> and<00:01:01.360> it<00:01:02.110> will<00:01:02.200> show<00:01:02.350> you<00:01:02.410> your

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
status lists and it will show you your

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.690 
status lists and it will show you your
signal<00:01:02.860> strength<00:01:02.890> usually<00:01:03.520> if<00:01:03.580> you<00:01:03.640> have

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:03.700 
signal strength usually if you have

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.109 
signal strength usually if you have
about<00:01:04.030> an<00:01:04.269> 80%<00:01:04.570> connection<00:01:05.320> you'll<00:01:05.530> have<00:01:05.740> a

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
about an 80% connection you'll have a

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.560 
about an 80% connection you'll have a
decent<00:01:07.119> connection<00:01:07.539> and<00:01:09.149> yeah<00:01:10.149> but<00:01:10.329> here's

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
decent connection and yeah but here's

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.099
