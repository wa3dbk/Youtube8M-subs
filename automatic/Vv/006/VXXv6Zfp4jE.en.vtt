00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.890
 hello today see us I bring a new video 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:09.970
 from the pj chu long 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:12.610
 this kubot I bought it for amazon and 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:16.029
 it has left me about 10 dollars good today 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.520
 I'll talk about the turn the turn is a cube 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:21.160
 pretty fast really is a cube that 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.670
 as soon as I turn it I loved it very tour 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:29.160
 well it's a pretty smooth twist that 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:31.860
 fascinates simply is very very fast 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.150
 but there is not a bit noisy really yes 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.910
 it's very soft I think it's too much 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.500
 loose but still I still think that my 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.190
 opinion is that it is a very good turn 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.780
 fast smooth but excessively loose 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.750
 maybe too fast hard to 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.500
 control over the cut corners 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.420
 it is a fairly high court as seen 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.350
 does not have any problem in cutting 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:59.370
 the line with line 45 degrees what does 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:03.760
 more then more can no longer but put that 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:06.189
 the classic 45 degrees makes them 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:10.590
 45 degrees that you do not care is that this 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:12.970
 cube 45 degrees and that this cube well 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.960
 about the reverse cut as medium 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.860
 little squared you have done it more 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.020
 technically to two thirds 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.600
 like most of the cubes for the 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.360
 speed I just recommend it 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.560
 quite on the subject of contrast 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.030
 I asked for it in the version 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.369
 stickers and the ethical version is it has 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.530
 very nice colors I like a lot 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.049
 the colors are easy to distinguish and 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.650
 Do not bother the view are the colors very 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:39.290
 good ones 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.190
 about the pieces the pieces have a 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:45.140
 very basic design I was surprised because 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:49.660
 look at them remove the corners the corners 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.660
 They are here as they see 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.170
 this is a very basic design here I have 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.780
 the corner of a diane sanchis and how 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.420
 come is quite different and as you see 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.070
 this cube is simple but simply 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:07.950
 very good the edges the edges 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:10.500
 they look like those of an original rubik 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.860
 modified with torpedo that's what it gives 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:19.720
 understand and excuse me 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:24.900
 ok some edges because you see here a 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:27.930
 torpedo this kind of thing here 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.180
 and well they are at the time of being 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.030
 together they go like this 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.790
 as you can see the torpedo hooks very well 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.090
 corner and that's a very good advantage 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.090
 why 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:45.620
 this because it does not do little on the subject 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.490
 of the town let's talk now a 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:53.090
 force in this cube to line with line 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:54.530
 reverse cut and does not do to dedicate me 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:59.800
 that I am giving him with all my strength 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.800
 and it does not port is a pretty good cube 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:06.540
 it's worth on the subject d 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:10.019
 this cube on the subject of the turn of 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.629
 corner as you know the juices go to 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:15.269
 the corners then to this to this cube 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:17.930
 Well, if I did the corners, 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.930
 as you see 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.970
 no it is not a cube like the panchillo 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.890
 AndrÃ© version 1 that read the corners 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.500
 without problems this cube with that cube no 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.230
 you're going to have problems in the turns of the 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.970
 layer of m are pretty good is the cube 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.910
 with the turns of the layer m 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:41.620
 better than I had simply 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:43.650
 on the subject of hamas on the subject of 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.110
 get stuck this cube never gets stuck 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:52.950
 as good I want at very high speed and 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.950
 that does not get stuck was never very good 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.849
 you see is a super fast nest 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:03.920
 monstrously fast and does not get stuck 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:06.230
 this is due to the aforementioned 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.480
 very high corner cut as you see 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:12.540
 almost line with inverse slope line and 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:16.670
 more than 45 degrees direct cut 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:20.990
 now maybe he does not do it and well 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:24.470
 so let's do the rest, let's do 

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:27.830
 sorry the summary of the cube the cube 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:30.530
 it simply rotates very very well it rotates 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:33.230
 pretty fast I really like it is a 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.330
 spin very fast and very loose but such 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:38.270
 time a little loose but still not 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.670
 puts does not do for ever for more than 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.920
 strong the corner cut is a cut 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:47.480
 fairly good elevated corner 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:50.020
 both inverse and direct and that makes 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.020
 that never 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:05:00.639
 never lock as you see looks very very 

00:04:57.209 --> 00:05:02.710
 well and it's a cheap cube 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:05.580
 it's just a very relatively cube 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.810
 cheap and I highly recommend it 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:11.069
 thank you very much I hope you like it 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.069
