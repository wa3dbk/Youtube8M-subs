00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
and here is an update for switches on

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.269 
and here is an update for switches on
the<00:00:03.840> fours<00:00:04.110> a<00:00:04.290> driver<00:00:04.620> we<00:00:04.830> got<00:00:04.980> some<00:00:05.160> new

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
the fours a driver we got some new

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.990 
the fours a driver we got some new
switches<00:00:05.640> here<00:00:05.819> now<00:00:06.000> and<00:00:07.010> as<00:00:08.010> you<00:00:08.130> can<00:00:08.220> see<00:00:08.280> the

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
switches here now and as you can see the

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.039 
switches here now and as you can see the
meteor<00:00:09.179> switch<00:00:09.599> from<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.290> meteor<00:00:11.120> driver<00:00:12.120> the

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
meteor switch from the meteor driver the

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.870 
meteor switch from the meteor driver the
stealth<00:00:13.320> switch<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.280> hammer<00:00:14.490> switch

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
stealth switch and the hammer switch

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.050 
stealth switch and the hammer switch
from<00:00:15.330> Astro<00:00:15.719> set<00:00:16.020> for<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:17.250> water<00:00:17.490> switch<00:00:17.820> from

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
from Astro set for the water switch from

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.730 
from Astro set for the water switch from
the<00:00:18.210> gashapons<00:00:18.570> set<00:00:18.960> of<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.140> forints<00:00:19.410> we're

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
the gashapons set of the forints we're

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.109 
the gashapons set of the forints we're
also<00:00:19.890> going<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.160> show<00:00:20.310> off<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.550> winch<00:00:20.789> switch

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
also going to show off the winch switch

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.480 
also going to show off the winch switch
here<00:00:21.420> but<00:00:21.600> it's<00:00:21.869> also<00:00:22.080> goes<00:00:22.439> on<00:00:22.560> that<00:00:22.740> slot<00:00:22.949> so

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
here but it's also goes on that slot so

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.040 
here but it's also goes on that slot so
we<00:00:23.580> can't<00:00:23.760> put<00:00:23.910> them<00:00:23.970> all<00:00:24.090> in<00:00:24.150> there<00:00:24.269> once<00:00:24.480> but

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
we can't put them all in there once but

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.540 
we can't put them all in there once but
so<00:00:25.199> we'll<00:00:25.320> go<00:00:25.410> ahead<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.650> turn<00:00:26.099> on<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.310> driver

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
so we'll go ahead and turn on the driver

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.640 
so we'll go ahead and turn on the driver
other<00:00:26.820> drivers<00:00:27.180> already<00:00:27.269> gone<00:00:27.480> okay<00:00:27.869> so<00:00:28.410> we'll

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
other drivers already gone okay so we'll

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:37.569 
other drivers already gone okay so we'll
go<00:00:28.769> ahead<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:30.949> transform<00:00:31.949> with<00:00:32.160> these<00:00:34.489> meteo

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:01:01.340 

stills<00:00:40.670> wah<00:00:59.480> now<00:01:00.480> you'll<00:01:00.690> notice<00:01:00.870> he's<00:01:01.050> still

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
stills wah now you'll notice he's still

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.020 
stills wah now you'll notice he's still
white<00:01:01.800> like<00:01:02.010> when<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.219> put<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.550> fire<00:01:02.789> he

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
white like when you put in the fire he

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.729 
white like when you put in the fire he
turns<00:01:03.239> yellow<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.780> red<00:01:03.960> he<00:01:04.110> turns<00:01:04.350> right<00:01:04.619> or

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
turns yellow the red he turns right or

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.350 
turns yellow the red he turns right or
the<00:01:05.159> fire<00:01:05.400> he<00:01:05.549> turns<00:01:05.760> red<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.060> alecky

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
the fire he turns red the alecky

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.649 
the fire he turns red the alecky
turns<00:01:06.570> yellow<00:01:07.790> he<00:01:08.790> doesn't<00:01:09.090> change<00:01:09.330> for

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
turns yellow he doesn't change for

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.710 
turns yellow he doesn't change for
meteor<00:01:09.960> like<00:01:10.140> he<00:01:10.260> recognizes<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.189> switch<00:01:11.720> in

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
meteor like he recognizes the switch in

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.380 
meteor like he recognizes the switch in
the<00:01:12.780> same<00:01:13.080> way<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:14.060> well<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.119> guess<00:01:15.150> that

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
the same way that well I guess that

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.030 
the same way that well I guess that
one's<00:01:15.540> designed<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.200> use<00:01:16.350> fire<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:16.830> maybe

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
one's designed to use fire so maybe

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.550 
one's designed to use fire so maybe
maybe<00:01:17.280> meteor<00:01:17.790> will<00:01:18.000> use<00:01:18.210> fire<00:01:18.509> in<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.409> like

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
maybe meteor will use fire in the like

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.780 
maybe meteor will use fire in the like
switches<00:01:19.950> at<00:01:20.159> some<00:01:20.310> point<00:01:20.520> during<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.729> show

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
switches at some point during the show

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.730 
switches at some point during the show
but<00:01:21.390> for<00:01:21.540> say<00:01:21.720> does<00:01:21.869> not<00:01:21.900> have<00:01:22.200> like<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.350> meteor

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
but for say does not have like a meteor

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.630 
but for say does not have like a meteor
States<00:01:23.009> as<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.420> it<00:01:24.420> appears<00:01:25.310> you<00:01:26.310> can<00:01:26.340> put<00:01:26.549> the

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
States as a it appears you can put the

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.770 
States as a it appears you can put the
switch<00:01:26.880> in<00:01:26.909> but<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.270> doesn't<00:01:27.509> seem<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.689> affect

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
switch in but it doesn't seem to affect

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.480 
switch in but it doesn't seem to affect
his<00:01:28.320> body<00:01:28.530> even<00:01:28.650> though<00:01:28.860> there<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.100> blue<00:01:29.340> LED

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
his body even though there is a blue LED

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.740 
his body even though there is a blue LED
in<00:01:29.880> there<00:01:30.030> when<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.049> turn<00:01:31.200> one<00:01:35.750> there's

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
in there when you turn one there's

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.170 
in there when you turn one there's
meteor<00:01:37.310> and<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.400> could<00:01:38.549> do<00:01:38.670> Limit<00:01:38.970> Breaks

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
meteor and I could do Limit Breaks

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.310 
meteor and I could do Limit Breaks
because<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.479> just<00:01:39.630> repeats<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:40.170> with<00:01:40.290> a

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
because it just repeats that with a

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.130 
because it just repeats that with a
limit<00:01:40.590> breaking<00:01:40.950> I'm<00:01:41.130> his<00:01:44.960> stealth<00:01:45.960> just

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
limit breaking I'm his stealth just

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.710 
limit breaking I'm his stealth just
gives<00:01:46.320> him<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.500> little<00:01:47.149> design<00:01:48.149> down<00:01:48.479> here<00:01:48.630> on

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
gives him a little design down here on

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.030 
gives him a little design down here on
his<00:01:48.810> leg<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.229> makes<00:01:49.350> him<00:01:49.470> invisible<00:01:49.680> for<00:01:50.009> a

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
his leg and makes him invisible for a

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.850 
his leg and makes him invisible for a
few<00:01:50.220> seconds<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:51.259> water<00:01:52.259> gives<00:01:52.530> him<00:01:52.710> like<00:01:52.829> a

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
few seconds a water gives him like a

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.850 
few seconds a water gives him like a
spray<00:01:53.280> nozzle<00:01:53.310> on<00:01:54.030> his<00:01:54.149> leg

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.410 

and<00:02:00.860> then<00:02:01.190> hammer<00:02:01.370> just<00:02:01.670> gives<00:02:02.150> me<00:02:02.240> a<00:02:02.270> giant

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
and then hammer just gives me a giant

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:12.160 
and then hammer just gives me a giant
hammer<00:02:10.390> there<00:02:11.390> you<00:02:11.480> go<00:02:11.540> hon<00:02:11.720> oh<00:02:11.870> why<00:02:11.990> that

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
hammer there you go hon oh why that

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.890 
hammer there you go hon oh why that
didn't<00:02:12.440> activate<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.340> first<00:02:13.490> time<00:02:13.900> so

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
didn't activate the first time so

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.150 
didn't activate the first time so
there's<00:02:15.050> hammer<00:02:15.260> and<00:02:15.530> then<00:02:15.680> we'll<00:02:15.800> do<00:02:15.950> a<00:02:15.980> winch

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
there's hammer and then we'll do a winch

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:25.180 
there's hammer and then we'll do a winch
real<00:02:16.370> quick<00:02:23.350> and<00:02:24.350> I<00:02:24.470> gives<00:02:24.710> him<00:02:24.860> like<00:02:25.010> hey<00:02:25.160> I

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
real quick and I gives him like hey I

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.800 
real quick and I gives him like hey I
said<00:02:25.340> exactly<00:02:26.000> would<00:02:26.060> you<00:02:26.180> expect<00:02:26.480> a<00:02:26.630> big

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
said exactly would you expect a big

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.440 
said exactly would you expect a big
winch<00:02:27.110> and<00:02:27.290> reel<00:02:27.560> on<00:02:27.890> his<00:02:28.490> hand<00:02:28.730> to<00:02:28.880> catch<00:02:29.210> bad

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
winch and reel on his hand to catch bad

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.449 
winch and reel on his hand to catch bad
guys<00:02:29.480> and<00:02:29.930> reel<00:02:30.050> them<00:02:30.080> in<00:02:30.290> so<00:02:31.160> those<00:02:31.280> are<00:02:31.400> the

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
guys and reel them in so those are the

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.840 
guys and reel them in so those are the
new<00:02:31.580> switches<00:02:33.070> was<00:02:34.070> it<00:02:34.190> five<00:02:34.400> new<00:02:34.610> switches

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
new switches was it five new switches
