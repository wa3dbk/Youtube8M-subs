00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
see here this case is two pieces okay we

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.050 
see here this case is two pieces okay we
have<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:37.979> main<00:01:38.100> case<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.520> we<00:01:38.610> have<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
have the main case and we have the

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.090 
have the main case and we have the
sensor<00:01:39.390> that's<00:01:39.540> built<00:01:39.750> into<00:01:39.900> here<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:40.320> this<00:01:41.009> is

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
sensor that's built into here so this is

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.219 
sensor that's built into here so this is
where<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.430> need<00:01:41.640> in<00:01:42.000> order<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.329> charge<00:01:42.899> up

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:14.499 
nectar is being blocked off because you

00:02:14.499 --> 00:02:16.110 
nectar is being blocked off because you
have<00:02:14.650> this<00:02:14.739> other<00:02:14.890> piece<00:02:15.099> right<00:02:15.219> here<00:02:15.280> do<00:02:15.999> they

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
have this other piece right here do they

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.149 
have this other piece right here do they
have<00:02:16.269> a<00:02:16.299> headphone<00:02:16.689> port<00:02:17.439> it<00:02:17.650> like<00:02:17.799> I<00:02:17.889> said<00:02:17.950> it

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:18.159 
have a headphone port it like I said it

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:19.649 
have a headphone port it like I said it
is<00:02:18.249> kind<00:02:18.609> of<00:02:18.700> deep<00:02:18.909> so<00:02:19.090> you'll<00:02:19.239> have<00:02:19.359> to<00:02:19.480> use<00:02:19.510> an

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:19.659 
is kind of deep so you'll have to use an

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:20.729 
is kind of deep so you'll have to use an
adapter<00:02:20.019> if<00:02:20.079> you<00:02:20.139> don't<00:02:20.319> have<00:02:20.439> a<00:02:20.469> pair<00:02:20.709> of

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
adapter if you don't have a pair of

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:21.809 
adapter if you don't have a pair of
headphones<00:02:20.829> that<00:02:21.129> will<00:02:21.219> fit<00:02:21.400> there<00:02:21.549> nicely

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
headphones that will fit there nicely

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.000 
headphones that will fit there nicely
the<00:02:22.569> microphone<00:02:23.049> is<00:02:23.290> kind<00:02:23.620> of<00:02:23.650> being<00:02:23.769> blocked

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
the microphone is kind of being blocked

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.649 
the microphone is kind of being blocked
but<00:02:24.159> it<00:02:24.249> does<00:02:24.400> have<00:02:24.549> a<00:02:24.579> slight<00:02:24.849> slit<00:02:25.540> right

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:25.659 
but it does have a slight slit right

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.209 
but it does have a slight slit right
there<00:02:25.840> so<00:02:25.959> you<00:02:26.019> can<00:02:26.170> still<00:02:26.349> the<00:02:26.859> this

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:27.219 
there so you can still the this

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:28.379 
there so you can still the this
shouldn't<00:02:27.430> have<00:02:27.549> any<00:02:27.730> issues<00:02:27.819> hearing<00:02:28.269> and

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:28.389 
shouldn't have any issues hearing and

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:29.580 
shouldn't have any issues hearing and
there's<00:02:28.569> also<00:02:28.689> a<00:02:28.810> slit<00:02:29.049> in<00:02:29.109> the<00:02:29.170> front<00:02:29.349> as<00:02:29.469> well

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
there's also a slit in the front as well

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.770 
there's also a slit in the front as well
right<00:02:30.010> there<00:02:30.189> so<00:02:30.909> then<00:02:31.060> also<00:02:31.269> obviously<00:02:31.719> the

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
right there so then also obviously the

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:32.819 
right there so then also obviously the
Lightning<00:02:32.019> connector<00:02:32.079> is<00:02:32.290> blocked<00:02:32.500> off<00:02:32.650> and

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:32.829 
Lightning connector is blocked off and

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:34.619 
Lightning connector is blocked off and
then<00:02:32.920> we<00:02:33.010> have<00:02:33.159> the<00:02:33.310> microphone<00:02:34.000> are<00:02:34.359> that<00:02:34.540> the

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629 
then we have the microphone are that the

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:36.449 
then we have the microphone are that the
speaker<00:02:34.930> coming<00:02:35.620> from<00:02:35.769> there<00:02:35.950> and<00:02:36.219> from<00:02:36.310> the

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
speaker coming from there and from the

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.220 
speaker coming from there and from the
front<00:02:36.670> I<00:02:36.879> didn't<00:02:37.420> notice<00:02:37.569> that<00:02:37.599> the<00:02:37.870> audio<00:02:37.989> on

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
front I didn't notice that the audio on

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.629 
front I didn't notice that the audio on
the<00:02:38.290> speaker<00:02:38.560> is<00:02:38.650> affected<00:02:39.040> a<00:02:39.129> little<00:02:39.250> bit<00:02:39.489> so

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:39.639 
the speaker is affected a little bit so

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:40.949 
the speaker is affected a little bit so
you<00:02:39.700> still<00:02:40.000> have<00:02:40.120> to<00:02:40.180> kind<00:02:40.329> of<00:02:40.359> cup<00:02:40.540> it<00:02:40.689> to<00:02:40.810> get

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
you still have to kind of cup it to get

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.390 
you still have to kind of cup it to get

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:43.749 
it was just pointed that way and it was

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:45.720 
it was just pointed that way and it was
blocked<00:02:43.989> off<00:02:44.169> like<00:02:44.379> this<00:02:44.530> that<00:02:44.769> way<00:02:44.889> when<00:02:45.639> you

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730

there's<00:02:50.739> no<00:02:50.859> real<00:02:51.849> big<00:02:52.090> issues<00:02:52.389> with<00:02:52.510> that

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:52.689 
there's no real big issues with that

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:54.569

preference<00:02:54.849> in<00:02:54.969> this<00:02:55.120> there<00:02:55.329> so<00:02:55.959> when<00:02:56.049> you<00:02:56.079> get

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:56.199 
preference in this there so when you get

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:57.179 
preference in this there so when you get
to<00:02:56.290> this<00:02:56.349> other<00:02:56.439> case<00:02:56.650> we<00:02:56.799> do<00:02:56.889> have<00:02:57.010> a<00:02:57.040> lot<00:02:57.159> on

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:57.189 
to this other case we do have a lot on

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:59.129 
to this other case we do have a lot on
the<00:02:57.280> table<00:02:57.430> design<00:02:57.730> I<00:02:58.209> do<00:02:58.599> have<00:02:58.870> a<00:02:58.900> glass

00:02:59.129 --> 00:02:59.139 
the table design I do have a glass

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:00.569 
the table design I do have a glass
screen<00:02:59.290> shield<00:02:59.680> on<00:02:59.799> my<00:02:59.889> phone<00:03:00.099> so<00:03:00.310> it<00:03:00.400> does

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
screen shield on my phone so it does

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:02.009 
screen shield on my phone so it does
make<00:03:00.849> the<00:03:01.120> screen<00:03:01.329> look<00:03:01.480> like<00:03:01.599> it's<00:03:01.719> closer<00:03:01.930> to

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
make the screen look like it's closer to

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.659 
make the screen look like it's closer to
the<00:03:02.230> edge<00:03:02.379> but<00:03:02.620> what<00:03:02.739> if<00:03:02.859> you<00:03:03.280> didn't<00:03:03.489> have<00:03:03.639> a

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:03.669 
the edge but what if you didn't have a

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:05.670 
the edge but what if you didn't have a
thick<00:03:03.939> screen<00:03:04.329> shield<00:03:04.510> like<00:03:04.689> I<00:03:04.810> do<00:03:04.870> you<00:03:05.560> would

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
thick screen shield like I do you would

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.780 
thick screen shield like I do you would
be<00:03:05.739> able<00:03:05.829> to<00:03:05.919> see<00:03:06.040> it<00:03:06.099> as<00:03:06.250> much<00:03:06.370> there's<00:03:06.760> a

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
be able to see it as much there's a

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:07.949 
be able to see it as much there's a
pretty<00:03:06.969> good<00:03:07.060> edge<00:03:07.209> on<00:03:07.359> the<00:03:07.449> phone<00:03:07.629> so<00:03:07.780> if<00:03:07.870> it

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
pretty good edge on the phone so if it

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.599 
pretty good edge on the phone so if it
does<00:03:08.139> fall<00:03:08.709> facedown<00:03:09.159> it's<00:03:09.340> not<00:03:09.459> to<00:03:09.519> be

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
does fall facedown it's not to be

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:11.339 
does fall facedown it's not to be
touching<00:03:09.879> the<00:03:09.939> glass<00:03:10.060> of<00:03:10.389> the<00:03:10.419> iPhone<00:03:10.810> okay

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
touching the glass of the iPhone okay

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:13.800 
touching the glass of the iPhone okay
and<00:03:12.310> as<00:03:12.549> you<00:03:12.639> can<00:03:12.760> see<00:03:12.879> nothing<00:03:13.480> else<00:03:13.599> is<00:03:13.719> being

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.429 
we have a nice big opening for the
camera<00:03:18.909> and<00:03:19.180> the<00:03:19.329> flash<00:03:19.449> does<00:03:19.780> not<00:03:20.019> bounce<00:03:20.229> off

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:20.439 
camera and the flash does not bounce off

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:22.589 
camera and the flash does not bounce off
the<00:03:21.099> edge<00:03:21.189> right<00:03:21.340> there<00:03:21.549> we<00:03:22.090> have<00:03:22.180> a<00:03:22.299> nice<00:03:22.419> cool

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 
the edge right there we have a nice cool

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:24.809 
the edge right there we have a nice cool
cool<00:03:22.840> textured<00:03:23.229> design<00:03:23.259> so<00:03:23.769> it<00:03:23.829> makes<00:03:24.549> it<00:03:24.699> a

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
cool textured design so it makes it a

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:26.069 
cool textured design so it makes it a
little<00:03:24.970> bit<00:03:25.090> easier<00:03:25.299> to<00:03:25.419> grip<00:03:25.599> in<00:03:25.750> your<00:03:25.870> hand

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
little bit easier to grip in your hand

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:27.629 
little bit easier to grip in your hand
which<00:03:26.229> is<00:03:26.319> kind<00:03:26.530> of<00:03:26.560> nice<00:03:26.680> and<00:03:26.949> so<00:03:27.430> here<00:03:27.579> we

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:27.639 
which is kind of nice and so here we

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:29.009 
which is kind of nice and so here we
have<00:03:27.759> the<00:03:27.849> sensor<00:03:28.120> on<00:03:28.209> the<00:03:28.239> back<00:03:28.389> okay<00:03:28.750> so<00:03:28.810> like

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
have the sensor on the back okay so like

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:30.300 
have the sensor on the back okay so like
I<00:03:29.109> said<00:03:29.169> this<00:03:29.379> is<00:03:29.530> the<00:03:29.620> sensor<00:03:29.889> that<00:03:30.009> uses

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
I said this is the sensor that uses

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.879 
I said this is the sensor that uses
that's<00:03:31.150> used<00:03:31.359> with<00:03:31.479> the<00:03:31.599> pad<00:03:31.780> to<00:03:32.560> charge<00:03:32.799> of

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
that's used with the pad to charge of

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:34.379 
that's used with the pad to charge of
the<00:03:32.979> device<00:03:33.159> so<00:03:33.310> without<00:03:33.669> this<00:03:33.879> right<00:03:34.180> here

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:34.389 
the device so without this right here

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:35.849 
the device so without this right here
you<00:03:34.540> cannot<00:03:34.780> charge<00:03:35.139> up<00:03:35.349> your<00:03:35.379> phone

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:35.859 
you cannot charge up your phone

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:38.099 
you cannot charge up your phone
wirelessly<00:03:36.280> one<00:03:37.239> thing<00:03:37.389> I<00:03:37.479> kind<00:03:37.870> of<00:03:37.900> like<00:03:38.019> the

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
wirelessly one thing I kind of like the

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:40.069 
wirelessly one thing I kind of like the
way<00:03:38.199> this<00:03:38.799> works<00:03:39.040> those<00:03:39.310> ideas<00:03:39.639> you<00:03:39.729> can<00:03:39.849> see

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
way this works those ideas you can see

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.119 
way this works those ideas you can see
and<00:03:41.079> also<00:03:41.409> if<00:03:41.500> you<00:03:41.560> don't<00:03:41.680> have<00:03:41.769> the<00:03:41.859> pad<00:03:41.979> with

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:42.129 
and also if you don't have the pad with

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:43.679 
and also if you don't have the pad with
you<00:03:42.250> can<00:03:42.400> always<00:03:42.459> use<00:03:42.729> the<00:03:42.849> micro<00:03:43.060> USB<00:03:43.120> to

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:43.689 
you can always use the micro USB to

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:44.999 
you can always use the micro USB to
charge<00:03:43.720> it<00:03:44.079> just<00:03:44.439> through<00:03:44.560> the<00:03:44.650> bottom<00:03:44.919> right

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:45.009 
charge it just through the bottom right

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:46.469 
charge it just through the bottom right
here<00:03:45.069> which<00:03:45.250> is<00:03:45.340> which<00:03:46.000> is<00:03:46.150> kind<00:03:46.359> of<00:03:46.389> nice

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:46.479 
here which is which is kind of nice

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:47.610 
here which is which is kind of nice
considering<00:03:46.959> I<00:03:47.109> don't<00:03:47.290> have<00:03:47.409> that<00:03:47.500> many

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
considering I don't have that many

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.050 
considering I don't have that many
lightning<00:03:47.889> connectors<00:03:48.310> but<00:03:48.400> I<00:03:48.459> have<00:03:48.609> tons<00:03:48.879> of

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
lightning connectors but I have tons of

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.780 
lightning connectors but I have tons of
micro<00:03:49.359> USB<00:03:49.720> cords<00:03:50.439> all<00:03:50.530> over<00:03:50.709> the<00:03:50.799> place<00:03:50.979> so<00:03:51.189> if

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
micro USB cords all over the place so if

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.069 
micro USB cords all over the place so if
I<00:03:51.879> want<00:03:52.030> to<00:03:52.090> I<00:03:52.180> could<00:03:52.269> just<00:03:52.329> pop<00:03:52.599> that<00:03:52.629> in<00:03:52.930> there

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
I want to I could just pop that in there

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.170 
don't have my micro USB but I do have a
lightning<00:03:56.889> connector<00:03:57.129> you<00:03:57.729> can<00:03:57.790> pop<00:03:58.000> it<00:03:58.120> off

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
lightning connector you can pop it off

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.339 
lightning connector you can pop it off
and<00:03:58.209> you<00:03:58.359> can<00:03:58.449> still<00:03:58.629> charge<00:03:58.810> it<00:03:58.989> you<00:03:59.229> can

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
and you can still charge it you can

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:01.080 
and you can still charge it you can
still<00:03:59.530> sync<00:03:59.739> and<00:03:59.889> charge<00:03:59.919> it<00:04:00.250> with<00:04:00.909> your

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
still sync and charge it with your

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.129 
still sync and charge it with your
lightning<00:04:01.299> connector<00:04:01.569> through<00:04:01.810> the<00:04:01.900> bottom

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:02.139 
lightning connector through the bottom

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:03.209 
lightning connector through the bottom
because<00:04:02.229> it<00:04:02.379> still<00:04:02.620> gives<00:04:02.799> you<00:04:02.889> access<00:04:03.069> to

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:03.219 
because it still gives you access to

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:05.459 
because it still gives you access to
that<00:04:03.430> so<00:04:03.579> that's<00:04:03.819> pretty<00:04:03.939> nice<00:04:04.269> keep<00:04:05.199> in<00:04:05.319> mind

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:05.469 
that so that's pretty nice keep in mind

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:08.099 
that so that's pretty nice keep in mind
this<00:04:05.560> is<00:04:05.709> only<00:04:05.739> gonna<00:04:06.129> charge<00:04:06.719> using<00:04:07.719> this<00:04:07.959> the

this is only gonna charge using this the

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:09.779 
this is only gonna charge using this the
Qi<00:04:08.290> charge<00:04:08.500> is<00:04:08.590> only<00:04:08.709> gonna<00:04:08.829> charge<00:04:09.159> the

00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:09.789 
Qi charge is only gonna charge the

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:11.309 
Qi charge is only gonna charge the
device<00:04:10.180> it's<00:04:10.389> not<00:04:10.509> allow<00:04:10.750> you<00:04:10.810> to<00:04:11.049> sync

device it's not allow you to sync

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:12.809 
device it's not allow you to sync
wirelessly<00:04:11.500> you<00:04:11.889> still<00:04:12.099> have<00:04:12.219> to<00:04:12.310> plug<00:04:12.579> it<00:04:12.699> in

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
wirelessly you still have to plug it in

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.129 
wirelessly you still have to plug it in
in<00:04:13.239> order<00:04:13.299> to<00:04:13.449> sync<00:04:13.750> you<00:04:13.840> can<00:04:13.959> plug<00:04:14.079> them

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
in order to sync you can plug them

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:15.929 
in order to sync you can plug them
through<00:04:14.289> the<00:04:14.349> micro<00:04:14.500> USB<00:04:14.560> 2<00:04:15.189> to<00:04:15.430> sync<00:04:15.669> it<00:04:15.729> but

00:04:15.929 --> 00:04:15.939 
through the micro USB 2 to sync it but

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:18.810 
through the micro USB 2 to sync it but
you<00:04:16.030> can<00:04:16.180> do<00:04:16.299> it<00:04:16.389> wirelessly<00:04:16.570> okay<00:04:17.609> so<00:04:18.609> overall

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
you can do it wirelessly okay so overall

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.219 
you can do it wirelessly okay so overall
the<00:04:18.940> case<00:04:19.120> is<00:04:19.269> really<00:04:19.419> nice<00:04:19.630> I<00:04:19.780> think<00:04:19.989> it<00:04:20.079> has<00:04:20.199> a

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
the case is really nice I think it has a

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:23.339 
the case is really nice I think it has a
nice<00:04:20.680> little<00:04:20.979> nice<00:04:21.729> rugged<00:04:22.029> type<00:04:22.570> of<00:04:22.779> texture

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:23.349 
nice little nice rugged type of texture

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:25.230 
nice little nice rugged type of texture
to<00:04:23.380> the<00:04:23.560> back<00:04:23.770> I<00:04:24.039> think<00:04:24.460> the<00:04:24.610> probably<00:04:25.060> does<00:04:25.180> a

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
to the back I think the probably does a

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.940 
to the back I think the probably does a
really<00:04:25.360> good<00:04:25.479> job<00:04:25.539> of<00:04:25.719> protecting

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
really good job of protecting

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.470 
really good job of protecting
I<00:04:26.980> will<00:04:27.310> mention<00:04:27.490> that<00:04:27.700> most<00:04:28.210> of<00:04:28.330> time<00:04:28.450> you

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
I will mention that most of time you

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.180 
I will mention that most of time you
should<00:04:28.840> have<00:04:28.870> no<00:04:29.110> issues<00:04:29.350> charging<00:04:29.950> us<00:04:30.040> and

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
should have no issues charging us and

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.520 
should have no issues charging us and
this<00:04:30.310> isn't<00:04:30.490> a<00:04:30.610> device<00:04:30.880> that<00:04:31.150> is<00:04:31.360> it<00:04:32.140> is<00:04:32.290> made

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
this isn't a device that is it is made

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.290 
this isn't a device that is it is made
for<00:04:32.800> iPhone<00:04:32.920> so<00:04:33.340> it<00:04:33.460> has<00:04:33.550> been<00:04:33.790> that<00:04:33.940> and<00:04:34.150> this

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
for iPhone so it has been that and this

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.180 
for iPhone so it has been that and this
has<00:04:34.450> a<00:04:34.480> certification<00:04:34.840> but<00:04:35.800> I<00:04:35.830> have<00:04:36.010> noticed

guess<00:05:13.630> dealing<00:05:14.080> with<00:05:14.170> that<00:05:14.290> so<00:05:14.410> it<00:05:14.500> may<00:05:14.590> not

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
guess dealing with that so it may not

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.320 
guess dealing with that so it may not
even<00:05:14.800> be<00:05:15.040> an<00:05:15.340> issue<00:05:15.430> for<00:05:15.550> you<00:05:15.760> guys<00:05:15.910> at<00:05:16.030> all<00:05:16.150> but

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
good to go for charging here's another

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.890 
good to go for charging here's another
cool<00:05:38.980> thing<00:05:39.040> though<00:05:39.250> that<00:05:39.280> that<00:05:39.730> dog<00:05:39.940> and<00:05:40.240> bone

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900 
cool thing though that that dog and bone

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.080 
cool thing though that that dog and bone
have<00:05:41.230> released<00:05:41.830> though<00:05:42.010> for<00:05:42.550> additional<00:05:42.820> 50

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
have released though for additional 50

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.900 
have released though for additional 50
bucks<00:05:43.410> you<00:05:44.410> can<00:05:44.530> have<00:05:44.680> a<00:05:44.710> battery<00:05:45.070> pack<00:05:45.250> okay

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:45.910 
bucks you can have a battery pack okay

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:47.610 
bucks you can have a battery pack okay
and<00:05:46.210> so<00:05:46.450> this<00:05:46.600> will<00:05:46.690> actually<00:05:46.990> fit<00:05:47.230> in<00:05:47.440> the

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
and so this will actually fit in the

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.580 
and so this will actually fit in the
back<00:05:47.770> of<00:05:47.950> your<00:05:48.040> phone<00:05:48.420> right<00:05:49.420> here<00:05:49.630> slightly

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
back of your phone right here slightly

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.390 
back of your phone right here slightly
thicker<00:05:52.530> see<00:05:53.530> when<00:05:53.710> you<00:05:53.770> pop<00:05:53.920> it<00:05:53.950> in<00:05:54.130> there

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 
thicker see when you pop it in there

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.890 
thicker see when you pop it in there
there's<00:05:54.640> the<00:05:54.850> charge<00:05:55.060> in<00:05:55.180> my<00:05:55.210> device<00:05:55.510> so<00:05:55.750> it's

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:55.900 
there's the charge in my device so it's

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.600 
there's the charge in my device so it's
slightly<00:05:56.050> thicker<00:05:56.350> and<00:05:56.740> I<00:05:57.190> believe<00:05:57.430> this<00:05:57.490> is

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
slightly thicker and I believe this is

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.850 
slightly thicker and I believe this is
only<00:05:57.730> about<00:05:57.880> nine<00:05:58.150> hundred<00:05:58.180> milliamps<00:05:58.690> so<00:05:59.620> we

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
only about nine hundred milliamps so we

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.230 
only about nine hundred milliamps so we
will<00:06:00.010> not<00:06:00.130> give<00:06:00.310> your<00:06:00.430> phone<00:06:00.670> a<00:06:00.700> full<00:06:00.970> charge

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
will not give your phone a full charge

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.630 
will not give your phone a full charge
but<00:06:01.330> if<00:06:01.540> your<00:06:01.630> phone's<00:06:01.840> about<00:06:02.100> 50%<00:06:03.100> maybe<00:06:03.190> 60%

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:03.640 
but if your phone's about 50% maybe 60%

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.250 
but if your phone's about 50% maybe 60%
it<00:06:04.270> should<00:06:04.600> charge<00:06:04.780> it<00:06:04.900> up<00:06:04.990> all<00:06:05.110> the<00:06:05.140> way<00:06:05.200> to

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:05.260 
it should charge it up all the way to

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.080 
it should charge it up all the way to
100%<00:06:05.650> and<00:06:06.160> it<00:06:06.250> does<00:06:06.400> it<00:06:06.520> pretty<00:06:06.640> quickly<00:06:06.880> as

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 
100% and it does it pretty quickly as

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:08.130 
100% and it does it pretty quickly as
well<00:06:07.240> but<00:06:07.330> it<00:06:07.450> still<00:06:07.660> gives<00:06:07.750> you<00:06:07.840> the<00:06:07.900> access

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:08.140 
well but it still gives you the access

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.420 
well but it still gives you the access
to<00:06:08.380> the<00:06:08.470> poor<00:06:08.650> and<00:06:08.740> the<00:06:08.800> mic<00:06:08.920> USB<00:06:09.250> on<00:06:09.400> the

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:09.430 
to the poor and the mic USB on the

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:10.830 
to the poor and the mic USB on the
bottom<00:06:09.730> and<00:06:10.150> it<00:06:10.390> fits<00:06:10.540> right<00:06:10.630> in<00:06:10.750> there

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840 
bottom and it fits right in there

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.260 
bottom and it fits right in there
perfectly<00:06:11.200> so<00:06:12.190> it's<00:06:12.280> kinda<00:06:12.460> nice<00:06:12.550> I<00:06:12.700> think<00:06:12.760> it

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270 
perfectly so it's kinda nice I think it

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.060 
perfectly so it's kinda nice I think it
would<00:06:13.390> be<00:06:13.510> kind<00:06:13.630> of<00:06:13.720> cool<00:06:13.930> is<00:06:14.200> if<00:06:14.620> this<00:06:14.800> bill

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.070 
would be kind of cool is if this bill

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:16.830 
would be kind of cool is if this bill
had<00:06:15.250> a<00:06:15.280> built-in<00:06:15.640> Qi<00:06:15.880> charger<00:06:16.270> sensor<00:06:16.600> inside

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
had a built-in Qi charger sensor inside

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.740 
had a built-in Qi charger sensor inside
here<00:06:17.080> and<00:06:17.260> if<00:06:17.380> this<00:06:17.530> had<00:06:17.710> like<00:06:18.190> a<00:06:18.220> dipped<00:06:18.550> in

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750 
here and if this had like a dipped in

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.610 
here and if this had like a dipped in
cutaways<00:06:19.750> where<00:06:19.960> you<00:06:20.080> could<00:06:20.200> still<00:06:20.410> use<00:06:20.440> it

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:20.620 
cutaways where you could still use it

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.110 
cutaways where you could still use it
pop<00:06:21.190> it<00:06:21.340> in<00:06:21.430> that<00:06:21.520> you<00:06:21.610> could<00:06:21.730> charge<00:06:21.970> up<00:06:22.090> your

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120 
pop it in that you could charge up your

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.820 
pop it in that you could charge up your
battery<00:06:22.480> or<00:06:22.540> your<00:06:22.630> phone<00:06:22.810> at<00:06:23.290> the<00:06:23.440> same<00:06:23.560> time

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.740 
battery or your phone at the same time
that<00:06:24.040> might<00:06:24.130> be<00:06:24.220> kind<00:06:24.400> of<00:06:24.430> cool<00:06:24.490> but<00:06:25.240> as<00:06:25.540> far<00:06:25.720> as

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:25.750 
that might be kind of cool but as far as

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.090 
that might be kind of cool but as far as
charging<00:06:26.290> this<00:06:26.380> back<00:06:26.590> up<00:06:26.710> you<00:06:26.770> actually<00:06:27.010> have

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:27.100 
charging this back up you actually have

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.950 
charging this back up you actually have
to<00:06:27.160> plug<00:06:27.370> it<00:06:27.490> in<00:06:27.580> in<00:06:27.850> order<00:06:28.120> to<00:06:28.210> charge<00:06:28.420> the

to plug it in in order to charge the

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.240 
to plug it in in order to charge the
battery<00:06:29.290> and<00:06:29.470> it'll<00:06:29.860> will<00:06:29.950> charge<00:06:30.160> the

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:30.250 
battery and it'll will charge the

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:31.440 
battery and it'll will charge the
battery<00:06:30.490> in<00:06:30.580> the<00:06:30.640> phone<00:06:30.820> at<00:06:30.910> the<00:06:30.970> same<00:06:31.120> time<00:06:31.330> if
