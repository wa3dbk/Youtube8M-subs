 Today I filmed a wedding rehearsal day at Chungdam Avenue Juno 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:12.589
 I got a makeup. 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:13.669
 I looked at the make-up first . 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:18.860
 It was a week. 

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:20.060
 It's a book made of ice, made of water or cosmetics. 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:25.730
 I do not know. 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:31.180
 In the test presented here to help jotdeoraguyo while shooting wongyu Masterpiece Studios 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.180
 A friend who had been on a regular basis came and was filmed continuously. 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:40.469

 4 2 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:58.400
 The bride can not really do anything when shooting. 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:02.720
 If so, it would be nice to finish what you did the night before . 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:07.670
 I was so busy that I only took three hours to shoot . 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:10.420
 Even if you change your shoes, you both can help 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.420
 I was there. 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:26.370
 For these scenes, make sure you have a clean 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:31.970
 Hair removal is a must. 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.970
 I sprinkled perfume for my help question. 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:49.320
 You have to use a bridge to make your leg look pretty. 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:51.320
 The book was hard on the next day at 100

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:13.840
 Actual shooting was so cold that the shooting date was very hot or very hot 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:18.550
 I think it's a good idea to avoid it on a cold day. 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.450
 I'm in March, but when I'm not cold, I try to shoot the date at the end of November 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.670
 I got it. 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:29.010
 It does that means the commercial catch cold easily eat about four in the pharmacy after subtracting love 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.010

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:46.940

 I want to be a joke , but in the meantime, I 've raised my boyfriend a little bit. 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:19.950
 The boyfriend is well-received personality, so it is well done, but those who do not, 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.950
 I did a lot of it. 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.630
 I finished it by taking a casual shot with brass . 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.670
