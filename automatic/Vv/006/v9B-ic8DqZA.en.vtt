00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 there are people from youtube we have more 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.200
 gta 5 information this time referring 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.210
 how to escape from the police the 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.309
 information this time comes from gamestop 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.280
 for a publication they did in their 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.800
 facebook page which told us that 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.660
 the players or we would be 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.609
 able to use the bands 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.010
 rival street as a means of 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.869
 escape from the police 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.849
 interesting truth but this is not so 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.640
 Novelty since during deliveries 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.800
 earlier like the gta san andreas the 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.200
 police officers were also entertained with 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.719
 street gangs with either the bums 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.579
 the bullets or the Aztecs or with any 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.129
 armed thief who made a fuss over the 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.200
 streets or as in gta 4 and the 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.320
 expansions where also the cops 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.539
 they were entertained with the local bands and 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.960
 that gave you a slight chance to escape 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:55.289
 although not quite but this could be 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.420
 improved in gta 5 or we could use 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.969
 really that distraction to escape 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.390
 effectively from the police I read you the 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.090
 full publication of gamestop in gta 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.780
 5 street gangs are still 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.000
 a problem 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.280
 saints while the members of the 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.920
 lost are doing theirs in the 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.659
 county of blind some gangs are 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.030
 more interested in the struggle with 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.299
 police that others use this as 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.909
 advantage to escape from the law then 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.580
 As I mentioned before, it seems that 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.130
 gta 5 will have a more dynamic role than 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.770
 gta san andreas and gta 4 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.690
 in the latter there were many bands like 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.970
 the Russians in broker the mafia in 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.000
 Someone but we did not have 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.729
 so much interaction with them I mean 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.100
 that attacking them infuriated them only in that 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.229
 moment but after a certain time at 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.330
 return to that area these members of 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.820
 the bands no longer attacked you 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.920
 difference of gta vice city ​​where the 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.140
 Haitians after a mission in 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.110
 they would attack you if you went through their 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.270
 zone or like the same san andreas when 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.909
 you went through bullet territory these you 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.039
 attacked collectively it seems to be 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.990
 that this participation between bands and 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.899
 characters will return in a more 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.450
 advanced, it should be remembered that more 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.590
 gamestop had also published that the 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.540
 policemen would use 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.150
 most advanced driving tactics 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.190
 for the catches but the ability to 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.069
 be able to use the bands as a means of 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.019
 escape sounds very interesting 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.360
 good the information has been short 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.400
 keep an eye on the channel that I'll be 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.549
 uploading new information every time 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:36.530
 come out in a magazine or publication 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:36.530
 see you in the next video bye bye
