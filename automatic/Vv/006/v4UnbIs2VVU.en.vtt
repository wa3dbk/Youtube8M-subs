00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:15.900
 how I came to it at all because of it 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.109
 a book was written about mine 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.060
 whole work and then I have time 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:23.760
 So I had to my old pieces 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.390
 watch me and sometimes even steps 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.800
 We say I was was like this 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.560

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.520

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.520
 resume 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:58.910
 Actually, that is me nothing 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:00.460

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.440

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:21.590
 nothing changes but in which there are four 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:25.280
 Dancers dance now and one the 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:29.179

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.090

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.720
 as static that has come visible 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.720
 process of everyday life 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:06.160
 it is quite simple actually 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.900
 my own autobiography and that is 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.940
 actually the only time I do that 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:14.260

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:20.280
 development phase from the early 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.280
 childhood everything was greiss normal 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.860
 very full of german dance tradition and 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.680

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.250
 them moves the bring in motion the 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.790
