 83 years old a conductor of world renown 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.490
 he knows since a week that he is the price in the king category

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.070
 anyone 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.520
 when he communicated the office of reform and I was 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.710
 was surprised 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.320
 I have to say I never have 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.090
 after that dictated the same prize or title to get my whole 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.920
 For a long time never was more and more surprised was granted the more Red 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.220
 it is this direction that went 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.270
 Let's concentrate on a kind of home game for Kurt Masur 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.590
 From 2002 to 2008 he was principal conductor of the Orchester National de France 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.340
 he is his honorary conductor 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.010
 whether in Paris, New York or London 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.460
 to his guests some of whom are almost more 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.760
 Edison's percent RBS percent round swept across even a single one 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.990
 times that such device does not call 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.480
 because it was when I was very young 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.970
 11 percent from Reuters 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.110
 manipulated a bit and that has me very deeply affected because 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.390
 i believe that musicians are a very good people all together 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.940
 The musician we must now necessarily York Ultima in addition to good music 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.890
 and she has to play 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.240
 if you are educated I am in the spirit of virtue and you believe you are like that 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.770
 like him 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.770
 So that's not very brave 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.609
 were 

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:10.119
 There the government meets said the coach must now well-known orchestra to the 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.240

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.259
 or the State Youth Orchestra 

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:21.589
 is more 

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:23.569
 Dr

 Top group up there limits this until the completion of the first 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.699
 Moment on so happened to work for his way of working for his character 

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:40.970
 his energy 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.610
 As conductor he has a lot of what the orchestra is for him at Prohaska 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.380
 Close contacts remain possible for about 20 minutes - at that time I was totally different 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.309
 In the meantime, you can not play anymore without thinking about it 

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:56.230
 through him I have learned that the music inside me 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.589
 I owe it to me to thrive it well until the thinking time 

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:03.589
 all the way 

00:03:04.279 --> 00:03:08.729
 Kurt Masur is born in 1927 in Silesia today Poland 

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:10.659
 the study the ruling Leipzig 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:14.120
 more correct shortly before the exam than a small theater gives him a job as

 Percent was clear to me should she take over 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:23.529
 the exam

 TVN wintry so good that no one to the test 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:35.139
 it is as if that pleased the Niederort with its extraordinary 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:38.599
 Energies manages to get into a dream career in the GDR 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:43.809
 In 1970 he becomes Kapellmeister of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra the corpse of the 27 

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:45.849

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:50.609
 the new Gewandhaus built on its urge opens in 1981 

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:58.319

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:59.579
 he his prominence 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.760
 He helps to ensure that the overthrow in the GDR is peaceful 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:05.979
 of course would 

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:09.669
 I have a family. I brought my wife from Japan 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.829
 finally, relatives had been called to complain 

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:18.620
 first as conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.409
 Salzburg Museum 2001 a few days after the attacks of 11 in September 

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:26.830
 the German Requiem by Johannes Brahms on the program 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.680
 we can not have gone home with the same feeling 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.099
 it is 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:35.099
 that's good 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:39.539
 these would 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:48.779
 Back in Paris, Kurt Masur wows the audience with a Robert

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:00.930
 dollar 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.560
 if that gives one of the really great of our time 

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:09.279
 maybe because the music is one of the most important things 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:13.740
 in vain 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.759
 I am happiest if I succeed 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.600
 Room we must have understood
