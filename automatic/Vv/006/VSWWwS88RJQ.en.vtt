00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.060
 the left beach 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.240
 Hello 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.240
 but what an effort 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.840
 you recognize this photograph 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.790
 of Italy seems to have aged in 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.340
 somehow today it seems that those 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.740
 aspects of the youth of the beginning is there 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.560
 still some simple young people fall 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.020
 some ways from this country instead in 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.700
 turmoil no this three things that yes 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.530
 they can do a lot of things for 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.970
 really your life can be that 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.340
 that you want to do yours 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.770
 attitude is the largest of the 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.140
 degrees the greatest of knowledge 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.050
 spirit with which you face things is 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.150
 what makes the rules change, excuse the 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.339
 demand to fight if today you had to 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.670
 face these that is the theme of 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:55.159
 imbalance and ideas and those who know nothing 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.470
 you will also notice the theme 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:59.780
 it is still the governments or today there is the 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.479
 theme of private financed institutions 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.260
 there are so many people involved in this 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:08.180
 immediately and a name organized by 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:11.390
 of the largest companies in the world e 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.090
 this suffered now gone internet 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:18.140
 there were those who according to them were 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:20.869
 80 people 80 people more 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.340
 important on the planet as far as 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.579
 it's about the future 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.350
 it's okay that tradition has treated it 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:29.630
 but that represented a path to 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.700
 something of the future this is a promise 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.859
 the interesting note of is a premise 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.259
 this meeting that lasted 4 days e 

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:38.799
 that there were nobel prizes put two 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:42.289
 delegates of great multinationals 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:44.350
 pharmaceutical technology activists 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:46.600
 activists 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.270
 the term humans one love the most 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.549
 important among feminists as 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.100
 great skater of the world thor and gov 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:57.520

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.100
 surfers there was not a politician one 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.940
 not one of them was the head of the bank 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.100
 worldwide there was this thing here not 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.679
 see that politicians because they weren't there 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.290
 I ask this thing why not 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.760
 serve they said with effect 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.130
 this area 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.000
 in this context, the policy is not 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.030
 important 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.060
 we decide things because 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.340
 big guy I say the technocrat on duty is 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.130
 what we do not like because the croc 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.200
 the technocrat had a vision 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.630
 system things that state in the states 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.650
 united they participated with mine 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:37.739
 important festival music good- natured a 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.019
 other of ischia but lollapalooza in 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.730
 argentina another in the satellites that ad 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.450
 in short, a very big thing and 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.160
 hundreds of thousands of people 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.280
 lots of guys who work that 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.090
 they work and ana I wonder machines page 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.310
 destitute who will be a party are 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.630
 mountains are as contrary as they are mortal 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.700
 even without it we have a court in 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.680
 charity in the sense we have a whole 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.959
 there is the born alone festival 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.540
 industrial with an entrepreneur with a 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:10.750
 lots of sponsor brands and these 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.680
 accept to make mon for free is nor one 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.269
 answer is in pieces 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:18.430
 however they show inside the music 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:21.910
 make the experience live to names of the 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.010
 question remains does not accept 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.240
 dallas which means means that 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.580
 however it is not free 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.620
 that job they participated in 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.450
 what not built something inside of itself 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.130
 we didn't have the songs in love with me 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.800
 like to write love songs that 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.530
 they serve in the sense that I had them 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.310
 need to re write a nice song 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.070
 because probably where he wants 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.770
 conquer points but I had to recreate a 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:47.250
 climate within the couple that has 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.250
 known that 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:05.790
 I think the tragedy is yes 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.790
 a singer asks this content 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.959
 but why talk 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.819
 They followed your passions bono 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.829
 in the end he finds himself following situations 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:22.690
 and parents in the end is not that he can 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:23.199
 get them needed and that everything goes 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.750
 well 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:28.449
 appollonio plays for the road 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.020
 precisely because they sent and at the end 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:35.169
 one says romance gone though studies no 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:37.360
 super 8 new good attitude than you 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.260
 intensely want to change for 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.690
 more angry 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.340
 deviant attitudes a little bit that 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:52.449
 Finally publishers have never paid 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:54.220
 nothing a possibility always different 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:56.350
 because who gives you the possibility to 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.160
 stability that is telling a lie but 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.160
 the possibility is there 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.970
 the music they blow 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:17.040
 but that the fragmented republic 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:19.440
 Italian to infinity one of the few 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.170
 certainties of the sandwich that is one of the 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.750
 there there is no internal debate there 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:29.580
 it's a big party I made of 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:31.950
 tell us what it will be now 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:36.030
 the event more than an alternating mounting 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:37.830
 their decision is chestnut between two rivers 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:41.940
 in the parterre of people there is not 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:43.770
 no other game a lira 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:50.040
 will be a selected one and try to 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:52.890
 understand the glorious user and me 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.840
 I like doing it because I don't like the rest 

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.380
 done 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.380
 inside 

00:06:00.739 --> 00:06:08.959
 so the rest however always a little crazy 

00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:08.959
 fairs because when you leave 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:19.289
 bar of 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.289
 has succeeded well 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.699
 will transfer stalin 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.659
 the summer 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:32.659
 freedom
