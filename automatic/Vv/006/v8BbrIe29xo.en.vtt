00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.060
 to the neck 

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:09.410
 once I have ready this what 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:12.530
 I'm going to do is put my layer here 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.839
 the layer I 'm going to fold this part more 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:20.410
 girl is up the widest to 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:24.350
 down I'm going to fold the chick if so 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:27.340
 and I'm just going to place it 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.340
 let's calculate 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.050
 I just place it 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.630
 and peru 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:42.080
 As you can see, the idea is very simple 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:44.550
 that they do something easy this that not that 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:48.660
 do not be too complicated 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.390
 and that is economical 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.460
 and so they have many clients who 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.680
 they buy because it is very difficult to 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.630
 economy lately 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:05.320
 well there I have the jacket 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:05.320
 Now I'm going to move on to stick his little arms 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.409
 the fatty ones are going to go a little bit here 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:17.320
 I'm also going to paste a bit 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:21.280
 neck if there is the neck of the 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:25.240
 of the little room 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:30.690
 now I'm going to stick the arms I have there 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.690
 one down here come there 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.840
 so we put them to the hands 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.270
 now let's paste them 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:45.609
 to the body remember that we 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:48.759
 we had grabbed with this post silicone 

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:52.710
 the dress also to the body so that 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.710
 our arms moved 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:01.049
 we are putting more silicones on the side 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:04.180
 the other side shaping this 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:09.179
 little hand and see how the 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:11.519
 little jacket yes and the dress 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.480
 then what are we going to do 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:18.440
 place the east 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.390
 the nose we paste and we put silicone all 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.370
 around 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:28.610
 we are going to locate it and we are going to treat it well 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:32.569
 and while this is sticking I'm going 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:35.000
 showing these are the pieces that 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.120
 seize to stay for the hair you know 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.790
 which is the ecological canvas that is very 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:44.300
 economic and I think it's between the fabrics 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:48.430
 the most economical then once you already 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:51.860
 I have this, I'm going to locate our 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:57.750
 little ears if we are going to put a little 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:03:01.460
 of silicone here so we give movement 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:04.550
 we give it a little movement 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:08.120
 and let's move on to paste it 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:11.160
 active in the head 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.819
 from one side 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.420
 there is good 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:19.750
 and the other 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:23.530
 we do the same thing we do as a clamp 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:26.870
 to mark the ear and the 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:30.129
 we locate from the other 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.129
 from the other coast 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.749
 to see the little ears 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:48.560
 well once I have ready this yes 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.270
 of course you are going to do it with 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.560
 more calm 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:57.970
 I will be placing the rolls of 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.800
 little hair that at the same time will be wool if 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:06.500
 be careful because it is not very 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:11.930
 hot the silicone because this theme 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:14.840
 that burns me very much the rolls this 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.739
 of the ecological canvas now I'm going to paste 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.739
 everything behind 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:23.030
 now back there's also let's put 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:27.830
 the rolls 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:31.830
 remember that this is a little lamb 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:34.680
 economic if the idea is to do with 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:39.200
 materials that we have that we do not 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.200
 come out they do not cost much 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:48.140
 and so we're hitting 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:52.410
 in the whole head we are covering 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:54.429
 also everything if we cover the idea is 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:58.489
 do not look 

00:04:54.429 --> 00:05:03.020
 the imperfections but do not see 

00:04:58.489 --> 00:05:07.879
 the seams that are all covered 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:10.100
 although I'm adding everything in all my 

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:13.640
 little head 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:15.050
 well then once you've covered everything 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.660
 after you are going to do it more 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:21.400
 calm the house look how it looks 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:25.100
 back the head well they will stay 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:28.110
 back is this way this is the little body and they 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:30.720
 It will stay like this 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.880
 the little sheep 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:36.780
 come from pretty 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:38.550
 I hope you liked this that the 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.040
 of course you will do me 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:44.100
 do in the house with more patience you 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.870
 they are going to put color in the cheeks 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:49.830
 and it will be 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:53.180
 spectacular, good if you like me
