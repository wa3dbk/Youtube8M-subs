where we love their tenants and we have
other<00:00:31.700> apples<00:00:32.210> where<00:00:32.360> there's<00:00:32.570> some<00:00:32.920> some

other apples where there's some some

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.980 
other apples where there's some some

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:35.990 
mysterious thing about their flavor that

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.760 
mysterious thing about their flavor that
we<00:00:36.050> particularly<00:00:37.180> find<00:00:38.260> appealing<00:00:39.260> to<00:00:39.620> our

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
we particularly find appealing to our

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.670 
we particularly find appealing to our
taste<00:00:40.460> in<00:00:40.640> cider<00:00:40.850> making<00:00:41.320> and<00:00:42.320> we<00:00:42.410> have<00:00:42.530> about

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
taste in cider making and we have about

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.120 
taste in cider making and we have about
five<00:00:43.490> planted<00:00:44.150> acres<00:00:44.450> of<00:00:44.660> apple<00:00:45.440> trees<00:00:45.710> and

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.130 
five planted acres of apple trees and

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.610 
five planted acres of apple trees and
then<00:00:46.880> it's<00:00:47.330> most<00:00:47.780> of<00:00:47.870> our<00:00:47.990> land<00:00:48.140> is<00:00:48.260> forest

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
then it's most of our land is forest

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.290 
then it's most of our land is forest
there's<00:00:48.800> probably<00:00:49.130> close<00:00:49.430> to<00:00:49.520> 50<00:00:49.730> acres<00:00:50.000> but

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
there's probably close to 50 acres but

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.450 
there's probably close to 50 acres but
it's<00:00:50.360> forests<00:00:50.870> and<00:00:51.590> so<00:00:51.800> we<00:00:51.920> cleared<00:00:52.160> it<00:00:52.280> it<00:00:52.370> was

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
it's forests and so we cleared it it was

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.040 
it's forests and so we cleared it it was
all<00:00:52.610> for<00:00:52.850> us<00:00:52.880> this<00:00:52.970> was<00:00:53.210> all<00:00:53.360> for<00:00:53.540> my<00:00:53.840> parents

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
got here really and they cut down all

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.370 
got here really and they cut down all
the<00:00:55.970> trees<00:00:56.090> and<00:00:56.390> clear<00:00:56.540> to<00:00:56.600> go<00:00:56.720> themselves<00:00:56.960> but

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
more expansive in the mouth so it's a

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.900 
more expansive in the mouth so it's a

rustling<00:02:45.120> this<00:02:45.450> is<00:02:45.510> not<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:45.840> Roxbury<00:02:46.320> russet

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
rustling this is not a Roxbury russet

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.770 
rustling this is not a Roxbury russet
what<00:02:46.890> is<00:02:46.980> rising<00:02:47.400> mean<00:02:47.579> see<00:02:48.329> how<00:02:48.450> it's<00:02:48.570> sort<00:02:48.660> of

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
what is rising mean see how it's sort of

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.750 
what is rising mean see how it's sort of
brown<00:02:49.140> rather<00:02:49.590> than<00:02:49.799> like<00:02:49.920> a<00:02:49.950> McIntosh<00:02:50.549> you

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
brown rather than like a McIntosh you

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.830 
brown rather than like a McIntosh you
can<00:02:50.910> see<00:02:51.060> how<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.239> skin<00:02:52.200> is<00:02:52.230> sort<00:02:52.620> of<00:02:52.709> hard<00:02:53.840> so

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
can see how the skin is sort of hard so

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.800 
can see how the skin is sort of hard so
that's<00:02:55.049> that's<00:02:55.260> a<00:02:55.440> russet<00:02:56.239> which<00:02:57.239> russets

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
that's that's a russet which russets

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.780 
that's that's a russet which russets
gently<00:02:58.260> as<00:02:58.829> a<00:02:58.859> general<00:02:59.280> rule<00:02:59.430> of<00:02:59.489> thumb<00:02:59.579> I

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
gently as a general rule of thumb I

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.460 
gently as a general rule of thumb I
would<00:02:59.820> say<00:03:00.000> russets<00:03:00.329> tend<00:03:00.810> to<00:03:00.870> be<00:03:00.989> great<00:03:01.230> cider

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
would say russets tend to be great cider

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.680 
would say russets tend to be great cider
