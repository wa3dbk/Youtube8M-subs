48<00:00:46.710> grams<00:00:46.860> protein<00:00:47.070> then<00:00:47.430> rather<00:00:48.000> than<00:00:48.120> 24<00:00:48.809> has

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
48 grams protein then rather than 24 has

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.240 
48 grams protein then rather than 24 has

of<00:00:53.340> sugar<00:00:54.410> which<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.649> excellent<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.340> then

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
of sugar which is excellent and then

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.410 
of sugar which is excellent and then
there's<00:00:56.640> only<00:00:56.789> three<00:00:57.059> games<00:00:57.239> of

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
there's only three games of

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.310 
there's only three games of
carbohydrates<00:00:58.020> in<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:59.129> it's<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.640> very<00:00:59.670> lean

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
carbohydrates in it so it's a very lean

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.850

protein<00:01:01.320> shake<00:01:02.600> flavor-wise<00:01:03.600> this<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.619> the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
protein shake flavor-wise this is the

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.969 
protein shake flavor-wise this is the
extreme<00:01:05.489> milk<00:01:05.700> chocolate<00:01:06.119> flavor<00:01:06.979> it's

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
extreme milk chocolate flavor it's

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.730 
extreme milk chocolate flavor it's
really<00:01:08.280> not<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.460> bad<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:09.090> mean<00:01:09.750> it's<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.439> since

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
really not that bad I mean it's it since

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.399 
really not that bad I mean it's it since
isn't<00:01:11.010> isolate<00:01:11.460> it's<00:01:11.670> really<00:01:12.420> it's<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:13.020> watery

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
isn't isolate it's really it's a watery

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.719 
isn't isolate it's really it's a watery
protein<00:01:13.979> it's<00:01:14.909> not<00:01:15.000> like<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.180> thick<00:01:15.540> like<00:01:16.290> rich

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
protein it's not like a thick like rich

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.820 
protein it's not like a thick like rich
protein<00:01:17.729> like<00:01:18.090> like<00:01:18.479> syntha-6<00:01:18.840> from<00:01:19.380> BSN

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
protein like like syntha-6 from BSN

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.859 
protein like like syntha-6 from BSN
that's<00:01:20.100> rich<00:01:20.460> protein<00:01:20.939> this<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.330> watery

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
that's rich protein this is a watery

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.609 
that's rich protein this is a watery
tasting<00:01:22.290> protein<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.930> mean<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:25.110> goes<00:01:25.439> down

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
tasting protein so I mean it goes down

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.350 
tasting protein so I mean it goes down
pretty<00:01:25.770> quickly<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.189> don't<00:01:26.490> sit<00:01:26.880> there<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.090> set

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
pretty quickly I don't sit there and set

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.480 
pretty quickly I don't sit there and set
bit<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.659> just<00:01:27.840> drink<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:28.590> fast<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.250> tastes

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
bit I just drink it fast and it tastes

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.190

during my week school overall very good
product<00:02:41.910> very<00:02:42.330> good<00:02:42.540> protein<00:02:42.900> powder

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
product very good protein powder

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.620 
product very good protein powder
probably<00:02:44.520> one<00:02:44.610> of<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:44.760> best<00:02:44.910> protein<00:02:45.180> powders

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
probably one of the best protein powders

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.630 
probably one of the best protein powders
out<00:02:45.780> there<00:02:46.040> this<00:02:47.040> is<00:02:47.190> not<00:02:47.340> a<00:02:47.370> weight<00:02:47.610> gainer

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
out there this is not a weight gainer

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.550 
out there this is not a weight gainer
it's<00:02:48.120> just<00:02:48.300> a<00:02:48.420> regular<00:02:48.630> protein<00:02:49.140> isolate

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
it's just a regular protein isolate

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.210 
it's just a regular protein isolate
protein<00:02:49.740> so<00:02:50.690> and<00:02:51.690> you<00:02:51.900> will<00:02:52.110> you<00:02:52.530> will<00:02:52.680> get

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
protein so and you will you will get

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.180 
protein so and you will you will get
myself<00:02:53.610> this<00:02:53.910> but<00:02:54.480> you<00:02:55.020> won't<00:02:55.080> get<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.920> fat

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
myself this but you won't get the fat

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.600 
myself this but you won't get the fat
that<00:02:56.520> goes<00:02:56.790> along<00:02:56.970> with<00:02:57.120> like<00:02:57.480> weight<00:02:57.840> gainers

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
that goes along with like weight gainers

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.750 
that goes along with like weight gainers
so<00:02:59.990> go<00:03:00.990> out<00:03:01.050> there<00:03:01.140> get<00:03:01.500> yourself<00:03:01.860> a<00:03:02.100> bucket<00:03:02.610> of

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
so go out there get yourself a bucket of

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.750 
so go out there get yourself a bucket of
1%<00:03:03.450> go<00:03:03.540> away
