00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.070 

you

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.799 

if<00:00:08.080> I'm<00:00:08.380> standing<00:00:08.710> here<00:00:09.150> where<00:00:10.150> is<00:00:10.480> the<00:00:10.660> water

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:10.809 
if I'm standing here where is the water

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:24.020 
if I'm standing here where is the water
coming<00:00:11.260> from<00:00:11.410> let's<00:00:12.280> take<00:00:12.490> a<00:00:12.550> look<00:00:14.340> okay

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:24.030 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.620 

okay<00:00:25.650> so<00:00:26.650> here<00:00:27.400> we've<00:00:27.580> got<00:00:27.610> part<00:00:28.180> of<00:00:28.300> the<00:00:28.360> ridge

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
okay so here we've got part of the ridge

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.920 
okay so here we've got part of the ridge
line<00:00:29.310> here<00:00:30.310> I'm<00:00:30.670> standing<00:00:31.060> on<00:00:31.270> the<00:00:31.420> high<00:00:31.570> point

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
line here I'm standing on the high point

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.500 
line here I'm standing on the high point
on<00:00:32.200> this<00:00:32.800> side<00:00:33.130> the<00:00:33.400> water<00:00:33.610> goes<00:00:34.000> into<00:00:34.330> the

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
on this side the water goes into the

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.080 
on this side the water goes into the
parking<00:00:34.930> lot<00:00:34.990> but<00:00:35.680> on<00:00:35.770> my<00:00:35.950> right<00:00:36.190> side<00:00:36.220> the

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
parking lot but on my right side the

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.960 
parking lot but on my right side the
water<00:00:37.300> goes<00:00:37.600> into<00:00:37.900> the<00:00:38.320> garden<00:00:38.740> so<00:00:39.520> this

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
water goes into the garden so this

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.210 
water goes into the garden so this
rainfall<00:00:40.510> and<00:00:40.660> runoff<00:00:40.690> is<00:00:41.260> part<00:00:41.620> of<00:00:41.830> the<00:00:42.010> water

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.220 
rainfall and runoff is part of the water

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.420 
rainfall and runoff is part of the water
income<00:00:42.700> for<00:00:43.300> that<00:00:43.480> area<00:00:44.070> but<00:00:45.070> let's<00:00:45.250> keep

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
income for that area but let's keep

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:54.090 
income for that area but let's keep
going<00:00:45.730> along<00:00:45.970> the<00:00:46.090> ridgeline<00:00:52.500> we<00:00:53.500> also<00:00:53.710> get

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
going along the ridgeline we also get

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.009 
going along the ridgeline we also get
these<00:00:54.280> rooftops<00:00:54.670> which<00:00:55.330> are<00:00:55.510> draining<00:00:55.780> the

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:56.019 
these rooftops which are draining the

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:58.320 
these rooftops which are draining the
water<00:00:56.050> to<00:00:56.830> the<00:00:56.920> backside<00:00:57.430> which<00:00:57.940> is<00:00:58.089> also

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:58.330 
water to the backside which is also

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:07.200 
water to the backside which is also
diverted<00:00:58.960> into<00:00:59.080> the<00:00:59.290> garden<00:01:05.940> here<00:01:06.940> if<00:01:07.090> you

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
diverted into the garden here if you

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.540 
diverted into the garden here if you
eyeball<00:01:07.750> it<00:01:07.960> you<00:01:08.230> can<00:01:08.409> see<00:01:08.650> right<00:01:08.680> about<00:01:09.159> there

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
eyeball it you can see right about there

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.270 
eyeball it you can see right about there
the<00:01:09.970> slope<00:01:10.300> is<00:01:10.480> that<00:01:10.750> way<00:01:10.990> here<00:01:11.650> the<00:01:11.830> slope<00:01:11.980> is

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
the slope is that way here the slope is

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.230 
the slope is that way here the slope is
that<00:01:12.550> way<00:01:12.760> so<00:01:13.540> I<00:01:13.570> can<00:01:13.810> see<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:15.460> parking<00:01:16.210> lot

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
that way so I can see this parking lot

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.810 
that way so I can see this parking lot
is<00:01:16.570> probably<00:01:17.200> also<00:01:17.500> contributing<00:01:18.340> water<00:01:18.580> to

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
is probably also contributing water to

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.200 
is probably also contributing water to
the<00:01:18.940> garden<00:01:19.300> this<00:01:20.229> sidewalk<00:01:20.890> is<00:01:21.220> acting<00:01:22.030> as<00:01:22.180> a

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
the garden this sidewalk is acting as a

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.030 
the garden this sidewalk is acting as a
ridge<00:01:22.450> line<00:01:22.750> along<00:01:23.140> with<00:01:23.350> these<00:01:23.500> planters

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
ridge line along with these planters

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.760 
ridge line along with these planters
there's<00:01:24.850> no<00:01:25.060> way<00:01:25.300> that<00:01:25.600> water<00:01:25.900> can<00:01:26.290> move<00:01:26.320> this

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
there's no way that water can move this

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.760 
there's no way that water can move this
way<00:01:27.040> it<00:01:27.310> can<00:01:27.460> only<00:01:27.700> go<00:01:28.060> that<00:01:28.299> way<00:01:28.540> so<00:01:29.380> I<00:01:29.409> keep

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
way it can only go that way so I keep

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:37.170 
way it can only go that way so I keep
walking<00:01:30.189> along<00:01:30.460> the<00:01:30.610> ridge<00:01:30.790> here<00:01:35.939> now<00:01:36.939> we've

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
walking along the ridge here now we've

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.469 
walking along the ridge here now we've
got<00:01:37.360> the<00:01:37.570> top<00:01:37.810> of<00:01:38.020> the<00:01:38.079> parking<00:01:38.320> lot<00:01:38.710> and<00:01:39.479> this

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
got the top of the parking lot and this

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.749 
got the top of the parking lot and this
is<00:01:40.780> more<00:01:41.350> or<00:01:41.409> less<00:01:41.530> about<00:01:41.920> the<00:01:42.280> ridge<00:01:42.460> line

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
is more or less about the ridge line

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:44.760 
is more or less about the ridge line
right<00:01:43.479> here<00:01:43.780> we're<00:01:43.990> getting<00:01:44.259> a<00:01:44.320> little<00:01:44.409> bit<00:01:44.649> of

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
right here we're getting a little bit of

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.700 
right here we're getting a little bit of
runoff<00:01:44.979> coming<00:01:45.549> along<00:01:45.759> here<00:01:46.240> but<00:01:46.990> this<00:01:47.409> water

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
runoff coming along here but this water

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.679 
runoff coming along here but this water
sticking<00:01:48.280> around<00:01:48.399> we've<00:01:48.789> got<00:01:48.969> a<00:01:49.000> raise<00:01:49.270> curb

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 
sticking around we've got a raise curb

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:51.389 
sticking around we've got a raise curb
which<00:01:49.960> is<00:01:50.110> not<00:01:50.289> allowing<00:01:50.740> run<00:01:50.950> off<00:01:51.100> that<00:01:51.340> way

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
which is not allowing run off that way

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:53.370 
which is not allowing run off that way
even<00:01:51.939> though<00:01:52.180> the<00:01:52.329> general<00:01:52.659> slopes<00:01:52.960> that<00:01:53.079> way

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
even though the general slopes that way

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.980 
even though the general slopes that way
the<00:01:54.070> Rays<00:01:54.280> curb<00:01:54.789> around<00:01:55.210> that<00:01:55.390> building<00:01:55.630> is

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
the Rays curb around that building is

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.649 
the Rays curb around that building is
keeping<00:01:56.409> that<00:01:56.560> roofs<00:01:56.890> runoff<00:01:57.369> down<00:01:58.299> they're

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
keeping that roofs runoff down they're

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.800 
keeping that roofs runoff down they're
not<00:01:58.930> coming<00:01:59.439> into<00:01:59.829> the<00:01:59.890> parking<00:02:00.250> lot<00:02:00.310> so<00:02:01.180> as<00:02:01.479> I

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
not coming into the parking lot so as I

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.080 
not coming into the parking lot so as I
walk<00:02:02.049> the<00:02:02.079> ridge<00:02:02.380> line<00:02:02.649> then<00:02:02.920> now<00:02:03.789> we're<00:02:04.030> at

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
walk the ridge line then now we're at

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:13.160 
walk the ridge line then now we're at
the<00:02:04.210> top

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.990 

and<00:02:14.580> it<00:02:15.580> continues<00:02:16.120> right<00:02:16.150> on<00:02:16.690> here<00:02:17.580> down<00:02:18.580> past

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
and it continues right on here down past

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.750 
and it continues right on here down past
this<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:20.320> down<00:02:20.590> slope<00:02:20.890> side<00:02:21.280> of<00:02:21.610> those

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
this the down slope side of those

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.610 
this the down slope side of those
buildings<00:02:22.120> so<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.780> building's<00:02:23.140> we<00:02:23.290> looked<00:02:23.470> at

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
buildings so the building's we looked at

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.850 
buildings so the building's we looked at
earlier<00:02:23.860> their<00:02:24.730> roof<00:02:25.000> runoffs<00:02:25.650> falling<00:02:26.650> down

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
earlier their roof runoffs falling down

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.700 
earlier their roof runoffs falling down
there<00:02:27.190> and<00:02:27.430> going<00:02:27.970> in<00:02:28.180> that<00:02:28.300> direction<00:02:28.710> into

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
there and going in that direction into

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.210 
there and going in that direction into
the<00:02:29.800> garden<00:02:30.220> and<00:02:31.740> actually<00:02:32.740> I<00:02:32.800> just<00:02:32.830> see

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
the garden and actually I just see

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.040 
the garden and actually I just see
there's<00:02:33.520> even<00:02:33.820> more<00:02:33.850> water<00:02:34.300> going<00:02:34.630> in<00:02:34.840> there

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
there's even more water going in there

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.790 
there's even more water going in there
so<00:02:35.470> this<00:02:35.710> asphalt<00:02:36.700> paved<00:02:37.510> area<00:02:38.050> just<00:02:38.620> above

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
so this asphalt paved area just above

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.610 
so this asphalt paved area just above
the<00:02:39.010> bleachers<00:02:39.670> of<00:02:39.880> the<00:02:39.970> field<00:02:40.330> all<00:02:40.630> of<00:02:41.410> that

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
the bleachers of the field all of that

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.370 
the bleachers of the field all of that
is<00:02:41.980> draining<00:02:42.850> this<00:02:43.210> way<00:02:43.450> and<00:02:43.780> it's<00:02:43.930> sloped

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
is draining this way and it's sloped

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.370 
is draining this way and it's sloped
into<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.100> banks<00:02:45.520> so<00:02:45.970> that<00:02:46.000> also<00:02:46.720> goes<00:02:47.020> to<00:02:47.080> the

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
into the banks so that also goes to the

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.880 
into the banks so that also goes to the
garden<00:02:47.770> and<00:02:48.490> since<00:02:49.060> thats<00:02:49.900> collecting<00:02:50.350> water

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
garden and since thats collecting water

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.690 
garden and since thats collecting water
we<00:02:51.610> do<00:02:51.970> get<00:02:52.330> the<00:02:52.510> water<00:02:52.690> from<00:02:53.020> this<00:02:53.260> roof

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
we do get the water from this roof

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.270 
we do get the water from this roof
because<00:02:54.700> its<00:02:55.030> waters<00:02:55.660> all<00:02:55.870> draining<00:02:56.350> down<00:02:56.590> to

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
because its waters all draining down to

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.200 
because its waters all draining down to
that<00:02:57.460> area<00:02:57.490> and<00:02:58.120> then<00:02:58.660> on<00:02:58.870> down<00:02:59.250> so<00:03:00.250> there's<00:03:00.970> a

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.210 
that area and then on down so there's a

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.210 
that area and then on down so there's a
huge<00:03:01.630> amount<00:03:02.110> of<00:03:02.230> water<00:03:02.440> going<00:03:02.860> to<00:03:02.980> this

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
huge amount of water going to this

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:11.470 
huge amount of water going to this
garden

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.720 

and<00:03:11.629> here<00:03:12.530> at<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:12.890> bottom<00:03:13.250> of<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.489> parking

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
and here at the bottom of the parking

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.170 
and here at the bottom of the parking
lot<00:03:14.060> you<00:03:14.480> can<00:03:14.690> see<00:03:14.989> that<00:03:15.769> the<00:03:16.010> Rays<00:03:16.400> curb<00:03:16.940> is

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
lot you can see that the Rays curb is

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.170 
lot you can see that the Rays curb is
depressed<00:03:18.140> or<00:03:18.440> flushed<00:03:18.799> allowing<00:03:19.730> all<00:03:19.940> this

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
depressed or flushed allowing all this

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.140 
depressed or flushed allowing all this
run<00:03:20.420> off<00:03:20.629> to<00:03:21.319> just<00:03:21.500> go<00:03:21.799> right<00:03:22.069> on<00:03:22.129> down<00:03:22.580> here

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
run off to just go right on down here

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:30.220 
run off to just go right on down here
and<00:03:24.670> so<00:03:26.500> instead<00:03:27.500> of<00:03:27.950> growing<00:03:28.190> trailers<00:03:29.230> we

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
and so instead of growing trailers we

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.580 
and so instead of growing trailers we
could<00:03:30.530> be<00:03:30.739> growing<00:03:31.220> a<00:03:31.400> lot<00:03:32.209> of<00:03:32.569> trees<00:03:32.959> that<00:03:33.349> can

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
could be growing a lot of trees that can

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.039 
could be growing a lot of trees that can
shade<00:03:34.010> and<00:03:34.280> passively<00:03:34.790> cool<00:03:35.209> these

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
shade and passively cool these

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.160 
shade and passively cool these
structures<00:03:36.680> and<00:03:37.120> instead<00:03:38.120> of<00:03:38.269> having<00:03:38.569> all<00:03:38.930> the

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
structures and instead of having all the

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.440 
structures and instead of having all the
water<00:03:39.349> down<00:03:39.650> at<00:03:39.920> the<00:03:40.040> bottom<00:03:40.220> we<00:03:41.030> could<00:03:41.329> have

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
water down at the bottom we could have

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.750 
water down at the bottom we could have
been<00:03:41.629> shedding<00:03:41.959> this<00:03:42.319> parking<00:03:42.799> lot<00:03:42.829> to<00:03:43.640> the

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
been shedding this parking lot to the

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.160 
been shedding this parking lot to the
planters<00:03:44.299> all<00:03:44.569> along<00:03:45.110> here<00:03:45.650> so<00:03:46.000> all<00:03:47.000> of<00:03:47.170> the

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
planters all along here so all of the

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.020 
planters all along here so all of the
buffered<00:03:48.590> planting<00:03:49.099> between<00:03:49.400> parking<00:03:49.879> lot

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
buffered planting between parking lot

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.119 
buffered planting between parking lot
and<00:03:50.239> bleacher<00:03:50.780> area<00:03:51.200> could<00:03:51.829> have<00:03:52.010> been

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:52.129 
and bleacher area could have been

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:53.949 
and bleacher area could have been
irrigated<00:03:52.790> with<00:03:52.819> the<00:03:53.030> runoff<00:03:53.359> from<00:03:53.720> the

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
irrigated with the runoff from the

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.610 
irrigated with the runoff from the
parking<00:03:54.319> lot<00:03:54.640> but<00:03:55.640> currently<00:03:56.170> all<00:03:57.170> of<00:03:57.440> this<00:03:57.560> is

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
parking lot but currently all of this is

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.430 
parking lot but currently all of this is
dependent<00:03:58.400> on<00:03:58.549> this<00:03:59.450> piked<00:03:59.750> an<00:03:59.959> irrigation

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
dependent on this piked an irrigation

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.860 
dependent on this piked an irrigation
system<00:04:00.940> because<00:04:01.940> the<00:04:02.090> runoff<00:04:02.450> is<00:04:02.629> being

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
system because the runoff is being

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.569 
system because the runoff is being
diverted<00:04:03.109> away<00:04:03.410> from<00:04:03.560> it<00:04:03.950> from<00:04:04.129> them<00:04:04.250> for<00:04:04.519> the

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
diverted away from it from them for the

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:09.220 
diverted away from it from them for the
most<00:04:04.760> part<00:04:05.440> so<00:04:07.480> it's<00:04:08.480> a<00:04:08.510> little<00:04:08.750> hard<00:04:08.959> to<00:04:09.109> get

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
most part so it's a little hard to get

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.830 
most part so it's a little hard to get
to<00:04:09.379> the<00:04:09.500> trailers<00:04:09.980> but<00:04:10.609> we're<00:04:10.790> going<00:04:10.970> to<00:04:11.090> hop

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
to the trailers but we're going to hop

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.630 
to the trailers but we're going to hop
over<00:04:12.049> to<00:04:12.230> the<00:04:12.349> other<00:04:12.470> side<00:04:12.799> of<00:04:12.859> the<00:04:13.040> fence<00:04:13.280> and

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
over to the other side of the fence and

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.370 
over to the other side of the fence and
then<00:04:14.269> we'll<00:04:14.480> follow<00:04:14.750> the<00:04:15.049> water<00:04:15.230> flow<00:04:15.680> into

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
then we'll follow the water flow into

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.759 
then we'll follow the water flow into
the<00:04:18.380> gardens<00:04:18.859> full<00:04:19.160> of<00:04:19.370> wonderful<00:04:20.359> flush<00:04:20.989> food

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
the gardens full of wonderful flush food

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:32.730 
the gardens full of wonderful flush food
plants<00:04:22.539> let's<00:04:23.539> go

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.980 

okay<00:04:33.740> we're<00:04:33.949> back<00:04:33.979> where<00:04:34.460> we<00:04:34.490> started<00:04:34.990> here

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990

and all that water from the parking lot

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.189 
and all that water from the parking lot
we<00:04:40.009> just<00:04:40.250> looked<00:04:40.460> at<00:04:40.639> is<00:04:40.909> also<00:04:41.599> coming<00:04:41.840> right

consider doing is to raise a bent and
embankment<00:06:36.440> here<00:06:36.800> so<00:06:37.789> you<00:06:37.879> can<00:06:38.150> pull<00:06:38.479> up<00:06:38.779> and

into the the last spillway overflow take
the<00:06:46.039> water<00:06:46.249> out<00:06:46.520> of<00:06:46.550> the<00:06:46.759> system<00:06:48.249> there<00:06:49.249> we<00:06:49.370> go
