while<00:01:30.990> this<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.320> what<00:01:32.310> some<00:01:32.579> would<00:01:32.729> consider

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
while this is what some would consider

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.399 
while this is what some would consider
lower<00:01:33.240> quality<00:01:33.689> than<00:01:33.840> some<00:01:34.049> of<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.200> higher

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
lower quality than some of the higher

end groves which are have a leather
inside<00:01:36.540> arching<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:37.500> is<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.619> really<00:01:37.890> good

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
inside arching this is a really good

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.580 
inside arching this is a really good
idea<00:01:38.159> because<00:01:38.549> often<00:01:39.090> when<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:39.990> used<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.409> wick

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
idea because often when I used to wick

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.039 
idea because often when I used to wick
icky<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.579> used<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.939> leather<00:01:42.180> inside<00:01:42.630> my

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
icky and I used the leather inside my

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.899 
icky and I used the leather inside my
hands<00:01:43.290> would<00:01:43.470> sweat<00:01:43.770> quite<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.130> lot<00:01:44.369> which

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
hands would sweat quite a lot which

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.340 
hands would sweat quite a lot which
means<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.240> as<00:01:45.360> I'm<00:01:45.600> wicked<00:01:45.869> keeping<00:01:46.229> the

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
means that as I'm wicked keeping the

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.770 
means that as I'm wicked keeping the
glove<00:01:46.590> would<00:01:46.799> slip<00:01:47.159> down<00:01:47.430> my<00:01:47.729> hand<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.659> would

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
glove would slip down my hand it would

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.870 
glove would slip down my hand it would
because<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:50.159> way<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.460> leather<00:01:50.640> was

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
because of the the way the leather was

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.520 
because of the the way the leather was
there<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.659> wicking<00:01:51.960> keeping<00:01:52.200> there<00:01:52.350> the

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
there and wicking keeping there the

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.980 
there and wicking keeping there the
glove<00:01:52.770> would<00:01:52.920> slip<00:01:53.460> down<00:01:53.780> because<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:54.899> how

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
glove would slip down because of how

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.510 
glove would slip down because of how
sweaty<00:01:55.290> my<00:01:55.530> hands<00:01:55.710> got<00:01:55.890> meaning<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.310> the

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
sweaty my hands got meaning that the

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.639 
sweaty my hands got meaning that the
marble<00:01:57.329> Hebrew<00:01:57.659> has<00:01:57.750> never<00:01:57.930> gret<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.290> best<00:01:58.469> of

marble Hebrew has never gret the best of

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:59.660 
marble Hebrew has never gret the best of
times<00:01:58.799> but<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.159> would<00:01:59.280> just<00:01:59.399> mean<00:01:59.520> I'm

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
times but it would just mean I'm

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.340 
times but it would just mean I'm
dropping<00:01:59.880> far<00:02:00.360> more<00:02:00.479> holes<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:00.930> even<00:02:01.200> all<00:02:01.320> I

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
dropping far more holes and even all I

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.620 
dropping far more holes and even all I
would<00:02:01.530> used<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.860> whereas<00:02:02.579> now<00:02:02.820> with<00:02:03.149> this<00:02:03.329> mesh

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
would used to whereas now with this mesh

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.359 
would used to whereas now with this mesh
system<00:02:04.110> means<00:02:04.710> your<00:02:04.829> hands<00:02:04.979> are<00:02:05.100> gonna<00:02:05.189> stay

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
system means your hands are gonna stay

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.340 
system means your hands are gonna stay
really<00:02:05.790> nice<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.210> cool<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:07.020> gloves<00:02:07.229> are

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
really nice and cool and the gloves are

really nice and cool and the gloves are
gonna<00:02:07.469> fit<00:02:07.829> really<00:02:08.099> well<00:02:08.220> in<00:02:08.489> place<00:02:08.789> so<00:02:09.330> they

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
gonna fit really well in place so they

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.760 
gonna fit really well in place so they
are<00:02:09.599> I<00:02:09.750> think<00:02:10.050> that's<00:02:10.170> just<00:02:10.229> another<00:02:10.379> really

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770

again is in line with gloves at this

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.700 
again is in line with gloves at this
rage<00:02:18.760> I<00:02:19.090> mean<00:02:19.510> again<00:02:20.020> it's<00:02:20.050> not<00:02:20.320> quite<00:02:20.560> the

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
these inserts there so they are going to

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.080
