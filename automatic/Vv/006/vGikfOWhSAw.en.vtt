00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.730
 when we scored well and we started one more edition of our selection 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.330
 looks sadness deep lack of willingness to perform activities 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.160
 simple day-to-day changes in sleep and a great lack of interest in life 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.000
 people are estimated that about 15% of the world population has already 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.409
 had or will have depression at some point 

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:31.989
 the person feels depressed unhappy from the beat but can deny yes the existence 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:36.030
 This feeling that is here with me speaks more about the subject is the psychiatrist and 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.399
 general psychotherapist of river council specialist in behavioral medicine 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:42.040
 by the federal university of sÃ£o paulo 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.940
 it explains us cause of depression and how to treat it but before we go to a 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.410
 report is thus considered to be 21st century disease and more and more 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.770
 advanced adult world pro world of children and adolescents diagnosis 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.790
 it is difficult and the great majority suffer greatly if one knows the reasons see table 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.760
 depression does not choose social class 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.010
 in families with less financial conditions the unemployment of parents to 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:12.570
 hunger and violence in the neighborhood are often the factors that cause 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.550
 disease in children 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.250
 already in the richest families the depression can appear 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.690
 when parents demand that their children are still older yesterday than they are 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.550
 often the child does not get the result because of a difficulty 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.060
 learning is why 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.650
 that the school is a fundamental partner 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.090
 in early diagnosis of depression are often giving opportunities 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.210
 brigade for the presence of another invitation 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.450
 Let's start then explain the technique at home that is to think how the 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.010
 people 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.770
 makes this diagnosis of a deep sadness of pressure 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.560
 it's the pressure is not sadness 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.810
 we all experience sadness in life and let's experience 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.300
 and sadness even has a function 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.510
 it is often necessary, yes, I felt sadness 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.220
 what it will do to make you rain a little 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.950
 reflects 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.980
 about what I must be the covenant where they erred with you 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.349
 nowadays few people where luck has favored us 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.560
 and how you can change your behavior because what you 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.109
 impaired happened 

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:20.219
 depression does not affect sleep and pititinga have difficulty for me 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:23.939
 sleep wake up and sleep wake up wake up very early sleep more 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:28.559
 may have lost ti-ti-ti that may as well as 

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:32.459
 may on the contrary have more appetite gain weight have difficulty expressing 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.269
 your 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.959
 the islands of mini quite until completely demolished without sexual desire 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.209
 but he will face the madureira at this moment or they have the other yes he 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.989
 has or does he have a depressive wall 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.059
 what a sadness 

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:51.849
 it's kind of new if he confronts the patient he might even find 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:56.569
 as effective as possible expresses sadness but there comes a time when he 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:57.649
 assumes that it is 

00:02:57.649 --> 00:03:02.519
 too strong for justifications that he brings and the person 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.789
 loses pleasure is inclusive in what she likes to do all of them are 

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:08.689
 many symptoms about to change all this 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:13.219
 I understand it's very difficult for me to make this diagnosis for her 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:14.299
 the patient attacker 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:19.260
 she can choose whether she feels everything that is spoken and satiety solsona pt everything 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.079
 if I said more until the 15th I think because you're feeling all this 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:27.769
 It's hard to say 'no, I'm going to look for specialists I'm with 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:28.760
 symptoms 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.159
 depression of things that are not normal in my life is 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.760
 she can only wake her up by carrying this 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:43.400
 I always make the comparison with the port city all panic 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:49.099
 then for example the edital office and have an anxiety attack that seems 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.940
 fall from the sky 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.349
 yeah stay attack every heart shoots 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:57.159
 he feels lack of attention can tell the truth the pressure has no way 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:58.189
 to hide 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:00.369
 henceforth inclusive 

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:04.119
 because then it was treated with the inspiration of the human 

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:05.449
 can control the crisis 

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:07.170
 but it's a simple thing to treat 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.679
 Indian many cases 

00:04:08.679 --> 00:04:10.070
 now depression does not 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.290
 it can drag a mild depression first 'set' into depression from a 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.239
 take to very severe 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.620
 and it can drag a slight depression 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.960
 so it is mainly the man 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:23.840
 what 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.349
 with a culture does not sanction 

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:30.219
 that the man can and should look for a specialist to be 

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:34.659
 Brazilian culture and other cultures were artists. 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:38.770
 the action triggered what would be a sign of weakness 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.460
 so it's not several the artist takes 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.720
 the woman sought depression more easily in children and adolescents 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.810
 it manifests itself quite differently in children 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:49.719
 it is very common 

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:52.999
 I would prefer it to manifest itself as, for example, 

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:55.379
 drop in school performance 

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:59.520
 by crisis start hand slipped at school av several reasons proves that 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.589
 even at school 

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:02.270
 For example, it can be 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.389
 that she has la rosa with the bad teacher a certain matter not only her but 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:07.300
 many go 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.169
 No one is going to work 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:12.949
 increase in school bags necessarily has to be realized more 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:17.389
 can be depression can other problems of attention deficit because 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:20.409
 is that a child has depression what is the 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:25.419
 the trigger of this would be the reasons why it is important that people 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:30.349
 listen to why people in general have depression or human beings not only the 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:31.330
 children 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.330
 there are several theories 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:37.999
 I'll try to translate 

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:39.159
 this theory 

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:42.159
 winning more - technical language yes 

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:47.349
 what 

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:50.349
 would be the 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.180
 of form 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.159
 is more connections between your cells 

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:57.060
 those who have already built for bricks 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.990
 the brain built by neurons 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.210
 these means of communication 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.870
 many are cells that communicate this many more 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:06.730
 communications 

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:08.349
 and are brain circuits 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:12.479
 at the beginning of the session everything that we have represented everything that is not only the 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:13.400
 condolences 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.400
 emotions feelings our depression 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:18.830
 our joys because we do not 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.729
 so it seems that these people have a smaller capacity to form new 

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:24.809
 circuits 

00:06:24.809 --> 00:06:26.020
 because we know 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.710
 that you form new circuits in the new students 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.050
 always sim 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.050
 the system in europe the city 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.020
 it seems that people are less able to really 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.469
 to do are innocuous city 

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:39.889
 ef 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:41.180
 and they therefore 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.550
 are more vulnerable to having depression not under pressure but problems 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:45.849
 also 

00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:48.990
 including the antidepressants they do today 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.180
 it is a deadlock the capacity 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.099
 or artistic of the senate this thousand by city 

00:06:54.099 --> 00:06:55.259
 take the cerol 

00:06:55.259 --> 00:06:59.839
 more connections so they are taken today six months eight months one 

00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:00.340
 year 

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.389
 to others who argue that these symptoms for two years 

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:07.509
 because they will make brain more celestino hoisted 

00:07:07.509 --> 00:07:08.909
 so that people 

00:07:08.909 --> 00:07:10.139
 plane has life 

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:15.270
 no use fertilizing the brain the depressive and not seek to plant corn 

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:15.990
 life 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:17.319
 go look for what 

00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:21.360
 finally go out to the world to fight with life and to top it rennÃ© 

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.270
 it will not work 

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:25.729
 but this is the role of the remedies is thus the papo 

00:07:25.729 --> 00:07:27.319
 who is attributed to them 

00:07:27.319 --> 00:07:28.050
 on a motors vision
