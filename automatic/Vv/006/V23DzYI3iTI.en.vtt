okay<00:00:00.750> this<00:00:00.930> is<00:00:01.110> the<00:00:01.260> second<00:00:01.770> part<00:00:01.979> of<00:00:02.220> our<00:00:02.310> dual

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
okay this is the second part of our dual

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.289 
okay this is the second part of our dual
boot<00:00:02.939> for<00:00:03.210> windows<00:00:04.490> which<00:00:05.490> restarted<00:00:06.210> the

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
boot for windows which restarted the

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.470 
boot for windows which restarted the
computer<00:00:06.450> and<00:00:07.140> windows<00:00:07.700> file<00:00:08.700> system<00:00:09.120> to<00:00:09.300> see

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
computer and windows file system to see

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.870 
computer and windows file system to see
that<00:00:09.750> something<00:00:10.320> has<00:00:10.500> changed<00:00:10.639> so<00:00:11.639> let's

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
that something has changed so let's

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.959 
that something has changed so let's
check<00:00:12.330> this<00:00:12.570> run<00:00:12.960> and<00:00:13.799> it'll<00:00:13.980> sort<00:00:14.309> itself<00:00:14.460> out

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
check this run and it'll sort itself out

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.400 
check this run and it'll sort itself out
and<00:00:15.770> then<00:00:16.770> it'll<00:00:16.949> boot<00:00:17.220> into<00:00:17.430> windows<00:00:18.410> and

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
and then it'll boot into windows and

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.640 
and then it'll boot into windows and
windows<00:00:20.310> right<00:00:21.000> click<00:00:21.240> on<00:00:21.390> easy<00:00:21.750> BCD<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.470> run

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
windows right click on easy BCD and run

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.990 
windows right click on easy BCD and run
as<00:00:22.859> administrator<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.670> say<00:00:24.630> yes<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:24.930> that<00:00:26.000> and

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
as administrator and say yes to that and

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.990 
as administrator and say yes to that and
then<00:00:27.150> once<00:00:27.359> it<00:00:27.539> boots<00:00:28.039> easy<00:00:29.039> VCT<00:00:29.400> we<00:00:29.670> can<00:00:29.820> make

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
then once it boots easy VCT we can make

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.770 
then once it boots easy VCT we can make
some<00:00:30.210> changes<00:00:32.180> so<00:00:33.180> as<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.360> could<00:00:33.510> see<00:00:33.540> it

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
some changes so as you could see it

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.389 
some changes so as you could see it
booted<00:00:34.110> into<00:00:34.260> Windows<00:00:34.739> it<00:00:34.890> only<00:00:35.190> ignored<00:00:35.910> mint

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
booted into Windows it only ignored mint

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.639 
booted into Windows it only ignored mint
so<00:00:38.399> these<00:00:38.550> are<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.420> default<00:00:39.809> settings<00:00:39.870> that

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
so these are the default settings that

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.590 
so these are the default settings that
we<00:00:40.800> need<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.070> change<00:00:43.579> so<00:00:44.579> what<00:00:45.090> we're<00:00:45.239> gonna<00:00:45.329> do

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
we need to change so what we're gonna do

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.930 
we need to change so what we're gonna do
we're<00:00:45.899> gonna<00:00:45.989> add<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.289> new<00:00:46.559> entry<00:00:46.980> for<00:00:47.219> Linux

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
we're gonna add a new entry for Linux

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.100 
we're gonna add a new entry for Linux
Mint<00:00:48.170> click<00:00:49.170> on<00:00:49.350> Linux<00:00:50.190> we<00:00:51.090> need<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.390> load

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
Mint click on Linux we need to load

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.220 
Mint click on Linux we need to load
grub<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:54.350> then<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:56.309> Lord<00:00:56.640> partition<00:00:57.629> 3

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.670 
grub to and then the Lord partition 3
member<00:00:59.070> SDA<00:00:59.489> 3<00:01:00.079> and<00:01:01.079> then<00:01:01.289> we're<00:01:01.440> just<00:01:01.469> gonna

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
member SDA 3 and then we're just gonna

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.719 
member SDA 3 and then we're just gonna
change<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.219> name<00:01:02.840> and<00:01:04.700> mint<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.939> Linux<00:01:06.479> I

change the name and mint a Linux I

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.280 
change the name and mint a Linux I
suppose<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.880> should<00:01:08.909> be<00:01:09.090> fine<00:01:09.659> it's<00:01:09.840> mint<00:01:10.020> but

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
suppose it should be fine it's mint but

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:17.810 
suppose it should be fine it's mint but
you<00:01:11.010> know<00:01:11.299> take<00:01:12.299> out<00:01:12.450> entry<00:01:16.369> and<00:01:17.369> then<00:01:17.610> view
