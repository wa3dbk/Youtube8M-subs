00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.290
 before that he had closed camp now that's all but the whole thing 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.680
 completely to see if that is nice but I like it anyway but me 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.600
 like it too and hear why the unmistakable sound of the 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.910
 most famous resident of the anton geesinkstraat in utrecht yes because there 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.630
 live and work and therefore basic is number one yes 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.630
 because I was number one in Tokyo the fourth sixth 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.210
 and that is why I also live at number one, number two, the joop sweet milk bank 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.779
 nac was the number two 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.779
 more 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.610
 and at number three about separation church and steel that boom won bronze in Tokyo hey 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.340
 at number three motorbike lady of bekeeilens 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.570
 because every man is dead that is a shelter home 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.610
 yes, because they closely control steel prices 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.749
 disagree I applaud ajax 

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:56.479
 well this week the five candidates became known because of my respect 

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:00.150
 for a presidency of the trio for sure 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.360
 r 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.460
 one of the candidates is the belgian shaq rye, which is quite something for a country 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.880
 he had jacques rye, which is known to us as an absolute honest man 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.220
 That is an absurd ability to govern spears of corruption 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.540
 there seems to me to be totally unsuitable for the presidency of the news 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.730
 what do you mean by that at sea and tiel zeeland is still a big one 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.970
 had a snake pit on the brim filled with bribes and a bribe 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.120
 the new zealand is fur coats that is cool cat city that his escort ladies were 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.460
 those at sea 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.690
 they all became a bit more sober there 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.550
 but i just like it 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.560
 this cannot be complied with, but if you like it why don't you 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.580
 candidate for the presidency system now ambition and 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.450
 but I did put forward a candidate, yes, I also have a letter about that 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.150
 it is a shame because yes at the end of March those british ones I will certainly also post 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.520
 and I also sent the telexes to all the big prize on the head of the 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.580
 whole world yes 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.860
 because I have never heard of it again 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.760
 so what people put on the world 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.040
 this therefore systematically 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.840
 doubting my life cried 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.139
 3 with that flu 

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:12.489
 harare anp people have an interest in that 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.319
 except in the pan 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.629
 are you afraid they scare the letter in which the customer is listed yes 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:20.329
 but the map with the Japanese pecunia 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:24.909
 the storm went up and down and then you don't see so closely I also take 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:28.989
 her husband I so I have applied for a job in Alkmaar with defense with all 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.699
 respect how can a great sportsman if you have what to look for at such a fast 

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:36.439
 rogue beating like that at sea that also has nothing to do with sport 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:37.949
 intent is political 

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:42.099
 it's just a big threshold of machinations from van dow to one of those 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:46.039
 Now you see that the books that they have at sea are construction time so I have all but the 

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:48.409
 balk the holland house and it is 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:50.099
 very cosy 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.209
 it is the holland house that I think is also the septet stalingrad of the 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.909
 good taste because that is not holland house that is karaoke with paul de leeuw 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:02:59.679
 that is mop orchestra that is 

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:02.929
 or it's all sponsored by a manufacturer that is older than with one 

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:04.009
 foam head 

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:06.979
 for that matter it was also fun 

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:11.649
 the staff gives the buyer a series of articles for a spanish woman you may like 

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:12.809
 be there too 

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:15.389
 in living in a country like the Netherlands 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:20.159
 by the way you are also a pipe yourself and erkamps yes i am proud and cello later 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:24.389
 grabbed churches play skipped your argument the bar china and in all sorts 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:25.899
 attitudes 

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:29.799
 you are the reason that has systematically been there all those years 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.019
 taken out and calling 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.829
 just listen sir geesink in the holland house i must be there for 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.719
 my work because of the showers before workdays parties the kloten wielaert 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:44.319
 that appears to be but nevertheless it seems to me that the board seems to use some form of 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.959
 Chairman from 3 to 7 further remains possible but that is nice to 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.579
 had to say 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:52.650
 do not make sense but suggested it would be what is the first thing he 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.999
 is going to do as president well i know exactly what mister geesink is going to do in it 

00:03:55.999 --> 00:04:00.229
 fancy being together in the samandans jansen megalomania it goes here of course 

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:04.260
 trying to play the game to utrecht all involved were from per home 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.309
 and also in the spotlight also a letter written about that a hand 

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:13.309
 at their mother nature alkmaar an exceptionally good wishes left 

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:17.709
 utrecht is a city with an international appeal to yes me 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.709
 think of the dom tower yes and henk westbroek 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.039
 Reindert is also a centrally located yes 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:28.039
 and very occasionally a slip can also be reached by train 

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:32.480
 well late finally coast guard and install 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.730
 this week teams of witch news also received news from yes 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.900
 this week that was again last night have fixed meter 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.070
 after the dramatic farewell to lieke that the quarter before i got me 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.449
 never really as much a family in the league one 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:50.580
 the netherlands draws from the start i always said that martin 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.220
 after more than three months a month in that month in that is not possible at all 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.629
 Singing that the gates up to its interest does not mean that it is singing 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:59.629
 it is also about how many pounds the young and a week have lost 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.710
 so far this broadcast of tonight the following week we have a long one 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.089
