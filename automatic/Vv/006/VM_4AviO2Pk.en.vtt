here's<00:02:36.310> another<00:02:36.580> tip<00:02:36.910> I<00:02:37.030> have<00:02:37.060> to<00:02:37.210> make<00:02:37.390> things

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
here's another tip I have to make things

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.020 
here's another tip I have to make things
a<00:02:37.720> little<00:02:37.900> bit<00:02:38.050> easier<00:02:38.260> as<00:02:39.070> you<00:02:39.130> fly<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:39.730> iron

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
a little bit easier as you fly the iron

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.970 
a little bit easier as you fly the iron
over<00:02:40.390> your<00:02:40.570> hair<00:02:40.810> instead<00:02:41.440> of<00:02:41.590> holding<00:02:41.770> the

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
over your hair instead of holding the

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.830 
over your hair instead of holding the
ends<00:02:42.250> of<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:42.340> hair<00:02:42.430> straight<00:02:42.880> out<00:02:43.060> to<00:02:43.600> hold

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
ends of the hair straight out to hold

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.080 
ends of the hair straight out to hold
the<00:02:43.960> ends<00:02:44.290> in<00:02:44.380> towards<00:02:44.770> you<00:02:44.980> this<00:02:45.700> helps<00:02:46.000> the

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
the ends in towards you this helps the

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.580 
the ends in towards you this helps the
hair<00:02:46.240> curl<00:02:46.510> a<00:02:46.630> bit<00:02:46.780> easier<00:02:47.170> because<00:02:47.320> it's

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
hair curl a bit easier because it's

00:02:47.590 --> 00:03:10.020 
hair curl a bit easier because it's
wrapped<00:02:47.830> around<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.190> flat<00:02:48.400> iron

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.550 

when<00:03:11.030> you're<00:03:11.180> finished<00:03:11.600> loosen<00:03:12.290> the<00:03:12.320> hair

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
when you're finished loosen the hair

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.870 
when you're finished loosen the hair
with<00:03:12.680> your<00:03:12.830> fingers<00:03:13.220> and<00:03:13.250> set<00:03:13.670> it<00:03:13.790> with

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
with your fingers and set it with

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:33.830 
with your fingers and set it with
hairspray

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.390 

so<00:03:34.840> as<00:03:34.989> you<00:03:35.170> can<00:03:35.290> see<00:03:35.590> you<00:03:36.040> don't<00:03:36.220> necessarily

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
so as you can see you don't necessarily

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.339 
so as you can see you don't necessarily
need<00:03:36.940> a<00:03:37.060> curling<00:03:37.360> iron<00:03:37.599> if<00:03:37.900> you<00:03:37.959> have<00:03:38.049> a<00:03:38.110> flat

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
need a curling iron if you have a flat

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.510 
need a curling iron if you have a flat
iron
