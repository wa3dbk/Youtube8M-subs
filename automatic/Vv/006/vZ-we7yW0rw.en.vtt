00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
most shots on to the juggernaut but he

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.950 
most shots on to the juggernaut but he
didn't<00:00:20.460> spawn<00:00:20.699> there<00:00:20.970> that<00:00:21.119> time<00:00:21.330> most<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.869> the

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
didn't spawn there that time most of the

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.450 
didn't spawn there that time most of the
times<00:00:22.199> there<00:00:22.590> will<00:00:22.650> be<00:00:22.769> a<00:00:22.800> jarring<00:00:23.070> out<00:00:23.250> there

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
times there will be a jarring out there

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.550 
times there will be a jarring out there
you<00:00:24.210> turn<00:00:24.449> your<00:00:24.480> right<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.170> it'll<00:00:25.320> most

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
you turn your right and it'll most

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.330 
you turn your right and it'll most
likely<00:00:25.680> be<00:00:25.980> here<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:27.800> wouldn't<00:00:28.800> be<00:00:28.949> there<00:00:29.130> that

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
likely be here I wouldn't be there that

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.110 
likely be here I wouldn't be there that
soon<00:00:29.369> but<00:00:30.029> be<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.300> little<00:00:30.420> ahead<00:00:30.779> in<00:00:31.109> that<00:00:31.260> trail

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:32.120 
soon but be a little ahead in that trail

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.850 
soon but be a little ahead in that trail
so<00:00:33.120> this<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.360> going<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.690> be<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.809> big<00:00:34.140> game<00:00:34.410> with

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
so this is going to be a big game with

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.340 
so this is going to be a big game with
the<00:00:35.010> thumper<00:00:35.399> at<00:00:35.489> least<00:00:35.700> pre<00:00:36.600> firing<00:00:37.050> around

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
the thumper at least pre firing around

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.799 
the thumper at least pre firing around
the<00:00:37.469> corners<00:00:37.860> if<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.760> were<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.969> take<00:00:39.120> an<00:00:39.300> RPG

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
the corners if you were to take an RPG

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.690 
the corners if you were to take an RPG
approached<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.800> would<00:00:40.890> be<00:00:40.920> taking<00:00:41.610> a

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
approached and it would be taking a

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.880 
approached and it would be taking a
flashbang<00:00:42.300> stunning<00:00:42.840> them<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.140> then<00:00:43.649> hitting

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
flashbang stunning them and then hitting

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.799 
flashbang stunning them and then hitting
them<00:00:44.070> dead<00:00:44.309> on<00:00:44.460> like<00:00:44.730> direct<00:00:45.090> impact<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.719> the

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
them dead on like direct impact of the

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:52.400 
them dead on like direct impact of the
rocket<00:00:47.989> I'd<00:00:48.989> say<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.440> RPG<00:00:50.340> route<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:51.410> more

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
rocket I'd say the RPG route is more

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.680 
rocket I'd say the RPG route is more
tactical<00:00:54.050> but<00:00:55.550> you<00:00:56.550> need<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.969> make<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.360> load<00:00:57.660> of

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
tactical but you need to make a load of

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.810 
tactical but you need to make a load of
visits<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.500> ammo<00:00:58.710> crate<00:00:59.129> so<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.460> need<00:00:59.699> to

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
visits to the ammo crate so you need to

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.970 
visits to the ammo crate so you need to
have<00:01:00.000> this<00:01:00.180> like<00:01:00.420> whole<00:01:00.690> map<00:01:00.960> on<00:01:01.260> memory<00:01:01.710> no

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
have this like whole map on memory no

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.000 
have this like whole map on memory no
radar<00:01:02.250> needed<00:01:03.260> but<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.409> really<00:01:04.619> need<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.920> know

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
radar needed but you really need to know

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.929 
radar needed but you really need to know
inside<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.729> out<00:01:06.920> this<00:01:07.920> bumper<00:01:08.340> one<00:01:08.549> is<00:01:08.729> better

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
inside and out this bumper one is better

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.320 
inside and out this bumper one is better
for<00:01:09.090> an<00:01:09.390> on-the-fly<00:01:09.810> just<00:01:11.180> hit<00:01:12.180> the

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
for an on-the-fly just hit the

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.969 
for an on-the-fly just hit the
juggernauts<00:01:12.840> wherever<00:01:13.260> they<00:01:13.409> fall<00:01:13.650> in<00:01:13.830> place

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
juggernauts wherever they fall in place

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.380 
juggernauts wherever they fall in place
and<00:01:14.689> that's<00:01:15.689> my<00:01:16.560> playstyle<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.580> it's<00:01:18.180> what<00:01:18.360> I

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
and that's my playstyle so it's what I

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.190 
and that's my playstyle so it's what I
do

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.840 

and<00:01:22.200> there's<00:01:22.800> a<00:01:22.890> noise<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.550> know<00:01:23.640> he's

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
and there's a noise so I know he's

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.420 
and there's a noise so I know he's
coming<00:01:24.030> somewhere<00:01:24.500> being<00:01:25.500> in<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.680> spawn<00:01:26.100> is

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
coming somewhere being in the spawn is

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.760 
coming somewhere being in the spawn is
not<00:01:26.760> a<00:01:26.790> good<00:01:27.030> spot<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.390> be<00:01:27.720> but<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.350> already

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
not a good spot to be but I already

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.070 
not a good spot to be but I already
remember<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.420> this<00:01:30.600> guy's<00:01:30.840> going<00:01:31.050> to

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
remember and that this guy's going to

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.630 
remember and that this guy's going to
come<00:01:31.320> somewhere<00:01:31.560> around<00:01:31.800> that<00:01:32.130> way<00:01:33.500> and<00:01:34.640> I

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
come somewhere around that way and I

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.280 
come somewhere around that way and I
it's<00:01:35.820> kind<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.120> forced<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.600> have<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:36.780> there<00:01:37.080> so

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
it's kind of forced to have it there so

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.210 
it's kind of forced to have it there so
I<00:01:37.320> just<00:01:37.350> use<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.800> flash<00:01:38.130> bang<00:01:38.160> make<00:01:38.760> my<00:01:38.940> escape<00:01:39.180> I

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
I just use a flash bang make my escape I

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.920 
I just use a flash bang make my escape I
really<00:01:41.220> I'm<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.670> conservative<00:01:42.150> player<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.630> don't

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
easy to hit them just like this when

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.920 
easy to hit them just like this when
they<00:03:07.730> have<00:03:07.819> to<00:03:07.970> go<00:03:08.060> around<00:03:08.299> that<00:03:08.390> corner<00:03:08.660> you

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
they have to go around that corner you

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.160 
they have to go around that corner you
just<00:03:09.200> hear<00:03:09.470> them<00:03:09.620> react<00:03:10.720> just<00:03:11.720> keep<00:03:11.959> hitting

them

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.520 

and<00:03:17.910> this<00:03:18.910> I<00:03:19.240> don't<00:03:19.810> think<00:03:19.870> of<00:03:20.140> any<00:03:20.290> of<00:03:20.410> those

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
and this I don't think of any of those

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.670 
and this I don't think of any of those
hit<00:03:21.540> because<00:03:22.540> when<00:03:22.750> you<00:03:22.840> get<00:03:22.960> shot<00:03:23.260> you're<00:03:23.530> in

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
hit because when you get shot you're in

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.000 
hit because when you get shot you're in
just<00:03:23.980> throwing<00:03:24.280> on<00:03:25.320> actually<00:03:26.320> speaking<00:03:26.770> of

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
just throwing on actually speaking of

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.850 
just throwing on actually speaking of
that<00:03:27.190> I'll<00:03:27.520> actually<00:03:27.760> get<00:03:28.090> to<00:03:28.150> this<00:03:28.530> it's<00:03:29.530> a

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
that I'll actually get to this it's a

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.770 
that I'll actually get to this it's a
lot<00:03:30.220> easier<00:03:30.250> to<00:03:30.730> need<00:03:31.090> to<00:03:31.300> do<00:03:31.450> it<00:03:31.540> at<00:03:31.630> some

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
lot easier to need to do it at some

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.950 
lot easier to need to do it at some
single<00:03:32.170> player<00:03:32.350> then<00:03:32.860> it<00:03:32.980> isn't<00:03:33.130> co-op

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960 
single player then it isn't co-op

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.480 
single player then it isn't co-op
because<00:03:34.960> your<00:03:35.260> aim<00:03:35.380> gets<00:03:35.650> thrown<00:03:35.950> off<00:03:36.190> like

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.490 
because your aim gets thrown off like

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.880 
because your aim gets thrown off like
all<00:03:36.850> the<00:03:37.150> way<00:03:37.390> to<00:03:37.450> the<00:03:37.870> sky<00:03:38.140> when<00:03:38.440> you<00:03:38.470> get<00:03:38.650> shot

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
all the way to the sky when you get shot

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.690 
all the way to the sky when you get shot
one<00:03:39.280> bullet<00:03:39.600> this<00:03:40.600> one<00:03:40.960> is<00:03:41.290> suits<00:03:42.070> up<00:03:42.280> a<00:03:42.430> lot

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
one bullet this one is suits up a lot

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.560 
one bullet this one is suits up a lot
and<00:03:43.000> I<00:03:43.120> hate<00:03:43.360> it<00:03:43.540> but<00:03:44.580> it's<00:03:45.580> not<00:03:46.090> to<00:03:46.270> the<00:03:46.390> point

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
and I hate it but it's not to the point

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:51.810 
and I hate it but it's not to the point
that<00:03:46.690> you<00:03:46.870> can't<00:03:47.140> even<00:03:47.200> see<00:03:47.590> anything<00:03:50.280> guy<00:03:51.280> was

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
that you can't even see anything guy was

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.280 
that you can't even see anything guy was
lucky<00:03:52.240> to<00:03:52.360> live<00:03:52.540> there<00:03:52.990> but<00:03:53.980> I<00:03:55.140> deserve<00:03:56.140> the

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
lucky to live there but I deserve the

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.630 
lucky to live there but I deserve the
luck<00:03:56.500> when<00:03:56.680> I<00:03:56.740> got<00:03:56.890> shot<00:03:56.920> in<00:03:57.250> three<00:03:57.490> different

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
luck when I got shot in three different

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.480 
luck when I got shot in three different
directions<00:03:57.820> that<00:03:58.480> flash<00:03:59.440> bang<00:03:59.770> stunned<00:04:00.190> one

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:00.490 
directions that flash bang stunned one

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.100 
directions that flash bang stunned one
of<00:04:00.640> them<00:04:00.790> which<00:04:01.210> was<00:04:01.420> enough<00:04:01.660> for<00:04:01.690> me<00:04:01.870> to<00:04:01.990> get

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
of them which was enough for me to get

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.920 
of them which was enough for me to get
out<00:04:02.700> and<00:04:03.700> now<00:04:04.060> I<00:04:04.090> have<00:04:04.330> them<00:04:04.480> right<00:04:04.510> where<00:04:04.720> I

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
out and now I have them right where I

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.250 
out and now I have them right where I
want<00:04:05.200> them<00:04:05.290> again<00:04:05.590> all<00:04:06.100> bunched<00:04:06.730> up<00:04:07.260> one

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
want them again all bunched up one

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.590 
want them again all bunched up one
direction<00:04:08.440> of<00:04:08.860> fire<00:04:09.840> right<00:04:10.840> in<00:04:10.990> the<00:04:11.140> alley<00:04:11.350> to

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.560 

and<00:04:15.550> just<00:04:16.990> keep<00:04:17.990> running<00:04:18.350> around<00:04:18.740> the<00:04:18.890> place

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
and just keep running around the place

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.820 
and just keep running around the place
from<00:04:20.570> this<00:04:20.720> point<00:04:21.020> there's<00:04:21.260> a<00:04:21.320> bunch<00:04:21.620> of<00:04:21.770> them

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:21.830 
from this point there's a bunch of them

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:24.550 
from this point there's a bunch of them
on<00:04:22.100> me<00:04:22.340> I<00:04:22.640> think<00:04:23.600> I<00:04:23.780> just<00:04:23.810> heard<00:04:24.200> that<00:04:24.380> noise

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
on me I think I just heard that noise

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.020 
on me I think I just heard that noise
again<00:04:24.860> so<00:04:25.190> there's<00:04:25.370> another<00:04:25.640> one<00:04:25.850> coming

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
again so there's another one coming

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.340 
again so there's another one coming
somewhere<00:04:27.400> and<00:04:28.420> I<00:04:29.420> think<00:04:29.690> there's<00:04:29.870> one<00:04:29.930> more

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:36.820 
somewhere and I think there's one more
that's<00:04:30.650> still<00:04:30.980> not<00:04:31.160> active<00:04:31.640> yet<00:04:31.670> so<00:04:35.830> nevermind

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
that's still not active yet so nevermind

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:42.610 
that's still not active yet so nevermind

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.640 
got killed again because came at me from
a<00:04:45.710> different<00:04:45.890> angle<00:04:47.020> but<00:04:48.020> at<00:04:48.140> least<00:04:48.290> I<00:04:48.500> got

finding<00:05:25.390> my<00:05:25.480> way<00:05:25.690> to<00:05:25.750> an<00:05:25.990> ammo<00:05:26.170> crate<00:05:27.390> which<00:05:28.390> I

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:28.540 
finding my way to an ammo crate which I

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.450 
finding my way to an ammo crate which I
remember<00:05:28.990> that<00:05:29.170> one<00:05:29.410> off<00:05:29.620> hand<00:05:29.860> at<00:05:30.010> least<00:05:30.250> I

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
remember that one off hand at least I

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.370 
remember that one off hand at least I
think<00:05:33.460> I<00:05:33.850> heard<00:05:33.910> that<00:05:34.180> noise<00:05:34.390> so<00:05:34.900> i<00:05:34.930> guess<00:05:35.200> the

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
think I heard that noise so i guess the

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.830 
think I heard that noise so i guess the
flashbang<00:05:35.860> effective<00:05:36.370> going<00:05:36.610> and<00:05:37.480> i<00:05:37.600> think

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 
flashbang effective going and i think

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.050 
flashbang effective going and i think
that<00:05:38.020> was<00:05:38.140> my<00:05:38.320> last<00:05:38.620> little<00:05:39.130> escape<00:05:39.670> this
