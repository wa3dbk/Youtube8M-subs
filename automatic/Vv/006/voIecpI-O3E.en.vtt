00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:13.799
 microsoft launches in the universe of 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.299
 portable devices its surface a 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.460
 device that according to expectations 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.490
 should go to enhance his 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.199
 last creation ie windows 8 is 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.150
 available in two different variants 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.970
 that stand out both for the part 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.769
 hardware for that software 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.970
 microsoft surface to appearance and le 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.520
 size of a tablet 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.050
 the structure is solid and very compact 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.660
 but this device is at all 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.149
 indeed a laptop is transformed 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.700
 in a PC via a touch keyboard 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.040
 sold separately and a support 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.860
 back which can support the 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.930
 display a hybrid nature designed 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.210
 specifically to express the best 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.820
 the peculiarities that the operating system 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.860
 brings dowry the hardware is 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.770
 summarized in the technical sheet and how 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.140
 you can see it is highly respected besides 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.030
 to the nvidia tegra 3 processor paired 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.640
 the two gigabytes of ram they make 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.260
 this snappy device we can 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.960
 find different communication ports 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.600
 that allow you to connect the little one 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.159
 laptops to different devices including a 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.040
 external monitor 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.990
 windows 8 in its rt excellent version 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.240
 data for tablets is really 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.130
 snappy and versatile 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.170
 remember that the only applications 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.390
 installable are those of the store but 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.220
 in any case, Microsoft is working hard 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.530
 to bring it to the levels of the 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.380
 competition as we can see we have 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.630
 really available everything from the weather and 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.329
 the news to the music and if that were not enough 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.280
 it will be possible to resort to the classic 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.369
 desktop interface through which 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.689
 work with office in complete safety 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.030
 everything has been carefully 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.280
 designed and now sky support 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.720
 drive allows you to work in the cloud 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.189
 improving productivity e 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.450
 interaction with other devices 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:02:00.210
 microsoft useless maybe impossible to do 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.579
 of the surface comparisons in fact escapes 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.710
 from the antecedent categories and for this 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.049
 reason you end up considering it 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.970
 better worse than other devices 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.650
 only according to the points of 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.120
 more similar reference 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.400
 microsoft in any case has played a 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.470
 really great job creating this 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.170
 device that revolutionizes the concept 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.800
 of laptops as we are used to 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.800
 see him
