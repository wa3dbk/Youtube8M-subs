indicator looks like a flat tire with an

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.450 
indicator looks like a flat tire with an
exclamation<00:00:15.389> mark<00:00:16.070> pictured<00:00:17.070> there<00:00:17.250> on<00:00:17.369> the

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
exclamation mark pictured there on the

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.279 
exclamation mark pictured there on the
dashboard<00:00:17.970> now<00:00:18.150> there<00:00:18.359> is<00:00:18.480> also<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.779> button

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
dashboard now there is also a button

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.640 
dashboard now there is also a button
which<00:00:19.949> is<00:00:19.980> there<00:00:20.570> in<00:00:21.570> your<00:00:21.810> center<00:00:22.230> console

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
which is there in your center console

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.429 
which is there in your center console
just<00:00:23.609> underneath<00:00:24.000> your<00:00:24.240> climate<00:00:24.600> control<00:00:24.930> now

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
just underneath your climate control now

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.890 
just underneath your climate control now
what<00:00:26.220> happens<00:00:26.519> is<00:00:26.670> when<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.269> tire<00:00:27.570> pressure

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
what happens is when the tire pressure

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.589 
what happens is when the tire pressure
drops<00:00:28.289> this<00:00:29.279> indicator<00:00:29.820> comes<00:00:30.119> up<00:00:30.390> on<00:00:30.539> the

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
drops this indicator comes up on the

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.620 
drops this indicator comes up on the
dashboard<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:32.369> senses<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:33.059> one<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.390> tire

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
dashboard it senses that one of the tire

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.299 
dashboard it senses that one of the tire
pressures<00:00:34.050> has<00:00:34.200> dropped<00:00:34.469> significantly<00:00:34.680> so

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
pressures has dropped significantly so

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.100 
pressures has dropped significantly so
this<00:00:35.460> usually<00:00:35.790> happens<00:00:36.180> due<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.840> flat<00:00:37.500> tire

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
this usually happens due to a flat tire

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.660 
this usually happens due to a flat tire
sometimes<00:00:40.110> occasionally<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:41.370> can<00:00:41.489> get<00:00:41.640> a

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
sometimes occasionally you can get a

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.010 
sometimes occasionally you can get a
glitch<00:00:41.879> in<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.059> system<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.690> light<00:00:42.840> will

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
glitch in the system and the light will

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.299 
glitch in the system and the light will
come<00:00:43.170> on<00:00:43.230> anyway<00:00:43.559> so<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.890> first<00:00:44.100> thing<00:00:44.250> you

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
come on anyway so the first thing you

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.860 
come on anyway so the first thing you
need<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.489> do<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:44.760> go<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.120> service<00:00:45.480> station

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
need to do is go to a service station

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.420 
need to do is go to a service station
and<00:00:45.960> check<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.649> tire<00:00:46.860> pressures<00:00:47.280> now

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
and check the tire pressures now

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.080 
and check the tire pressures now
generally<00:00:48.059> around<00:00:48.930> 34<00:00:49.649> psi<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.370> good<00:00:50.579> good

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
generally around 34 psi is a good good

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.020 
generally around 34 psi is a good good
pressure<00:00:51.329> for<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.690> x5<00:00:52.100> so<00:00:53.100> just<00:00:53.550> check<00:00:53.910> that

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
pressure for the x5 so just check that

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.819 
pressure for the x5 so just check that
all<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.360> tires<00:00:54.600> are<00:00:54.780> evenly<00:00:55.140> inflated<00:00:55.710> to

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
all the tires are evenly inflated to

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.700 
all the tires are evenly inflated to
around<00:00:56.070> 34<00:00:56.760> psi<00:00:57.239> once<00:00:57.960> you've<00:00:58.109> done<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.350> and

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
around 34 psi once you've done that and

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.650 
around 34 psi once you've done that and
you're<00:00:58.980> happy<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.460> none<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.390> them<00:01:00.570> are

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
you're happy that none of them are

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.569 
you're happy that none of them are
leaking<00:01:00.899> significantly<00:01:01.680> what<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.340> need<00:01:02.489> to

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
leaking significantly what you need to

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.039 
leaking significantly what you need to
do<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.239> start<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.229> car<00:01:05.450> before<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.689> set

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
do is is start the car before you set

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.320 
do is is start the car before you set
off<00:01:07.080> on<00:01:07.320> your<00:01:07.439> journey<00:01:07.500> now<00:01:08.210> after<00:01:09.210> you've

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
what will happen is the indicator should

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.300 
what will happen is the indicator should
flash<00:01:27.710> and<00:01:28.880> then<00:01:29.880> it'll<00:01:30.060> go<00:01:30.240> yellow<00:01:30.570> like<00:01:30.990> that

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
flash and then it'll go yellow like that

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.649 
flash and then it'll go yellow like that
in<00:01:32.310> some<00:01:32.520> cases<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:33.030> will<00:01:33.090> go<00:01:33.270> away<00:01:33.450> if<00:01:33.570> it

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
in some cases it will go away if it

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:34.999 
in some cases it will go away if it
doesn't<00:01:33.869> go<00:01:33.960> away<00:01:33.990> straight<00:01:34.470> away<00:01:34.710> then<00:01:34.920> what

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
doesn't go away straight away then what

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.840 
doesn't go away straight away then what
you<00:01:35.100> need<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.970> do<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.420> need<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.630> drive<00:01:37.049> off

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
you need to do is you need to drive off

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.030 
you need to do is you need to drive off
after<00:01:39.259> driving<00:01:40.259> for<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.560> couple<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:40.890> hundred

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
after driving for a couple of hundred

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.240 
after driving for a couple of hundred
meters<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:42.439> system<00:01:43.439> should<00:01:43.590> recalibrate

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
meters the system should recalibrate

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.670 
meters the system should recalibrate
itself<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.759> light<00:01:44.970> should<00:01:45.149> go<00:01:45.299> away<00:01:45.680> if

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
itself and a light should go away if

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.889 
itself and a light should go away if
that<00:01:46.890> doesn't<00:01:47.220> happen<00:01:47.310> then<00:01:47.850> try<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.630> whole

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
that doesn't happen then try the whole

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.350 
that doesn't happen then try the whole
process<00:01:49.290> again<00:01:49.759> maybe<00:01:50.759> check<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.180> tire

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
process again maybe check the tire

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.940 
process again maybe check the tire
pressures<00:01:51.750> if<00:01:51.869> they<00:01:52.020> have<00:01:52.259> gone<00:01:52.409> down<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.860> you

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
pressures if they have gone down and you

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.280 
pressures if they have gone down and you
definitely<00:01:53.399> have<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.549> fault<00:01:53.939> otherwise<00:01:54.750> there

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
definitely have a fault otherwise there

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.719 
definitely have a fault otherwise there
could<00:01:55.470> be<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.619> fault<00:01:55.890> with<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.130> system<00:01:56.549> and

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
could be a fault with the system and

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.350 
could be a fault with the system and
it's<00:01:57.390> recommended<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:58.170> book<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:58.500> into<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:59.360> BMW
