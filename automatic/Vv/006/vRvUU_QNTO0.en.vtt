00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:43.760
 its popular ac type is what it is 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:51.170

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.299
 Well, that was the video, it 's not a skull. 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:02.420
 I was waiting for the game to be so weird. 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:04.940
 so an aimless and finished nothing else 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.660
 I will be was kind of a demo something 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.640

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.870
 code will pass a type of modification 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.940
 of thing but I will be a business 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.769
 liked the video guys if you liked 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.070
 evaluation is that the course 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.870
 the one that is favorite and a comment is not 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.900
 and give a suggestion of the game that I can 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.430
 buy to play with you there and tell me 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.860

 tell me what you say about the game 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.660
 and in the comments I honestly found 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.139
 I found it sounded but I think it should be 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:44.300
 some kind of demo I do not know why not 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.610
 does not aim to make such a game 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.650
 without rhyme or liked the video and 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.240
