decorative piece to attaching the ribbon

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.800 
decorative piece to attaching the ribbon
you<00:03:58.900> can<00:03:59.109> use<00:03:59.319> glue<00:03:59.680> which<00:04:00.669> some<00:04:01.209> people<00:04:01.569> use

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
you can use glue which some people use

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.259 
you can use glue which some people use
like<00:04:02.319> a<00:04:02.709> hot<00:04:03.069> gun<00:04:03.340> or<00:04:03.639> something<00:04:03.909> like<00:04:04.030> that

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
like a hot gun or something like that

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.949 
like a hot gun or something like that
but<00:04:04.840> I<00:04:05.290> just<00:04:05.590> find<00:04:06.190> that<00:04:06.760> sometimes<00:04:07.299> depending

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
but I just find that sometimes depending

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.080 
but I just find that sometimes depending
on<00:04:08.079> the<00:04:08.139> ribbon<00:04:08.500> that<00:04:08.620> you<00:04:08.680> use<00:04:09.040> you'll<00:04:09.699> see

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
on the ribbon that you use you'll see

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.289 
on the ribbon that you use you'll see
the<00:04:10.359> glue<00:04:10.569> if<00:04:10.959> you're<00:04:11.620> not<00:04:11.889> really<00:04:12.299> very

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
the glue if you're not really very

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:16.770 
the glue if you're not really very
crafty<00:04:14.109> then<00:04:14.769> the<00:04:15.400> glue<00:04:15.699> can<00:04:16.239> end<00:04:16.479> up<00:04:16.599> looking

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
crafty then the glue can end up looking

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.140 
crafty then the glue can end up looking
clumped<00:04:17.500> and<00:04:17.650> you<00:04:18.430> can<00:04:18.579> see<00:04:18.789> it<00:04:18.909> through<00:04:19.060> the

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
clumped and you can see it through the

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.490 
clumped and you can see it through the
ribbon<00:04:19.419> so

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
ribbon so

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.980 
ribbon so
I<00:04:21.560> just<00:04:22.010> prefer<00:04:22.250> to<00:04:22.490> sometimes<00:04:23.390> just<00:04:23.480> use<00:04:23.780> like

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
I just prefer to sometimes just use like

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.080 
I just prefer to sometimes just use like
a<00:04:24.050> double-sided<00:04:24.650> tape<00:04:25.070> just<00:04:25.400> to<00:04:25.640> hold<00:04:25.670> it<00:04:25.970> in

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
a double-sided tape just to hold it in

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.350 
a double-sided tape just to hold it in
place

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
place

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.510 
place
and<00:04:26.540> then<00:04:27.050> pin<00:04:27.470> it<00:04:27.500> this<00:04:27.770> is<00:04:27.950> gonna<00:04:28.100> be<00:04:28.340> like

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
and then pin it this is gonna be like

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.310 
and then pin it this is gonna be like
your<00:04:28.700> best<00:04:29.000> bet<00:04:29.300> it's<00:04:29.720> gonna<00:04:29.930> give<00:04:30.140> you<00:04:30.290> a

we're going to be cutting them with
something<00:04:41.630> like<00:04:41.810> this<00:04:42.550> which<00:04:43.550> is<00:04:44.170> a<00:04:45.170> wire

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
something like this which is a wire

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.090 
something like this which is a wire
cutter<00:04:46.490> and<00:04:46.850> this<00:04:47.420> is<00:04:47.720> also<00:04:48.410> you<00:04:48.470> can<00:04:48.710> find<00:04:48.920> in

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
cutter and this is also you can find in

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.540 
cutter and this is also you can find in
the<00:04:49.280> jewelry<00:04:49.700> making<00:04:50.500> section<00:04:51.500> and<00:04:52.250> it's

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
the jewelry making section and it's

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.470 
the jewelry making section and it's
going<00:04:52.880> to<00:04:53.000> be<00:04:53.570> used<00:04:53.810> to<00:04:54.140> cut<00:04:54.620> the<00:04:55.480> boutonniere

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
going to be used to cut the boutonniere

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.930 
going to be used to cut the boutonniere
pins<00:04:56.720> which<00:04:57.050> I<00:04:57.200> have<00:04:57.380> right<00:04:57.620> here<00:04:58.070> again<00:04:58.640> one

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
pins which I have right here again one

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.730 
pins which I have right here again one
that<00:04:59.150> I've<00:04:59.510> cut<00:05:00.050> that's<00:05:00.290> a<00:05:00.410> little<00:05:00.620> bit

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
that I've cut that's a little bit

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.170 
that I've cut that's a little bit
shorter<00:05:01.100> because<00:05:01.190> what<00:05:01.550> happens<00:05:01.940> is

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
shorter because what happens is

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.730 
shorter because what happens is
depending<00:05:03.169> on<00:05:03.700> how<00:05:04.700> cool<00:05:05.510> the<00:05:05.900> candle<00:05:06.320> is<00:05:06.470> if

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
depending on how cool the candle is if

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.350 
depending on how cool the candle is if
you<00:05:06.860> can<00:05:07.040> heat<00:05:07.310> it<00:05:07.340> up<00:05:07.550> a<00:05:07.700> little<00:05:07.880> bit<00:05:08.150> with

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
you can heat it up a little bit with

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.360 
you can heat it up a little bit with
like<00:05:08.630> a<00:05:09.370> embossing<00:05:10.540> hot<00:05:11.540> gun<00:05:11.860> but<00:05:12.860> you<00:05:12.890> don't

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
like a embossing hot gun but you don't

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.400 
like a embossing hot gun but you don't
want<00:05:13.580> them<00:05:13.700> to<00:05:13.820> be<00:05:13.940> too<00:05:14.270> long<00:05:14.540> because<00:05:14.960> you

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.410 
want them to be too long because you

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.220 
want them to be too long because you
don't<00:05:15.590> want<00:05:15.860> to<00:05:16.040> start<00:05:16.400> having<00:05:16.970> cracks<00:05:17.600> in<00:05:17.960> the

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:18.230 
don't want to start having cracks in the

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:19.720 
don't want to start having cracks in the
candle<00:05:18.620> so<00:05:18.800> the<00:05:18.980> shorter<00:05:19.340> they<00:05:19.460> are<00:05:19.610> the

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
candle so the shorter they are the

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.400 
candle so the shorter they are the
better<00:05:19.850> you<00:05:20.060> just<00:05:20.270> want<00:05:20.450> them<00:05:20.660> to<00:05:20.840> be<00:05:21.080> able<00:05:21.260> to

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
better you just want them to be able to

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.560 
better you just want them to be able to
pierce<00:05:21.800> through<00:05:22.010> the<00:05:22.100> ribbon<00:05:22.550> go<00:05:22.790> through<00:05:23.360> and
