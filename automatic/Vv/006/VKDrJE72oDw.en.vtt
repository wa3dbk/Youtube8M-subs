 say everything 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.420
 the structure is very good teachers 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.369
 are excellent the material already feels 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.380
 well if you do not take the right place to 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.030
 study then you end up being motivated 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.590
 but still not the one I felt 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.540
 competition we can feel like mine. 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.420
 friends was also not so helpful to the 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.350

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.310
 the coordinators themselves with the 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.490
 psychologists everybody a support like this 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.350
 always talking always guiding 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.570
 they valued it quite a lot we know 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.970
 clearly not with one more was 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.229
 initially approved the look our side 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.060
 listen to what you were feeling 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.189
 problem at home but he was there to 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.140
 listening could also help the 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.180
 teachers are very good 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.970
 always focusing on what will fall on the 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.920
 students know that the student passes it 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.869
 You know what you need to get through 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.640
 vestibular interaction between them 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.380
 with the students that person arrives at the 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.750
 shop goes away they do not interact it is 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.119
 listen to students to take doubt 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.189
 talk when you were in the race and had 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.930
 the question was reminding the 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.560
 teacher how then will this fall not 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.000
 it will fall 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.429
 these things we remember that at the time 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.840
 that being said it is easy as well 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.459
 It's cool that it shows who really 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.350
 prepared to pass the entrance exam 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.090
 recommends not only the pac polyhedron 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.520
 No one will ever travel with 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.550
 resource that is to do what you look at it 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.780
 has everything you need not only for 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.790
 content for you to pass the entrance exam 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.530
 but the whole structure also for you 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.450
 get confident in the vestibular part 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.980
 that the vestibular is only 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.870
 studying you also need to work 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.640
 with pressure to work with all this 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.560
 part behind and reap a lot work 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.260
 well this was more accurate measurement was 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.720
 spoon was a very wonderful year 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.340
 study dedication but it was worth it 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.750
 It was delicious, that little thing, I want to go out. 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.220
 Yes, I think she went through the 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.480
 college but it was not a heavy climate 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.480
 it was not very tasty
