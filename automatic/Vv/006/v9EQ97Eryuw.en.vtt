00:00:00.115 --> 00:00:01.860
D: Hey guys welcome to Off the Great Wall. I'm Dan&nbsp;

00:00:01.965 --> 00:00:02.445
M: I am&nbsp;Mike.

00:00:02.782 --> 00:00:06.165
D: and around the holiday times why don't we&nbsp;wish everybody a happy holiday.

00:00:06.185 --> 00:00:06.625
M: That's&nbsp;right.

00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:16.144
D: And we got a lot of something special&nbsp;for you guys. You know the story ...what's that&nbsp;story? Twas the night before Christmas went all&nbsp;through the house.&nbsp;Not a creature was stirring not even a ...

00:00:16.831 --> 00:00:17.196
M: Dragon?

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:18.700
D: What?!

00:00:19.034 --> 00:00:24.740
M: Well we have our own&nbsp;adaptation of that fun little story. Here it is. Check it out.

00:00:25.187 --> 00:00:28.571
Twas the night before Christmas went all&nbsp;through the house.&nbsp;

00:00:28.787 --> 00:00:31.590
Not a creature was stirring not even a&nbsp;mouse.

00:00:31.925 --> 00:00:34.968
The swim milken mochi were set out with&nbsp;care

00:00:35.525 --> 00:00:38.789
In hopes that old men Christmas soon&nbsp;will be there

00:00:39.128 --> 00:00:44.599
The children had finished their homework&nbsp;in bed while visions of bubble tea&nbsp;dance in their head.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:51.563
And mom in her curlers&nbsp;and I in my cap had just settled down for&nbsp;a long winter's nap

00:00:51.784 --> 00:00:54.354
When out on the street came a crash of&nbsp;a gongs

00:00:54.919 --> 00:00:57.952
I went to the window to&nbsp;see what's going on

00:00:58.512 --> 00:01:01.671
And I saw in the&nbsp;moonlight&nbsp;clear as day

00:01:01.884 --> 00:01:05.270
Two silvery dragons&nbsp;and a long golden sleigh

00:01:05.713 --> 00:01:08.748
With a little&nbsp;old driver and eight tiny&nbsp;mask elves

00:01:09.199 --> 00:01:12.001
I knew right away twas the&nbsp;old man himself

00:01:12.448 --> 00:01:15.369
They land on the rooftop with hardly a&nbsp;sound&nbsp;

00:01:15.931 --> 00:01:19.086
8&nbsp;tiny black ropes make their way to the ground

00:01:19.651 --> 00:01:22.681
More rapid than&nbsp;Eagles, his ninja&nbsp;elve&nbsp;climb

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:25.936
Down to&nbsp;the doorway,&nbsp;they ninja inside

00:01:26.385 --> 00:01:28.723
I true in my&nbsp;head and ran down the stairs

00:01:28.823 --> 00:01:32.432
And saw old man Christmas was already&nbsp;there

00:01:32.885 --> 00:01:35.810
Dressed all in silk in long red and&nbsp;white robe

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.706
His hair and white beard were&nbsp;just touching his toes

00:01:38.927 --> 00:01:41.964
He bowed from the waist and then&nbsp;reached up his sleeve

00:01:42.403 --> 00:01:45.096
And took out the list he makes each&nbsp;Christmas Eve

00:01:45.661 --> 00:01:49.041
He gave me a smile and said kids with&nbsp;straight As

00:01:49.376 --> 00:01:52.986
For all their hard work, they'll get&nbsp;presents&nbsp;today&nbsp;

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.124
But make sure they still get a&nbsp;chance to have fun

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.840
They'll&nbsp;get into college when all said and&nbsp;done

00:02:00.291 --> 00:02:03.088
And as he was speaking I looked over to&nbsp;see

00:02:03.305 --> 00:02:05.997
The ninja elves putting gifts under the tree

00:02:06.211 --> 00:02:08.661
With the wink of his eyes and a knot of his head

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.037
He and the ninjas return&nbsp;to their&nbsp;sleigh

00:02:12.484 --> 00:02:15.746
Then I heard him exclaim as&nbsp;he drove out of signs

00:02:16.544 --> 00:02:20.505
Merry Christmas to all and to all a good&nbsp;night.

00:02:22.464 --> 00:02:27.127
M: Hey you guys just a disclaimer, it is not&nbsp;actually&nbsp;a real Chinese legend.

00:02:27.345 --> 00:02:27.705
D: Boomer!

00:02:27.825 --> 00:02:28.291
M: Sorry buddy

00:02:28.855 --> 00:02:29.210
D: Oh well.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.539
M:&nbsp;But that just all fun little&nbsp;adaptation
