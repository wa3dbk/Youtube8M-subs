00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
your team just like Marzia will be so he

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.500 
your team just like Marzia will be so he
has<00:03:19.140> low<00:03:19.440> stamina<00:03:19.860> and<00:03:20.340> his<00:03:20.730> dribbling<00:03:21.240> is

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510

kind<00:03:22.020> of<00:03:22.170> weird<00:03:22.560> sometimes<00:03:23.370> it<00:03:23.670> really<00:03:23.880> feels

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
kind of weird sometimes it really feels

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.710 
kind of weird sometimes it really feels
lanky<00:03:25.470> sometimes<00:03:26.310> and<00:03:26.580> then<00:03:26.790> it<00:03:27.240> feels<00:03:27.450> like

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
lanky sometimes and then it feels like

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.020 
lanky sometimes and then it feels like
he's<00:03:27.930> messy<00:03:28.380> I<00:03:28.560> don't<00:03:28.740> know<00:03:28.890> why<00:03:29.130> but<00:03:29.880> it's

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030

he's messy I don't know why but it's
really<00:03:30.540> weird<00:03:30.840> and<00:03:31.200> I<00:03:31.500> would<00:03:31.680> definitely<00:03:31.950> say

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
really weird and I would definitely say

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.600 
really weird and I would definitely say
that<00:03:32.610> his<00:03:32.970> dribbling<00:03:33.390> is<00:03:33.630> very<00:03:34.020> inconsistent

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
that his dribbling is very inconsistent

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.210 
that his dribbling is very inconsistent
but<00:03:35.610> overall<00:03:36.150> he<00:03:36.750> is<00:03:36.930> a<00:03:36.960> great<00:03:37.380> player<00:03:37.680> to<00:03:37.980> buy

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
but overall he is a great player to buy

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.340 
but overall he is a great player to buy
