00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.040
 Hello today we are going to leave a recipe 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:14.129
 simple and traditional simple it comes to 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.629
 some fresh beans with ham so 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:18.590
 they take note of all the ingredients 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:18.590
 for two 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:27.810
 the ingredients are half a kilo of beans 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.510
 100 grams of sliced â€‹â€‹ham 2 cloves 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.000
 large and a small onion chiquitita 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.990
 besides this we will need salt oil 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.990
 olive and water 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:43.230
 At first we have put oil 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.970
 with the onion and garlic as you can see 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.940
 we have gold and has started to catch 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.920
 color we had about 5 minutes worth 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.670
 this always takes a little bit and we're going to 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.370
 add the commented ham that has been 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.800
 forgotten the ingredients that given is 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.110
 say the amounts are for two 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.260
 people are worth to cast and then 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:07.620
 you the accounts we are going to add the 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.030
 ham let's let it brown 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:13.000
 a little bit 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.310
 and we are going to add the water 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.920
 the supply of crude oil is simply worth it 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.979
 spoke a little 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.340
 but it 's raw and we're going to let 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:26.560
 I steal a tad I have at medium heat 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.659
 and we're going to leave it like 5 minutes like that 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.930
 so that it is impregnated with the 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:30.930
 appetite 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.320
 once we have fried it everything is 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.930
 say the water with the ham 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.060
 onion and garlic it's time to 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:46.150
 know him so just the 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:50.770
 we have like this and we're going to add water 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:53.380
 As you can see, he has simply covered it and 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.150
 I'll leave it five minutes in five 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.880
 Minutitos had to go back to throw him 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.469
 water I comment 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.149
 I mention it because it 's a bit difficult 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:02.619
 find the point is worth then what 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.079
 it's better as I am saying 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:07.630
 you throw a little bit of water to let 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:10.599
 reduce you throw the other little let 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.310
 reduce well and the average time would be 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:16.530
 about 15 minutes depends a little bit then 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.530
 of the baby base or if it is of another kind 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.120
 after 20 minutes cooking such and 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.580
 As I told you, we have added 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.870
 this case three times water we have 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.880
 tested simply when they were 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.650
 we have hoped that the water will 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.900
 consumed so that it stays that way with 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.300
 this texture and we already have lists 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.280
 our beans with ham remember that 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.320
