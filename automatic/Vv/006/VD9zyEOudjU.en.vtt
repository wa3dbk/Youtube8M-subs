simple what is a memory mr. miles

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.819 
simple what is a memory mr. miles
it's<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:49.879> recollection<00:03:50.879> of<00:03:50.969> a<00:03:51.060> past<00:03:51.090> event

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
it's the recollection of a past event

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:53.809 
it's the recollection of a past event

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
then there can be problems so how do we

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.170 
then there can be problems so how do we
fix<00:05:25.480> it<00:05:25.950> we<00:05:26.950> find<00:05:27.250> a<00:05:27.370> memory<00:05:27.670> you<00:05:27.910> can

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
fix it we find a memory you can

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.300 
fix it we find a memory you can
synchronize<00:05:28.810> with<00:05:29.050> and<00:05:29.380> we<00:05:29.890> move<00:05:30.040> forward

from there you'll get used to it this is

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.240 
from there you'll get used to it this is
the<00:05:34.030> closest<00:05:34.480> we<00:05:34.600> can<00:05:34.720> get<00:05:34.920> so<00:05:35.920> it's<00:05:36.100> where

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
the closest we can get so it's where

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.550 
the closest we can get so it's where
we'll<00:05:36.400> have<00:05:36.520> to<00:05:36.580> start<00:05:36.700> I'm<00:05:37.420> uploading<00:05:38.230> the
