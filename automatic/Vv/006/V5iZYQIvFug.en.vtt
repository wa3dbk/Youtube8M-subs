we<00:00:07.340> know<00:00:07.580> that<00:00:07.819> a<00:00:07.850> rod<00:00:08.120> has<00:00:08.450> action<00:00:09.050> and<00:00:09.260> in

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:09.740 
we know that a rod has action and in

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.430 
we know that a rod has action and in
order<00:00:10.100> to<00:00:10.130> trigger<00:00:10.670> that<00:00:10.760> action<00:00:11.450> to<00:00:11.629> work<00:00:12.139> for

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:12.440 
order to trigger that action to work for

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.760 
order to trigger that action to work for
us

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:12.770 
us

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:14.980 
us
we<00:00:12.889> need<00:00:13.100> to<00:00:13.219> start<00:00:13.430> with<00:00:13.639> the<00:00:13.760> grip<00:00:13.940> our<00:00:14.630> hand

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:14.990 
we need to start with the grip our hand

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.950

that is close to you it's not swinging
loosely<00:00:51.260> on<00:00:51.290> the<00:00:51.470> side<00:00:52.300> now<00:00:53.300> in<00:00:53.570> order<00:00:53.750> to<00:00:53.870> cast

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.200 
loosely on the side now in order to cast

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.380 
loosely on the side now in order to cast
well<00:00:54.530> we<00:00:54.860> need<00:00:55.100> to<00:00:55.250> use<00:00:55.400> all<00:00:55.700> three<00:00:55.970> parts<00:00:56.270> of

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
well we need to use all three parts of

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.170 
well we need to use all three parts of
our<00:00:56.510> arm<00:00:56.690> our<00:00:57.410> hand<00:00:57.770> our<00:00:58.100> forearm<00:00:58.730> and<00:00:59.060> our

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
our arm our hand our forearm and our

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.569 
our arm our hand our forearm and our
upper<00:00:59.480> arm<00:00:59.720> let's<00:01:00.560> start<00:01:00.860> with<00:01:01.010> the<00:01:01.160> forearm

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
upper arm let's start with the forearm

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:03.760 
upper arm let's start with the forearm
the<00:01:01.910> forearm<00:01:02.390> gives<00:01:02.690> back-and-forth<00:01:03.440> motion

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:03.770 
the forearm gives back-and-forth motion

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.760 
the forearm gives back-and-forth motion
and<00:01:04.189> it<00:01:04.939> moves<00:01:05.180> back<00:01:05.540> and<00:01:05.750> forth<00:01:05.840> in<00:01:06.290> line<00:01:06.500> with

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
and it moves back and forth in line with

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.320 
and it moves back and forth in line with
the<00:01:06.890> upper<00:01:07.009> arm<00:01:08.020> if<00:01:09.020> we<00:01:09.860> have<00:01:10.009> a<00:01:10.040> short<00:01:10.580> line<00:01:10.940> we

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
the upper arm if we have a short line we

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.870 
the upper arm if we have a short line we
only<00:01:11.600> need<00:01:11.960> a<00:01:11.990> short<00:01:12.409> stroke<00:01:12.740> so<00:01:13.310> we<00:01:13.430> don't<00:01:13.640> use

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
only need a short stroke so we don't use

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.660 
only need a short stroke so we don't use
all<00:01:14.120> the<00:01:14.300> inches<00:01:14.630> if<00:01:14.810> we<00:01:15.530> have<00:01:15.710> a<00:01:15.740> long<00:01:16.010> line<00:01:16.340> we

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
all the inches if we have a long line we

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.490 
all the inches if we have a long line we
would<00:01:16.790> bring<00:01:17.060> this<00:01:17.420> muscle<00:01:17.900> back<00:01:18.140> to<00:01:18.350> this

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
would bring this muscle back to this

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.700 
would bring this muscle back to this
muscle<00:01:19.180> so<00:01:20.180> our<00:01:20.390> stroke<00:01:20.720> length<00:01:21.020> is<00:01:21.229> variable

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
muscle so our stroke length is variable

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.800 
muscle so our stroke length is variable
and<00:01:22.130> it's<00:01:22.340> done<00:01:22.549> with<00:01:22.580> that<00:01:22.880> forearm<00:01:23.150> moving

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
and it's done with that forearm moving

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.469 
and it's done with that forearm moving
back<00:01:24.020> and<00:01:24.229> forth<00:01:24.500> now<00:01:25.280> within<00:01:25.549> that<00:01:25.700> motion<00:01:26.090> we

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
back and forth now within that motion we

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.020 
back and forth now within that motion we
need<00:01:26.510> to<00:01:26.810> use<00:01:26.990> our<00:01:27.170> wrist<00:01:27.470> and<00:01:27.830> the<00:01:28.790> first

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
need to use our wrist and the first

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.300 
need to use our wrist and the first
position<00:01:29.510> is<00:01:29.659> a<00:01:29.690> bent<00:01:30.020> down<00:01:30.350> wrist<00:01:30.740> so<00:01:31.130> that

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
position is a bent down wrist so that

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.219 
position is a bent down wrist so that
your<00:01:31.490> hand<00:01:31.790> is<00:01:31.940> down<00:01:32.240> as<00:01:32.479> far<00:01:32.720> as<00:01:32.750> it<00:01:32.990> can<00:01:33.170> go

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
your hand is down as far as it can go

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.859 
your hand is down as far as it can go
and<00:01:33.560> the<00:01:34.100> second<00:01:34.490> position<00:01:34.909> is<00:01:35.390> a<00:01:35.450> straight

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
and the second position is a straight

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.440 
and the second position is a straight
wrist<00:01:36.140> and<00:01:37.070> the<00:01:37.250> easiest<00:01:37.549> way<00:01:37.909> to<00:01:37.970> relate<00:01:38.390> to

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
wrist and the easiest way to relate to

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.109 
wrist and the easiest way to relate to
that<00:01:38.630> is<00:01:39.020> to<00:01:39.470> put<00:01:39.650> a<00:01:39.680> rod<00:01:39.920> in<00:01:40.130> your<00:01:40.159> hand<00:01:40.580> in<00:01:40.970> a

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
it's very easy to see you can look right

else that tells you that it's right if

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.609 
else that tells you that it's right if
you<00:02:01.909> bend<00:02:02.150> your<00:02:02.330> wrist<00:02:02.540> backward<00:02:03.140> like<00:02:03.320> this

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
you bend your wrist backward like this

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.910 
you bend your wrist backward like this
which<00:02:04.159> I<00:02:04.280> call<00:02:04.549> wristing<00:02:05.240> it's<00:02:05.420> a<00:02:05.509> new<00:02:05.659> verb

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920

then<00:02:06.920> it<00:02:07.100> takes<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:07.520> rod<00:02:07.700> shaft<00:02:08.119> very<00:02:08.780> low<00:02:09.019> and

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
then it takes the rod shaft very low and

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.080 
then it takes the rod shaft very low and
back<00:02:09.349> and<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:09.979> tip<00:02:10.220> throws<00:02:10.489> the<00:02:10.670> line<00:02:10.849> down

into the water and you certainly don't
want<00:02:12.620> that<00:02:12.830> so<00:02:13.819> 45<00:02:14.749> degrees<00:02:15.200> straight<00:02:15.469> wrist

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:15.859 
want that so 45 degrees straight wrist

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:19.300 
want that so 45 degrees straight wrist
is<00:02:16.069> the<00:02:16.279> max<00:02:16.519> and<00:02:17.499> every<00:02:18.499> cast<00:02:18.769> will<00:02:19.040> start

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
is the max and every cast will start

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.050 
is the max and every cast will start

learned<00:02:27.920> to<00:02:28.010> cast<00:02:28.250> in<00:02:28.459> the<00:02:28.580> 30s<00:02:29.000> that's<00:02:29.480> all<00:02:29.780> we

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
learned to cast in the 30s that's all we

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.809 
learned to cast in the 30s that's all we
used<00:02:30.260> and<00:02:30.860> they<00:02:30.950> would<00:02:31.100> put<00:02:31.280> a<00:02:31.310> book<00:02:31.550> or<00:02:31.760> a

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
used and they would put a book or a

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.030 
used and they would put a book or a
dollar<00:02:32.060> bill<00:02:32.360> under<00:02:32.750> your<00:02:32.900> arm<00:02:33.110> dollar<00:02:33.770> bill

dollar bill under your arm dollar bill

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.220 
dollar bill under your arm dollar bill
for<00:02:34.190> kids<00:02:34.430> because<00:02:34.610> it<00:02:34.880> was<00:02:35.000> more<00:02:35.180> valuable

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
for kids because it was more valuable

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.020 
for kids because it was more valuable
and<00:02:36.230> I<00:02:36.440> imagine<00:02:36.890> today<00:02:37.190> they'd<00:02:37.580> probably<00:02:37.730> put

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
and I imagine today they'd probably put

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.050 
and I imagine today they'd probably put
a<00:02:38.060> Rolex<00:02:38.540> but<00:02:39.530> anyway<00:02:39.950> we<00:02:40.370> could<00:02:40.489> only<00:02:40.670> cast

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
a Rolex but anyway we could only cast

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.500 
a Rolex but anyway we could only cast
this<00:02:41.420> way<00:02:41.630> just<00:02:41.989> for<00:02:42.350> arm<00:02:42.650> and<00:02:43.040> hand<00:02:43.370> well<00:02:44.180> that

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
this way just for arm and hand well that

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.240 
this way just for arm and hand well that
didn't<00:02:44.840> work<00:02:44.959> for<00:02:44.989> me<00:02:45.350> very<00:02:45.590> long<00:02:45.830> and<00:02:46.069> so<00:02:46.220> I

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
didn't work for me very long and so I

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.140 
didn't work for me very long and so I
threw<00:02:46.790> away<00:02:46.819> that<00:02:47.600> valuable<00:02:48.080> item<00:02:48.500> and<00:02:49.150> lifted

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
threw away that valuable item and lifted

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.729 
threw away that valuable item and lifted
my<00:02:50.300> elbow<00:02:50.660> and<00:02:50.840> found<00:02:51.080> that<00:02:51.260> I<00:02:51.290> could<00:02:51.500> cast

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
my elbow and found that I could cast

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.520 
my elbow and found that I could cast
much<00:02:52.100> more<00:02:52.370> easily<00:02:52.790> and<00:02:53.090> so<00:02:53.900> that<00:02:54.140> upper<00:02:54.500> arm

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
much more easily and so that upper arm

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.130 
much more easily and so that upper arm
is<00:02:55.040> part<00:02:55.340> of<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.580> casting<00:02:56.060> stroke<00:02:56.420> and<00:02:56.660> what

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
is part of the casting stroke and what

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.130 
is part of the casting stroke and what
it<00:02:57.260> does<00:02:57.500> is<00:02:57.709> lift<00:02:58.010> and<00:02:58.340> lower<00:02:58.880> so<00:02:59.510> your<00:02:59.720> elbow

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
it does is lift and lower so your elbow

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.890 
it does is lift and lower so your elbow
goes<00:03:00.410> up<00:03:00.709> and<00:03:00.980> down<00:03:01.040> as<00:03:01.459> your<00:03:02.209> forearm<00:03:02.690> is

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
goes up and down as your forearm is

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.680 
goes up and down as your forearm is
going<00:03:03.230> back<00:03:03.440> and<00:03:03.650> forth<00:03:03.920> the<00:03:04.610> elbow<00:03:05.090> lifts<00:03:05.540> and

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
going back and forth the elbow lifts and

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.190 
going back and forth the elbow lifts and
lowers<00:03:05.870> and<00:03:07.420> there's<00:03:08.420> no<00:03:08.630> tension<00:03:08.870> in<00:03:09.170> your

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
lowers and there's no tension in your

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.850 
lowers and there's no tension in your
upper<00:03:09.319> arm<00:03:09.769> so<00:03:10.459> fly<00:03:10.760> casting<00:03:11.330> then<00:03:11.569> is<00:03:11.989> the

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
upper arm so fly casting then is the

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.190 
upper arm so fly casting then is the
back<00:03:13.069> and<00:03:13.100> forth<00:03:13.580> motion<00:03:14.150> of<00:03:14.330> the<00:03:14.569> forearm<00:03:15.019> and

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
back and forth motion of the forearm and

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.130 
back and forth motion of the forearm and
hand<00:03:15.489> within<00:03:16.489> the<00:03:17.030> up<00:03:17.180> and<00:03:17.390> down<00:03:17.540> motion<00:03:17.780> of

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
hand within the up and down motion of

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.800 
hand within the up and down motion of
the<00:03:18.350> whole<00:03:18.560> arm<00:03:18.950> and<00:03:19.250> it's<00:03:19.910> a<00:03:20.000> bit<00:03:20.209> like<00:03:20.360> a<00:03:20.390> chop

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
the whole arm and it's a bit like a chop

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.650 
the whole arm and it's a bit like a chop
and<00:03:21.170> we<00:03:22.130> end<00:03:22.340> up<00:03:22.459> being<00:03:22.760> able<00:03:22.880> to<00:03:23.030> push<00:03:23.420> with

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
and we end up being able to push with

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.759 
and we end up being able to push with
that<00:03:23.840> thumb<00:03:24.310> so<00:03:25.310> you<00:03:25.370> might<00:03:25.640> practice<00:03:26.180> this

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
that thumb so you might practice this

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:30.759 
that thumb so you might practice this
practice<00:03:27.769> it<00:03:27.920> with<00:03:28.070> your<00:03:28.280> bare<00:03:28.519> hand<00:03:28.989> or<00:03:29.989> if

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
practice it with your bare hand or if

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.680 
practice it with your bare hand or if
you're<00:03:31.010> at<00:03:31.190> your<00:03:31.430> desk<00:03:31.459> and<00:03:32.030> no<00:03:32.480> one's

you're at your desk and no one's
watching<00:03:32.930> you<00:03:33.230> could<00:03:33.620> do<00:03:34.040> a<00:03:34.070> pen<00:03:34.400> where<00:03:34.610> use<00:03:34.760> a

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
watching you could do a pen where use a

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.680 
watching you could do a pen where use a
pen<00:03:36.160> because<00:03:37.160> it's<00:03:37.489> all<00:03:37.760> in<00:03:38.060> the<00:03:38.209> motion<00:03:38.570> of

rod butt and reel and now let me show
you<00:03:46.970> how<00:03:47.329> it<00:03:47.450> works<00:03:47.600> with<00:03:47.900> a<00:03:47.930> rod<00:03:48.230> and<00:03:48.260> line

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.290 

as<00:03:55.300> I've<00:03:55.599> said<00:03:56.760> broadcasting<00:03:57.760> is<00:03:57.910> the<00:03:58.090> back

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
as I've said broadcasting is the back

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.720 
as I've said broadcasting is the back
and<00:03:58.540> forth<00:03:58.780> motion<00:03:59.080> of<00:03:59.500> the<00:03:59.739> forearm<00:04:00.250> and<00:04:00.459> hand

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
and forth motion of the forearm and hand

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.089 
and forth motion of the forearm and hand
within<00:04:01.150> the<00:04:01.510> up<00:04:01.660> and<00:04:01.900> down<00:04:02.050> motion<00:04:02.349> of<00:04:02.739> the

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 
within the up and down motion of the

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:06.449 
within the up and down motion of the
whole<00:04:03.310> arm<00:04:03.760> the<00:04:04.750> wrist<00:04:05.050> moves<00:04:05.500> from<00:04:05.890> bent<00:04:06.190> down

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
whole arm the wrist moves from bent down

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.809 
whole arm the wrist moves from bent down
to<00:04:07.000> straight<00:04:07.410> the<00:04:08.410> forearm<00:04:08.980> comes<00:04:09.280> back<00:04:09.580> in

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
to straight the forearm comes back in

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:15.330 
to straight the forearm comes back in
line<00:04:10.060> with<00:04:10.390> the<00:04:10.510> upper<00:04:10.780> arm<00:04:10.959> and<00:04:13.890> the<00:04:14.890> elbow

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
line with the upper arm and the elbow

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.969 
line with the upper arm and the elbow
lifts<00:04:15.790> and<00:04:16.000> lowers<00:04:16.180> to<00:04:16.989> engage<00:04:17.350> that<00:04:17.380> upper

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
lifts and lowers to engage that upper

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.810 
lifts and lowers to engage that upper
arm<00:04:18.010> action<00:04:19.079> it's<00:04:20.079> an<00:04:20.260> overall<00:04:20.820> acceleration

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
arm action it's an overall acceleration

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:27.180 
arm action it's an overall acceleration
to<00:04:22.240> a<00:04:22.270> stop<00:04:25.229> these<00:04:26.229> are<00:04:26.500> the<00:04:26.620> basic<00:04:27.070> elements

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
to a stop these are the basic elements

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.510 
to a stop these are the basic elements
of<00:04:27.610> good<00:04:27.970> casting
