00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.460
 already today I will try pardo pasta 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.910
 I purchased this dough 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:16.090
 pardo of the jewelery line play that 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:18.820
 europa the lilac number 504 is a loaf 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.520
 from 56 grams and that must be cooked 120 degrees 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.199
 for 30 minutes and is closed in this 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.600
 plastic pack who does not leave 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:27.250
 drying the pasta is also present 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.310
 small amount of beeswax e 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.439
 inside there are instructions 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.050
 shamefully translated into Italian it is 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.850
 exactly the same thing compared to 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.469
 pasta that play because it was 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.289
 simply changed the name and in 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:42.940
 Italy is marketed instead of you 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:44.890
 from the living decor then also the 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.019
 instructions are the same for and in 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.449
 this case are all the better 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:51.309
 presents soft without being not tip 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.260
 crumbles it leaves no trace on 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.629
 hands except in the case of luminescence 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.679
 as in this case not being the 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.199
 opaque color 

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:01.600
 the only thing is that it tends to be e 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:04.720
 soft but don't think you do n't feel 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.030
 never even once lost softness even 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.920
 continuing not to crumble it is mine 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.250
 opinion more difficult to recondition 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.050
 compared to pasta tivo I made mine 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.150
 usual experiment to test 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.800
 elasticity so I pulled the dough 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.410
 in the machine with the most thickness 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.920
 thin of the rollers and I did it also for 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.240
 the atrium that is after cooking are 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.830
 absolutely elastic and with rails 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.830
 rather called TV 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.860
 well that's all i hope this 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.420
 video was helpful 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.640
