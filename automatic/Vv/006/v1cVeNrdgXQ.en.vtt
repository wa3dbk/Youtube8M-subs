00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.300
 hello how about how are you 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.420
 I greet you with affection and an affectionate 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.580
 greeting wishing that the problems that 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.430
 may have in the marriage it 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:21.730
 become small trampolines for 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:25.419
 improve the relationship or I want to say these 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:28.390
 words for men or not rather 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:32.619
 focused on men let's talk 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:34.570
 a bit about how to treat a man 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.809
 men by nature we are very 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:41.649
 little expressive and the only moment that 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:44.500
 if we do 100% of expressing ourselves is 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:49.060
 when you walk in the courtship of the 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:53.050
 couple you know better than anyone 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:56.980
 but once this goal is achieved 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.370
 this ends totally or low by the 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.309
 floors 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:05.479
 something that happens with men is that 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:08.900
 they have many moments of nothing for 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:13.390
 example, you ask what happens to me 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:17.820
 love and he will surely answer all 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:20.250
 while you stay like nothing 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.979
 your mind is going through endless 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.440
 events that may be happening 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:29.520
 while in the mind of man you 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.770
 What do you think? Nothing happens and that's how it is. 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.530
 nature of most of all 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.960
 Men really is not happening 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:42.000
 nothing then all you have left is 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.630
 understand that in reality men to 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.860
 sometimes we do not think about anything while 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.890
 you have endless thoughts 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.370
 but as I mentioned, it's part of the 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.980
 nature of man as well as you as 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:02.070
 you have a maze of things that 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:04.620
 say the man on the contrary the 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.530
 mind you work in small schemes 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.479
 of thought that separate one from the 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.480
 other 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:16.620
 what is the path to follow especially 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.840
 If your partner does not listen to you very much, stop 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.500
 most important to talk to him 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:26.459
 and if you think you need to talk a lot 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:30.269
 more is simple look for your comadre to your 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:33.989
 Friend your cousin and practice everything 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:36.510
 that you want but a lot of eye does not solve 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.590
 the problems of the couple there the 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.269
 problems solve those with your husband ok 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.209
 thank you very much this was vicente 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:49.280
 solÃ­s for ideal marriage and remember 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.280
 that love always triumphs
