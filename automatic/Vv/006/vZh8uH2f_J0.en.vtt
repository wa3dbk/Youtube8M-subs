galaxy<00:01:29.530> Pegasus<00:01:29.950> D<00:01:30.100> exit

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
galaxy Pegasus D exit

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.200 
galaxy Pegasus D exit
and<00:01:31.320> that'll<00:01:32.320> be<00:01:32.440> interesting<00:01:33.310> you<00:01:34.090> know

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
maybe redo some of the battles that I've

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.359 
maybe redo some of the battles that I've
done<00:01:36.160> in<00:01:36.310> this<00:01:36.430> stadium<00:01:36.910> the<00:01:37.090> BB<00:01:38.050> 10<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:41.369> the

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
done in this stadium the BB 10 and the

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.090 
done in this stadium the BB 10 and the
salt<00:01:42.580> Herodians<00:01:43.090> losing<00:01:43.780> power<00:01:44.100> slowly

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
salt Herodians losing power slowly

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:56.010 
salt Herodians losing power slowly
slowly<00:01:45.610> slowly<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:51.869> down<00:01:52.869> you<00:01:53.080> go<00:01:54.690> alright<00:01:55.690> so

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
slowly slowly and down you go alright so

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:07.639 
slowly slowly and down you go alright so
earth<00:01:56.710> eagle<00:01:57.160> takes<00:01:57.580> the<00:01:57.729> win<00:01:57.880> for<00:01:58.090> round<00:01:58.270> one

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.220 

and<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.940> rabbit<00:02:10.149> launcher<00:02:10.600> definitely<00:02:11.020> gives

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
and the rabbit launcher definitely gives

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.690 
and the rabbit launcher definitely gives
a<00:02:11.320> lot<00:02:11.470> more<00:02:11.650> power<00:02:11.860> that's<00:02:12.070> why<00:02:12.190> you<00:02:12.340> see<00:02:12.550> the

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
a lot more power that's why you see the

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.140 
a lot more power that's why you see the
silver<00:02:13.030> rhodium<00:02:13.180> circling<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:14.049> stadium<00:02:14.530> a

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
silver rhodium circling the stadium a

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.610 
silver rhodium circling the stadium a
little<00:02:16.150> more<00:02:16.330> than<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:16.630> usually<00:02:16.930> would<00:02:17.049> with

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
little more than it usually would with

00:02:17.620 --> 00:03:00.309 
little more than it usually would with
my<00:02:17.650> crappy<00:02:18.220> LR<00:02:19.120> string<00:02:19.480> launcher<00:02:19.870> strength

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.960 

now<00:03:01.319> it<00:03:01.470> looks<00:03:01.680> like<00:03:01.830> earth<00:03:02.160> Eagles<00:03:02.580> losing

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
now it looks like earth Eagles losing

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.250 
now it looks like earth Eagles losing
energy<00:03:04.970> sorry<00:03:05.970> if<00:03:06.150> this<00:03:06.330> battle<00:03:06.810> might<00:03:06.989> take<00:03:07.230> a

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
energy sorry if this battle might take a

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.860 
energy sorry if this battle might take a
while<00:03:07.500> cuz<00:03:08.330> they<00:03:09.330> have<00:03:09.450> good<00:03:09.599> stamina

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
while cuz they have good stamina

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:16.420 
while cuz they have good stamina
especially<00:03:10.620> with<00:03:10.739> the<00:03:10.860> rope<00:03:11.010> launcher

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.009 

probably<00:03:17.430> a<00:03:17.489> decently<00:03:18.360> long<00:03:18.890> battle<00:03:19.890> video

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
probably a decently long battle video

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.589 
probably a decently long battle video
so<00:03:22.019> looks<00:03:22.349> like<00:03:22.670> assault<00:03:23.670> rhodium<00:03:24.239> takes<00:03:24.450> the

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
so looks like assault rhodium takes the

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:26.300 
so looks like assault rhodium takes the
win<00:03:24.690> for<00:03:24.870> Iran<00:03:25.019> -<00:03:25.260> and<00:03:25.440> now<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.590> score<00:03:25.950> is<00:03:26.040> one

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
win for Iran - and now the score is one

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:54.080 
win for Iran - and now the score is one
to<00:03:26.340> one<00:03:39.349> unfortunately<00:03:40.349> not<00:03:40.530> all<00:03:52.700> right<00:03:53.700> and

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
to one unfortunately not all right and

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.879 
to one unfortunately not all right and
it<00:03:54.390> looks<00:03:54.540> like<00:03:54.630> earth<00:03:55.019> eagle<00:03:55.349> was<00:03:55.650> knocked

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
it looks like earth eagle was knocked

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:58.069 
it looks like earth eagle was knocked
out<00:03:56.130> of<00:03:56.250> the<00:03:56.340> stadium<00:03:56.579> and<00:03:56.910> thus<00:03:57.389> all<00:03:57.540> Herodium

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
out of the stadium and thus all Herodium

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.539 
out of the stadium and thus all Herodium
takes<00:03:58.350> to<00:03:58.500> win<00:03:58.650> four<00:03:58.829> on<00:03:58.950> three<00:03:59.130> so<00:03:59.370> now<00:03:59.489> the

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
takes to win four on three so now the

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.580 
takes to win four on three so now the
score<00:03:59.850> is<00:03:59.880> two<00:04:00.180> to<00:04:00.209> one<00:04:00.480> in<00:04:00.510> favor<00:04:00.959> of<00:04:01.170> basalt

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
score is two to one in favor of basalt

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:21.160 
score is two to one in favor of basalt
Herodium

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.170 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.470
