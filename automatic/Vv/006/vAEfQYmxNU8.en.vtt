00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.090
 hello how is your friend the veterinarian rubÃ©n borja 

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.860
 I want started with you a series of videos 

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:11.789
 about ecology the girl 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:14.529
 and later also maybe we'll talk 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:15.529
 percent 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:18.640
 of some other species in relation 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.560
 where you have these pet photos with the cars but in this case we're going 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.970
 start talking I suffered a little about 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.289
 the communication of the works 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.699
 to talk about the communication of the sections we have to 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:33.010
 remember a little 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.290
 the social organization of these 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.170
 since 1993 it has been proven that the genome of the dog is 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.890
 identical to wolf 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.900
 with this it was finished 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.500
 with those stories that the dog was a descendant of the wolves 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.660
 scientifically it is already proven some people some for sure 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.950
 professionals 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.150
 they are still talking about the dog and the wolf being different species 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.190
 read would indicate to them that they will study a little revise to be rather 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.290
 about this theme 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.910
 it is proven that the genome 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.550
 of the wolf prd are identical then we are talking about they are wolves 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.150
 or a race of loins 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.420
 the charros that we have our house we will be talking about human wolves 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.710
 this communication that occurs between 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.050
 dogs and humans in this case and with other species 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.400
 is part of what would be the social organization 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.400
 the for the communication of the dogs within a herd 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.980
 Communication occurs when an individual from this group united, emits a signal 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.650
 what should not be able to modify the behavior of another individual 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.660
 despite the receiver 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.360
 and that is part of this same herd 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.390
 it is so when we educators paths 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.140
 he tried 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.860
 teach a dog 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.970
 or educate a dog for some that have a behavior 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.480
 we must 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.060
 make it clear 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.189
 in the dog owner that communication 

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:10.149
 between 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.199
 which is the sender and the receiver 

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:15.039
 it must always be the same 

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:18.039
 this communication has three main components 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:23.099
 I will mention them quickly because this is not a course, it is an entrance to 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.909
 that we go giving one 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.019
 simple and of it 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.829
 paris visualizing what we want to do 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:32.969
 in a training or specialization 

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:36.259
 working canning 

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:39.659
 the 3 per 100 main components 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.159
 self-esteem communication 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:44.289
 visual communication 

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:47.289
 and the commission the olfactory communication 

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:50.429
 auditory communication 

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:53.729
 logically through vocalizations 

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:56.009
 or emission of sounds 

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:59.029
 this communication can be useful in nearby 

00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:01.949
 roses monge we are very close to the dog 

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:04.969
 and it is not possible to do it during the absence 

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:08.749
 it is foolish presence of the issuer 

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:12.489
 and it does not persist in the environment either, it is an auditory communication 

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:17.289
 then the summit comes visual communication 

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:19.350
 which is through him our sport ' 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.209
 body postures 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.159
 the body postures of the dog 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:28.779
 our facial gestures or in the case of the dog the position of the tail and the 

00:03:28.779 --> 00:03:30.179
 ears 

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:31.830
 that visual communication 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.599
 can be use nearby town 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.979
 as yet a medium range of separation 

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:44.099
 that is why the presence of emissaries of the sector is needed 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.849
 so you can see this quick communication between you the interaction 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:49.859
 between individuals 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.189
 augmentative communication 

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:55.199
 this afternoon from urine 

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:56.499
 that's 

00:03:56.499 --> 00:03:58.679
 the glandular secretions 

00:03:58.679 --> 00:04:00.389
 what are pheromones 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:01.879
 and all 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:05.249
 all other scent that are in the vicinity of the near 

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:08.669
 also this communication is useful in nearby 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:10.199
 and for the dog 

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:13.059
 listen also in the distant 

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:17.840
 and may even continue to miss you can continue processing even with your dog 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:21.479
 in absence 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:24.059
 and in the absence of the same issuer 

00:04:24.059 --> 00:04:26.569
 cel of these emitter receivers 

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:28.249
 and they last a long time 

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:30.499
 that's how the wolves 

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:32.449
 What are they 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:35.449
 yago school wild 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:37.180
 the opinion 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.330
 many of the confrontations 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.699
 and problems they may have with other individuals of the same human species 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:45.370
 this is 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.300
 through auditory communication 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.120
 visual communication 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.719
 and olfactory communication 

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:54.409
 it is like 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:55.819
 2 wolves 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:05:00.539
 in this case our other urban looks establish social hierarchies 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:03.159
 in that way they are avoided 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:04.669
 the disputes 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:06.490
 because they can be solved 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.490
 easily and clearly through signals 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.510
 this does not require then days 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.270
 ddd fights and fight 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.479
 canine communication 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:20.990
 it is thus equal to that of the wolves 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.850
 It is mainly based olfactory signals and vowels signals 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:26.439
 tactile and signals 

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:27.779
 visuals 

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:29.529
 so 

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:32.789
 per cent we sometimes expect the owners partners of a dog 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.360
 the dog feels calm when he goes for a walk with us 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.379
 if we are going to take a walk and we are nervous 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.540
 the dog been Portuguese 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.470
 creating our nervousness and therefore to be 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.319
 part of the herd 

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:52.889
 he is also demanding because he does not know why we are nervous but intuits 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:54.099
 that something 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:58.399
 stressful something that could be even dangerous is going to happen 

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:03.569
 that's why to the people who are within the pop groups of 

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:06.279
 Case and canine training work 

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:09.589
 we always tell them to take the training 

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:10.909
 Like a game 

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:15.020
 and that they maintain that training is education within their homes 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.930
 he seems to me in people many times he does not understand 

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:22.919
 if it is not necessary to take it to the park 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:26.050
 to teach him the quiet 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.669
 we can not do when we are reading the newspaper watching the 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:31.509
 television and the theater is going to take off 

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:33.440
 born in the simple 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.689
 of communication the visual 

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:40.009
 body posture to the state animal showing what we want us to 

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:41.740
 approach 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.310
 when we are inside the house with soft voice 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:48.259
 because we do not speak to him vocalizes will show that he comes saying his name 

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:51.069
 auditory communication 

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:54.569
 and also with a taste we are calm and we feel happy 

00:06:55.599 --> 00:07:00.169
 because we do not approach the dog so we fly olfactory communication 

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:04.160
 and realize that we are very very good mood we feel very 

00:07:04.159 --> 00:07:05.819
 calm and safe 

00:07:05.819 --> 00:07:08.819
 and in that moment we went for a walk with him 

00:07:09.849 --> 00:07:13.669
 So far we leave this first entry where we talked about communication 

00:07:13.669 --> 00:07:14.899
 canine 

00:07:14.899 --> 00:07:19.029
 and the various types I must main components of that communication 

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:21.630
 in the next entry 

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:26.060
 I hope now either more often I feel fresh apologies for not having 

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:29.110
 has nothing on the blog 

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:32.729
 the tcnel the canine training work it took me 

00:07:32.729 --> 00:07:36.650
 of the other courses in these last weeks 

00:07:37.619 --> 00:07:40.709
 but here is the question and who and in the next post we are going to talk 

00:07:40.709 --> 00:07:44.209
 explicitly already of those signals the olfactory signals 

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:46.310
 what the postures 

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:47.899
 percent and bodily 

00:07:47.899 --> 00:07:50.659
 and of the united cheers or vocalizations 

00:07:50.659 --> 00:07:54.979
 I send you a hug are your friend the veterinarian rubÃ©n borja 

00:07:54.979 --> 00:07:56.610
 and see you in the next 

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:57.159
 Thank you
