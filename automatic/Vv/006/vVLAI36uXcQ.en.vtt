let's get started we're going to start

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.750 
let's get started we're going to start
out<00:00:28.199> by<00:00:28.349> making<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.830> tart<00:00:29.130> shells<00:00:29.400> for<00:00:29.640> our

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
out by making the tart shells for our

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.939 
out by making the tart shells for our
Totoro<00:00:30.119> tarts<00:00:30.480> so<00:00:30.990> today<00:00:31.260> I<00:00:31.289> am<00:00:31.439> just<00:00:31.650> using

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
Totoro tarts so today I am just using

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.190 
Totoro tarts so today I am just using
some<00:00:32.099> refrigerated<00:00:32.759> pie<00:00:32.940> crusts<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.480> know<00:00:33.809> it's

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
some refrigerated pie crusts I know it's

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.229 
some refrigerated pie crusts I know it's
not<00:00:34.590> from<00:00:34.860> scratch<00:00:35.190> but<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.700> think<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.090> it's

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
not from scratch but I think that it's

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.910 
not from scratch but I think that it's
pretty<00:00:36.510> good<00:00:36.750> still<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.649> makes<00:00:37.829> this

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
pretty good still and it makes this

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.459 
pretty good still and it makes this
recipe<00:00:38.070> way<00:00:38.640> easier<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:39.960> just<00:00:40.110> rolled<00:00:40.320> it

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
recipe way easier so I just rolled it

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.950 
recipe way easier so I just rolled it
out<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.590> little<00:00:41.010> bit<00:00:41.129> thinner<00:00:41.629> then<00:00:42.629> I'm<00:00:42.719> going

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
out a little bit thinner then I'm going

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.540 
out a little bit thinner then I'm going
to<00:00:43.020> grab<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.320> bowl<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:43.920> slightly<00:00:44.250> bigger

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
to grab a bowl that is slightly bigger

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.369 
to grab a bowl that is slightly bigger
than<00:00:44.850> my<00:00:45.000> tart<00:00:45.300> tin<00:00:45.480> I'm<00:00:45.660> going<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.170> place<00:00:46.350> it

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
than my tart tin I'm going to place it

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.200 
than my tart tin I'm going to place it
onto<00:00:46.710> my<00:00:46.980> crust<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.520> then<00:00:47.700> use<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.879> knife<00:00:48.180> to

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
onto my crust and then use a knife to

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.930 
onto my crust and then use a knife to
cut<00:00:48.390> around<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.809> outside<00:00:49.610> you<00:00:50.610> want<00:00:50.730> that

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
cut around the outside you want that

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.850 
cut around the outside you want that
extra<00:00:51.120> overhang<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:51.930> crust<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.469> can<00:00:52.649> mold

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
extra overhang of crust so you can mold

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.439 
extra overhang of crust so you can mold
it<00:00:53.010> up<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.160> size<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:53.550> your<00:00:53.640> tin<00:00:53.850> so<00:00:54.329> if<00:00:54.390> you

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
it up the size of your tin so if you

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:55.850 
it up the size of your tin so if you
have<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.570> really<00:00:54.840> deep<00:00:55.079> tart<00:00:55.410> tin<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.710> want

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.830 
have a really deep tart tin you want
more<00:00:56.100> overhang<00:00:56.610> give<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.090> shallow<00:00:57.390> one<00:00:57.629> you

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
more overhang give a shallow one you

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.549 
more overhang give a shallow one you
want<00:00:57.989> less<00:00:59.480> then<00:01:00.480> I'm<00:01:00.629> just<00:01:00.840> using<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.230> side

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
want less then I'm just using the side

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.349 
want less then I'm just using the side
of<00:01:01.829> my<00:01:01.949> thumb<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.430> press<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.879> crust<00:01:03.149> into

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
of my thumb to press the crust into

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.039 
of my thumb to press the crust into
every<00:01:03.809> little<00:01:03.989> scallop<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.739> tin<00:01:06.049> after

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
every little scallop of the tin after

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.600 
every little scallop of the tin after
that<00:01:07.229> I'm<00:01:07.439> just<00:01:07.650> going<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.950> remove<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.430> excess

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.750 
that I'm just going to remove the excess
crust<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.619> then<00:01:10.619> I'm<00:01:10.770> going<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.070> use<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.430> fork

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
crust and then I'm going to use a fork

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.399 
crust and then I'm going to use a fork
to<00:01:11.939> prick<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.180> bottom<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.750> crust<00:01:12.990> this

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
to prick the bottom of the crust this

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.260 
to prick the bottom of the crust this
way<00:01:13.590> as<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:13.979> bakes<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.400> won't<00:01:14.580> get<00:01:14.729> any<00:01:14.880> huge

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
way as it bakes you won't get any huge

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.050 
way as it bakes you won't get any huge
air<00:01:15.479> bubbles<00:01:16.159> then<00:01:17.159> I'm<00:01:17.310> going<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.640> bake<00:01:17.880> this

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
air bubbles then I'm going to bake this

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.850 
air bubbles then I'm going to bake this
off<00:01:18.240> at<00:01:18.450> 425<00:01:19.259> for<00:01:19.290> about<00:01:19.740> 12<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.100> 13<00:01:20.549> minutes

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.620 
off at 425 for about 12 to 13 minutes
now<00:01:22.860> we<00:01:22.920> can<00:01:23.220> make<00:01:23.369> our<00:01:23.549> black<00:01:23.820> sesame<00:01:24.060> pudding

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630

specialty grocery store to find these
but<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.040> imagine<00:01:29.490> something<00:01:29.700> like<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:30.060> whole

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
but I imagine something like a whole

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.510 
but I imagine something like a whole
foods<00:01:30.600> would<00:01:30.750> have<00:01:30.930> them<00:01:31.110> so<00:01:32.070> he'll<00:01:32.220> just<00:01:32.280> need

foods would have them so he'll just need

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.450
