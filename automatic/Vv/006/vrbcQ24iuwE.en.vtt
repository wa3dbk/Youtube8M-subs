let's take a moment and discuss
you<00:00:12.130> find<00:00:12.520> a<00:00:13.000> medical<00:00:13.540> oncologist<00:00:14.130> that<00:00:15.130> is

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:15.310 
you find a medical oncologist that is

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.830 
you find a medical oncologist that is
familiar<00:00:16.000> with<00:00:16.030> the<00:00:17.190> indications

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.100 
applications in use of the Oncotype DX
test<00:00:22.950> now<00:00:23.950> remember<00:00:24.310> Oncotype<00:00:25.240> DX<00:00:25.270> has<00:00:25.900> now

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.110 
test now remember Oncotype DX has now

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.180 
test now remember Oncotype DX has now
three<00:00:26.500> indications<00:00:28.020> premenopausal<00:00:29.190> patients

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:30.190 
three indications premenopausal patients

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.119 
three indications premenopausal patients
who<00:00:30.400> are<00:00:30.430> estrogen<00:00:31.000> receptor<00:00:31.810> positive<00:00:32.129> lymph

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:33.129 
who are estrogen receptor positive lymph

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:37.530 
who are estrogen receptor positive lymph
node-negative<00:00:34.470> postmenopausal<00:00:35.550> women<00:00:36.550> who

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:37.540 
node-negative postmenopausal women who

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.640 
node-negative postmenopausal women who
are<00:00:37.989> also<00:00:38.580> estrogen<00:00:39.580> receptor<00:00:40.150> positive<00:00:40.650> but

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650 
are also estrogen receptor positive but

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.219 
are also estrogen receptor positive but
may<00:00:41.890> have<00:00:42.160> up<00:00:42.340> to<00:00:42.489> one<00:00:42.850> between<00:00:43.780> one<00:00:43.989> and<00:00:44.019> three

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:44.229 
may have up to one between one and three

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:47.130 
may have up to one between one and three
lymph<00:00:45.070> nodes<00:00:45.309> that<00:00:45.519> are<00:00:45.580> positive<00:00:46.210> and<00:00:46.330> now

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
lymph nodes that are positive and now

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.299 
lymph nodes that are positive and now
also<00:00:47.500> in<00:00:48.190> insight<00:00:48.790> to<00:00:49.030> breast<00:00:49.360> cancer<00:00:50.100> this<00:00:51.100> is

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 
also in insight to breast cancer this is

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:53.100 
also in insight to breast cancer this is
a<00:00:51.339> really<00:00:51.790> important<00:00:52.239> assay<00:00:52.600> that<00:00:52.629> can<00:00:52.989> be

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
a really important assay that can be

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.469 
a really important assay that can be
used<00:00:53.290> in<00:00:53.589> these<00:00:53.739> different<00:00:54.220> settings<00:00:54.640> so<00:00:55.269> it's

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:55.479 
used in these different settings so it's

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:58.799 
used in these different settings so it's
important<00:00:56.110> for<00:00:56.440> patients<00:00:56.710> to<00:00:57.070> have<00:00:57.339> access<00:00:58.089> to

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809 
important for patients to have access to

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:01.289 
important for patients to have access to
medical<00:00:59.260> oncologists<00:00:59.979> and<00:01:00.070> also<00:01:00.549> to<00:01:00.610> surgeons

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:01.299 
medical oncologists and also to surgeons

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:04.110 
medical oncologists and also to surgeons
who<00:01:01.900> are<00:01:02.170> familiar<00:01:02.409> with<00:01:02.830> not<00:01:03.729> only<00:01:03.760> the

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
who are familiar with not only the

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.230 
who are familiar with not only the
Oncotype<00:01:04.780> DX<00:01:04.809> test<00:01:05.320> the<00:01:06.130> indications<00:01:06.820> forward

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
Oncotype DX test the indications forward

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.320 
Oncotype DX test the indications forward
in<00:01:07.330> the<00:01:07.420> applications<00:01:08.140> of<00:01:08.350> it<00:01:09.150> one<00:01:10.150> of<00:01:10.240> the

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
in the applications of it one of the

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.730 
in the applications of it one of the
problems<00:01:10.720> that<00:01:10.780> we've<00:01:11.020> got<00:01:11.229> were<00:01:11.470> such<00:01:11.710> a

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
problems that we've got were such a

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.050 
problems that we've got were such a
diverse<00:01:12.250> country<00:01:12.640> with<00:01:13.240> patients<00:01:13.900> living<00:01:14.320> and

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
diverse country with patients living and

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.090 
diverse country with patients living and
working<00:01:16.060> in<00:01:16.480> large<00:01:16.750> metropolitan<00:01:17.050> areas<00:01:17.890> and
