from here on RTX wireless phone extender

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.210 
from here on RTX wireless phone extender
it's<00:00:03.389> basically<00:00:03.750> the<00:00:03.870> data<00:00:03.990> of<00:00:04.350> a<00:00:04.500> base<00:00:04.710> and<00:00:05.040> an

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
it's basically the data of a base and an

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.340 
it's basically the data of a base and an
extension<00:00:05.790> unit<00:00:06.150> okay<00:00:06.750> so<00:00:06.810> I'm<00:00:07.020> just<00:00:07.080> going<00:00:07.290> to

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
extension unit okay so I'm just going to

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.870 
extension unit okay so I'm just going to
give<00:00:07.470> a<00:00:07.500> quick<00:00:07.649> overview<00:00:07.859> what<00:00:08.429> comes

give a quick overview what comes

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.910 
give a quick overview what comes
physically<00:00:09.389> within<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:09.719> box<00:00:09.900> here<00:00:10.170> you<00:00:10.380> have

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
physically within the box here you have

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.499 
physically within the box here you have
a<00:00:10.980> phone<00:00:11.219> car<00:00:11.610> here<00:00:11.910> it's<00:00:12.179> basically

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
a phone car here it's basically

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.079 
a phone car here it's basically
terminated<00:00:13.200> with<00:00:13.410> rj11<00:00:14.250> standard<00:00:14.849> phone

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
connectors with a user manual and we

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.939 
connectors with a user manual and we
have<00:00:18.119> these<00:00:18.300> adapters<00:00:18.930> here<00:00:19.170> which<00:00:19.740> are

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
have these adapters here which are

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.029 
have these adapters here which are
basically<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.490> UK<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.330> rj11<00:00:22.230> adapters<00:00:22.619> normally

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
basically a UK to rj11 adapters normally

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.710 
basically a UK to rj11 adapters normally
would<00:00:23.220> need<00:00:23.490> these<00:00:23.640> in<00:00:23.820> Ireland<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.330> then<00:00:24.600> we

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
would need these in Ireland and then we

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.689 
would need these in Ireland and then we
have<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.960> actual<00:00:25.109> key<00:00:25.680> thing<00:00:25.920> here<00:00:25.949> which<00:00:26.580> is

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
have the actual key thing here which is

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.730 
have the actual key thing here which is
the<00:00:26.820> base<00:00:27.029> unit<00:00:27.300> here<00:00:27.689> but<00:00:28.109> we<00:00:28.410> see<00:00:28.590> we've

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
the base unit here but we see we've

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.009 
the base unit here but we see we've
marked<00:00:28.949> it<00:00:29.039> here<00:00:29.099> just<00:00:29.400> as<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.519> master<00:00:30.029> unit<00:00:30.179> and

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
marked it here just as a master unit and

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.479 
marked it here just as a master unit and
then<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.349> extension<00:00:31.859> unit<00:00:32.099> which<00:00:32.219> is<00:00:32.340> also

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
then the extension unit which is also

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.150 
then the extension unit which is also
called<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.910> slave<00:00:33.180> unit<00:00:33.690> okay<00:00:34.170> so<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.739> give<00:00:35.130> a

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
called a slave unit okay so to give a

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.590 
called a slave unit okay so to give a
theory<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:35.670> how<00:00:35.910> this<00:00:36.120> should<00:00:36.360> work

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
theory of how this should work

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.930 
theory of how this should work
it's<00:00:37.110> called<00:00:37.410> Wireless<00:00:38.010> because<00:00:38.640> if<00:00:38.760> you

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
it's called Wireless because if you

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.270 
it's called Wireless because if you
don't<00:00:39.210> actually<00:00:39.600> using<00:00:40.410> this<00:00:40.530> on<00:00:40.920> your<00:00:40.980> ship

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
don't actually using this on your ship

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.770 
don't actually using this on your ship
if<00:00:41.399> you're<00:00:41.550> trying<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.790> put<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:41.969> phone<00:00:42.239> pointing

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
if you're trying to put a phone pointing

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.729 
if you're trying to put a phone pointing
in<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:42.989> new<00:00:43.140> location

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
in the new location

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.920 
in the new location
you<00:00:44.010> don't<00:00:44.250> need<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.879> run<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.539> fall<00:00:45.809> in

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
you don't need to run and you fall in

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.130 
you don't need to run and you fall in
line<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.440> uses<00:00:47.510> electrical<00:00:48.510> cabling<00:00:48.899> that's

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
line it uses electrical cabling that's

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.260 
line it uses electrical cabling that's
in<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.469> walls<00:00:49.649> already<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.520> basically<00:00:51.000> it

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
in the walls already so basically it

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.600 
in the walls already so basically it
takes<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.750> telephone<00:00:52.199> signal<00:00:52.649> sends<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.430> down

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
takes a telephone signal sends it down

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.090 
takes a telephone signal sends it down
the<00:00:53.879> electrical<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.600> mains<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.500> pops<00:00:55.920> it

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
the electrical and mains and pops it

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.160 
the electrical and mains and pops it
back<00:00:56.250> at<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.579> far<00:00:56.820> end<00:00:57.059> through<00:00:57.539> there<00:00:57.780> and

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
back at the far end through there and

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.869 
back at the far end through there and
the<00:00:58.859> extension<00:00:59.640> unit<00:00:59.910> okay<00:01:00.890> so<00:01:01.890> with<00:01:02.699> this

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
the extension unit okay so with this

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.170 
the extension unit okay so with this
they<00:01:03.120> have<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.270> range<00:01:03.510> about<00:01:03.899> 50<00:01:04.290> meters<00:01:04.710> and

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
they have a range about 50 meters and

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.940 
they have a range about 50 meters and
some<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.390> key<00:01:06.659> reasons<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.380> do<00:01:07.530> this<00:01:07.710> as

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
some of the key reasons you do this as

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.590 
some of the key reasons you do this as
far<00:01:08.220> as<00:01:08.369> but<00:01:08.700> if<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:08.850> just<00:01:09.000> want<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.299> put<00:01:09.420> in<00:01:09.570> a

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
far as but if you just want to put in a

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.230 
far as but if you just want to put in a
straightforward<00:01:09.960> form<00:01:10.590> point<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:11.240> new

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
straightforward form point a new

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.030 
straightforward form point a new
location<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.869> could<00:01:12.990> use<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.320> for<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.590> if

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
location you could use it for that if

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.770 
location you could use it for that if
you<00:01:14.159> want<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.369> put<00:01:14.549> in<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.700> fax<00:01:15.000> machine<00:01:15.210> you

bedroom<00:01:38.790> there<00:01:39.090> may<00:01:39.180> be<00:01:39.210> no<00:01:39.450> telephone<00:01:39.900> there

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
bedroom there may be no telephone there

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.840 
bedroom there may be no telephone there
can<00:01:40.439> be<00:01:40.470> quite<00:01:40.770> awkward<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.400> difficult<00:01:41.549> a

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
can be quite awkward and difficult a

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.999 
can be quite awkward and difficult a
rollin<00:01:42.299> telephone<00:01:42.720> cable<00:01:43.079> there<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:43.710> use

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
rollin telephone cable there so you use

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.190 
rollin telephone cable there so you use
a<00:01:44.040> unit<00:01:44.490> like<00:01:44.610> this<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:45.299> do<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.600> so<00:01:45.990> what<00:01:46.110> I'm

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
a unit like this to do it so what I'm

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.569 
a unit like this to do it so what I'm
going<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.380> do<00:01:46.500> now<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:46.860> just<00:01:47.009> give<00:01:47.189> an<00:01:47.280> overview

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
going to do now is just give an overview

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.280 
going to do now is just give an overview
of<00:01:47.850> how<00:01:48.000> exactly<00:01:48.479> how<00:01:48.600> we're<00:01:48.750> gonna<00:01:48.930> install

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
of how exactly how we're gonna install

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.039 
of how exactly how we're gonna install
this<00:01:49.619> so<00:01:50.280> we<00:01:50.520> took<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.790> scenario<00:01:51.329> where<00:01:51.659> we<00:01:51.689> had

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
this so we took a scenario where we had

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.440 
this so we took a scenario where we had
we'll<00:01:52.409> say<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.860> phone<00:01:53.340> plug<00:01:53.670> in<00:01:53.880> our<00:01:54.000> hallway

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
we'll say a phone plug in our hallway

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.080 
we'll say a phone plug in our hallway
would<00:01:54.840> simply<00:01:55.140> take<00:01:55.350> this<00:01:55.590> cable<00:01:56.070> here<00:01:56.100> and

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
would simply take this cable here and

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.580 
would simply take this cable here and
and<00:01:57.689> we'd<00:01:58.140> simply<00:01:58.320> connect<00:01:58.710> in<00:01:58.890> here<00:02:00.469> so<00:02:01.469> it

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
and we'd simply connect in here so it

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.170 
and we'd simply connect in here so it
should<00:02:01.619> connect<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:02.130> lead<00:02:02.310> in<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.729> if<00:02:03.090> we

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
should connect that lead in and if we

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.649 
should connect that lead in and if we
look<00:02:03.450> here<00:02:03.750> at<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.200> base<00:02:04.380> huge<00:02:05.509> just<00:02:06.509> two

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
look here at the base huge just two

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.479 
look here at the base huge just two
inputs<00:02:07.049> here<00:02:07.170> we<00:02:07.530> can<00:02:07.680> use<00:02:07.710> either<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.160> port

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
inputs here we can use either a port

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.460 
inputs here we can use either a port
completely<00:02:09.239> interchangeable<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.989> just<00:02:10.289> push

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
completely interchangeable I just push

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.400 
completely interchangeable I just push
it<00:02:10.649> in<00:02:10.800> here<00:02:11.069> and<00:02:11.430> what's<00:02:11.580> happened<00:02:11.940> now<00:02:12.000> is

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
it in here and what's happened now is

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.070 
it in here and what's happened now is
you<00:02:12.760> will<00:02:13.760> be<00:02:13.910> connected<00:02:14.360> now<00:02:14.510> to<00:02:14.540> fall<00:02:14.990> in

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
you will be connected now to fall in

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.900 
you will be connected now to fall in
line<00:02:15.260> so<00:02:15.710> what<00:02:16.070> we<00:02:16.160> can<00:02:16.280> do<00:02:16.400> is<00:02:16.580> we<00:02:16.730> have<00:02:16.820> an

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
line so what we can do is we have an

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.850 
line so what we can do is we have an
output<00:02:17.330> port<00:02:17.600> on<00:02:17.840> it<00:02:17.870> here<00:02:18.140> so<00:02:18.500> we<00:02:18.680> had<00:02:18.830> a

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
output port on it here so we had a

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.290 
output port on it here so we had a
telephone<00:02:19.400> it's<00:02:19.640> if<00:02:19.730> we<00:02:19.820> connect<00:02:20.120> the

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
telephone it's if we connect the

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.750 
telephone it's if we connect the
telephone<00:02:20.480> back<00:02:21.260> in<00:02:21.530> here<00:02:21.830> and<00:02:22.040> we'll<00:02:22.430> be<00:02:22.490> live

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
telephone back in here and we'll be live

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.930 
telephone back in here and we'll be live
while<00:02:23.420> to<00:02:23.960> actually<00:02:24.380> send<00:02:24.770> signal<00:02:25.430> down

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
while to actually send signal down

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.060 
while to actually send signal down
through<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.540> electrical<00:02:26.930> cables<00:02:27.350> all<00:02:27.530> we<00:02:27.920> do

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
through the electrical cables all we do

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.970 
through the electrical cables all we do
now<00:02:28.250> come<00:02:28.730> on<00:02:28.820> out<00:02:28.970> I<00:02:29.150> mean<00:02:29.510> clog<00:02:29.840> in<00:02:30.080> this<00:02:30.620> unit

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
now come on out I mean clog in this unit

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.080 
now come on out I mean clog in this unit
so<00:02:31.460> the<00:02:31.520> first<00:02:31.760> thing<00:02:31.940> we'll<00:02:32.030> of<00:02:32.180> plug<00:02:32.720> it<00:02:32.810> in

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
so the first thing we'll of plug it in

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.820 
so the first thing we'll of plug it in
instantly<00:02:35.090> this<00:02:35.540> light<00:02:35.780> will<00:02:36.080> turn<00:02:36.260> green<00:02:36.320> so

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
instantly this light will turn green so

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.620 
instantly this light will turn green so
with<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.280> base<00:02:37.460> unit<00:02:37.880> the<00:02:38.120> light<00:02:38.300> always

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
with the base unit the light always

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.980 
with the base unit the light always
turns<00:02:39.140> green<00:02:39.410> okay<00:02:40.070> it's<00:02:40.940> not<00:02:41.300> looking<00:02:41.600> for

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
turns green okay it's not looking for

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.620 
turns green okay it's not looking for
anything<00:02:42.230> else<00:02:42.500> its<00:02:42.830> base<00:02:43.340> you<00:02:44.210> know<00:02:44.360> and

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
anything else its base you know and

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.200 
anything else its base you know and
that's<00:02:44.810> what<00:02:44.960> a<00:02:44.990> green<00:02:45.230> light<00:02:45.380> comes<00:02:45.650> on<00:02:45.800> now

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
that's what a green light comes on now

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.850 
that's what a green light comes on now
inside<00:02:47.210> the<00:02:47.330> box<00:02:47.480> we<00:02:47.750> have<00:02:47.780> a<00:02:47.930> slave<00:02:48.290> unit<00:02:48.740> the

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
inside the box we have a slave unit the

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.950 
inside the box we have a slave unit the
extension<00:02:49.310> unit<00:02:49.550> and<00:02:49.730> it<00:02:49.970> comes<00:02:50.180> prepared

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
extension unit and it comes prepared

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.070 
extension unit and it comes prepared
with<00:02:51.500> this<00:02:51.680> so<00:02:52.250> this<00:02:52.490> base<00:02:52.910> unit<00:02:53.330> is<00:02:53.420> already

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
with this so this base unit is already

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.080 
with this so this base unit is already
looking<00:02:54.350> for<00:02:54.680> an<00:02:54.740> exact<00:02:55.040> frequency<00:02:55.640> of<00:02:55.670> this

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
looking for an exact frequency of this

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.350 
looking for an exact frequency of this
expand<00:02:56.570> the<00:02:56.870> master<00:02:57.050> unit<00:02:57.470> so<00:02:57.970> it's<00:02:58.970> a<00:02:59.090> matter

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
expand the master unit so it's a matter

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.240 
expand the master unit so it's a matter
of<00:02:59.510> poem<00:02:59.990> plane<00:03:00.230> so<00:03:00.710> we<00:03:00.890> had<00:03:01.040> a<00:03:01.070> situation

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
of poem plane so we had a situation

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.300 
of poem plane so we had a situation
where<00:03:01.790> we<00:03:01.850> code<00:03:02.210> this<00:03:02.390> unit<00:03:02.780> in<00:03:02.960> and<00:03:03.290> about<00:03:04.130> it

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
where we code this unit in and about it

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.460 
where we code this unit in and about it
may<00:03:04.520> be<00:03:04.580> turtle<00:03:05.090> forty<00:03:05.420> meters<00:03:05.720> away<00:03:05.840> when<00:03:06.350> we

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
may be turtle forty meters away when we

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.680 
may be turtle forty meters away when we
plug<00:03:06.710> it<00:03:06.830> in<00:03:06.920> initially<00:03:07.610> as<00:03:07.790> a<00:03:08.000> flash<00:03:08.360> and

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
plug it in initially as a flash and

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.410 
plug it in initially as a flash and
green<00:03:09.560> red<00:03:09.890> and<00:03:10.130> then<00:03:10.460> as<00:03:10.580> gold<00:03:10.790> solid<00:03:11.060> green

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
green red and then as gold solid green

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.500 
green red and then as gold solid green
when<00:03:11.660> it<00:03:11.750> actually<00:03:12.290> recognizes<00:03:12.860> that<00:03:13.520> it's

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
when it actually recognizes that it's

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.260 
when it actually recognizes that it's
found<00:03:14.750> the<00:03:14.870> master<00:03:15.230> unit<00:03:15.470> so<00:03:16.070> I'm<00:03:16.400> just<00:03:16.880> one

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
found the master unit so I'm just one

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:18.400 
found the master unit so I'm just one
part<00:03:17.600> you're<00:03:17.750> going<00:03:17.840> to<00:03:17.930> make<00:03:18.020> before<00:03:18.170> it

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
part you're going to make before it

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.260 
part you're going to make before it
focus<00:03:18.709> in<00:03:18.890> there's<00:03:19.370> a<00:03:19.400> switch<00:03:19.730> here<00:03:19.970> and

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
focus in there's a switch here and

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:21.640 
focus in there's a switch here and
you'll<00:03:20.450> notice<00:03:20.480> on<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:20.990> switch<00:03:21.200> is<00:03:21.320> just<00:03:21.470> two

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
you'll notice on the switch is just two

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.100 
you'll notice on the switch is just two
settings<00:03:22.130> there's<00:03:22.640> s<00:03:22.910> which<00:03:23.540> is<00:03:23.570> for<00:03:23.900> voice

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
settings there's s which is for voice

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.800 
settings there's s which is for voice
and<00:03:24.380> C<00:03:24.860> which<00:03:25.190> is<00:03:25.310> for<00:03:25.490> data<00:03:25.670> now<00:03:26.360> these<00:03:26.600> units

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
and C which is for data now these units

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.960 
and C which is for data now these units
become<00:03:27.260> by<00:03:27.470> defaults<00:03:27.980> at<00:03:28.100> the<00:03:28.220> s<00:03:28.370> but<00:03:28.880> if

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
just going to come in here and initially

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.030 
just going to come in here and initially
it's<00:03:48.340> green<00:03:48.610> red<00:03:48.910> green<00:03:49.260> and<00:03:50.260> now<00:03:50.470> it's<00:03:50.650> solid

it's green red green and now it's solid

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.830 
it's green red green and now it's solid
green<00:03:51.280> it's<00:03:51.550> out<00:03:51.760> to<00:03:51.910> recognizing<00:03:52.600> the<00:03:52.660> base

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
green it's out to recognizing the base

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.930 
green it's out to recognizing the base
unit<00:03:53.230> so<00:03:53.560> what<00:03:53.770> the<00:03:53.920> solid<00:03:54.250> green<00:03:54.520> light<00:03:54.730> is

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
unit so what the solid green light is

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.480 
unit so what the solid green light is
telling<00:03:55.270> me<00:03:55.390> is<00:03:55.540> I<00:03:55.780> know<00:03:56.080> her<00:03:56.680> the<00:03:56.770> master<00:03:57.190> unit

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 
telling me is I know her the master unit

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.670 
telling me is I know her the master unit
is<00:03:57.730> I'm<00:03:58.240> getting<00:03:58.569> a<00:03:58.750> signal<00:03:58.930> from<00:03:59.380> it

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
is I'm getting a signal from it

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.920 
is I'm getting a signal from it
I<00:03:59.709> can<00:04:00.220> output<00:04:00.670> a<00:04:00.880> telephone<00:04:01.360> signal<00:04:01.780> from

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
I can output a telephone signal from

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.600 
I can output a telephone signal from
here<00:04:02.200> as<00:04:02.380> long<00:04:02.800> as<00:04:02.980> there's<00:04:03.130> a<00:04:03.190> telephone

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
here as long as there's a telephone

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.520 
here as long as there's a telephone
signal<00:04:04.000> going<00:04:04.360> into<00:04:04.570> the<00:04:04.780> master<00:04:05.170> of<00:04:05.290> course

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
signal going into the master of course

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.670 
signal going into the master of course
okay<00:04:05.890> so<00:04:06.630> if<00:04:07.630> it<00:04:07.750> was<00:04:07.840> a<00:04:07.900> situation<00:04:08.110> where<00:04:08.530> you

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
okay so if it was a situation where you

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.210 
okay so if it was a situation where you
came<00:04:08.830> along<00:04:09.040> and<00:04:10.050> the<00:04:11.050> master<00:04:11.530> unit<00:04:11.680> was<00:04:12.010> too

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
came along and the master unit was too

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.670 
came along and the master unit was too
far<00:04:12.520> away<00:04:12.670> or<00:04:13.000> not<00:04:13.150> plugged<00:04:13.450> in<00:04:13.630> quite<00:04:14.410> quickly

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
far away or not plugged in quite quickly

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.470 
far away or not plugged in quite quickly
the<00:04:14.830> slave<00:04:15.160> unit<00:04:15.610> would<00:04:15.700> realize<00:04:16.150> it<00:04:16.329> as<00:04:16.450> a

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
the slave unit would realize it as a

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.690 
the slave unit would realize it as a
problem<00:04:16.780> and<00:04:17.109> it's<00:04:17.530> green<00:04:17.829> red<00:04:18.160> now<00:04:18.430> it's

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
problem and it's green red now it's

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.099 
problem and it's green red now it's
flashing<00:04:18.970> it's<00:04:19.329> looking<00:04:19.720> for<00:04:19.870> the<00:04:19.930> master

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
flashing it's looking for the master

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.740 
flashing it's looking for the master
it's<00:04:20.739> telling<00:04:21.160> us<00:04:21.220> that<00:04:21.280> it<00:04:21.519> knows<00:04:21.790> it's<00:04:22.419> paid

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
it's telling us that it knows it's paid

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.590 
it's telling us that it knows it's paid
for<00:04:23.040> paired<00:04:24.040> with<00:04:24.460> a<00:04:24.520> particular<00:04:24.910> master<00:04:25.120> but

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
for paired with a particular master but

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.450 
for paired with a particular master but
it<00:04:25.690> just<00:04:25.870> can't<00:04:26.080> find<00:04:26.440> it<00:04:26.590> and<00:04:26.860> if<00:04:26.980> we<00:04:27.070> put<00:04:27.280> this

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
it just can't find it and if we put this

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.480 
it just can't find it and if we put this
back<00:04:27.640> in<00:04:27.880> here<00:04:29.010> it's<00:04:30.010> the<00:04:30.100> same<00:04:30.280> procedure

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
back in here it's the same procedure

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.150 
back in here it's the same procedure
again<00:04:30.790> quite<00:04:31.360> quickly<00:04:31.600> and<00:04:31.900> recognize<00:04:32.770> it<00:04:32.800> and

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
again quite quickly and recognize it and

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.180 
again quite quickly and recognize it and
it<00:04:33.310> goes<00:04:33.460> to<00:04:33.580> solid<00:04:33.910> green<00:04:34.150> so<00:04:34.900> at<00:04:35.530> this<00:04:35.919> new

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
it goes to solid green so at this new

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.220 
it goes to solid green so at this new
location<00:04:36.400> here<00:04:37.060> what<00:04:37.510> would<00:04:37.720> we<00:04:37.840> use<00:04:37.870> it<00:04:38.200> for

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
location here what would we use it for

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.680 
location here what would we use it for
well<00:04:38.800> in<00:04:38.919> the<00:04:39.010> situation<00:04:39.640> here<00:04:39.820> what<00:04:40.270> actually

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
well in the situation here what actually

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.540 
well in the situation here what actually
using<00:04:40.930> this<00:04:41.050> guy<00:04:41.260> box<00:04:41.560> and<00:04:41.830> I<00:04:41.919> took<00:04:41.980> this<00:04:42.250> Sky

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
using this guy box and I took this Sky

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.909 
using this guy box and I took this Sky
box<00:04:42.790> that<00:04:43.060> we<00:04:43.120> have<00:04:43.180> here<00:04:43.510> first<00:04:44.470> thing<00:04:44.650> I<00:04:44.740> do

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
box that we have here first thing I do

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.060 
box that we have here first thing I do
is<00:04:45.100> I<00:04:45.130> simply<00:04:45.400> take<00:04:45.640> a<00:04:45.700> cable<00:04:46.060> here<00:04:46.950> connect<00:04:47.950> it

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
is I simply take a cable here connect it

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.159 
is I simply take a cable here connect it
into<00:04:48.190> the<00:04:48.280> sky<00:04:48.550> loves<00:04:48.790> here<00:04:49.090> and<00:04:49.300> run<00:04:49.990> it<00:04:50.140> back

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
into the sky loves here and run it back

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:55.170 
into the sky loves here and run it back
and<00:04:52.440> connect<00:04:53.440> it<00:04:53.590> into<00:04:54.220> this<00:04:54.430> point<00:04:54.729> here<00:04:55.000> and

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
and connect it into this point here and

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.020 
and connect it into this point here and
that<00:04:55.750> means<00:04:56.020> now<00:04:56.320> that<00:04:56.650> the<00:04:56.979> phone<00:04:57.220> can<00:04:57.520> output

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
that means now that the phone can output

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.670 
that means now that the phone can output
from<00:04:58.150> this<00:04:58.300> box<00:04:58.479> to<00:04:58.750> connect<00:04:59.020> directly<00:04:59.169> to<00:04:59.470> my

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
from this box to connect directly to my

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.190 
from this box to connect directly to my
Sky<00:04:59.950> box

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
Sky box

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.719 
Sky box
it<00:05:02.200> simply<00:05:02.530> means<00:05:02.680> then<00:05:03.010> that<00:05:03.040> when<00:05:03.520> we<00:05:03.610> go

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:03.729 
it simply means then that when we go

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:04.890 
it simply means then that when we go
through<00:05:03.760> the<00:05:04.060> format's<00:05:04.510> this<00:05:04.750> will
