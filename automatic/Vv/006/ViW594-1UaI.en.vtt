 but hey if here in caverns and I'm 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.900
 seeing that there are many subscribers and that 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.610
 nobody is going to fall legally then 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.710

 vila what would happen or small 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:31.380
 worth going back and forth until 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.390
 we fall to the last level we can do 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.219
 that fall to the void or that burn like 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.050

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.280
 very very tasty and delicious and we are going to 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.110
 do the tutorial on another map where not 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.059
 there are so many subscribers worth we go to 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.070
 I'm afraid I want this to come out 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.070
 I live and morelos 92 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.790
 and very good to all vaquitas and 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.160
 welcome to a new campaign a 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.990
 subscriber today yours will be good I say 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.370
 I the case that today we are going to make a 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.680
 very troll trap in fact in the most 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.790
 troll that I brought to the channel I think good 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.229
 of which more because basically it's going 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.880
 pushing from one side to the other until 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.380
 you fall to the bottom, you know that 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.760
 you can send any kind of trap 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.110
 as long as you are subscribers to 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.420
 hashtag that you have in the title of the 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.240
 video and on twitter I see it all me what 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.770
 great step and there are many and no no no 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.420
 I can do them all is worth twice to the 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.360
 week usually bring subscriber trap 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.580
 and public then the tweet where m good 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.130
 your tweet where he shows me in the photo 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.360
 ok let's polish this and beira saco 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.640
 I wanted to make a troll house with this 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.590
 but I'm going to take more and it's a 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.390
 foolishness really looks at yourself 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.840
 Well let's go make a boat 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.729
 normalito is worth on this map got me 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.290
 this map but because he killed chaos you know 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.149
 but I did not want to go in here but hey 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.490
 I will turn off as I can to see this well 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.930
 the case we are going to transform where they have 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.729
 to enter through noses because if not 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.630
 it enters the frame no no I can not avoid 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.009
 down 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.740
 so I think that with that I'm worth 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.180
 let's cover and disguise this here 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.530
 and some naughty noses before me 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.990
 I have to leave the game because I 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.700
 I knew many people but good in this 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.399
 in this game then not less then 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.280
 bad you know good we're going to do here in the 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.720
 control that would be to place a 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.489
 piston does not have to be tested 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.519
 sticky just a wooden piston 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.500
 and here it is going to push and well they are going 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.300
 to fall the first thing is that they fall and down 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.580
 we started to push people worth 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.069
 then let's go to remove this already 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.090
 this to see we are going to cover here yes by 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.440
 here is where they are going to fall then 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.110
 I'm going to remove this and we're going to put in 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:32.280
 first already push voucher is super 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.410
 simple to do this would be first 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.090
 placing a droplet of remains is worth the 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.709
 milk or days but they have given me they have not 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.030
 given tools I shit on everything but 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.640
 I'm going to make a table I think it's always 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.900
 the same thing happens to me I do not know how I do it 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.700
 let's make a spike at least for 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.319
 go faster than in the long run 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.200
 profitable you know 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:51.150
 then we go to a peak and go to 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.489
 place a piston here if it can be 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.200
 It has to be sticky because if you have 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.239
 sticky you do not have to restart the 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.159
 trap or it is already placed again the 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.569
 block where before then so that by 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:01.219
 here unnim wrong I shit on everything 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.299
 OK 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:04.990
 let's put the plate here still 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.120
 let's do 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.130
 that the plates are activated then 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.870
 when you approach good we are activated 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.460
 because I was putting the piston in, but the 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.190
 piston goes a little later then 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:18.580
 I'm going to remove it, fuck, as I'm worth, it's 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.840
 say here here yes 2011 active pushes and 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.660
 it is pushing you from one place to another 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.090
 say when someone falls justly 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.700
 here or you push and you hit a milk or 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.920
 I almost killed myself worth this first 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.260
 first push then now we're going to 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.930
 do the second part is to say let's 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.940
 come here and when someone bites 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.390
 and fall down here we're going to push 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.830
 to the left and here it is 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.780
 let's stop and then to drop by here 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.310
 just then now let's go down 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.750
 and we are going to place the last push 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.250
 you can place it as they increase 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.200
 well and good thought but well that what 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.860
 done the first one now I'm going to throw it to 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:56.170
 emptiness that fucks more and that holds 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.630
 let's put this here we're going to 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.830
 place a drop of rest here a 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.050
 block there has to be a block worth 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.880
 up here goes the sticky piston a 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.740
 and any block is already ready 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.510
 now I would go to the plate we left it on 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.190
 and this automatically restarts 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.320
 it is to say when a block stays 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.450
 here off is going to put in a milk the 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.550
 uncle as someone bite this is that 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.020
 mediara choose ar but live or be from 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.060
 I really going to miss the fucking of 

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:21.340
 milk of women because this huitrÃ³n 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.600
 really the most troll then we go to 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.160
 go up now above this is already 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.560
 ready if you want to do more push 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.700
 later you will have to be longer 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.500
 but you're going to laugh more than ever 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.220
 place more thrusts more laughter that's 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.810
 Clear 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.820
 ok and nothing will we see if it stings any 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.980
 see first good here would go logically 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.150
 here goes the last plate so that it arrives 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.100
 down I'm going to place a block here 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.470
 here another one just in case I have to go 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.840
 on the one hand another and this I take it better 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.450
 because I'm seeing that I have to go for 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.040
 someone we are going to go for he wants 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.750
 I hope someone that this is very 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.130
 cool I hope you are with a little hand 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.720
 up already said at the beginning but it's 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.610
 that this is going to cost me that it stings 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.200
 someone but a lot little that does 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.110
 follow the little one look how heavy 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.360
 ok let's go for that one is not going very well 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:04.700
 equipped is better than me is this guy 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.560
 touch and kill me kill me kill me 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.840
 ok, the bad thing is that I do not wear 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.580
 last and I am orderly and it is a heavy 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.560
 with a bow and I do not like anything 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.120
 over subscribers or good because 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.390
 At least, as I come, I think 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:20.810
 put a milk of noses we are going to cover 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:22.820
 what really the young gentleman is that is 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.580
 very strong this is going a thousand times better 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.530
 team that youtube really hurt this 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.880
 do not throw this away, it just happens to me 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.770
 let's little by little I do not even want to look is 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.440
 I'm serious about where you are, okay, let's go 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.000
 we go a little more and we get out 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:38.180
 variable goes for shoulders what it what 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.380
 what is worth it is already to be had if it comes 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.770
 if you are a subscriber you are going to sting you are going to 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:43.970
 put a little milk mecca cheer up 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:46.370
 that I have warm milk for you come 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.320
 I want to say hello to your mom come 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.540
 small baby come closer about small 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.710
 ok wait we hope we put a 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.710
 block one two three 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:58.400
 is the gun is pushing the other wing 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:00.560
 to your house a greeting to your mom to your dad 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.270
 to his cousin Jonathan and everyone else already 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.680
 its opening I could not believe that 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:09.610
 have really bitten that this is the 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:09.610
 milk is good 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.660
 and it makes the global mother do I 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.660
 I shit on all the grapes lungs or this 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:19.600
 Uncle touches me and kills me 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:22.280
 look listen has been totally 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.080
 updated the trap is worth and has 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.850
 rebooted would just have to place the 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.990
 main frame but well I'm not going 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:29.300
 to do because this subscriber 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.220
 logically because it goes like a frog 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.740
 side by side not my mother my mother 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.270
 my mother my mother okay we go to 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.800
 try to win but this is very dicey 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.690
 because the time is already spent in the 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.100
 trap and I hope it sends armor and very 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.530
 big armor would face me but it's 

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:45.440
 who watches how the uncle goes or little ones to 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:46.639
 no no no no no i 'm not going to try 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.889
 make him another book I'm going to do the one 

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:50.500
 block or something weird that is touching him 

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:52.729
 something weird to beat this guy is 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.380
 for less there we go there 

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:56.180
 I do not even want to look let's go let's go to the 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:59.630
 the end is going to throw me and I'm going to piss off and 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:01.610
 I do not want to see where the bad is 

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:03.080
 it's not that they have of it's that it's going from a 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.550
 side by side like a damn frog is that 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.320
 can not do anything but good the trap 

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:08.389
 It has worked very well in its opening 

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.139

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:10.370
 chula vale 

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:12.440

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:14.690
 up and tonight live in tweets 

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:16.550
 It's worth posting a video here a little 

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:18.169
 I will do it in 2.0 and if you feel like it 

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:20.270
 play confessed that with me then there 

00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:21.620

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:24.610
