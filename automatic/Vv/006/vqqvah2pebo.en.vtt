00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.369
 Profoto B2 brings unprecedented power and portability. 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:28.739
 Through an easy to use suit. 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:33.120
 I call it a suit because it contains everything I need to pack the studio on the road. 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.780
 Whether indoors or outdoors, the system's tools can meet all your shooting needs. 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.320
 During Beijing, I needed a studio light style lighting. 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.529
 And shooting outdoors. 

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:48.170
 I can't use my video light and the out-of-band lighting system. 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.979
 I need a multi-purpose system, 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.490
 The biggest challenge I have encountered before is how to control the light. 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.350
 Light is everywhere, but controlling light and output is another matter. 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.140
 I need a light shaping tool that allows me to move quickly and efficiently. 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.770
 No matter where I shoot in the world. 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:09.140
 The B2 system is equipped with a honeycomb, a beam tube, an octagonal softbox, a four-leaf light barrier, etc., so the tools are very portable. 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.940
 This is very practical for photographers who need to go everywhere. 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.900
 I am a photographer who walks and shoots. 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.000
 Most locations I shot today cannot be set 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.070
 Tripods, sandbags, or let five team members look at the equipment. 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.410
 Needless to say, I often travel around the world for weddings and portraits. 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.600
 The more portable and space-consuming devices, the better for me. 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.300
 In a special location, we have to move quickly to get the photo we want. 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.140
 Lightweight and powerful output usually cannot be both. 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.140
 But B2 is different. 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.200
 Another reason I like this system very much is its ease of use. Insert the lamp head to shoot. 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.349
 This is the ideal design for lighting equipment. 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.880
 With the built-in TTL system, I can use the metering system of Canon cameras. 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.690
 Use lights without manual metering. 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.499
 Let the system help metering under changing conditions. 

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:23.880
 The system also supports manual mode. If you have plenty of time, that's fine. 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.859
 Set up the lamp head and adjust to the output you think is the best. 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:29.609
 The lamp holder has a built-in Profoto wireless receiving system. 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:31.999
 You can also carry less and worry less about a piece of equipment. 

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:56.389
 250Ws power output, much higher than the dome light 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:03:00.620
 Often, portability means a trade-off in output. 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.650
 I need to control when to output, how to output, B2 will not disappoint me. 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.230
 This system provides whatever you want. 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.499
 By remote control flash, 

00:03:09.499 --> 00:03:12.699
 I can move quickly and adjust the output as needed 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.240
 Shooting on the Great Wall is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me. 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.870
 I can't have any negligence. 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.639
 I have to carry a reliable device. 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:29.260
 I am sure that the device will work properly under any conditions, 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.699
 It is easy to travel with the equipment you carry. 

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:34.609
 B2 has become part of my travel baggage. 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:36.609
 I also plan to apply it to my various businesses.
