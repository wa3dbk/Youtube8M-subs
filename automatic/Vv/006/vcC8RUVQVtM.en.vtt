00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.780
 hello andrew tkachenko today 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.540
 we will discuss with you 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.700
 not yet cabbage any cabbage 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.010
 cauliflower white cabbage 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.169
 cabbage cabbage have a lot of 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.660
 diverse subspecies and the most 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:23.849
 the main thing on which few people know but little 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.860
 who focuses on this many times 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:29.160
 noticed that cabbage starts to appear 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:34.460
 some kind of fat is not fatty 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:36.809
 the red vessels of which the courts blacken 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.540
 appear in the root zone of anger 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.350
 no cauliflower leaves 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.980
 or white cabbage and why is it 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.079
 happens 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.719
 few people attach importance to the fact that 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.120
 Nutrition cabbage is very important one 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.850
 of the main nutritional ingredients of all 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.100
 cabbage is sera sera that is not will 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.260
 sulfur of your soil and either in processing 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.629
 will your to just constantly get sick and 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.420
 it is necessary to always have to wear 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:07.229
 remember that our soils are practically no 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:10.010
 sulfur copper and boron what are these three elements 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.750
 Three elements must be applied 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.000
 man either in the form of fertilizer or 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.399
 videos from old process and now we 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.369
 let 's talk about leaf processing in order 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.659
 so as to protect our cabbage in 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.869
 first line on cabbage today 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.240
 talking from the disease is one of the most 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.969
 the best approaches that is nothing unnecessary 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.170
 came up with even in environmentally friendly 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:36.060
 week it is described that there are only three 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.860
 approved drugs permitted 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:43.070
 ecologically clean farming 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.070
 colloid is bordeaux mixture and 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.180
 dolomite flour is not soil deoxidation 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.770
 that is, we must do what you must 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.259
 at least once per season 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.100
 process all yours at least once 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:02:00.359
 cabbage in gray sulfur can be 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:04.560
 colloid can it still be sold in 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:05.340
 a kind of garden sulfur called that is it 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.729
 little friend 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.679
 makes that is one of the most 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.620
 common in our stores 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.060
 this green soap is also made on 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.660
 colloidal sulfur based 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:21.810
 i.e. the task is simple you handle 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.489
 plot increased everything painted back yes 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.980
 that is, not necessarily exactly in such 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.920
 Packed colloidal sulfur is supplied as 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.110
 liquid form and in the dry that is, it 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.150
 have under different names maybe 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.879
 You it will be called differently there is 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.769
 the tea with jed is also made here 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.989
 the back here is always described as acting 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:44.280
 substance yes on every drug there 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:48.540
 written 800 grams per kilogram server 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:52.319
 yes that is the task is sulfur 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.840
 it's like fire i'm processing i'm 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:57.299
 turn I process in field conditions 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.920
 not only cabbage gray works at least 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.349
 once a potato at least once 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.690
 tomatoes at least once pepper that is 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:07.980
 we are processing now talking about cabbage 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:10.920
 we process sulfur in the morning will 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.139
 unpleasant smell you go out will be such 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.180
 smell like a bit like rotten eggs this 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:17.100
 the smell will be half a day maybe day but 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.720
 but you see what your cabbage will be 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.880
 the whole sheet will rise 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.790
 olis will be such a bluish tint 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.290
 and the whole will glitter glitter she will 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.750
 straight rises and will reach for 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.389
 the sun yes that is sulfur removes the disease 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.510
 outward it's like the fire will be more outside 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:35.120
 passes not 45 you take the bar board with 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.280
 minus for 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.889
 Bordeaux mixture on the Internet look like 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.620
 it prepares correctly 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:46.239
 I will make a huge emphasis that is 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.340
 that you must vitara necessarily need 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:51.859
 Bordeaux mixture is a mixture of lime and 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.840
 copper sulphate yes yes it is 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:55.420
 everywhere the so-called blue stone and 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.120
 copper sulphate 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.629
 found the same packages here are poured copper 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.230
 vitriol 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:05.930
 and a bag of lime main accent 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:09.430
 known must be quicken by no means 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.299
 case, you can not take inquisitive then 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:15.650
 garden whitewash 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:17.840
 or lime pushonka or not that is 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.880
 necessarily what was not 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.880
 gatchina because here these living 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.460
 quality fresh lime garshina they 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:29.240
 also treat very well ie we 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:32.539
 in gray we bring the disease out and with copper and 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:36.280
 fresh lime suppress all 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:39.229
 bacteriosis nile tackle including sulfur 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:42.590
 drives away most pests then 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:44.840
 there is and here these combinations are still not 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.090
 man did not come up with better fungicides then 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.430
 there is better protection against disease than most 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:53.509
 pure it you just give a gray form 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.440
 power and bluestone with lime this 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:56.030
 Bordeaux mixture 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.250
 she is neutralized and that is she 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.740
 practically harmless to humans very 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.509
 short term 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.780
 you can not eat it already 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:07.250
 in a week can it all consume and 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.949
 follow the same way all 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:13.300
 cultural will not be on your shrubs 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:14.659
 curl disease some sulfur and 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:19.729
 Bordeaux mixture 

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:21.979
 that is, it is very important and each of you 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:24.289
 pay attention that your cabbage 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:25.070
 it will become more fun that is, it will become 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:28.280
 greener 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.750
 she will be less sick and afterwards 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:33.919
 will accumulate less disease in 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:36.880
 the soil as such, be sure to recognize 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:39.990
 read more 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:45.600
 ask questions I will answer you myself 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:48.210
 questions suggest topics for the video we 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:51.030
 We will consider all this, that is, to eat like mine 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:54.770
 opinion such people who come to us 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:59.580
 sharing experience and general already answer to 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:00.420
 almost any question you have on it all 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.800
 goodbye 

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.800
 health happiness is our destiny
