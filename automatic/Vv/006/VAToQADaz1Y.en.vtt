just<00:02:06.689> take<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.869> rocket<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.560> put<00:02:08.099> it<00:02:08.190> right

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
just take a rocket and put it right

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.750 
just take a rocket and put it right
there<00:02:08.310> okay<00:02:09.060> so<00:02:09.450> yeah<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:09.750> put<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.709> T&amp;T<00:02:11.069> for

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
there okay so yeah you put to T&amp;T for

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.309 
there okay so yeah you put to T&amp;T for
iron<00:02:11.970> ingots<00:02:12.239> and<00:02:12.360> an<00:02:12.569> armored<00:02:12.840> plate<00:02:13.050> and<00:02:13.260> you

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
iron ingots and an armored plate and you

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.009 
iron ingots and an armored plate and you
get<00:02:13.530> rockets<00:02:14.190> so<00:02:14.970> that's<00:02:15.180> how<00:02:15.360> you<00:02:15.420> make<00:02:15.629> the

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
get rockets so that's how you make the

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.770 
get rockets so that's how you make the
guard<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:17.160> Iron<00:02:17.640> Man<00:02:17.879> shoes<00:02:18.180> are<00:02:18.480> made<00:02:18.599> like

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
guard the Iron Man shoes are made like

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.430 
guard the Iron Man shoes are made like
this<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:21.120> iron<00:02:21.330> bed<00:02:21.540> pans<00:02:21.870> are<00:02:22.080> made<00:02:22.110> with

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
this the iron bed pans are made with

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.250 
this the iron bed pans are made with
four<00:02:22.680> for<00:02:23.280> electronics<00:02:23.790> for<00:02:24.209> rockets<00:02:24.630> and<00:02:24.780> pen

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
four for electronics for rockets and pen

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.170 
four for electronics for rockets and pen
shell<00:02:25.680> so<00:02:25.890> basically<00:02:26.340> you're<00:02:26.819> just<00:02:26.849> kind<00:02:27.150> of

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
shell so basically you're just kind of

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.940 
shell so basically you're just kind of
outlining<00:02:27.599> the<00:02:27.780> pen<00:02:27.989> shell<00:02:28.319> are<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.709> shells

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
outlining the pen shell are the shells

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.050 
outlining the pen shell are the shells
in<00:02:29.280> order<00:02:29.940> to<00:02:30.090> make<00:02:30.300> your<00:02:30.540> armor<00:02:31.459> so<00:02:32.459> and<00:02:32.730> then

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
in order to make your armor so and then

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.370 
in order to make your armor so and then
the<00:02:33.269> chest<00:02:33.510> clicks<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:33.780> little<00:02:33.989> bit<00:02:34.080> different

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
the chest clicks a little bit different

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.350 
the chest clicks a little bit different
you<00:02:34.890> need<00:02:35.040> to<00:02:35.160> make<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.459> powered<00:02:35.819> suit<00:02:36.030> first

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
you need to make the powered suit first

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.119 
you need to make the powered suit first
and<00:02:36.660> you<00:02:36.930> make<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.200> power<00:02:37.379> super<00:02:37.739> making<00:02:38.040> the

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
and you make the power super making the

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.190 
and you make the power super making the
arc<00:02:38.310> reactor<00:02:38.430> and<00:02:39.299> the<00:02:39.360> arc<00:02:39.630> reactor<00:02:39.750> is

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
arc reactor and the arc reactor is

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.140

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
now I'll like it just shows this and it

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.819 
now I'll like it just shows this and it
doesn't<00:03:42.000> really<00:03:42.150> tell<00:03:43.079> you<00:03:43.170> how<00:03:43.380> to<00:03:43.440> do<00:03:43.650> it<00:03:43.680> so

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
doesn't really tell you how to do it so

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:46.069 
doesn't really tell you how to do it so
if<00:03:44.519> you<00:03:44.700> guys<00:03:44.850> know<00:03:45.090> how<00:03:45.299> to<00:03:45.329> craft<00:03:45.690> these<00:03:45.930> I

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
if you guys know how to craft these I

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:47.720 
if you guys know how to craft these I
really<00:03:46.319> don't<00:03:46.500> know<00:03:46.560> how<00:03:46.769> to<00:03:46.799> I<00:03:47.220> think<00:03:47.549> it

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
really don't know how to I think it

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.309 
really don't know how to I think it
might<00:03:47.880> just<00:03:48.090> not<00:03:48.209> be<00:03:48.269> updated<00:03:48.569> yet<00:03:48.989> but<00:03:49.200> yeah

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
might just not be updated yet but yeah

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:50.660 
might just not be updated yet but yeah
you<00:03:49.380> can<00:03:49.500> get<00:03:49.739> these<00:03:49.889> and<00:03:50.040> creative<00:03:50.400> but<00:03:50.549> they

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
you can get these and creative but they

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.910 
you can get these and creative but they
do<00:03:50.730> the<00:03:50.940> exact<00:03:51.209> same<00:03:51.239> thing<00:03:51.660> as<00:03:51.810> these<00:03:52.170> do<00:03:52.380> so
