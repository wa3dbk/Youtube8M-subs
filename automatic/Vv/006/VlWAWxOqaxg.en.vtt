their body basically that swim pool when
it<00:06:07.390> gets<00:06:07.540> green<00:06:07.870> and<00:06:08.110> nasty<00:06:08.500> and<00:06:08.590> vodka<00:06:08.920> algae

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
it gets green and nasty and vodka algae

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.870 
it gets green and nasty and vodka algae
that<00:06:09.850> look<00:06:10.240> at<00:06:10.330> that<00:06:10.480> as<00:06:10.630> cancer<00:06:11.230> this<00:06:11.380> one

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:11.880 
that look at that as cancer this one
