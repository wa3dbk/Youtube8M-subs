00:05:58.349 --> 00:05:58.359 
oven it's still very hot so I have to

00:05:58.359 --> 00:06:00.689

of course it tastes good too so why not

00:06:18.059 --> 00:06:20.789

00:06:20.799 --> 00:06:23.579 
but on the other hand if you don't have
any<00:06:20.919> berries<00:06:21.399> you<00:06:21.969> might<00:06:22.149> even<00:06:22.359> just<00:06:22.599> plain<00:06:23.139> or
