00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:14.059
 Austria for us with a plummet vita machine 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:18.230
 Freight worked in Austria year 2000 and 6 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:21.230
 let's see her condition in the car 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.390

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:28.290
 then 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:30.270
 freestanding stove while all that is for me 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:33.059
 known let you show now for 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:38.940
 she wants a car worth the VAT there 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:41.610
 that is, having the saying did not remember yes 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.780
 now ask for exactly 19 or 20 percent 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.460
 weight at when the car crosses 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.100
 last frontier for union and will make 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.019
 mark and then return this difference 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.199
 with interest and we will talk 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:58.079
 about discounts for car see 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:09.479
 how much give in on to you now 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:13.920
 I show car Well, what we have here 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:24.440
 still waiting for a little rust such 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:24.440
 small chips on the hood then 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:41.040
 mileage at the car 273 1732 kilometers here 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.040
 us autonomy 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:02:09.580
 so on the wash should that still well 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:10.710
 still waiting for a little scratch there so 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.090
 here 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:19.600
 pursed and bumpers were seen when 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:22.230
 parking where the alarms are tucked in and 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.230
 basically everything 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.920
 well here 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:47.010
 no rust no dents 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:50.400
 interesting so here it is I do n't even know for 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:03:11.130
 why did you have to ask why 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:03:13.730
 put so here basically nothing 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.730
 by sex she 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:30.220
 but the steering wheel and such a moment if the car is a lot 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:33.640
 I usually went on this on the steering wheel 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:37.800
 such rubbed sti have you see it 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.870
 such one of the first signs if 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.690
 twisted run by us 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:46.660
 for example there was to it 100 150 000 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.750
 on the steering wheel one could say that the mileage 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:53.170
 wiped dry cleaning principle here 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:59.230
 the seat is made dirty just not so 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:04:02.280
 poked through and nothing pockets here for 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:06.070
 I don't know the salon you see no see 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:11.550
 such a cigarette does not smell but everything 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:11.550
 filthy everything needs to be cleaned and washed 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.780
 I myself 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:30.130
 but please raise your hand to me here one 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.130
 not very comfortable okay 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.590
 I will see the last one 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.100
 by must wait 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:57.029
 but in principle, the motor is dry, I do not see 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:59.479
 So that somewhere there were flows oil works 

00:04:57.029 --> 00:05:02.159
 basically 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:05.419
 clean now need to take a ride 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:05.419
 make a trial fart menu 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.760
 I 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.110
 and 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.210
 you 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:43.550
 but it turns out that we have already arrived 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.500
 in Nuremberg there we did not have time to shoot 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.750
 trial fart because it started very 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.419
 heavy rain came swiftly all 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:54.199
 to draw up the documents and go murim been 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:56.960
 put came the car goes well problems 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:06:01.639
 as it did not have with him so the price 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:02.740
 he gave us the last price for 4000 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:05.900
 gross 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:09.650
 Well now, in principle, here are the guys will issue 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:11.660
 him until the end she will go on the trawl not by 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.610
 name will go on their own 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:16.669
 because they sit down a truck 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:19.160
 bought here to arrange documents for the trawl 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:22.130
 so she came well and that's it 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:25.310
 subscribe to the channel for new meetings 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:28.490
 I do not know, we will not release the video yet 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:31.870
 because the number 22 will leave in 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:35.300
 St. Petersburg to visit his family and then 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:38.389
 I want to go to Kaliningrad only 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:40.280
 mid-june maybe something I'll take off well 

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:42.820
 let's see we will not all guess 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.820
 good luck
