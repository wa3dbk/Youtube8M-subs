00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.700
 in the novelty the journalists were mobilized village presents 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.500
 every week a brand new model that has appeared on the 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.529
 market this week it is the citroen c3 didier de radiguès him 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.550
 contrasts the old model of c3 to what extent the model is identical 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.550
 to the years 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.239
 Holland 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:32.999
 so tell me who falls on the citroën c3 

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:35.929
 but it's the second generation of c3 that will replace first that is 

00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:39.329
 appeared over eight years ago now that I'm starting to really tired 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.040
 in the very very competitive sector since 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.990
 hilale new polo but his arrival the ford fiesta which is very strong so 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.380
 it's heavy here the news of haifa it was time she arrived she is 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.370
 there today with sound equipment yes yes we actually have a lot 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.220
 more modern the global style is pretty much the same one teaches me served the 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.070
 very round roof arches that evokes for some I would say the mythical of 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.409
 horses but far the concept is not far at all 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:05.089
 my job it's with a beltline for honduras have been 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.869
 given in the light of dynamism to the car the abandonment so far the 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.270
 previous step the narrow narrow 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.290
 yet this one does to impose his biggest style she has a little bit 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.390
 longer than 10 cents more in length just a little bit wider 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.000
 but it stays below the 4 meter mark 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.360
 allows to continue to go to consider how 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.710
 a small versatile looks very practical and well posed on the road 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.260
 alas more room in the fourth in made not so much done that 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.970
 it's a bit of a shame, it's about the same as 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.770
 in the press and in the cei in the third the last 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.670
 a little space actually rear passenger level the trunk volume 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.770
 the doorman in Nantes we can regret also it is not necessary really 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:43.610
 modular 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.880
 we can see that we can fold the seat backs but we do not mark 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.320
 not the possibility of getting a floor plan 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.340
 a bed of rockets against his territory 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.090
 it might be better to show even faster and more convenient for 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.470
 next time to ban it 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.049
 qualiac far from the deutsche bank 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.110
 gold they actually and even compared to March and previous three 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.430
 citroën made progress the normans perceived quality in finishing 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.069
 renshaw to materials we really have the insurer 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.909
 their present of a car I would say quite upscale when we see 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:15.520
 it is now well addressed it is well designed at the level 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.629
 beyond people are lying too since we see it they forced and here 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:22.650
 in the street to allow passengers to advance as much as possible 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.149
 the day when to free from bel-air place him 

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:27.230
 why not add a car 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.020
 quite cleverly designed interesting sports project 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.990
 see this poster for this new edition drink piano like this for 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.529
 the good of a country at war over bring them together 

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:40.029
 and most of all they dropped the digital meters to return 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:41.619
 to accounts 

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:45.879
 in analog e I would say much more readable in my opinion than before 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:49.189
 from there a last of the ursid reflections wearing helmet called 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:51.009
 floating and sydney that is a little 

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:54.449
 laurent package in any case very effective we also note the dish here 

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:58.269
 very violent for the little sports story actually good time for 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.889
 age is not really a car extremely admits he's dancing in 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:02.980
 its interior design 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.010
 little nod to allah's socks whether it's sales not 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.230
 to be a sunroof anyway that's what this panoramic windshield in all 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.840
 case that required in the light in the sky the sky actually had them 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.989
 to this further inspired by what is done in the 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.180
 the segment of minivans i also think that picasso at grand c4 picasso 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.330
 simple who had ushered in this system good unfortunately while a few 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.519
 doubts about the durability of this system 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.989
 of sunscreen I do not crack more than the sides fast enough for this 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:31.979
 waiting 

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:33.290
 Yes 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.920
 a veritable verdonck echo both inside and out but 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.920
 what about the driving benefits of the c3 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:51.620
 attention slips it was also a road behavior that we 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.799
 do not know what has already parmalat 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:57.730
 Citroën conformed in time to a citroën be comfortable between May 6 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.370
 necessarily suspensions sometimes a little flexible at the expense of a dynamic 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.480
 of conduct that we like what we do a little bit our environment on the 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.790
 heart I do not know what is asked of her so she is comfortable and 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.629
 so the plain mans in agreement I would say with the vocation of this chrono him 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:14.569
 give motor level what do we do belgium that has only one hundred 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:17.370
 the diesel knows anyway that it is able to accommodate all things that 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.590
 make a name that targets small diesel engines extremely powerful the little 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.030
 14 150 horses 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.850
 for this as a percentage of the innovative horses what it was 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.850
 interesting to know as dry 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.100
 the bigger of the two of his ashes the more expensive 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.080
 and better to clean up 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.189
 donations that receive bonuses 

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:33.370
 the government 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.729
 more advantageous that make it into party 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:40.180
 yes 120 euros cheaper than the little bit for this Austro-Hungarian empire 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.490
 as serge aurier 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.400
 Prices start in May around 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.849
 and 14000 euros for the big and 14000 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:49.849
 wissant for the little paradoxical door 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:58.499
 the price of citroen c3 that we are testing today it 

00:04:58.499 --> 00:05:01.499
 amounts to at least 18000 from 149 euros in the wake 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.080
 when its engine per liter 6 diesel consumes only 3 of 10 8 liters to 100 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.580
 km it rejects that non-ensilage grams of six at the beginning km you 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.479
 get the bonus and government troops 15% tax from 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:17.250
 annual rolling of these cars which amounts to 243 0 67% 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:27.719
 you know we can say that it is a clear progression for the waters in 

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:29.979
 many areas fectively start with the Anglo-Norman style 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:32.830
 will be present in a car extremely worked on the plane of 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:33.389
 style 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:36.710
 who does not deny all the more qualities of a citroen that is expected 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.340
 generally that is to say comfort here comfort is one year up 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.870
 is now the quality of manufacture the finish the choice of 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.590
 materials that strikes hard so for those who may find a pole 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.129
 where the fiesta too wise 

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:49.060
 for me that's how we all did it
