but<00:00:12.860> the<00:00:13.860> team<00:00:14.130> I<00:00:14.160> chose<00:00:14.820> to<00:00:15.150> go<00:00:15.299> with<00:00:15.330> in<00:00:16.289> this

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
but the team I chose to go with in this

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.170 
but the team I chose to go with in this
series<00:00:16.650> is<00:00:17.070> Newcastle<00:00:17.730> because<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:17.970> believe

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
series is Newcastle because I believe

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.750 
series is Newcastle because I believe
they've<00:00:18.300> got<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.480> good<00:00:18.720> balance<00:00:19.289> between<00:00:19.760> funds

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
they've got a good balance between funds

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.810 
they've got a good balance between funds
and<00:00:21.150> talent<00:00:22.020> in<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.230> team<00:00:22.580> because<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:23.730> was

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
and talent in the team because I was

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.460 
and talent in the team because I was
thinking<00:00:24.119> if<00:00:24.269> I<00:00:24.359> went<00:00:24.510> with<00:00:24.600> one<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.170> top

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
thinking if I went with one of the top

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.000 
thinking if I went with one of the top
clubs<00:00:25.740> in<00:00:25.920> England<00:00:26.779> it'll<00:00:27.779> be<00:00:27.990> too<00:00:28.800> easy

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
clubs in England it'll be too easy

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.400 
clubs in England it'll be too easy
orbitals<00:00:29.880> by<00:00:30.090> any<00:00:30.240> player<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:31.109> wouldn't<00:00:31.380> be

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
orbitals by any player it wouldn't be

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.830 
orbitals by any player it wouldn't be
realistic<00:00:31.650> whereas<00:00:32.399> with<00:00:32.430> Newcastle<00:00:33.239> there's

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
realistic whereas with Newcastle there's

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.020 
realistic whereas with Newcastle there's
a<00:00:33.960> limitation<00:00:34.350> on<00:00:34.620> funds<00:00:34.950> so<00:00:35.160> i<00:00:35.370> have<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.850> think

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
a limitation on funds so i have to think

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.510 
a limitation on funds so i have to think
about<00:00:36.149> what<00:00:36.390> plays<00:00:36.570> are<00:00:36.600> Bible<00:00:37.110> so<00:00:37.290> I've<00:00:37.739> not

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
about what plays are Bible so I've not

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.910 
about what plays are Bible so I've not
got<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.730> best<00:00:38.879> squad<00:00:39.180> straightaway<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:40.559> I'll

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
got the best squad straightaway so I'll

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.119 
got the best squad straightaway so I'll
have<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.160> work<00:00:41.430> on<00:00:41.610> as<00:00:41.820> well<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.180> went<00:00:42.930> with<00:00:43.170> the

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
have to work on as well I went with the

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.610 
have to work on as well I went with the
difficulty<00:00:44.579> was<00:00:45.149> world<00:00:45.629> class<00:00:45.899> because<00:00:46.559> I

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
difficulty was world class because I

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.690 
difficulty was world class because I
believe<00:00:47.149> it's<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:49.050> moat<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:50.160> fair<00:00:50.670> is

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
believe it's the moat the fair is

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.150 
believe it's the moat the fair is
difficult<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.360> think<00:00:51.390> for<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:52.469> challenging

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
difficult I think for a challenging

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.979 
difficult I think for a challenging
myself<00:00:53.460> because<00:00:54.059> if<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:54.270> went<00:00:54.420> for<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.660> lower<00:00:54.780> the

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
myself because if I went for a lower the

could<00:02:00.780> be<00:02:01.009> then<00:02:02.009> after<00:02:02.700> my<00:02:02.820> first<00:02:03.030> season<00:02:03.659> if<00:02:03.869> I

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
could be then after my first season if I

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.050 
could be then after my first season if I
buns<00:02:04.200> that<00:02:04.409> well<00:02:04.770> or<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:05.549> could<00:02:05.670> be<00:02:05.700> after<00:02:05.969> my

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060

second season hopefully you'll be my
first<00:02:07.200> season<00:02:07.590> so<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.640> longevity<00:02:08.849> of<00:02:09.239> the

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
first season so the longevity of the

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.610 
first season so the longevity of the
series<00:02:09.690> doesn't<00:02:09.869> go<00:02:10.020> on<00:02:10.140> for<00:02:10.289> ages<00:02:10.470> but

series doesn't go on for ages but

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.000 
series doesn't go on for ages but
if<00:02:12.799> it<00:02:13.250> is<00:02:13.720> often<00:02:14.720> a<00:02:14.930> second<00:02:15.230> season<00:02:15.379> a<00:02:15.620> master

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
if it is often a second season a master
