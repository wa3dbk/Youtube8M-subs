00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
the right if I were to use it like an

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.499 
the right if I were to use it like an
actual<00:01:41.280> Mouse<00:01:41.840> make<00:01:42.840> search<00:01:44.149> as<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.329> see

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
there the red light and that can be

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.990 
there the red light and that can be
really<00:01:48.540> like<00:01:48.840> bad<00:01:49.320> for<00:01:49.590> some<00:01:49.770> people<00:01:50.070> because

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
really like bad for some people because

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.319 
really like bad for some people because
just<00:01:51.630> people<00:01:51.930> don't<00:01:52.079> really<00:01:52.200> like<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.710> and

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
just people don't really like it and

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:56.090 
just people don't really like it and
it's<00:01:54.329> just<00:01:54.450> not<00:01:55.020> really<00:01:55.229> ideal<00:01:55.560> for<00:01:55.860> some

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
it's just not really ideal for some

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.760 
it's just not really ideal for some
people<00:01:56.960> personally<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:58.110> think<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.619> looks

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
people personally I think it looks

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.469 
people personally I think it looks
pretty<00:01:58.950> unique<00:02:00.049> so<00:02:01.880> but<00:02:02.880> that<00:02:03.030> is<00:02:03.180> just<00:02:03.299> my

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
pretty unique so but that is just my

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.249 
pretty unique so but that is just my
opinion<00:02:03.630> so<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.939> also<00:02:05.939> it<00:02:06.570> doesn't<00:02:07.020> have<00:02:07.140> the

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
opinion so and also it doesn't have the

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.169 
opinion so and also it doesn't have the
Apple<00:02:07.680> logo<00:02:07.860> there<00:02:08.280> like<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.520> normal<00:02:08.910> Magic

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
Apple logo there like a normal Magic

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.030 
Apple logo there like a normal Magic
Mouse<00:02:09.330> would<00:02:09.569> but<00:02:09.780> this<00:02:09.989> isn't<00:02:10.259> Magic<00:02:10.739> Mouse

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.160 

but<00:02:13.430> for<00:02:13.610> any<00:02:13.730> windows<00:02:14.209> using<00:02:14.689> pretty<00:02:15.080> much

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
but for any windows using pretty much

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.559 
but for any windows using pretty much
