White<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.219> breaking<00:00:50.550> bad<00:00:50.730> but<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.090> course<00:00:51.329> they

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
White of breaking bad but of course they

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.689 
White of breaking bad but of course they
don't<00:00:52.079> have<00:00:52.320> like<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.559> license<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.280> do<00:00:53.520> that

don't have like a license to do that
kind<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:53.969> stuff<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.210> they<00:00:54.449> called<00:00:54.750> him<00:00:55.020> the

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
kind of stuff so they called him the

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.330 
kind of stuff so they called him the
chemistry<00:00:56.090> enthusiast<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.920> they<00:00:58.920> sold<00:00:59.250> them

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
chemistry enthusiast and they sold them

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.430 
chemistry enthusiast and they sold them
for<00:00:59.370> eighteen<00:01:00.000> dollars<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.140> currently

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
for eighteen dollars and it is currently

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.020 
for eighteen dollars and it is currently
sold<00:01:01.710> out<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.190> it's<00:01:02.280> been<00:01:02.430> sold<00:01:02.670> out<00:01:02.760> for<00:01:02.820> a

sold out and it's been sold out for a
while<00:01:03.270> because<00:01:03.899> i<00:01:04.110> believe<00:01:04.409> they<00:01:04.619> had<00:01:04.799> a

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
while because i believe they had a

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.480 
while because i believe they had a
limited<00:01:05.129> run<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.580> about<00:01:06.030> 400<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:07.830> these<00:01:08.130> were

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
limited run of about 400 of these were

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.700 
limited run of about 400 of these were
made<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.080> they<00:01:10.080> saw<00:01:10.260> him<00:01:10.350> for<00:01:10.470> 18<00:01:10.560> bucks

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
made and they saw him for 18 bucks

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.320 
made and they saw him for 18 bucks
apiece<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.580> don't<00:01:11.760> be<00:01:11.850> quite<00:01:12.090> difficult

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
apiece and you don't be quite difficult

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.770 
apiece and you don't be quite difficult
to<00:01:12.600> get<00:01:12.869> them<00:01:13.049> now<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.880> chemistry

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
to get them now so the chemistry

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.960 
to get them now so the chemistry
enthusiasts<00:01:16.470> obviously<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.159> based<00:01:17.369> on<00:01:17.520> Walter

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
enthusiasts obviously is based on Walter

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.359 
enthusiasts obviously is based on Walter
White<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.479> he<00:01:18.720> comes<00:01:18.990> with<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.470> good<00:01:20.220> old

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
White and he comes with a good old

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.820 
White and he comes with a good old
science<00:01:20.820> class<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.750> clear<00:01:22.320> transparent

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
science class and to clear transparent

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.330 
science class and to clear transparent
blue<00:01:23.400> pieces<00:01:23.700> which<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.299> course<00:01:24.330> are<00:01:25.340> Walter

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
blue pieces which of course are Walter

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.480 
blue pieces which of course are Walter
White's<00:01:26.549> signature<00:01:27.210> meth<00:01:27.890> so<00:01:28.890> when<00:01:29.100> we<00:01:29.220> turn

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
White's signature meth so when we turn

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.359 
White's signature meth so when we turn
this<00:01:29.700> over<00:01:29.970> on<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.840> back<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.470> we<00:01:31.920> can<00:01:31.950> take<00:01:32.340> a

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
this over on the back and we can take a

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.510 
this over on the back and we can take a
look<00:01:32.670> at<00:01:33.530> some<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.740> back<00:01:34.920> printing<00:01:35.369> on

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
look at some of the back printing on

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.550 
look at some of the back printing on
this<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.060> read<00:01:36.540> some<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.259> things<00:01:37.439> that

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
this and read some of the things that

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.600 
this and read some of the things that
they<00:01:37.740> want<00:01:37.979> us<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:39.210> see<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:40.159> like<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.280> just<00:01:41.340> said

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
they want us to see and like I just said

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.560 
they want us to see and like I just said
it<00:01:41.790> says<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.150> they<00:01:42.270> use<00:01:43.909> genuine<00:01:44.909> Lego<00:01:45.210> parts

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
it says that they use genuine Lego parts

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.219 
it says that they use genuine Lego parts
and<00:01:45.960> Lego<00:01:46.140> compatible<00:01:46.890> parts<00:01:47.390> so<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.720> is

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
and Lego compatible parts so that is

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.190 
and Lego compatible parts so that is
very<00:01:49.320> cool<00:01:49.770> bettors<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.460> figure<00:01:50.909> there<00:01:51.270> but

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
very cool bettors the figure there but

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.469 
very cool bettors the figure there but
let's<00:01:53.159> not<00:01:53.220> take<00:01:53.490> him<00:01:53.729> out<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.060> package

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
let's not take him out of the package

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.899 
let's not take him out of the package
let's<00:01:54.960> bring<00:01:55.229> in<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.560> real<00:01:55.740> thing<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.130> here

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
let's bring in the real thing and here

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.910 
let's bring in the real thing and here
he<00:01:57.000> is<00:01:57.030> this<00:01:57.450> is<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.780> chemistry<00:01:58.170> enthusiast

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
he is this is the chemistry enthusiast

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.190 
he is this is the chemistry enthusiast
this<00:01:59.189> is<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.670> not<00:02:00.090> Walter<00:02:00.630> White<00:02:00.869> but<00:02:01.140> he

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
this is the not Walter White but he

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.649 
this is the not Walter White but he
obviously<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.860> Walter<00:02:02.430> White<00:02:02.670> minifigure<00:02:03.420> and

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
obviously is Walter White minifigure and

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.690 
obviously is Walter White minifigure and
he<00:02:04.500> is<00:02:04.710> wearing

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
he is wearing
