00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
now it's ticking me off their run still

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.870 
now it's ticking me off their run still
in<00:05:41.710> the<00:05:41.800> game<00:05:41.980> on<00:05:42.280> the<00:05:42.310> phone<00:05:43.350> at<00:05:44.350> home<00:05:44.590> so<00:05:45.040> what

in the game on the phone at home so what
was<00:05:46.030> really<00:05:46.240> hoping<00:05:46.600> to<00:05:46.690> be<00:05:46.810> able<00:05:46.840> to<00:05:47.080> do<00:05:47.200> is

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:47.320 
was really hoping to be able to do is

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.560 
was really hoping to be able to do is

once the PlayStation mobile came out to

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.590 
once the PlayStation mobile came out to
the<00:05:49.690> 1-series<00:05:50.260> loans<00:05:50.680> to<00:05:51.520> be<00:05:51.610> able<00:05:51.850> to<00:05:51.970> open<00:05:52.480> up

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 
the 1-series loans to be able to open up

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.380 
the 1-series loans to be able to open up
a<00:05:52.690> game<00:05:52.900> on<00:05:53.080> the<00:05:53.110> phone<00:05:53.470> slide<00:05:54.460> 3<00:05:54.670> fingers<00:05:54.940> up

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:55.390 
a game on the phone slide 3 fingers up

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:57.840 
a game on the phone slide 3 fingers up
transfer<00:05:56.050> the<00:05:56.080> screen<00:05:56.530> up<00:05:56.800> to<00:05:57.040> the<00:05:57.160> TV<00:05:57.430> and

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.010 
then hope that a PlayStation controller

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.760 
then hope that a PlayStation controller
would<00:06:00.280> show<00:06:00.550> up<00:06:00.730> on<00:06:00.880> the<00:06:01.180> phone<00:06:01.480> so<00:06:02.380> that<00:06:02.410> would

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:02.770 
would show up on the phone so that would

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.560 
would show up on the phone so that would
become<00:06:03.070> your<00:06:03.220> controller<00:06:03.610> I'm<00:06:03.940> really<00:06:04.300> open

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:04.570
