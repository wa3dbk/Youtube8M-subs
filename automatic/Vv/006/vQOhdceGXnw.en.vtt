on we come up here we'll check our

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.250 
on we come up here we'll check our
temperatures<00:03:40.610> my<00:03:41.610> temperatures<00:03:42.209> are<00:03:42.480> good<00:03:42.870> a

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
temperatures my temperatures are good a

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.770 
temperatures my temperatures are good a
good<00:03:44.130> rule<00:03:44.400> of<00:03:44.430> thumb<00:03:44.790> if<00:03:45.239> you<00:03:45.450> can<00:03:45.630> lay<00:03:45.750> your

good rule of thumb if you can lay your

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.530 
good rule of thumb if you can lay your
hand<00:03:46.170> on<00:03:46.350> there<00:03:47.090> you're<00:03:48.090> in<00:03:48.239> pretty<00:03:48.450> good

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
hand on there you're in pretty good

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.699 
hand on there you're in pretty good
shape<00:03:48.720> temperature-wise

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
shape temperature-wise

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.820 
shape temperature-wise
it's<00:03:50.220> not<00:03:50.519> too<00:03:50.820> hot<00:03:51.120> so<00:03:51.600> we've<00:03:52.380> been<00:03:52.530> here

let's<00:04:00.810> just<00:04:01.049> air<00:04:01.410> this<00:04:01.620> grain<00:04:01.980> up<00:04:02.250> a<00:04:02.370> little

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
let's just air this grain up a little

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.449 
let's just air this grain up a little
bit<00:04:02.790> get<00:04:03.510> a<00:04:03.540> nice<00:04:03.780> even<00:04:04.110> smoke<00:04:04.799> on<00:04:05.040> everything

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
bit get a nice even smoke on everything

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.309 
bit get a nice even smoke on everything
the<00:04:05.610> grain<00:04:05.910> is<00:04:06.209> actually

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
the grain is actually

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.890 
the grain is actually
cool<00:04:08.450> so<00:04:09.450> we<00:04:09.599> know<00:04:09.749> we're<00:04:09.930> in<00:04:10.049> good<00:04:10.200> shape<00:04:10.260> here

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
cool so we know we're in good shape here

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.199 
cool so we know we're in good shape here
you<00:04:12.900> can<00:04:13.049> see<00:04:13.230> again<00:04:13.530> I've<00:04:13.709> got<00:04:13.859> it<00:04:13.950> raised<00:04:14.209> off

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
you can see again I've got it raised off

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.240 
you can see again I've got it raised off
the<00:04:15.269> great<00:04:15.719> just<00:04:16.079> in<00:04:16.229> case<00:04:16.470> this<00:04:16.709> gets<00:04:16.919> hot

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
the great just in case this gets hot

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.189 
the great just in case this gets hot
which<00:04:17.549> again<00:04:17.850> I<00:04:17.910> can<00:04:18.209> put<00:04:18.389> my<00:04:18.509> fingers<00:04:18.870> on<00:04:19.019> it

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 
which again I can put my fingers on it

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.069 
which again I can put my fingers on it
so<00:04:19.410> we're<00:04:20.340> not<00:04:20.370> too<00:04:20.789> hot<00:04:21.030> things<00:04:21.600> are<00:04:21.810> going
