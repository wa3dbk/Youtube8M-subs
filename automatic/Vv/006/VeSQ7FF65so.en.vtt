00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.350
 Mayweather against took away really 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.880
 action movie 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:14.019
 home of the 21st century smarter than him either and 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.779
 more interesting 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:19.180
 combat revenue will exceed 400 million 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:21.189
 dollars is it time to stay with me 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.259
 unfortunately nothing will come from them 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:26.529
 I don't know if they added to me 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:28.689
 I got it would be so happy Jick Jick and 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.520
 I still think it 's time for me 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.880
 stop not only in boxing at all in 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.859
 sports and show business in general 150 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.129
 million Mayweather and stop at yale 

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:41.920
 fair relationship but that's their business 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:44.739
 in my opinion fairer fell 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.750
 equal by 50 percent but what are the prices 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.239
 what kind of money is it but we ourselves 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.129
 it is your fault yes we are in it now 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.649
 on the canyon 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.570
 he does n't have a single lesion somehow 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:58.120
 become taller therefore he should 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.940
 get immediately and a half more it 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.039
 fair distribution 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.040
 is this your one hundred percent or 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:08.259
 you are still in doubt but no longer aki 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.920
 nuclear war suddenly happens or if 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:13.799
 someone gets hurt 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.960
 Mayweather or under you I am cooler 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:21.520
 ring showing in my opinion my this 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:24.880
 all the same all the same what is in common between them 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.250
 nothing completely different people here are just 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.490
 in human terms and boxer 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.549
 completely different to mere mortal 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.360
 really get on it your not 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.869
 perfectly 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:42.219
 for not very tickets here in good places 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:44.229
 these are thousands and thousands there and the Moors first 

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:48.609
 rows to this tens of thousands of dollars 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:52.090
 very hard so 65,000 dollars for a ticket 

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:52.869
 and too cool for a pontey warrior more expensive 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.149
 of money 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.369
 I basically would not flesh here 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:00.250
 were full money such never became 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:02.759
 somehow earlier these stars gave places 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.560
 cinema and show business 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:09.130
 were given for free but then they are 65 a 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.929
 may leave more casino as much 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.890
 would you be willing to spend to 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:19.780
 see this fight live it in our 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:22.120
 hard times of crisis you don't know 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.160
 but 1000 dollars would pay the numbers that 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.090
 I don't even have that much money 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.420
 i could spend 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.130
 I would be much more interested in our 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.460
 the channel bought it all the same fail or 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.520
 work on this duel 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:39.550
 you vegas is the perfect place for battle 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:42.280
 yes certainly not perfect 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:46.090
 happens to some other sports 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:49.660
 the event is comparable to the upcoming fight well 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:52.510
 probably with the final hockey olympiads and 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.170
 hockey world cup i'm so far 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.470
 from other sports not 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.780
 you grab the roof what should 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.239
 happen that you do not watch this 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:06.160
 fight on my head fell brick 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.160
 even scary to imagine
