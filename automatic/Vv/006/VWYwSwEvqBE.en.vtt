00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.970
 here work closely with the start number 38 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.250
 proud as he wrote all alone in the basin 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.250
 essentially weavers 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.860

 this is currently in the position in the race 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:58.989
 After position fight on which conditions around 11 we may be missing 

00:03:23.429 --> 00:03:26.899
 but with the quake that day in the form of his life 

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:30.279
