audience it's the level before floodgate
I<00:00:40.020> think<00:00:40.379> it's<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.800> first<00:00:41.100> router<00:00:41.820> checkpoint

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
I think it's the first router checkpoint

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.540 
I think it's the first router checkpoint
is<00:00:43.379> where<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.800> get<00:00:43.920> out<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.190> this<00:00:44.460> is

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
is where you get out of that this is

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.040 
is where you get out of that this is
we're<00:00:44.700> gonna<00:00:44.789> go<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.149> map<00:00:45.300> wait<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:45.840> know

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
we're gonna go to the map wait I know

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.160 
we're gonna go to the map wait I know

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
this is you know where the scarabs at

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.790 
this is you know where the scarabs at
the<00:00:53.940> first<00:00:54.149> checkpoint<00:00:54.410> you<00:00:55.410> don't<00:00:55.590> have<00:00:55.710> to

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
the first checkpoint you don't have to

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.279 
the first checkpoint you don't have to
kill<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.039> Scarab<00:00:56.570> you<00:00:57.570> basically<00:00:57.899> come<00:00:58.109> over
