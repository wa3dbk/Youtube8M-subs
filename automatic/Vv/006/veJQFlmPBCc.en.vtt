00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.990
 Hello everyone, once again let us down 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.250
 the outcome of the action this time the action was on 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.559
 doctor strange 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.450
 and the three stars occupied nine nine hundred 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.920
 seventy first place got your 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.890
 strange and two crystals 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.170
 on 4 stars behind them you are the fifth figure 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.689
 place as well as last time especially 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.410
 did not strain scored about 800 thousand 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.449
 points and further did not begin to play also 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.520
 let's start discovering our crystals 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.640
 accumulated a lot of crystals in 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.680
 particulars there is a wizard crystal in it 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.070
 supposedly there is a doctor strange let's 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.579
 time and see if he's here while i'm his 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.579
 I do not see 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:51.989
 star year was captain marvel raccoon 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.769
 was a four star doctor 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:59.359
 strange is not seen who is interesting 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:59.359
 the thread won him out of this crystal 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.839
 obviously not we again up to star top 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.180
 already the seventh 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.460
 once again convinced that the meaning of 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.289
 These crystals are not about what a crystal is. 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.750
 brutality that crystal science what 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:30.850
 wizard crystal nothing sensible from 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.689
 they did not fall out although worth decent 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.970
 money that I think no longer will they 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:39.280
 buy these crystals ball save up for 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.710
 four-star sheets also have 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:46.149
 there is a huge amount of 2 4 star 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:48.340
 crystals as many as 14 let's hope that 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:55.060
 win something worthwhile also open 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:57.420
 button so what we see yes there is a whole 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.399
 one three star captain america 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.729
 but the principle is not bad considering that 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:05.200
 boars here cheated in these crystals 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.920
 at least one three-star 10 crystals 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.829
 for me it is not bad yes it is the first dubai 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.780
 captain america at 3 stars 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:16.019
 so open ability on step 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.019
 backwards 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.209
 also we have 4 more left 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:30.730
 crystal buy action again 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:35.390
 I will not spend 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:40.209
 I will save take these messages and 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:42.890
 open 4 more crystals so what we see 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:46.790
 three star again and again captain 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:50.560
 America lucky us today railing 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:54.049
 ability will be on level 16 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.950
 I think in principle, not bad before 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:03:00.400
 It could be worse 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.400
 also we have 7 union crystals 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.900
 who will open the button to not lose 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:11.100
 time and once again was a star 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:13.260
 the irresistible colossus we see that his crown 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:17.160
 increases by as much as two points 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.560
 it's pretty cool interesting on three 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.390
 stars she will increase plus 16 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.000
 if someone knows then write in 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.980
 comments on this and 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.530
 let's look at our doctor 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:35.150
 Stefan Strange we read his biography 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.150
 and look at his abilities 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:43.010

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.010
 all tina and prestige 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:50.069
 in also quite interesting abilities 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.180
 I think it will be pretty strong 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.920
 interesting character 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.810
 communicate this is his one of the most 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.540
 interesting characters in the universe 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.700
 marvel looking forward to the movie 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.790

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.790
 phase 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.490
 so quite a lot of bonuses with energy and 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.710
