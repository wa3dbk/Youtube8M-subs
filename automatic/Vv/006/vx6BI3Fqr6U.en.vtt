Flake White, is a warm white pigment that
is completely opaque and permanent. It dries

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.230
quickly, maintains a fresh appearance, and
mixes well due to it’s low tinting strength.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.630
The fine brushing and mixing qualities of
Flake White make it a favourite among oil

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.610
painters, notably the late Lucian Freud.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.900
It’s also called Snowflake White or White
Lead.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.400
Yup, this very attractive white is a synthetic
inorganic pigment derived from lead.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.809
While we know very well today lead is poisonous,
and not good for our body, flake white has

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.799
a surprisingly long history despite these
health hazards.

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:42.319
Composed of basic lead carbonate with zinc
oxide, it’s considered one of the oldest

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:48.569
pigments. It was used as a cosmetic in 400
BC Athens. It was used by Ancient Egyptians

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:51.389
and in the earliest Chinese Paintings.

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:56.600
Traditionally, Flake White is created by the
stack process. They have hundreds or thousands

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.010
of earthenware pots containing vinegar and
lead.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.680
The pots were designed so that the vinegar
and lead was separated, but the vapor of the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.409
vinegar would reach the lead.

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.049
The pots were covered loosely with a grid
of lead, which allowed carbon dioxide to circulate

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:13.049
in the pot. The pots were stacked on top of
each other, with a layer of tan bark or cow

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.630
feces in between.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.909
They were left for about a month to ferment,
and the lead gets covered with a crust of

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:26.049
rust that is white lead. The rust is separated
from the lead, washed and ground into a pigment.

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:32.700
Venetian Ceruse, also called Spirits of Saturn,
was basically Flake White used as a cosmetic

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.929
instead of paint, (But I guess, painting your
face instead of painting a canvas) and was

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:40.640
used during the 16th century as a cosmetic
skin whitener.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.539
At the time, it was in fashion to have really
pale skin, so this powder was really popular

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:48.270
and it was in great demand.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.119
However, since it was basically putting lead
directly on your face, it was very bad for

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.950
your skin. There’s a lot of bad things associated
with lead poisoning, but using it as a cosmetic

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:06.240
on your skin, it will actually cause scarring.
And the women would pile on even more to cover

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.720
up the scarring, and it was just this very
vicious cycle.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.019
Plus, since it was directly on their skin,
it would be easily absorbed and caused lead

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:21.190
poisoning. And this is associated with a bunch
of horrible things like nervous system damage,

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:28.170
stunted growth, delayed development, kidney
damage, hair loss, and over an extended period

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.019
of time, could lead to death.

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.930
So be very careful with lead. Anyways, back
to painting!

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.920
As I said, flake white was extremely popular
for painting. And part of it was due to the

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.959
fact that there weren’t really any other
whites that were really easily accessible,

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.950
until the 19th century when other white paints
began to pop up.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.870
Flake White also has a lot of attributes,
as I said before. But just to add to the list,

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:00.629
it was durable, moisture resistant, and flexible.
Basically, it lasted a really long time. It

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:05.840
was sometimes painted as a base layer because
its flexibility actually made the paints on

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.670
top last longer, and it helped preserve the
paints.

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:15.549
Now, I think i’ve made it pretty clear that
lead is toxic, as if you didn’t know already.

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:20.629
So if you are working with this color, make
sure to not ingest any. With proper precautions,

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:26.269
it can be perfectly safe to use in small quantities.
But if you’re a painter, I definitely recommend

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:31.219
for you to read the Safety Materials provided
with your paints. Probably for all your paints

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:37.049
in general, which can be found online. I’ll
leave a blog post down below which talks about

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:37.629
this.

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:42.799
If you’re still concerned, consider substituting
it with another white. Flake White Hue is

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:46.920
a very similar alternative, but skips the
whole lead part.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.349
There’s also titanium white and zinc white.
They’re also usually cheaper because safety

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:56.099
regulations has increased the price of flake
white.

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:02.040
Titanium white has a stronger tinting strength,
so use it in smaller quantities. Zinc white

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.530
a little bit less opaque and a little bit
more transparent, so it’s great for mixing

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.549
more subtle colors while maintaining transparency.

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:14.680
I hope you guys enjoyed this video about the
dark history of flake white. Thanks so much

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.480
to the person who suggested this topic. I
hope it lived up to you expectations. If you

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.030
want to see more videos about the history
of colors, I’ll link a playlist down in

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.950
the description below.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.660
Thanks so much for watching and I’ll see
you guys next time.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.220
Flake white… Hrm why is there a fuzz?
