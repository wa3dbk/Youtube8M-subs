00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.019 

if<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.839> fail<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.380> draw<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.829> line<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.489> probably

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
if I fail to draw a line I probably

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:43.510 
if I fail to draw a line I probably
don't<00:00:32.449> Guild<00:00:33.449> nation<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.989> apply<00:00:34.199> segment

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.960 

there's<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.640> land<00:00:44.970> but<00:00:46.310> comes<00:00:47.310> the<00:00:47.490> cost<00:00:47.730> of

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:47.970 
there's a land but comes the cost of

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.690 
there's a land but comes the cost of
three<00:00:48.540> drop<00:00:48.750> for<00:00:48.990> me<00:00:49.080> I<00:00:49.910> guess<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:52.550> still<00:00:53.550> do

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:53.700 
three drop for me I guess I still do

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.960 
three drop for me I guess I still do
this<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.810> chances<00:00:55.170> he<00:00:55.200> is<00:00:55.380> a<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.590> drop

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:55.970 
this the chances he is a to drop

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.300 
this the chances he is a to drop
relatively<00:00:56.970> low<00:00:57.150> and<00:00:57.800> so<00:00:58.800> it's<00:00:58.890> about<00:00:59.130> the

00:00:59.300 --> 00:00:59.310 
relatively low and so it's about the

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.910 
relatively low and so it's about the
same<00:00:59.430> amount<00:00:59.490> of<00:00:59.790> damage<00:01:00.560> something<00:01:01.560> he<00:01:01.680> can't

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
same amount of damage something he can't

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.770 
same amount of damage something he can't
block<00:01:02.130> a<00:01:02.160> scout<00:01:02.490> plus<00:01:02.910> if<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.210> draw<00:01:03.420> an<00:01:03.480> island

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
block a scout plus if I draw an island

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:12.650 
block a scout plus if I draw an island
off<00:01:03.900> the<00:01:03.930> top<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.320> this<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.589> awesome<00:01:11.660> wrecking

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.080 

you'll<00:01:19.680> save<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:22.250> wrecking<00:01:23.250> ball<00:01:23.310> lands<00:01:23.790> twice
