relying<00:03:47.400> solely<00:03:47.670> on<00:03:47.850> computers<00:03:48.480> and<00:03:48.720> we

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
relying solely on computers and we

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.220 
relying solely on computers and we
certainly<00:03:49.530> weren't<00:03:49.829> relying<00:03:50.160> solely<00:03:50.430> on<00:03:50.579> CGI

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
so really what toy story did is it

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.199 
so really what toy story did is it
created<00:03:54.600> an<00:03:54.720> environment<00:03:54.900> in<00:03:55.470> which<00:03:55.530> a
