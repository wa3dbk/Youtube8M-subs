00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.819
 once we are on the page 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.880
 wordpress in Spanish download the 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.420
 latest version 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.970
 we unzip them inside the directory 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.800
 ht docs of sham 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.800
 we touch extract here 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.130
 well we have unpacked the 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.019
 wordpress folder what we have to 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.900
 to do is enter the directory of 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:31.060
 wordpress we select all the 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.720
 files and we are in windows we do it 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:37.570
 with controls 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:40.570
 with control x we ​​cut 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:44.550
 we go back in the browser and with 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.550
 Cutting control we paste 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:59.809
 we look for the file that says w with fix 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.809
 sample php we open it with an editor 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.199
 we look for the chain where the name says 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.210
 from your database 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:11.869
 we place tests 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:15.690
 username we put root because 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:19.290
 We are in a local facility 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.540
 and in password we leave it blank 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.760
 this usually remains by default 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.380
 when we have a sham installation to 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.100
 which we do not place him neither user nor 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:32.490
 password with controls we keep the 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.960
 w file with fix sample 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.960
 we close the editor 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.380
 and now renamed 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:46.240
 We delete the file where the string 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.740
 join and leave the file with the 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.730
 name of w 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.730
 php 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.830
 we return to the browser 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:02.950
 we wrote localhost bar php by admin 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.340
 which it is the database administrator 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:10.390
 data once we're in php 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:13.060
 my admin touch the database button 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.460
 in creating new database we place 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.120
 tests 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.120
 create 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.689
 and we see a welcome screen where 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.300
 will ask us for the title of the site that 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:30.280
 we can add tests 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.620
 the username we can leave the 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.520
 less in password we can create a 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:39.700
 password that is called demos we repeat the 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.460
 password the system tells us what is 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.860
 a weak password if we were in 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.330
 an internet site that we rent we go to 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.970
 a good hosting here we will have to 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.880
 put a more robust key but for the 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.740
 practice is fine we place an email 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.590
 real electronic because that's where we 're going to 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.430
 send the password that we add here 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.109
 to wordpress 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.109
 then we place an email 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:11.590
 let's check the privacy box 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.810
 and we touch the install button 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.050
 we access 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.520
 we put again 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.210
 user 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:25.690
 the password that we said that was of 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.690
 we touch access 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.519
 we enter the dashboard or administrator 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.050
 from wordpress this means that the 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.239
 installation has been successful and that 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.010
 We could governments correctly if 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.950
 we want to test how the page looks 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:43.569
 main wordpress we can go 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.569
 directly to localhost
