okay<00:00:00.870> guys<00:00:01.050> back<00:00:01.319> again<00:00:02.600> as<00:00:03.600> I<00:00:03.840> said<00:00:03.899> I<00:00:04.080> was

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
okay guys back again as I said I was

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.980 
okay guys back again as I said I was
replacing<00:00:04.560> my<00:00:04.680> water<00:00:04.890> pump<00:00:05.480> last<00:00:06.480> night<00:00:06.779> I

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
replacing my water pump last night I

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.919 
replacing my water pump last night I
think<00:00:07.049> the<00:00:07.319> job<00:00:07.500> finished<00:00:08.450> the<00:00:09.450> life<00:00:09.690> that<00:00:09.870> I

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
think the job finished the life that I

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.570 
think the job finished the life that I
was<00:00:10.050> using<00:00:10.200> off<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.620> battery<00:00:11.040> flat<00:00:11.400> in<00:00:11.519> the

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
was using off the battery flat in the

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.089 
was using off the battery flat in the
battery<00:00:11.940> size<00:00:12.120> there's<00:00:12.660> no<00:00:12.750> big<00:00:12.929> problem<00:00:13.349> but

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
battery size there's no big problem but

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.709 
battery size there's no big problem but
just<00:00:14.639> want<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.030> show<00:00:15.179> you<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.299> couple<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.540> quick

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
just want to show you a couple of quick

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.609 
just want to show you a couple of quick
modifications<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:16.650> I've<00:00:16.890> done<00:00:17.420> to<00:00:18.420> make<00:00:18.630> life

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
modifications and I've done to make life

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.150 
modifications and I've done to make life
a<00:00:19.830> little<00:00:19.980> bit<00:00:20.160> simple<00:00:20.609> as<00:00:20.670> you<00:00:20.939> know<00:00:21.769> the<00:00:22.769> date

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
a little bit simple as you know the date

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.849 
a little bit simple as you know the date
datum<00:00:23.789> timing<00:00:24.269> mark<00:00:24.510> on<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.439> harmonic

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
datum timing mark on the harmonic

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.740 
datum timing mark on the harmonic
balance<00:00:26.930> when<00:00:27.930> you<00:00:28.080> try<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.349> set<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.680> timing

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
balance when you try to set the timing

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.430 
balance when you try to set the timing
the<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:31.199> mark<00:00:32.000> that's<00:00:33.000> on<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:34.140> cover

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
the the mark that's on the the cover

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.459 
the the mark that's on the the cover
here<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.370> timing<00:00:35.730> cover<00:00:36.110> it's<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.260> lot

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
here and the timing cover it's a lot

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.229 
here and the timing cover it's a lot
longer<00:00:37.649> this<00:00:38.160> little<00:00:38.399> section<00:00:38.579> here<00:00:38.760> is<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.030> lot

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
longer this little section here is a lot

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.299 
longer this little section here is a lot
longer<00:00:39.390> it's<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.780> about<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.200> far<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:41.160> your

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
longer it's it about that far so your

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.750 
longer it's it about that far so your
timing<00:00:41.550> mark<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:42.059> actually<00:00:42.390> underneath<00:00:43.760> the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
timing mark is actually underneath the

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.600 
timing mark is actually underneath the
piece<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.149> plastic<00:00:45.530> on<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.100> timing<00:00:47.460> cover

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
piece of plastic on the the timing cover

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.720 
piece of plastic on the the timing cover
which<00:00:48.539> makes<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:48.930> very<00:00:48.960> difficult<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:50.489> set

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
which makes it very difficult to to set

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.389 
which makes it very difficult to to set
your<00:00:50.910> timing<00:00:51.800> correctly<00:00:52.800> you're<00:00:53.039> really<00:00:53.309> the

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
your timing correctly you're really the

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.060 
your timing correctly you're really the
only<00:00:53.489> taking<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.030> guess<00:00:54.329> at<00:00:54.510> where<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:54.989> so<00:00:55.949> as

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
only taking a guess at where it is so as

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.350 
only taking a guess at where it is so as
you<00:00:56.219> can<00:00:56.309> see<00:00:56.370> what<00:00:56.670> I've<00:00:56.789> done

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
you can see what I've done

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.460 
you can see what I've done
I<00:00:59.510> cut<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.629> back<00:01:00.949> now<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:01.980> still<00:01:02.280> have<00:01:02.340> my<00:01:02.640> mark<00:01:02.879> I

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
I cut it back now I still have my mark I

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.170 
I cut it back now I still have my mark I
still<00:01:04.470> have<00:01:04.619> my<00:01:04.769> timing<00:01:05.159> mark<00:01:05.339> right<00:01:05.670> here

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
still have my timing mark right here

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.219 
still have my timing mark right here
I<00:01:06.350> haven't<00:01:07.350> lost<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:08.299> and<00:01:09.299> what<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.510> also<00:01:09.780> did

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
I haven't lost it and what I also did

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.770 
I haven't lost it and what I also did
was<00:01:11.390> a<00:01:12.390> painted<00:01:12.840> balance<00:01:13.729> and<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:15.180> as<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.630> can

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
was a painted balance and I as you can

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.870 
was a painted balance and I as you can
see<00:01:15.990> right<00:01:16.229> here<00:01:17.330> you<00:01:18.330> can<00:01:18.509> see<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.869> I've

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
see right here you can see it I've

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.899 
see right here you can see it I've
remarked<00:01:21.740> the<00:01:22.740> timing<00:01:23.159> mark<00:01:23.369> with<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.610> small

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
remarked the timing mark with a small

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.569 
remarked the timing mark with a small
farm<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:24.720> it's<00:01:25.439> very<00:01:25.799> very<00:01:26.189> obvious<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:26.880> now

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 
farm so it's very very obvious so now

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:34.910 
farm so it's very very obvious so now
when<00:01:29.579> you're<00:01:32.030> harmonic<00:01:33.030> balance<00:01:33.619> sits<00:01:34.619> in<00:01:34.799> the

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
when you're harmonic balance sits in the

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:42.620 
when you're harmonic balance sits in the
place<00:01:36.290> like<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:40.700> right<00:01:41.700> there<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.090> can<00:01:42.270> see

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
place like so right there you can see

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.670 
place like so right there you can see
how<00:01:43.049> well<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.890> easy<00:01:44.990> you<00:01:45.990> can<00:01:46.020> say<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.439> timing

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
how well and easy you can say the timing

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.130 
how well and easy you can say the timing
mark<00:01:47.090> you<00:01:48.090> can<00:01:48.180> have<00:01:48.329> no<00:01:48.540> problem<00:01:48.899> setting

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
mark you can have no problem setting

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.319 
mark you can have no problem setting
this<00:01:49.259> for<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.500> timing<00:01:49.710> right<00:01:49.920> now<00:01:49.979> if<00:01:50.329> that's

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
this for the timing right now if that's

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.910 
this for the timing right now if that's
if<00:01:51.509> you've<00:01:51.659> got<00:01:51.840> access<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.500> timing<00:01:52.799> light

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
if you've got access to a timing light

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.039 
if you've got access to a timing light
but<00:01:54.829> it's<00:01:55.829> gonna<00:01:56.490> make<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.969> job<00:01:57.240> so<00:01:57.270> much

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
but it's gonna make the job so much

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.899 
but it's gonna make the job so much
easier<00:01:58.110> setting<00:01:58.799> your<00:01:58.920> time<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.250> quick<00:01:59.579> nice

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
easier setting your time I quick nice

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.300 
easier setting your time I quick nice
and<00:02:00.210> easy<00:02:00.420> at<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.840> standard<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.920> harmonic

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
and easy at a standard the the harmonic

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.429 
and easy at a standard the the harmonic
balance<00:02:02.640> back<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.820> little<00:02:03.030> bit<00:02:03.210> hit<00:02:04.049> with<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.290> bit

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
balance back a little bit hit with a bit

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.910 
balance back a little bit hit with a bit
of<00:02:04.469> paint<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:05.460> as<00:02:05.610> I<00:02:05.759> said<00:02:05.820> before<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:07.530> timing

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
of paint and as I said before the timing

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.910 
of paint and as I said before the timing
mark<00:02:08.129> used<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.520> see<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:09.319> under<00:02:10.319> on<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.590> timing

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
mark used to see it under on the timing

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
mark used to see it under on the timing
cover

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
cover

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.670

this<00:02:12.330> little<00:02:12.570> bit<00:02:12.660> of<00:02:12.720> plastic<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.230> indicator

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
this little bit of plastic the indicator

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.090 
this little bit of plastic the indicator
used<00:02:14.460> to<00:02:14.610> sit<00:02:14.850> about<00:02:15.090> five<00:02:15.960> mil<00:02:16.350> over<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:16.920> top

the ass as I said all I did was just

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.830 
the ass as I said all I did was just
chop<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.300> straight<00:02:33.570> off<00:02:33.690> there<00:02:33.960> and<00:02:35.660> made<00:02:36.660> it

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
chop the straight off there and made it

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.740
