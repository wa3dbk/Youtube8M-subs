00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:15.230
 I will show you as much as possible without using 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.630
 wrote off any other devices 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.380
 tie cords literally on 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:27.800
 fingers for this we need yarn 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:31.520
 preferably confusing thicker kai fasten 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.470
 between your index and thumb so 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.690
 that the tip was on the back side 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.239
 palms 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.960
 turn and twist the thread around 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.579
 fingers as if we knit a basket 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:48.350
 docked up the little finger 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:55.700
 back top down gone and now 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:57.649
 repeat the same edge again 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.780
 fasten at the bottom of the palm to be 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.809
 convenient to make it stand out now we 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:07.430
 we can see that we have every on every 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:12.560
 finger was under the two loops perform 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:14.110
 The first row starts always in mating with 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.940
 little finger 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:21.440
 pull the lower loop 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:24.880
 top and remove with your finger then on 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:30.770
 the same finger repeat the same 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:33.520
 then on average 1 row on the index 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:39.350
 finger because we have only one loop 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:42.500
 performed by placing the tip on 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.439
 back of hand between 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:50.020
 index and middle fingers and now 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:54.170
 working thread we continue to weave 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.900
 wrapping around middle and nameless again 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.680
 fingers 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:05.000
 loop around the little finger back row with us 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:10.329
 newly formed two rows of loops we 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:13.940
 again starting communication with the little finger remove 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:20.610
 nameless rented 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:23.300
 shoot again and again now what 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:28.400
 like all fingers with index finger 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.400
 so repeat several times 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:43.310
 loops can be corrected some more 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:00.709
 did you tie a few more rows with 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:04.870
 back side we will see that we have 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:08.780
 it turns out very charming lace 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:15.380
 when the lace reaches the required length 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:16.540
 and then close as close we start with 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:21.680
 little finger 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:23.870
 remove the loop and put it on the nameless 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.739
 finger we get quite 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:30.380
 standard again two loops on the fingers and 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.959
 we are tying them up as usual as we are 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.690
 did before that then again nameless 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.489
 fingers remove the loop dress on the middle 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:44.989
 finger 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:49.420
 knit and so on we shoot 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.420
 last we drag 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:04:02.700
 we have lace and lace 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:06.210
 you can make a ring if you make 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.920
 small then this may be a given piece 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:14.010
 not long enough can be done 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:19.530
 bracelet beech science can make a handle 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:23.160
 for handbags for example, you can make 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:27.050
 just a decoration on the head very much 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:32.840
 applications in quite ordinary 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:35.880
 weaving thank you for attention for you 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:38.040
 there was a master class ekaterina boguslavskaya 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.280
 Especially for the site needlework on point 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.280
