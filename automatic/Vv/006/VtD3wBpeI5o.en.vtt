00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:12.469
 Hello everyone 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:14.719
 today I find you in a 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.570
 new tutorial and it will be the strawberries 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:19.970
 chocolate if you are interested in this tutorial 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:24.099
 stay with me in the meantime here is the 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.099
 list of equipment you need 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.480
 so for a start you will take 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:36.160
 just the pulp is transmissible 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.739
 you're going to make a big pudding that you 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.300
 go cut in three or more or less 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.600
 according to a number of real what you 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.600
 want to do 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.600
 and then you will do three 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.989
 little balls that you started to 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:01:00.850
 gently train into account for 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:02.800
 come do your press which you 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.780
 can make them a lot bigger or 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.880
 small 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.360
 then I take a needle and I 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:13.650
 come like these slightly angled 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.650
 to make troops in the strawberry 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.680
 so we do not hesitate to do well 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.940
 to the top 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.130
 then I plant my strawberry in my 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.710
 needle and I want to start coloring 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:39.660
 not for that I take dry pastels 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:42.160
 so here I take red and brown 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.540
 so the brown is for a little more a 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.090
 turn what is red that otherwise we are 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.030
 a little bit too much so I'm starting 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.390
 by putting my red all over my 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.390
 brother 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:02.040
 and in fact I'm going to leave 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.270
 the slightly transparent space for 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.760
 to do a little as if we were not 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:11.490
 quite mature and then I add a 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.850
 little scope to refine the 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.850
 coloring 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.750
 so you do all the strawberries of the 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.830
 same way then I'll take some 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.810
 glass and brown 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.269
 so to make a color a little bit 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.000
 leaves so if you have a drink already 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.950
 absolutely perfect 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.080
 so I'm going to flatten that date the 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.390
 pasta machine to his years movies and I 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.390
 will cut me the forms of fez 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:47.890
 I have several we remove the surplus has 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.560
 have a little bit done they have the 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.500
 edges a bit too thick and then 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:57.790
 we will come draw finally marked the 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:00.209
 grooves with the back of the scalpel to 2 to 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.209
 simply 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:15.040
 then I decode them delicately and I 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.870
 come move one by one on my little 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.510
 strawberry so I help a little bit of 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.500
 hole that there is above does not give way 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.810
 all the backstage and a little bit 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:31.450
 prettier like that and we put all 30 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:32.829
 minutes at 110 degrees in the oven then I 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.049
 will therefore make my chocolate 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:37.989
 so I'm going to take white and mam 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:39.640
 separately so i'm going to soften have 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.260
 as usual I pass it in the water 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.599
 I softened it until it sticks 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.170
 and then I come there mixed with fiber 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:46.540
 liquid 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.040
 so if you have not followed to see them 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.190
 in info bar I always put the 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.190
 recipe 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.670
 I impose that on a little paper 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:56.590
 aluminum or whatever what you want 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.510
 I add liquid fing 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.950
 so here I show you that with the white 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.950
 but I did exactly the same thing 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.530
 with chocolate color so here 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.750
 then it gives me that once 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.590
 my strawberries are eight to be able to 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.590
 cover with chocolate 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.789
 so I discover well all around for 

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:20.070
 that strawberry sticks well and that is not 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:22.970
 well then a brand of chocolate that 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.970
 would have melted underneath 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.330
 and then I'll do my little decoration 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.800
 so be you read cook another one 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.850
 time is the deco then over 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.130
 to make a 3d effect 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.180
 either do you directly to do 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.710
 like a marbled effects 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.710
 I decided to do it directly 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:50.830
 we put it back in the oven again 30 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:53.020
 minutes at 110 degrees and that's it 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.330
 gives you your strawberries once out of the 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.190
 so then we will polish everything 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.120
 that with the acrylic paint so there I 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.010
 mixture is a little bit of tears 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.140
 still with red but with 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.190
 acrylic paint this time and I 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.530
 am going to add a little bit of color to 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.900
 my strawberry then I came to do the 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.020
 small seed species with yellow 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.950
 mixed with a few other 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.690
 then you just have to 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.180
 green the strawberries and it's over 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.740
 I hope you liked this tutorial I 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.070

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.070
