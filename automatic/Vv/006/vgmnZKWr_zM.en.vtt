00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
really nice now the reason I like the

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:56.200 
really nice now the reason I like the
under<00:01:54.830> folder<00:01:55.100> first<00:01:55.280> of<00:01:55.460> all<00:01:55.550> it's<00:01:55.670> a<00:01:55.700> classic

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
under folder first of all it's a classic

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.620 
under folder first of all it's a classic
ake<00:01:56.360> a<00:01:56.570> look<00:01:56.600> and<00:01:57.340> once<00:01:58.340> it's<00:01:58.550> folded<00:01:58.759> it<00:01:59.390> makes

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
ake a look and once it's folded it makes

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.290 
ake a look and once it's folded it makes
for<00:01:59.840> a<00:01:59.869> very<00:01:59.929> small<00:02:00.500> package<00:02:00.970> you'll<00:02:01.970> notice

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
for a very small package you'll notice

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.700 
for a very small package you'll notice
that<00:02:02.450> you<00:02:02.660> can't<00:02:02.899> get<00:02:03.080> any<00:02:03.229> shorter<00:02:03.440> in<00:02:03.679> length

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
that you can't get any shorter in length

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.160 
that you can't get any shorter in length
once<00:02:04.399> it's<00:02:04.580> folded<00:02:04.759> and<00:02:05.090> also<00:02:05.899> when<00:02:06.050> it's

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
once it's folded and also when it's

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.590 
once it's folded and also when it's
folded<00:02:06.380> it<00:02:07.039> doesn't<00:02:07.369> add<00:02:07.550> any<00:02:07.850> width<00:02:08.360> to<00:02:08.569> the

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
folded it doesn't add any width to the

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.419 
folded it doesn't add any width to the
rifle<00:02:09.080> if<00:02:09.140> you<00:02:09.229> have<00:02:09.319> a<00:02:09.380> side<00:02:09.590> folder<00:02:10.069> it

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
rifle if you have a side folder it

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:11.770 
rifle if you have a side folder it
doubles<00:02:10.850> the<00:02:10.910> thickness<00:02:11.270> of<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:11.420> rifle<00:02:11.750> the

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
doubles the thickness of the rifle the

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.170 
doubles the thickness of the rifle the
under<00:02:12.020> folder<00:02:12.319> stays<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:12.980> same<00:02:13.190> width<00:02:13.430> so

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
under folder stays the same width so

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.160 
under folder stays the same width so
anyway<00:02:14.390> we're<00:02:14.569> just<00:02:14.720> taking<00:02:14.810> a<00:02:14.930> little<00:02:15.020> bit

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
anyway we're just taking a little bit

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.630 
anyway we're just taking a little bit
closer<00:02:15.380> look<00:02:15.560> at<00:02:15.680> this<00:02:15.800> rifle<00:02:15.980> this<00:02:16.190> afternoon

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
closer look at this rifle this afternoon

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:42.830 
closer look at this rifle this afternoon
let's<00:02:17.209> get<00:02:17.390> going

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.630 

the<00:02:43.840> receiver<00:02:44.170> on<00:02:44.350> the<00:02:44.380> rifle<00:02:44.650> is<00:02:45.040> machined

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
the receiver on the rifle is machined

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.670 
the receiver on the rifle is machined
from<00:02:45.790> one<00:02:46.060> solid<00:02:46.540> billet<00:02:46.810> of<00:02:47.020> steel

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
from one solid billet of steel

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.410 
from one solid billet of steel
it<00:02:48.190> makes<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:48.490> rifle<00:02:48.820> a<00:02:48.850> little<00:02:49.030> bit<00:02:49.150> heavier

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
it makes the rifle a little bit heavier

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.880 
it makes the rifle a little bit heavier
