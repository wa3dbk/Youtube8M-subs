end of the foot board and I mean kind of

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.990 
end of the foot board and I mean kind of
closest<00:00:30.380> to<00:00:30.590> the<00:00:30.710> chain<00:00:31.009> or<00:00:31.250> closest<00:00:31.730> to<00:00:31.880> the

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.100 
closest to the chain or closest to the
drumhead<00:00:32.320> then<00:00:33.320> you<00:00:33.500> may<00:00:33.739> not<00:00:34.040> be<00:00:34.190> maximizing

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
drumhead then you may not be maximizing

the<00:00:36.110> efficiency<00:00:36.230> of<00:00:36.739> that<00:00:37.070> technique<00:00:37.519> and<00:00:37.790> let

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
the efficiency of that technique and let

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.479 
the efficiency of that technique and let
me<00:00:38.690> just<00:00:38.720> go<00:00:39.440> into<00:00:39.650> a<00:00:39.680> little<00:00:39.830> bit<00:00:39.949> more<00:00:40.129> detail

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
me just go into a little bit more detail

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:41.590 
me just go into a little bit more detail
about<00:00:40.519> that<00:00:40.760> in<00:00:40.970> fact<00:00:41.059> I'm<00:00:41.210> going<00:00:41.239> to<00:00:41.360> grab<00:00:41.480> a

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
about that in fact I'm going to grab a

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.420 
about that in fact I'm going to grab a
stick<00:00:41.930> and<00:00:42.080> just<00:00:42.290> show<00:00:42.410> you<00:00:42.500> that<00:00:42.620> imagine

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
stick and just show you that imagine

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.700 
stick and just show you that imagine
that<00:00:43.460> is<00:00:43.730> the<00:00:43.940> angle<00:00:44.690> of<00:00:44.809> our<00:00:44.960> foot<00:00:45.230> board<00:00:45.500> and

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
that is the angle of our foot board and

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.650 
that is the angle of our foot board and
our<00:00:46.010> foot<00:00:46.370> kind<00:00:46.670> of<00:00:46.760> rests<00:00:47.059> on<00:00:47.150> the<00:00:47.300> footboard

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
our foot kind of rests on the footboard

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.900 
our foot kind of rests on the footboard
like<00:00:47.900> this<00:00:48.110> if<00:00:48.320> we<00:00:48.920> have<00:00:49.160> our<00:00:49.339> foot<00:00:49.640> all<00:00:49.850> the

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
like this if we have our foot all the

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.270 
like this if we have our foot all the
way<00:00:50.120> at<00:00:50.329> the<00:00:50.360> top<00:00:50.629> of<00:00:50.690> the<00:00:50.839> pedal<00:00:51.199> here<00:00:51.410> we've

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
way at the top of the pedal here we've

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.630 
way at the top of the pedal here we've
got<00:00:52.460> a<00:00:52.489> large<00:00:52.850> distance<00:00:53.239> for<00:00:53.750> it<00:00:53.839> to<00:00:54.019> move

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
got a large distance for it to move

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.630 
got a large distance for it to move
downwards<00:00:55.640> before<00:00:56.600> the<00:00:56.780> the<00:00:57.110> beta<00:00:57.640> connects

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
downwards before the the beta connects

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.689 
downwards before the the beta connects
with<00:00:58.820> the<00:00:58.940> drumhead<00:00:59.260> if<00:01:00.260> we<00:01:01.070> have<00:01:01.250> our<00:01:01.430> foot

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
with the drumhead if we have our foot

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:04.000 
with the drumhead if we have our foot
halfway<00:01:02.269> down<00:01:02.720> the<00:01:02.780> board<00:01:03.170> then<00:01:03.739> obviously

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
halfway down the board then obviously

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.480 
halfway down the board then obviously
that<00:01:04.369> distance<00:01:04.879> there<00:01:05.239> is<00:01:05.360> a<00:01:05.930> lot<00:01:06.260> less<00:01:06.500> so

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
that distance there is a lot less so

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.929 
that distance there is a lot less so
just<00:01:07.790> be<00:01:07.939> up<00:01:08.030> by<00:01:08.240> the<00:01:08.299> mere<00:01:09.049> fact<00:01:09.140> of<00:01:09.939> physics

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 
just be up by the mere fact of physics

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:13.929 
just be up by the mere fact of physics
and<00:01:11.140> trigonometry<00:01:12.140> I<00:01:12.170> guess<00:01:12.490> it<00:01:13.490> makes<00:01:13.729> it<00:01:13.880> a

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:13.939 
and trigonometry I guess it makes it a

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:16.240 
and trigonometry I guess it makes it a
lot<00:01:14.119> more<00:01:14.180> efficient<00:01:14.869> if<00:01:15.350> you<00:01:15.500> go<00:01:15.619> too<00:01:15.680> low

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
lot more efficient if you go too low

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.530 
lot more efficient if you go too low
obviously<00:01:16.880> you're<00:01:16.970> going<00:01:17.090> to<00:01:17.150> have<00:01:17.240> to<00:01:17.330> put<00:01:17.510> a

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
obviously you're going to have to put a

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.210 
obviously you're going to have to put a
lot<00:01:17.869> more<00:01:17.900> effort<00:01:18.470> because<00:01:18.619> obviously<00:01:18.920> you're

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
lot more effort because obviously you're

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.190 
lot more effort because obviously you're
gonna<00:01:19.369> have<00:01:19.520> to<00:01:19.640> the<00:01:20.240> turning<00:01:20.630> force<00:01:20.900> there<00:01:21.170> is

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
gonna have to the turning force there is

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.380 
gonna have to the turning force there is
not<00:01:21.439> very<00:01:21.650> very<00:01:22.460> great<00:01:22.790> so<00:01:23.060> often<00:01:23.330> you're

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
not very very great so often you're

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.060 
not very very great so often you're
going<00:01:23.450> to<00:01:23.600> have<00:01:23.689> to<00:01:23.780> put<00:01:23.960> a<00:01:23.990> lot<00:01:24.200> more<00:01:24.260> effort

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
going to have to put a lot more effort

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.710 
going to have to put a lot more effort
in<00:01:25.190> if<00:01:25.370> you're<00:01:25.460> really<00:01:25.910> really<00:01:26.120> low<00:01:26.360> down<00:01:26.570> the

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
in if you're really really low down the

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.930 
in if you're really really low down the
board<00:01:26.960> but<00:01:27.830> there<00:01:27.980> will<00:01:28.160> be<00:01:28.310> a<00:01:28.340> point<00:01:28.610> on<00:01:28.820> the

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
board but there will be a point on the

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.820 
board but there will be a point on the
board<00:01:29.120> where<00:01:29.450> you'll<00:01:29.900> start<00:01:30.290> to<00:01:30.380> play<00:01:30.680> around

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
board where you'll start to play around

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.470 
board where you'll start to play around
with<00:01:31.160> maybe<00:01:31.370> some<00:01:31.460> multiple<00:01:32.150> stroke

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:32.480 
with maybe some multiple stroke

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.340 
with maybe some multiple stroke
techniques<00:01:33.310> like<00:01:34.310> the<00:01:34.820> step<00:01:35.210> slide<00:01:35.600> technique

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
techniques like the step slide technique

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.480 
techniques like the step slide technique
or<00:01:36.590> the<00:01:37.550> heel<00:01:38.480> toe<00:01:38.840> technique<00:01:39.350> popularized<00:01:40.340> by

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
or the heel toe technique popularized by

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.649 
or the heel toe technique popularized by
players<00:01:41.390> like<00:01:41.630> Steve<00:01:41.960> Gadd<00:01:42.790> this<00:01:43.790> kind<00:01:44.570> of

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
players like Steve Gadd this kind of

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.050 
players like Steve Gadd this kind of
sweet<00:01:44.960> spot<00:01:45.320> of<00:01:45.350> the<00:01:45.560> pedal<00:01:45.920> will<00:01:46.159> enable<00:01:46.640> you

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
sweet spot of the pedal will enable you

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.060 
sweet spot of the pedal will enable you
to<00:01:47.090> not<00:01:47.780> only<00:01:47.900> get<00:01:48.140> started<00:01:48.710> with<00:01:48.890> those

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
to not only get started with those

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.950 
to not only get started with those
techniques<00:01:49.520> but<00:01:50.030> also<00:01:50.180> make<00:01:50.570> them<00:01:50.690> really

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
techniques but also make them really

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.200 
techniques but also make them really
really<00:01:51.020> efficient<00:01:51.740> and<00:01:51.909> hopefully<00:01:52.909> when<00:01:53.090> you

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
really efficient and hopefully when you

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.780 
really efficient and hopefully when you
come<00:01:53.450> to<00:01:53.690> perform<00:01:54.290> you<00:01:55.280> won't<00:01:55.580> be<00:01:55.760> thinking

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
come to perform you won't be thinking

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.450 
come to perform you won't be thinking
about<00:01:56.210> these<00:01:56.590> techniques<00:01:57.590> too<00:01:57.979> much<00:01:58.220> you'll

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
about these techniques too much you'll

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.800 
about these techniques too much you'll
just<00:01:58.640> be<00:01:58.820> out<00:01:58.940> if<00:01:59.210> you've<00:01:59.330> done<00:01:59.510> the<00:01:59.630> practice

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
just be out if you've done the practice

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.140 
just be out if you've done the practice
you'll<00:02:00.470> just<00:02:00.680> be<00:02:00.830> able<00:02:00.950> to<00:02:01.040> engage<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:01.610> foot

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
you'll just be able to engage the foot

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.899 
you'll just be able to engage the foot
at<00:02:02.510> that<00:02:02.870> sweet<00:02:03.140> spot<00:02:03.460> naturally<00:02:04.460> fear<00:02:04.670> well

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
at that sweet spot naturally fear well

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.169 
at that sweet spot naturally fear well
it<00:02:05.060> where<00:02:05.479> it<00:02:05.600> is<00:02:05.780> and<00:02:06.100> go<00:02:07.100> for<00:02:07.310> these<00:02:07.400> specific

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
it where it is and go for these specific

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.809 
it where it is and go for these specific
techniques<00:02:08.950> so<00:02:09.950> what<00:02:10.250> I'm<00:02:10.340> going<00:02:10.459> to<00:02:10.519> do<00:02:10.640> now

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
techniques so what I'm going to do now

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:12.130 
techniques so what I'm going to do now
I'm<00:02:10.879> just<00:02:11.000> going<00:02:11.180> to<00:02:11.209> turn<00:02:11.629> around<00:02:11.659> till<00:02:12.049> the

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
I'm just going to turn around till the

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.710 
I'm just going to turn around till the
kick<00:02:12.319> kick<00:02:12.860> pedal<00:02:13.250> and<00:02:13.450> show<00:02:14.450> you<00:02:14.510> this

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
kick kick pedal and show you this

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.380 
kick kick pedal and show you this
position<00:02:15.230> so<00:02:15.769> I<00:02:16.069> will<00:02:16.280> try<00:02:16.459> and<00:02:16.580> avoid<00:02:16.940> in<00:02:17.330> the

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
position so I will try and avoid in the

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.199 
position so I will try and avoid in the
heel<00:02:17.840> up<00:02:18.019> position<00:02:18.440> my<00:02:18.950> toe<00:02:19.010> all<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:19.640> way<00:02:19.849> up

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
heel up position my toe all the way up

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:21.640 
heel up position my toe all the way up
at<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.390> top<00:02:20.480> of<00:02:20.659> the<00:02:20.810> board<00:02:21.019> like<00:02:21.260> it<00:02:21.409> is<00:02:21.500> at

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
at the top of the board like it is at

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.820 
at the top of the board like it is at
the<00:02:21.739> moment<00:02:21.769> I<00:02:22.310> would<00:02:23.269> generally<00:02:24.170> come<00:02:24.470> down

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
the moment I would generally come down

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.130 
the moment I would generally come down
to<00:02:25.040> about<00:02:25.310> this<00:02:25.940> position<00:02:26.450> here<00:02:26.480> it's<00:02:26.900> about<00:02:26.959> a

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
to about this position here it's about a

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.869 
to about this position here it's about a
third<00:02:27.560> I<00:02:27.830> guess<00:02:28.010> of<00:02:28.189> the<00:02:28.279> way<00:02:28.430> down<00:02:28.670> the

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
third I guess of the way down the

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.780 
third I guess of the way down the
footboard<00:02:29.299> now<00:02:30.079> if<00:02:30.379> I<00:02:30.650> make<00:02:30.859> a<00:02:30.889> few<00:02:31.249> strokes<00:02:31.549> in

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
footboard now if I make a few strokes in

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.580 
footboard now if I make a few strokes in
the<00:02:31.909> heel<00:02:32.150> up<00:02:32.359> position<00:02:32.930> it's<00:02:33.200> going<00:02:33.379> to<00:02:33.439> look

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
the heel up position it's going to look

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.970 
the heel up position it's going to look
a<00:02:33.650> little

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
a little

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:43.149 
a little
like<00:02:34.099> this<00:02:41.049> now<00:02:42.049> you<00:02:42.110> may<00:02:42.560> be<00:02:42.590> able<00:02:42.799> to<00:02:42.920> see

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:43.159 
like this now you may be able to see

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:48.100 
like this now you may be able to see
there<00:02:43.370> is<00:02:43.580> the<00:02:44.440> ankle<00:02:45.440> joint<00:02:45.500> is<00:02:45.920> flexing<00:02:47.110> but

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
there is the ankle joint is flexing but

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.539 
there is the ankle joint is flexing but
that's<00:02:48.260> not<00:02:48.409> the<00:02:48.560> only<00:02:48.590> thing<00:02:48.950> that's<00:02:49.340> moving

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
that's not the only thing that's moving

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:51.970 
that's not the only thing that's moving
in<00:02:49.940> my<00:02:50.239> in<00:02:50.660> my<00:02:50.720> leg<00:02:51.140> here<00:02:51.440> I'm<00:02:51.590> actually

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
in my in my leg here I'm actually

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.400 
in my in my leg here I'm actually
engaging<00:02:52.549> my<00:02:52.940> hip<00:02:53.180> flexors<00:02:53.690> the<00:02:53.840> muscles<00:02:54.260> in

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
engaging my hip flexors the muscles in

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.070 
engaging my hip flexors the muscles in
my<00:02:54.440> hips<00:02:54.940> that<00:02:55.940> actually<00:02:56.090> the<00:02:56.360> move<00:02:56.540> my<00:02:56.750> thigh

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
my hips that actually the move my thigh

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.770 
my hips that actually the move my thigh
so<00:02:57.769> I'm<00:02:57.890> actually<00:02:58.069> using<00:02:58.489> the<00:02:58.670> whole<00:02:59.239> of<00:02:59.269> my

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
so I'm actually using the whole of my

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.130 
so I'm actually using the whole of my
leg<00:03:00.110> to<00:03:00.410> play<00:03:00.590> this<00:03:00.799> stroke<00:03:01.810> but<00:03:02.810> I'm<00:03:02.959> also

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
leg to play this stroke but I'm also

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.380 
leg to play this stroke but I'm also
using<00:03:03.379> a<00:03:03.890> little<00:03:04.159> bit<00:03:04.250> of<00:03:04.340> affliction<00:03:04.909> down<00:03:05.180> at

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
using a little bit of affliction down at

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.150 
using a little bit of affliction down at
the<00:03:05.480> ankle<00:03:05.840> joint<00:03:05.870> there<00:03:06.349> now<00:03:06.590> these<00:03:06.769> two

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
the ankle joint there now these two

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.410 
the ankle joint there now these two
specific<00:03:08.120> movements<00:03:08.629> are<00:03:08.750> what<00:03:09.170> gives<00:03:09.470> this

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
specific movements are what gives this

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.950 
specific movements are what gives this
heal<00:03:11.420> up<00:03:11.599> technique<00:03:12.079> its<00:03:12.349> power

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:13.960 
heal up technique its power

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.340 
heal up technique its power
if<00:03:14.590> I<00:03:14.830> was<00:03:15.010> to<00:03:15.310> go<00:03:16.180> in<00:03:16.330> to<00:03:16.480> heal<00:03:16.720> up<00:03:16.900> position

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
if I was to go in to heal up position

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.300 
if I was to go in to heal up position
but<00:03:17.560> had<00:03:17.710> to<00:03:17.890> have<00:03:18.040> my<00:03:18.220> heel<00:03:18.730> really<00:03:19.200> high<00:03:20.200> and

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
but had to have my heel really high and

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.720 
but had to have my heel really high and
kind<00:03:21.310> of<00:03:21.430> really<00:03:21.910> flex<00:03:22.360> my<00:03:23.140> calf<00:03:23.980> muscle<00:03:24.460> here

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
kind of really flex my calf muscle here

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.400 
kind of really flex my calf muscle here
so<00:03:24.940> that<00:03:25.120> my<00:03:25.240> heel<00:03:25.540> is<00:03:25.720> very<00:03:25.930> high<00:03:26.170> off<00:03:26.290> the

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
so that my heel is very high off the

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.850 
so that my heel is very high off the
ground<00:03:26.620> I'm<00:03:27.100> a<00:03:27.300> position<00:03:28.300> now<00:03:28.480> where<00:03:28.510> I<00:03:28.990> can't

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
ground I'm a position now where I can't

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.420 
ground I'm a position now where I can't
actually<00:03:30.040> flex<00:03:30.580> my<00:03:31.020> my<00:03:32.020> ankle<00:03:32.680> joint<00:03:32.890> anymore

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
actually flex my my ankle joint anymore

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.940 
actually flex my my ankle joint anymore
so<00:03:34.360> now<00:03:34.630> I've<00:03:34.810> closed<00:03:35.260> off<00:03:35.470> that<00:03:35.680> type<00:03:35.920> of

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
so now I've closed off that type of

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.760 
so now I've closed off that type of
movement<00:03:36.310> that<00:03:36.640> ankle<00:03:37.090> movement<00:03:37.500> in<00:03:38.500> my

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
movement that ankle movement in my

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.660 
movement that ankle movement in my
stroke<00:03:39.190> so<00:03:39.910> I<00:03:39.940> can<00:03:40.210> only<00:03:40.420> make<00:03:40.840> the<00:03:41.110> sound<00:03:41.670> by

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
stroke so I can only make the sound by

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:48.420 
stroke so I can only make the sound by
moving<00:03:44.340> from<00:03:45.340> my<00:03:45.370> hip<00:03:45.850> joint<00:03:47.070> now<00:03:48.070> this<00:03:48.370> is

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
moving from my hip joint now this is

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.610 
moving from my hip joint now this is
quite<00:03:48.790> a<00:03:48.820> common<00:03:49.270> trait<00:03:49.510> in<00:03:49.810> drummers<00:03:50.290> who<00:03:50.410> go

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
quite a common trait in drummers who go

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.350 
quite a common trait in drummers who go
to<00:03:50.650> play<00:03:50.980> here<00:03:51.250> lap<00:03:51.430> is<00:03:51.550> they<00:03:51.700> generally<00:03:52.090> have

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
to play here lap is they generally have

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.990 
to play here lap is they generally have
their<00:03:52.540> heels<00:03:52.780> way<00:03:53.140> too<00:03:53.200> high<00:03:53.770> and<00:03:54.100> they<00:03:54.610> close

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
their heels way too high and they close

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.850 
their heels way too high and they close
off<00:03:55.030> this<00:03:55.390> movement<00:03:55.690> in<00:03:55.990> the<00:03:56.110> Aqua<00:03:56.380> ankle

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
off this movement in the Aqua ankle

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.730 
off this movement in the Aqua ankle
joint<00:03:57.090> so<00:03:58.090> if<00:03:58.390> you<00:03:58.750> are<00:03:58.900> already<00:03:59.110> doing<00:03:59.440> that

00:03:59.730 --> 00:03:59.740 
joint so if you are already doing that

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.320 
joint so if you are already doing that
you<00:03:59.860> may<00:04:00.100> want<00:04:00.460> to<00:04:00.550> just<00:04:01.350> in<00:04:02.350> your<00:04:02.890> practice

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
you may want to just in your practice

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.300 
you may want to just in your practice
either<00:04:04.330> video<00:04:04.810> yourself<00:04:05.140> or<00:04:05.650> maybe<00:04:05.920> have<00:04:06.280> a

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
either video yourself or maybe have a

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.130 
either video yourself or maybe have a
mirror<00:04:06.730> at<00:04:06.880> the<00:04:06.970> side<00:04:07.210> of<00:04:07.240> the<00:04:07.390> kit<00:04:07.690> so<00:04:07.870> you<00:04:07.900> can

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
mirror at the side of the kit so you can

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.340 
mirror at the side of the kit so you can
just<00:04:08.380> see<00:04:08.730> if<00:04:09.730> you<00:04:10.030> have<00:04:10.180> any<00:04:10.300> tendencies<00:04:11.170> in

just see if you have any tendencies in
your<00:04:11.770> foot<00:04:11.950> technique<00:04:12.340> that<00:04:12.580> are<00:04:13.060> kind<00:04:13.330> of

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
your foot technique that are kind of

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.290 
your foot technique that are kind of
inhibiting<00:04:14.200> access<00:04:15.190> to<00:04:15.400> specific<00:04:15.640> techniques

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:16.300 
inhibiting access to specific techniques

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:21.180 
inhibiting access to specific techniques
and<00:04:16.570> all<00:04:17.440> volumes

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.390 

now<00:04:22.180> once<00:04:22.480> you<00:04:22.810> found<00:04:23.230> the<00:04:23.560> sweet<00:04:23.710> spot<00:04:23.860> of<00:04:24.190> the

now once you found the sweet spot of the

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.390 
now once you found the sweet spot of the
pedal<00:04:24.760> and<00:04:24.940> you're<00:04:25.600> not<00:04:25.840> over<00:04:26.200> extending<00:04:26.470> your

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
pedal and you're not over extending your

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.230 
pedal and you're not over extending your
ankle<00:04:27.910> joint<00:04:28.180> you<00:04:28.930> should<00:04:29.200> be<00:04:29.350> able<00:04:29.500> to<00:04:29.740> access

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
ankle joint you should be able to access

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.320 
ankle joint you should be able to access
some<00:04:31.240> multiple<00:04:31.840> stroke<00:04:32.170> techniques<00:04:32.680> and

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
some multiple stroke techniques and

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.670 
some multiple stroke techniques and
there's<00:04:34.330> two<00:04:34.600> that<00:04:34.840> really<00:04:34.960> spring<00:04:35.380> to<00:04:35.530> mind

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
there's two that really spring to mind

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.340 
there's two that really spring to mind
for<00:04:35.920> me<00:04:36.360> one<00:04:37.360> of<00:04:37.510> which<00:04:37.660> is<00:04:37.690> sometimes

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
for me one of which is sometimes

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.700 
for me one of which is sometimes
referred<00:04:38.590> to<00:04:38.830> as<00:04:39.010> either<00:04:40.260> step<00:04:41.260> slide

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
referred to as either step slide

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.120 
referred to as either step slide
technique<00:04:42.280> or<00:04:42.610> foot<00:04:43.330> leg<00:04:43.750> technique<00:04:44.320> and<00:04:44.620> this

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
technique or foot leg technique and this

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.570 
technique or foot leg technique and this
is<00:04:45.250> where<00:04:45.400> we<00:04:45.550> produce<00:04:45.790> two<00:04:46.750> notes<00:04:47.380> in<00:04:47.740> quick

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
is where we produce two notes in quick

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.190 
is where we produce two notes in quick
succession<00:04:48.760> and<00:04:49.300> that<00:04:49.630> looks<00:04:49.810> a<00:04:49.930> little<00:04:50.050> bit

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
succession and that looks a little bit

00:04:50.200 --> 00:05:00.360 
succession and that looks a little bit
like<00:04:50.350> this<00:04:57.930> ok<00:04:58.930> the<00:04:59.080> other<00:04:59.230> multiple<00:05:00.070> stroke

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
like this ok the other multiple stroke

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.910 
like this ok the other multiple stroke
technique<00:05:00.580> that's<00:05:01.570> associated<00:05:01.900> with<00:05:02.410> heel<00:05:02.740> up

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:02.920 
technique that's associated with heel up

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.270 
technique that's associated with heel up
position<00:05:03.490> is<00:05:04.770> sometimes<00:05:05.770> referred<00:05:05.950> to<00:05:06.130> as

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
position is sometimes referred to as

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.200 
position is sometimes referred to as
heel<00:05:07.120> toe<00:05:07.570> technique<00:05:08.460> constant<00:05:09.460> release<00:05:09.670> and

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
heel toe technique constant release and

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.180 
heel toe technique constant release and
is<00:05:10.570> probably<00:05:10.900> most<00:05:11.170> commonly<00:05:11.710> associated

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
is probably most commonly associated

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.160 
is probably most commonly associated
with<00:05:12.400> players<00:05:12.820> such<00:05:12.970> as<00:05:13.150> Steve<00:05:13.570> Gadd<00:05:13.900> and

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.170 
with players such as Steve Gadd and

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:17.550 
with players such as Steve Gadd and
Steve<00:05:15.070> Smith<00:05:15.690> so<00:05:16.690> that<00:05:16.870> looks<00:05:16.990> a<00:05:17.200> little<00:05:17.380> bit

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
Steve Smith so that looks a little bit

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:32.910 
Steve Smith so that looks a little bit
like<00:05:17.710> this

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:32.920 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.560 

okay<00:05:33.920> so<00:05:33.980> your<00:05:34.280> call<00:05:34.580> to<00:05:34.760> action<00:05:34.790> this<00:05:35.300> month
