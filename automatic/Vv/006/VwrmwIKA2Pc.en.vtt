00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.879
 the stomach wall leading nearly 4 liters of gastric juice per day 

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:18.060
 just as saliva these glands can inject liquidity before the simple 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.409
 idea of ​​food 

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:23.909
 the gastric juice also contains an enzyme fancy nothing 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.880
 it is to break down proteins into their basic molecules the amino acids 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.790
 here there is already a small absorption of nutrients the food is in this place 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.460
 from two to six hours 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.970
 the muscle contractions and are running well squeezed and mix the 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:44.590
 food 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.460
 facilitating the action of the gastric juice it turns of the year a thick beast 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.200
 the so-called tub 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.610
 the food machine of humans which is very versatile 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.610
 but it does not account for everything you put inside it 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.199
 some foods have structures that you just can not digest 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.640
 unless someone lent a helping hand 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.600
 our organization can absorb the nutrients of potatoes and soybeans 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.510
 after their chemical structures that are multipliers 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.950
 the date through knowledge 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.890
 the fire has been allied to the cook since prehistoric times 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.990
 heat are other fibers that contain proteins and carbohydrates 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.630
 cooking also destroys many of the harmful bacteria that 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.630
 foods 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.210
 aromas and flavors also play an important role 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.160
 stimulate your glands to produce saliva lesson with the traffic 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.480
 also give expert pleasures in cooking 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.710
 some 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.830
 the slice of bread burns in a few seconds 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.820
 if she released your energy so soon has your whole body you 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.820
 it would also become smoke 

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:21.589
 the body has more subtle ways to distract the energy from the line 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:24.809
 but no matter how that energy is released 

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:27.809
 the same foods will always release the same amount of energy 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:34.379
 this experiment reveals the amount of energy of a white sugar exactly 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.379
 half a gram of color the carbohydrate 

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:45.449
 the energy emitted in calories in the pump 'calorimetry the sugar that is in the 

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:46.569
 hour 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.039
 it produces how much calories 

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:52.069
 with a teaspoon of sugar amounted to 20 calories 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.030
 all carbohydrates produce approximately the same amount of 

00:02:57.029 --> 00:03:00.029
 energy 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.739
 other foods may be more or less efficient as 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.549
 energy 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:11.449
 fat contains more than twice as many calories as carbohydrate 

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:15.170
 while sugar you can provide you with attack energy 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.610
 fatty foods provide fuel in a more 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.610
 concentrated 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:26.689
 It's been almost three hours since they've been driving and had breakfast 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:31.009
 most of the meal has already come out of his stomach began his journey of 

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:34.009
 six meters through the small intestine 

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:38.710
 if it is not treated since early in its turn it continues as red 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.710
 the adult human would be nine feet tall 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:48.100
 instead the issue intestines whimsically curled into spirals 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.100
 to fit the body size 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.289
 floor 

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:55.899
 hugo 

00:03:55.899 --> 00:04:00.109
 the hirings made by the people with whom I go out of the stomach 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:02.179
 through this letter in which they spoke 

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:06.129
 each contraction of these threats from a teaspoon of kiambu to the beginning 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:07.540
 of the small intestine 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.540
 the homeless 

00:04:18.809 --> 00:04:20.510
 the inside of the bullshit 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.250
 becomes the coating specially created to absorb the 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.250
 constituents of food 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:32.159
 for a year 

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:34.879
 carmo 

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:36.699
 the world 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:39.840
 these small horseshoe-shaped projections 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.770
 video calls ages 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.819
 increase the area of ​​nutrient absorption 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:48.949
 not just sour small intestine an area ten times larger than the 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:54.729
 that is enough to carry in a room with a 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.719
 here the nutrients are being invested thin to the bloodstream 

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:06.400
 each of these small villages become dissatisfied with a network of vessels 

00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:09.740
 they almost ruined their headquarters. 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.840
 the bricks of which different groups are composed sugars lines by 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.930
 while then 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.599
 the fat choose two ways 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:23.289
 falls directly into the blood vessels and goes to the liver or goes to 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:26.889
 the lymphatic vessels that flow into the blood circulation 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:29.889
 close to the heart 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.080
 this microscopic residence of blood vessels 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.879
 wrapping on top of a roof to serve the food components 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:48.039
 after you eat a heavy meal the booth increases the flow to 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:50.710
 these capillaries 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.780
 to compensate for the deviation of the toilet 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.080
 It's best to have a party after lunch. 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.830
 than a football match 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.509
 you are what you eat 

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:04.210
 so a balanced diet is critical to the health of the body 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:08.509
 The science of nutrition has defined the essential ingredients of thousands of 

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:12.379
 different foods the human body only needs 40 different nutrients 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.180
 just it 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.119
 there is no perfect diet 

00:06:16.119 --> 00:06:19.269
 what is good food for some individuals can do harm to others 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:24.010
 but somehow we all need these essential nutrients to 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:27.010
 stay alive she 

00:06:29.339 --> 00:06:32.829
 fruits are rich in mineral sugars and vitamins 

00:06:46.029 --> 00:06:49.479
 vitamin C is responsible for the health of our 

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:52.479
 of the 22 seriously injured 

00:06:56.569 --> 00:07:00.759
 the vegetables that are an excellent source of carbohydrates and 

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:04.350
 also contains vitamins and minerals that do well for the track 

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:09.069
 let them contain vitamin E 

00:07:09.719 --> 00:07:13.730
 meat and dairy products contains fat and celtic protein 

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:17.180
 which helps to maintain healthy nails of the skin with the hair 

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:21.729
 the beans have an excellent 

00:07:21.729 --> 00:07:25.650
 source of nutrients but can only be eaten after they are ripe where they are 

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:28.819
 green they contain toxic substances 

00:07:28.819 --> 00:07:32.069
 cereal course in fibers that are not digested by the body 

00:07:32.069 --> 00:07:35.819
 these fibers help food to move through the intestine 

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:40.900
 vitamins are important but in general very small quantities already 

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.180
 that's enough 

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:45.770
 in the case of some of them a teaspoon is enough for a lifetime 

00:07:47.619 --> 00:07:50.699
 to digest all and variety of substances 

00:07:50.699 --> 00:07:53.330
 various glands that produce a sedative cocktail 

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.330
 digestive juices 

00:07:57.599 --> 00:08:01.020
 with the end of the year the bilharinho pancreas 

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:05.290
 discharged its call of the chemicals in the same duct that empties in the duodenum 

00:08:05.289 --> 00:08:09.530
 through a small valve called the sphincter of the
