00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.080
 hello people 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.330
 You can show which one I show you today 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.070
 a bug video but no it is a very 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.910
 very very very very very cool do it 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.039
 yourself because, first, it's a decoration idea 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.350
 is, and secondly, still a lot 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.449
 more a super super nice gift idea 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.240
 I so self not seen 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.760
 and it is brad in baku 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.000
 what that is exactly and how you do it 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.790
 that would have needed now and indeed 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.469
 of course some ingredients again 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.780
 for the most part you have to be there 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.930
 but let us together 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.550
 give through 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.020
 first, of course, the battle and there 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.149
 is best a one liter 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.719
 milk bottle was with me before cacau 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.370
 in it 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.050
 you can wash them out and have them 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.789
 Let dry in any case there must 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.070
 there is no liquid left in it 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.719
 then a cup because that's just ours 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.730
 Our measuring range is, so to speak 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:01.379
 sized mugs a teaspoon and a 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.180
 If you are not so baking paper 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.680
 a funnel part you have with what you do 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.150
 We can empathize in bottles 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.720
 Maybe we can make it out of it 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:15.010
 quite well then to the ingredients whole 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:21.610
 plain white flour brown sugar 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:25.540
 oatmeal white sugar walnuts 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:29.560
 a bit of salt a bit of cinnamon natron 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:32.320
 and baking powder chocolate chips or too 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.390
 called chocolate droplets and that's it 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.800
 and then you can start as well 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.930
 as I said with the funnel because I 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.660
 just do not have what you have me 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.610
 just make a baking dish out of the baking paper 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.230
 which then comes in the bottle where I have the 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.000
 simply empathize things much better 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.300
 It can be very easy and it gets 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.350
 each one of you in any case 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.120
 then we can go with the layers 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.160
 start with the first charge 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.160
 and there is now only times a 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.470
 teaspoon of natron pure and two teaspoons 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.360
 baking powder that we together with 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.310
 mix the first cup of mail 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.580
 or fill in the bottle 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.960
 be the first layer the whole then 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.429
 knock on it a bit 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.130
 the layers are a bit ebner and 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.290
 then it goes on and with a 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.209
 half teaspoon cinnamon and brown sugar 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.570
 and half a cup of brown 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.940
 sugar 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.270
 He also comes in and distributes it 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.270
 become 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.300
 Next is the white sugar and that 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.490
 there comes a half cup of white sugar 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.280
 in and I have half more 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.380
 teaspoon of salt 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:38.330
 then the oatmeal comes in the pure 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:40.860
 are three quarters of oatmeal 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.360
 then a little more flour because of it 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.320
 looks and looks nicer in the stratification 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:49.170
 Although half a cup on top of that 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.150
 chocolate chips that's exactly one 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.950
 half cup and then I have to 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.260
 Finally, the walnuts are crushed 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.810
 that's half a cup and so on 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.610
 completely filled up the bottle because I 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.620
 I found the decorative more beautiful 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.450
 Cover of the bottle in baking paper 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.460
 packed because it is a bit nicer 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.240
 looks and then turned the whole thing 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.560
 and at the end you have rating buttle what 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.480
 Actually nothing else than one 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.610
 nice baking mix the one as super 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.650
 can give away well and the optically 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.360
 really what makes the ingredients for it 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.520
 Of course you can exchange like you 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.170
 it wanted to have and what I very 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.630
 A label would be well suited 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.460
 to make what you stick on it and 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.620
 Although where are the ingredients on the up 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.420
 now are in it and the ingredients are still 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.220
 pure must, so to speak, the whole 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.050
 liquid thus the one of the 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.370
 also knows how to get his board or 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:39.720
 lowers or whatever 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.850
 Prepared pretty much here and must 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.900
 The opportunity in any case I find 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.520
 the result is very nice 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.780
 so it can theoretically 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.310
 use decorative 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.410
 otherwise I just think a lot 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.069
 very nice thing to give away 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.079
 for example, not that 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.090
 it would come would be like the mother come 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:56.859
 would be for example mother's day 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.349
 It takes a while, but I think so 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:00.819
 It just looks so awesome cool 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.439
 I've seen more here now and the 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.999
 ingredients written on it a bit 

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:05.739
 as a label camera is a bit 

00:04:03.999 --> 00:04:07.599
 make it more beautiful and the lids fall beautifully 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.760
 has just the brand of the cocoa 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:12.370
 milk shows what was in here 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.319
 and I think that's really cool 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.690
 Of course you can vary a lot 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.400
 the cookies can also be in battle 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.859
 was something so that we now also he 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.270
 a sweet bread thus the job chips and 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.460
 the wine and the sugar and so on 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.470
 But it can also be delicious as bread 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.970
 or as cake or so and mr 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.169
 important would be just if now 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.970
 want to give away that they just still 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:32.650
 write down what liquid ingredients 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.389
 you have to give and then have 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.099
 the one that really just super that 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:38.169
 just to dump it all in somewhere 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:39.580
 and to give the funny things in 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:41.169
 In this case, the three things are here 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.840
 that would still butter milk eggs and 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:45.340
 butter melted butter and then 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.720
 You could just do it in the oven 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.310
 that's why I have here too 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.479
 written again because I'm four 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.820
 degree and for how long 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:53.139
 and i love this idea i am the 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.310
 just so cool 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:56.650
 you can of course also any other 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.259
 We take pleasure in that 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:02.289
 but overall just looks more 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:03.699
 this layer so yes i think i am 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:05.320
 big fan of it i hope you can 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:06.849
 somehow connect this idea 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.560
 I have this idea on a block 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:10.539
 seen or on a website the 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.039
 I link you in the infobox and 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:14.050
 Also the recipe now from the 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:14.830
 exactly and what they have to pay attention to and so on 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.780
 on and on 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.099
 and I hope you have a lot of fun 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.750
 for you to do it either for you 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:22.150
 even a little less sense 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.949
 Actually or for somebody 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.690
 give away what then I believe again 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:27.610
 very very beautiful is really very very 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.720
 beautiful I am I am very pleased 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.240
 So sorry I have to do that again 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.919
 say I am very pleased with it and 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.659
 hope you like this video 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:36.909
 this idea i would like about one 

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:38.060
 thumb break happy and wish you 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:43.800
