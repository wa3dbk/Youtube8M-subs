leverage<00:02:08.250> if<00:02:08.459> you<00:02:08.549> picture<00:02:08.789> is<00:02:09.030> shorter<00:02:09.360> you

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
leverage if you picture is shorter you

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.390 
leverage if you picture is shorter you
can<00:02:09.479> always<00:02:09.810> put<00:02:10.019> little<00:02:10.259> pebbles<00:02:10.709> or<00:02:10.979> maybe<00:02:11.250> a

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
box at the bottom and then the rest is

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.580 
box at the bottom and then the rest is
easy<00:02:15.030> just<00:02:15.209> find<00:02:15.660> some<00:02:15.810> things<00:02:16.019> that<00:02:16.200> will<00:02:16.290> fit

rice into a different color and I'm
using<00:03:33.400> red<00:03:33.760> because<00:03:34.150> red<00:03:34.450> is<00:03:34.900> or<00:03:35.290> Valentine's

Day after its dried in everything we're

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:40.860 
Day after its dried in everything we're
just<00:03:39.700> going<00:03:39.880> to<00:03:40.000> drop<00:03:40.180> it<00:03:40.240> in<00:03:40.540> and<00:03:40.720> you<00:03:40.840> can

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
just going to drop it in and you can

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.050 
just going to drop it in and you can
adjust<00:03:41.350> it<00:03:41.500> maybe<00:03:41.770> you<00:03:41.890> want<00:03:42.100> to<00:03:42.190> slant<00:03:42.520> it<00:03:42.820> or

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
adjust it maybe you want to slant it or

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.450 
adjust it maybe you want to slant it or
whatever<00:03:43.510> position<00:03:44.140> you<00:03:44.470> want<00:03:44.680> it<00:03:44.800> in<00:03:44.980> you

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:45.460 
whatever position you want it in you

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:46.770 
whatever position you want it in you
don't<00:03:45.580> have<00:03:45.730> to<00:03:45.940> put<00:03:46.120> it<00:03:46.240> there<00:03:46.450> and

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
don't have to put it there and

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.900 
don't have to put it there and
particularly<00:03:47.320> there<00:03:47.800> it's<00:03:47.920> up<00:03:48.100> see<00:03:48.520> where<00:03:48.790> you

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
particularly there it's up see where you

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.480 
particularly there it's up see where you
want<00:03:49.090> to<00:03:49.240> put<00:03:49.450> it<00:03:49.600> and<00:03:50.440> of<00:03:50.800> course<00:03:51.040> you<00:03:51.190> want<00:03:51.340> to

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.490 
want to put it and of course you want to

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.010 
want to put it and of course you want to
fill<00:03:51.700> the<00:03:51.820> jar<00:03:52.030> so<00:03:52.060> I'll<00:03:52.330> put<00:03:52.510> the<00:03:52.600> rest<00:03:52.810> of<00:03:52.930> the

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
fill the jar so I'll put the rest of the

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:58.520 
fill the jar so I'll put the rest of the
rice<00:03:53.200> into<00:03:53.620> it<00:03:53.740> all<00:03:53.890> the<00:03:54.010> way<00:03:54.130> to<00:03:54.190> the<00:03:54.430> top

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.440 

and<00:03:59.530> then<00:03:59.980> after<00:04:00.400> that<00:04:00.520> just<00:04:00.790> threw<00:04:01.090> off<00:04:01.239> the

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
and then after that just threw off the

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.270 
and then after that just threw off the
cap<00:04:01.660> and<00:04:01.959> you're<00:04:02.290> probably<00:04:02.500> going<00:04:02.800> to<00:04:02.890> want<00:04:03.130> to

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
cap and you're probably going to want to

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.220 
cap and you're probably going to want to
add<00:04:03.400> a<00:04:03.430> tank<00:04:03.849> because<00:04:04.030> he<00:04:04.420> probably<00:04:04.810> won't

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
add a tank because he probably won't

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.890 
add a tank because he probably won't
know<00:04:05.440> what<00:04:05.680> the<00:04:05.980> heck<00:04:06.160> this<00:04:06.400> is<00:04:06.459> and<00:04:06.910> really

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
know what the heck this is and really

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.510 
know what the heck this is and really
it's<00:04:08.080> just<00:04:08.170> representing<00:04:08.920> that<00:04:09.040> he's<00:04:09.280> one<00:04:09.489> in

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.520 
it's just representing that he's one in

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.110 
it's just representing that he's one in
a<00:04:09.730> million

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
a million

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.059 
a million
so<00:04:10.330> he's<00:04:10.540> that<00:04:10.750> little<00:04:11.200> grain<00:04:11.470> of<00:04:11.500> rice<00:04:11.680> or

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 
so he's that little grain of rice or

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:15.809 
so he's that little grain of rice or
that<00:04:12.280> little<00:04:12.610> thing<00:04:12.790> that<00:04:12.819> stands<00:04:13.209> out<00:04:14.819> cheese

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
that little thing that stands out cheese

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:17.729 
that little thing that stands out cheese
me<00:04:16.030> I<00:04:16.060> know<00:04:16.269> but<00:04:16.600> it's<00:04:17.019> really<00:04:17.260> last<00:04:17.590> minute

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
me I know but it's really last minute

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.800 
me I know but it's really last minute
and<00:04:18.040> you<00:04:18.100> really<00:04:18.609> don't<00:04:18.880> have<00:04:19.090> anything<00:04:19.480> else

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
and you really don't have anything else

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.780 
and you really don't have anything else
this<00:04:20.320> is<00:04:20.380> probably<00:04:20.950> a<00:04:21.010> good<00:04:21.220> idea

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
this is probably a good idea

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.670 
this is probably a good idea
rayko<00:04:22.300> panels<00:04:22.690> ahead<00:04:22.930> of<00:04:23.050> time<00:04:23.230> if<00:04:23.380> he<00:04:23.500> had

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
rayko panels ahead of time if he had

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.530 
rayko panels ahead of time if he had
chocolate<00:04:23.950> that's<00:04:24.490> what<00:04:24.700> it<00:04:24.820> did<00:04:24.940> last<00:04:25.000> time<00:04:25.300> I

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
chocolate that's what it did last time I

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.780 
chocolate that's what it did last time I
use<00:04:25.720> chocolate<00:04:26.650> covered<00:04:27.010> almonds<00:04:27.430> and<00:04:27.700> then

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
use chocolate covered almonds and then

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.550 
use chocolate covered almonds and then
for<00:04:28.240> the<00:04:28.360> one<00:04:28.510> that<00:04:28.690> stood<00:04:28.870> out<00:04:28.990> I<00:04:29.050> use<00:04:29.410> the

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
for the one that stood out I use the

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.290 
for the one that stood out I use the
yogurt<00:04:29.919> covered<00:04:30.190> one<00:04:30.580> and<00:04:30.820> I<00:04:30.880> just<00:04:30.910> drew<00:04:31.240> a

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
yogurt covered one and I just drew a

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.530 
yogurt covered one and I just drew a
little<00:04:31.540> hard<00:04:31.720> onto<00:04:31.870> it<00:04:32.910> alright<00:04:33.910> so<00:04:34.150> that's<00:04:34.330> it

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
little hard onto it alright so that's it

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.350
