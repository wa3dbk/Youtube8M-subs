your I don't know what's called there's

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:03.200 
your I don't know what's called there's
like<00:01:56.570> power<00:01:57.570> saver<00:01:58.219> like<00:02:01.100> Max<00:02:02.100> FPS<00:02:02.850> and

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
like power saver like Max FPS and

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.330 
like power saver like Max FPS and
something<00:02:03.960> else<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.200> forget<00:02:04.409> work<00:02:04.560> scope<00:02:04.799> so

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
something else I forget work scope so

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.340 
something else I forget work scope so
it's<00:02:06.149> normally<00:02:06.509> either<00:02:06.689> i<00:02:06.810> think<00:02:07.140> it's<00:02:07.229> like

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
it's normally either i think it's like

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.100 
it's normally either i think it's like
zero<00:02:07.799> or<00:02:08.099> one<00:02:08.670> or<00:02:08.989> two<00:02:09.989> I<00:02:10.020> think<00:02:10.440> so

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
zero or one or two I think so

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.430 
zero or one or two I think so
so<00:02:13.120> but<00:02:14.120> that<00:02:14.360> actually<00:02:14.660> increases<00:02:15.320> your

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
so but that actually increases your

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.650 
so but that actually increases your
total<00:02:15.500> frame<00:02:16.100> rate<00:02:16.310> you<00:02:16.430> can<00:02:16.490> get<00:02:16.820> I<00:02:17.060> mean<00:02:17.450> it

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
total frame rate you can get I mean it

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.930 
total frame rate you can get I mean it
lowers<00:02:18.230> our<00:02:18.410> all<00:02:18.650> your<00:02:18.860> other<00:02:19.040> frame<00:02:19.400> rate<00:02:19.610> to

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
lowers our all your other frame rate to

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.270 
lowers our all your other frame rate to
work<00:02:20.330> with<00:02:20.600> it<00:02:20.840> so<00:02:21.560> what<00:02:21.920> you're<00:02:22.040> going<00:02:22.160> to

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
work with it so what you're going to

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.530 
work with it so what you're going to
want<00:02:22.370> to<00:02:22.460> do<00:02:22.610> here<00:02:22.940> is<00:02:23.000> you're<00:02:23.240> going<00:02:23.360> to<00:02:23.420> want

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
want to do here is you're going to want

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.020 
want to do here is you're going to want
to<00:02:23.660> type<00:02:23.870> in<00:02:24.110> well<00:02:24.800> this<00:02:25.160> does<00:02:25.430> take<00:02:25.670> up<00:02:25.700> a<00:02:25.910> lot

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
to type in well this does take up a lot

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.060 
to type in well this does take up a lot
of<00:02:26.090> Java<00:02:26.420> memory<00:02:26.900> so<00:02:27.170> if<00:02:27.410> you<00:02:27.590> don't<00:02:27.680> have<00:02:27.860> much

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
of Java memory so if you don't have much

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.710 
of Java memory so if you don't have much
RAM<00:02:28.370> on<00:02:28.400> your<00:02:28.700> computer<00:02:29.060> i<00:02:29.090> don't<00:02:29.390> recommend

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
RAM on your computer i don't recommend

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.410 
RAM on your computer i don't recommend
using<00:02:29.990> this<00:02:30.170> but<00:02:30.710> um<00:02:31.030> you're<00:02:32.030> going<00:02:32.210> to<00:02:32.270> want

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
using this but um you're going to want

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.400 
using this but um you're going to want
to<00:02:32.480> type<00:02:32.660> in<00:02:32.840> a<00:02:33.080> different<00:02:33.890> number<00:02:34.100> other<00:02:34.280> than

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
to type in a different number other than

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
to type in a different number other than
10<00:02:36.410> or<00:02:36.680> coops<00:02:37.310> 20<00:02:38.470> i<00:02:39.470> personally<00:02:39.830> like<00:02:40.190> to<00:02:40.220> run

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
10 or coops 20 i personally like to run

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.160 
10 or coops 20 i personally like to run
with<00:02:40.459> 60<00:02:41.060> because<00:02:41.300> that<00:02:41.480> seems<00:02:41.690> to<00:02:41.840> get<00:02:41.959> me<00:02:42.050> the

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
with 60 because that seems to get me the

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.810 
with 60 because that seems to get me the
best<00:02:42.320> frame<00:02:42.590> rate<00:02:44.050> you<00:02:45.050> can<00:02:45.080> run<00:02:45.410> with<00:02:45.650> 30<00:02:46.550> if

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
best frame rate you can run with 30 if

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.020 
best frame rate you can run with 30 if
you<00:02:47.150> don't<00:02:47.330> have<00:02:47.450> much<00:02:47.810> RAM<00:02:48.110> and<00:02:48.800> I<00:02:49.100> filter<00:02:49.340> 30

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
you don't have much RAM and I filter 30

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.449 
you don't have much RAM and I filter 30
or<00:02:50.720> you<00:02:50.900> can<00:02:51.020> even<00:02:51.170> under<00:02:51.470> 15<00:02:51.860> just<00:02:52.100> remember

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
or you can even under 15 just remember

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.550 
or you can even under 15 just remember
the<00:02:52.640> lower<00:02:52.820> number<00:02:53.209> it<00:02:53.450> is<00:02:53.600> glass<00:02:54.230> frame<00:02:54.440> rate

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
the lower number it is glass frame rate

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.690 
the lower number it is glass frame rate
you're<00:02:54.680> going<00:02:54.709> to<00:02:54.860> get<00:02:55.010> so<00:02:55.370> I<00:02:55.400> hope<00:02:55.550> you

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
you're going to get so I hope you
