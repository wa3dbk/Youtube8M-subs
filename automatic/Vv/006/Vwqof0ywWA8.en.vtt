hi there welcome back to lesson 10 in
this<00:00:08.639> lesson<00:00:08.880> I'm<00:00:09.090> going<00:00:09.210> to<00:00:09.269> be<00:00:09.389> showing<00:00:09.630> you

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
this lesson I'm going to be showing you

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.770 
this lesson I'm going to be showing you
how<00:00:10.050> to<00:00:10.080> export<00:00:10.679> your<00:00:10.980> map<00:00:11.250> from<00:00:11.460> kuja's<00:00:12.030> as<00:00:12.269> an

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
how to export your map from kuja's as an

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.410 
how to export your map from kuja's as an
SVG<00:00:13.139> so<00:00:13.769> you<00:00:13.860> can<00:00:14.040> then<00:00:14.219> open<00:00:14.490> it<00:00:14.610> in<00:00:14.759> a<00:00:14.790> vector

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
SVG so you can then open it in a vector

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.260 
SVG so you can then open it in a vector
editing<00:00:15.719> program<00:00:16.139> like<00:00:16.289> illustrator<00:00:17.270> before

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
editing program like illustrator before

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.300 
editing program like illustrator before
I<00:00:18.300> do<00:00:18.390> that<00:00:18.510> I<00:00:18.810> want<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.230> add<00:00:19.410> in<00:00:19.590> some<00:00:19.619> state

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
I do that I want to add in some state

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.550 
I do that I want to add in some state
labels<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.270> these<00:00:21.480> four<00:00:21.960> states<00:00:22.260> that<00:00:22.470> we

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
labels to these four states that we

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.620 
labels to these four states that we
added<00:00:22.710> in<00:00:22.920> earlier<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.699> also<00:00:23.910> adding<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.420> C

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
added in earlier and also adding a C

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.080 
added in earlier and also adding a C
color<00:00:24.900> which<00:00:25.170> we<00:00:25.289> haven't<00:00:25.500> got<00:00:25.650> yet<00:00:25.859> so<00:00:26.730> in

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
color which we haven't got yet so in

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.790 
color which we haven't got yet so in
order<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.330> do<00:00:27.480> that<00:00:27.689> just<00:00:28.109> double<00:00:28.500> click<00:00:28.680> on

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
order to do that just double click on

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.229 
order to do that just double click on
the<00:00:28.949> state<00:00:29.130> polygon<00:00:29.640> layer<00:00:30.170> go<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.199> labels

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
the state polygon layer go to labels

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.119 
the state polygon layer go to labels
label<00:00:33.239> this<00:00:33.360> layer<00:00:33.600> width<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.760> choose<00:00:35.760> name

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 
label this layer width and choose name

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:45.490 
label this layer width and choose name
I'm<00:00:38.129> going<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.399> use<00:00:38.579> Arial<00:00:41.180> my<00:00:42.180> font<00:00:43.430> and

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
I'm going to use Arial my font and

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.940 
I'm going to use Arial my font and
regular<00:00:47.870> 11<00:00:48.870> points<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.440> I'm<00:00:49.620> just<00:00:49.770> going<00:00:49.920> to

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
regular 11 points and I'm just going to

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.950 
regular 11 points and I'm just going to
do<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.250> gray<00:00:50.579> instead<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.180> blank<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:51.840> it

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
do it a gray instead of a blank so it

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.560 
do it a gray instead of a blank so it
doesn't<00:00:52.260> clash<00:00:52.559> with<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:53.100> other<00:00:53.480> labels<00:00:54.480> on

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
doesn't clash with that other labels on

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.209 
doesn't clash with that other labels on
our<00:00:54.600> map<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.649> change<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.699> all<00:00:57.030> application

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
our map and change it to all application

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:01.819 
our map and change it to all application
let's<00:00:59.219> apply<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.879> there<00:01:00.780> we<00:01:00.870> go<00:01:00.899> now<00:01:01.620> what

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
let's apply that there we go now what

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.520 
let's apply that there we go now what
it's<00:01:01.980> done<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.520> it's<00:01:03.390> placed<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:04.140> let's<00:01:04.350> check

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
it's done is it's placed it let's check

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.320 
it's done is it's placed it let's check
this<00:01:04.650> placement<00:01:04.890> fun<00:01:05.280> here<00:01:05.549> offset<00:01:06.180> from

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
this placement fun here offset from

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.179 
this placement fun here offset from
centroid<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.290> what<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.530> basically<00:01:07.770> means<00:01:07.950> is

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
centroid so what that basically means is

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.380 
centroid so what that basically means is
it's<00:01:08.369> going<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.580> try<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:08.760> place<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.240> around

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
it's going to try and place it around

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.100 
it's going to try and place it around
the<00:01:09.720> middle<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.409> polygon<00:01:10.860> for<00:01:11.520> each<00:01:11.610> state

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
the middle of the polygon for each state

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.450 
the middle of the polygon for each state
obviously<00:01:13.110> we've<00:01:13.320> got<00:01:13.350> some<00:01:13.500> town<00:01:13.890> names<00:01:14.189> here

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
obviously we've got some town names here

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.340 
obviously we've got some town names here
as<00:01:14.610> well<00:01:14.790> which<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.030> clashing<00:01:15.630> with<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:16.200> in

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
as well which is clashing with so in

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.320 
as well which is clashing with so in
order<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.590> move<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:16.950> away<00:01:17.520> use<00:01:18.150> the

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
order to move that away use the

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.560 
order to move that away use the
horizontal<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.490> it<00:01:20.490> will<00:01:20.759> basically

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
horizontal and it will basically

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.380 
horizontal and it will basically
position<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.470> anywhere<00:01:22.820> inside<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.939> polygon

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
position it anywhere inside the polygon

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.820 
position it anywhere inside the polygon
and<00:01:24.570> you're<00:01:24.900> trying<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.200> avoid<00:01:25.350> clashing

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
and you're trying to avoid clashing

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.530 
and you're trying to avoid clashing
where<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.100> can<00:01:26.310> obviously<00:01:27.119> have<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.270> small

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
where it can obviously have a small

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.499 
where it can obviously have a small
state<00:01:27.810> like<00:01:27.840> Cabala<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.770> can't<00:01:29.009> do<00:01:29.220> that

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
state like Cabala it can't do that

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.390 
state like Cabala it can't do that
also<00:01:31.140> what<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.409> should<00:01:31.650> do<00:01:31.829> when<00:01:32.250> you're

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
also what you should do when you're

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.450 
also what you should do when you're
doing<00:01:32.729> your<00:01:32.759> label<00:01:33.329> rendering<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:34.250> go<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.310> the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
doing your label rendering is go to the

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.249 
doing your label rendering is go to the
windowing<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.060> always<00:01:36.450> check<00:01:36.780> this<00:01:36.930> button

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
windowing and always check this button

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.560 
windowing and always check this button
here<00:01:37.500> or<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.159> basically<00:01:38.759> means<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.420> will

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
here or that basically means is it will

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.460 
here or that basically means is it will
show<00:01:40.369> labels<00:01:41.369> even<00:01:41.880> if<00:01:42.240> they<00:01:42.360> overlap<00:01:42.659> another

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
show labels even if they overlap another

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.550 
show labels even if they overlap another
label<00:01:44.240> otherwise<00:01:45.240> sometimes<00:01:45.750> you'll<00:01:46.020> export

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
label otherwise sometimes you'll export

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.740 
label otherwise sometimes you'll export
your<00:01:46.649> map<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.130> go<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.670> you'll<00:01:48.090> see<00:01:48.329> that<00:01:48.479> some

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
your map and go and you'll see that some

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.810 
your map and go and you'll see that some
of<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.869> labels<00:01:49.140> have<00:01:49.229> disappeared<00:01:49.680> it's<00:01:50.640> done

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
of the labels have disappeared it's done

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.969 
of the labels have disappeared it's done
that<00:01:50.970> because<00:01:51.119> it's<00:01:51.689> chooses<00:01:52.350> try<00:01:52.560> not<00:01:52.770> to

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
that because it's chooses try not to

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.660 
that because it's chooses try not to
make<00:01:53.549> labels<00:01:53.820> clash<00:01:54.329> so<00:01:55.259> always<00:01:56.250> check<00:01:56.430> that

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
make labels clash so always check that

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.490 
make labels clash so always check that
button<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.329> make<00:01:57.479> sure<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:57.840> all<00:01:57.990> your<00:01:58.020> labels

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
button to make sure that all your labels

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.580 
button to make sure that all your labels
that<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.680> want<00:01:58.890> on<00:01:59.040> there<00:01:59.189> will<00:01:59.399> be<00:01:59.520> visible

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
that you want on there will be visible

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.870 
that you want on there will be visible
okay<00:02:01.590> so<00:02:01.920> I'm<00:02:02.009> going<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.159> also<00:02:02.399> do<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:02.790> with

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
okay so I'm going to also do that with

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.940 
okay so I'm going to also do that with
my<00:02:02.969> country<00:02:03.210> polygons<00:02:03.869> just<00:02:04.200> in<00:02:04.350> case<00:02:04.590> the

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
my country polygons just in case the

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.150 
my country polygons just in case the
Iraq<00:02:05.340> label<00:02:06.329> gets<00:02:06.780> turned<00:02:07.380> off<00:02:07.560> because<00:02:08.039> of

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
Iraq label gets turned off because of

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.300 
Iraq label gets turned off because of
its<00:02:08.280> proximity<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.420> other<00:02:09.629> towns<00:02:09.929> here<00:02:10.310> so

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
its proximity to the other towns here so

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.750 
its proximity to the other towns here so
we'll<00:02:11.430> okay<00:02:11.760> that

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
we'll okay that

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.479 
we'll okay that

now I just want to ride in the sea Carl

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.520 
now I just want to ride in the sea Carl
I<00:02:15.580> know<00:02:15.760> in<00:02:15.819> order<00:02:15.970> to<00:02:16.150> do<00:02:16.330> that<00:02:16.569> just<00:02:17.080> go<00:02:17.500> to

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
I know in order to do that just go to

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.160 
I know in order to do that just go to
your<00:02:17.860> project<00:02:18.489> properties<00:02:19.269> which<00:02:19.659> is<00:02:19.840> command

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
your project properties which is command

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.210 
your project properties which is command
shift<00:02:20.799> P<00:02:21.250> and<00:02:22.680> what<00:02:23.680> we're<00:02:23.830> going<00:02:23.920> to<00:02:23.980> change

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
shift P and what we're going to change

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.070 
shift P and what we're going to change
is<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.370> background<00:02:24.640> color<00:02:24.940> which<00:02:25.480> is<00:02:25.690> what<00:02:25.900> is

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
is the background color which is what is

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.199 
is the background color which is what is

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
that your map is going to export our now

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.759 
that your map is going to export our now
if<00:03:03.099> you<00:03:03.220> have<00:03:03.430> a<00:03:03.459> size<00:03:04.120> it<00:03:04.329> use<00:03:04.569> regularly<00:03:05.049> then

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
if you have a size it use regularly then

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.319 
if you have a size it use regularly then
it's<00:03:05.980> a<00:03:06.069> good<00:03:06.190> idea<00:03:06.340> to<00:03:06.609> make<00:03:06.760> a<00:03:06.790> template<00:03:07.299> of

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
it's a good idea to make a template of

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.860 
it's a good idea to make a template of
it<00:03:07.660> so<00:03:08.079> to<00:03:08.140> do<00:03:08.590> that<00:03:08.620> change<00:03:09.609> it<00:03:09.700> to<00:03:09.790> custom<00:03:09.940> I'm

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
it so to do that change it to custom I'm

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.550 
it so to do that change it to custom I'm
going<00:03:11.170> to<00:03:11.230> do<00:03:11.379> a<00:03:11.670> 300<00:03:12.670> pixel<00:03:13.260> template<00:03:14.260> which<00:03:14.410> I

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
going to do a 300 pixel template which I

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.890 
going to do a 300 pixel template which I
know<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:15.700> previous<00:03:16.030> experience<00:03:16.510> is<00:03:16.720> one

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
know the previous experience is one

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:17.930 
know the previous experience is one
hundred<00:03:17.109> and<00:03:17.200> six<00:03:17.380> millimeters

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
hundred and six millimeters

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.099 
hundred and six millimeters
unfortunately<00:03:18.940> doesn't<00:03:19.090> have<00:03:19.209> pixels<00:03:19.690> here

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
unfortunately doesn't have pixels here

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:21.750 
unfortunately doesn't have pixels here
as<00:03:20.319> an<00:03:20.440> option<00:03:20.799> so<00:03:21.010> you<00:03:21.069> basically<00:03:21.280> need<00:03:21.639> to

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
as an option so you basically need to

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.509 
as an option so you basically need to
convert<00:03:22.120> from<00:03:22.480> pixels<00:03:22.900> to<00:03:23.049> millimeters<00:03:23.530> so

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
convert from pixels to millimeters so

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.289 
convert from pixels to millimeters so
and<00:03:25.090> I'm<00:03:25.209> going<00:03:25.359> to<00:03:25.389> do<00:03:25.480> as<00:03:25.569> a<00:03:25.599> web<00:03:26.430> map<00:03:27.430> so<00:03:27.880> the

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
and I'm going to do as a web map so the

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:32.879 
and I'm going to do as a web map so the
exporter<00:03:28.720> solution<00:03:29.079> will<00:03:29.169> be<00:03:29.230> 72<00:03:29.680> dpi<00:03:30.160> and<00:03:31.889> I

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
exporter solution will be 72 dpi and I

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:33.780 
exporter solution will be 72 dpi and I
was<00:03:32.980> going<00:03:33.099> to<00:03:33.160> click<00:03:33.340> this<00:03:33.430> one-to-one

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
was going to click this one-to-one

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.460 
was going to click this one-to-one
button<00:03:34.180> so<00:03:34.419> that's<00:03:34.510> going<00:03:34.690> to<00:03:34.750> be<00:03:34.840> the<00:03:34.959> size<00:03:35.169> of

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
button so that's going to be the size of

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.069 
button so that's going to be the size of
my<00:03:35.769> Mac<00:03:36.010> now<00:03:36.940> in<00:03:37.209> order<00:03:37.359> to<00:03:37.450> get<00:03:37.569> your<00:03:37.660> map<00:03:37.870> in

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
having trouble positioning the map

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.440 
having trouble positioning the map
correctly<00:04:04.720> so<00:04:05.530> always<00:04:05.889> recommend<00:04:06.459> making

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
correctly so always recommend making

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.589 
correctly so always recommend making
this<00:04:07.750> window<00:04:08.200> the<00:04:08.769> same<00:04:09.069> ratio<00:04:09.669> as<00:04:10.030> your<00:04:10.299> print

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:10.599 
this window the same ratio as your print

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.020 
this window the same ratio as your print
composer<00:04:10.810> window<00:04:11.310> so<00:04:12.310> we've<00:04:12.639> got<00:04:12.760> a<00:04:12.790> square

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
composer window so we've got a square

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.390 
composer window so we've got a square
map<00:04:13.329> here<00:04:13.629> so<00:04:13.870> have<00:04:14.319> a<00:04:14.349> square<00:04:14.709> map<00:04:14.889> here<00:04:15.129> so

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
map here so have a square map here so

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.140 
map here so have a square map here so
I'm<00:04:15.459> just<00:04:15.579> going<00:04:15.730> to<00:04:15.760> zoom<00:04:15.970> in<00:04:16.180> to<00:04:17.789> Iraq<00:04:18.789> so

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
I'm just going to zoom in to Iraq so

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.440 
I'm just going to zoom in to Iraq so
it's<00:04:19.299> a<00:04:19.329> lot<00:04:19.479> tighter<00:04:20.789> so<00:04:21.789> that's<00:04:22.210> roughly

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
it's a lot tighter so that's roughly

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.089 
it's a lot tighter so that's roughly
what<00:04:22.750> I<00:04:22.780> wanted<00:04:22.990> to<00:04:23.110> look<00:04:23.260> like<00:04:23.469> when<00:04:23.620> I<00:04:23.650> export

00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:24.099 
what I wanted to look like when I export

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:25.800 
what I wanted to look like when I export
it<00:04:24.250> so<00:04:24.490> in<00:04:24.880> order<00:04:24.969> to<00:04:25.150> get<00:04:25.300> that<00:04:25.419> for<00:04:25.599> you<00:04:25.690> in

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
it so in order to get that for you in

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:26.490 
it so in order to get that for you in
here<00:04:26.020> I<00:04:26.050> suppose

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
here I suppose

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.730 
here I suppose
simple<00:04:26.910> go-to<00:04:27.910> item<00:04:28.180> properties<00:04:28.540> and<00:04:29.230> then

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
simple go-to item properties and then

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.480 
simple go-to item properties and then
set<00:04:30.280> to<00:04:30.490> map<00:04:30.670> canvas<00:04:31.120> extent<00:04:31.980> there<00:04:32.980> we<00:04:33.070> go<00:04:33.220> so

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
set to map canvas extent there we go so

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.860 
set to map canvas extent there we go so
now<00:04:33.520> that's<00:04:33.790> basically<00:04:34.240> trying<00:04:34.540> to<00:04:34.660> replicate

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
now that's basically trying to replicate

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.640 
now that's basically trying to replicate
your<00:04:35.530> view<00:04:35.770> here<00:04:36.070> in<00:04:36.370> your<00:04:36.760> print<00:04:37.000> composer

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
your view here in your print composer

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.640 
your view here in your print composer
now<00:04:38.650> now<00:04:39.430> I've<00:04:39.640> created<00:04:39.820> this<00:04:40.470> template<00:04:41.470> I'm

going to save it so I can use it for

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.300 
going to save it so I can use it for
future<00:04:43.360> times<00:04:43.750> so<00:04:44.530> in<00:04:44.620> order<00:04:44.740> to<00:04:44.830> do<00:04:44.950> that<00:04:45.100> very

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
and I'm going to call it C rank I've

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.830 
and I'm going to call it C rank I've
already<00:05:24.790> got<00:05:24.910> one<00:05:24.940> here<00:05:25.270> earlier<00:05:25.570> so<00:05:25.690> I'm<00:05:25.750> just

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
already got one here earlier so I'm just

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.510 
already got one here earlier so I'm just
going<00:05:25.960> to<00:05:26.050> replace<00:05:26.260> that<00:05:26.380> one<00:05:27.660> okay<00:05:28.660> that<00:05:28.690> and

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
going to replace that one okay that and

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.350 
going to replace that one okay that and
then<00:05:30.520> switch<00:05:30.970> to<00:05:31.000> illustrator<00:05:31.890> and<00:05:33.240> then<00:05:34.240> I'm

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
then switch to illustrator and then I'm

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.290 
then switch to illustrator and then I'm
just<00:05:34.390> going<00:05:34.570> to<00:05:34.660> open<00:05:34.720> it<00:05:35.640> so<00:05:36.640> on<00:05:36.700> the<00:05:36.790> desktop

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
just going to open it so on the desktop

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.790 
just going to open it so on the desktop
your<00:05:37.960> back<00:05:38.169> map<00:05:38.500> and<00:05:40.200> there<00:05:41.200> it<00:05:41.350> is

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
your back map and there it is

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.250 
your back map and there it is
so<00:05:42.520> that's<00:05:42.820> exporting<00:05:43.540> your<00:05:43.660> map<00:05:43.900> out<00:05:44.200> of

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:44.260 
so that's exporting your map out of

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.880 
so that's exporting your map out of
cuties<00:05:45.190> and<00:05:45.400> into<00:05:46.210> illustrator<00:05:46.720> in<00:05:47.500> the<00:05:47.620> next

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:47.890 
cuties and into illustrator in the next

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:49.080 
cuties and into illustrator in the next
lesson<00:05:48.190> I'm<00:05:48.280> going<00:05:48.400> to<00:05:48.460> show<00:05:48.520> you<00:05:48.729> how<00:05:49.060> to

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090 
lesson I'm going to show you how to

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.540 
lesson I'm going to show you how to
fine-tune<00:05:49.780> the<00:05:50.410> positions<00:05:50.860> of<00:05:50.979> the<00:05:51.130> labels

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
fine-tune the positions of the labels

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.719 
fine-tune the positions of the labels
and<00:05:51.850> also<00:05:52.330> how<00:05:52.690> to<00:05:52.750> add<00:05:53.169> a<00:05:53.410> scale<00:05:53.979> onto<00:05:54.550> your

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:54.729 
and also how to add a scale onto your

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:57.760 
and also how to add a scale onto your
map
