00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.870 
garden art since I moved in with my
grandma<00:00:19.050> because<00:00:19.350> I<00:00:19.920> haven't<00:00:20.279> had<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.430> yard<00:00:20.730> in

grandma because I haven't had a yard in
a<00:00:20.970> long<00:00:21.150> time<00:00:21.420> so<00:00:21.869> I<00:00:22.109> started<00:00:22.710> saving<00:00:22.890> tin<00:00:23.400> can

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
a long time so I started saving tin can

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.269 
a long time so I started saving tin can
lids<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.390> just<00:00:25.380> kind<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.710> wanted<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:25.980> come<00:00:26.189> up

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
lids and just kind of wanted to come up

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.279 
lids and just kind of wanted to come up
with<00:00:26.400> something<00:00:26.609> with<00:00:26.849> reclaimed<00:00:27.240> items<00:00:27.779> so

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
with something with reclaimed items so

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.950 
with something with reclaimed items so
the<00:00:28.410> sculpture<00:00:28.769> behind<00:00:29.099> me<00:00:29.279> is<00:00:29.630> is<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.840> one

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
the sculpture behind me is is the one

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.020 
the sculpture behind me is is the one
that<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.109> came<00:00:31.199> up<00:00:31.560> with<00:00:31.590> I<00:00:31.949> knew<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:32.579> wanted<00:00:32.820> to

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
that I came up with I knew I wanted to

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.959 
that I came up with I knew I wanted to
make<00:00:33.180> my<00:00:33.390> garden<00:00:34.380> art<00:00:34.800> out<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.070> reclaimed

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
make my garden art out of reclaimed

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.900 
make my garden art out of reclaimed
items<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.170> started<00:00:37.860> by<00:00:37.980> finding<00:00:38.430> some<00:00:38.670> old

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
items so I started by finding some old

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.990 
items so I started by finding some old
barn<00:00:39.300> wood<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:40.230> then<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.800> gathered<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.340> tin

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
barn wood and then I gathered that tin

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.450 
barn wood and then I gathered that tin
can<00:00:42.030> lids<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:42.899> had<00:00:43.110> been<00:00:43.460> collecting

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
can lids that I had been collecting

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.639 
can lids that I had been collecting
throughout<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.969> year<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.809> think<00:00:46.170> we<00:00:46.410> need

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
throughout the year and I think we need

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.619 
throughout the year and I think we need
to<00:00:46.770> eat<00:00:46.950> more<00:00:46.980> canned<00:00:47.489> foods<00:00:47.850> because<00:00:48.270> this<00:00:48.480> is

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
to eat more canned foods because this is

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.600 
to eat more canned foods because this is
all<00:00:48.780> we<00:00:48.899> had<00:00:49.079> after<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.530> year<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.250> was<00:00:50.370> barely

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
all we had after a year it was barely

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.540 
all we had after a year it was barely
enough<00:00:50.910> for<00:00:51.120> my<00:00:51.239> project<00:00:51.890> and<00:00:52.890> then<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.340> first

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
enough for my project and then the first

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.450 
enough for my project and then the first
thing<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.969> do<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.770> drill<00:00:55.770> holes<00:00:56.100> through

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
thing to do is to drill holes through

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.340 
thing to do is to drill holes through
the<00:00:56.579> center<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.090> them<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.930> just<00:00:57.960> took<00:00:58.289> a

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
the center of them and I just took a

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.020 
the center of them and I just took a
sharpie<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:58.859> marked<00:00:59.340> where<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.550> wanted<00:00:59.879> the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
sharpie and marked where I wanted the

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.500 
sharpie and marked where I wanted the
holes<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.449> be<00:01:00.859> clamped<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.430> tin<00:01:02.879> can<00:01:02.910> lids

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
holes to be clamped that tin can lids

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.679 
holes to be clamped that tin can lids
down<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.710> my<00:01:05.129> bench<00:01:05.400> with<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:06.030> little<00:01:06.360> piece<00:01:06.540> of

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
down to my bench with a little piece of

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.800 
down to my bench with a little piece of
plywood<00:01:06.960> in<00:01:07.439> between<00:01:08.159> my<00:01:08.310> bench<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.510> lid

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
plywood in between my bench and the lid

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.420 
plywood in between my bench and the lid
so<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.229> could<00:01:10.590> drill<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.010> hole<00:01:11.189> all<00:01:11.400> the

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
so that I could drill the hole all the

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.820 
so that I could drill the hole all the
way<00:01:11.549> through<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:12.299> one<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.439> things<00:01:13.680> I

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
way through and one of the things I

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.520 
way through and one of the things I
found<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:15.000> want<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.600> just<00:01:15.960> barely<00:01:16.229> go

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
found is that you want to just barely go

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.310 
found is that you want to just barely go
through<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.979> metal<00:01:17.820> lid<00:01:18.180> because<00:01:18.750> otherwise

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
through the metal lid because otherwise

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.840 
through the metal lid because otherwise
it<00:01:19.590> gives<00:01:19.860> kind<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.159> dangerous<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.610> starts

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
it gives kind of dangerous to starts

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.420 
it gives kind of dangerous to starts
flying<00:01:21.150> up<00:01:21.450> your<00:01:21.659> drill<00:01:22.200> bit<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.560> stuff<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:23.220> I

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
flying up your drill bit and stuff so I

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.999 
flying up your drill bit and stuff so I
found<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.060> just<00:01:24.090> go<00:01:24.390> slow<00:01:24.689> where<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.380> wanted<00:01:25.860> the

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
found it just go slow where I wanted the

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.580 
found it just go slow where I wanted the
lids<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.700> bend<00:01:27.000> around<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.780> edge<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.409> wood

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
lids to bend around the edge of the wood

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.219 
lids to bend around the edge of the wood
I<00:01:28.890> put<00:01:29.369> him<00:01:29.460> in<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.640> vise<00:01:29.850> grip<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.509> then<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:30.869> hat

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
I put him in a vise grip and then I hat

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.560 
I put him in a vise grip and then I hat
took<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.860> hammer<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.400> just<00:01:32.880> hammered<00:01:33.299> him<00:01:33.420> to

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
took a hammer and just hammered him to

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.840 
took a hammer and just hammered him to
the<00:01:33.689> side<00:01:33.930> so<00:01:34.560> that<00:01:34.740> they<00:01:34.860> got<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.189> 45<00:01:35.670> degree

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
the side so that they got that 45 degree

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.719 
the side so that they got that 45 degree
angle<00:01:36.420> so<00:01:36.829> then<00:01:37.829> I<00:01:37.860> wanted<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.250> figure<00:01:38.460> out

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
angle so then I wanted to figure out

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.520 
angle so then I wanted to figure out
what<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.360> do<00:01:39.479> with<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.689> second<00:01:40.079> half<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.380> my

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
what to do with the second half of my

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.520 
what to do with the second half of my
sculpture<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:42.450> went<00:01:42.960> into<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.350> backyard

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
sculpture so I went into the backyard

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.069 
sculpture so I went into the backyard
and<00:01:44.130> looked<00:01:44.670> around<00:01:44.850> for<00:01:45.509> old<00:01:46.079> metal<00:01:46.890> II<00:01:47.030> rusty

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
and looked around for old metal II rusty

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.020 
and looked around for old metal II rusty
interesting<00:01:49.079> looking<00:01:49.439> things<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.790> care

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
interesting looking things and I care

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
really

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.160 
really
for<00:02:14.280> instance<00:02:14.700> for<00:02:15.030> most<00:02:15.330> people<00:02:15.750> this<00:02:15.960> would

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
for instance for most people this would

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.170 
for instance for most people this would
probably<00:02:16.380> be<00:02:16.680> a<00:02:17.100> fire<00:02:17.370> screen<00:02:17.820> that's<00:02:18.030> what

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
probably be a fire screen that's what

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.990 
probably be a fire screen that's what
most<00:02:18.360> people<00:02:18.660> see<00:02:18.960> but<00:02:19.620> what<00:02:20.430> I<00:02:20.460> see<00:02:20.730> is<00:02:20.820> what

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
most people see but what I see is what

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.720 
most people see but what I see is what
it's<00:02:21.120> going<00:02:21.270> to<00:02:21.360> look<00:02:21.450> like<00:02:21.600> on<00:02:21.930> my<00:02:22.080> sculpture

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
it's going to look like on my sculpture

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.730 
it's going to look like on my sculpture
so<00:02:23.730> this<00:02:23.910> is<00:02:24.090> this<00:02:24.510> is<00:02:24.660> what<00:02:24.810> I<00:02:24.840> see<00:02:25.200> in<00:02:25.290> my<00:02:25.350> mind

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
so this is this is what I see in my mind

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.720 
so this is this is what I see in my mind
is<00:02:26.190> kind<00:02:26.880> of<00:02:26.940> a<00:02:27.030> grid<00:02:27.420> rusted<00:02:28.230> metal<00:02:28.260> II<00:02:28.830> just

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
is kind of a grid rusted metal II just

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.450 
is kind of a grid rusted metal II just
interesting<00:02:30.300> shapes<00:02:30.600> to<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:31.080> so<00:02:31.560> I<00:02:31.590> liked<00:02:32.160> it<00:02:32.280> I

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
interesting shapes to it so I liked it I

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.240 
interesting shapes to it so I liked it I
grabbed<00:02:32.850> it<00:02:33.000> and<00:02:33.060> took<00:02:33.270> it<00:02:33.420> with<00:02:33.570> me<00:02:33.720> I<00:02:34.250> wanted

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
grabbed it and took it with me I wanted

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.080 
grabbed it and took it with me I wanted
to<00:02:35.340> find<00:02:35.670> a<00:02:36.120> space<00:02:36.450> in<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.840> yard<00:02:37.170> that<00:02:38.090> it

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
to find a space in the yard that it

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.610 
to find a space in the yard that it
would<00:02:39.300> show<00:02:39.450> off<00:02:39.600> my<00:02:39.840> sculpture<00:02:40.260> but<00:02:40.470> it

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
would show off my sculpture but it

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.130 
would show off my sculpture but it
wouldn't<00:02:40.920> overpower<00:02:41.820> the<00:02:42.120> yard<00:02:42.360> so<00:02:42.870> I<00:02:42.900> chose

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
wouldn't overpower the yard so I chose

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.320 
wouldn't overpower the yard so I chose
the<00:02:43.350> spot<00:02:43.590> that's<00:02:43.890> between<00:02:44.220> a<00:02:44.340> tree<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:45.150> a

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
the spot that's between a tree and a

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.150 
the spot that's between a tree and a
bush<00:02:45.660> and<00:02:45.990> I'm<00:02:46.380> going<00:02:46.800> to<00:02:46.890> put<00:02:47.040> it<00:02:47.130> right

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
bush and I'm going to put it right

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.520 
bush and I'm going to put it right
behind<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:47.790> bush<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.330> that<00:02:48.360> way<00:02:48.930> when<00:02:49.140> when

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
behind the bush and that way when when

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.870 
behind the bush and that way when when
you're<00:02:49.650> driving<00:02:49.830> up<00:02:50.070> the<00:02:50.190> road<00:02:50.220> it<00:02:50.670> kind<00:02:50.820> of

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
you're driving up the road it kind of

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.030 
you're driving up the road it kind of
peeks<00:02:51.090> over<00:02:51.270> it<00:02:51.570> so<00:02:51.840> it's<00:02:52.020> it's<00:02:52.620> kind<00:02:52.920> of<00:02:52.950> a

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
peeks over it so it's it's kind of a

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.900 
peeks over it so it's it's kind of a
tease<00:02:53.250> I<00:02:53.550> guess<00:02:54.110> and<00:02:55.110> so<00:02:55.710> here<00:02:56.280> I'm<00:02:56.460> trying<00:02:56.670> to

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
tease I guess and so here I'm trying to

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.880 
tease I guess and so here I'm trying to
figure<00:02:57.330> out<00:02:57.360> what<00:02:57.660> I<00:02:57.690> want<00:02:57.960> to<00:02:58.020> do<00:02:58.290> with<00:02:58.770> the

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
figure out what I want to do with the

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.190 
figure out what I want to do with the
second<00:02:59.280> half<00:02:59.460> of<00:02:59.670> my<00:02:59.850> sculpture<00:03:00.420> and<00:03:00.900> I<00:03:00.990> took

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
second half of my sculpture and I took

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.040 
second half of my sculpture and I took
the<00:03:01.440> wider<00:03:01.830> pieces<00:03:02.250> of<00:03:02.670> barnwood<00:03:03.180> and<00:03:03.510> wrapped

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
the wider pieces of barnwood and wrapped

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.590 
the wider pieces of barnwood and wrapped
the<00:03:04.230> fencing<00:03:04.620> around<00:03:04.740> it<00:03:05.300> screwed<00:03:06.300> them<00:03:06.420> in

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
the fencing around it screwed them in

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.730 
the fencing around it screwed them in
again<00:03:06.960> with<00:03:07.110> some<00:03:07.290> washers<00:03:07.740> and<00:03:08.070> screws<00:03:08.130> and

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
again with some washers and screws and

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.430 
again with some washers and screws and
it<00:03:10.740> still<00:03:11.100> looked<00:03:11.340> a<00:03:11.460> little<00:03:11.580> bit<00:03:12.050> boring<00:03:13.050> to

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
it still looked a little bit boring to

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.620 
it still looked a little bit boring to
me<00:03:13.590> so<00:03:13.950> I<00:03:14.250> decided<00:03:14.640> I<00:03:15.090> wanted<00:03:15.330> to<00:03:15.390> add<00:03:15.600> a

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
me so I decided I wanted to add a

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.990 
me so I decided I wanted to add a
sunshine<00:03:16.290> underneath<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.130> underneath<00:03:17.760> the

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
sunshine underneath the underneath the

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.960 
sunshine underneath the underneath the
fencing<00:03:18.510> and<00:03:19.040> this<00:03:20.040> is<00:03:20.190> just<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.490> first<00:03:20.730> layer

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
fencing and this is just the first layer

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.420 
fencing and this is just the first layer
with<00:03:21.240> a<00:03:21.270> yellow<00:03:21.600> Sun<00:03:21.900> but<00:03:22.440> I'm<00:03:22.590> laying<00:03:22.860> that<00:03:23.190> it

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
with a yellow Sun but I'm laying that it

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.790 
with a yellow Sun but I'm laying that it
the<00:03:23.910> sculpture<00:03:24.510> out<00:03:24.690> with<00:03:25.260> some<00:03:25.440> rebar

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
the sculpture out with some rebar

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.360 
the sculpture out with some rebar
between<00:03:26.250> it<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:27.620> and<00:03:28.620> then<00:03:28.860> I'm<00:03:28.980> trying<00:03:29.280> to

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
between it and and then I'm trying to

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.940 
between it and and then I'm trying to
figure<00:03:29.550> out<00:03:29.850> how<00:03:30.150> to<00:03:30.320> put<00:03:31.320> it<00:03:31.410> into<00:03:31.650> the<00:03:31.740> ground

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
figure out how to put it into the ground

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.920 
figure out how to put it into the ground
because<00:03:32.310> it's<00:03:32.490> really<00:03:32.700> important<00:03:33.360> that<00:03:33.630> I

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
because it's really important that I

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.650 
because it's really important that I
have<00:03:34.230> everything<00:03:34.850> parallel<00:03:35.850> and<00:03:36.090> balanced

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
have everything parallel and balanced

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
have everything parallel and balanced
and<00:03:36.780> level<00:03:37.080> on<00:03:37.200> this<00:03:37.440> so<00:03:38.070> I<00:03:38.540> thought<00:03:39.540> that<00:03:40.440> I

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
and level on this so I thought that I

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.850 
and level on this so I thought that I
could<00:03:41.010> take<00:03:41.700> cardboard<00:03:42.270> boxes<00:03:42.840> bury<00:03:43.440> those<00:03:43.650> in

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
could take cardboard boxes bury those in

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.560 
could take cardboard boxes bury those in
the<00:03:43.980> ground<00:03:44.280> or<00:03:44.640> dig<00:03:44.820> those<00:03:44.940> into<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.270> ground

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
the ground or dig those into the ground

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.900 
the ground or dig those into the ground
and<00:03:45.960> which<00:03:46.860> is<00:03:46.980> what<00:03:47.130> I'm<00:03:47.250> starting<00:03:47.460> to<00:03:47.790> do

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
and which is what I'm starting to do

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.380 
and which is what I'm starting to do
here<00:03:48.540> and<00:03:48.750> then<00:03:49.700> I'd<00:03:50.700> have<00:03:50.730> to<00:03:51.030> have<00:03:51.150> something

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
here and then I'd have to have something

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.240 
here and then I'd have to have something
of<00:03:51.570> course<00:03:51.810> to<00:03:51.960> hold<00:03:52.170> up<00:03:52.320> the<00:03:52.470> boards<00:03:52.950> while<00:03:53.190> I

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
of course to hold up the boards while I

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.590 
of course to hold up the boards while I
got<00:03:54.120> the<00:03:54.240> concrete<00:03:54.720> to<00:03:54.900> set<00:03:56.150> but<00:03:57.150> I<00:03:57.180> want<00:03:57.510> to

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
got the concrete to set but I want to

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.050 
got the concrete to set but I want to
make<00:03:57.720> a<00:03:57.750> point<00:03:58.170> that<00:03:58.530> if<00:03:59.010> you<00:03:59.070> don't<00:03:59.550> know<00:03:59.940> how

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
make a point that if you don't know how

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.790 
make a point that if you don't know how
to<00:04:00.120> do<00:04:00.330> something<00:04:00.600> you<00:04:01.020> know<00:04:01.380> go<00:04:01.500> look<00:04:01.650> it<00:04:01.740> up

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
to do something you know go look it up

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.440 
to do something you know go look it up
online<00:04:02.010> or<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:02.550> biggest<00:04:02.880> thing<00:04:03.000> is<00:04:03.090> don't<00:04:03.360> be

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
online or the biggest thing is don't be

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.690 
online or the biggest thing is don't be
afraid<00:04:03.480> to<00:04:03.840> jump<00:04:04.080> in<00:04:04.260> and<00:04:04.410> start<00:04:04.680> it<00:04:04.860> because<00:04:05.100> I

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
afraid to jump in and start it because I

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.680 
afraid to jump in and start it because I
think<00:04:06.090> so<00:04:06.240> many<00:04:06.360> people<00:04:06.810> end<00:04:07.050> up<00:04:07.140> not<00:04:07.220> doing

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
think so many people end up not doing

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.210 
think so many people end up not doing
projects<00:04:09.690> because<00:04:10.110> they're<00:04:10.350> procrastinating

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
projects because they're procrastinating

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.650 
projects because they're procrastinating
because<00:04:11.400> they<00:04:11.550> want<00:04:11.760> to<00:04:11.880> know<00:04:11.970> exactly<00:04:12.060> how<00:04:12.540> to

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
because they want to know exactly how to

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.720 
because they want to know exactly how to
do<00:04:12.900> it<00:04:12.930> right<00:04:13.230> and<00:04:13.500> sometimes<00:04:14.190> it's<00:04:14.459> just<00:04:14.520> so

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
do it right and sometimes it's just so

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.330 
do it right and sometimes it's just so
much<00:04:14.850> more<00:04:15.060> fun<00:04:15.120> to<00:04:15.480> jump<00:04:15.690> in<00:04:15.900> and<00:04:16.380> I<00:04:16.980> find<00:04:17.160> that

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
much more fun to jump in and I find that

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.430 
much more fun to jump in and I find that
I<00:04:17.400> do<00:04:17.520> that<00:04:17.760> often<00:04:18.120> I<00:04:18.270> jump<00:04:18.810> in<00:04:18.989> and<00:04:19.020> try<00:04:19.380> to

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
I do that often I jump in and try to

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.320 
I do that often I jump in and try to
figure<00:04:19.680> something<00:04:20.160> out<00:04:20.280> and<00:04:20.340> I<00:04:20.940> come<00:04:21.150> up<00:04:21.270> with

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
figure something out and I come up with

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.510 
figure something out and I come up with
more<00:04:21.600> creative<00:04:21.810> ideas<00:04:22.169> by<00:04:22.620> doing<00:04:22.950> that<00:04:23.100> but

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
more creative ideas by doing that but

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
more creative ideas by doing that but
then<00:04:23.790> I<00:04:24.030> also<00:04:24.570> end<00:04:25.020> up<00:04:25.169> going<00:04:25.500> back<00:04:25.650> and<00:04:25.979> read

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
then I also end up going back and read

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.290 
then I also end up going back and read
doing<00:04:26.870> in<00:04:27.050> thus<00:04:27.410> the<00:04:27.710> new<00:04:28.250> picture<00:04:28.640> here<00:04:28.940> with

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
doing in thus the new picture here with

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.380 
doing in thus the new picture here with
the<00:04:29.600> wood<00:04:29.840> on<00:04:29.870> the<00:04:30.170> side<00:04:30.380> because<00:04:31.250> just<00:04:32.210> about

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
the wood on the side because just about

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.060 
the wood on the side because just about
the<00:04:32.630> time<00:04:32.840> I<00:04:32.870> got<00:04:33.230> the<00:04:33.410> cardboard<00:04:33.860> in<00:04:33.980> the

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
the time I got the cardboard in the

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.610 
the time I got the cardboard in the
ground<00:04:34.310> my<00:04:34.640> mom<00:04:35.020> sped<00:04:36.020> up<00:04:36.170> in<00:04:36.350> her<00:04:36.500> little

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
ground my mom sped up in her little

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.810 
ground my mom sped up in her little
Miata<00:04:37.040> jumped<00:04:38.030> out<00:04:38.240> and<00:04:38.660> said<00:04:39.260> umm<00:04:39.640> kami<00:04:40.640> I

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
Miata jumped out and said umm kami I

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.420 
Miata jumped out and said umm kami I
don't<00:04:41.600> think<00:04:42.200> that<00:04:42.440> cardboard<00:04:42.770> is<00:04:43.070> actually

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
don't think that cardboard is actually

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.170 
don't think that cardboard is actually
going<00:04:43.580> to<00:04:43.790> hold<00:04:44.000> your<00:04:44.210> concrete<00:04:44.810> in<00:04:45.160> so<00:04:46.160> I<00:04:46.760> had

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
going to hold your concrete in so I had

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.410 
going to hold your concrete in so I had
to<00:04:47.360> redo<00:04:47.570> it<00:04:47.810> but<00:04:48.620> so<00:04:49.520> I<00:04:49.550> found<00:04:49.850> some<00:04:50.090> plywood

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:50.420 
to redo it but so I found some plywood

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.750 
to redo it but so I found some plywood
with<00:04:50.750> flowers<00:04:51.110> on<00:04:51.230> it<00:04:51.290> no<00:04:51.530> less<00:04:51.740> in<00:04:52.010> the<00:04:52.280> garage

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
with flowers on it no less in the garage

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.690 
with flowers on it no less in the garage
and<00:04:53.060> built<00:04:53.420> an<00:04:53.690> actual<00:04:53.900> plywood<00:04:54.470> box<00:04:54.830> and<00:04:55.550> then

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
and built an actual plywood box and then

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.520 
and built an actual plywood box and then
I<00:04:55.820> started<00:04:56.150> trying<00:04:56.420> to<00:04:56.570> figure<00:04:56.840> out<00:04:57.170> how<00:04:57.470> to

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
I started trying to figure out how to

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.910 
I started trying to figure out how to
get<00:04:58.220> the<00:04:59.110> sculpture<00:05:00.110> to<00:05:00.290> stand<00:05:00.560> up<00:05:00.740> straight

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:00.920 
get the sculpture to stand up straight

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.250 
get the sculpture to stand up straight
and<00:05:01.340> be<00:05:01.460> balanced<00:05:02.060> while<00:05:02.360> I<00:05:02.420> was<00:05:02.780> putting<00:05:03.140> it

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
and be balanced while I was putting it

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.990 
and be balanced while I was putting it
into<00:05:03.710> the<00:05:04.070> grate<00:05:04.220> into<00:05:04.340> the<00:05:04.520> concrete<00:05:04.880> into

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
into the grate into the concrete into

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.730 
into the grate into the concrete into
the<00:05:05.120> ground<00:05:05.420> and<00:05:05.710> I<00:05:06.710> pulled<00:05:07.520> out<00:05:07.760> this

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
the ground and I pulled out this

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.300 
the ground and I pulled out this
sawhorse<00:05:09.740> and<00:05:10.100> I<00:05:10.910> ended<00:05:11.780> up<00:05:11.960> duct<00:05:12.590> taping<00:05:12.950> it

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
sawhorse and I ended up duct taping it

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.190 
sawhorse and I ended up duct taping it
well<00:05:13.790> first<00:05:14.090> I<00:05:14.210> did<00:05:14.360> painters<00:05:14.750> tape<00:05:14.930> but<00:05:15.110> that

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
well first I did painters tape but that

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.160 
well first I did painters tape but that
didn't<00:05:15.470> hold<00:05:15.620> so<00:05:15.830> well<00:05:16.130> I<00:05:16.810> kind<00:05:17.810> of<00:05:17.900> mentioned

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:18.170 
didn't hold so well I kind of mentioned

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.800 
didn't hold so well I kind of mentioned
that<00:05:18.230> I<00:05:18.290> have<00:05:18.470> to<00:05:18.620> redo<00:05:18.890> things<00:05:19.100> often<00:05:19.790> so<00:05:20.600> then

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
that I have to redo things often so then

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.770 
that I have to redo things often so then
I<00:05:20.900> used<00:05:21.170> duct<00:05:21.470> tape<00:05:21.620> and<00:05:22.220> got<00:05:23.030> it<00:05:23.180> to<00:05:23.300> work<00:05:23.450> and

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
I used duct tape and got it to work and

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.330 
I used duct tape and got it to work and
then<00:05:23.930> to<00:05:24.500> keep<00:05:24.710> the<00:05:25.070> rebar<00:05:26.770> parallel<00:05:27.770> with<00:05:28.160> the

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
then to keep the rebar parallel with the

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.250 
then to keep the rebar parallel with the
board's<00:05:28.730> I<00:05:28.880> ended<00:05:29.240> up<00:05:29.360> putting<00:05:29.630> a<00:05:29.960> little

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
board's I ended up putting a little

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.200 
board's I ended up putting a little
spacers<00:05:30.830> between<00:05:30.860> it<00:05:31.430> and<00:05:31.460> taping<00:05:31.730> those<00:05:32.000> in

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
spacers between it and taping those in

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.440 
spacers between it and taping those in
as<00:05:32.360> well<00:05:32.390> and<00:05:33.460> then<00:05:34.460> this<00:05:34.760> is<00:05:34.940> the<00:05:35.120> finished

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:35.450 
as well and then this is the finished

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:38.050 
as well and then this is the finished
sculpture<00:05:36.110> and<00:05:36.410> I'm<00:05:37.070> happy<00:05:37.460> with<00:05:37.580> it<00:05:37.730> I<00:05:37.820> think

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
sculpture and I'm happy with it I think

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.110 
sculpture and I'm happy with it I think
that<00:05:38.210> I<00:05:38.240> am<00:05:38.450> going<00:05:38.660> to<00:05:38.750> go<00:05:38.960> in<00:05:39.290> and<00:05:39.560> put<00:05:39.860> some

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
that I am going to go in and put some

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.640 
that I am going to go in and put some
some<00:05:41.120> more<00:05:41.330> probably<00:05:41.780> of<00:05:41.990> the<00:05:42.110> washers<00:05:42.620> and

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 
some more probably of the washers and

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.100 
some more probably of the washers and
screws<00:05:42.980> in<00:05:43.610> on<00:05:43.850> the<00:05:44.000> bottom<00:05:44.300> part<00:05:44.600> of<00:05:44.690> it<00:05:44.840> and

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
screws in on the bottom part of it and

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.110 
screws in on the bottom part of it and
add<00:05:45.650> a<00:05:45.680> little<00:05:45.860> bit<00:05:46.070> more<00:05:46.310> interest<00:05:46.670> there<00:05:46.940> and

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
add a little bit more interest there and

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.300 
add a little bit more interest there and
stuff<00:05:47.360> but<00:05:47.690> I'm<00:05:48.440> happy<00:05:48.830> with<00:05:48.920> how<00:05:49.070> it<00:05:49.280> turned

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.310 
stuff but I'm happy with how it turned

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.100 
stuff but I'm happy with how it turned
out<00:05:49.700> and<00:05:50.000> of<00:05:50.120> course<00:05:50.150> I<00:05:50.420> still<00:05:50.600> need<00:05:50.780> to<00:05:50.870> put

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
out and of course I still need to put

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:52.600 
out and of course I still need to put
you<00:05:51.350> know<00:05:51.380> grass<00:05:51.710> or<00:05:52.010> rocks<00:05:52.250> or<00:05:52.460> something

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
you know grass or rocks or something

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.100 
you know grass or rocks or something
around<00:05:53.000> the<00:05:53.150> base<00:05:53.330> of<00:05:53.360> it<00:05:53.660> because<00:05:53.810> it's<00:05:53.990> just

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 
around the base of it because it's just

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:55.390 
around the base of it because it's just
kind<00:05:54.290> of<00:05:54.440> sitting<00:05:54.740> there<00:05:54.890> in<00:05:55.040> the<00:05:55.130> middle<00:05:55.160> of

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
kind of sitting there in the middle of

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.450 
kind of sitting there in the middle of
the<00:05:55.610> lawn<00:05:55.820> but<00:05:56.350> other<00:05:57.350> than<00:05:57.620> that<00:05:57.680> I<00:05:57.830> think<00:05:58.160> I'm

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
the lawn but other than that I think I'm

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.850 
the lawn but other than that I think I'm
really<00:05:58.700> happy<00:05:58.880> with<00:05:59.150> it<00:05:59.360> so<00:05:59.600> I<00:06:00.140> hope<00:06:00.620> that<00:06:00.770> you

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860 
really happy with it so I hope that you

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.560 
really happy with it so I hope that you
jump<00:06:01.130> in<00:06:01.340> and<00:06:01.580> try<00:06:01.760> some<00:06:02.000> projects<00:06:02.390> of<00:06:02.540> your

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:02.570 
jump in and try some projects of your

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.990 
jump in and try some projects of your
own<00:06:02.900> and<00:06:03.260> this<00:06:04.010> is<00:06:04.190> that<00:06:04.340> round<00:06:04.610> thing<00:06:04.820> that

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 
own and this is that round thing that

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.750 
own and this is that round thing that
you<00:06:05.090> saw<00:06:05.300> earlier<00:06:05.570> in<00:06:05.870> the<00:06:06.410> tutorial<00:06:06.980> and<00:06:07.160> that

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:07.760 
you saw earlier in the tutorial and that

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.520 
you saw earlier in the tutorial and that
I<00:06:07.790> had<00:06:08.060> scrounged<00:06:08.720> up<00:06:08.870> it<00:06:09.020> was<00:06:09.140> actually<00:06:09.500> a

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:09.530 
I had scrounged up it was actually a

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.160 
I had scrounged up it was actually a
plant<00:06:09.920> base<00:06:10.190> with<00:06:10.490> wheels<00:06:10.790> and<00:06:11.150> really<00:06:12.050> no

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:12.170 
plant base with wheels and really no

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.260 
plant base with wheels and really no
good<00:06:12.350> for<00:06:12.560> anything<00:06:12.710> but<00:06:13.130> I<00:06:13.370> had<00:06:13.820> some<00:06:13.970> extra

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:14.270 
good for anything but I had some extra

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.720 
good for anything but I had some extra
concrete<00:06:14.480> and<00:06:15.050> at<00:06:15.470> the<00:06:15.620> end<00:06:15.770> so<00:06:16.040> I<00:06:16.070> just<00:06:16.400> dumped

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:16.730 
concrete and at the end so I just dumped

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:18.340 
concrete and at the end so I just dumped
it<00:06:16.820> in<00:06:16.970> there<00:06:17.180> and<00:06:17.390> then<00:06:17.540> I<00:06:17.570> started<00:06:18.290> looking

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.350 
it in there and then I started looking

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.830 
it in there and then I started looking
around<00:06:18.830> in<00:06:19.160> my<00:06:19.280> workshop<00:06:19.820> for<00:06:20.480> things<00:06:20.690> that

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:20.840 
around in my workshop for things that

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.460 
around in my workshop for things that
would<00:06:20.990> add<00:06:21.170> some<00:06:21.740> visual<00:06:21.890> interest<00:06:22.430> to<00:06:22.580> it<00:06:22.850> and

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:23.470 
would add some visual interest to it and

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.750 
would add some visual interest to it and
you'll<00:06:24.470> notice<00:06:24.680> that<00:06:24.920> I<00:06:24.980> left<00:06:25.310> a<00:06:25.520> lot<00:06:25.730> of

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:25.760 
you'll notice that I left a lot of

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.850 
you'll notice that I left a lot of
negative<00:06:26.390> space<00:06:26.570> and<00:06:27.050> that's<00:06:27.320> something<00:06:27.650> that

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
negative space and that's something that

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.640 
negative space and that's something that
I<00:06:28.010> do<00:06:28.160> with<00:06:28.820> layouts<00:06:29.060> I<00:06:29.420> think<00:06:29.690> it<00:06:29.840> adds<00:06:30.170> a<00:06:30.470> lot

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:30.650 
I do with layouts I think it adds a lot

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.820 
I do with layouts I think it adds a lot
more<00:06:30.710> interest<00:06:31.310> to<00:06:32.230> leave<00:06:33.230> a<00:06:33.290> place<00:06:33.500> for<00:06:33.740> your

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:33.830 
more interest to leave a place for your

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.550 
more interest to leave a place for your
eye<00:06:33.860> to<00:06:34.010> rest<00:06:34.370> and<00:06:34.610> then<00:06:34.700> it<00:06:35.540> makes<00:06:35.810> the<00:06:36.050> the

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560 
eye to rest and then it makes the the

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.260 
eye to rest and then it makes the the
circles<00:06:36.980> in<00:06:37.100> this<00:06:37.250> case<00:06:37.490> more<00:06:37.820> interesting

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:38.270 
circles in this case more interesting

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.450 
circles in this case more interesting
when<00:06:38.390> you<00:06:38.510> look<00:06:38.660> at<00:06:38.840> them<00:06:39.400> Thanks
