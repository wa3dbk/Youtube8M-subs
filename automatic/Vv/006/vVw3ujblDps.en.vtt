be 6 wide by seven high and you need to

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:02.810 
be 6 wide by seven high and you need to
build<00:01:00.570> three<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.500> those<00:01:01.860> doesn't<00:01:02.699> matter

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
little slug pieces up here then I just

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.950 
little slug pieces up here then I just
put<00:01:22.860> some<00:01:23.220> Brooks<00:01:23.580> underneath<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.360> support<00:01:24.810> it

is 12 studs across by five hi just build
up<00:02:25.840> and<00:02:26.320> then<00:02:27.040> you<00:02:27.250> will<00:02:27.430> want<00:02:27.460> to<00:02:27.760> build<00:02:28.060> one

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
up and then you will want to build one

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.440 
up and then you will want to build one
layer<00:02:28.750> of<00:02:29.110> 14<00:02:29.650> across<00:02:30.130> so<00:02:30.730> we<00:02:31.000> need<00:02:31.180> two<00:02:31.420> of

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
layer of 14 across so we need two of

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.680 
layer of 14 across so we need two of
these<00:02:31.750> Brooks<00:02:32.140> at<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.740> edges<00:02:32.950> of<00:02:33.400> the<00:02:33.520> 14<00:02:34.210> wide

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
these Brooks at the edges of the 14 wide

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.100 
these Brooks at the edges of the 14 wide
layer<00:02:35.380> and<00:02:35.710> then<00:02:35.980> we<00:02:36.250> will<00:02:36.430> build<00:02:36.670> a<00:02:36.940> 15<00:02:37.720> wide

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
layer and then we will build a 15 wide

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.870 
layer and then we will build a 15 wide
layer<00:02:38.530> and<00:02:39.300> then<00:02:40.300> a<00:02:40.540> 16<00:02:41.320> wide<00:02:41.590> layer<00:02:41.920> and<00:02:42.190> then

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
layer and then a 16 wide layer and then

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.410 
layer and then a 16 wide layer and then
you<00:02:43.210> will<00:02:43.360> put<00:02:43.690> a<00:02:43.930> 1<00:02:44.320> by<00:02:44.500> 8<00:02:44.740> flat<00:02:45.070> plate<00:02:45.520> and<00:02:45.790> a<00:02:46.390> 1

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
you will put a 1 by 8 flat plate and a 1

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.150 
you will put a 1 by 8 flat plate and a 1
by<00:02:46.840> 6<00:02:46.870> flat<00:02:47.620> plate<00:02:47.920> and<00:02:48.660> here<00:02:49.660> you<00:02:49.960> will<00:02:50.140> put<00:02:50.410> to

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
by 6 flat plate and here you will put to

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.080 
by 6 flat plate and here you will put to
go<00:02:51.430> one<00:02:51.670> flat<00:02:52.000> layer<00:02:52.240> 1<00:02:52.630> by<00:02:52.810> 1<00:02:53.050> flat<00:02:53.260> plate<00:02:53.680> a<00:02:54.090> 1

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
go one flat layer 1 by 1 flat plate a 1

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.750 
go one flat layer 1 by 1 flat plate a 1
by<00:02:55.300> 8<00:02:55.510> flat<00:02:56.020> light<00:02:56.380> just<00:02:57.220> connect<00:02:57.580> it<00:02:57.700> like

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
by 8 flat light just connect it like

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.700 
by 8 flat light just connect it like
that<00:02:58.180> and<00:02:58.450> 3<00:02:59.410> 1<00:02:59.620> by<00:02:59.800> 4<00:03:00.100> flat<00:03:00.370> plates<00:03:01.110> now<00:03:02.110> I<00:03:02.140> just

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.710 
that and 3 1 by 4 flat plates now I just

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.680 
that and 3 1 by 4 flat plates now I just
did<00:03:03.100> it<00:03:03.130> like<00:03:03.280> this<00:03:03.820> to<00:03:04.240> match<00:03:04.480> the<00:03:04.840> ramp<00:03:06.570> so<00:03:07.570> it

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
did it like this to match the ramp so it

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.370 
did it like this to match the ramp so it
looks<00:03:07.840> just<00:03:07.930> like<00:03:08.260> that<00:03:08.290> and<00:03:09.090> then<00:03:10.090> now<00:03:10.930> you

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
looks just like that and then now you

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.270 
looks just like that and then now you
will<00:03:11.560> get<00:03:11.830> the<00:03:12.100> special<00:03:12.760> one<00:03:13.590> socio<00:03:14.590> it's<00:03:14.950> a

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
will get the special one socio it's a

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.690 
will get the special one socio it's a
two<00:03:16.150> by<00:03:16.450> two<00:03:16.480> high<00:03:17.050> plus<00:03:17.770> another<00:03:18.160> 1<00:03:18.460> by<00:03:18.640> 2

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
two by two high plus another 1 by 2

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.480 
two by two high plus another 1 by 2
brick<00:03:19.120> and<00:03:19.330> then<00:03:20.110> I<00:03:20.320> won't<00:03:20.650> let<00:03:20.800> you<00:03:21.100> rip<00:03:21.310> with

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.490 
brick and then I won't let you rip with

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.210 
brick and then I won't let you rip with
a<00:03:21.520> hole<00:03:21.820> in<00:03:22.120> there<00:03:22.330> put<00:03:23.050> an<00:03:23.200> axle<00:03:23.710> throw<00:03:23.980> it<00:03:24.040> and

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
a hole in there put an axle throw it and

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.960 
a hole in there put an axle throw it and
then<00:03:24.730> put<00:03:25.290> one<00:03:26.290> of<00:03:26.440> these<00:03:26.650> technique<00:03:27.430> works

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
then put one of these technique works

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.860 
then put one of these technique works
that<00:03:28.720> are<00:03:28.750> 14<00:03:29.620> wide<00:03:30.070> make<00:03:31.000> sure<00:03:31.030> it's<00:03:31.360> 14<00:03:31.840> wide

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
that are 14 wide make sure it's 14 wide

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.190 
that are 14 wide make sure it's 14 wide
exactly<00:03:32.740> then<00:03:33.730> you<00:03:34.000> just<00:03:34.240> line<00:03:34.540> it<00:03:34.570> with<00:03:34.870> flat

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
exactly then you just line it with flat

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.790 
exactly then you just line it with flat
plates<00:03:35.530> just<00:03:35.830> like<00:03:36.190> that<00:03:36.400> and<00:03:36.970> then<00:03:37.500> just<00:03:38.500> turn

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
plates just like that and then just turn

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.350 
plates just like that and then just turn
it<00:03:38.980> around<00:03:39.930> stick<00:03:40.930> it<00:03:41.080> on<00:03:41.200> like<00:03:41.470> that<00:03:42.360> and

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
it around stick it on like that and

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.450 
it around stick it on like that and
there<00:03:43.570> we<00:03:43.750> have<00:03:43.780> the<00:03:43.930> back<00:03:44.230> all<00:03:44.440> done<00:03:44.740> now<00:03:45.400> the

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:45.460 
there we have the back all done now the

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.940 
there we have the back all done now the
sidewalls<00:03:46.180> pretty<00:03:46.510> simple<00:03:47.050> you<00:03:47.230> just<00:03:47.440> need<00:03:47.830> to

dimes nickels pennies and quarters and
you<00:04:16.510> will<00:04:16.930> need<00:04:17.109> to<00:04:17.290> modify<00:04:17.650> these<00:04:17.859> plates

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
you will need to modify these plates

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:23.070 
you will need to modify these plates
only<00:04:19.270> to<00:04:19.600> see<00:04:19.780> the<00:04:20.500> size<00:04:20.799> of<00:04:21.130> the<00:04:21.280> coin<00:04:21.750> so<00:04:22.750> here

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
only to see the size of the coin so here

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.490 
only to see the size of the coin so here
that's<00:04:23.710> just<00:04:24.040> a<00:04:24.460> plate<00:04:24.910> so<00:04:25.270> if<00:04:25.990> you're<00:04:26.320> using

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
that's just a plate so if you're using

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.430 
that's just a plate so if you're using
Australian<00:04:27.190> coins<00:04:27.460> it's<00:04:27.790> a<00:04:28.000> 1<00:04:28.300> by<00:04:28.479> 4<00:04:28.510> plate<00:04:29.140> one

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
Australian coins it's a 1 by 4 plate one

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.629 
Australian coins it's a 1 by 4 plate one
way<00:04:29.620> to

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
way to

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:37.230 
way to
1<00:04:30.789> &amp;<00:04:31.659> 2<00:04:32.080> 1<00:04:32.439> by<00:04:32.590> 4<00:04:32.889> is<00:04:33.009> in<00:04:33.129> 1<00:04:33.759> 1<00:04:34.030> by<00:04:34.180> 2<00:04:34.240> and<00:04:35.280> here<00:04:36.280> the

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
1 &amp; 2 1 by 4 is in 1 1 by 2 and here the

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.839 
1 &amp; 2 1 by 4 is in 1 1 by 2 and here the
frame<00:04:37.629> so<00:04:38.259> you<00:04:38.319> will<00:04:38.740> need<00:04:38.889> to<00:04:38.949> build<00:04:39.430> a<00:04:39.550> frame

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:39.849 
frame so you will need to build a frame

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:44.519 
frame so you will need to build a frame
16<00:04:40.629> 5<00:04:41.169> 6<00:04:41.590> and<00:04:41.889> 2<00:04:42.520> 1<00:04:42.849> by<00:04:43.060> 4<00:04:43.360> bricks<00:04:43.689> in<00:04:44.050> the<00:04:44.110> middle

00:04:44.519 --> 00:04:44.529 
16 5 6 and 2 1 by 4 bricks in the middle

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:48.749 
16 5 6 and 2 1 by 4 bricks in the middle
they<00:04:44.830> are<00:04:45.099> four<00:04:45.520> apart<00:04:46.090> each<00:04:46.360> one<00:04:46.689> and<00:04:47.560> so<00:04:48.340> here

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:48.759 
they are four apart each one and so here

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:51.540 
they are four apart each one and so here
i<00:04:48.999> have<00:04:49.389> used<00:04:49.810> some<00:04:50.110> plates<00:04:50.499> just<00:04:50.919> to<00:04:51.099> cover<00:04:51.340> it
