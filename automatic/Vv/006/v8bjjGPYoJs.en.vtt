00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
 How to check and replace the fuse 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:10.800
 thermal if the thermal fuse is 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:13.200
 blown the engine can not start this 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.270
 is the way to check the fuse 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:20.510
 thermal without having to use a multimeter 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:24.580
 unplug the dryer from the outlet 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:27.580
 open the top panel 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:31.640
 the thermal fuse is in the 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:34.620
 Right side of the heater box 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.910
 disconnect the two white wires from the 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.910
 thermal fuse 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.970
 Tighten the terminals on the wires 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.970
 with a plier 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.269
 hooks to the two terminals of the 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.320
 wires to each other so be sure to 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:01:01.559
 who are making a good connection 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:04.170
 Cover the connection with electrical tape and 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.710
 Put them out of the way of any 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.340
 piece with movement close the panel 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.340
 higher 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:21.140
 plug the dryer to the power outlet 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.540
 set the timer in the cycle 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.740
 regular and push on the dial of the 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:30.200
 timer to turn on the dryer 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.659
 without the dryer works well with 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.899
 two wires of thermal fuse 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.990
 hooked to each other this indicates that 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:42.100
 the thermal fuse is blown and what 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:45.620
 you have to replace 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.500
 warning is very dangerous to use the 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.380
 dryer to dry clothes with the 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.640
 thermal fuse wires hooked 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.290
 one another 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:59.570
 simply replace the thermal fuse 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:02.869
 this is the way how to replace the 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.450
 thermal fuse make sure that the 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:10.780
 dryer is disconnected from 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.780
 outlet open the top panel 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.890
 remove this retaining screw 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:23.770
 this is the way to remove the 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.770
 thermal fuse holder 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.510
 remove the support and the thermal fuse 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:46.190
 the replacement kit comes with a 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:50.420
 safety thermostat a fuse 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:53.110
 thermal for a gas dryer and a 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:56.780
 thermal fuse for a dryer 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:03:01.070
 electric the one that has the color point 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:03.470
 pink is for the electric dryer put 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.420
 the thermal fuse in the support 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:09.500
 metal 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:12.680
 I doubled the two ends so that 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.620
 keep the instructions in place 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:19.790
 they do not tell you to do that this is my 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:23.770
 own technique this is the way 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.770
 connects to the heater box 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:32.480
 and how to secure it with the screw 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.480
 Fixing 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.680
 connect the two wires to the fuse 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.280
 thermal 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:47.800
 grasp it with a sharp pointed clamp 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.800
 and hook it in the heater box 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:03.200
 secure it with the screw of its management 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:07.129
 make sure the screw is 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:10.810
 screw in this way disconnect the 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:14.580
 wires to the safety thermostat 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:18.350
 remove the two screws 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:21.770
 remove the thermostat 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:27.030
 put the new one in its place 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:29.960
 screw the two screws connect the 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.960
 two wires 

00:04:30.489 --> 00:04:36.139
 Make sure the thermostat 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:39.649
 security has not been pushed very 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:42.639
 near the heating element adjust what 

00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:42.639
 in this way 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:49.330
 close the top panel 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:00.210
 it is necessary to check the air flow 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:03.600
 to the outside before using the 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:07.259
 dryer with this the dryer in the 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:11.030
 outlet stick a piece of paper 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:11.030
 in the air duct 

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:16.050
 put the temperature control on 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:19.830
 Cold air 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.800
 put the dryer in the regular cycle and 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:25.280
 wear the 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:28.280
 if the air comes out strongly so you can 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:32.800
 start using the dryer 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.800
 if the air comes out without force 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:39.040
 It is necessary to check the hose 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:42.850
 gas leak to see if there is any 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:45.220
 obstruction and be sure that the 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:48.820
 filter that picks up the lint is not 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:51.700
 full of fluff remember that the flow of 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:55.389
 air to the outside has to be 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:58.600
 Strong or heater element box 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:06:02.200
 it will overheat will diffuse the fuse 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:05.590
 new thermal very soon to see more
