00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
am not sure but that seems pretty rare

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
because I think efficiency for is pretty

because I think efficiency for is pretty
good<00:02:14.560> if<00:02:14.830> so<00:02:15.040> that<00:02:15.220> might<00:02:15.430> need<00:02:15.610> to<00:02:15.670> be<00:02:15.790> nerfed

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
good if so that might need to be nerfed
