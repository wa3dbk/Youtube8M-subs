00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.150
 tutorial in which I show how I like me 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.069
 the fine the shaders and wanted in the 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.030
 minecraft 1.6 from my pc together 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.410
 have installed 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.240
 First and foremost we need that 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.440
 reports installer and the fight us 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.150
 however, are in the download 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.400
 description and after us then through 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.439
 have fought advertising and then all 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.000
 millionaires have become tricks through stock exchanges 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.070
 we have the forge installer here 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.990
 then the company with java normal 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.630
 and click ok for us 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.590
 Ford spokesman subsequently posts 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.500
 let's start minecraft with the whole 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.660
 normal launcher and then choose here 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.730
 the prelude and start minecraft 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.899
 once very briefly and then it went 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.440
 shoot directly again we need that 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.899
 not at first 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.829
 and now we have the shader first 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.149
 model down 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.040
 the download is of course also in the 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.710
 description I have this here now 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.450
 this year as a recommendation for you 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.100
 if you but I should bank around 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.210
 is there an alternative other yes that 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.170
 can you also in the 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.489
 Download description 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.410
 I'm doing it now with this one 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.030
 yes, this year we move in 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.859
 the minecraft mods folder rows of us 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.960
 Now by the progressing dollar 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.460
 was created and then we have 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.570
 actually everything done so far 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.379
 we still need to pack shader 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.240
 download 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.320
 we also find that 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.720
 downloadlink again in the 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.310
 description and these shader packs do 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.810
 would be a folder that we in minecraft 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.189
 magazine shape ex call 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.330
 I have a few more things now 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.850
 here the downloadlink I now 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.470
 have shown there are quite so many 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.549
 where I have the others he has got me 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.780
 Marios sent there I can now 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.729
 unfortunately not a download anymore 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.890
 You would have to offer to see if he did 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.450
 doing something separately and then 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.400
 we can minecraft quite normally with that 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.439
 start research pro and then should 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.850
 the shader will work if we are 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.710
 as if still deeply in and wÃ¶rth 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.659
 we need the 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.520
 magic launcher the shop and finish down 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.659
 because we do it separately with two 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.880
 starters 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.869
 because whether the fine with the shader not 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.850
 that means we can either 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.369
 approach the shaders or the fine ones 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.500
 together with word depending on what you want 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.899
 he just wants to lust he has like 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.090
 long us so the magic lounge first 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.979
 down here everything in the description 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.600
 and then you can join me now 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.939
 in front of windows and then i have myself here 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.689
 downloaded the magic lounge as 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.430
 in addition took under again the 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:07.140
 zip file for the singleplayer comments 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.330
 so wait and see for opticians 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.310
 once here on download click here 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.630
 for singleplayer commands and 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.340
 time to find I've already 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.200
 and should have chosen also with light and 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.090
 Ultra just work on download 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.220
 click and then we have to 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.450
 something like advertising and millionaire 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.739
 scrum these two zip files then as 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.080
 next step we open the 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:31.110
 singleplayer commands file and have 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.910
 then here is a word file this is 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.200
 point yes file we add in one 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.370
 this folder in here 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.930
 if that is not there 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.410
 I just have to create the folder 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.910
 and paste the word there and then 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.540
 Let's start the magic next 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.049
 Run lounge on the main shortly 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.970
 and then have a few more 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.480
 to meet attitudes there and indeed 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.769
 Let's go to setup and then we'll go 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.450
 we have to select the bots first 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.450
 I have always prepared as 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.269
 First of all we have to at environment 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.040
 select the fomc profile and then 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.540
 we can just add it now 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.980
 here and then we choose ours 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.950
 memory location and take for example 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.560
 it had to be deep or hold 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.140
 The singleplayer coming is coming 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.760
 tip file and we can activate if 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.250
 we probably do not have them and then 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.530
 we'll add that to it 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.329
 and we have to go here at the 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.769
 parameters still this code here 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:25.019
 There are also those in the insert 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.670
 video description and after that we can 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.750
 just start minecraft quite normally 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.120
 click ok 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.260
 to what extent have everything selected and 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.739
 then you could log in 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.540
 and then we would instead of the shader ob 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.100
 deep in and wanted to have in there that is 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.260
 always like how you taste 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.350
 has a problem but there is yes 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.940
 the shader with opti must have fine white 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.049
 one before one would do this here now 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.459
 before I start here now if we 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.630
 would have to start now 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.889
 actually smear minecraft 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.109
 if I did everything right now 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:54.269
 I would have to completely lubricate yes 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:55.680
 or simply they do not start now 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.569
 once started briefly and again 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.810
 greased because we still have in 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:02.280
 our motto folder the shader year 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.019
 file that's why I have a mod synonymous 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.000
 link created because if I do not 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.100
 play with the shake or deep into it 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.180
 and would like to take this I have 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.120
 take these out 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.670
 and if I can do magic well now 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.139
 would have to as if I would have to go away 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.549
 everything works now 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.229
 by the shader being thrown out 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.349
 I just pulled it out 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.280
 but threw on the desktop 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:24.639
 There minecraft must be quite normal now 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.080
 start and 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.669
 do not play which by what 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.189
 wonder and then we can stop that 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:31.810
 enjoy the benefits of word and optics 

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:33.009
 yes if you have any questions then you can 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.300
 you write them in the comments 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:35.499
 otherwise it was time I thank you 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.680
 for watching until next time 

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:37.680
 bye
