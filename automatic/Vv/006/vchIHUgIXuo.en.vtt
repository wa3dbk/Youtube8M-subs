00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:27.279 
chord with the fifth string and we're

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:29.009 
chord with the fifth string and we're
going<00:00:27.429> to<00:00:27.460> hammer<00:00:27.670> quickly<00:00:28.330> into<00:00:28.660> the<00:00:28.779> fifth

and then six three down
and<00:00:41.370> repeat<00:00:43.670> don't<00:00:44.670> worry<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.120> tab<00:00:45.360> sort

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
and repeat don't worry that the tab sort

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.450 
and repeat don't worry that the tab sort
of<00:00:45.750> suggests<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.650> first<00:00:46.920> strand<00:00:47.280> is

of suggests that the first strand is

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.370 
of suggests that the first strand is
going<00:00:47.760> up<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.630> the<00:00:48.720> first<00:00:48.960> string<00:00:49.170> in<00:00:49.290> the

second or coming from the second that's

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.770 
second or coming from the second that's
sort<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.220> the<00:00:53.340> way<00:00:53.460> Willie<00:00:53.730> Nelson<00:00:54.270> plays<00:00:54.570> it

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
sort of the way Willie Nelson plays it

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.510 
sort of the way Willie Nelson plays it
in<00:00:54.900> his<00:00:55.020> style<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.590> strumming<00:00:55.890> but<00:00:56.370> it's

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
in his style of strumming but it's

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.040 
in his style of strumming but it's
really<00:00:56.820> not<00:00:57.090> significant<00:00:57.840> it's<00:00:57.930> not

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
really not significant it's not

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.800 
really not significant it's not
important<00:00:58.620> in<00:00:58.770> this<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.370> it's<00:00:59.520> based<00:00:59.850> down<00:01:00.450> on

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:00.810 
important in this so it's based down on

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:07.640 
important in this so it's based down on
bass<00:01:01.110> down<00:01:04.250> one<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.520> A<00:01:06.060> two<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.600> ER<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.260> the

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
bass down one and A two and ER and the

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.160 
bass down one and A two and ER and the
song<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:07.979> in<00:01:08.100> two<00:01:08.280> beats<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.670> bar<00:01:09.140> then<00:01:10.140> we

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
song is in two beats to the bar then we

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.719 
song is in two beats to the bar then we
start<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.680> sing<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.280> we're<00:01:11.520> going<00:01:11.670> to

start to sing and we're going to

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.910 
start to sing and we're going to
continue<00:01:11.910> with<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.479> same<00:01:12.660> pattern<00:01:13.170> but<00:01:13.410> we

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
continue with the same pattern but we

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:21.290 
continue with the same pattern but we
won't<00:01:14.250> have<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.729> bass<00:01:14.880> on<00:01:15.119> any<00:01:15.240> more<00:01:20.090> on<00:01:21.090> the

we'll go back to e and now you alternate
the<00:01:41.310> babe<00:01:41.640> turns<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.270> bass<00:01:42.420> on<00:01:42.600> its<00:01:42.750> head<00:01:42.900> and

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
goes six down five down actually

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.920 
goes six down five down actually
throughout<00:01:47.730> the<00:01:47.940> verse<00:01:48.120> if<00:01:48.300> you<00:01:48.420> prefer<00:01:48.780> you

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
throughout the verse if you prefer you

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.500 
throughout the verse if you prefer you
could<00:01:49.050> go<00:01:49.230> six<00:01:49.560> down<00:01:49.980> on<00:01:50.280> five<00:01:50.580> down<00:01:51.090> up<00:01:51.300> which

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
could go six down on five down up which

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.030 
could go six down on five down up which
is<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.660> more<00:01:51.870> conventional<00:01:52.200> way<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.770> strumming

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
is a more conventional way of strumming

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.170 
is a more conventional way of strumming
e<00:01:54.020> so<00:01:55.020> that's<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.890> first<00:01:56.130> three<00:01:56.550> bars<00:01:56.760> and

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
e so that's the first three bars and

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.210 
e so that's the first three bars and
then<00:01:57.720> on<00:01:57.810> bar<00:01:57.990> six<00:01:58.380> we're<00:01:58.590> going<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.800> go<00:01:58.920> bass

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
then on bar six we're going to go bass

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.580 
then on bar six we're going to go bass
down<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.480> we're<00:02:00.630> going<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.840> climb<00:02:01.140> up<00:02:01.410> the

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
down and we're going to climb up the

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.400 
down and we're going to climb up the
fifth<00:02:01.800> string<00:02:02.070> open<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:03.000> first<00:02:03.270> fret<00:02:03.660> as<00:02:03.930> we

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
fifth string open to first fret as we

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.320 
fifth string open to first fret as we
head<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:04.920> second<00:02:05.550> fret<00:02:05.730> fifth<00:02:06.060> string<00:02:06.120> and

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
head to the second fret fifth string and
