00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.280 
issued out and basically I think this
could<00:01:14.460> be<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.580> really<00:01:14.880> good<00:01:15.119> idea<00:01:15.210> if<00:01:15.689> EA<00:01:15.990> done

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
could be a really good idea if EA done

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.660 
could be a really good idea if EA done
it<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.619> as<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:16.979> can<00:01:17.070> see<00:01:17.100> right<00:01:17.220> now<00:01:17.430> then

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
it and as you can see right now then

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.160 
it and as you can see right now then
here<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:17.939> my<00:01:17.970> interpretation<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:18.930> what<00:01:19.140> a

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
here is my interpretation of what a

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.780 
here is my interpretation of what a
limited<00:01:19.650> card<00:01:19.890> could<00:01:20.040> look<00:01:20.280> like<00:01:20.310> asked<00:01:20.640> to

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
limited card could look like asked to

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.999 
limited card could look like asked to
see<00:01:20.939> else<00:01:21.450> Rory<00:01:21.930> this<00:01:22.080> would<00:01:22.200> be<00:01:22.290> his<00:01:22.350> fifa<00:01:22.770> 12

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
see else Rory this would be his fifa 12

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.710 
see else Rory this would be his fifa 12

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
card back on 5000 like to mention and it

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.460 
card back on 5000 like to mention and it
was<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.880> silver<00:01:27.180> as<00:01:27.360> well<00:01:27.390> but<00:01:27.600> basically<00:01:27.990> what

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
was a silver as well but basically what

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.260 
was a silver as well but basically what
i<00:01:28.530> think<00:01:28.920> they<00:01:29.009> could<00:01:29.250> do<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:29.520> potentially<00:01:30.150> at

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
i think they could do is potentially at

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.819 
i think they could do is potentially at
they<00:01:30.420> give<00:01:30.570> X<00:01:30.869> amount<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.170> cards<00:01:31.500> say<00:01:31.619> yeah

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
they give X amount of cards say yeah

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.640 
they give X amount of cards say yeah

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
1,500 some of that obviously based off

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.859 
1,500 some of that obviously based off
the<00:01:34.770> size<00:01:34.979> of<00:01:35.130> community<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.820> they<00:01:36.659> bring

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
something a little bit different me

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.319 
something a little bit different me
throughout<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.100> year<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.490> we<00:01:41.820> get<00:01:41.970> legends

and we also get Tina weeks but this one

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.679 
and we also get Tina weeks but this one

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
this could be a new in center to open

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.359 
this could be a new in center to open
packs<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.470> here's<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.860> first<00:01:47.009> thing<00:01:47.250> that

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
packs and here's the first thing that

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.010 
packs and here's the first thing that
I've<00:01:47.460> taken<00:01:47.579> from<00:01:47.939> that<00:01:48.060> tops<00:01:48.299> kik<00:01:48.540> app<00:01:48.750> as<00:01:48.930> you

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
I've taken from that tops kik app as you

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.230 
I've taken from that tops kik app as you
can<00:01:49.140> see<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.350> says<00:01:49.470> limited<00:01:49.939> 1500<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.090> said

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
can see it says limited 1500 and it said

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.639 
can see it says limited 1500 and it said
that<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.479> bomb<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.840> bomb<00:01:51.869> left<00:01:52.439> of<00:01:52.590> the

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
that the bomb the bomb left of the

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.620 
that the bomb the bomb left of the
previous<00:01:53.009> card<00:01:53.189> on<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.460> app<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:54.540> would

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
previous card on the app and that would

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.149 
previous card on the app and that would
mean<00:01:54.750> how<00:01:54.960> many<00:01:55.020> cards<00:01:55.409> are<00:01:55.560> actually<00:01:55.829> issued

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
mean how many cards are actually issued

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.010 
mean how many cards are actually issued
out<00:01:56.280> onto<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:56.759> fifa<00:01:57.149> ultimate<00:01:57.270> team<00:01:57.509> game

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
out onto that fifa ultimate team game

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.170 
out onto that fifa ultimate team game
mode<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:58.530> obviously<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.549> thief<00:01:59.700> community<00:02:00.119> is

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
mode so obviously the thief community is

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.359 
mode so obviously the thief community is
absolutely<00:02:00.570> huge<00:02:00.780> should<00:02:00.990> be<00:02:01.170> more<00:02:01.320> than<00:02:01.380> 1500

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
absolutely huge should be more than 1500

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.039 
absolutely huge should be more than 1500
cards<00:02:02.579> available<00:02:02.670> but<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.479> next<00:02:03.750> show<00:02:03.869> will

the<00:04:07.090> coins<00:04:07.299> of<00:04:07.450> stuff<00:04:07.660> guys<00:04:07.840> so<00:04:08.079> I<00:04:08.109> reinjure<00:04:08.620> it

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
the coins of stuff guys so I reinjure it

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:10.080 
the coins of stuff guys so I reinjure it
and<00:04:08.950> that's<00:04:09.400> perhaps<00:04:09.549> where<00:04:09.790> I<00:04:09.819> got<00:04:09.940> the<00:04:10.030> idea

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
and that's perhaps where I got the idea

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.490 
and that's perhaps where I got the idea
from<00:04:10.450> hence<00:04:10.690> why<00:04:10.840> I've<00:04:10.930> tied<00:04:11.109> it<00:04:11.260> into<00:04:11.380> the

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
from hence why I've tied it into the

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.170 
from hence why I've tied it into the
video<00:04:11.709> and<00:04:11.889> may<00:04:12.040> do<00:04:12.280> some<00:04:12.489> squat<00:04:12.700> builders<00:04:13.030> and
