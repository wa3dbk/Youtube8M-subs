00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.390
 Good morning to all of us and sledgehammer. 

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.609
 but I love talking about something very interesting that has been growing every day. 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:08.470
 day 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:09.740
 which is as follows 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.740
 the classic ballet for adults 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:17.520
 and we take preference with the physiotherapist who spends all day 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:19.050
 Working 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.089
 I can assure you 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:27.069
 there is no inconvenience that an adult person of 40 50 60 years 

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:30.259
 to practice ballet 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:35.579
 why first that's healthy second by people like those 40 years 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.230
 work without knowing that she does not have time to come to the professional 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.110
 but she has time to use this activity a pleasant moment 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.660
 that will bring many benefits 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.600
 posture is the main 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.140
 flexibility 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.729
 strength musicality I have to be more and more adults 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:56.890
 being interested 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.530
 and mostly look-behind stationery papers that do not 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.530
 was done before and today it can be 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.530
 As a specialist, I reinforce 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:09.920
 any 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.430
 one can come to dance practice that I have in which patients until 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.130
 people with deformity 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.090
 an astrophysics of physical sciences and that as it is 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.090
 I encourage this because what is to come 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.299
 to have patience 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.299
 it is spoken on a battlefield 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.700
 if today you get a modern Novak tip shoe that puts on the foot maybe 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.980
 he surprised 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.220
 will see that it is no longer that bogeyman of the past 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.159
 is much more comfortable and will even allow him with presence sneaker 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.330
 and go to the classroom knowing there are classes for adults 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.480
 It can rain 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.530
 so if this is your case 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.110
 I took courage 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.300
 pass dancing 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.350
 Your love thanks a good weekend everyone and until our next program.
