many people have found whilst playing
with<00:00:02.520> the<00:00:02.580> oculus<00:00:02.760> rift<00:00:02.909> if<00:00:03.389> there's<00:00:03.780> a<00:00:03.840> little

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
with the oculus rift if there's a little

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.900 
with the oculus rift if there's a little
bit<00:00:04.080> of<00:00:04.200> a<00:00:04.259> breeze<00:00:04.529> on<00:00:04.740> your<00:00:04.859> face<00:00:05.069> from<00:00:05.640> say<00:00:05.819> an

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.950 
open window or a little desk fan it
really<00:00:08.250> helps<00:00:08.550> draw<00:00:08.970> you<00:00:09.030> into<00:00:09.389> virtual

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
really helps draw you into virtual

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.860 
really helps draw you into virtual
reality<00:00:09.990> while<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.160> dk2<00:00:11.639> comes<00:00:12.420> with<00:00:12.660> a

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
reality while the dk2 comes with a

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.890 
reality while the dk2 comes with a
powered<00:00:13.320> USB<00:00:13.349> port<00:00:13.980> on<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.190> front<00:00:14.219> and<00:00:14.900> artic

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
powered USB port on the front and artic

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.670 
powered USB port on the front and artic
make<00:00:16.170> this<00:00:16.320> awesome<00:00:16.820> little<00:00:17.820> USB<00:00:18.510> powered<00:00:19.199> fan

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
make this awesome little USB powered fan

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.980 
make this awesome little USB powered fan
so<00:00:20.189> I'm<00:00:20.250> going<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.460> stick<00:00:20.699> this<00:00:20.850> fan<00:00:21.119> on<00:00:21.420> front

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
so I'm going to stick this fan on front

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.259 
so I'm going to stick this fan on front
of<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.230> dk2<00:00:22.590> probably<00:00:23.550> look<00:00:23.670> like<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.850> complete

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
of the dk2 probably look like a complete

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.420 
of the dk2 probably look like a complete
plonker<00:00:24.810> but<00:00:25.289> who<00:00:25.380> knows<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:25.800> might<00:00:25.920> add<00:00:26.189> to

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
plonker but who knows it might add to

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.640 
plonker but who knows it might add to
the<00:00:26.550> immersive<00:00:27.000> qualities<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.930> worst<00:00:28.380> case

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
the immersive qualities and worst case

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.800 
the immersive qualities and worst case
we'll<00:00:29.250> get<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.429> nice<00:00:29.640> little<00:00:29.910> cooling<00:00:30.539> breeze

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
we'll get a nice little cooling breeze

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.840 
we'll get a nice little cooling breeze
on<00:00:30.990> our<00:00:31.109> face<00:00:31.289> whilst<00:00:31.830> we're<00:00:32.040> deep<00:00:32.309> in<00:00:32.489> virtual

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
on our face whilst we're deep in virtual

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.020 
on our face whilst we're deep in virtual
reality<00:00:36.920> ok<00:00:37.920> well<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.129> finished<00:00:38.280> send<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:38.910> up

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
reality ok well I finished send it up

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.610 
reality ok well I finished send it up
and<00:00:39.210> get<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.450> on<00:00:39.540> there<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.050> basically<00:00:40.530> I

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
and get it on there and basically I

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.229 
and get it on there and basically I
found<00:00:40.800> out<00:00:41.010> that<00:00:41.160> really<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.670> doesn't<00:00:41.969> work

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
found out that really it doesn't work

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.540 
found out that really it doesn't work
very<00:00:42.270> well<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.809> flops<00:00:43.050> around<00:00:43.410> too<00:00:43.649> much<00:00:43.890> you

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
very well it flops around too much you

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.520 
very well it flops around too much you
can<00:00:45.059> angle<00:00:45.420> this<00:00:45.539> but<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.809> doesn't<00:00:46.050> angle<00:00:46.379> it

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
can angle this but it doesn't angle it

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.680 
can angle this but it doesn't angle it
doesn't<00:00:46.680> blow<00:00:46.980> on<00:00:47.250> your<00:00:47.460> head<00:00:47.700> properly<00:00:47.969> it

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
doesn't blow on your head properly it

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.790 
doesn't blow on your head properly it
blows<00:00:48.899> on<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.140> top<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.379> your<00:00:49.410> head<00:00:49.559> not<00:00:49.710> the

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
blows on the top of your head not the

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.990 
blows on the top of your head not the
bottom<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.129> guess<00:00:50.309> if<00:00:50.430> you've<00:00:50.550> got<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.700> bigger

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
bottom I guess if you've got a bigger

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.510 
bottom I guess if you've got a bigger
one<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.539> putting<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.260> down<00:00:52.320> or<00:00:53.010> had<00:00:53.160> some<00:00:53.340> kind

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
one and putting it down or had some kind

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.160 
one and putting it down or had some kind
of<00:00:53.579> bear<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:54.120> mean<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:54.510> could<00:00:54.660> probably<00:00:54.780> mod

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
of bear I mean you could probably mod

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.810 
of bear I mean you could probably mod
something<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.739> have<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.010> better<00:00:56.399> supporting

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
something and have it better supporting

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.010 
something and have it better supporting
and<00:00:56.910> blow<00:00:57.059> from<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.360> underneath<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.930> that'd

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
and blow from the underneath and that'd

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.709 
and blow from the underneath and that'd
be<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.199> lot<00:00:58.320> better<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:59.420> what<00:01:00.420> I've<00:01:00.570> done

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
be a lot better and what I've done

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.150 
be a lot better and what I've done
though<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.020> I've<00:01:01.140> stuck<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.559> on<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.980> my

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
though is I've stuck it on to my

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.799 
though is I've stuck it on to my
keyboard<00:01:03.090> I'll<00:01:03.210> just<00:01:03.329> stick<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.629> back<00:01:03.660> on

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
keyboard I'll just stick it back on

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.170 
keyboard I'll just stick it back on
there<00:01:04.140> now<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:06.590> if<00:01:07.590> you've<00:01:07.799> got<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.180> USB

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
there now and if you've got a USB

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.670 
there now and if you've got a USB
keyboard<00:01:09.450> or<00:01:09.659> if<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:09.840> get<00:01:09.990> one<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.229> these<00:01:10.320> fans

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
keyboard or if you get one of these fans

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.149 
keyboard or if you get one of these fans
that<00:01:10.890> has<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.040> table<00:01:11.520> mount<00:01:11.729> on<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.830> and<00:01:13.830> just<00:01:14.040> go

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
that has a table mount on it and just go

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.560 
that has a table mount on it and just go
for<00:01:14.310> one<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.549> them<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.700> have<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.090> blowing<00:01:15.390> on

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
for one of them and have that blowing on

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.240 
for one of them and have that blowing on
you<00:01:15.780> that's<00:01:16.259> actually<00:01:16.530> giving<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.830> good<00:01:17.009> enough

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
you that's actually giving a good enough

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.280 
you that's actually giving a good enough
amount<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.880> breeze<00:01:18.450> really<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.930> achieve<00:01:19.170> the

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
amount of breeze really to achieve the

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.719 
amount of breeze really to achieve the
same<00:01:19.470> effect<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:19.860> I'm<00:01:19.920> just<00:01:20.040> going<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.250> see<00:01:20.430> if

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
same effect so I'm just going to see if

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.760 
same effect so I'm just going to see if
it<00:01:21.000> adds<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:22.049> immersion<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.470> picked<00:01:22.710> the

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
it adds to the immersion I picked the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.039 
it adds to the immersion I picked the
perfect<00:01:22.799> demo<00:01:23.340> for<00:01:23.610> this<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:24.030> kontiki<00:01:24.600> demo

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
perfect demo for this the kontiki demo

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.899 
perfect demo for this the kontiki demo
it's<00:01:25.229> also<00:01:25.590> in<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.250> itself<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.670> really

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
it's also in and of itself a really

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.090 
it's also in and of itself a really
fantastic<00:01:27.090> scene<00:01:27.810> which<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:28.590> really<00:01:28.920> nicely

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
fantastic scene which is really nicely

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.249 
fantastic scene which is really nicely
put<00:01:29.400> together<00:01:29.490> with<00:01:29.850> really<00:01:30.180> low<00:01:30.329> latency<00:01:31.020> and

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
put together with really low latency and

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.090 
put together with really low latency and
they've<00:01:32.159> gone<00:01:32.310> for<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.490> sort<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.990> cartoony

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
they've gone for that sort of cartoony

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.580 
they've gone for that sort of cartoony
finish<00:01:35.100> on<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.700> textures<00:01:36.210> which<00:01:36.990> in<00:01:37.350> my

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
finish on the textures which in my

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.969 
finish on the textures which in my
opinion<00:01:37.680> just<00:01:38.990> just<00:01:39.990> comes<00:01:40.140> out<00:01:40.259> really<00:01:40.710> well

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
opinion just just comes out really well

start ok this arctic breeze fan is not
the<00:01:55.380> most<00:01:55.590> powerful<00:01:56.100> but<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.360> little

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
the most powerful but it is a little

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.340 
the most powerful but it is a little
breeze<00:01:57.899> actually<00:01:58.259> it's<00:01:58.409> really<00:01:58.619> small<00:01:59.009> I<00:02:00.350> can

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
breeze actually it's really small I can

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.459 
breeze actually it's really small I can
say<00:02:01.469> that<00:02:01.619> actually<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.950> does<00:02:03.200> really<00:02:04.200> adds

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
say that actually that does really adds

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.300 
say that actually that does really adds
to<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.799> feeling<00:02:05.040> of<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:07.530> breeze<00:02:07.829> coming<00:02:08.190> from

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
to the feeling of the breeze coming from

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.940 
to the feeling of the breeze coming from
the<00:02:08.580> environment<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.360> not<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:10.560> fact<00:02:10.770> that<00:02:10.800> is

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
the environment and not the fact that is

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.520 
the environment and not the fact that is
coming<00:02:11.099> from<00:02:11.190> my<00:02:11.370> keyboard

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.990 

especially<00:02:17.070> for<00:02:17.190> this<00:02:17.250> demo<00:02:17.610> way<00:02:17.760> it's<00:02:17.910> a

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
especially for this demo way it's a

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.080 
especially for this demo way it's a
really<00:02:18.240> calm<00:02:18.830> really<00:02:19.830> comes<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.400> tiny<00:02:20.880> little

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
really calm really comes to tiny little

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.520 
really calm really comes to tiny little
bit<00:02:21.240> precip<00:02:21.630> fly<00:02:21.840> got<00:02:21.990> there<00:02:22.140> just<00:02:22.320> slightly

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
bit precip fly got there just slightly

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.950 
bit precip fly got there just slightly
moving<00:02:23.040> this<00:02:23.280> this<00:02:23.670> is<00:02:23.760> actually

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
moving this this is actually

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.190 
moving this this is actually
surprisingly<00:02:24.960> effective<00:02:26.930> it<00:02:27.930> wouldn't

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
surprisingly effective it wouldn't

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.300 
surprisingly effective it wouldn't
probably<00:02:28.320> I<00:02:28.470> don't<00:02:28.560> think<00:02:28.830> if<00:02:28.920> you<00:02:29.010> you<00:02:29.220> know

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
probably I don't think if you you know

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.340 
probably I don't think if you you know
if<00:02:29.370> you<00:02:29.520> were<00:02:29.670> in<00:02:29.910> an<00:02:30.060> open-top<00:02:30.540> race<00:02:30.780> car<00:02:31.140> and

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
if you were in an open-top race car and

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.910 
if you were in an open-top race car and
say<00:02:31.500> LFS<00:02:32.400> or<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.880> job<00:02:33.090> you<00:02:33.210> simulate<00:02:33.540> with<00:02:33.660> or<00:02:34.440> if

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
say LFS or a job you simulate with or if

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.470 
say LFS or a job you simulate with or if
support<00:02:35.310> I<00:02:35.400> don't<00:02:36.090> think<00:02:36.240> you'd<00:02:36.330> have<00:02:36.360> the

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
support I don't think you'd have the

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.350 
support I don't think you'd have the
same<00:02:36.810> I<00:02:37.430> mean<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.490> thing<00:02:38.850> is<00:02:39.000> this<00:02:39.090> fan

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
same I mean the thing is this fan

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.210 
same I mean the thing is this fan
actually<00:02:39.570> would<00:02:40.260> it<00:02:40.380> be<00:02:40.470> such<00:02:40.680> a<00:02:40.800> gentle

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
actually would it be such a gentle

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.490 
actually would it be such a gentle
breeze<00:02:41.820> all<00:02:42.720> it's<00:02:43.080> doing<00:02:43.290> is<00:02:45.200> making<00:02:46.200> me<00:02:46.470> feel

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
breeze all it's doing is making me feel

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.500 
breeze all it's doing is making me feel
as<00:02:46.800> if<00:02:46.920> they're<00:02:47.070> on<00:02:47.220> there's<00:02:47.730> just<00:02:47.790> air<00:02:48.120> there

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
basically some people wanted to prove

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.350 
basically some people wanted to prove
that<00:03:59.370> you<00:04:00.020> could<00:04:01.020> build<00:04:01.140> a<00:04:01.260> raft<00:04:01.470> out<00:04:01.770> of<00:04:02.360> trees

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
that you could build a raft out of trees

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.500 
that you could build a raft out of trees
and<00:04:03.690> just<00:04:04.080> using<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:04.709> sea<00:04:04.920> currents<00:04:05.550> throw

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
and just using the sea currents throw

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.860 
and just using the sea currents throw
across<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:07.350> the<00:04:07.680> ocean<00:04:08.010> basically<00:04:08.570> to<00:04:09.570> prove

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
across the the ocean basically to prove

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.230
