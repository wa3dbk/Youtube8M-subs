00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
anything so I give this a 5 because even

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.200

though it's a watery consistency it

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.310 
though it's a watery consistency it
actually<00:04:38.660> really<00:04:38.900> does<00:04:39.729> moisturize<00:04:40.729> my<00:04:41.240> hair

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
actually really does moisturize my hair

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.800 
actually really does moisturize my hair
and<00:04:42.320> maybe<00:04:42.919> he'll<00:04:43.130> feel<00:04:43.310> strong<00:04:43.729> but<00:04:44.449> not<00:04:44.479> too

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
and maybe he'll feel strong but not too

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.650 
and maybe he'll feel strong but not too
strong<00:04:45.110> I<00:04:45.440> gave<00:04:46.400> it<00:04:46.550> it<00:04:46.699> really<00:04:47.120> did<00:04:47.389> give<00:04:47.570> it

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
strong I gave it it really did give it

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.150 
strong I gave it it really did give it
shine<00:04:47.960> and<00:04:49.270> it<00:04:50.270> actually<00:04:50.300> works<00:04:50.870> so<00:04:51.800> I<00:04:51.830> give

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
shine and it actually works so I give

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:58.020 
shine and it actually works so I give
this<00:04:52.370> a<00:04:52.610> 5<00:04:53.330> so<00:04:53.930> this<00:04:53.960> is<00:04:54.349> just<00:04:54.500> my<00:04:54.800> take<00:04:55.400> on<00:04:55.460> it<00:04:55.840> I

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
this a 5 so this is just my take on it I

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.350 
this a 5 so this is just my take on it I
probably<00:04:59.030> get<00:04:59.360> it<00:04:59.479> like<00:04:59.660> a<00:04:59.690> six<00:05:01.120> another<00:05:02.120> point

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
probably get it like a six another point

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.379 
probably get it like a six another point
because<00:05:02.900> it's<00:05:03.199> 20<00:05:03.530> is<00:05:03.710> 20<00:05:03.979> is<00:05:04.220> 20<00:05:04.400> ounce<00:05:04.729> for
