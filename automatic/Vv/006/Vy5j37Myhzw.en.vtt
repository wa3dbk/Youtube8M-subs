worked up over the only reason I can
think<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.259> happened<00:01:31.710> is<00:01:31.799> because<00:01:31.979> he

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
think that that happened is because he

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.100 
think that that happened is because he
knows<00:01:32.610> he<00:01:32.640> got<00:01:33.060> caught<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.450> got<00:01:33.630> called<00:01:33.930> up

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
knows he got caught and got called up

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.660 
knows he got caught and got called up
for<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.470> that's<00:01:34.860> why<00:01:35.070> he<00:01:35.189> got<00:01:35.369> all<00:01:35.490> defensive

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
for it that's why he got all defensive

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.999 
for it that's why he got all defensive
because<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.750> reality<00:01:36.930> if<00:01:37.409> he<00:01:37.560> knew<00:01:37.710> there<00:01:37.860> was

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
because in reality if he knew there was

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.710 
because in reality if he knew there was
nothing<00:01:38.369> he<00:01:38.460> was<00:01:38.549> laughing<00:01:38.820> about<00:01:39.030> he<00:01:39.329> could

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
nothing he was laughing about he could

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.359 
nothing he was laughing about he could
have<00:01:39.780> told<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.320> shared<00:01:40.710> with<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.340> entire
