00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.400
 hello I am igor dancers prof 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.250
 choreographer and creator of swing at the 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.780
 easy dance to dance with style and 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.969
 in this video I will share with 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.500
 you all who's swinging or this 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.420
 new dance trend 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.640
 it's been twenty years that I teach with 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.470
 more than 25 thousand hours of lessons and more 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.359
 a dozen shows 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.430
 choreographed and obviously I have the 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.260
 pleasure and happiness of dancing and 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.789
 to burst on all the music of 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.560
 dance but you have already arrived 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.230
 to go in the evening to hear a music 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.180
 super catchy of not being able 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.219
 dance on it and therefore sit 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.940
 or dance alone while you adore 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.460
 to dance as a couple 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.620
 it happened to me and even too much 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.770
 often and the reason is simple 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.620
 I took several years to find out 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.600
 she lives in the tempo of music 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.430
 the tempo is the speed of the music 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.890
 and of course most of the pieces 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.170
 current david guetta pitbull 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.289
 the black eyed peas this tempo is 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.699
 between 32 and 36 measurements among this is at 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.920
 say on behalf of your forte that you have 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.539
 for a minute and party for 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.210
 dance in cha cha cha or west coast 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.580
 swing is too fast in Roussel 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.659
 simple is too slow and in tango we have 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.909
 rarely place 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.159
 it is by noting this lack we have 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.170
 decided to fill it by creating the fridge 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.640
 it allows you to dance easily and 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.400
 with style on all music 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.620
 current is a mix of rock'n'roll 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.810
 tango of salsa 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.420
 all figures are created for sedan 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.190
