00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
prochaine by looping so we have to get

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.590 
prochaine by looping so we have to get
our<00:00:21.480> loop<00:00:21.689> started<00:00:22.260> so<00:00:23.070> i'm<00:00:23.130> going<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.600> take

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
our loop started so i'm going to take

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.419 
our loop started so i'm going to take
the<00:00:24.779> yarn<00:00:25.400> wrap<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.609> up<00:00:26.699> my<00:00:26.910> forefinger<00:00:27.480> and

yarn we're going to push forward and
we're<00:00:41.430> going<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.700> make<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.450> knot<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:43.980> we<00:00:44.190> have<00:00:44.340> a

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
we're going to make a knot so we have a

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.110 
we're going to make a knot so we have a
whole<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:45.120> start<00:00:45.450> our<00:00:45.629> quotient<00:00:46.879> now<00:00:47.879> that

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
whole to start our quotient now that

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.450 
whole to start our quotient now that
we've<00:00:48.300> made<00:00:48.510> our<00:00:48.660> loop<00:00:48.960> we're<00:00:49.739> going<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.190> take

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
we've made our loop we're going to take

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.900 
we've made our loop we're going to take
our<00:00:50.960> crochet<00:00:51.960> hook<00:00:52.230> we're<00:00:53.039> going<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.370> insert

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
our crochet hook we're going to insert

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.959 
our crochet hook we're going to insert
it<00:00:54.120> into<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.750> loop<00:00:55.160> and<00:00:56.160> we're<00:00:56.489> going<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.699> pull

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
it into the loop and we're going to pull

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.869 
it into the loop and we're going to pull
the<00:00:57.210> long<00:00:57.449> hand<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.410> yarn<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:59.609> we<00:00:59.730> can

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
the long hand of the yarn so we can

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.869 
the long hand of the yarn so we can
tighten<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.300> up<00:01:00.390> not<00:01:00.780> too<00:01:01.050> tight<00:01:01.670> but<00:01:02.670> just

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
tighten it up not too tight but just

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.679 
tighten it up not too tight but just
tight<00:01:03.120> enough<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.510> keep<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.930> on<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.799> hook<00:01:05.689> so

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
tight enough to keep it on the hook so

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.270 
tight enough to keep it on the hook so
now<00:01:06.869> we're<00:01:07.200> going<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.650> do<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:08.100> chain<00:01:08.850> six<00:01:10.040> so<00:01:11.040> I

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
now we're going to do a chain six so I

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.080 
now we're going to do a chain six so I
like<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.670> take<00:01:12.030> my<00:01:12.090> forefinger<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.580> hold<00:01:14.580> this
