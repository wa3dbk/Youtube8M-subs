00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.610
 also the person who knows that within it 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.140
 There is something that can be triggered. 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.440

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:12.420
 support can be found but 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:16.920
 an hour this does not hold up any longer 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:22.509
 usually happens when the person 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:26.470
 is to reach a certain age or 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:29.679
 through punctual phenomena that this 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:32.020
 anxiety trigger can happen 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:34.270
 such as a marriage is fair in the

 A Panic Disorder Happens 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.159
 associated with depression some psychiatrists 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.859
 consider even the 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.600
 panic disorder the kind of 

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:51.810
 ink depression because it is always 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.479
 associated with certain symptoms 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.799
 depressive symptoms at other times 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:03.030
 people can also see the 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:05.099
 trigger of extreme anxiety can

 be the birth of a child 

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:10.349

 regression when the father or mother 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:19.709
 mother in a way that the person feels 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:23.790
 harassed by anxiety and archaic 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:26.220
 primitive if she tried to stress and 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.560
 that somehow at that time 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.849
 precipitates in the direction of consciousness 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.220
 then the person has to do some 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:35.129

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.920
 the suffering is very great and one 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:40.109
 classic treatment indeed the best and 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.390
 more indicated because psychotherapy and 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:45.000
 medication 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:47.310
 of course there are situations where the 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.230
 individual feels capable of facing the 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.620
 own favor without the use of 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.780
 meditation is a possibility but not 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:03:01.230
 general when there is a possibility of 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:04.169
 risk of prescription is medicated and 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.299
 you should seek a psychiatrist 

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:08.599
 to be attended what has nothing of 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.599
 waves
