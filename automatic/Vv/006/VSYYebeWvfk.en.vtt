00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.650
 good afternoon friends good afternoon guests 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.639
 my channel 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:12.450
 thank you for staying with me you 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:15.949
 ask what led me to the epicenter and 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:19.980
 what is common between a car and 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:21.660
 construction stores answer the question 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.640
 simple if you broke the pipe 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.859
 intercooler 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.099
 if you have a turbine car this is not 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.480
 may be not only car mersedes 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.180
 any other car will not 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:38.450
 call brand is this nipple 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.450
 if on mercedes 2 and 3 here it is 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:48.650
 now show you my arm here 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.490
 will see 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.490
 crack and 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:59.750
 a pipe that pumps air from 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:03.580
 large pressure pipe burst possible 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.330
 in principle, to purchase this pipe 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:09.500
 auto parts store 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:13.880
 but it is expensive the price starts from 500 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:16.220
 hryvnia as an option you can call in 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.530
 big store because i was already in 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.440
 two supermarkets and did not find there that 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.619
 spare parts that we need and what we need 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.850
 need we need need here such a knee 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.520
 well why such 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:32.510
 precisely with such an angle of 45 degrees because 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:35.240
 like you see here but the angle 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.830
 small if you have a straight section 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:43.340
 you will take 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:45.500
 knee diameter up to diameter 45 diameter 45 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.710
 if you have a straight section you can 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.960
 take a straight pipe cut if you have 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:54.470
 let's say it happened here then 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:59.240
 who are you bend well pick you need to push 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:02.810
 and is getting a knee right now we will start 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.450
 this repair i shoot the whole process not 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.909
 I can because my hands will be busy but I forgot 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:12.340
 say be sure to get 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.340
 and take two good and mutants 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.470
 in order to 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:27.420
 still need you will need a key on 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:34.190
 13 in order to 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:38.940
 unscrew these bolts one two three 4 5 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:42.750
 six to take this one 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:46.140
 screwdriver tighten the screwdriver and 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:50.069
 right here under the headlights we put here 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:52.890
 you two screws we remove this 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:57.180
 unscrew the lattice after the lattice 6 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:03:00.870
 bolts remove the bar and then we have 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.060
 here you can access the socket 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:07.890
 intercooler which is attached after 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:12.420
 radiator but since in principle I think 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:14.910
 that can handle without removing this bar I 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.799
 try to do it all on the spot but it 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.220
 what happens then I'll take off show you 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:23.640
 let's start the process so guys 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.380
 prepare any already occurred yet 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.700
 one little tip before 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.620
 will cut the pipe 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.170
 here you see a crack yes where is she 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.230
 ends where it starts for 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.299
 order to cut straight through the pipe 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.340
 Take for Lenka or here I have 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:41.070
 masking tape 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.430
 wind and and you will get smooth 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.150
 cut 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:48.170
 naturally take a sharp knife after 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.280
 how do you cut 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:55.100
 expose 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.819
 we are an example given a piece of the knee 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.610
 dress two clamps 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:02.490
 on the one hand on the other hand the place 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:05.069
 collect and everything will be okay 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:08.330
 order here she does not have to see 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.330
 shoot this bar 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:14.660
 since i already had a rush here 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:17.269
 nozzle and here the vitic is inserted already 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:20.299
 knee I had to unscrew the yoke and in 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:23.000
 principle pipe in my hands and so I 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.880
 continue to cut out the repair is finished 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.830
 You can look at the work 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:33.200
 we all turned out great everything is beautiful 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:38.139
 the only advice would be see the crack 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:40.610
 yes what it has increased somewhere 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:43.430
 centimeter to three centimeters in order 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.889
 that it is as small as possible is strongly 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.490
 do not drive much please torn 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:50.330
 branch pipe 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:53.940
 how it breaks I think many people hear when 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:57.690
 adding gas under load during acceleration 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.729
 you hear the whistle from under the hood 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.849
 options or you have torn pipe or 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:06.120
 same forehead amanita incidentally here is a yoke which 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:07.530
 I took today at the epicenter he was 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:12.419
 diameter 40 60 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:13.770
 he is too small guys take 5070 is good 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:18.060
 that i am near here 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:20.849
 it's 1 and I had two in the trunk 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.620
 starting clamp why are they in the trunk 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:25.740
 lay two spare yoke as u 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:30.659
 I had one such incident on the road 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:33.479
 just when I popped collar and 

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:36.530
 the track was very hard somewhere 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:40.440
 found when it had to be repaired 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:43.310
 it took a lot of time 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:46.520
 well spent and since then in 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:49.949
 the trunk I always drive 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.870
 two clamps at least just in case 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:54.000
