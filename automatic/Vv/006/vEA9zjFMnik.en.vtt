00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.440
 good your fears to a new video we 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:05.210
 says what I thought was pretty 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.819
 surprising and really is who does not 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.980
 I finish believing in him have appeared 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:12.860
 Pretty spectacular is a bit old 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:16.279
 it's from this December but good some 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:20.390
 the dates on day 12 others on the day 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:21.800
 18 others on the 20th other entities but 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.019
 basically, it seems that it has 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.019
 past this month of December has passed 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:29.900
 marked 99 by twitter and I thought 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:32.449
 it was pretty frightening samples 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.399
 in a certain sense not when you read it 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:37.399
 quite impacts this by combining and 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.980
 It seems that in a cybercafÃ© in Lima 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:43.430
 peru a boy while you play league of 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.690
 legends was stabbed as normal 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.859
 up here good is not normal 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.410
 logically that having a stab 

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:50.390
 while you are playing but the normal thing is 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.359
 how good you go to the general hospital and 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:56.390
 the hospital because the guy does not seem to be 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:58.550
 that ended the game was to finish the 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.500
 game the league of legends and good your 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.899
 answer is that it was more important 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.190
 of the starter was my promo of 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.160
 bronze 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:10.570
 the silver me the truth is to flip a 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:13.850
 little bit to be a little sick 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:18.560
 we are already talking about a person who does not 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:22.250
 I reason good advice in the 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:25.610
 hospitals plus the most mega logical the most 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.500
 mega start to decide on editions 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.210
 of case the age that you no longer know the 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.990
 reasons why this boy received 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:38.060
 a stab we approve I do not know 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:43.520
 you can not keep playing I do not know what 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:45.470
 we have to define it so good 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.030
 I do not know if this gift news is false 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.549
 there really is male as quite the 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.990
 many likes in media like that looking for it 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.789
 looking for it clear 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.280
 without looking for it you do not find it not the 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:58.130
 typical news that comes to you and is already 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.689
 it's not hard to be difficult to 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.119
 find no has not been news that 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:04.850
 has run so much the voice or so 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:07.399
 less us here for Spain not run it 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.280
 both the voice and in the usa - I do not usually look 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.170
 the news and other so good 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.209
 I do not know anyone I went to peru and others 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.650
 who will tell me then it is real because it is false 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.670
 for I have not heard anything as I am that 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.500
 heard because there is a kid who has 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.989
 passed this news in the dictionary 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:25.340
 December 2014 in a newspaper seems 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:27.019
 it seems to be also so I do not know for 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.580
 flipar I do not know if it 's real or false with 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.200
 I have this with this news I have 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.540
 many unreal or false doubts that I 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.510
 It seems so incredible that drying 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.830
 balls in serious statements no longer me 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.090
 I can not believe it 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.410
 lately, I can love myself 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.930
 some pretty things 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.830
 to freak out so nothing we go on the 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.830
 next life by
