00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:20.289
 the port surrounded by the Portuguese Portuguese ports suffer from silver that 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.289
 pass the study on everything for everything 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.779
 here and so it's not worth 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.199
 leaves the front for the selection can pass 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.509
 the future of the bank 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:33.890
 but here for me to achieve 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.330
 can battle to win the game can end up in the first group 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.520
 but from above 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.150
 put the team on the attack 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.890
 but you are very dumb 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.320
 Brazilian politicians every year you 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.559
 can win the game 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.530
 just the christmas cards 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.530
 we want a spokesman for this team that you obey 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.260
 I thought it was spain 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.880
 eight points away from home 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.880
 we still have a great player if spared from the match 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.440
 so I think it will be better in the field 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.840
 reached the goal 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.080
 the plateau 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.100
 Cristiano Ronaldo 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.100
 and show what they are not like 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.490
 costa warned 2 2 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:20.650
 How do you stay? 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.840
 now the jet to attack people as a consultant 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.050
 should have placed 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.050
 yes because it does not say what was the game was always on the satellite 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.780
 If it's okay, it's not all right, the whole retractable team, you got twitter. 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.160
 the passport to the final in the case of the middle attack everything I propose 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.830
 hope so 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.270
 I know I have but the one who has the advantage 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.580
 the tie by 1 to 1 with the students 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.900
 So choose my name, let it go. 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.230
 is competent and soon this team represents this goal has no 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:52.679
 for who ever cnt 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:54.250

 summer 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:15.869
 paulo azevedo game of italy 

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:18.899
