00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 the first option with the subway this season and I 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.189
 I think that this trend will hold 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.920
 not one season this sweater 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.590
 oversight what does it mean it's solid 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.049
 loose sweater straight cut and smooth and 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.380
 weave it can be called 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.750
 the base thing of this season with one 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.019
 parties, he ideally complements many 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.019
 bright trends on the other will make them more 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:30.890
 adapted to our climate so 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.989
 Consider what to wear a free sweater 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.969
 First of all it looks great with 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.140
 various models of flared 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:43.379
 skirts to the knee or shorter also especially 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:47.399
 will look bold with leather skirts 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:50.989
 or from fabrics with prints and patterns like 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:54.660
 in the photo on my left very 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:57.030
 effectively and not quite familiar to us because 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.520
 that we are used to of course something that 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:04.619
 we usually wear a sweater with jeans and pants 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:07.770
 and this season is relevant to fill 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.420
 skirt and the skirt of the a-silhouette as on 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.210
 example 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.950
 besides, it will look great 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.189
 such a sweater with a pencil skirt length 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.549
 knees especially if this skirt will 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.860
 from leather or from other pronounced texture 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.490
 that is, from a fabric with some bright 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.460
 interesting texture 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.750
 You can also wear a sweater with a skirt 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.329
 maxi &amp; mandy 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.990
 Of course, one thing is that such a skirt 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.390
 not all is suitable firstly in connection 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.670
 midi skirt growth 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.770
 as pictured only girls 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.170
 very tall normal that's it 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.220
 model looks in life is so 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.299
 skirt can 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.500
 shorten growth shorten legs and 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:55.590
 create down proportions of the figure 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.409
 visually and also need to possess very 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.509
 beautiful leg shape to the 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.909
 skirts looked harmonious and 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.460
 really decorated so try 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.350
 experiment measure and and draw 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.270
 attention to the whole was not only 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.580
 fashionable but also decorated you 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.730
 and of course such a sweater can 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.290
 to wear with straight or loose pants 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.070
 it will be especially interesting to look with 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.470
 print or embroidery as income on the right 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:27.680
 plus note that we combine 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.020
 with loose sweaters things fit 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.870
 pencil skirt looks great and 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:36.820
 stresses slim hips pants 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:39.110
 also narrowed perfectly fit 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.360
 so it balances 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.460
 kit can not in no way 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.340
 combine two bulk things at the same time 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:49.490
 we are sure if for something volumetric 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.240
 in a set we combine it with a thing 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:56.350
 figure and so this is not 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.350
 increases your volume visually
