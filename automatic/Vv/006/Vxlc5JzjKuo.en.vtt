00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 why do my name is jockey today I come to 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.270
 share with you things I come 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.309
 above all to share wisdom I come to 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.349
 recommend some things that I think 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.150
 you must know and if you already know them by 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.740
 any reason so that you know 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:19.050
 which I also like so without 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.789
 more we can start the first one right 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.500
 thing I want to recommend you is a 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.869
 application and the application is called 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.699
 inbox and is made by google we could 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.980
 say that it is the logical evolution of 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.840
 gmail is the google mail of always 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.290
 but it also has something that has 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.840
 delighted because I am a mess with 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:39.329
 the reminders dates things that I 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.160
 they always forget things on the mobile 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.870
 in plan with acronyms or in the hand and 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.399
 later I do not know what it means and it is that 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.989
 he has never been able to organize me with 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.700
 mobile calendars to me I do not 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.260
 They serve, I do not understand, they do not work 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.670
 but as I told you earlier what to me 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.469
 I like the most part of the calendar 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.719
 because being integrated into the 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.660
 own application allows us to put 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.129
 reminders that basically tell us 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.199
 with a calendar in fact even 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.239
 we can postpone emails and tell us 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.369
 let us sound an alarm when we have 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.240
 to answer it for example remember me 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.009
 that within 8 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.960
 must answer it or tomorrow morning 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.100
 I have to answer it because I am a 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.689
 disaster and as I said before 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.880
 I always forget to answer emails 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.640
 and I have things pointed and then never 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.960
 I hear nothing so inbox very good 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.149
 I work the next thing that I 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.890
 I want to talk to you about this and you 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.409
 you will say what the fuck is this, because they are waxes 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.500
 of the hair that is a kind of hair 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.970
 but dry and you ask me 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.950
 pussy but if you do not have cloth in the 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.580
 hair and the guys calm down time 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.110
 weather 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.090
 everything has its explanation as it turns out 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.759
 that the boys stop smoking that although 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.830
 It sounds like seal fav really 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.509
 Believe me it has nothing to do with this 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.799
 they contacted me and I 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.289
 they said hey we 're going to send you some 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.899
 hair products and you can 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:50.729
 say that they seem to you and plan 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.289
 So it's really cool fucking if I get them 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.330
 you command me well I love that 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:55.950
 it happens that coke is stupid and like that is 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.229
 fool since they thought they were going 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.179
 to send conditioning shampoos or 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.310
 things of those that I although I do not use use 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:03.659
 of the normal day of all life then 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.030
 it came well then and they send it to me because 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.069
 I could say that such a good result does not 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.700
 they were conditioners or shampoos and nothing 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.379
 was 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.760
 close to the hair then clear me when 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.810
 I find waxes in my house 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.870
 I say good, I would have to use them 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.629
 then I tried to make some looks 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.580
 so that you can see the guru part that 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:23.220
 I have inside the first look I made it 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.530
 with this wax that is wax and more light 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.970
 that he has then nothing grabs very little and 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.970
 this is what has come out that has 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.440
 come out well a thing very or very in plan if 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.239
 comes a gust of wind because you do not know 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.069
 the hairs are upside down but the truth 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:38.310
 is that it's pretty good because it has 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.510
 let me modify my hair at my whim and 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.170
 now is where the funny part comes from 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.690
 because they also sent me a super high 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.730
 hold my finish wants to be what 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.530
 hold on that curves come because this 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.390
 not even if you pass a tornado over 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.459
 then it moves it says it did me 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.750

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.630

 our screens see me to my roll a 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.730
 little butt but the truth is that I 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:05.130
 I'm freaking out because there was no god 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.230

 I recommend it 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.540
 especially because you know it's a girl that 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.310
 she has always wanted to be a writer 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.109
 he wanted to write to publish a 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.299
 book has already gotten his dreams like this 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.919

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.330
 review of someone or some opinion has 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.009
