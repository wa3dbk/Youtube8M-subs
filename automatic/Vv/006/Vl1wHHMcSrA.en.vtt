measurement is not difficult in fact
it's<00:00:26.670> pretty<00:00:26.849> easy<00:00:27.090> but<00:00:27.660> is<00:00:27.750> that<00:00:27.869> much<00:00:28.109> easier

average may be 14 inches to 18 inches

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.240 
average may be 14 inches to 18 inches
but<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.140> range<00:01:34.380> can<00:01:34.590> differ<00:01:34.799> dramatically

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
but that range can differ dramatically

but that range can differ dramatically
we're<00:01:35.460> all<00:01:35.640> different<00:01:35.880> it's<00:01:36.750> important<00:01:37.530> to

we're all different it's important to

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.190 
we're all different it's important to
actually<00:01:37.860> take<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.369> measurement<00:01:39.200> height

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
actually take that measurement height

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.020 
actually take that measurement height
feels<00:01:40.680> like<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.070> should<00:01:41.250> be<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.400> determinant

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
feels like it should be a determinant

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.240 
feels like it should be a determinant
and<00:01:42.240> isn't<00:01:42.899> necessarily<00:01:43.409> so<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:44.009> could<00:01:44.159> be

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
and isn't necessarily so you could be

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.219 
and isn't necessarily so you could be
six<00:01:44.490> foot<00:01:44.670> six<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.149> be<00:01:45.540> all<00:01:45.689> legs<00:01:45.930> have<00:01:46.200> a

longer than average torso measurement

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.999 
longer than average torso measurement
again<00:01:51.299> important<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.020> actually<00:01:52.439> take<00:01:52.710> that

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
again important to actually take that

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.310 
again important to actually take that
measurement
