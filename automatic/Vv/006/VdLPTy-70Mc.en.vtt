00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
with the skid steer we burn about a full

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.270 
with the skid steer we burn about a full
tank<00:02:57.000> of<00:02:57.150> fuel<00:02:57.210> in<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.350> wheel<00:02:58.530> loader<00:02:58.800> we<00:02:59.040> only

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
tank of fuel in the wheel loader we only

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.640 
tank of fuel in the wheel loader we only
burn<00:02:59.490> about<00:02:59.760> a<00:02:59.790> third<00:03:00.090> of<00:03:00.210> a<00:03:00.330> tank<00:03:00.540> if<00:03:01.260> you<00:03:01.470> did

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
burn about a third of a tank if you did

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.090 
burn about a third of a tank if you did
it<00:03:01.770> get<00:03:01.860> into<00:03:02.040> tight<00:03:02.370> spaces<00:03:03.000> but<00:03:03.690> I<00:03:04.410> think

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
it get into tight spaces but I think

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.450 
it get into tight spaces but I think
it's<00:03:05.250> faster<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.910> sort<00:03:06.900> with<00:03:07.320> it<00:03:07.500> I<00:03:07.740> also<00:03:08.100> like

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
it's faster to sort with it I also like

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:09.500 
it's faster to sort with it I also like
that<00:03:08.490> we<00:03:08.790> could<00:03:08.940> use<00:03:09.060> a<00:03:09.090> skid<00:03:09.480> steer

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
that we could use a skid steer

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.300 
that we could use a skid steer
