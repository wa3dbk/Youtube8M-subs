00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
and pretty much all you have to do is

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.319 
and pretty much all you have to do is
just<00:00:34.920> run<00:00:35.340> down<00:00:35.489> this<00:00:35.610> hill<00:00:35.790> at<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:35.940> beginning

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
just run down this hill at the beginning

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.760 
just run down this hill at the beginning
take<00:00:36.600> out<00:00:36.750> all<00:00:36.899> this<00:00:37.050> initial<00:00:37.500> wave<00:00:37.649> of

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
take out all this initial wave of

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.580 
take out all this initial wave of
enemies<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.690> hook<00:00:39.690> around<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.140> corner<00:00:40.469> to

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
the left and up the hill I know reach

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.420 
the left and up the hill I know reach
point<00:00:43.469> where<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:43.680> have<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.980> defend<00:00:44.190> two

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
point where you have to defend two

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.940 
point where you have to defend two
generators<00:00:44.879> there<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:46.020> not<00:00:46.410> much<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.920> this

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
generators there is not much to this

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.709 
generators there is not much to this
achievement<00:00:47.370> really<00:00:47.760> at<00:00:47.850> all<00:00:48.000> especially<00:00:48.329> if

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
achievement really at all especially if

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.020 
achievement really at all especially if
you're<00:00:48.840> using<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.289> Mantis<00:00:49.710> because<00:00:50.640> on

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
you're using the Mantis because on

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.910 
you're using the Mantis because on
heroic<00:00:51.539> as<00:00:51.719> I'm<00:00:51.899> doing<00:00:52.079> here<00:00:52.500> because<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:52.800> took

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
heroic as I'm doing here because I took

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.310 
heroic as I'm doing here because I took
the<00:00:53.190> easy<00:00:53.340> way<00:00:53.489> out<00:00:53.719> you're<00:00:54.719> pretty<00:00:54.960> powerful

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
the easy way out you're pretty powerful

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.959 
the easy way out you're pretty powerful
compared<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.070> enemies<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.610> as<00:00:56.730> long<00:00:56.820> as

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
compared to the enemies and as long as

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.670 
compared to the enemies and as long as
you<00:00:57.030> don't<00:00:57.210> get<00:00:57.329> too<00:00:57.390> crazy<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.140> leave

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
you don't get too crazy and leave

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.590 
you don't get too crazy and leave
yourself<00:00:58.890> open<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.940> lot<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.180> enemies

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
yourself open to a lot of enemies

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.510 
yourself open to a lot of enemies
blasting<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.230> at<00:01:01.350> once<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:02.250> really

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
blasting you at once you really

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.460 
blasting you at once you really
shouldn't<00:01:02.789> have<00:01:02.850> any<00:01:03.149> difficulty<00:01:03.660> surviving

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
shouldn't have any difficulty surviving

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.899 
shouldn't have any difficulty surviving
the<00:01:04.559> ways<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.920> enemies<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.430> protecting<00:01:05.880> the

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
the ways of enemies and protecting the

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.600 
the ways of enemies and protecting the
generators<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.659> think<00:01:07.350> one<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.770> my<00:01:07.890> generators

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
generators I think one of my generators

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.880 
generators I think one of my generators
may<00:01:09.030> have<00:01:09.240> taken<00:01:09.420> about<00:01:09.780> five<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:10.290> ten<00:01:10.470> percent

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
may have taken about five to ten percent

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.740 
may have taken about five to ten percent
of<00:01:11.040> its<00:01:11.159> damage<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.790> other<00:01:12.540> one<00:01:12.720> just

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
of its damage and the other one just

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.530 
of its damage and the other one just
takes<00:01:13.170> like<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.380> little<00:01:13.740> sliver<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.250> damage<00:01:14.729> so

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
takes like a little sliver of damage so

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.300 
takes like a little sliver of damage so
it's<00:01:15.869> like<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.229> said<00:01:16.439> it's<00:01:16.619> really<00:01:17.040> really<00:01:17.280> easy

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
it's like I said it's really really easy

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.560 
it's like I said it's really really easy
i<00:01:17.820> did<00:01:18.390> this<00:01:18.540> up<00:01:18.960> solo<00:01:19.650> on<00:01:19.890> heroic<00:01:20.400> but<00:01:21.119> if<00:01:21.390> you

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
i did this up solo on heroic but if you

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.109 
i did this up solo on heroic but if you
are<00:01:21.689> struggling<00:01:22.049> if<00:01:22.350> you're<00:01:22.500> not<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:23.119> veteran

turn on these two turrets here near the
generators<00:01:34.860> at<00:01:35.070> one<00:01:35.220> point<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:36.329> may<00:01:36.509> help

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
generators at one point that may help
