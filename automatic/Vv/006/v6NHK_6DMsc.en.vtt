people<00:01:43.560> on<00:01:43.679> my<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:43.859> use<00:01:44.070> most<00:01:44.280> of<00:01:44.399> time<00:01:45.289> and

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
people on my I use most of time and

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:50.569 
people on my I use most of time and
that's<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:47.240> simply<00:01:48.240> just<00:01:48.450> start<00:01:49.200> skipping<00:01:49.590> and

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
that's to simply just start skipping and
