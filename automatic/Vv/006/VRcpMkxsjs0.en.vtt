00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:36.780

 on the inspector of the nature reserve assures feed 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.640
 animals in the forest just need to be different 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.950
 they will lose their fear of man and 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.280

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.040

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.490

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.860
