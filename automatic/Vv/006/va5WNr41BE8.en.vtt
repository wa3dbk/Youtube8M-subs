to get around this i found a way to get
around<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.329> global<00:01:00.719> cooldown<00:01:00.980> get<00:01:01.980> things

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
around the global cooldown get things

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.549 
around the global cooldown get things
done<00:01:02.609> quicker<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.899> what<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.229> want<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.500> be

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.109 
done quicker so what you want to be
doing<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.489> need<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.700> use<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.869> language<00:01:07.170> of

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
doing is you need to use the language of

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.810 
doing is you need to use the language of
macro<00:01:09.119> so<00:01:09.860> basically<00:01:10.860> you've<00:01:11.070> got<00:01:11.220> type<00:01:11.520> stuff

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
macro so basically you've got type stuff

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.330 
macro so basically you've got type stuff
cast<00:01:12.330> charge<00:01:12.720> in<00:01:13.400> cast<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.880> losses<00:01:15.540> smash

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
then cast oh I didn't work some reason I

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.630 
then cast oh I didn't work some reason I
don't<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.380> don't<00:01:28.409> know<00:01:28.650> why<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:28.860> can<00:01:29.159> work<00:01:29.340> i

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
don't I don't know why that can work i

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.719 
don't I don't know why that can work i
mean<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:31.049> moves<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:31.500> fast<00:01:31.530> it's<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.430> little

brilliant<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.430> mean<00:01:47.579> look<00:01:47.759> how<00:01:48.149> fast<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.720> it's

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
brilliant I mean look how fast is it's

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.800 
brilliant I mean look how fast is it's
that<00:01:49.380> it's<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.799> best<00:01:50.070> way<00:01:50.369> I've<00:01:51.090> found<00:01:51.149> to

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
that it's the best way I've found to

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.319

play World of Warcraft at all I mean
because<00:01:54.450> it's<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.869> language<00:01:55.049> of<00:01:55.380> macro<00:01:55.860> so

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
because it's the language of macro so

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.670 
because it's the language of macro so
it's<00:01:56.640> got<00:01:56.850> its<00:01:57.119> got<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.360> be<00:01:57.450> quicker<00:01:57.750> I'd<00:01:58.110> that
