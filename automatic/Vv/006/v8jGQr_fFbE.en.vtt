of vegetables I like eating them fresh

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.159 
of vegetables I like eating them fresh
rather<00:03:19.040> than<00:03:19.280> like<00:03:19.549> cooked<00:03:20.450> if<00:03:20.750> you<00:03:20.900> eat<00:03:21.019> them

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:21.169 
rather than like cooked if you eat them

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:22.599 
rather than like cooked if you eat them
fresh<00:03:21.319> it's<00:03:21.590> a<00:03:21.650> lot<00:03:21.799> better<00:03:21.919> than<00:03:22.160> you<00:03:22.310> as

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:22.609 
fresh it's a lot better than you as

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:24.009 
fresh it's a lot better than you as
opposed<00:03:23.180> to<00:03:23.269> the<00:03:23.359> cooking<00:03:23.690> them<00:03:23.810> and<00:03:23.930> like

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
opposed to the cooking them and like

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:26.319 
opposed to the cooking them and like

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
butter and everything like that so if

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:28.479 
butter and everything like that so if
you<00:03:26.419> eat<00:03:26.510> them<00:03:26.660> raw<00:03:26.870> fresh<00:03:27.590> definitely<00:03:28.370> good
