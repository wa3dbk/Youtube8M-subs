00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.429 
iphone and then it didn't happen for
like<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.369> few<00:01:53.700> days<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.149> after<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.960> few<00:01:55.020> days<00:01:55.290> or

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
like a few days and after a few days or

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.560 
like a few days and after a few days or
so<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:55.710> started<00:01:55.979> happening<00:01:56.130> again<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.880> when

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570

it happens it does happen quite

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.550 
it happens it does happen quite
frequently<00:02:01.939> especially<00:02:02.939> if<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:04.320> just<00:02:04.469> happens

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
frequently especially if it just happens

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.499 
frequently especially if it just happens
really<00:02:05.159> frequently<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:05.729> can't<00:02:06.000> really<00:02:06.149> tell

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
really frequently you can't really tell

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.440 
really frequently you can't really tell
when<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:06.990> happens<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.439> just<00:02:07.469> happens

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
when it happens it just happens

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.860

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
to the guy and he said that's really odd

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:08.650 
to the guy and he said that's really odd
it's<00:03:07.370> something<00:03:07.640> that<00:03:07.790> he's<00:03:07.910> never<00:03:08.150> even<00:03:08.450> seen

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
it's something that he's never even seen

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.009 
it's something that he's never even seen
before<00:03:08.930> and<00:03:09.500> of<00:03:10.190> course<00:03:10.220> it's<00:03:10.700> better<00:03:10.970> for<00:03:11.420> the

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
before and of course it's better for the

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.220 
before and of course it's better for the
genius<00:03:12.560> bar<00:03:13.239> specialist<00:03:14.239> to<00:03:14.480> experience<00:03:15.109> it

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
genius bar specialist to experience it

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.660

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
himself but you know that's really

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:17.979 
himself but you know that's really
difficult<00:03:16.850> because<00:03:17.269> it<00:03:17.480> happens<00:03:17.840> really

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
difficult because it happens really

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.190 
difficult because it happens really
randomly<00:03:18.620> and<00:03:19.090> but<00:03:20.090> luckily<00:03:20.540> it<00:03:20.810> didn't

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
randomly and but luckily it didn't

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.629 
randomly and but luckily it didn't
happen<00:03:21.230> whilst<00:03:21.739> he<00:03:21.920> was<00:03:21.950> using<00:03:22.250> it<00:03:22.489> it<00:03:22.609> just

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:22.639 
happen whilst he was using it it just

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:24.340 
happen whilst he was using it it just
turned<00:03:23.060> off<00:03:23.180> by<00:03:23.420> itself<00:03:23.569> and<00:03:23.930> he<00:03:24.019> said<00:03:24.200> it's

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
turned off by itself and he said it's

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.920 
turned off by itself and he said it's
really<00:03:24.560> weird<00:03:24.739> so<00:03:25.459> we<00:03:25.609> decided<00:03:25.970> to<00:03:26.090> do<00:03:26.269> a<00:03:26.299> dfu

don't know if it's a software problem or
a<00:05:42.440> hardware<00:05:43.010> problem<00:05:43.039> but<00:05:43.640> I'm<00:05:44.060> more

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
a hardware problem but I'm more

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:47.830 
convinced that it's a software problem
now<00:05:46.580> even<00:05:46.820> though<00:05:46.940> they<00:05:47.120> have<00:05:47.240> replaced<00:05:47.630> my

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:51.890 
convinced because it's a different

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.969 
convinced because it's a different
iphone<00:05:52.190> so<00:05:53.180> you<00:05:53.240> know<00:05:53.570> this<00:05:53.750> is<00:05:53.810> a<00:05:53.960> sort<00:05:54.830> of<00:05:54.890> a

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.279 
out I I expected them to replace the
phone<00:06:04.729> for<00:06:04.970> me<00:06:05.060> in<00:06:05.150> the<00:06:05.539> beginning<00:06:05.660> but<00:06:05.960> of

phone for me in the beginning but of

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:07.779 
phone for me in the beginning but of
course<00:06:06.530> they<00:06:06.740> can't<00:06:06.919> just<00:06:07.010> randomly<00:06:07.250> do<00:06:07.610> that

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:07.789 
course they can't just randomly do that

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:09.070 
course they can't just randomly do that
because<00:06:07.970> they<00:06:08.210> have<00:06:08.360> to<00:06:08.479> know<00:06:08.660> that<00:06:08.840> it<00:06:08.960> is<00:06:09.050> a

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 
because they have to know that it is a
