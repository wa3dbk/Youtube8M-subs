00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
performance wise it was kind of lacking

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
lot of powder and they just didn't build

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.609

think<00:02:56.130> the<00:02:56.490> packaging<00:02:56.970> is<00:02:57.150> quite<00:02:57.600> bulky<00:02:58.080> the

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
think the packaging is quite bulky the

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.130 
think the packaging is quite bulky the
eyeshadows<00:02:59.460> in<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.880> palette<00:03:00.240> are<00:03:00.390> quite<00:03:00.750> big

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
eyeshadows in the palette are quite big

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.470 
eyeshadows in the palette are quite big
though<00:03:01.380> the<00:03:01.920> naked<00:03:02.220> palettes<00:03:02.550> have<00:03:02.880> twelve

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
though the naked palettes have twelve

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.410 
though the naked palettes have twelve
eyes<00:03:03.690> shadows<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:04.610> these<00:03:05.610> have<00:03:05.910> ten<00:03:06.210> it

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
eyes shadow whereas I believe the naked

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.290 
eyes shadow whereas I believe the naked
palettes<00:03:14.160> that's<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.550> full<00:03:14.760> size<00:03:14.970> Urban

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
like the new to pile had a lot more

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.570 
like the new to pile had a lot more
mattes<00:03:33.270> in<00:03:33.600> this<00:03:33.990> palette<00:03:34.530> but<00:03:35.070> I<00:03:35.100> felt<00:03:35.430> like

the eyeshadows were a lot more powdery
and<00:03:38.130> they<00:03:38.550> just<00:03:38.790> didn't<00:03:39.600> perform<00:03:39.780> well<00:03:40.110> on<00:03:40.320> the

so<00:04:36.850> its<00:04:36.970> price<00:04:37.210> my<00:04:37.450> overall<00:04:37.840> thoughts<00:04:38.290> if<00:04:38.680> I

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 
so its price my overall thoughts if I

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.070 
so its price my overall thoughts if I
didn't<00:04:39.310> have<00:04:39.490> too<00:04:39.820> much<00:04:40.000> expectations<00:04:40.870> for

didn't have too much expectations for
this<00:04:41.230> palette<00:04:41.710> maybe<00:04:42.250> I<00:04:42.550> would<00:04:42.820> have<00:04:42.970> been

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
this palette maybe I would have been

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.710 
this palette maybe I would have been
more<00:04:43.540> impressed<00:04:44.140> or<00:04:44.440> if<00:04:44.710> this<00:04:45.160> wasn't<00:04:45.640> if<00:04:46.510> this

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
more impressed or if this wasn't if this

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.380 
more impressed or if this wasn't if this
was<00:04:46.870> the<00:04:47.140> first<00:04:47.500> kind<00:04:47.920> of<00:04:48.070> nudes<00:04:48.430> palette<00:04:48.730> that

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.390 
was the first kind of nudes palette that

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:50.910 
was the first kind of nudes palette that
was<00:04:49.540> released<00:04:49.900> in<00:04:50.080> the<00:04:50.200> drugstore<00:04:50.500> I'd

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:50.920 
was released in the drugstore I'd

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.210 
was released in the drugstore I'd
probably<00:04:51.220> be<00:04:51.520> a<00:04:51.700> lot<00:04:51.730> more<00:04:52.540> excited<00:04:53.470> once<00:04:54.070> I

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
probably be a lot more excited once I

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.220 
probably be a lot more excited once I
got<00:04:54.400> to<00:04:54.550> play<00:04:54.790> with<00:04:54.940> the<00:04:55.090> eyeshadows<00:04:55.600> I<00:04:55.810> felt

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
got to play with the eyeshadows I felt

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.900 
got to play with the eyeshadows I felt
like<00:04:56.350> I<00:04:56.470> was<00:04:56.590> more<00:04:56.770> excited<00:04:57.310> with<00:04:57.760> the

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
like I was more excited with the

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:59.760 
like I was more excited with the
Maybelline<00:04:58.120> the<00:04:58.390> nudes<00:04:58.630> palette<00:04:58.960> even<00:04:59.650> though

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
Maybelline the nudes palette even though

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.470 
Maybelline the nudes palette even though
this<00:04:59.980> is<00:05:00.130> a<00:05:00.160> lot<00:05:00.400> less<00:05:00.610> pigmented<00:05:01.090> than<00:05:01.270> those

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.480 
this is a lot less pigmented than those

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.450 
this is a lot less pigmented than those
two<00:05:01.660> palettes<00:05:02.170> I<00:05:02.320> felt<00:05:02.710> like<00:05:02.860> for<00:05:03.070> the<00:05:03.130> price

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
two palettes I felt like for the price

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.930 
two palettes I felt like for the price
and<00:05:04.210> kind<00:05:05.140> of<00:05:05.290> the<00:05:05.680> way<00:05:05.830> it<00:05:06.040> was<00:05:06.190> presented<00:05:06.400> I

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
and kind of the way it was presented I

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.120 
and kind of the way it was presented I
wanted<00:05:07.330> the<00:05:07.630> eyeshadows<00:05:08.110> to<00:05:08.140> kind<00:05:08.500> of<00:05:08.590> give<00:05:08.860> me

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
wanted the eyeshadows to kind of give me

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.010 
wanted the eyeshadows to kind of give me
more<00:05:09.490> I<00:05:09.790> wouldn't<00:05:10.060> say<00:05:10.300> this<00:05:10.480> eyeshadow

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
more I wouldn't say this eyeshadow

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.250 
more I wouldn't say this eyeshadow
palettes<00:05:11.470> are<00:05:11.620> completely<00:05:12.580> bad<00:05:12.820> but<00:05:13.390> I<00:05:13.660> was

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260 
palettes are completely bad but I was

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.870 
palettes are completely bad but I was
expecting<00:05:14.860> a<00:05:14.980> little<00:05:15.130> bit<00:05:15.340> more<00:05:15.550> from<00:05:15.730> this

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
expecting a little bit more from this

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.340 
expecting a little bit more from this
eyeshadow<00:05:16.300> palettes<00:05:16.660> granted<00:05:17.050> that<00:05:17.170> I<00:05:17.230> do

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 
eyeshadow palettes granted that I do

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.590 
eyeshadow palettes granted that I do
have<00:05:17.740> a<00:05:17.770> larger<00:05:18.370> collection<00:05:18.580> of<00:05:19.120> high-end

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 
have a larger collection of high-end

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.560 
have a larger collection of high-end
eyeshadow<00:05:20.080> palettes<00:05:20.710> that<00:05:20.950> are<00:05:21.400> similar<00:05:22.210> to

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
eyeshadow palettes that are similar to

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.400 
eyeshadow palettes that are similar to
the<00:05:22.930> naked<00:05:23.500> format<00:05:24.310> so<00:05:24.820> it<00:05:25.330> really<00:05:25.750> it<00:05:25.960> depends

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
the naked format so it really it depends

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.730 
the naked format so it really it depends
on<00:05:26.680> what<00:05:27.310> your<00:05:27.460> budget<00:05:27.640> is<00:05:28.090> and<00:05:28.530> what<00:05:29.530> you're

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
on what your budget is and what you're

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.530 
on what your budget is and what you're
