I<00:03:24.040> bet<00:03:24.190> it's<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.490> interrupter<00:03:29.490> look<00:03:30.490> at<00:03:30.610> the

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
I bet it's the interrupter look at the

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:45.910 
I bet it's the interrupter look at the
gear<00:03:30.880> on<00:03:30.970> how<00:03:31.060> to<00:03:31.120> open<00:03:31.300> it
