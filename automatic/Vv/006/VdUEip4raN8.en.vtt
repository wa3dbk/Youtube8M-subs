00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello youtube friends this time 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.379
 I bring you a criticism and analysis to the 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.800
 drama island but I'll just talk about the 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.900
 first season let's start island 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.330
 drama is a caricature that is about 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.279
 a reality show but that is really 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.830
 a parody of the reality shows of 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.560
 true if not bad memory was premiered by 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.199
 2009 in cartoon network this is 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.390
 about 22 teenagers who thought that 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.310
 they were going to be in a luxury camp 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.920
 but when they arrived they realized 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.770
 that that was a lie now what they had 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.320
 What to do is earn 100 thousand dollars 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.780
 going through various challenges but only one 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.030
 of them he could take them but the 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.670
 22 young people were divided into two teams 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.039
 one was called the screaming moles and the 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.050
 another catfish killers here they 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.120
 I will talk about some characters that 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.879
 they distinguished heather was the girl 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.370
 evil of the series the manipulated the 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.289
 ambitious the odious and many more things 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.809
 almost reached the final was the 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.000
 antepenultimate to leave came out because in 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.129
 a challenge had to be shaved and refused to 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.140
 do it but accidentally hit the 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.659
 chef and the machine fell on him 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.909
 so anyway he fucked Wayne 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.860
 she came second in my 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.140
 opinion I think she was the rival most 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.140
 strong because it was the one that won the most challenges 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.180
 apart it was quiet and it did not fall badly had 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.550
 a great rivalry with heather but 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.210
 he also had his romantic moments with 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.190
 30 pity that he lost the final 30 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.590
 he was the guitar guy too 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.050
 It was nice with everyone they did not fall badly 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.150
 he was also a strong rival but for 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.729
 heather's fault he lost and he was taken out 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.890
 like half of the game he was one of 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.920
 the few who supported wen in the final 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.180
 and then they ended up together like everyone 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.640
 we expected 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.800
 typical chubby owen that is all mother 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.110
 in the first several chapters 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.479
 we thought it was going to be one of the 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.860
 first to leave but who would say that 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.860
 he was the winner of the first season 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.080
 You know, it's the fat man who eats like a goku 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.229
 the one that takes a few pinches of dowries 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.910
 well gedeon 2 and the most innocent to me 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.530
 he really liked that he was the one who won 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.619
 Although it was not my character 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.600
 preferred duncan he was the bad boy the 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.740
 that he always did bullying but also 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.680
 he had his moments 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.600
 and more when it came to korn and he was 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.760
 also a very strong opponent too 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.980
 was about to reach the grand final 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.640
 but no way for today they took it out 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.920
 he was my favorite character xdddd korn 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.110
 and she was the girl who felt like a leader 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.420
 of the team was something bossy and sometimes 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.490
 it was a bit annoying for his team 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.770
 had his moment of love with do not can 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.990
 when they stole food to production 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.630
 of the program and how it got a bit 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.490
 you crazy outside the cabin after kissed 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.950
 Don campero at that time saw them 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.630
 harold so on that night harold did 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.270
 trap so that korn and stay out 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.210
 and Harold just did it to get revenge on 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.310
 don kan finally remain cris he is the 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.710
 host of the program is a character 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.810
 that falls well and the chef is the one 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.240
 kitchen and who participates in all 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.970
 challenges is also nice they do 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.920
 its role very well this program has a 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.800
 very good dubbing because the voices 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.870
 they correspond very well to the characters 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:15.390
 that's something that I liked very much their 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.280
 dialogues is also something good not 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.650
 you can get bored if they entertain you 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.670
 it also has its inconsistencies as 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.040
 all cartoon 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.739
 has but that makes it more fun 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.140
 the bullshit that do another good thing 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.819
 you have are amorous couples me 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.160
 liked that don can and corn and little by little 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.590
 they liked each other even though 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.810
 It seemed that they did not make a partner because 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.420
 kan is a delinquent and korn and is a 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.700
 Decent girl in the drawings are not the 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.520
 better than I have seen but they have good 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.530
 colors in conclusion the series is good 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.290
 but I think it was something exciting to see how 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.780
 the participants left and expect to see 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.030
 the grand finale to see who wins that is 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.610
 a good point because it 's something new 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.250
 see and finally I will give the rating 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.620
 final island of drama has many points 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.620
 in favor because it is very entertaining and 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.230
 comic so I give it an 8 out of 10 if it's 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.180
 very good but I think the 8 is fair 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.910
 because in the times when it came out in 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.739
 cartoon network was a good feeling 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.370
 here ends the video see you later 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.370
 little bitch
