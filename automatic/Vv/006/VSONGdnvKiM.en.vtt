difference is this red filter you're
going<00:01:10.050> to<00:01:10.170> use<00:01:10.380> this<00:01:10.560> in<00:01:10.800> more<00:01:10.980> blue<00:01:11.250> water

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
going to use this in more blue water

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.090 
going to use this in more blue water
like<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.150> dive<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.420> ton<00:01:12.780> in<00:01:12.900> Hawaii<00:01:13.230> this<00:01:13.770> is<00:01:13.830> my

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100

like I dive a ton in Hawaii this is my
go-to<00:01:14.340> filter<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.270> it's<00:01:15.660> really<00:01:15.900> going<00:01:16.020> to

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
go-to filter and it's really going to

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.410 
go-to filter and it's really going to
make<00:01:16.230> those<00:01:16.380> colors<00:01:16.740> pop<00:01:16.790> the<00:01:17.790> magenta<00:01:18.240> filter
