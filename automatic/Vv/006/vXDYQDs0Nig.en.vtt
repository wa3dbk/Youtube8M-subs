it's typing in mixed with my experience

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.990 
it's typing in mixed with my experience
in<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.750> last<00:00:18.960> 13<00:00:19.380> years<00:00:19.650> working<00:00:20.490> in<00:00:20.730> fashion

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
in the last 13 years working in fashion

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.650 
in the last 13 years working in fashion
but<00:00:21.390> I<00:00:21.600> think<00:00:22.670> regarding<00:00:23.670> cult<00:00:23.910> following<00:00:24.449> a

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
but I think regarding cult following a

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.150 
but I think regarding cult following a
lot<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.880> brands<00:00:26.880> have<00:00:27.869> it<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.740> certain

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
lot of brands have it to a certain

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.690 
lot of brands have it to a certain
degree<00:00:29.869> for<00:00:30.869> example<00:00:31.380> I<00:00:31.439> think<00:00:31.470> allergy<00:00:32.340> it's

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
degree for example I think allergy it's

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.569 
degree for example I think allergy it's
undeniable<00:00:33.510> as<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:33.989> postdating<00:00:34.590> lrg<00:00:35.460> is

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
undeniable as this is postdating lrg is

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.150 
undeniable as this is postdating lrg is
still<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.850> very<00:00:36.270> huge<00:00:36.809> very<00:00:37.200> relevant<00:00:37.680> brand

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
still a very huge very relevant brand

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.670 
still a very huge very relevant brand
and<00:00:38.489> they<00:00:39.000> definitely<00:00:39.450> have<00:00:39.750> cult<00:00:40.140> following

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
and they definitely have cult following

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.540 
and they definitely have cult following
but<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.579> don't<00:00:42.300> think<00:00:42.480> they<00:00:42.600> have<00:00:43.100> a<00:00:44.100> cult

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
but I don't think they have a cult

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.760 
but I don't think they have a cult
following<00:00:44.760> stronger<00:00:45.750> than<00:00:46.170> for<00:00:46.739> example

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
following stronger than for example

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.840 
following stronger than for example
johnny<00:00:47.579> cupcakes<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:48.329> think<00:00:49.260> johnny<00:00:49.530> cupcakes

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.959 
fans are um more intrinsically attached
to<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:58.140> brand<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.250> person<00:00:59.699> who<00:00:59.850> is
