you want but for me personally there was

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.050 
you want but for me personally there was
definitely<00:00:17.590> a<00:00:17.680> time<00:00:17.890> when<00:00:18.340> I<00:00:18.580> was<00:00:18.820> very

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.060 
definitely a time when I was very

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.350 
definitely a time when I was very
frustrated<00:00:20.160> with<00:00:21.160> the<00:00:21.369> lack<00:00:21.399> of<00:00:21.759> results<00:00:22.060> as

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:22.360 
frustrated with the lack of results as

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.359 
frustrated with the lack of results as
far<00:00:22.660> as<00:00:22.930> I<00:00:23.259> was<00:00:23.320> trying<00:00:23.560> different<00:00:23.770> programs

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:24.369 
far as I was trying different programs

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:26.729 
far as I was trying different programs
need<00:00:25.210> different<00:00:25.329> exercises<00:00:26.020> and<00:00:26.500> I<00:00:26.529> just

00:00:26.729 --> 00:00:26.739 
need different exercises and I just

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:29.280 
need different exercises and I just
quite<00:00:27.189> couldn't<00:00:27.669> get<00:00:28.300> all<00:00:28.480> the<00:00:28.599> pieces<00:00:28.809> to<00:00:29.079> fit

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:29.290 
quite couldn't get all the pieces to fit

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:30.330 
quite couldn't get all the pieces to fit
and<00:00:29.410> it<00:00:29.470> didn't<00:00:29.710> make<00:00:29.800> sense<00:00:30.099> you<00:00:30.279> know

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.340 
and it didn't make sense you know

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.400 
and it didn't make sense you know
because<00:00:30.669> I<00:00:30.790> was<00:00:30.880> going<00:00:31.090> to<00:00:31.239> the<00:00:31.329> gym<00:00:31.599> I<00:00:31.869> was

all right so this is an overview of the
framework<00:01:05.090> if<00:01:05.600> you<00:01:05.750> want<00:01:06.050> a<00:01:06.230> more<00:01:06.500> in-depth

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
framework if you want a more in-depth

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.540 
framework if you want a more in-depth
study<00:01:07.460> I<00:01:07.550> suggest<00:01:08.180> you<00:01:08.360> sign<00:01:08.750> up<00:01:09.400> for<00:01:10.400> the

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
study I suggest you sign up for the

study I suggest you sign up for the
seven<00:01:10.880> day<00:01:11.000> program<00:01:11.390> below<00:01:11.750> where<00:01:12.470> I<00:01:12.500> will<00:01:12.710> go

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
seven day program below where I will go

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.070 
seven day program below where I will go
over<00:01:13.070> these<00:01:13.460> in<00:01:13.820> detail<00:01:14.240> with<00:01:14.420> you<00:01:14.690> you<00:01:14.990> know

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
over these in detail with you you know

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.780 
over these in detail with you you know
once<00:01:15.380> each<00:01:15.680> day<00:01:15.710> so<00:01:15.980> it's<00:01:16.280> a<00:01:16.370> little<00:01:16.610> more

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
once each day so it's a little more

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.859 
once each day so it's a little more
easier<00:01:17.180> to<00:01:17.950> digest

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.140 

all<00:01:22.869> right<00:01:23.020> so<00:01:23.380> you<00:01:24.130> are<00:01:24.310> ready<00:01:24.580> to<00:01:24.670> get<00:01:25.030> the

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
all right so you are ready to get the

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.969 
all right so you are ready to get the
body<00:01:25.330> that<00:01:25.450> you<00:01:25.720> want<00:01:25.750> what's<00:01:26.320> the<00:01:26.470> first<00:01:26.680> step

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
body that you want what's the first step

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:28.710 
body that you want what's the first step
well<00:01:27.280> you've<00:01:27.670> kind<00:01:27.909> of<00:01:27.970> already<00:01:28.060> started<00:01:28.270> it

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
well you've kind of already started it

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.680 
well you've kind of already started it
and<00:01:28.900> that<00:01:29.500> is<00:01:29.799> the<00:01:30.369> vision<00:01:30.580> right<00:01:31.180> having<00:01:31.600> the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
and that is the vision right having the

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:38.460 
and that is the vision right having the
vision<00:01:36.210> visualizing<00:01:37.210> the<00:01:37.450> body<00:01:37.659> that<00:01:38.080> you

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
vision visualizing the body that you

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.760 
vision visualizing the body that you
want<00:01:38.500> to<00:01:38.770> add<00:01:38.950> or<00:01:39.190> that<00:01:39.310> you<00:01:39.460> want<00:01:39.580> to<00:01:39.729> achieve

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.099 

all<00:01:43.399> right<00:01:43.549> the<00:01:43.700> next<00:01:43.969> step<00:01:44.180> is<00:01:44.509> we<00:01:44.929> need<00:01:44.960> to

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:45.109 
all right the next step is we need to

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:48.490 
all right the next step is we need to
translate<00:01:45.560> that<00:01:45.799> vision<00:01:45.859> into<00:01:46.729> a<00:01:46.759> goal<00:01:47.259> okay<00:01:48.289> a

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
translate that vision into a goal okay a

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.800 
translate that vision into a goal okay a
goal<00:01:48.950> is<00:01:49.159> something<00:01:49.340> that<00:01:49.640> is<00:01:49.759> specific<00:01:50.570> and

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
goal is something that is specific and

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.890 
goal is something that is specific and
measurable

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.830 

so<00:01:55.440> after<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.010> goal<00:01:56.280> after<00:01:56.790> we've<00:01:57.450> determined

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
so after the goal after we've determined

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.720 
so after the goal after we've determined
and<00:01:58.140> set<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.470> goal<00:01:58.650> that<00:01:58.770> we<00:01:58.890> want<00:01:59.010> to<00:01:59.100> achieve

00:01:59.720 --> 00:01:59.730 
and set the goal that we want to achieve

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.270 
and set the goal that we want to achieve
the<00:02:00.180> next<00:02:00.810> step<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.290> determining<00:02:02.130> the

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
the next step is determining the

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.170 
the next step is determining the
strategy

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
strategy

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:14.020 
strategy
okay<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.050> strategy<00:02:04.710> which<00:02:05.010> is<00:02:12.560> strategy<00:02:13.560> and

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
okay the strategy which is strategy and

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.350 
okay the strategy which is strategy and
the<00:02:15.030> strategy<00:02:15.060> is<00:02:15.960> going<00:02:16.560> to<00:02:16.650> be<00:02:16.890> how<00:02:17.220> we

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
the strategy is going to be how we

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.160 
the strategy is going to be how we
accomplish<00:02:18.360> or<00:02:18.930> achieve<00:02:18.990> that<00:02:19.770> goal

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.070 

and<00:02:23.560> after<00:02:23.950> a<00:02:23.980> strategy<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:25.330> next<00:02:25.600> step<00:02:25.780> is

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
and after a strategy the next step is

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.890 
and after a strategy the next step is
the<00:02:26.530> tactics<00:02:27.069> all<00:02:27.580> right<00:02:27.760> and<00:02:28.000> these<00:02:28.180> are<00:02:28.540> this

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
the tactics all right and these are this

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.170 
the tactics all right and these are this
is<00:02:28.959> the<00:02:29.140> doing<00:02:29.650> phase<00:02:30.280> this<00:02:30.610> is<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.910> stuff

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
is the doing phase this is the stuff

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:38.130 
is the doing phase this is the stuff
we're<00:02:31.390> going<00:02:31.540> to<00:02:31.600> do<00:02:36.450> right<00:02:37.450> this<00:02:37.690> is<00:02:37.900> like

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
we're going to do right this is like

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.380 
we're going to do right this is like
your<00:02:38.350> workout<00:02:38.770> program<00:02:38.980> your<00:02:39.790> diet<00:02:40.030> program

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
all right so after we have the tactics

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.360 
all right so after we have the tactics
the<00:02:47.180> next<00:02:47.569> the<00:02:47.959> bottom<00:02:48.319> of<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:48.500> rung<00:02:48.650> are<00:02:49.040> the
