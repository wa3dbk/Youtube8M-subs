and this goes in that tripod mount of
the<00:03:41.840> camera<00:03:42.260> basically<00:03:42.769> and<00:03:43.069> that<00:03:43.480> way<00:03:44.480> it

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
the camera basically and that way it

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.539

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
you have a larger hand then you finally

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.220 
you have a larger hand then you finally

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
then when you take pictures in portrait

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:10.720 
then when you take pictures in portrait
mode<00:04:08.379> then<00:04:09.379> you<00:04:09.410> have<00:04:09.919> your<00:04:10.280> shutter<00:04:10.579> button

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
you're used to have so you don't have to

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:23.230 
you're used to have so you don't have to
do<00:04:17.269> any<00:04:17.570> acrobatics<00:04:18.849> and<00:04:20.500> then<00:04:21.500> on<00:04:22.310> this<00:04:22.940> side

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
do any acrobatics and then on this side

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.050 
do any acrobatics and then on this side
here<00:04:24.250> you<00:04:25.250> fold

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
here you fold

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.040 
here you fold
stone<00:04:26.389> then<00:04:27.200> you<00:04:27.350> turn<00:04:27.650> it<00:04:27.680> to<00:04:28.010> unlock<00:04:28.160> and

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
stone then you turn it to unlock and

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.760 
stone then you turn it to unlock and
this<00:04:30.050> removes<00:04:30.530> the<00:04:30.680> battery<00:04:31.220> tray<00:04:31.460> and<00:04:32.770> this

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
this removes the battery tray and this

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.740 
this removes the battery tray and this
is<00:04:33.950> where<00:04:34.130> you<00:04:34.370> would<00:04:34.520> put<00:04:34.580> the<00:04:34.970> other<00:04:35.180> battery

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
is where you would put the other battery

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.310 
is where you would put the other battery
tray<00:04:36.020> if<00:04:36.230> you<00:04:36.260> have<00:04:36.650> double-a<00:04:37.160> batteries<00:04:38.320> but

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.200 

alright<00:05:03.380> so<00:05:03.740> I<00:05:03.830> put<00:05:04.100> the<00:05:04.280> battery<00:05:04.729> like<00:05:04.940> this

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210

alright so I put the battery like this
and<00:05:07.780> now<00:05:08.780> it<00:05:08.990> goes<00:05:09.260> in<00:05:09.620> turn<00:05:10.520> this<00:05:10.700> on<00:05:11.000> and<00:05:13.389> I

and now it goes in turn this on and I
put<00:05:14.870> the<00:05:15.260> camera<00:05:15.950> on<00:05:16.100> and<00:05:16.430> everything<00:05:17.300> seems

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
put the camera on and everything seems

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:23.620 
put the camera on and everything seems
to<00:05:17.660> be<00:05:17.750> working<00:05:17.870> correctly<00:05:18.590> and<00:05:19.810> if<00:05:20.810> I<00:05:22.479> turn<00:05:23.479> it

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
to be working correctly and if I turn it

aperture and all the other settings as

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.860 
aperture and all the other settings as
usual<00:06:14.440> so<00:06:15.850> experiment<00:06:16.850> a<00:06:17.030> bit<00:06:17.060> with<00:06:17.360> it<00:06:17.510> and

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:17.870 
usual so experiment a bit with it and

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:22.270 
usual so experiment a bit with it and
I'll<00:06:18.910> try<00:06:19.910> out<00:06:20.120> the<00:06:20.479> other<00:06:21.139> functions<00:06:21.800> such<00:06:22.070> as

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:22.280 
I'll try out the other functions such as

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.540 
I'll try out the other functions such as
the<00:06:22.490> intervalometer<00:06:23.180> and<00:06:23.690> all<00:06:23.810> that<00:06:24.190> and<00:06:25.190> once

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:25.550 
the intervalometer and all that and once

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.430 
the intervalometer and all that and once
I<00:06:25.729> figure<00:06:26.060> out<00:06:26.090> how<00:06:26.450> it<00:06:26.600> works<00:06:26.870> I'll<00:06:27.229> do

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:27.440 
I figure out how it works I'll do

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.340 
I figure out how it works I'll do
another<00:06:27.650> video<00:06:28.240> so<00:06:29.240> thank<00:06:29.660> you<00:06:29.750> for<00:06:29.900> watching
