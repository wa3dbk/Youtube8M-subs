00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700
 the karlsruher sc presents wildpark 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.569
 deep 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.569
 powered by bathing tv 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:16.740
 I have in mind what doubts arise 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:18.609
 We want to win against Duisburg before 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.949
 that somehow goes down 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:22.829
 We believe I have against Frankfurt 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:26.529
 good performance 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:28.300
 and above all, this applies 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:29.680
 Aggressiveness This compactness of these 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.730
 team-like closeness as well 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.770
 to lay on the day 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.770
 We have done all networks 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.390
 Duisburg is a compact team 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.219
 a physically very strong team 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.859
 with a lot of big players too 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:48.699
 especially in the storm they have some 

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:51.199
 Alternatives a good alternative 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:55.089
 I believe the results or that was 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.089
 that was not so much ago 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.859
 But Duisburg has quality and has too 

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:03.050
 if you do not have that many points on it 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:05.059
 the account has a lot to offer 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.089
 also on the fight and over everything has us 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.089
 demanded 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.100
 not not necessarily 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.700
 He also trained properly 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.350
 Of course the criticism has of course 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.710
 plug in must also be justified 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.930
 were a stoop that had 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.060
 has adopted very concentrated 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.280
 training week so that 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.750
 Of course that's an option , too 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.450
 the others always play with it 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.979
 of course, expensive brands have always stoll 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.220
 also the possibility of good performance 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.460
 to play in the foreground 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:43.170
 has, as I said I have a good good 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.560
 week so that also a lot 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.560
 speaks for it 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.340
 but do it 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.080
 showed yes you can see the one or 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.670
 Another situation, yes that was 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.130
 that even more is possible 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.980
 situation from the gate where he hesitates but that 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.270
 is the way of development 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.460
 now that has just said then again 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.990
 back how to make all the tores what the one 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.179
 own half has sometimes organized 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.100
 or many maxi first play this 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.200
 that's normal that's exactly this 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.340
 development process that is part of that 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.780
 you sometimes make mistakes that one 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.330
 this is better said next time 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:22.530
 doing that is exactly this process though 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.630
 his base that he has shown his 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.240
 also play his movement were 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.480
 great and that's good and that's why 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:33.360
 he also start again from the beginning
