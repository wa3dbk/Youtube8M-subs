this<00:03:53.019> car<00:03:53.220> for<00:03:54.220> instance<00:03:54.549> we<00:03:54.730> had<00:03:54.880> to<00:03:55.060> make<00:03:55.209> the

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
this car for instance we had to make the

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.900 
this car for instance we had to make the
head<00:03:55.540> lamps<00:03:55.959> and<00:03:56.140> to<00:03:56.980> do<00:03:57.130> that<00:03:57.280> we<00:03:57.459> had<00:03:57.610> to<00:03:57.640> make

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
head lamps and to do that we had to make

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.000 
head lamps and to do that we had to make
forms<00:03:58.510> out<00:03:58.870> of<00:03:59.049> wood<00:03:59.290> for<00:03:59.590> each<00:03:59.709> of<00:03:59.920> these

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.190 
forms out of wood for each of these
shapes<00:04:00.430> and<00:04:00.880> then<00:04:00.970> have<00:04:01.209> these<00:04:01.420> parts<00:04:01.840> spun

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
shapes and then have these parts spun

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.500 
shapes and then have these parts spun
and<00:04:02.500> some<00:04:03.220> of<00:04:03.340> them<00:04:03.459> are<00:04:03.610> cast<00:04:03.880> and<00:04:04.330> then<00:04:04.390> they

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
and some of them are cast and then they

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.960 
and some of them are cast and then they
all<00:04:04.630> had<00:04:04.660> to<00:04:04.870> be<00:04:04.989> machined<00:04:05.380> and<00:04:05.590> put<00:04:05.739> together

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
all had to be machined and put together

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.120 
all had to be machined and put together
for<00:04:06.970> the<00:04:07.060> fender<00:04:07.480> we<00:04:08.080> had<00:04:08.260> to<00:04:08.410> make<00:04:08.560> a<00:04:08.739> wooden

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
for the fender we had to make a wooden

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.120 
for the fender we had to make a wooden
form<00:04:09.760> of<00:04:10.060> this<00:04:10.660> shape<00:04:10.959> and<00:04:11.230> take<00:04:11.829> it<00:04:11.980> to<00:04:12.100> a

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
form of this shape and take it to a

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.130 
form of this shape and take it to a
company<00:04:12.640> that<00:04:12.850> makes<00:04:13.090> the<00:04:13.329> metal<00:04:13.630> to<00:04:13.780> fit<00:04:13.989> the

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
that this car was a farm wagon the brass

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.520 
that this car was a farm wagon the brass
the<00:04:33.070> original<00:04:33.880> pieces<00:04:34.090> had<00:04:34.419> been<00:04:34.600> taken<00:04:35.020> and

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
the original pieces had been taken and

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.580 
the original pieces had been taken and
used<00:04:35.949> for<00:04:36.639> scrap<00:04:37.360> drives<00:04:37.750> during<00:04:38.260> World<00:04:38.470> War

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
used for scrap drives during World War

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.210 
used for scrap drives during World War
two<00:04:38.919> so<00:04:39.160> we<00:04:39.910> had<00:04:40.090> to<00:04:40.270> remake<00:04:40.660> this<00:04:41.530> tube<00:04:41.919> and

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
two so we had to remake this tube and

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.960 
two so we had to remake this tube and
this<00:04:42.820> tube<00:04:43.110> these<00:04:44.110> clamps<00:04:44.590> in<00:04:45.040> each<00:04:45.610> of<00:04:45.790> these

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
this tube these clamps in each of these

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.110 
this tube these clamps in each of these
plugs<00:04:46.560> so<00:04:47.560> most<00:04:47.770> of<00:04:47.919> the<00:04:48.040> brass<00:04:48.250> we<00:04:48.580> made<00:04:48.820> from

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
plugs so most of the brass we made from

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.890 
plugs so most of the brass we made from
scratch<00:04:50.520> you'll<00:04:51.520> notice<00:04:51.910> that<00:04:52.120> the<00:04:52.270> hoses<00:04:52.720> are

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
scratch you'll notice that the hoses are

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:58.230 
scratch you'll notice that the hoses are
red<00:04:53.139> in<00:04:53.880> 1914<00:04:54.880> rubber<00:04:55.660> was<00:04:56.620> dyed<00:04:56.949> red<00:04:57.370> instead

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
red in 1914 rubber was dyed red instead

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.070 
red in 1914 rubber was dyed red instead
of<00:04:58.300> black<00:04:58.660> as<00:04:59.050> you<00:04:59.199> see<00:04:59.380> it<00:04:59.470> today<00:05:00.630> we<00:05:01.630> also<00:05:01.750> had

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
of black as you see it today we also had

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.439 
of black as you see it today we also had
to<00:05:02.260> make<00:05:02.289> the<00:05:02.590> firewall<00:05:03.100> that's<00:05:03.699> this<00:05:03.970> panel

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:04.449 
to make the firewall that's this panel

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:07.320 
to make the firewall that's this panel
it<00:05:05.110> keeps<00:05:05.440> the<00:05:05.620> heat<00:05:05.770> of<00:05:05.979> the<00:05:06.070> engine<00:05:06.330> inside

look here you can see the spring for the
valve<00:06:17.139> is<00:06:17.440> all<00:06:17.860> exposed<00:06:18.340> if<00:06:19.030> we<00:06:19.599> wanted<00:06:19.870> to<00:06:19.990> do

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110 
valve is all exposed if we wanted to do

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.650 
valve is all exposed if we wanted to do
a<00:06:20.139> valve<00:06:20.530> job<00:06:20.650> on<00:06:21.099> this<00:06:21.250> car<00:06:21.550> it<00:06:22.360> would<00:06:22.479> be

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:22.660 
a valve job on this car it would be

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.719 
a valve job on this car it would be
simply<00:06:23.080> a<00:06:23.110> matter<00:06:23.349> of<00:06:23.470> unscrewing<00:06:24.099> these<00:06:24.400> and

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:24.729 
simply a matter of unscrewing these and

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:26.520 
simply a matter of unscrewing these and
lifting<00:06:25.330> the<00:06:25.449> valves<00:06:25.810> out<00:06:25.960> and<00:06:26.229> it<00:06:26.320> takes

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:26.530 
lifting the valves out and it takes

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.129 
lifting the valves out and it takes
about<00:06:26.680> a<00:06:26.830> minute<00:06:27.099> to<00:06:27.880> take<00:06:28.060> each<00:06:28.270> valve<00:06:28.599> out<00:06:28.870> so

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:29.139 
about a minute to take each valve out so

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:32.550 
about a minute to take each valve out so
it's<00:06:29.260> a<00:06:29.349> very<00:06:29.560> simple<00:06:29.860> process<00:06:30.220> a<00:06:31.440> pair<00:06:32.440> are

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 
it's a very simple process a pair are

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.670 
it's a very simple process a pair are
the<00:06:32.680> ignition<00:06:33.099> wires<00:06:33.360> for<00:06:34.360> the<00:06:35.140> secondary
