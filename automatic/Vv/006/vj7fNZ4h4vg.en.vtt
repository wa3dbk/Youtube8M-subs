even<00:00:45.719> making<00:00:46.079> let's<00:00:46.440> play<00:00:46.649> so<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:47.100> all<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.610> know

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
even making let's play so I all I know

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.400 
even making let's play so I all I know
is<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.180> this<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:48.690> like<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:48.960> pretty<00:00:49.289> little

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
is that this is like a pretty little

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.990 
is that this is like a pretty little
short<00:00:49.800> map<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:51.149> has<00:00:51.510> Buddha<00:00:52.379> in<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.640> I

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
short map and it has Buddha in it so I

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.700 
short map and it has Buddha in it so I
decided<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.510> play<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:54.930> it's<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.230> sprint<00:00:55.500> map

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
decided to play it and it's a sprint map

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.770 
decided to play it and it's a sprint map
as<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.160> can<00:00:56.430> see<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.699> this<00:00:57.059> means<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.390> we

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
as you can see and this means that we

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.979 
as you can see and this means that we
need<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:57.960> put<00:00:58.199> our<00:00:58.350> field<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.770> view<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.430> 90<00:01:00.000> so

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
need to put our field of view to 90 so

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.189 
need to put our field of view to 90 so
we're<00:01:01.140> like<00:01:01.350> more<00:01:01.649> emoji<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.280> let's<00:01:02.609> do<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:03.199> so

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
we're like more emoji and let's do it so

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.370 
we're like more emoji and let's do it so
it<00:01:05.040> looks<00:01:05.280> like<00:01:05.360> come<00:01:06.360> on<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.659> flag<00:01:06.840> on<00:01:06.990> me<00:01:07.110> it

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
it looks like come on the flag on me it

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.560 
it looks like come on the flag on me it
looks<00:01:07.590> like<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.770> pretty<00:01:08.040> fun<00:01:08.220> little<00:01:08.490> map<00:01:08.729> and

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
looks like a pretty fun little map and

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.500 
looks like a pretty fun little map and
I'm<00:01:10.409> using<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.280> shaders<00:01:11.610> mod<00:01:11.640> once<00:01:12.180> again

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
I'm using the shaders mod once again

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.960 
I'm using the shaders mod once again
because<00:01:12.930> it's<00:01:13.229> just<00:01:13.619> pretty<00:01:13.950> even<00:01:14.790> though<00:01:14.880> it

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
because it's just pretty even though it

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.260 
because it's just pretty even though it
makes<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.390> bit<00:01:15.479> harder<00:01:16.130> and<00:01:19.820> it's<00:01:20.820> like<00:01:21.060> a

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
makes it a bit harder and it's like a

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.039 
makes it a bit harder and it's like a
really<00:01:21.600> nice<00:01:22.229> sprint<00:01:22.890> map<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.369> far<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.610> like<00:01:23.850> it

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
really nice sprint map so far I like it

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.910 
really nice sprint map so far I like it
and<00:01:25.100> this<00:01:26.100> time<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.450> might<00:01:27.740> you<00:01:28.740> might

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
and this time you you might you might

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.499 
and this time you you might you might
have<00:01:29.130> noticed<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.549> my<00:01:29.790> graphics<00:01:30.180> are<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.329> bit

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
have noticed that my graphics are a bit

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.960 
have noticed that my graphics are a bit
different<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.380> this<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.100> because<00:01:32.400> I'm<00:01:32.670> using

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
different and this is because I'm using

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.649 
different and this is because I'm using
the<00:01:33.930> texture<00:01:34.500> pack<00:01:34.710> which<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.369> faithful<00:01:35.970> 32x

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
the texture pack which is faithful 32x

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.170 
the texture pack which is faithful 32x
the<00:01:37.229> same<00:01:37.500> one<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.740> deadlocks<00:01:38.280> uses<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.820> it

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
the same one that deadlocks uses and it

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.620 
the same one that deadlocks uses and it
just<00:01:39.479> looks<00:01:39.659> looks<00:01:40.259> awesome<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:40.829> it's<00:01:41.159> like

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
just looks looks awesome and it's like

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.990 
just looks looks awesome and it's like
32x<00:01:42.630> which<00:01:43.590> makes<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:44.009> 32<00:01:44.460> times<00:01:44.640> more<00:01:44.820> awesome

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
32x which makes it 32 times more awesome

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.200 
32x which makes it 32 times more awesome
and<00:01:46.310> you<00:01:47.310> had<00:01:47.399> this<00:01:47.520> map<00:01:47.729> would've<00:01:48.030> been

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
and you had this map would've been

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.649 
and you had this map would've been
better<00:01:48.450> if<00:01:48.689> we<00:01:48.840> had<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.229> speed<00:01:49.560> potion<00:01:49.740> on<00:01:50.100> but

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
better if we had the speed potion on but

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.980
