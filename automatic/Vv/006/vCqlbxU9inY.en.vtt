00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:16.350
 these are the hinges of the moon 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.170
 classic ones that are the 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:24.359
 medicines or even in closets in 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:28.769
 any way you need to have one 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:31.189
 tip with a 35 mm diameter like 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.189
 this deal 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:39.800
 then a column drill is needed 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.800
 now I'll show you 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:52.570
 ok then there were some good screws for 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:55.000

00:00:52.570 --> 00:01:01.270
 a pencil is a square with the 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.900
 pencil that still goes to the beginning is 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:08.210
 this 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:13.180
 when you make fire at dawn from the hole a 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.180
 edge of the swath must remain 5 mm 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.480
 signal in 5 mm 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.770

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:33.550
 the height you decide it is not 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:37.120

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:58.920

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:01.640

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.640
