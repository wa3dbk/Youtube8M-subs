00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.230 
get these most art supply stores carry

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.200 
get these most art supply stores carry
them<00:00:17.500> because<00:00:17.770> so<00:00:17.980> many<00:00:18.099> artists<00:00:18.580> use<00:00:18.790> them<00:00:19.000> as

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.210 
them because so many artists use them as

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.319 
them because so many artists use them as
paint<00:00:19.599> trees<00:00:19.840> so<00:00:20.500> um<00:00:20.950> or<00:00:21.430> paint<00:00:21.759> palettes<00:00:22.210> I

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:22.329 
paint trees so um or paint palettes I

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:25.229 
paint trees so um or paint palettes I
should<00:00:22.509> say<00:00:22.829> so<00:00:23.829> how<00:00:24.160> do<00:00:24.220> you<00:00:24.369> save<00:00:24.700> your<00:00:24.939> paint

00:00:25.229 --> 00:00:25.239 
should say so how do you save your paint

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:27.929 
should say so how do you save your paint
um<00:00:25.680> this<00:00:26.680> one<00:00:26.860> happens<00:00:27.220> to<00:00:27.309> be<00:00:27.399> empty<00:00:27.730> so<00:00:27.880> I'll

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:27.939 
um this one happens to be empty so I'll

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:29.190 
um this one happens to be empty so I'll
show<00:00:28.149> you<00:00:28.210> both

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:29.200 
show you both

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.319 
show you both
this<00:00:29.590> one<00:00:29.800> has<00:00:29.980> some<00:00:30.160> paint<00:00:30.430> in<00:00:30.520> it<00:00:30.700> but<00:00:31.300> I

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:31.329 
this one has some paint in it but I

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:33.959 
this one has some paint in it but I
wanted<00:00:31.660> to<00:00:31.720> show<00:00:31.930> you<00:00:31.989> how<00:00:32.230> this<00:00:32.550> feels<00:00:33.550> the

00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:33.969 
wanted to show you how this feels the

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:35.760 
wanted to show you how this feels the
palette<00:00:34.300> really<00:00:34.540> well<00:00:34.660> so<00:00:35.050> I<00:00:35.080> used<00:00:35.500> to<00:00:35.650> buy

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
palette really well so I used to buy

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.850 
palette really well so I used to buy
saran<00:00:36.250> wrap<00:00:36.490> or<00:00:36.670> plastic<00:00:37.170> um<00:00:38.170> the<00:00:38.590> thing<00:00:38.830> is

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
saran wrap or plastic um the thing is

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.560 
saran wrap or plastic um the thing is
just<00:00:39.130> that<00:00:39.340> it<00:00:39.430> wouldn't<00:00:39.790> make<00:00:39.970> an<00:00:40.120> airtight

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
just that it wouldn't make an airtight

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.840 
just that it wouldn't make an airtight
seal<00:00:40.840> so<00:00:41.200> I<00:00:41.230> would<00:00:41.590> often<00:00:41.980> lose<00:00:42.220> paint<00:00:42.550> because

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
seal so I would often lose paint because

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.540 
seal so I would often lose paint because
if<00:00:43.200> oxygen<00:00:44.200> gets<00:00:44.440> in<00:00:44.590> there<00:00:44.830> the<00:00:45.340> water

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
if oxygen gets in there the water

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.250 
if oxygen gets in there the water
evaporates<00:00:46.150> of<00:00:46.360> the<00:00:46.420> paint<00:00:46.660> you<00:00:46.840> have<00:00:47.050> dry

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
evaporates of the paint you have dry

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.810 
evaporates of the paint you have dry
paint<00:00:47.530> which<00:00:47.740> is<00:00:47.770> why<00:00:48.010> some<00:00:48.310> people<00:00:48.340> like<00:00:48.700> to

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
paint which is why some people like to

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.069 
paint which is why some people like to
put<00:00:48.910> their<00:00:49.060> paints<00:00:49.360> in<00:00:49.450> the<00:00:49.540> refrigerator

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
put their paints in the refrigerator

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.350 
put their paints in the refrigerator
it's<00:00:50.350> not<00:00:50.800> the<00:00:50.950> coolness<00:00:51.579> of<00:00:51.730> the<00:00:51.880> temperature

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
it's not the coolness of the temperature

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.060 
it's not the coolness of the temperature
but<00:00:52.810> the<00:00:52.930> coolness<00:00:53.170> of<00:00:53.470> the<00:00:53.620> temperature

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
but the coolness of the temperature

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.930 
but the coolness of the temperature
slows<00:00:54.790> evaporation<00:00:55.720> so<00:00:56.410> if<00:00:56.770> you<00:00:57.310> can<00:00:57.520> stop<00:00:57.760> the

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
slows evaporation so if you can stop the

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.340 
slows evaporation so if you can stop the
evaporation<00:00:58.329> you<00:00:58.600> don't<00:00:58.810> need<00:00:58.960> to<00:00:59.050> put<00:00:59.200> this

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
evaporation you don't need to put this

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.400 
evaporation you don't need to put this
paint<00:00:59.620> in<00:00:59.770> the<00:00:59.890> refrigerator<00:01:00.690> anyways<00:01:01.690> so<00:01:02.110> I'm

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
paint in the refrigerator anyways so I'm

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.109 
paint in the refrigerator anyways so I'm
going<00:01:02.710> to<00:01:02.770> tear<00:01:03.040> off<00:01:03.190> the<00:01:03.370> sheet<00:01:03.670> here<00:01:03.970> and

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
going to tear off the sheet here and

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:06.060 
going to tear off the sheet here and
show<00:01:04.299> you<00:01:04.360> how<00:01:04.659> this<00:01:04.930> wrap<00:01:05.259> is<00:01:05.530> different

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
show you how this wrap is different

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.469 
show you how this wrap is different
other<00:01:06.430> wraps<00:01:06.700> if<00:01:06.909> you<00:01:07.000> haven't<00:01:07.180> seen<00:01:07.330> it<00:01:07.450> it's

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
other wraps if you haven't seen it it's

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.840 
other wraps if you haven't seen it it's
basically<00:01:08.220> just<00:01:09.220> something<00:01:09.460> you<00:01:09.550> can<00:01:09.670> get<00:01:09.790> at

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
basically just something you can get at

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.370 
basically just something you can get at
the<00:01:09.970> grocery<00:01:10.090> store<00:01:10.659> it's<00:01:10.780> called<00:01:10.810> GLAAD

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
the grocery store it's called GLAAD

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.480 
the grocery store it's called GLAAD
press<00:01:12.130> and<00:01:12.460> seal<00:01:12.790> and<00:01:14.010> I'm<00:01:15.010> going<00:01:15.190> to<00:01:15.220> stretch

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
press and seal and I'm going to stretch

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:16.830 
press and seal and I'm going to stretch
it<00:01:15.760> across<00:01:15.850> here<00:01:16.270> now<00:01:16.390> what's<00:01:16.630> really

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
it across here now what's really

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.730 
it across here now what's really
important<00:01:17.620> is<00:01:17.950> that<00:01:18.490> um<00:01:19.150> the<00:01:19.810> edges<00:01:20.440> of

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
important is that um the edges of

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.190 
important is that um the edges of
anything<00:01:21.670> that<00:01:21.850> you're<00:01:22.030> attaching<00:01:22.690> it<00:01:22.930> to<00:01:23.049> be

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
anything that you're attaching it to be

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.620 
anything that you're attaching it to be
clean<00:01:23.620> and<00:01:23.920> dry<00:01:24.159> so<00:01:24.490> if<00:01:24.670> you<00:01:24.820> had<00:01:25.000> slapped<00:01:25.299> some

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
clean and dry so if you had slapped some

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.960 
clean and dry so if you had slapped some
paint<00:01:25.900> around<00:01:26.229> you<00:01:26.950> would<00:01:27.130> want<00:01:27.340> to<00:01:27.460> go<00:01:27.610> and

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
paint around you would want to go and

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.780 
paint around you would want to go and
take<00:01:28.180> a<00:01:28.240> rag<00:01:28.630> and<00:01:28.659> just<00:01:29.530> wipe<00:01:30.280> around<00:01:30.490> the

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
take a rag and just wipe around the

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.210 
take a rag and just wipe around the
edges<00:01:31.210> before<00:01:31.570> you<00:01:31.900> try<00:01:32.080> to<00:01:32.110> put<00:01:32.380> this<00:01:32.500> press

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
edges before you try to put this press

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.870 
edges before you try to put this press
and<00:01:33.250> seal<00:01:33.580> on<00:01:33.760> but<00:01:34.420> um<00:01:34.740> I'm<00:01:35.740> gonna<00:01:35.979> press<00:01:36.490> it<00:01:36.520> on

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
and seal on but um I'm gonna press it on

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.609 
and seal on but um I'm gonna press it on
this<00:01:37.150> edge<00:01:37.510> and<00:01:38.080> then<00:01:38.680> pull<00:01:39.100> it<00:01:39.280> taut<00:01:40.619> across

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
this edge and then pull it taut across

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.859 
this edge and then pull it taut across
to<00:01:42.310> this<00:01:42.729> edge<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:44.700> press<00:01:45.700> that<00:01:45.909> there<00:01:46.210> so

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
to this edge and press that there so

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.620 
to this edge and press that there so
what's<00:01:47.320> cool<00:01:47.619> about<00:01:47.650> this<00:01:48.220> is<00:01:48.640> there's<00:01:49.000> it

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
what's cool about this is there's it

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.390 
what's cool about this is there's it
works<00:01:49.960> with<00:01:50.229> some<00:01:50.439> kind<00:01:50.619> of<00:01:50.680> pressure<00:01:50.950> and<00:01:51.250> I'm

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
works with some kind of pressure and I'm

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.760 
works with some kind of pressure and I'm
not<00:01:51.520> really<00:01:51.670> sure<00:01:52.000> it<00:01:52.900> almost<00:01:53.200> feels<00:01:53.470> like<00:01:53.560> it

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
not really sure it almost feels like it

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.490 
not really sure it almost feels like it
gets<00:01:53.920> a<00:01:54.010> glued<00:01:54.310> on<00:01:54.490> there<00:01:54.700> but<00:01:54.850> another<00:01:55.060> snail

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
gets a glued on there but another snail

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.740 
gets a glued on there but another snail
adhesive<00:01:56.500> on<00:01:57.189> this<00:01:57.340> wrap<00:01:57.670> just<00:01:58.299> maybe<00:01:58.540> it's

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
adhesive on this wrap just maybe it's

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.420 
adhesive on this wrap just maybe it's
some<00:01:58.900> kind<00:01:59.140> of<00:01:59.200> like<00:01:59.380> a<00:01:59.409> mild<00:01:59.680> adhesive<00:02:00.130> anyway

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
some kind of like a mild adhesive anyway

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.929 
some kind of like a mild adhesive anyway
so<00:02:01.090> I'm<00:02:01.299> pressing<00:02:01.830> all<00:02:02.830> around<00:02:03.640> really

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
so I'm pressing all around really

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:07.620 
so I'm pressing all around really
carefully<00:02:04.630> making<00:02:04.840> sure<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:06.189> no<00:02:06.610> air<00:02:07.090> can

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
carefully making sure that no air can

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.339 
carefully making sure that no air can
get<00:02:07.780> out<00:02:07.960> it's<00:02:08.200> actually<00:02:08.379> air<00:02:08.799> tight<00:02:09.220> okay<00:02:09.819> and

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
get out it's actually air tight okay and

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.190 
get out it's actually air tight okay and
see<00:02:11.349> if<00:02:11.499> they<00:02:11.680> were<00:02:11.739> pain<00:02:12.040> in<00:02:12.189> there<00:02:12.370> what<00:02:12.549> is

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
see if they were pain in there what is

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.540 
see if they were pain in there what is
well<00:02:13.440> what's<00:02:13.620> cool<00:02:13.860> about<00:02:13.920> this<00:02:14.190> is<00:02:14.250> it's

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
well what's cool about this is it's

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.640 
well what's cool about this is it's
pulled<00:02:14.820> taut<00:02:15.180> so<00:02:15.660> have<00:02:15.870> you<00:02:15.960> ever<00:02:16.020> wrapped<00:02:16.440> up

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
pulled taut so have you ever wrapped up

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.520 
pulled taut so have you ever wrapped up
a<00:02:16.770> pallet<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.430> what<00:02:18.060> happens<00:02:18.480> is<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:19.050> plastic

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
a pallet and what happens is the plastic

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.310 
a pallet and what happens is the plastic
wrap<00:02:20.060> sinks<00:02:21.060> into<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.540> paint<00:02:21.870> then<00:02:22.050> you<00:02:22.140> peel

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
wrap sinks into the paint then you peel

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.480 
wrap sinks into the paint then you peel
off<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.530> plasma<00:02:22.830> you've<00:02:23.070> got<00:02:23.220> half<00:02:23.460> your

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
off the plasma you've got half your

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.940 
off the plasma you've got half your
paint<00:02:23.970> is<00:02:24.120> on<00:02:24.240> the<00:02:24.360> plastic<00:02:24.840> wrap<00:02:25.020> even<00:02:25.650> trying

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
paint is on the plastic wrap even trying

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.890 
paint is on the plastic wrap even trying
to<00:02:26.100> use<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.340> ziplock<00:02:26.850> bag<00:02:27.120> which<00:02:27.420> would<00:02:27.570> be<00:02:27.690> nice

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
to use a ziplock bag which would be nice

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.840 
to use a ziplock bag which would be nice
because<00:02:28.170> you<00:02:28.320> could<00:02:28.470> reuse<00:02:28.800> it<00:02:29.010> it'll<00:02:29.520> sag

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
because you could reuse it it'll sag

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.690 
because you could reuse it it'll sag
into<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.390> paint<00:02:30.660> and<00:02:30.900> you<00:02:30.959> um<00:02:31.410> you've<00:02:31.770> lost<00:02:32.310> so

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
into the paint and you um you've lost so

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.220 
into the paint and you um you've lost so
much<00:02:32.760> paint<00:02:33.150> when<00:02:33.330> you<00:02:33.420> take<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:33.690> plastic<00:02:34.080> off

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
much paint when you take the plastic off

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.780 
much paint when you take the plastic off
the<00:02:34.709> good<00:02:34.860> thing<00:02:35.010> about<00:02:35.100> this<00:02:35.340> is<00:02:35.520> you<00:02:35.610> can

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
the good thing about this is you can

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.740 
the good thing about this is you can
actually<00:02:35.940> reuse<00:02:36.390> this<00:02:36.990> and<00:02:38.300> reuse<00:02:39.300> it<00:02:39.510> for<00:02:39.540> the

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
actually reuse this and reuse it for the

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.240 
actually reuse this and reuse it for the
next<00:02:39.990> time<00:02:40.140> you<00:02:40.200> paint<00:02:40.530> so<00:02:40.709> when<00:02:40.860> you<00:02:41.010> peel<00:02:41.220> it

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
next time you paint so when you peel it

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.820 
next time you paint so when you peel it
off<00:02:41.490> your<00:02:42.480> paints<00:02:42.780> will<00:02:42.900> be<00:02:42.990> nice<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:43.200> dry

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
off your paints will be nice and dry

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.460 
off your paints will be nice and dry
I<00:02:43.860> would<00:02:44.310> also<00:02:44.520> mist<00:02:45.120> them<00:02:45.450> with<00:02:45.720> water<00:02:46.020> or

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
I would also mist them with water or

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.530 
I would also mist them with water or
some<00:02:46.920> kind<00:02:47.130> of<00:02:47.190> a<00:02:47.280> pallet<00:02:47.700> wetting<00:02:48.000> spray<00:02:48.300> you

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
some kind of a pallet wetting spray you

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.479 
some kind of a pallet wetting spray you
could<00:02:48.690> mist<00:02:48.930> your<00:02:49.110> colors<00:02:49.410> with<00:02:49.590> water<00:02:49.830> and<00:02:50.310> of

could mist your colors with water and of
course<00:02:50.700> you<00:02:50.820> can<00:02:51.000> cut<00:02:51.209> it<00:02:51.360> to<00:02:51.390> smaller<00:02:51.840> sizes

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
course you can cut it to smaller sizes

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.010 
course you can cut it to smaller sizes
for<00:02:52.680> little<00:02:53.010> dishes<00:02:53.400> you<00:02:54.270> know<00:02:54.390> depending<00:02:54.840> I

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
for little dishes you know depending I

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.650 
for little dishes you know depending I
actually<00:02:55.230> work<00:02:56.100> with<00:02:56.340> really<00:02:56.550> fluid<00:02:57.180> acrylic

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
actually work with really fluid acrylic

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.949 
actually work with really fluid acrylic
and<00:02:58.190> um<00:02:59.190> I<00:02:59.310> often<00:02:59.940> have<00:03:00.120> lots<00:03:00.330> of<00:03:00.510> little<00:03:00.690> bowls

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
and um I often have lots of little bowls

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.530 
and um I often have lots of little bowls
of<00:03:01.440> mixdown<00:03:02.070> washes<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:02.910> stuff<00:03:03.150> like<00:03:03.300> that

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
of mixdown washes and stuff like that

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.940 
of mixdown washes and stuff like that
and<00:03:03.780> so<00:03:03.930> I<00:03:03.959> would<00:03:04.080> have<00:03:04.200> mini<00:03:04.410> bowls<00:03:04.709> and<00:03:04.890> I

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
and so I would have mini bowls and I

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.090 
and so I would have mini bowls and I
just<00:03:05.160> cut<00:03:05.370> little<00:03:05.640> sheet<00:03:06.330> of<00:03:06.480> this<00:03:06.600> out<00:03:06.780> and

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
just cut little sheet of this out and

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.370 
just cut little sheet of this out and
cover<00:03:08.100> all<00:03:08.250> your<00:03:08.280> paints<00:03:08.670> with<00:03:08.850> it<00:03:09.140> so<00:03:10.140> I<00:03:10.170> hope

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
cover all your paints with it so I hope
