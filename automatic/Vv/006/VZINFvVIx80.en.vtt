00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:17.660
 we are silent on the pig dax that is 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:20.330
 totally just really nice juicy and 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.609
 will have to pay just one couple 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:26.390
 things like that 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:29.359
 that's enough first sometimes the 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.460
 pigs salmon that is the back part 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:34.250
 The pig up here was longing 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.660
 and fat and swine salmon 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.269
 we do the first time from 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.700
 I have mine that is one 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:42.680
 especially slim knife comes with it 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.090
 one super under the tendon is the 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.260
 simply knife under the tendon 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:51.649
 pierced exactly diagonally upwards 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.450
 held and then along the tendon long 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:55.899
 pulled by that it becomes oblique 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:59.510
 We do not cut into the meat 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:01.610
 Cut was nice thick steaks 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.129
 if they are too thin , it works 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.020
 not really good for two 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.180
 centimeters should be it already 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.890
 in the meantime we can 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.510
 ever set up the flag I 've got it 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.670
 right on level seven vices 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.560
 nice by heating the steaks 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.640
 Let's make salted pepper 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.320
 later in the villa in the pan 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.210
 do not burn like that now 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.009
 be stingy and nice from both sides 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.380
 Spice up 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:26.720
 I like ten pieces of kitchens with it 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.000
 I'm the one away with it's his 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.560
 shape keeps it evenly everywhere 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.750
 is thick 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.270
 you do not have to do that you can 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.189
 if you have it really nice 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.880
 just want to knot with a double 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:44.329
 firmly bind the excess cord 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.950
 cut off and that's it's the flag 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:47.689
 actually quite good in the meantime 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.060
 heated by at least induction 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.439
 if it has field here or still his 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.200
 old metal plate also a bit 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:56.420
 we expect very little oil clean longer 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.590
 want to discuss the topic and not 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:03.770
 Deep fry the oil for now 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.689
 I'll give it right in and 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.579
 then cooled somewhat by also down 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:10.310
 that is why it is important that the 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:12.740
 pan is nicely heated by it 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.290
 not to lose too much 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.020
 if the meat is halfway here 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.490
 you can see that is beautiful because I just have to 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:25.280
 fried is then discolored easily 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:29.030
 in gray we turn the steaks a bit 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.710
 Oil is lacking a bit you know 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:37.280
 Always good at smoking when smoking 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:39.380
 one must it namely not then comes 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.420
 Cover it on the plate I put out 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.470
 and the flag come from the flame 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.180
 I have completely forgotten Thyme 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.580
 and rosemary to give to 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.490
 it can of course before directly 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.020
 to give the lid on it 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.450
 About five minutes later you can 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.090
 feel even 16 if they are certainly 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:07.430
 and mine here are exactly on the point 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:09.370
 now remove the cord left mine 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.990
 Steaks also already cut 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.310
 in that the heat is in the distance with 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.760
 they need to fall off the lid 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.410
 then no longer resting with it 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.120
 the meat juice calms down that 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.490
 happens here in the same way 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.970
 automatically with this I have here 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:28.130
 made a little mashed potatoes and 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.760
 Caramelized carrot with green bunch 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:36.500
 carrots very delicious and still 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.280
 prepared gravy longer needs you 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.870
 not on the plate 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.940
 and that's how it looks 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.940
 fresh basil total class
