00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:16.440
 dear friends, welcome to this new one 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:18.690
 minecraft episode this is the villa 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.600
 castle of the first series of the my 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.849
 friends and we are here unfortunately for 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.820
 tell you that the kraft ring ends here 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.859
 this will be symbolically because we are 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.210
 always in ever influences always in 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.130
 minecraft 1.2.5 first 6 to tell you exactly 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.350
 which unfortunately the ned kart cannot 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.210
 continue and not for our own reasons 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.190
 because unfortunately as you know e 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.370
 we always thank you for having had the 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.650
 We were guests to play with it 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.290
 of the series and therefore we did not control 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.440
 no the server world is high the server 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.690
 of the kraft ring mike does not exist 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.970
 more and apparently do not exist 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.820
 not even backup so we don't have 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.880
 no possibility to continue the 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.220
 series so unfortunately we have to say 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:07.350
 this is really the last episode of the 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.650
 ned that we are sorry because we will not see 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.049
 as never before over the exact home and not 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.880
 we will never potentially see other things 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.340
 that you have proposed to us to do 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.880
 series for this is how much it really isn't 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.799
 our fault and we hoped to see 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.329
 if there was any chance but you have 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.399
 since we didn't put it for a while 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:28.979
 new videos and aned cast here is the 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:31.020
 motivation cannot continue e 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.329
 you have probably seen others too 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.490
 wanting channels that participated that is 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.979
 it's all over so we're not 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.859
 been hunted or problems go just not 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.579
 there is no longer the world reserves anything 

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:45.090
 all of this 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.399
 so we can tell you from this world 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.499
 that from this never without the series are 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.630
 finish this series too but 

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:53.130
 influence ended hopefully 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.719
 however you enjoyed that what 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.899
 two act and we are certainly happy 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:59.540
 for all the ideas the things that 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.860
 you did it 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.230
 known thanks to you you have it 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.030
 advise to try right then 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.840
 all interesting things and advice 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.760
 that you gave us 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.259
 we are here to offer you more than he does 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.420
 itself a series because no it can be it 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.040
 then to start another one 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.900
 we want to call before doing this 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.090
 question to know that in the opa that stands for 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.440
 come back right we can you then you 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:23.000
 consider the opac that is about to return 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.830
 we have to settle but as you see so many 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.970
 projects we changed a vague fact 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.830
 return to the ex mod 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.350
 we are doing many mini games that 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.830
 however they leave a lot of variety because 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.990
 even if they are always see game but they are 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.970
 always different so I take a ride 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.040
 panoramic since I was not here 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.220
 in then just charge for those who don't 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.930
 had seen the first exact sepe series 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.550
 loved it so much we don't have 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.170
 never had time to decorate either 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.390
 this for the end of the series but in a 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.250
 way or the other left always of the 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.090
 its soon and never minded its signs 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:58.070
 so it is the opa that will just continue 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.459
 we will succeed because we have different things 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:03.709
 to do and we wanted to make a good return 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.989
 is valid in any case right for 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.030
 start making the video on the up 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.310
 that series we know you like 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.310
 like so much even though we believed 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.320
 to know if you were interested if we started 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.000
 saws on other packages maybe 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.030
 also then already known for 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.519
 to avoid having to keep up with it is then 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.950
 Exact misconceptions of crap ideas 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.480
 so if you have anyone from 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.610
 those do not know those who are part 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.140
 of the launcher technique or those 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.870
 which are part of the beast feed 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.910
 lounge or all the things you know that 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.220
 maybe we don't know well 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.410
 listen exactly so you write to us in 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.500
 comments are from the series of gods mod 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.520
 existing interesting packs for all 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.890
 versions you want 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.680
 let us know if you are looking for maybe not 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.600
 advise us a package that 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.170
 would become a series equal to the home 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.360
 pack as an idea as it will come back but 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.640
 maybe you recommend heaven a package 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.590
 maybe very new with new fashions 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.320
 interesting for us these things 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.840
 or maybe a more adventure package 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.090
 so to vary us who knows how many 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.180
 different years what you want then in 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.310
 so as to also support more than 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.650
 let's see if you recommend it almost 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.870
 we all do what we see 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.330
 that we especially recommend two e 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.430
 they are also a bit different diversified 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.020
 from above we could also make two new ones 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.700
 series on new mod 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.910
 if the transferor does not interest us that 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.320
 do others we serve dates or other 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.150
 kind of football so much so that there 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.070
 we will focus on the fight and of course 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.960
 on all the minigames the former fashion ltte 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.520
 custom maps other things we could 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.170
 to invent also because we have others 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.240
 projects that even new ones look at 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:42.620
 minecraft that we want to do very soon 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.930
 and we hope you enjoy it 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.960
 I liked the idea then about this 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:51.440
 tramo with this sunset in the north 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:53.780
 nerd kraft forever we are however for 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.580
 how sorry we are that you enjoyed it 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.540
 the series that it willingly tests 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.960
 our company 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:02.090
 therefore from our first world it is everything and 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.550
 thank you really presented with 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:09.160
