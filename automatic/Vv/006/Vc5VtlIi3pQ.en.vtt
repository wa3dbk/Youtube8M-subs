00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
already tied off at the top but do my

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.910 
already tied off at the top but do my
middle<00:03:01.080> ones<00:03:01.260> first<00:03:01.560> see<00:03:02.370> it<00:03:02.490> shaken<00:03:02.910> up

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.050 

there's<00:03:07.920> not<00:03:08.070> a<00:03:08.130> rust<00:03:08.670> this<00:03:09.090> one<00:03:09.240> is<00:03:09.360> bowed<00:03:09.630> out

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
there's not a rust this one is bowed out

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.050 
there's not a rust this one is bowed out
as<00:03:12.060> soon<00:03:12.270> as<00:03:12.300> I<00:03:13.010> line<00:03:14.010> it<00:03:14.040> up<00:03:14.310> a<00:03:14.430> little<00:03:14.550> bit<00:03:14.820> and

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
as soon as I line it up a little bit and

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.690 
as soon as I line it up a little bit and
clip<00:03:15.300> it<00:03:15.420> in<00:03:16.190> now<00:03:17.190> we're<00:03:17.460> getting<00:03:17.670> the

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
clip it in now we're getting the

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.090 
clip it in now we're getting the
formation<00:03:18.270> of<00:03:18.390> a<00:03:18.480> tent<00:03:18.780> let<00:03:19.650> me<00:03:19.710> see<00:03:19.890> if<00:03:19.980> I'm

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
formation of a tent let me see if I'm

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.630 
formation of a tent let me see if I'm
getting<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.810> whoops<00:03:22.220> see<00:03:23.220> if<00:03:23.280> I'm<00:03:23.400> getting

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
getting the whoops see if I'm getting

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.350 
getting the whoops see if I'm getting
the<00:03:23.700> whole<00:03:23.820> thing<00:03:23.850> yeah<00:03:24.330> can<00:03:25.230> you<00:03:25.260> see<00:03:25.560> that<00:03:25.770> I

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
the whole thing yeah can you see that I

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.550 
the whole thing yeah can you see that I
might<00:03:27.360> have<00:03:27.480> missed<00:03:27.690> it<00:03:27.840> but<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:28.050> main<00:03:28.260> thing

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
might have missed it but the main thing

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.840 
might have missed it but the main thing
was<00:03:28.709> just<00:03:28.740> to<00:03:29.070> grab<00:03:29.310> it<00:03:29.459> at<00:03:29.580> the<00:03:29.610> top

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
was just to grab it at the top

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.620 
was just to grab it at the top
let's<00:03:32.850> lift<00:03:33.060> off<00:03:33.330> at<00:03:34.170> this<00:03:34.350> point<00:03:35.090> you<00:03:36.090> can<00:03:36.270> see

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
let's lift off at this point you can see

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.600 
let's lift off at this point you can see
that<00:03:36.900> the<00:03:37.320> tent<00:03:37.590> is<00:03:37.709> essentially<00:03:38.340> built

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
that the tent is essentially built

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.940 
that the tent is essentially built
everything<00:03:39.540> after<00:03:40.020> this<00:03:40.230> is<00:03:40.500> just<00:03:40.709> simply

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
everything after this is just simply

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.680 
everything after this is just simply
going<00:03:41.190> to<00:03:41.250> be<00:03:43.100> routine<00:03:44.100> and<00:03:44.550> not<00:03:44.760> not<00:03:45.630> a

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
going to be routine and not not a

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.780 
going to be routine and not not a
problem<00:03:46.200> but<00:03:46.770> the<00:03:46.920> idea<00:03:47.280> is<00:03:47.690> when<00:03:48.690> you<00:03:49.790> connect

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
problem but the idea is when you connect

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.720 
problem but the idea is when you connect
the<00:03:50.850> poles<00:03:51.180> first<00:03:51.660> stake<00:03:52.260> it<00:03:52.410> in<00:03:53.510> next<00:03:55.730> connect

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
the poles first stake it in next connect

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.120 
the poles first stake it in next connect
the<00:03:56.820> pins<00:03:57.450> toward<00:03:58.140> the<00:03:58.290> door<00:03:58.500> that's<00:03:58.920> so<00:03:59.070> you

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
the pins toward the door that's so you

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.820 
the pins toward the door that's so you
can<00:03:59.220> step<00:03:59.670> in<00:03:59.850> the<00:04:00.000> door<00:04:00.180> and<00:04:01.050> get<00:04:01.350> this<00:04:01.530> done

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
can step in the door and get this done

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.060 
can step in the door and get this done
okay<00:04:02.190> then<00:04:03.060> let's<00:04:03.810> continue<00:04:04.200> on<00:04:04.709> with<00:04:04.739> our

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
okay then let's continue on with our

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.900 
okay then let's continue on with our
one-man<00:04:05.730> lift<00:04:06.150> one<00:04:06.630> person<00:04:07.080> with<00:04:07.910> another

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
one-man lift one person with another

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:09.560 
one-man lift one person with another
good<00:04:09.180> trick

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
good trick

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.800 
good trick
it's<00:04:10.280> pre-attached<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.640> rain<00:04:11.880> fly<00:04:12.209> see<00:04:12.660> how

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
it's pre-attached the rain fly see how

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.050 
it's pre-attached the rain fly see how
I've<00:04:12.900> got<00:04:12.930> the<00:04:13.709> rain<00:04:13.920> fly<00:04:14.190> attached<00:04:14.610> already

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
I've got the rain fly attached already

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.469 
I've got the rain fly attached already
hooked<00:04:15.299> in<00:04:15.450> the<00:04:15.570> back<00:04:15.750> take<00:04:16.530> a<00:04:16.560> wrap<00:04:17.450> so<00:04:18.450> that

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
hooked in the back take a wrap so that

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:24.589 
hooked in the back take a wrap so that
it<00:04:18.660> won't<00:04:18.840> get<00:04:19.019> away<00:04:19.260> from

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:24.599 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:30.540 

out<00:04:25.770> here<00:04:26.770> that<00:04:26.979> click<00:04:27.819> into<00:04:28.210> the<00:04:28.360> ring<00:04:29.550> that

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
out here that click into the ring that

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.730 
out here that click into the ring that
might<00:04:30.789> be<00:04:30.910> too<00:04:31.120> much<00:04:31.150> I<00:04:31.690> already<00:04:32.380> have<00:04:32.590> the

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
might be too much I already have the

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.550 
might be too much I already have the
poll<00:04:33.300> pretty<00:04:34.300> strong<00:04:34.599> this<00:04:34.780> is<00:04:34.960> a<00:04:34.990> standard

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
poll pretty strong this is a standard

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.999 
poll pretty strong this is a standard
rain<00:04:35.770> fly<00:04:36.009> poll<00:04:36.310> just<00:04:36.340> bend<00:04:37.030> the<00:04:37.240> pole

stick it in it's red now I know these
corners<00:04:41.440> are<00:04:41.530> gonna<00:04:41.710> be<00:04:41.800> attached<00:04:42.099> so<00:04:42.340> here<00:04:42.729> we

00:04:42.809 --> 00:04:42.819 
corners are gonna be attached so here we

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
I'm going to go over connect this first

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.990 
I'm going to go over connect this first
go<00:04:50.620> out<00:04:50.770> back<00:04:51.009> and<00:04:51.310> then<00:04:51.460> we'll<00:04:51.610> see<00:04:51.759> how<00:04:51.789> we

did here we go I gotta get one for the
pass<00:05:05.830> first

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.570 

okay<00:05:13.020> let's<00:05:13.290> try<00:05:13.500> that<00:05:13.590> again<00:05:13.800> so<00:05:14.310> you<00:05:14.370> can<00:05:14.520> see

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
okay let's try that again so you can see

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.690 
okay let's try that again so you can see
it<00:05:15.000> this<00:05:15.150> time<00:05:15.450> we've<00:05:15.660> got<00:05:15.690> a<00:05:15.810> wider<00:05:16.080> shot

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.700 
it this time we've got a wider shot

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.790 
it this time we've got a wider shot
essentially<00:05:17.700> I've<00:05:18.480> got<00:05:18.750> the<00:05:18.930> rain<00:05:19.140> fly<00:05:19.170> tied

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
essentially I've got the rain fly tied

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.840 
essentially I've got the rain fly tied
off<00:05:20.100> at<00:05:20.310> these<00:05:20.520> two<00:05:20.730> corners<00:05:22.490> I've<00:05:23.490> got<00:05:23.700> my

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 
lined up and that's the rainfly if

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.640

you're<00:06:37.270> doing<00:06:37.540> it<00:06:37.660> single-handedly<00:06:38.050> of

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:38.650 
you're doing it single-handedly of

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:40.530

bit<00:06:40.690> of<00:06:40.810> effort<00:06:45.240> and<00:06:46.240> I<00:06:46.390> think<00:06:46.690> that<00:06:46.960> will<00:06:47.140> wrap

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:47.380 
bit of effort and I think that will wrap

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:51.510 
bit of effort and I think that will wrap
up<00:06:47.590> a<00:06:47.710> one<00:06:47.950> person<00:06:48.490> tent<00:06:48.760> pitch<00:06:50.250> so<00:06:51.250> you<00:06:51.310> can
