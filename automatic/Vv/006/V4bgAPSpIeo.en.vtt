carry with a tip down and I have a shot

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:15.670 
carry with a tip down and I have a shot
of<00:01:02.160> what<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.370> looks<00:01:02.550> like<00:01:02.609> in<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.000> pocket

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.170 

all<00:01:16.310> right<00:01:16.490> so<00:01:16.640> that's<00:01:16.730> what<00:01:16.880> it<00:01:16.970> looks<00:01:17.000> like

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
all right so that's what it looks like

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.670 
all right so that's what it looks like
when<00:01:17.330> you're<00:01:17.420> carrying<00:01:17.720> this<00:01:17.810> knife<00:01:18.050> now<00:01:18.620> you

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
when you're carrying this knife now you

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.680 
when you're carrying this knife now you
do<00:01:18.860> have<00:01:19.130> the<00:01:19.430> option<00:01:19.580> of<00:01:19.880> thumb<00:01:20.180> studs<00:01:20.420> there

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
do have the option of thumb studs there

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.170 
do have the option of thumb studs there
or<00:01:20.960> the<00:01:21.470> flipper<00:01:21.710> that<00:01:22.130> does<00:01:22.340> right<00:01:22.580> on<00:01:22.790> the

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180

or the flipper that does right on the
ikbs<00:01:24.080> system<00:01:24.760> so<00:01:25.760> when<00:01:25.970> you<00:01:26.060> flip<00:01:26.270> it<00:01:26.360> out<00:01:26.680> it's

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
ikbs system so when you flip it out it's

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.610 
ikbs system so when you flip it out it's
nice<00:01:27.800> and<00:01:28.040> smooth<00:01:28.310> you<00:01:28.670> get<00:01:29.390> the<00:01:30.110> tip<00:01:30.380> here

nice and smooth you get the tip here
it's<00:01:30.770> not<00:01:30.920> really<00:01:31.190> a<00:01:31.780> full<00:01:32.780> sheepsfoot<00:01:33.229> more

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
it's not really a full sheepsfoot more

actually<00:01:52.820> a<00:01:53.060> lock<00:01:53.300> back<00:01:53.630> and<00:01:54.350> you<00:01:54.710> have<00:01:54.830> to

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
actually a lock back and you have to

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.370 
actually a lock back and you have to
press<00:01:55.160> right<00:01:55.399> here<00:01:55.430> to<00:01:56.210> release<00:01:56.479> the<00:01:56.720> blade<00:01:56.990> so

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
press right here to release the blade so

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.790 
press right here to release the blade so
pressing<00:01:57.740> it<00:01:58.840> brings<00:01:59.840> you<00:02:00.050> into<00:02:00.350> that<00:02:00.560> closed

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
position the thumb studs there are

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.200 
position the thumb studs there are
accessible<00:02:04.190> you're<00:02:04.640> not<00:02:04.759> going<00:02:04.910> to<00:02:04.970> be<00:02:05.060> able

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
accessible you're not going to be able

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.240 
accessible you're not going to be able
to<00:02:05.270> flip<00:02:05.509> it<00:02:05.630> open<00:02:05.930> with<00:02:06.080> them<00:02:06.259> well<00:02:06.950> you<00:02:07.100> might

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
to flip it open with them well you might

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.010 
to flip it open with them well you might
be<00:02:07.369> able<00:02:07.460> to<00:02:07.670> but<00:02:07.910> I'm<00:02:08.149> not<00:02:08.330> good<00:02:08.509> enough<00:02:08.540> to<00:02:08.869> do

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
be able to but I'm not good enough to do

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.600 
be able to but I'm not good enough to do
that<00:02:10.239> I'll<00:02:11.239> just<00:02:11.510> use<00:02:11.690> the<00:02:11.870> flipper<00:02:12.200> for<00:02:12.350> that

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
that I'll just use the flipper for that

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.800 
that I'll just use the flipper for that
so<00:02:13.610> let's<00:02:13.940> take<00:02:14.090> a<00:02:14.120> look<00:02:14.360> at<00:02:14.510> some

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
so let's take a look at some

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.910 
so let's take a look at some
measurements<00:02:15.380> overall<00:02:16.370> length<00:02:16.670> on<00:02:17.000> this<00:02:17.180> one

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
measurements overall length on this one

where they've cut it out does create
some<00:03:17.000> hot<00:03:17.209> spots<00:03:17.510> there<00:03:17.780> are<00:03:17.840> some<00:03:18.079> edges

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
some hot spots there are some edges

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.940 
some hot spots there are some edges
there<00:03:18.769> so<00:03:19.430> in<00:03:19.730> the<00:03:19.850> hand<00:03:20.200> it<00:03:21.200> does<00:03:21.440> rub<00:03:21.739> a

that as with most lock backs again you

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.870 
that as with most lock backs again you

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.800 
in a serrated model and the stration is
kind<00:03:46.850> of<00:03:46.880> interesting<00:03:47.060> and<00:03:47.390> see<00:03:47.570> it's

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
kind of interesting and see it's

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.920 
kind of interesting and see it's
flattened<00:03:48.680> out<00:03:48.800> rather<00:03:49.130> than<00:03:49.340> coming<00:03:49.610> to<00:03:49.730> a<00:03:50.120> a

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
backside you can see they haven't

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.110

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
notched it at all really so definitely a

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.890 
notched it at all really so definitely a
