00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:06.559 

okay<00:05:04.289> so<00:05:04.619> that's<00:05:04.800> up<00:05:05.039> apart<00:05:05.610> and<00:05:05.849> then<00:05:05.969> the<00:05:06.419> end

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:06.569 
okay so that's up apart and then the end

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:15.439 
okay so that's up apart and then the end
into<00:05:06.809> this<00:05:06.899> I<00:05:07.080> think<00:05:13.879> okay<00:05:14.879> so<00:05:14.909> you<00:05:15.179> go<00:05:15.300> back

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:15.449 
into this I think okay so you go back

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:20.449 
into this I think okay so you go back
down<00:05:15.599> to<00:05:15.629> the<00:05:15.779> g-string<00:05:16.229> the<00:05:17.099> back<00:05:17.279> up<00:05:17.429> see<00:05:19.459> so

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:20.459 
down to the g-string the back up see so

00:05:20.459 --> 00:05:23.029 
down to the g-string the back up see so
that's<00:05:20.669> that<00:05:20.819> whole<00:05:20.969> section<00:05:21.300> so<00:05:22.199> once<00:05:22.860> you've

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 
that's that whole section so once you've

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:25.219 
that's that whole section so once you've
added<00:05:23.129> it<00:05:23.369> then<00:05:24.029> it<00:05:24.119> kind<00:05:24.300> of<00:05:24.360> gels<00:05:25.050> together

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:25.229 
added it then it kind of gels together

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:28.909 
added it then it kind of gels together
like<00:05:25.619> it<00:05:25.979> should<00:05:26.009> um<00:05:26.929> after<00:05:27.929> that<00:05:28.289> you<00:05:28.619> go<00:05:28.740> back

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 
like it should um after that you go back

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:36.469 
like it should um after that you go back
to<00:05:29.129> the<00:05:33.169> and<00:05:34.169> then<00:05:34.879> apart<00:05:35.879> after<00:05:36.029> that<00:05:36.300> I'm

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
to the and then apart after that I'm

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:40.129 
to the and then apart after that I'm
still<00:05:36.749> working<00:05:37.139> on<00:05:37.259> that's<00:05:38.839> not<00:05:39.839> quite<00:05:39.959> right

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:40.139 
still working on that's not quite right

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:43.179
