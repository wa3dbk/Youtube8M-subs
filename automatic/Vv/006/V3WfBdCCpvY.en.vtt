what are they trying to say and yeah
there<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.439> can<00:01:52.950> think<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.310> some<00:01:53.520> if<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.390> had<00:01:54.540> a

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
there I can think of some if I had a

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.550 
there I can think of some if I had a
little<00:01:54.750> longer<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.110> think<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.409> some

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
little longer and think of some

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.980 
little longer and think of some
ridiculous<00:01:56.130> notes<00:01:56.850> we've<00:01:57.000> gotten<00:01:57.390> but<00:01:57.869> it's

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
ridiculous notes we've gotten but it's

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.179 
ridiculous notes we've gotten but it's
still<00:01:58.229> there's<00:01:58.500> something<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:58.920> they're

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
still there's something that they're

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.819 
still there's something that they're
reacting<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.750> would<00:02:00.930> miss<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.469> think

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
reacting to and I would miss it I think

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.560 
reacting to and I would miss it I think
on<00:02:01.979> some<00:02:02.250> level<00:02:02.280> if<00:02:02.820> that<00:02:03.180> weren't<00:02:03.390> there<00:02:03.450> and

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
on some level if that weren't there and

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.330 
on some level if that weren't there and
it<00:02:03.840> does<00:02:04.020> worried<00:02:04.259> in<00:02:04.320> Netflix<00:02:04.530> now<00:02:04.890> is
