doing an unboxing of my stuff but it's
not<00:00:10.000> really<00:00:10.240> an<00:00:10.420> unboxing<00:00:10.690> because<00:00:11.379> i<00:00:11.709> unbox

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:12.459 
not really an unboxing because i unbox

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:14.190 
not really an unboxing because i unbox
it<00:00:12.580> earlier<00:00:12.880> and<00:00:13.179> my<00:00:13.389> camera<00:00:13.599> was<00:00:13.780> sit<00:00:13.990> on<00:00:14.110> the

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:14.200 
it earlier and my camera was sit on the

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.589 
it earlier and my camera was sit on the
desk<00:00:14.469> and<00:00:14.799> it<00:00:15.040> wasn't<00:00:15.339> it<00:00:15.400> right<00:00:15.639> angle<00:00:16.000> so<00:00:16.180> it

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:16.599 
desk and it wasn't it right angle so it

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:18.450 
desk and it wasn't it right angle so it
doesn't<00:00:16.840> capture<00:00:17.050> me<00:00:17.380> unboxing<00:00:17.980> it<00:00:18.130> at<00:00:18.220> all<00:00:18.310> of

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:18.460 
doesn't capture me unboxing it at all of

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.909 
doesn't capture me unboxing it at all of
showing<00:00:18.849> you<00:00:19.000> my<00:00:19.180> controller<00:00:19.540> so<00:00:20.320> I<00:00:20.650> thought

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:20.919 
showing you my controller so I thought

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:22.560 
showing you my controller so I thought
I'd<00:00:21.070> read<00:00:21.279> her<00:00:21.399> but<00:00:21.849> I<00:00:21.880> had<00:00:22.090> played<00:00:22.329> with<00:00:22.360> it

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.570 
I'd read her but I had played with it

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.389 
I'd read her but I had played with it
today<00:00:22.689> so<00:00:22.810> it's<00:00:22.989> not<00:00:23.169> the<00:00:23.380> original<00:00:23.680> sort<00:00:24.309> of

00:00:24.389 --> 00:00:24.399 
today so it's not the original sort of

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:26.729 
today so it's not the original sort of
way<00:00:24.910> it<00:00:25.059> was<00:00:25.180> packed<00:00:25.450> but<00:00:25.750> um<00:00:26.169> it's<00:00:26.470> close

00:00:26.729 --> 00:00:26.739 
way it was packed but um it's close

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:29.100 
way it was packed but um it's close
enough<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:28.210> I<00:00:28.300> would<00:00:28.480> be<00:00:28.689> doing<00:00:28.809> like<00:00:28.989> an

it's<00:02:55.579> really<00:02:56.060> nice<00:02:56.180> controller<00:02:56.689> I<00:02:56.900> really

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
it's really nice controller I really

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.189 
it's really nice controller I really
like<00:02:57.859> it<00:02:58.040> really<00:02:58.480> I've<00:02:59.480> never<00:02:59.540> had<00:02:59.900> a<00:02:59.930> wired

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:00.199 
like it really I've never had a wired

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:02.050 
like it really I've never had a wired
one<00:03:00.290> so<00:03:00.530> it's<00:03:00.650> a<00:03:00.709> lot<00:03:00.829> lighter<00:03:01.189> than<00:03:01.609> my<00:03:01.909> old

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
one so it's a lot lighter than my old

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.149 
one so it's a lot lighter than my old
ones<00:03:03.069> and<00:03:05.169> you<00:03:06.169> know<00:03:06.290> it<00:03:06.500> feels<00:03:06.650> really<00:03:06.949> nice

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
is I usually squeeze my control when I

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.990 
is I usually squeeze my control when I
drop<00:03:11.359> shot<00:03:11.569> and<00:03:12.459> you<00:03:13.459> know<00:03:13.519> I<00:03:13.579> just<00:03:13.669> got<00:03:13.879> to<00:03:13.939> get

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:30.979 
really handy it doesn't get any of the

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:33.009 
really handy it doesn't get any of the
grip<00:03:31.370> or<00:03:31.549> anything<00:03:31.909> expensive<00:03:32.269> I<00:03:32.629> went<00:03:32.840> for<00:03:32.959> a

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
grip or anything expensive I went for a

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.649 
grip or anything expensive I went for a
cheap<00:03:33.259> one<00:03:33.639> I'm<00:03:34.639> going<00:03:34.849> together<00:03:35.060> a<00:03:35.239> thing<00:03:35.509> it

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:35.659 
cheap one I'm going together a thing it

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:40.030 
cheap one I'm going together a thing it
cost<00:03:35.840> me<00:03:36.310> 180<00:03:37.310> um<00:03:38.269> in<00:03:38.599> my<00:03:38.989> currency<00:03:39.500> over<00:03:39.859> here

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
cost me 180 um in my currency over here

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.729 
cost me 180 um in my currency over here
so<00:03:40.790> it's<00:03:41.750> about<00:03:41.840> two<00:03:42.769> controls<00:03:43.599> or<00:03:44.599> that<00:03:45.530> that

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
so it's about two controls or that that

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:47.289 
so it's about two controls or that that
included<00:03:46.430> tripping<00:03:46.729> to<00:03:46.879> the<00:03:46.970> controller

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
included tripping to the controller

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:49.809 
included tripping to the controller
itself<00:03:47.689> was<00:03:47.840> about<00:03:48.049> one<00:03:48.229> and<00:03:48.349> a<00:03:48.439> half<00:03:48.819> maybe

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
itself was about one and a half maybe

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.599 
itself was about one and a half maybe
one<00:03:50.180> and<00:03:50.329> three-quarter<00:03:50.870> controllers

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609 
one and three-quarter controllers

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:55.479 
one and three-quarter controllers
two-thirds<00:03:52.609> maybe<00:03:53.620> but<00:03:54.620> yeah<00:03:54.769> so<00:03:55.069> I<00:03:55.099> read<00:03:55.340> it

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
two-thirds maybe but yeah so I read it

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.580 
two-thirds maybe but yeah so I read it
was<00:03:55.609> really<00:03:55.849> good<00:03:55.939> value<00:03:56.290> but<00:03:57.290> if<00:03:57.379> you<00:03:57.469> are

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
was really good value but if you are
