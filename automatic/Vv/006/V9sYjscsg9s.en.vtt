Hello,
This is Praveen.

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:08.120
Here is the unboxing and the review of Apple
MacBook Air 2014 model.

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.320
While the ultrabook market has become quite
popular, the 13-inch MacBook Air has continued

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.540
to be one of the best thin-and-light laptops
around.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:23.829
We have got this in a great deal at Amazon
India for Rs. 57695 as the retailers are selling

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:25.560
it for Rs.65900.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.779
You can check the link provided here in the
description of this video to get yours at

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.550
the same price.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.239
It comes with premium level boxed package
and Let me remove the cover off to show the

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:39.460
beautiful boy.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.649
Here we can see, it is protected with a black
couch.

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.920
Here comes the beautiful boy with Apple logo
on the top.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.289
The laptop weighs about 3 kgs and is very
thin.

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.120
Let me show you the accessories that comes
along with the box.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:11.130
Here is the Indian model charging adapter

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:25.280
and few extension cables.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:43.640
Apart from these, we have some guiding manuals
with Apple stickers.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.979
Let me remove the plastic cover on the Macbook.

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.040
Here we can see it is soo thin.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.790
On the sides of the MacBook Air you'll find
only a few ports, with one charging port,

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:02.780
USB 3.0 port, and a headphone jack on the
left, nothing there at the back and a second

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:11.790
USB 3.0 port, an SDXC card slot, and a Thunderbolt
port on the right.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.239
You won't find an HDMI port on the laptop
but you can convert the Thunderbolt port to

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:22.849
HDMI or other common ports, like Ethernet
or VGA, through an adapter dongle that should

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:23.849
be sold separately.

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:31.760
Open up the slim laptop, and you'll be greeted
by a familiar 13.3-inch, LED-backlit screen.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.090
The display has a 1,440-by-900 resolution,
with brilliant colors and a glossy finish

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.410
that is a tad reflective, but offers deep
blacks and colors that pop.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:50.420
Above the display is a 720p webcam, and inside
the MacBook Air is equipped with 802.11ac

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.110
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:00.600
This MacBook Air comes with Marverics and
equipped with 1.6GHz Intel Core i5 Processor,

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.870
128GB SSD Harddrive, 4Gigs of RAM and Intel
HD Graphics.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:15.050
Let us show you the thickness comparison between
a MacBook Air and Pro.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:52.310
Let me boot the boy first.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.310
Let us show the system properties.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.980
As we have said earlier, it’s a 13inch Macbook
air with Intel HD Graphics.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:09.090
Storage is 128GB where 101 GB is user accessible
and the RAM is 4GB which is not possible to

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.430
upgrade in future.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:24.820
The gestures are quite impressive.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.530
If you are looking to get one, then this the
best time.

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.830
