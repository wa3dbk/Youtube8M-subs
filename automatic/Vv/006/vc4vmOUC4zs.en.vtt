00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
counter-attacks there's there's combos

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.980 
counter-attacks there's there's combos
you<00:01:56.310> can<00:01:56.460> string<00:01:56.700> together<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:57.299> think<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.810> can

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
you can string together I think you can

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.830 
you can string together I think you can
string<00:01:58.259> together<00:01:58.820> combos<00:01:59.820> with<00:02:00.119> other<00:02:00.299> combos

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
string together combos with other combos

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.639 
string together combos with other combos
just<00:02:01.409> just<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.829> lot<00:02:02.130> of<00:02:02.310> stuff<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:02.670> can<00:02:02.700> do<00:02:03.000> I

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
just just a lot of stuff you can do I

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.709 
just just a lot of stuff you can do I
certainly<00:02:04.649> didn't<00:02:04.950> do<00:02:05.100> even<00:02:05.969> half<00:02:06.450> of<00:02:06.570> the

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
certainly didn't do even half of the

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.919 
certainly didn't do even half of the
stuff<00:02:06.930> available<00:02:07.860> but<00:02:08.580> if<00:02:09.209> you<00:02:09.509> want<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.750> just

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
stuff available but if you want to just

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.059 
stuff available but if you want to just
play<00:02:10.140> through<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.379> game

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
play through the game

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.099 
play through the game
you<00:02:11.609> could<00:02:11.909> button<00:02:12.299> mash<00:02:12.480> your<00:02:12.719> way<00:02:12.840> through

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:13.109 
you could button mash your way through

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:16.190 
you could button mash your way through
although<00:02:13.769> there<00:02:13.980> is<00:02:14.129> this<00:02:14.400> one<00:02:14.819> part<00:02:15.389> but<00:02:16.019> yeah

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
although there is this one part but yeah

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.009 
although there is this one part but yeah
this<00:02:16.980> was<00:02:17.040> really<00:02:17.489> just<00:02:18.359> a<00:02:18.480> really<00:02:18.689> good<00:02:18.840> game

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
this was really just a really good game

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.500 
this was really just a really good game
there's<00:02:19.620> not<00:02:19.799> a<00:02:19.829> lot<00:02:20.040> I<00:02:20.280> can<00:02:20.819> sit<00:02:20.999> I<00:02:21.150> can<00:02:21.299> say

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
there's not a lot I can sit I can say

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.929 
there's not a lot I can sit I can say
that's<00:02:22.409> bad<00:02:22.620> about<00:02:22.889> it<00:02:23.209> if<00:02:24.209> anything<00:02:25.170> it's

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:25.939 
that's bad about it if anything it's

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:29.360 
that's bad about it if anything it's
probably<00:02:26.939> the<00:02:27.209> shortest<00:02:27.540> ps3<00:02:28.319> game<00:02:28.530> I've<00:02:28.920> ever

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
probably the shortest ps3 game I've ever

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.800 
probably the shortest ps3 game I've ever
played<00:02:30.379> so<00:02:31.379> it<00:02:32.040> only<00:02:32.639> will<00:02:32.939> take<00:02:33.120> about<00:02:33.359> six

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
played so it only will take about six

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.429 
played so it only will take about six
hours<00:02:33.989> to<00:02:34.319> be<00:02:34.439> and<00:02:35.750> there<00:02:36.750> are<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.139> result

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:37.439 
hours to be and there are the result

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:38.839 
hours to be and there are the result
there's<00:02:37.650> only<00:02:37.799> a<00:02:37.889> couple<00:02:37.919> of<00:02:38.280> extra<00:02:38.819> things

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
there's only a couple of extra things

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.229 
there's only a couple of extra things
you<00:02:39.209> can<00:02:39.359> do<00:02:39.569> and<00:02:40.609> for<00:02:41.609> the<00:02:41.730> most<00:02:41.849> part<00:02:41.969> they're

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
you can do and for the most part they're

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.649 
you can do and for the most part they're
not<00:02:42.389> worth<00:02:42.900> it<00:02:43.139> but<00:02:43.919> it's<00:02:44.519> it's<00:02:45.299> one<00:02:45.480> of<00:02:45.569> those

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
not worth it but it's it's one of those

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:47.869 
not worth it but it's it's one of those
games<00:02:45.810> that<00:02:46.019> I<00:02:46.109> look<00:02:46.379> at<00:02:46.560> as<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:47.609> kind<00:02:47.819> of

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
games that I look at as the kind of

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:50.449 
games that I look at as the kind of
movie<00:02:48.030> that<00:02:48.150> you<00:02:48.299> want<00:02:48.480> to<00:02:48.540> help<00:02:49.099> it's<00:02:50.099> it's

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
movie that you want to help it's it's

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.250 
movie that you want to help it's it's
just<00:02:50.639> one<00:02:50.819> of<00:02:50.849> those<00:02:50.939> things<00:02:51.030> you<00:02:51.329> every<00:02:52.109> so

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
just one of those things you every so

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.959 
just one of those things you every so
often<00:02:52.469> you're<00:02:52.829> like<00:02:53.010> oh<00:02:53.129> I<00:02:53.159> want<00:02:53.459> a<00:02:53.519> good<00:02:53.669> story

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:53.969 
often you're like oh I want a good story

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:59.059 
often you're like oh I want a good story
with<00:02:54.209> some<00:02:54.419> good<00:02:55.409> graphics<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.219> well<00:02:57.150> made<00:02:58.069> so

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
with some good graphics and well made so

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.390 
with some good graphics and well made so
just<00:02:59.730> like<00:02:59.879> a<00:02:59.909> movie<00:03:00.120> sit<00:03:01.049> down<00:03:01.129> put<00:03:02.129> the<00:03:02.250> game

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
just like a movie sit down put the game

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.470 
just like a movie sit down put the game
in<00:03:02.719> six<00:03:03.719> hours<00:03:03.840> that's<00:03:04.290> it<00:03:04.469> and<00:03:05.340> from<00:03:06.299> what<00:03:06.419> I

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
in six hours that's it and from what I

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.479 
in six hours that's it and from what I
remember<00:03:06.629> there's<00:03:06.989> only<00:03:07.079> one<00:03:07.409> part<00:03:07.769> that<00:03:08.099> that

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
remember there's only one part that that

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.539 
remember there's only one part that that
drags<00:03:08.879> a<00:03:09.090> little<00:03:09.299> bit<00:03:09.480> and<00:03:09.650> it's<00:03:10.650> it's<00:03:11.310> a<00:03:11.519> it's

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
drags a little bit and it's it's a it's

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.689 
drags a little bit and it's it's a it's
a<00:03:11.939> sequence<00:03:12.359> where<00:03:12.419> you<00:03:12.659> have<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:13.699> defend

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:14.699 
a sequence where you have to defend

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:19.699 
a sequence where you have to defend
somebody<00:03:15.739> using<00:03:16.739> arrows<00:03:17.099> and<00:03:18.409> you're<00:03:19.409> pretty

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
somebody using arrows and you're pretty

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.879 
somebody using arrows and you're pretty
far<00:03:20.069> away<00:03:20.189> and<00:03:20.609> it<00:03:20.970> can<00:03:21.329> it<00:03:22.049> gets<00:03:22.229> it<00:03:22.500> goes<00:03:22.709> on

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889 
far away and it can it gets it goes on

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:24.349 
far away and it can it gets it goes on
for<00:03:23.069> so<00:03:23.189> long<00:03:23.220> that<00:03:23.459> that's<00:03:23.849> pretty<00:03:24.060> general

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
for so long that that's pretty general

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:26.330 
for so long that that's pretty general
or<00:03:24.509> drowning<00:03:24.720> but<00:03:25.019> again<00:03:25.319> by<00:03:25.889> this<00:03:26.040> by<00:03:26.310> this

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
or drowning but again by this by this

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.640 
or drowning but again by this by this
point<00:03:26.669> you'll<00:03:26.939> probably<00:03:27.659> be<00:03:28.049> having<00:03:28.319> fun<00:03:28.349> with

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
point you'll probably be having fun with

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.039 
point you'll probably be having fun with
arrows<00:03:28.919> so<00:03:29.250> a<00:03:29.519> lot<00:03:30.359> of<00:03:30.389> people<00:03:30.689> like<00:03:30.780> to<00:03:30.840> say

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
arrows so a lot of people like to say

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.080 
arrows so a lot of people like to say
that<00:03:31.199> it's<00:03:31.349> a<00:03:31.409> ripoff<00:03:31.680> of<00:03:31.739> god<00:03:32.040> of<00:03:32.159> war<00:03:32.340> and<00:03:32.609> in

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
that it's a ripoff of god of war and in

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.719 
that it's a ripoff of god of war and in
some<00:03:33.299> ways<00:03:33.449> it<00:03:33.689> kind<00:03:33.870> of<00:03:33.959> is<00:03:34.109> because<00:03:34.709> the<00:03:35.310> the

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:35.729 
some ways it kind of is because the the

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:37.759 
some ways it kind of is because the the
attack<00:03:36.030> styles<00:03:36.540> can<00:03:36.750> get<00:03:37.049> pretty<00:03:37.290> similar

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
attack styles can get pretty similar

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.309 
attack styles can get pretty similar
it's<00:03:38.579> not<00:03:38.699> a<00:03:38.759> problem<00:03:38.939> I<00:03:39.269> mean<00:03:39.449> they're<00:03:40.199> like

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
it's not a problem I mean they're like

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.289 
it's not a problem I mean they're like
God<00:03:40.500> war<00:03:40.739> style<00:03:41.009> play<00:03:41.340> you<00:03:41.759> should<00:03:41.970> like<00:03:42.120> this

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
God war style play you should like this

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:43.819 
God war style play you should like this
too<00:03:42.509> so<00:03:43.049> this<00:03:43.169> is<00:03:43.199> game<00:03:43.439> that<00:03:43.590> I<00:03:43.620> would

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
too so this is game that I would

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.800 
too so this is game that I would
certainly<00:03:44.099> recommend<00:03:44.329> if<00:03:45.329> you<00:03:45.479> can<00:03:45.629> get<00:03:45.780> past

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
certainly recommend if you can get past

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.219 
certainly recommend if you can get past
the<00:03:46.169> fact<00:03:46.319> that<00:03:46.470> it<00:03:46.620> is<00:03:46.739> a<00:03:46.769> short<00:03:47.069> game

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:48.229 
the fact that it is a short game

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:50.420 
the fact that it is a short game
possibly<00:03:49.229> the<00:03:49.409> shortest<00:03:49.739> available<00:03:50.220> on<00:03:50.340> the

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
possibly the shortest available on the

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
that part I I don't think it does that

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.060 
that part I I don't think it does that
for<00:04:21.359> the<00:04:21.659> rest<00:04:21.779> of<00:04:21.900> the<00:04:21.989> game<00:04:22.169> but<00:04:22.500> I<00:04:22.560> don't

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
for the rest of the game but I don't

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.770 
for the rest of the game but I don't
know<00:04:23.190> why<00:04:24.000> it

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
know why it

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.060 
know why it
starts<00:04:24.990> off<00:04:25.080> like<00:04:25.260> that<00:04:25.410> I<00:04:25.470> know<00:04:25.830> there's<00:04:26.010> a

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
starts off like that I know there's a

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.360 
starts off like that I know there's a
lot<00:04:26.100> of<00:04:26.220> people<00:04:26.430> to<00:04:26.910> render<00:04:27.180> here<00:04:27.420> but<00:04:28.370> it's
