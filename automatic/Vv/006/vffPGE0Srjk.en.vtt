00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.760
 here comes the haunting training 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.619
 come level 3 this judge now 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.750
 to the people already the stage 1 and 2 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.369
 have mastered and in which at the 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.380
 test results is that he 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.480
 shorten a weakness in long life 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.239
 cycle possesses that means in the counter 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.340
 movement jem vaccination with counter movement 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:34.260
 if this jump with the countermovement 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.630
 is 0 to 4 percent greater its 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.370
 fight which we also tested then 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.820
 this program is just right 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.559
 for you 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.390
 On the other hand, it can also be that 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.000
 for example volleyballer since or 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.070
 especially easier to lay the state 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.550
 So improve the start blockStart 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.320
 want 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.690
 for this time it is also very useful 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.150
 as we again a great attention 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.740
 on the long the shortening zuges 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.100
 put that means in a big one 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:01.110
 Amplitude in arm in leg in the jump joint 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.049
 and jump that high 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.659
 First you do the wide-legged 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.700
 high jumps but you jump up 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.740
 jump high lands makes a little 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.939
 hopper at the other jump program 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.189
 will then jump like the jump again 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.229
 what he does you catch this little one 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.939
 Hopser stands up for one or two 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.039
 seconds in this position then 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.450
 again with your use again 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:23.700
 to jump up again 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.770
 little hops make land stand 12 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.189
 seconds then wait up again 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.959
 jump 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.329
 the whole thing is for us to be here now 

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:31.950
 Do not shorten the cycle in short ds 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.139
 primarily trained but mainly still 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.880
 times the long of the delay stretch 

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:37.880
 shortening cycle further improved 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.719
 from the two higher jumps with 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.670
 break makes the total of two sets 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:54.539
 five minutes break and five each 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.670
 jump per set 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:58.530
 then the games will be the same 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.390
 executed as with the other program 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.759
 but with different sentences 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.560
 next , the two hurdles made 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.479
 jump normal that means as in the 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.090
 Other training started at level 3 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.679
 that means she jumps high lands makes 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.090
 a small bouncer and then again 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.370
 directly jump up again 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.040
 you make five repetitions per 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.700
 set two sets of five minutes each 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.700
 set break 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.950
 followed by the one-legged 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.510
 include jumps that already knows only 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.170
 this time again on your little hops 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.239
 between 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.030
 I'll make you out of it, too 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:47.379
 again five jumps per set three sets 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.379
 with five minutes break 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.320
 after that, the skater jumps as if on 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.330
 stage 2 only this time again with the 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.860
 little hops in between, too 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.320
 again five jumps per leg so 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:13.210
 a total of ten jumps per set thereof 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.210
 three sets with fifth set break 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.060
 the last exercise is the zigzag jump 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.160
 that is similar to the leap from 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.390
 Level 2 just stop with the linear 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.950
 component forward 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.050
 you will spend five hours again 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.910
 which means ten jumps per set 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.570
 two sets of five minutes each 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.570
 set break 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:53.060
 So that was the leap of rain 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:54.049
 Level 3, this is supposed to be four to eight 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.219
 Weeks lead out 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:56.870
 you can of course longer 

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:58.689
 depending on whether you already are 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.849
 sure with the spring feels and also 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:02.959
 continuously increasing experience 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:03.980
 after that follows now in connection 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.239
 then again the complete 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.799
 summary of the training program 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.689
 so that you can do it right after that 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:10.670
 can write and otherwise wish 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:13.389
 Thank you so much for the training 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.389
 Goodbye
