00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.480
 good and welcome to video number 24 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.460
 of transfiguration is finishing this 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.960
 round we go with a plate with a 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.000
 request that was made long ago and that 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.439
 have asked in several comments on this 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.450
 video we are going to assemble a version 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.890
 spartan of world of warcraft though 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.500
 little to do with the view of the movie 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.660
 of 300 this will be an alternative version 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.550
 of Spartan from which to draw 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.380
 ideas to do our own and that 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.110
 It has been done mainly with greens from 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.850
 low level we start with the bib and 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.620
 for this we will use the breastplate of the hand 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.059
 shattered a good green that 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.980
 we will find the patrols of the 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.500
 band of the burn or even as a temple 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.420
 dark every fan or the top jihad this we 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.250
 it will serve as the typical bronze breastplate 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.829
 articulated used in the archaic period 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.290
 by the Spartans for pants 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.270
 we have two options to choose the first 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.400
 for both factions following a little 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.980
 more the color line is the quixotes 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.630
 Cobalt spiked a created object 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.030
 with basic blacksmithing from 12 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.460
 cobalt bars and the second are the 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.049
 sun path thighs that you can only 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.939
 have the horde in combat against the 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.860
 novara in cross test in version 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:15.229
 heroic and that give it a touch of crimson 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.990
 extra this configuration still so 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.060
 we will give by lass 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.759
 following with the helmet we have other two 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.070
 options to choose the first is the helmet 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.720
 of blood flakes a green bowl that 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.700
 we can find the patrols of 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.710
 the dungeons of the burning crusade and 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.869
 that will serve us as the typical helmet with 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.420
 crest traversed so characteristic of 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.860
 this type of soldiers and the second the 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.990
 steel helmet vila the style of 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.909
 Corinthian much more identifying than 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.920
 this Greek army and that follows better 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.049
 the bronze colored line but maybe not 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.060
 as famous as the other let's leave 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:48.490
 for each faction one so that you see the 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.979
 difference now we pass the shoulder pads 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.530
 that like many others we must put some 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.119
 although they really did not carry any 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.399
 we will use for it the covers shoulders 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.649
 jane it back from the first 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:01.539
 Alice Kim bars with strength 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:03.280
 educate from or the nexus that follows a little 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:05.049
 the bronzes of the armor without highlighting 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.959
 a lot and that we can find with 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.280
 Luck also in the auction house 

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:10.720
 going to the boots since they are in 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.489
 an adaptation in the world version 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.950
 warcraft we do not know the typical 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:18.160
 Greek shin guards calls of measures 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.660
 but the cannabis gravels come back from 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.459
 the most erased the good even from 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.350
 how do they hold them hundreds of 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.510
 slaves to lay down week 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.490
 one of plates are quite ordinary and 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.830
 not the plate boots that normally 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.440
 we have in the game for hands 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.940
 We will use the gloves fist blood other 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.680
 can see from the dungeons and band 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.510
 high they put it you know that follows the 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.370
 transfiguration line and we can 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.830
 find in the auction house also 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.930
 and for the belt we will have to buy the 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.120
 singing blade belt that 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.920
 get more easily when buying it in 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.530
 the intendants of delegated justice 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.260
 cities plaque towns will give by 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.120
 few gold coins already ending only 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.770
 we have something left for the back 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.410
 which will have to get the big 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.690
 cloak of the soul ripper booty 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.090
 the dungeon in normal mode monastery 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.980
 scarlet in combat hire us the 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.930
 Heart-piercing of crimson souls 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.730
 as typical of the Spartan army 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.470
 it would be ready with the 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.630
 transfiguration so let's move on to 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.370
 weapons although it is well known that the 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.290
 Spartans used spear and shield 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.150
 we can only use weapon of 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.160
 up to two hands so our 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.810
 choice will be the drill that we can 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.490
 find the final heads of the 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.640
 bands of the class or in the house of 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.410
 auctions a simple and simple spear of 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.190
 same skin we also have the body of 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.660
 stone 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.330
 with the cane a little darker and 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.100
 also as I go fashion for the version 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.080
 of tanks we will obviously use the 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.210
 Conical dragon deflector marked by 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.250
 relic flames that we can acquire 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.770
 easily in the conservatives of 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.600
 relics in forged entrails and to it 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.060
 we will add the hand sword in this 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.460
 If the loot pit remorse 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.050
 scale in network 25 players and yes 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.570
 it is quite decidedly sticking to the use of 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.280
 300 movie and with this we will finish 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.260
 this transfiguration of spartan to 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.120
 plates or at least one version of them 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.800
 of the many there are if you have 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.780
 Any questions or requests from Japan comment 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.220
 something to write a tweet and you know that 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.960
 You can squeeze into the channel to be at 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.640
 so much of all these videos for the 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.980
 next we will return with a new round 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.790
 with a fabric greetings and see you in 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.790
 the next video
