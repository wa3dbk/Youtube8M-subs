00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.509
 for this we need a stipler 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:09.410
 pliers piece of wire 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.980
 burlap but also canisters with mining 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:16.910
 we will not shoot the old sackcloth 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.910
 no more time over 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:29.810
 we wind a tree trunk and a stapler 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:33.780
 attract to it was a carpenter 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:37.670
 the upper edge do not hammer here we will 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.670
 pour the work over in your pocket 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.970
 example we twist the wire do it 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.770
 gently three corners we bend to 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.770
 the animal did not hurt the axis 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.490

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.920
 fill in the inner pockets 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:47.159
 at the same time the smell of mining with diesel fuel 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.659
 selects the spirit of human presence 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.439
 prescribe burlap is not very long 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:55.720
 time is saved 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.450
 working out reduces the fluidity of diesel fuel 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.450
 leaves with a good smell smell of diesel fuel 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:04.539
 very persistent will be a long time with 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.259
 prilla puke the beast into the surrounding 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:08.610
 locality
