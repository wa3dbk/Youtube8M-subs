00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.740
 the american singer and grammy 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.780
 winner taylor swift and her 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.660
 perfect red lips are mine 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.519
 inspirations for this make-up taylor 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.580
 wears this look in the commercial for her 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:21.100
 first perfume walking stick the fragrance is 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.830
 a flowery fruity composition 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.050
 freesia apple blossoms and grades 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.420
 the heart notes are vanilla and hibiscus 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.289
 which are rounded off by amber and 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.690
 sandalwood 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.820
 I personally think the fragrance is very 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.100
 teen and cheerful as well 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.899
 taylor swift if you like it then 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.329
 you want make-up then this is 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:41.889
 tutorial just right I hope so 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.249
 do you like watching and at 

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:44.249
 reapplication 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.370
 for the primer namely one 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:53.170
 gold price colored cream eyeshadow by 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.479
 meidling I do that very special 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.070
 because they are well pigmented and they are 

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:57.789
 do not slip under the powder 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.469
 eye shadow 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:01.300
 I distribute the product on mine 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.699
 eyelid and also on the lower 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.560
 eyelash wreath the first eye shadow the 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:08.080
 I use now is this moldy 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.180
 vanilla tone of l'oreal with one 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.640
 I carry it on my flat brush 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.680
 Song on for a very saturated 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.119
 vaart duty I would like to recommend the 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.649
 product to press 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.649
 instead of the korup to move back and forth 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.890
 in the inner corner of the eye you can 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.890
 apply a little bit 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.899
 for the eyelid, namely a medium 

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:35.819
 gray-brown eyeshadow by patrice here 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.100
 says Gerner tip with the dark color 

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:40.289
 not on your cheek take a field 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.950
 Handkerchief containing it against the outside 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:43.469
 eye area 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.840
 if something falls down now 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:48.030
 social book well in any case, namely 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.950
 now a round fluffy brush and 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.409
 Now wear the brown eyeshadow in the 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.009
 lid fold on it gives a very nice 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.009
 shading 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.360
 very important not under the eye 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.920
 Forgot now I choose a bright one 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.229
 beige colored eyeshadow 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.869
 He only has very little shimmer but no 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.610
 glitter I now blinded the dark 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.830
 border of patrice eyeshadow and 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.140
 put so synonymous a highlight under 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.570
 my eyes brown animal has a rather 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.150
 smoky black line saying 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:24.160
 only very well blinded you take it 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.500
 best a very soft kajalstift 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.710
 and wear it close to the eyelashes 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.600
 on with a little brush or too 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.860
 a cotton swab you can draw the strokes 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.350
 now slightly blur 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.560
 this makes the lidstick much softer 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.600
 and flattering on the outside 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.170
 eye contour I draw the pen stroke after 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.700
 Outside 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.700
 that gives a short instant 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.560
 and again and not forget, however 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.510
 I did not have to cover the whole line here 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.730
 pull inward because that reduced 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.190
 the eye visually with something gel 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.050
 single parent now again because 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.810
 I really want it to be very black 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.180
 on the eyelashes is that helps afterwards 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.620
 if you want to glue the eyelashes otherwise 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.690
 sometimes you see the transition between 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.760
 the real and the false eyelashes 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.420
 I pull the gel easily on my own 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.400
 Gluing from eyelashes is definite 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.500
 a matter of taste but on the red 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.140
 Carpet is just a listen to theres 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.700
 look so I'm doing here now too 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.269
 a pair of tweezers goes all that much 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.190
 easier are the seesaw first 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:30.049
 Placed correctly, I press it with you 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.500
 Stick a nail with it, too 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.500
 live well 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.550
 and now to tales of their trademark 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.950
 pout 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.840
 so i love red lipstick me 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.330
 find him classic and just beautiful 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.980
 and suits every woman you just have to 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.980
 find the right tone 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.720
 patrick generally a cool red than 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.060
 First , I draw my lips contours 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.490
 after with a contour pencil of the should 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.950
 in the same tone or a tick darker 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.690
 its as an imaginary lipstick if 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.920
 your lips are not quite symmetrical 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.470
 you can cheat a bit here 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.910
 and make up for it 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.490
 for the lipstick I choose my now 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.910
 absolute favorite of giorgio right now 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.000
 armani 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.890
 but a drugstore also has this market 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.800
 just a beautiful texture and 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.810
 does not last forever on my teeth 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.940
 and hardly smeared I love him 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.260
 I'll just use one this time 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.340
 Make a lip brush with it really 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.340
 looks perfect 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.330
 At the end I always do 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.590
 concealer under my eyes 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.750
 I think that gives the perfect 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.860
 Graduation here is just important 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.860
 hide them very well 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.540
 on the cheeks trick Taylor one 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.820
 subtle tone of light to your skin 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.600
 post without being too quiet 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.420
 stands 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:55.010

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.010

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.300

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.170

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.750
