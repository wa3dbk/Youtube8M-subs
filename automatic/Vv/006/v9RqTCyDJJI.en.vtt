00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.970
 they have sex appeal and an unbelievable question may arise 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.449
 not the girls look at the shit 

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:15.549
 reset the old Stingray Bouvier 66 and the brand new C6 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:18.920
 that raises the question who pulls probably better in the women 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.679
 I found the theater rather better its first mountain sports joke 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.109
 with 4 he is under the hood is quite a lot has become I think 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.600
 It's more fun to drive, I just love it 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.410
 Friedenauer elegantly allowed 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.410
 but I just like the way and if not everyone on the internet 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.950
 to have the new Corvette c6 61 thousand euros 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.380
 414 gallop under her bonnet up to 300 Karin h 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.400
 Auer e 66 has 256 hp and is still 200 top of the classics costs Zacher 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.120
 Simply forget 44 thousand euros 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.270
 the IEC has plugged in money 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.070
 because the technology was not that good yet 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.240
 then you have to reckon with 20 25 meters 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.860
 at the Altenaer and the new seats in urban consumption at about 17 18 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.860
 Meter and percent over land wanted the 13 meters 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.430
 becomes a box of success for the woman 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.850
 when knife throwing the first sample when driving in the Corvette Stingray 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.420
 do 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.420
 how nice it is 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.050
 Reiner Methe 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.050
 continue working together a year ago 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.810
 No no no no 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:44.950
 we will try 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.950
 Reason to radiate, Rath earns a smooth one 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.310
 with own works 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.190
 thanks to a worldwide pandemic 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.680
 He stands for Christian Wegner in a glass jar every year 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.720
 from zero to one hundred in 3 4 seconds 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.890
 that's exactly her 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.890
 just because he has not won by mail yet 

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:13.729
 I think that we girls off 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:15.609
 Types of exhibits from no 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:18.649
 Hmm Hmm Hmm not he said 

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:22.679
 we accompany the Saarland soldiers themselves make quite normal 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:27.029
 the woman was born on 12 

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:28.989
 it's best to go through the acoustics 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.729
 the Sylvari with their pithy v8 sound is in a class of its own 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.849
 Cowell experts do not 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.079
 It is always easy that every ninth seems to be no longer so loud 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.469
 then we still hear we know 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:44.179
 to give individual care 

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:47.179
 but that must be true 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:48.920
 are essential 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.979
 Sometimes it sounds like the new version 

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:53.979
 a bit like one 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.519
 Depending on the speed of the year remain a bit intrusive 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.709
 but nowadays that's why he is a bit calmer 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.949
 you just use it so times 

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:07.829
 pleasantly quiet criticism 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:09.609
 now, "Grimm's words 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:12.609
 have picture is best with the c6 

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:16.950
 Until the love is more of something for oldtimer fans and hobby-screwdrivers 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.950
 who can also lend a hand 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:26.549
 the aging special appeal is fun to drive 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.839
 gets a bit more robust 

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:32.179
 and snom driving just has more so you have to do more 

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:36.739
 Focusing on the car is not as easy as driving the new one 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:37.659
 Corvette 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:40.659
 but it's just as much fun for that as well 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:44.999
 Volker Mester himself at the wheel 

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:47.999
 beautiful women and fast cars that belongs 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:51.440
 a mobile phone numbers 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.329
 with the Heumarkt no 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.169
 a cause is further 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:57.229
 we also had something of it
