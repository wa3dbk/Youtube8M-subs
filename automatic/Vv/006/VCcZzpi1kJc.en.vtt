00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
the tank here's the gauge both made by

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.979 
the tank here's the gauge both made by
Sun<00:00:43.190> Perl<00:00:43.489> I<00:00:43.809> ordered<00:00:44.809> them<00:00:44.930> from<00:00:45.640> amazon.com

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
Sun Perl I ordered them from amazon.com

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.340 
Sun Perl I ordered them from amazon.com
the<00:00:47.989> directions<00:00:48.500> are<00:00:49.479> not<00:00:50.479> the<00:00:50.629> greatest<00:00:51.079> I

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
the directions are not the greatest I

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.660 
the directions are not the greatest I
would<00:00:51.589> have<00:00:51.680> liked<00:00:51.830> a<00:00:51.920> little<00:00:52.009> more<00:00:52.129> detail<00:00:52.640> on

would have liked a little more detail on

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:59.380 
would have liked a little more detail on
them<00:00:52.970> since<00:00:53.509> this<00:00:53.659> is<00:00:53.839> all<00:00:53.989> new<00:00:54.140> to<00:00:54.290> me<00:00:55.479> but<00:00:58.390> gas

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
them since this is all new to me but gas

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.259 
them since this is all new to me but gas
tank<00:00:59.689> sits<00:00:59.930> like<00:01:00.110> this<00:01:00.640> here's<00:01:01.640> the<00:01:01.699> front<00:01:02.150> of

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
tank sits like this here's the front of

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:04.359 
tank sits like this here's the front of
the<00:01:02.360> tractors<00:01:02.839> that<00:01:03.049> way<00:01:03.229> and<00:01:04.009> I<00:01:04.100> looked<00:01:04.280> at

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
the tractors that way and I looked at

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:05.890 
the tractors that way and I looked at
one<00:01:04.489> of<00:01:04.519> the<00:01:04.640> other<00:01:04.759> cases<00:01:05.089> that<00:01:05.299> saw<00:01:05.689> is<00:01:05.750> the

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
one of the other cases that saw is the

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.420 
one of the other cases that saw is the
tank<00:01:06.140> in<00:01:06.350> it<00:01:06.409> and<00:01:06.530> I<00:01:06.560> think<00:01:06.619> I'm<00:01:06.890> gonna<00:01:07.009> install

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
tank in it and I think I'm gonna install

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.710 
tank in it and I think I'm gonna install
it<00:01:07.490> right<00:01:08.479> about<00:01:08.689> there<00:01:08.750> and<00:01:10.329> we'll<00:01:11.329> go<00:01:11.570> from

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
it right about there and we'll go from

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.160 
it right about there and we'll go from
there

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
there

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.940 
there
so<00:01:12.590> arty<00:01:14.439> okay<00:01:15.439> I<00:01:15.560> used<00:01:15.860> the<00:01:16.100> gasket<00:01:16.640> to<00:01:17.950> make

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
so arty okay I used the gasket to make

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.569 
so arty okay I used the gasket to make
my<00:01:19.130> circle<00:01:19.369> size<00:01:20.680> and<00:01:21.680> I<00:01:21.799> drew<00:01:22.009> my<00:01:22.159> circle

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:22.579 
my circle size and I drew my circle

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:23.740 
my circle size and I drew my circle
right<00:01:22.820> there<00:01:23.060> I<00:01:23.090> know<00:01:23.299> you<00:01:23.420> probably<00:01:23.600> can't

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750

of free handed it with the dremel yes I
should<00:01:38.060> have<00:01:38.150> used<00:01:38.330> a<00:01:38.450> hole<00:01:38.659> saw<00:01:38.900> I<00:01:39.260> just

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
should have used a hole saw I just

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.170 
should have used a hole saw I just
didn't<00:01:40.430> feel<00:01:40.520> like<00:01:40.610> going<00:01:40.760> out<00:01:40.850> to<00:01:41.000> the<00:01:41.090> garage

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
didn't feel like going out to the garage

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.860 
didn't feel like going out to the garage
to<00:01:41.450> get<00:01:41.570> it

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 
to get it

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.920 
to get it
so<00:01:42.549> no<00:01:43.549> I'm<00:01:44.060> just<00:01:44.180> gonna<00:01:44.330> have<00:01:44.510> to<00:01:44.540> follow<00:01:44.720> the

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
so no I'm just gonna have to follow the

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.649 
so no I'm just gonna have to follow the
directions<00:01:45.229> and<00:01:46.150> make<00:01:47.150> some<00:01:47.330> precise

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
directions and make some precise

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.770 
directions and make some precise
measurements<00:01:48.290> to<00:01:48.440> cut<00:01:48.650> the<00:01:48.799> float<00:01:49.100> and<00:01:49.780> adjust

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
measurements to cut the float and adjust

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.280 
measurements to cut the float and adjust
this<00:01:51.619> doohickey<00:01:51.950> and<00:01:52.720> then<00:01:53.720> mount<00:01:54.049> it<00:01:54.170> in

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
this doohickey and then mount it in

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.320 
this doohickey and then mount it in
there<00:01:54.440> with<00:01:54.530> the<00:01:54.560> gasket<00:01:54.799> I<00:01:55.070> don't<00:01:55.250> know<00:01:55.430> fine

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
there with the gasket I don't know fine

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.690 
there with the gasket I don't know fine
I<00:01:56.560> think<00:01:57.560> that<00:01:57.740> should<00:01:58.040> work<00:01:58.070> all<00:01:58.460> right<00:01:58.490> I

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
I think that should work all right I

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.160 
I think that should work all right I
don't<00:01:58.850> think<00:01:59.119> I'll<00:01:59.210> have<00:01:59.240> to<00:01:59.450> Permatex<00:01:59.960> that

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
don't think I'll have to Permatex that

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.510 
don't think I'll have to Permatex that
we'll<00:02:00.409> just<00:02:00.590> try<00:02:00.770> just<00:02:00.830> the<00:02:01.310> gasket<00:02:01.729> so<00:02:01.909> okay

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
we'll just try just the gasket so okay

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.440 
we'll just try just the gasket so okay
okay<00:02:04.520> I<00:02:04.549> pre-drilled<00:02:05.390> the<00:02:05.740> mounting<00:02:06.740> holes

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
okay I pre-drilled the mounting holes

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.059 
okay I pre-drilled the mounting holes
got<00:02:08.450> it<00:02:08.599> all<00:02:08.720> mounted<00:02:09.140> in<00:02:09.319> according<00:02:09.799> to<00:02:09.920> the

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
got it all mounted in according to the

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.399 
got it all mounted in according to the
directions<00:02:10.519> and<00:02:11.090> I'm<00:02:11.599> really<00:02:11.900> hoping<00:02:12.290> it

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:12.409 
directions and I'm really hoping it

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:14.199 
directions and I'm really hoping it

problem<00:02:34.740> is<00:02:35.840> but<00:02:36.840> it's<00:02:37.020> going<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.200> be<00:02:37.380> an

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
problem is but it's going to be an

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:59.360 
problem is but it's going to be an
adjustment<00:02:37.890> in<00:02:38.100> here<00:02:57.920> there<00:02:58.920> we<00:02:59.040> go

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
adjustment in here there we go

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.220 
adjustment in here there we go
see<00:03:00.000> if<00:03:00.060> I<00:03:00.150> push<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.510> float<00:03:00.720> down<00:03:00.930> it<00:03:01.080> does

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
see if I push the float down it does

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.370 
see if I push the float down it does
seem<00:03:01.410> to<00:03:01.500> be<00:03:01.590> working<00:03:02.930> I'm<00:03:03.930> gonna<00:03:04.080> drain<00:03:04.350> the

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
seem to be working I'm gonna drain the

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:10.850 
seem to be working I'm gonna drain the
water<00:03:04.620> out<00:03:04.980> and<00:03:07.760> take<00:03:08.760> this<00:03:08.940> out<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:09.860> maybe

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
water out and take this out and maybe

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.259 
water out and take this out and maybe
make<00:03:11.160> a<00:03:11.190> couple<00:03:11.459> of<00:03:11.640> adjustments<00:03:12.330> on<00:03:12.959> it<00:03:14.269> well

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
make a couple of adjustments on it well

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.259 
make a couple of adjustments on it well
I<00:03:15.540> did<00:03:16.080> get<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:16.590> Sun<00:03:17.130> pearl<00:03:17.459> thing<00:03:17.730> adjusted<00:03:18.239> a

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
I did get the Sun pearl thing adjusted a

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:19.490 
I did get the Sun pearl thing adjusted a
little<00:03:18.300> more<00:03:18.690> and<00:03:18.870> I<00:03:18.930> think<00:03:19.170> I'm<00:03:19.260> gonna<00:03:19.350> make

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
little more and I think I'm gonna make

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.050 
little more and I think I'm gonna make
the<00:03:19.650> final<00:03:19.830> adjustments<00:03:20.069> once<00:03:20.640> it's<00:03:20.910> hooked

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
the final adjustments once it's hooked

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.309 
the final adjustments once it's hooked
up<00:03:21.300> it's<00:03:21.480> easy<00:03:21.690> to<00:03:21.840> get<00:03:21.989> to<00:03:22.220> but<00:03:23.220> I<00:03:23.280> noticed

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
up it's easy to get to but I noticed

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.220 
up it's easy to get to but I noticed
amperage<00:03:25.319> makes<00:03:25.920> a<00:03:26.040> big<00:03:26.250> difference<00:03:26.730> on

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
amperage makes a big difference on

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.930 
amperage makes a big difference on
fine-tuning<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.950> gauge<00:03:30.170> so<00:03:31.400> once<00:03:32.400> we<00:03:32.610> get<00:03:32.760> the

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
fine-tuning the gauge so once we get the

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.960 
fine-tuning the gauge so once we get the
tank<00:03:33.150> in<00:03:33.420> which<00:03:33.540> I<00:03:34.340> probably<00:03:35.340> will<00:03:35.640> put<00:03:35.880> in

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
tank in which I probably will put in

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.400 
tank in which I probably will put in
tomorrow<00:03:36.269> because<00:03:36.570> I'm<00:03:36.660> I<00:03:36.900> don't<00:03:37.170> have<00:03:37.290> the

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
tomorrow because I'm I don't have the

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.190 
tomorrow because I'm I don't have the
new<00:03:37.560> fuel<00:03:37.799> line<00:03:38.010> for<00:03:38.310> it<00:03:38.400> yet<00:03:38.579> so<00:03:38.970> what<00:03:39.810> got<00:03:40.049> the

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
new fuel line for it yet so what got the

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.270 
new fuel line for it yet so what got the
axle<00:03:40.590> on<00:03:40.739> it<00:03:40.980> looks<00:03:41.160> good<00:03:42.590> front<00:03:43.590> axles<00:03:43.980> on<00:03:44.100> I

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
axle on it looks good front axles on I

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.280 
axle on it looks good front axles on I
only<00:03:44.400> have<00:03:44.640> it<00:03:44.670> held<00:03:45.000> in<00:03:45.180> with<00:03:45.420> the<00:03:45.840> spindles

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
only have it held in with the spindles

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.830 
only have it held in with the spindles
held<00:03:46.500> in<00:03:46.650> with<00:03:46.970> nails<00:03:47.970> right<00:03:48.239> now<00:03:48.299> because<00:03:48.630> I

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
held in with nails right now because I

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.610 
held in with nails right now because I
did<00:03:49.019> ordered<00:03:50.930> what<00:03:51.930> they<00:03:52.049> call<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.350> poor

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
did ordered what they call the poor

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.580 
did ordered what they call the poor
man's<00:03:52.859> power<00:03:53.280> steering<00:03:54.230> it's<00:03:55.230> just<00:03:55.410> a<00:03:55.500> little

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
man's power steering it's just a little

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.270 
man's power steering it's just a little
modification<00:03:55.950> where<00:03:56.549> you<00:03:56.609> put<00:03:57.560> a<00:03:58.560> bearing

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
modification where you put a bearing

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.240 
modification where you put a bearing
between<00:03:59.430> two<00:03:59.820> washers<00:04:00.329> right<00:04:01.049> here<00:04:01.440> and

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
between two washers right here and

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.580 
between two washers right here and
supposedly<00:04:02.880> it's<00:04:03.090> supposed<00:04:03.150> to<00:04:03.450> help<00:04:04.440> with

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
supposedly it's supposed to help with

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:05.870 
supposedly it's supposed to help with
the<00:04:04.890> steering<00:04:05.160> when<00:04:05.400> you<00:04:05.489> have<00:04:05.609> a<00:04:05.640> lot<00:04:05.790> of

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
the steering when you have a lot of

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.449 
the steering when you have a lot of
weight<00:04:06.000> in<00:04:06.120> the<00:04:06.180> front<00:04:06.390> end<00:04:06.570> so<00:04:06.859> we<00:04:07.859> will<00:04:08.010> see<00:04:08.250> I

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
weight in the front end so we will see I

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:09.740 
weight in the front end so we will see I
don't<00:04:08.730> know<00:04:08.820> when<00:04:08.970> that's<00:04:09.150> going<00:04:09.359> to<00:04:09.420> arrive<00:04:09.720> I

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
don't know when that's going to arrive I

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.180 
don't know when that's going to arrive I
ordered<00:04:10.170> it<00:04:10.290> off<00:04:10.410> the<00:04:10.590> Internet

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
ordered it off the Internet

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.729 
ordered it off the Internet
so<00:04:11.730> and<00:04:12.480> also<00:04:12.750> the<00:04:12.900> vinyl<00:04:13.200> sticker<00:04:13.470> for<00:04:13.680> the

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
so and also the vinyl sticker for the

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:14.870 
so and also the vinyl sticker for the
dash<00:04:13.980> hasn't<00:04:14.430> come<00:04:14.579> yet

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
dash hasn't come yet

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.690 
dash hasn't come yet
so<00:04:15.570> that<00:04:15.870> should<00:04:16.079> be<00:04:16.109> here<00:04:16.549> relatively<00:04:17.549> soon

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
so that should be here relatively soon

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.550 
so that should be here relatively soon
and

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
and

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.000 
and
other<00:04:20.519> no<00:04:20.730> it's<00:04:20.940> starting<00:04:21.830> starting<00:04:22.830> to<00:04:22.890> come

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
other no it's starting starting to come
