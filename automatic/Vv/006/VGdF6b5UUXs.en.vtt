00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
we can take this and zoom in and that's

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.660 
we can take this and zoom in and that's
how<00:01:17.549> simple<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.530> so<00:01:19.530> for<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:20.070> I'll<00:01:20.430> just

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
how simple it is so for this I'll just

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.090 
how simple it is so for this I'll just
zoom<00:01:21.090> in<00:01:21.420> right<00:01:21.780> on<00:01:21.840> zoom<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.500> just<00:01:22.799> because

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
zoom in right on zoom in just because

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.890 
zoom in right on zoom in just because
it's<00:01:24.060> kind<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.270> funny<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:26.090> that's<00:01:27.090> all<00:01:27.540> there

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
it's kind of funny and that's all there

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.600 
it's kind of funny and that's all there
is<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.320> now<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.680> can<00:01:28.950> see<00:01:29.130> this<00:01:29.310> little

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
is to it now you can see this little

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.830 
is to it now you can see this little
blue<00:01:30.090> thing<00:01:30.570> here<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.850> you<00:01:32.850> can<00:01:33.030> move<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.509> if

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
blue thing here and you can move this if

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.890 
blue thing here and you can move this if
you<00:01:33.960> want<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:35.220> start<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.549> little<00:01:35.729> later<00:01:35.900> you

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
you want it to start a little later you

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.230 
you want it to start a little later you
can<00:01:37.079> also<00:01:38.060> bring<00:01:39.060> this<00:01:39.299> bar<00:01:39.570> down<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:41.240> go

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
can also bring this bar down and go

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.660 
can also bring this bar down and go
ahead<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.780> tell<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.530> how<00:01:43.829> long<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.369> want<00:01:44.610> it

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
ahead and tell it how long you want it

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.980 
ahead and tell it how long you want it
to<00:01:45.380> zoom<00:01:46.380> in<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:47.189> right<00:01:47.970> now<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.360> will<00:01:48.479> take<00:01:48.509> one

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
to zoom in so right now it will take one

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.859 
to zoom in so right now it will take one
second<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.619> go<00:01:49.920> from<00:01:50.189> full<00:01:50.490> screen<00:01:50.909> all<00:01:51.420> the

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
second to go from full screen all the

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.330 
second to go from full screen all the
way<00:01:51.960> in<00:01:52.170> there<00:01:52.380> but<00:01:52.619> if<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:52.799> want<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.159> take

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
way in there but if I want it to take

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.999 
way in there but if I want it to take
longer<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:54.119> could<00:01:54.720> make<00:01:54.899> it<00:01:54.930> up<00:01:55.079> as<00:01:55.439> much<00:01:55.500> as

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
longer I could make it up as much as

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.940 
longer I could make it up as much as
five<00:01:56.549> seconds<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.719> go<00:01:57.869> from<00:01:57.899> full<00:01:58.350> screen<00:01:58.710> all

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
five seconds to go from full screen all

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.499 
five seconds to go from full screen all
the<00:01:59.460> way<00:01:59.579> in<00:01:59.850> to<00:02:00.540> this<00:02:00.689> area<00:02:01.020> here<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:02.420> you<00:02:03.420> can

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
the way in to this area here and you can

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.980 
the way in to this area here and you can
see<00:02:03.719> that<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:04.170> makes<00:02:04.500> this<00:02:04.829> longer<00:02:05.310> also<00:02:05.990> then

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
see that it makes this longer also then

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.830 
see that it makes this longer also then
to<00:02:07.590> zoom<00:02:07.979> out<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.429> just<00:02:08.729> do<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.030> same<00:02:09.300> process

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
to zoom out you just do the same process

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.320 
to zoom out you just do the same process
in<00:02:10.110> Reverse<00:02:10.520> so<00:02:11.520> let<00:02:11.700> me<00:02:11.730> position<00:02:12.209> my

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
in Reverse so let me position my

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.320 
in Reverse so let me position my
playhead<00:02:12.840> right

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
playhead right

exactly<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:34.450> percentage<00:02:34.840> and<00:02:35.340> it<00:02:36.340> will<00:02:36.490> make

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
exactly the percentage and it will make

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.580 
exactly the percentage and it will make
it<00:02:37.300> just<00:02:37.570> like<00:02:37.690> that<00:02:37.750> every<00:02:38.170> time<00:02:38.200> that's

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
it just like that every time that's

found that very useful to be able to use
the<00:02:45.910> exact<00:02:46.240> percentage<00:02:47.550> all<00:02:48.550> right<00:02:48.820> so<00:02:49.090> let's

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
the exact percentage all right so let's

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.199 
the exact percentage all right so let's
head<00:02:49.540> on<00:02:49.600> over<00:02:49.990> to<00:02:50.320> figure<00:02:51.130> out<00:02:51.310> how<00:02:51.910> to<00:02:51.970> add

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
head on over to figure out how to add

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.980
