all the time to wear that I just wear
one<00:00:28.710> pair<00:00:29.039> anymore<00:00:30.800> it<00:00:31.800> just<00:00:32.040> makes<00:00:32.250> them<00:00:32.399> look

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
one pair anymore it just makes them look

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.200 
one pair anymore it just makes them look
more<00:00:32.610> dramatic<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.540> guess<00:00:34.610> okay<00:00:35.610> so<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.790> got<00:00:36.000> two

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
more dramatic I guess okay so I got two

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.930 
more dramatic I guess okay so I got two
random<00:00:38.030> two<00:00:39.030> random<00:00:39.510> pairs<00:00:40.489> one<00:00:41.489> looks<00:00:41.730> like

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
random two random pairs one looks like

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.500

this and one looks like that there
really<00:00:45.719> is<00:00:45.960> no<00:00:46.289> right<00:00:46.590> or<00:00:46.649> wrong<00:00:46.829> way<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.430> pick

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
really is no right or wrong way to pick

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.850 
really is no right or wrong way to pick
which<00:00:48.480> lashes<00:00:48.989> go<00:00:49.170> together<00:00:49.350> it's<00:00:49.770> really

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
from being new and that's pretty much it

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.289

you<00:02:09.349> just<00:02:09.590> line<00:02:10.069> them<00:02:10.280> up<00:02:10.399> and<00:02:10.640> stick<00:02:10.970> them<00:02:11.150> on

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:11.299 
you just line them up and stick them on

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:18.390 
you just line them up and stick them on
top<00:02:11.599> of<00:02:12.380> each<00:02:12.530> other<00:02:13.900> and<00:02:15.040> now<00:02:16.040> you<00:02:16.099> have<00:02:16.750> one

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
top of each other and now you have one

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.780 
top of each other and now you have one
flash<00:02:19.400> and<00:02:19.790> do<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:20.180> same<00:02:20.420> with<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:21.640> do<00:02:22.640> the

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
flash and do the same with the do the

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.539 
flash and do the same with the do the

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
same with the other one and usually I do

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:27.460 
same with the other one and usually I do
this<00:02:25.790> because<00:02:26.239> once<00:02:26.599> I've<00:02:26.810> stacked<00:02:27.200> two

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
to reuse them the exact same way I'm not

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:34.390 
to reuse them the exact same way I'm not
going<00:02:33.200> to<00:02:33.260> take<00:02:33.560> them<00:02:33.739> apart<00:02:33.860> and<00:02:34.160> use<00:02:34.250> them

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
going to take them apart and use them

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.830

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
the end if there's any sometimes there's

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.330 
the end if there's any sometimes there's
none<00:02:56.590> you're<00:02:57.590> going<00:02:57.739> to<00:02:57.799> want<00:02:58.010> to<00:02:58.069> take<00:02:58.280> some

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.559 
and just cut the actual they're both
together<00:03:07.220> so<00:03:07.730> they'll<00:03:07.940> both<00:03:08.120> go<00:03:08.389> the<00:03:08.540> same

will dry clear course and what I like to
do<00:04:14.900> is<00:04:15.140> get<00:04:15.320> tweezers<00:04:16.239> because<00:04:17.239> it's<00:04:17.390> just

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
do is get tweezers because it's just

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.640 
do is get tweezers because it's just
easier<00:04:19.150> the<00:04:20.150> most<00:04:20.450> important<00:04:21.109> part<00:04:21.410> of

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
easier the most important part of

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.340 
easier the most important part of
applying<00:04:22.460> lashes<00:04:22.700> is<00:04:23.210> letting<00:04:23.660> the<00:04:23.780> glue<00:04:24.020> dry

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
applying lashes is letting the glue dry

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.850 
applying lashes is letting the glue dry
at<00:04:24.680> least<00:04:24.980> 30<00:04:25.430> seconds<00:04:26.000> before<00:04:26.930> you<00:04:27.320> apply

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
at least 30 seconds before you apply

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.520 
at least 30 seconds before you apply
them<00:04:28.100> it<00:04:28.430> just<00:04:29.180> makes<00:04:29.420> it<00:04:29.540> easier<00:04:29.930> so<00:04:30.230> when<00:04:30.410> you

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
them it just makes it easier so when you

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.070 
them it just makes it easier so when you
actually<00:04:31.010> attach<00:04:31.100> them<00:04:31.610> they're<00:04:31.850> not<00:04:32.080> it's

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
actually attach them they're not it's

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.520 
actually attach them they're not it's
not<00:04:33.410> all<00:04:33.590> moving<00:04:34.010> around<00:04:34.130> it'll<00:04:34.580> stick<00:04:35.530> the

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
not all moving around it'll stick the

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.630 
not all moving around it'll stick the
first<00:04:36.800> time<00:04:38.320> so<00:04:39.320> let<00:04:39.590> it<00:04:39.710> dry<00:04:39.950> at<00:04:40.130> least<00:04:40.280> about

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.640

first time so let it dry at least about
30<00:04:40.910> seconds<00:04:41.620> least<00:04:42.620> until<00:04:42.980> it's<00:04:43.100> tacky<00:04:43.490> I<00:04:46.720> hope

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
30 seconds least until it's tacky I hope

cult<00:07:00.490> to<00:07:00.820> them<00:07:01.000> not<00:07:01.660> really<00:07:02.020> getting<00:07:02.350> the<00:07:02.470> fake

the<00:07:11.280> bases<00:07:12.280> off<00:07:14.010> and<00:07:15.010> then<00:07:15.220> I'll<00:07:15.460> stick<00:07:16.150> them

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:16.270
