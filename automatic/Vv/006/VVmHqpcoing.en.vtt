underwater I was breathing underwater I

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.430 
underwater I was breathing underwater I
was<00:00:38.550> breathing<00:00:38.820> water<00:00:39.180> into<00:00:39.600> my<00:00:39.629> lungs<00:00:39.960> and

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
was breathing water into my lungs and

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.910 
was breathing water into my lungs and

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
then breathing it out and it burned like

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.650 
then breathing it out and it burned like
 because<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:44.910> was<00:00:45.030> in<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.180> swimming<00:00:45.539> pool

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
 because I was in a swimming pool

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.330 
 because I was in a swimming pool
and<00:00:45.960> there's<00:00:46.110> chlorine<00:00:46.469> in<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.190> could

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
and there's chlorine in it and I could

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.610 
and there's chlorine in it and I could
heal<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.879> chlorine<00:00:48.360> like<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.780> toxin<00:00:49.440> like

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.069 
heal the chlorine like the toxin like
that<00:00:49.829> just<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.700> burning<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.300> burned<00:00:51.629> because

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
that just the burning it burned because

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.350 
that just the burning it burned because
the<00:00:52.440> one<00:00:52.949> because<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:53.579> think<00:00:53.640> because<00:00:53.910> my<00:00:54.120> lungs

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
the one because I think because my lungs

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.310 
the one because I think because my lungs
haven't<00:00:54.750> been<00:00:54.840> taken<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.140> lot<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.289> water<00:00:55.559> in<00:00:55.739> so

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
haven't been taken a lot of water in so

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.139 
haven't been taken a lot of water in so
fluid<00:00:58.320> in<00:00:58.410> general<00:00:58.829> was<00:00:58.980> like<00:00:59.160> new<00:00:59.370> for<00:00:59.699> it<00:00:59.850> but

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
fluid in general was like new for it but

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.060 
fluid in general was like new for it but
the<00:01:00.270> clothes<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.750> chlorine<00:01:01.199> burning<00:01:01.949> so

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
the clothes the chlorine burning so

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.390 
the clothes the chlorine burning so
I<00:01:02.100> started<00:01:02.370> thinking<00:01:03.680> our<00:01:04.680> lungs<00:01:05.010> are<00:01:05.220> built

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
I started thinking our lungs are built

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.660 
I started thinking our lungs are built
to<00:01:05.489> breathe<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:05.850> salt<00:01:06.180> water<00:01:07.430> salt<00:01:08.430> like<00:01:08.640> a

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
to breathe in salt water salt like a

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.240 
to breathe in salt water salt like a
saline<00:01:11.150> I'm<00:01:12.260> guarantee<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.650> hundred

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
saline I'm guarantee it a hundred

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.160 
saline I'm guarantee it a hundred
percent<00:01:14.340> positive<00:01:14.760> so<00:01:15.540> what<00:01:15.659> was<00:01:15.750> having<00:01:15.990> as<00:01:16.080> I

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
percent positive so what was having as I

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.960 
percent positive so what was having as I
breathe<00:01:16.439> in<00:01:16.500> this<00:01:16.740> water<00:01:17.040> into<00:01:17.460> my<00:01:17.549> lungs<00:01:17.759> I

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.100 
in this chlorine in the swimming pool in
this<00:01:25.439> hot<00:01:25.619> tub<00:01:26.030> that<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.240> then<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.420> come<00:01:27.900> up

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
this hot tub that and then I come up

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.760 
this hot tub that and then I come up
above<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.979> water<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:30.110> breathe<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.259> out<00:01:31.380> as<00:01:31.650> I

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
above the water and breathe it out as I

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.649 
above the water and breathe it out as I
came<00:01:31.950> out<00:01:32.100> my<00:01:32.220> brios<00:01:32.729> water<00:01:33.150> up<00:01:33.360> my<00:01:33.390> nose<00:01:33.509> and

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
came out my brios water up my nose and

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.200 
came out my brios water up my nose and
then<00:01:34.049> breathe<00:01:34.079> air<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.490> was<00:01:35.579> cool<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.909> was

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
then breathe air and it was cool it was

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.030 
then breathe air and it was cool it was
like<00:01:36.360> but<00:01:36.659> if<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.869> lungs<00:01:37.079> expecting<00:01:37.680> one<00:01:37.920> it

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
like but if the lungs expecting one it

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.580 
like but if the lungs expecting one it
gets<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.369> other<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.820> like<00:01:40.340> Quivers<00:01:42.500> but<00:01:43.500> then

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
gets the other it like Quivers but then

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.810 
gets the other it like Quivers but then
what<00:01:43.710> would<00:01:43.799> happen<00:01:44.070> was<00:01:44.189> i<00:01:44.220> every<00:01:44.610> time<00:01:44.640> i

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
what would happen was i every time i

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.749 
what would happen was i every time i
would<00:01:44.939> go<00:01:45.090> underwater<00:01:45.890> submerge<00:01:46.890> my<00:01:47.460> body

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
would go underwater submerge my body

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.179 
would go underwater submerge my body
would<00:01:48.060> be<00:01:48.320> more<00:01:49.320> likely<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.770> breathe<00:01:50.009> in<00:01:50.130> the

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
would be more likely to breathe in the

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.800 
would be more likely to breathe in the
water<00:01:50.430> like<00:01:50.610> my<00:01:50.759> nose<00:01:50.820> which<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:51.270> i<00:01:51.390> feel<00:01:51.659> it

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
water like my nose which is i feel it

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.359 
water like my nose which is i feel it
open<00:01:52.079> like<00:01:52.200> in<00:01:52.439> part<00:01:52.680> way<00:01:52.799> down<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.159> it's<00:01:53.250> like

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
open like in part way down and it's like

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.090 
open like in part way down and it's like
a<00:01:53.399> vacuum<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:54.149> draw<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.720> in<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.680> doesn't<00:01:56.009> like

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
a vacuum you draw it in it doesn't like

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.249 
a vacuum you draw it in it doesn't like
go<00:01:56.340> in<00:01:56.579> without<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:57.030> doing<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.780> can<00:01:57.960> draw

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
go in without you doing it you can draw

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.800 
go in without you doing it you can draw
it<00:01:58.290> in<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.829> then<00:01:59.820> i<00:02:01.340> found<00:02:02.340> um<00:02:02.670> hi<00:02:03.299> Maddie

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
it in and then i found um hi Maddie

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:16.580 
it in and then i found um hi Maddie
Hydra

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.250 

there's<00:02:17.590> a<00:02:17.680> gland<00:02:19.560> in<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.920> back<00:02:21.130> year<00:02:21.370> throat

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
there's a gland in the back year throat

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:34.199 
there's a gland in the back year throat
um<00:02:28.530> when<00:02:29.530> you<00:02:29.620> breathe<00:02:29.980> in<00:02:30.160> water<00:02:31.920> it<00:02:33.209> empties

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
um when you breathe in water it empties

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.520 
um when you breathe in water it empties
the<00:02:34.240> water<00:02:35.070> into<00:02:36.070> this<00:02:36.310> gland<00:02:36.670> and<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.530> glands

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
the water into this gland and the glands

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.640 
the water into this gland and the glands
like<00:02:38.770> up<00:02:38.980> like<00:02:39.880> a<00:02:39.910> tube<00:02:40.300> that<00:02:40.570> fills<00:02:40.990> up<00:02:41.290> like<00:02:41.530> I

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
like up like a tube that fills up like I

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.020 
like up like a tube that fills up like I
felt<00:02:42.160> it<00:02:42.400> slowly<00:02:43.360> filling<00:02:43.780> up<00:02:44.050> with<00:02:44.170> water<00:02:44.230> and

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
felt it slowly filling up with water and

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.360 
felt it slowly filling up with water and
then<00:02:46.030> it<00:02:46.270> got<00:02:46.360> to<00:02:46.540> a<00:02:46.569> point<00:02:46.600> and<00:02:47.050> it<00:02:47.380> dumped<00:02:48.040> the

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
then it got to a point and it dumped the

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.390 
then it got to a point and it dumped the
water<00:02:48.840> maybe<00:02:49.840> four<00:02:50.170> into<00:02:50.709> my<00:02:50.800> stomach<00:02:53.250> it<00:02:54.250> was

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
water maybe four into my stomach it was

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.949 
water maybe four into my stomach it was
like<00:02:54.580> swallowing<00:02:55.150> but<00:02:55.330> it<00:02:55.450> was<00:02:55.600> a<00:02:55.630> different

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
like swallowing but it was a different

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.979 
like swallowing but it was a different
gland<00:02:56.620> than<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:57.010> throat<00:02:57.280> it<00:02:57.430> was<00:02:57.519> like<00:02:57.989> above

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
gland than the throat it was like above

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.530 
gland than the throat it was like above
and<00:02:59.140> behind<00:02:59.230> the<00:02:59.500> throat<00:03:01.860> um<00:03:03.300> and<00:03:04.300> that's

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
and behind the throat um and that's

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.580 
and behind the throat um and that's
handy<00:03:05.019> and<00:03:05.200> then<00:03:05.739> I<00:03:05.769> was<00:03:05.920> thinking<00:03:07.500> okay<00:03:08.500> when

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
handy and then I was thinking okay when

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.590 
handy and then I was thinking okay when
you<00:03:08.650> take<00:03:08.830> water<00:03:09.130> in<00:03:09.400> and<00:03:09.670> you<00:03:10.060> breathe<00:03:10.300> it<00:03:10.450> out

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
you take water in and you breathe it out

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.220 
you take water in and you breathe it out
I<00:03:12.420> think<00:03:13.420> you're<00:03:13.510> producing<00:03:13.690> a<00:03:13.959> lot<00:03:14.110> of

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
I think you're producing a lot of

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.370 
I think you're producing a lot of
methane<00:03:14.620> because<00:03:15.570> of<00:03:16.570> all<00:03:16.690> the<00:03:16.780> hydrogen<00:03:17.110> and

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
methane because of all the hydrogen and

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.720 
methane because of all the hydrogen and
water<00:03:17.530> look<00:03:17.980> there's<00:03:18.130> not<00:03:18.280> i<00:03:18.310> mean<00:03:18.550> this

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
water look there's not i mean this

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.070 
water look there's not i mean this
hydrogen<00:03:19.060> in<00:03:19.239> the<00:03:19.269> air<00:03:19.450> there's<00:03:19.690> not<00:03:19.810> a<00:03:19.840> lot<00:03:20.050> of

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
hydrogen in the air there's not a lot of

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.390 
hydrogen in the air there's not a lot of
hydrogen<00:03:20.590> in<00:03:20.680> the<00:03:20.709> air<00:03:20.890> there's<00:03:21.100> like<00:03:21.220> some

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
hydrogen in the air there's like some

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.340 
hydrogen in the air there's like some
hydrogen<00:03:21.760> in<00:03:21.970> the<00:03:22.060> air<00:03:22.180> so<00:03:22.959> you've<00:03:23.079> always

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
hydrogen in the air so you've always

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.870 
hydrogen in the air so you've always
producing<00:03:23.769> some<00:03:23.980> methane<00:03:24.190> but<00:03:24.489> in<00:03:24.579> the<00:03:24.640> water

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
producing some methane but in the water

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.340 
producing some methane but in the water
I<00:03:25.000> think<00:03:25.269> you<00:03:25.360> produce<00:03:25.540> a<00:03:25.630> lot<00:03:25.870> of<00:03:25.900> methane<00:03:26.320> a

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
I think you produce a lot of methane a

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:27.780 
I think you produce a lot of methane a
little<00:03:26.680> bit<00:03:26.799> of<00:03:26.860> carbon<00:03:27.100> dioxide<00:03:27.130> when<00:03:27.670> you

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
little bit of carbon dioxide when you

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.940 
little bit of carbon dioxide when you
breathe<00:03:27.970> out<00:03:29.970> um<00:03:30.970> I<00:03:31.930> don't<00:03:32.049> suggest<00:03:32.410> you<00:03:32.709> try

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
breathe out um I don't suggest you try

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.580 
breathe out um I don't suggest you try
it<00:03:33.010> I<00:03:33.280> mean<00:03:33.430> anyone<00:03:33.790> can<00:03:34.120> try<00:03:34.780> it<00:03:34.840> you<00:03:35.560> might

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
it I mean anyone can try it you might

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.910 
it I mean anyone can try it you might
cough<00:03:36.010> I<00:03:36.400> was<00:03:37.030> just<00:03:37.209> so<00:03:37.870> relaxed<00:03:38.530> so<00:03:38.680> that<00:03:38.709> I

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
cough I was just so relaxed so that I

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.380 
cough I was just so relaxed so that I
was<00:03:39.070> able<00:03:39.220> to<00:03:39.370> because<00:03:39.700> I<00:03:39.790> feel<00:03:40.030> the<00:03:40.150> cough

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
was able to because I feel the cough

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.850 
was able to because I feel the cough
like<00:03:40.630> my<00:03:40.750> body<00:03:40.930> would<00:03:41.110> wanna<00:03:41.320> cough<00:03:41.560> but<00:03:41.829> I

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
like my body would wanna cough but I

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.699 
like my body would wanna cough but I
would<00:03:42.070> just<00:03:42.310> hold<00:03:43.120> the<00:03:43.390> water<00:03:43.600> and<00:03:45.570> let<00:03:46.570> it

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
would just hold the water and let it

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.699 
would just hold the water and let it
accumulate<00:03:47.709> and<00:03:48.220> swallow<00:03:48.790> it<00:03:49.440> because<00:03:50.440> it<00:03:50.680> was

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
accumulate and swallow it because it was

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:56.009 
accumulate and swallow it because it was
like<00:03:53.850> you<00:03:54.850> know<00:03:54.940> the<00:03:55.030> body<00:03:55.239> is<00:03:55.390> very<00:03:55.660> well

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
like you know the body is very well

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:57.569 
like you know the body is very well
maintained<00:03:56.410> so<00:03:56.799> ya<00:03:57.070> mean<00:03:57.220> we're<00:03:57.370> definitely

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
maintained so ya mean we're definitely

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:59.160 
maintained so ya mean we're definitely
our<00:03:58.000> lungs<00:03:58.209> are<00:03:58.390> built<00:03:58.570> to<00:03:58.660> breathe<00:03:58.840> in<00:03:58.989> air

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
our lungs are built to breathe in air

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.920 
our lungs are built to breathe in air
and<00:03:59.350> water<00:03:59.650> it's<00:04:00.450> quite<00:04:01.450> a<00:04:01.480> revelation<00:04:01.630> I'm

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
and water it's quite a revelation I'm

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
and water it's quite a revelation I'm
looking<00:04:02.140> forward<00:04:02.320> to<00:04:02.440> getting<00:04:02.500> to<00:04:02.680> the<00:04:02.769> beach

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
looking forward to getting to the beach

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.920 
looking forward to getting to the beach
and<00:04:04.650> practicing<00:04:05.650> this<00:04:05.739> in<00:04:05.920> the<00:04:06.010> ocean<00:04:06.400> or<00:04:06.930> but

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
and practicing this in the ocean or but

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
and practicing this in the ocean or but
I<00:04:07.989> was<00:04:08.079> thinking<00:04:08.320> maybe<00:04:08.410> I<00:04:08.560> could<00:04:08.590> just<00:04:08.739> like

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
I was thinking maybe I could just like

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.160 
I was thinking maybe I could just like
make<00:04:09.310> some<00:04:09.549> salt<00:04:09.790> water<00:04:10.000> here<00:04:10.420> and<00:04:10.690> breathe<00:04:10.989> it

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
make some salt water here and breathe it

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.640 
make some salt water here and breathe it
in<00:04:11.230> a<00:04:11.380> little<00:04:11.470> bit<00:04:12.900> it<00:04:13.900> feels<00:04:14.200> really<00:04:14.500> good

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
in a little bit it feels really good

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.670 
in a little bit it feels really good
like<00:04:15.190> once<00:04:16.000> I<00:04:16.120> started<00:04:16.359> doing<00:04:16.690> it<00:04:16.840> I<00:04:17.019> wanted<00:04:17.590> to

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
like once I started doing it I wanted to

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.370 
like once I started doing it I wanted to
keep<00:04:17.799> doing<00:04:18.190> it<00:04:18.370> it<00:04:18.579> felt<00:04:18.880> really<00:04:19.000> good<00:04:19.750> really

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
keep doing it it felt really good really

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.800 
keep doing it it felt really good really
good<00:04:20.620> in<00:04:20.950> ones<00:04:21.190> but<00:04:21.400> that<00:04:21.880> chlorine<00:04:22.270> was<00:04:22.570> like

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
good in ones but that chlorine was like

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.270 
good in ones but that chlorine was like
ah<00:04:24.210> it<00:04:25.210> was<00:04:25.360> kind<00:04:25.630> of<00:04:25.690> like<00:04:25.840> being<00:04:26.710> thirsty<00:04:26.979> and

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
ah it was kind of like being thirsty and

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.390 
ah it was kind of like being thirsty and
drinking<00:04:27.640> chlorinated

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
drinking chlorinated
