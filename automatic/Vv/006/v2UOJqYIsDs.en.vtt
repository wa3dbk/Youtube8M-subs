00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.110 
let's check out you guys see we have the
actual<00:00:34.590> module<00:00:34.800> itself<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.579> says<00:00:35.730> Allah<00:00:35.910> power

actual module itself it says Allah power
right<00:00:36.360> here<00:00:36.660> this<00:00:37.200> is<00:00:37.350> not<00:00:37.530> actually<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.860> button

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
right here this is not actually a button

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.709 
right here this is not actually a button
but<00:00:38.280> it's<00:00:38.399> more<00:00:38.579> just<00:00:38.879> for<00:00:39.180> design<00:00:39.480> for

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
but it's more just for design for

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.660 
but it's more just for design for
aesthetics<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.260> at<00:00:40.950> an<00:00:41.040> angle<00:00:41.340> actually<00:00:41.460> you

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
can kind of look at it and it looks kind

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.510

do that on a table but you could see

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.950 
do that on a table but you could see
here<00:00:59.039> with<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.250> LED<00:00:59.550> lights<00:00:59.820> I'm<00:01:00.690> hoping<00:01:00.870> you

was the light and tells you how much

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.030 
was the light and tells you how much
battery<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:04.110> have<00:01:04.290> on<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.500> actual<00:01:04.769> unit

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
battery you have on the actual unit

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.280 
battery you have on the actual unit
itself<00:01:05.150> other<00:01:06.150> than<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.540> what<00:01:06.869> we<00:01:06.960> have<00:01:07.110> here

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
itself other than that what we have here

itself other than that what we have here
in<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.470> back<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.010> hopefully<00:01:08.549> this<00:01:08.850> is

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
in the back and hopefully this is

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.640 
in the back and hopefully this is
visible<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.420> look<00:01:09.510> tamra<00:01:09.810> here<00:01:09.990> this<00:01:10.530> has

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
visible and look tamra here this has

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.530 
visible and look tamra here this has
twelve<00:01:10.890> thousand<00:01:11.159> milliamp<00:01:11.369> hours<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:12.360> have

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
twelve thousand milliamp hours you have

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.090 
twelve thousand milliamp hours you have
a<00:01:12.780> cable<00:01:13.110> that's<00:01:13.439> actually<00:01:13.740> pretty<00:01:13.890> much

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
a cable that's actually pretty much

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.280 
a cable that's actually pretty much
carried<00:01:14.700> with<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:14.880> at<00:01:15.060> all<00:01:15.180> times<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:16.229> know

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
carried with it at all times you know

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.780 
carried with it at all times you know
let's<00:01:16.470> just<00:01:16.530> unplug<00:01:16.950> this<00:01:17.100> real<00:01:17.280> quick<00:01:17.490> you

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
let's just unplug this real quick you

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.030 
let's just unplug this real quick you
have<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:17.970> standard<00:01:18.479> USB<00:01:18.750> two<00:01:19.140> micro<00:01:19.590> it's<00:01:19.860> a

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
have a standard USB two micro it's a

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.679 
have a standard USB two micro it's a
pretty<00:01:20.280> short<00:01:20.460> cable<00:01:20.850> but<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.210> does<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.509> job

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
pretty short cable but it does the job

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.929 
pretty short cable but it does the job
essentially<00:01:22.080> intending<00:01:22.650> for<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.009> be<00:01:23.130> used

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
essentially intending for it to be used

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.490 
essentially intending for it to be used
when<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.299> guys<00:01:24.450> are<00:01:24.630> traveling<00:01:25.080> or<00:01:25.229> be<00:01:25.439> able

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
when you guys are traveling or be able

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.160 
when you guys are traveling or be able
to<00:01:25.619> charge<00:01:26.030> this<00:01:27.030> will<00:01:27.299> basically<00:01:27.450> be<00:01:27.750> used<00:01:27.960> to

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
to charge this will basically be used to

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.960 
to charge this will basically be used to
charge<00:01:28.470> out<00:01:28.770> anything<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.579> need<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.820> charge

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
charge out anything you need to charge

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.880 
charge out anything you need to charge
out<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.630> you'll<00:01:31.140> be<00:01:31.200> using<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.619> micro

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
out of it and you'll be using the micro

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.770 
out of it and you'll be using the micro
USB<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.369> charge<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.820> in<00:01:32.970> so<00:01:33.210> when<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.540> charge

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
USB to charge it in so when you charge

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.050 
USB to charge it in so when you charge
it<00:01:33.960> in<00:01:34.079> basically<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:35.460> charge<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.790> in<00:01:35.880> from

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
it in basically you charge it in from

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.219 
it in basically you charge it in from
USBs<00:01:36.479> force<00:01:37.009> plug<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.159> in<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.720> now<00:01:39.720> it's<00:01:39.990> an

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
USBs force plug it in and now it's an

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.020 
USBs force plug it in and now it's an
actual<00:01:40.500> charging<00:01:41.040> mode<00:01:41.189> when<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:41.850> need<00:01:42.000> to

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
actual charging mode when you need to

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.789 
actual charging mode when you need to
charge<00:01:42.299> out<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:42.899> it's<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.530> reverse

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
charge out of it it's the reverse

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.719 
charge out of it it's the reverse
process<00:01:45.380> and<00:01:46.380> you'll<00:01:46.979> be<00:01:47.130> able<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.340> charge<00:01:47.490> out

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
process and you'll be able to charge out

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.280 
process and you'll be able to charge out
of<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.390> cable<00:01:48.570> like<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:48.869> said<00:01:49.020> it's<00:01:49.140> pretty

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
of it the cable like I said it's pretty

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.990 
of it the cable like I said it's pretty
short<00:01:49.560> but<00:01:49.829> overall<00:01:50.130> it's<00:01:50.460> nice<00:01:50.640> because<00:01:50.880> it's

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
short but overall it's nice because it's

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.460 
short but overall it's nice because it's
kind<00:01:51.360> of<00:01:51.420> really<00:01:51.899> good<00:01:52.049> for<00:01:52.229> cable<00:01:52.439> management

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
kind of really good for cable management

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.710 
kind of really good for cable management
whenever<00:01:53.100> you're<00:01:53.250> traveling<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.820> looking<00:01:54.570> bad

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
whenever you're traveling I looking bad

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.149 
whenever you're traveling I looking bad
there's<00:01:54.930> really<00:01:55.110> not<00:01:55.290> much<00:01:55.500> on<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.890> unit

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
there's really not much on the unit

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.580 
there's really not much on the unit
itself<00:01:56.509> pretty<00:01:57.509> nice<00:01:57.750> light<00:01:57.990> color<00:01:58.140> design<00:01:58.560> I

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
itself pretty nice light color design I

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.410 
itself pretty nice light color design I
went<00:01:58.920> with<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.159> actual<00:01:59.490> stone<00:01:59.759> design<00:02:00.119> or

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
went with the actual stone design or

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.090 
went with the actual stone design or
basically<00:02:01.200> looking<00:02:01.469> more<00:02:01.710> like<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.890> stone

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
basically looking more like a stone

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.170 
basically looking more like a stone
design<00:02:02.340> I'll<00:02:02.520> show<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:02.759> guys<00:02:02.909> some<00:02:03.060> pictures

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
design I'll show you guys some pictures

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.780 
design I'll show you guys some pictures
later<00:02:03.509> on<00:02:03.750> but<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.979> unit<00:02:05.189> itself<00:02:05.460> feels

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
later on but the unit itself feels

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.280 
later on but the unit itself feels
pretty<00:02:06.030> good<00:02:06.240> twelve<00:02:06.840> thousand<00:02:07.079> milliamp

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
pretty good twelve thousand milliamp

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.499 
pretty good twelve thousand milliamp
hour<00:02:07.530> battery<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:08.489> works<00:02:08.700> pretty<00:02:09.000> well<00:02:09.119> as<00:02:09.300> far

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
hour battery it works pretty well as far

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
need to provide that on your own the

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.930 
need to provide that on your own the
package<00:02:26.860> itself<00:02:27.130> only<00:02:27.310> comes<00:02:27.610> with<00:02:27.820> the

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
package itself only comes with the

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.200 
package itself only comes with the
actual<00:02:28.240> unit<00:02:28.540> itself<00:02:28.810> embedded<00:02:29.320> inside<00:02:29.440> and

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
actual unit itself embedded inside and

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.650 
actual unit itself embedded inside and
it's<00:02:31.210> pretty<00:02:31.330> good

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
it's pretty good

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.570 
it's pretty good
so<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:32.170> actual<00:02:32.440> design<00:02:32.710> in<00:02:32.860> the<00:02:32.950> power<00:02:33.400> bank

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
so the actual design in the power bank

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.040 
so the actual design in the power bank
itself<00:02:33.820> provides<00:02:34.270> what<00:02:34.480> it's<00:02:34.630> intended

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
itself provides what it's intended

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.840 
itself provides what it's intended
it's<00:02:35.200> a<00:02:35.290> 1200<00:02:35.740> mega<00:02:35.860> power<00:02:36.130> bank<00:02:36.400> and<00:02:36.610> it<00:02:36.760> will

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
it's a 1200 mega power bank and it will

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.550 
it's a 1200 mega power bank and it will
charge<00:02:37.030> almost<00:02:37.330> all<00:02:37.690> my<00:02:37.870> devices<00:02:38.050> at<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:38.530> same

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
charge almost all my devices at the same

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.040 
charge almost all my devices at the same
time<00:02:38.920> and<00:02:39.310> I<00:02:39.430> say<00:02:39.580> almost<00:02:39.790> because<00:02:40.150> I<00:02:40.660> have<00:02:41.020> a

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
time and I say almost because I have a

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.860 
time and I say almost because I have a

no.3 a Nexus 5 and Nexus an HTC One that

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.270 
no.3 a Nexus 5 and Nexus an HTC One that
I<00:02:43.900> generally<00:02:44.200> carry<00:02:44.500> with<00:02:44.650> me<00:02:44.680> most<00:02:45.070> of<00:02:45.220> the

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
I generally carry with me most of the

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.160 
I generally carry with me most of the
time<00:02:45.340> and<00:02:45.730> I<00:02:46.240> can<00:02:46.510> pretty<00:02:46.690> much<00:02:46.780> get<00:02:47.020> those

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
time and I can pretty much get those

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.890 
time and I can pretty much get those
things<00:02:47.380> a<00:02:47.560> charge<00:02:48.130> but<00:02:48.490> again<00:02:48.850> as<00:02:49.090> one<00:02:49.750> thing

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
things a charge but again as one thing

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:50.970 
things a charge but again as one thing
you<00:02:49.990> probably<00:02:50.260> have<00:02:50.440> noticed<00:02:50.740> when<00:02:50.830> I<00:02:50.890> was

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
you probably have noticed when I was

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.200 
you probably have noticed when I was
showing<00:02:51.100> you<00:02:51.250> guys<00:02:51.370> on<00:02:51.520> the<00:02:51.580> hands<00:02:51.820> on<00:02:51.910> it<00:02:52.090> only

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
showing you guys on the hands on it only

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.360 
showing you guys on the hands on it only
has<00:02:52.420> one<00:02:52.450> output<00:02:53.020> so<00:02:53.500> you<00:02:53.770> can<00:02:54.100> only<00:02:54.190> charge

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
has one output so you can only charge

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.130 
has one output so you can only charge
one<00:02:54.490> thing<00:02:54.940> at<00:02:55.090> a<00:02:55.120> time<00:02:55.180> you<00:02:55.570> have<00:02:55.930> to<00:02:56.020> keep

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
one thing at a time you have to keep

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.420 
one thing at a time you have to keep
that<00:02:56.290> in<00:02:56.350> mind<00:02:56.590> with<00:02:56.710> this<00:02:56.830> year<00:02:57.010> that<00:02:57.130> it<00:02:57.310> does

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
that in mind with this year that it does

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.710 
that in mind with this year that it does
charge<00:02:57.670> pretty<00:02:57.880> well<00:02:58.060> and<00:02:58.210> it<00:02:58.300> provides<00:02:58.600> me

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
charge pretty well and it provides me

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.870 
charge pretty well and it provides me
with<00:02:58.780> fast<00:02:59.110> charging<00:02:59.470> so<00:02:59.770> the<00:03:00.220> charging<00:03:00.850> time

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
with fast charging so the charging time

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.060 
with fast charging so the charging time
will<00:03:01.150> be<00:03:01.270> fast<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:02.140> recharge<00:03:02.680> time<00:03:02.710> is

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
will be fast the recharge time is

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.890 
will be fast the recharge time is
slightly<00:03:03.280> slower<00:03:03.550> which<00:03:04.030> takes<00:03:04.300> it<00:03:04.420> longer<00:03:04.870> so

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
slightly slower which takes it longer so

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.150 
slightly slower which takes it longer so
you<00:03:05.170> probably<00:03:05.320> want<00:03:05.560> to<00:03:05.590> do<00:03:05.710> if<00:03:06.040> you're

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
you probably want to do if you're

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.680

on Amazon right now there's two
different<00:03:37.450> colors<00:03:37.840> I<00:03:37.930> chose<00:03:38.170> the<00:03:38.380> ash<00:03:38.680> gray

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
different colors I chose the ash gray

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.500 
different colors I chose the ash gray
version<00:03:39.430> of<00:03:39.550> it<00:03:39.640> which<00:03:39.850> kind<00:03:40.120> of<00:03:40.180> looks<00:03:40.330> like<00:03:40.390> a

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
version of it which kind of looks like a

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.080 
version of it which kind of looks like a
regular<00:03:40.690> stone<00:03:41.050> and<00:03:41.490> it<00:03:42.490> actually<00:03:42.640> fits<00:03:42.880> very

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
regular stone and it actually fits very

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.640 
regular stone and it actually fits very
well<00:03:43.330> and<00:03:43.540> I<00:03:43.570> liked<00:03:43.780> the<00:03:43.960> design<00:03:44.230> the<00:03:44.380> way<00:03:44.500> it's

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
well and I liked the design the way it's

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.770 
well and I liked the design the way it's
fitting<00:03:44.920> like<00:03:45.070> this<00:03:45.280> because<00:03:45.640> most<00:03:46.540> of<00:03:46.690> the

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
fitting like this because most of the

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.090 
fitting like this because most of the
time<00:03:46.900> I<00:03:46.930> have<00:03:47.110> this<00:03:47.200> on<00:03:47.380> the<00:03:47.440> back<00:03:47.500> um<00:03:47.740> in<00:03:47.920> the

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
time I have this on the back um in the

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.310 
time I have this on the back um in the
bottom<00:03:48.550> back<00:03:49.030> part<00:03:49.330> of<00:03:49.420> my<00:03:49.510> backpack<00:03:49.930> so<00:03:50.140> it's

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
bottom back part of my backpack so it's

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.720 
bottom back part of my backpack so it's
sitting<00:03:50.590> in<00:03:50.680> a<00:03:50.740> kind<00:03:50.920> of<00:03:50.980> a<00:03:51.040> vertical<00:03:51.310> way<00:03:51.520> I

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
sitting in a kind of a vertical way I

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.670 
sitting in a kind of a vertical way I
run<00:03:52.150> a<00:03:52.210> longer<00:03:52.570> cable<00:03:52.960> and<00:03:53.110> I<00:03:53.140> just<00:03:53.320> extend

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
run a longer cable and I just extend

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.870 
run a longer cable and I just extend
that<00:03:53.800> from<00:03:53.950> the<00:03:54.040> backpack<00:03:54.400> and<00:03:54.580> I'm<00:03:54.640> able<00:03:54.730> to

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
that from the backpack and I'm able to

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.840 
that from the backpack and I'm able to
charge<00:03:55.180> my<00:03:55.330> devices<00:03:55.860> I've<00:03:56.860> had<00:03:57.100> some<00:03:57.670> hidden

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
charge my devices I've had some hidden

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.280 
charge my devices I've had some hidden
miss<00:03:58.120> with<00:03:58.300> different<00:03:58.630> cables<00:03:58.960> depending

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
miss with different cables depending

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.690 
miss with different cables depending
what<00:03:59.350> I'm<00:03:59.470> using<00:03:59.650> as<00:03:59.860> far<00:04:00.040> as<00:04:00.130> charging<00:04:00.460> I

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
what I'm using as far as charging I

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.820 
what I'm using as far as charging I
think<00:04:01.270> it<00:04:01.360> really<00:04:01.660> is<00:04:01.810> depending<00:04:02.530> on<00:04:02.590> what<00:04:02.710> you

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
think it really is depending on what you

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.200 
think it really is depending on what you
pet<00:04:03.010> what<00:04:03.160> you<00:04:03.250> have<00:04:03.400> just<00:04:03.640> make<00:04:04.030> sure<00:04:04.120> you

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.210 
pet what you have just make sure you

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:05.250 
pet what you have just make sure you
have<00:04:04.330> good<00:04:04.450> set<00:04:04.630> of<00:04:04.720> cables<00:04:05.020> and<00:04:05.140> you'd

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
have good set of cables and you'd

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.990 
have good set of cables and you'd
probably<00:04:05.650> be<00:04:05.890> more<00:04:06.190> than<00:04:06.370> likely<00:04:06.550> get<00:04:06.760> a<00:04:06.790> big

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
probably be more than likely get a big

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.940 
probably be more than likely get a big
charge<00:04:07.150> out<00:04:07.390> of<00:04:07.420> it<00:04:07.600> it<00:04:08.470> does<00:04:08.680> pretty<00:04:08.890> well

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
charge out of it it does pretty well

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.010 
charge out of it it does pretty well
that<00:04:09.190> it<00:04:09.280> works<00:04:09.460> very<00:04:09.670> nice<00:04:09.970> and<00:04:10.180> I've<00:04:10.720> had<00:04:10.990> a

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
that it works very nice and I've had a

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.600 
that it works very nice and I've had a
few<00:04:11.290> people<00:04:11.410> ask<00:04:11.620> me<00:04:11.800> as<00:04:11.890> far<00:04:12.070> as<00:04:12.160> what<00:04:12.310> it<00:04:12.400> kind

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
few people ask me as far as what it kind

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:13.860 
few people ask me as far as what it kind
of<00:04:12.640> what<00:04:12.820> it<00:04:12.910> is<00:04:12.940> because<00:04:13.210> it's<00:04:13.480> initially

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
of what it is because it's initially

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.090 
of what it is because it's initially
when<00:04:13.990> you<00:04:14.020> pull<00:04:14.260> it<00:04:14.350> out<00:04:14.410> it<00:04:14.620> does<00:04:14.770> not<00:04:14.800> look

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
when you pull it out it does not look

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.330 
when you pull it out it does not look
like<00:04:15.130> a<00:04:15.280> char<00:04:15.580> a<00:04:15.610> standard<00:04:16.150> power<00:04:16.270> bank<00:04:17.340> you
