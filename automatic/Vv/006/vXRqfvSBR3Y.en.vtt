00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.220
 mind life 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.310
 Start by applying your foundation 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:00.250
 I used the culture leave after I go 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:03.970
 to use this palette with this tone that 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:07.120
 it's a white vanilla and it has a 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.590
 something subtle lighting I'm going to combine 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.330
 with another but you can see here from 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.940
 immediate as it already begins to stand out 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.070
 now this o o o grove and really 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.720
 It was like a glitter and that's what 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.710
 fascinates me can you see it here but not 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.530
 is very well focused 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.680
 but that glitter makes them look 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.200
 like more pieces in the eyelid 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.470
 and that I loved for this look with the 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.200
 brush are not noticed so much if you use it 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:35.259
 with your finger it looks perfect and get out 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.119
 of pretty strooper so now I'm going to 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:40.149
 take a little bit the copper quoted I'm 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.530
 putting nothing else in the basin of the d 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:43.659
 eyelid 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.260
 and now again I take a 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:51.009
 little bit of that vanilla to put it on 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.960
 the center and that I highlight a little bit more and 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:56.200
 I bring combined also what is the the 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.659
 copper later I'm going to use palladium 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.580
 what is the eyeliner and now we are going to 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.220
 make a tail to highlight a 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.890
 little bit more the eyes apologize again so 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.170
 García Juarez should go from a little 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.149

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.160
 I did well if I have other videos where 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.530
 you can see how it's done but not 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.660
 it is simply pasted to the tab and 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.730
 just a tail and now for 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.709
 to lift him more the look I applied some 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.920
 false eyelashes of Algiers that can 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:26.050
 see here immediately in the difference and 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.670
 after I'm applying the mascara this one 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.950
 Der der der me that is one of the best 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.170
