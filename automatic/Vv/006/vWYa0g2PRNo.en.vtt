00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.940
 and many citizens were used oil to a place especially 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.540
 enabled this is within this second stage that this in the latter 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.350
 quarter of the year that we are trying to vote that has to do 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.710
 with percent 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.760
 that the neighbor before the common domicile that will not make it arrive his so 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.259
 visit and generate their own 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.020
 adhering to 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.880
 are now what we are doing in that place of sales in the region 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.180
 Classifieds that are in front of the municipal cemetery 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.960
 per cent we did not even get sabanés the 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.119
 the neighbor goes with his plastic highness in st 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.730
 and deposit it in that place as necessary we will get to the collection center 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.490

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.689
 to the mobile green point that does not 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:56.149
 in a special waste collection system that starts tomorrow 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.539
 its traveled through the different neighborhoods of the city 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:59.909
 is proven 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.149
 that a liter of oil contaminates a thousand liters of water in case it ends in 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.450
 contact with groundwater lagoons streams or rivers 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:12.819
 biofuels, on the other hand, generate less harmful gases 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.209
 greenhouse and pollutants improving 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.459
 environmental charity if we consider that oil previously ends in a 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:22.669
 sewer drain 

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:26.589
 which this management is editing that happens we are avoiding 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.839
 to put before a great contamination especially of water of underground water 

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:35.679
 percent and we are also avoiding problems in the 

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:38.429
 in the treatment of those sewage liquids 

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:41.679
 because we are avoiding that 12 thousand liters of oil that was what 

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:46.959
 sent to do in training will end in the rats the city means a 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.959
 investment raised squared 

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:55.760
 the vast majority that if we consider the benefits it will bring for 

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:56.849
 city ​​and for 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:58.369
 there for the neighbors

 it is planned for a year for this year to finish with the collection center 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.570
 that we are building ships and not sanitary 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.670
 that in itself generated no particular investment and is also making a 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.670
 feasibility study so that the future 

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:18.950
