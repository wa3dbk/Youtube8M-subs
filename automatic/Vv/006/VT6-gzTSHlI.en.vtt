now<00:00:51.739> this<00:00:51.920> piece<00:00:52.160> is<00:00:52.309> still<00:00:52.489> good<00:00:52.640> for<00:00:52.760> another

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
now this piece is still good for another

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:54.759 
now this piece is still good for another
application<00:00:53.359> so<00:00:53.719> set<00:00:53.899> it<00:00:53.989> aside<00:00:54.079> use<00:00:54.530> it<00:00:54.649> on<00:00:54.739> a

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
existing pipe take coughing m1 silicone

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:04.210 
existing pipe take coughing m1 silicone
whatever<00:01:02.839> you<00:01:02.929> have<00:01:03.109> put<00:01:03.920> it<00:01:04.010> all<00:01:04.100> the<00:01:04.190> way

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
around and this just keeps methane gas

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.410 
around and this just keeps methane gas
from<00:01:06.740> escaping<00:01:07.190> in<00:01:07.460> between

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
from escaping in between

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.240 
from escaping in between
now<00:01:08.960> if<00:01:09.170> you're<00:01:09.320> putting<00:01:09.409> the<00:01:09.619> lead<00:01:09.770> boot<00:01:09.950> over

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
on as you normally would flash it in and

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.719 
on as you normally would flash it in and
you're<00:01:14.659> done<00:01:14.810> if<00:01:15.530> you're<00:01:15.710> doing<00:01:15.920> tpo<00:01:16.250> you<00:01:16.580> can

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
you're done if you're doing tpo you can

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:18.429 
you're done if you're doing tpo you can
put<00:01:16.850> your<00:01:16.939> TPO<00:01:17.270> tape<00:01:17.540> around<00:01:17.780> it<00:01:17.960> and<00:01:18.140> adhere

put your TPO tape around it and adhere
to<00:01:18.530> that<00:01:18.590> tape<00:01:18.920> and<00:01:19.130> if<00:01:19.460> you're<00:01:19.580> doing<00:01:19.790> PVC<00:01:20.330> you

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
to that tape and if you're doing PVC you

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.030 
to that tape and if you're doing PVC you
can<00:01:20.659> adhere<00:01:20.780> it<00:01:20.990> directly<00:01:21.380> to<00:01:21.560> your<00:01:21.680> two<00:01:21.830> boats
