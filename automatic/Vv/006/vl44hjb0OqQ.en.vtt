over harvesting the area um if you if it

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.730 
over harvesting the area um if you if it
takes<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:49.290> not<00:01:49.500> pretty<00:01:50.130> well<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:51.530> it's<00:01:52.530> got

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
takes a not pretty well and it's got

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.030 
takes a not pretty well and it's got
some<00:01:52.950> pretty<00:01:53.159> good<00:01:53.280> strength<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:55.040> the

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
some pretty good strength to it the

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.679 
some pretty good strength to it the
chances<00:01:56.820> are<00:01:56.909> two<00:01:57.090> probably<00:01:57.390> make<00:01:57.509> pretty

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
chances are two probably make pretty

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.160 
chances are two probably make pretty
good<00:01:57.780> cordage<00:01:58.640> alright<00:01:59.640> so<00:02:00.090> i'm<00:02:00.990> going<00:02:01.079> to

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
good cordage alright so i'm going to

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.100 
good cordage alright so i'm going to
show<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.500> reverse<00:02:01.829> twist<00:02:02.219> technique<00:02:03.110> for

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
show you the reverse twist technique for

fiber<00:05:39.979> so<00:05:40.280> again<00:05:40.520> I'm<00:05:40.669> twisting<00:05:41.090> away<00:05:41.210> and

00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:42.159 
fiber so again I'm twisting away and

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:44.890 
fiber so again I'm twisting away and
pulling<00:05:43.159> and<00:05:43.310> grabbing<00:05:44.300> the<00:05:44.389> bottom<00:05:44.719> piece

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
pulling and grabbing the bottom piece

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.110 
pulling and grabbing the bottom piece
and<00:05:45.139> twisting<00:05:45.500> towards<00:05:45.680> myself<00:05:45.949> so<00:05:46.940> it's

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
and twisting towards myself so it's

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.850 
and twisting towards myself so it's
twisting<00:05:47.569> on<00:05:47.719> itself<00:05:48.080> so<00:05:48.289> it<00:05:48.349> wants<00:05:48.590> to<00:05:48.710> come

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 
twisting on itself so it wants to come

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.600 
twisting on itself so it wants to come
undone<00:05:49.250> but<00:05:49.430> can't<00:05:49.900> okay<00:05:50.900> and<00:05:51.199> by<00:05:52.099> twisting

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
undone but can't okay and by twisting

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.920 
undone but can't okay and by twisting
you're<00:05:52.759> adding<00:05:53.120> strength<00:05:54.039> to<00:05:55.039> the<00:05:55.279> two

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
you're adding strength to the two

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.019 
you're adding strength to the two
lashings<00:05:56.930> which<00:05:57.229> become<00:05:58.009> one<00:05:58.310> and<00:05:58.580> becomes

00:05:59.019 --> 00:05:59.029 
lashings which become one and becomes

00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:03.040 
lashings which become one and becomes
even<00:05:59.990> stronger<00:06:00.259> okay<00:06:01.190> but<00:06:02.060> by<00:06:02.270> itself<00:06:02.750> the

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.050 
even stronger okay but by itself the

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.870 
even stronger okay but by itself the
lashing<00:06:03.500> is<00:06:03.590> still<00:06:03.830> useful<00:06:04.069> you<00:06:04.460> don't<00:06:04.639> have

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 
lashing is still useful you don't have

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.629 
lashing is still useful you don't have
to<00:06:05.120> do<00:06:05.270> this<00:06:05.860> you<00:06:06.860> don't<00:06:07.039> have<00:06:07.130> to<00:06:07.219> waste<00:06:07.430> the

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:07.639 
to do this you don't have to waste the

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:09.279 
to do this you don't have to waste the
time<00:06:07.909> to<00:06:08.210> do<00:06:08.389> this<00:06:08.599> and<00:06:08.870> you<00:06:08.960> just<00:06:09.110> need

the thicker the more the fibers that you

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.250 
the thicker the more the fibers that you
lashes<00:07:00.310> that<00:07:00.340> you<00:07:00.610> use<00:07:00.880> the<00:07:01.600> stronger<00:07:02.080> it's

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:02.260 
lashes that you use the stronger it's

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:07.320 
lashes that you use the stronger it's
going<00:07:02.440> to<00:07:02.530> be<00:07:02.650> okay<00:07:03.370> so<00:07:04.180> what<00:07:04.540> so<00:07:05.910> plants<00:07:06.910> like

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:07.330 
going to be okay so what so plants like

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.990 
going to be okay so what so plants like
dogbane<00:07:08.020> that<00:07:08.440> were<00:07:08.560> traditionally<00:07:08.770> used<00:07:09.520> for

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.000 
dogbane that were traditionally used for

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.390 
dogbane that were traditionally used for
both<00:07:10.150> strings<00:07:10.540> and<00:07:12.000> plants<00:07:13.000> like<00:07:14.250> dare<00:07:15.250> i<00:07:15.280> say

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:15.400 
both strings and plants like dare i say

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:20.000 
both strings and plants like dare i say
hemp<00:07:16.800> they're<00:07:17.800> very<00:07:18.070> very<00:07:18.250> strong<00:07:18.580> fibers<00:07:19.210> and

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:20.010 
hemp they're very very strong fibers and

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:22.740 
hemp they're very very strong fibers and
so<00:07:21.010> even<00:07:21.310> a<00:07:21.400> little<00:07:21.580> bit<00:07:21.700> will<00:07:22.030> go<00:07:22.060> a<00:07:22.210> long<00:07:22.419> way

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:22.750 
so even a little bit will go a long way

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:25.379 
so even a little bit will go a long way
okay<00:07:23.530> so<00:07:24.280> you'll<00:07:24.520> find<00:07:24.789> that<00:07:24.940> this<00:07:25.120> will<00:07:25.300> be

00:07:25.379 --> 00:07:25.389 
okay so you'll find that this will be

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:27.270 
okay so you'll find that this will be
good<00:07:25.539> for<00:07:25.600> most<00:07:25.990> things<00:07:26.260> but<00:07:26.560> it's<00:07:26.740> not<00:07:26.950> you

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:27.280 
good for most things but it's not you

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.310 
good for most things but it's not you
know<00:07:27.310> under<00:07:27.700> you<00:07:28.240> know<00:07:28.360> I<00:07:28.660> don't<00:07:29.020> know<00:07:29.080> what<00:07:29.200> it

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:29.320 
know under you know I don't know what it

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.040 
know under you know I don't know what it
probably<00:07:29.620> take<00:07:29.889> about<00:07:30.010> a<00:07:30.130> good<00:07:30.510> you<00:07:31.510> know<00:07:31.660> 40

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:32.050 
probably take about a good you know 40

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.189 
probably take about a good you know 40
pounds<00:07:32.500> to<00:07:32.650> break<00:07:32.889> this<00:07:33.160> as<00:07:33.430> it<00:07:33.729> stands<00:07:34.000> now

00:07:34.189 --> 00:07:34.199 
pounds to break this as it stands now

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:36.750 
pounds to break this as it stands now
okay<00:07:35.199> but<00:07:35.830> if<00:07:35.949> you<00:07:35.979> need<00:07:36.160> some<00:07:36.400> heavy<00:07:36.550> duty

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:36.760 
okay but if you need some heavy duty

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.960 
okay but if you need some heavy duty
stuff<00:07:37.180> and<00:07:37.479> using<00:07:38.410> velvetleaf<00:07:38.919> it<00:07:39.370> probably

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:39.970 
stuff and using velvetleaf it probably

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:41.279 
stuff and using velvetleaf it probably
have<00:07:40.060> to<00:07:40.210> be<00:07:40.240> a<00:07:40.360> little<00:07:40.600> thicker<00:07:40.870> it<00:07:41.050> have<00:07:41.169> to

00:07:41.279 --> 00:07:41.289 
have to be a little thicker it have to

00:07:41.289 --> 00:07:43.020 
have to be a little thicker it have to
be<00:07:41.320> twice<00:07:41.650> this<00:07:42.010> you<00:07:42.370> know<00:07:42.490> if<00:07:42.580> you<00:07:42.669> wanted<00:07:42.910> to

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:43.030 
be twice this you know if you wanted to

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:45.000 
be twice this you know if you wanted to
get<00:07:43.120> it<00:07:43.270> to<00:07:43.389> take<00:07:43.780> up<00:07:43.930> to<00:07:44.050> maybe<00:07:44.200> 50<00:07:44.620> to<00:07:44.650> 100

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:45.010 
get it to take up to maybe 50 to 100

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:49.800 
get it to take up to maybe 50 to 100
pounds<00:07:45.340> of<00:07:45.430> pull<00:07:46.060> or<00:07:46.270> pressure<00:07:47.100> okay<00:07:48.100> but<00:07:49.000> you

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:49.810 
pounds of pull or pressure okay but you

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:51.330 
pounds of pull or pressure okay but you
know<00:07:49.900> in<00:07:50.050> a<00:07:50.110> quick<00:07:50.320> pinch<00:07:50.650> this<00:07:50.919> stuff<00:07:51.190> is
