00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:07.520
 well let's cook my x of potatoes for 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.520
 this is needed 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.870
 two kilos of potatoes 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.059
 six cups of flour 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.320
 four tablespoons girls salt 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.550
 and two large spoons of oil 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.620
 to all this we peel the potatoes the potatoes 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.260
 You can peel by hand but I prefer 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.910
 use the apple peeler that suits 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.430
 to peel potatoes that faster 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.670
 and much more practical much faster 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.670
 as well 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.190
 it peels good speed 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.830
 after we have the peeled potatoes 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:01.110
 We put them in a pot and try to 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.000
 chop it well first so they cook 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.250
 faster 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.180
 and we can make a pot with water and the 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.130
 we leave serving as for purees that 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.270
 are soft, soft enough to 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.579
 mashed potatoes 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.130
 once they are put in a 

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:21.799
 processing vessel or other 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.799
 containers and we will make it by hand 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.390
 to this one 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.250
 and then we put the flour 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.250
 the 6 cups of flour 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.980
 very easy to make is a recipe very 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.960
 fast 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:50.299
 it does not take long 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.299
 and this very practical 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.210
 apart from those years that look good 

00:01:54.359 --> 00:02:00.719
 Tastes are not those that give with taste 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.200
 of the flour and apart from that they are soft 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.890
 they are not hard as the children that darÃ­n to 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.659
 then we can launch 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.659
 four tablespoons girls salt 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.200
 two spoons 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.770
 and then we mix it with the machine 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.810
 or by hand as I said no 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.850
 they need to mix it much later 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.990
 we will return with flour 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.990
 and we put the dough 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.490
 we cut 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.670
 we spent it with the palote more or less a 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.590
 centimeter in height 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.569
 a centimeter more or less natural 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.710
 we have to fail to not support them 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.410
 much in crushing it a lot 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.570
 and we also cut it to more or less a 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.230
 centimeter remaining strips of 1 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.230
 centimeter 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.750
 as I said earlier we have to throw him 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.670
 pretty flour when we're 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.820
 cutting and everything to prevent it from 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.370
 hit then we grabbed a tray and the 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:10.020
 gunpowder flour voice 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.940
 and there we are putting them 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.180
 we cut it again another centimeter 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.430
 What remains as a square 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.620
 do not worry about passing it by fork 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.480
 or anything like that to give it the form 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.719
 because once they are cooked the 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.730
 way it goes so it looks good alright 

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:27.920
 round and with good shape so that 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.640
 do not worry and in magic the best 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:34.030
 way is faster 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:38.420
 once the tray is done what 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:41.110
 we put to freeze more or less 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:44.120
 At least two hours 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.890
 there it is , we put it to freeze 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.620
 at least two hours and then the 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.340
 we take out and pocket those that do not go 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.140
 lets go cook 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.599
 and the others we put them frozen 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.870
 directly into the pot where we go 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:57.870
 let's cook 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.480
 and the next will be enjoyed and there 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:08.260
 they have the famous 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.260
 of potato
