00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.280
 Hello 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.700
 hello my gratitude welcome once again 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.350
 to the official android advice channel the 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.240
 channel where you will find everything that 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.770
 are you looking for android good already 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.800
 you know that the new update of 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.980
 gmail has changed the interface a bit and 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.480
 You can also change the function a bit 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.460
 especially when removing 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.620
 emails for example before we knew that 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.900
 if we leave a mail selected here 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.190
 up here because it did not appear 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.290
 there was the option to delete this 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.790
 mail now, it does not appear anymore 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.320
 that we would have to come to the settings and 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.489
 give it to eliminate and good would be a little 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.980
 coÃ±azo as good in this tutorial I will 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.020
 I'm going to teach how we can put 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.579
 that when we mark an email that 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.030
 We want to eliminate two or three or who 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.590
 we want up here they can not 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.720
 leave the option to delete this mail 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.979
 and also so that when we get a 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.710
 mail in our bar 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.600
 notifications that appears here we 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.979
 the mail has arrived, so from here 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.479
 You can also delete this 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.880
 mail if you see that a mail then that 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.090
 we are interested 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.219
 How we do 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.509
 this is very easy we enter the 

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:28.700
 gmail application 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:32.539
 in which I have it open we come to 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.829
 the adjustments and we give adjustments we come 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:36.190
 here to the settings first of all 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:37.810
 we come to adjustments worth 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.300
 Now we have to give you adjustments 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.930
 General and once the settings are open 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.790
 general 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.690
 in the first box that you can file 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.160
 and eliminate here we will be marked the 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.480
 option to show only archived 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.450
 we are going to put the option of 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.460
 show only removed we select it 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.460
 and let's say back and forth 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.840
 again it's worth it now it's already removed with this 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.730
 we have managed to be able to select 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.190
 the mail we want and we can do it 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.780
 delete and good for you to check it 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.760
 for example, he marked the first and the 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.310
 second mail or just the first one and I already 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.530
 appears here as you are seeing the 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.140
 trash can symbol on 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.510
 which could then eliminate it and so 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.410
 easy friends and good also if I 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.100
 an email arrives at the bar 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.990
 notifications here then it will come out here 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.790
 the option to delete emails and deleted 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.250
 just pressing a simple button from the 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.200
 notifications bar and well now yes 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.570
