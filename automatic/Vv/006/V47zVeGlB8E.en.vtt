00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.689
 part of the building 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.890
 the cause for this is not yet 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.810
 completely clear 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.700
 Contractor has said they are building 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.770
 that it was stronger that it was 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.480
 more metals and also yes more 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.579
 concrete than they actually expected 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.280
 but so today another attempt 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.530
 And yes let's see how it will end 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.930
 today yes Saturday the demolition was real 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.350

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.559
 with cameras yes it is today 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.199
 of course ordinary weekday we 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.120
 there are some neighbors watching 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.710
 especially some older people so yes there are 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.840
 people watch but it is substantial 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.840
 less busy last Saturday 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.900
 the medicine bus look where 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.870
 happened now it still takes 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.460
 dynamite in it I think they just got it 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.740
 cells should use the system as 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.110
 by the day we maybe the doctors 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.520
 large kangaroo hammer is there from above 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.660
 go on 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.540
 it may take a little longer but that 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:38.640
 is also piece safe so today is 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.390
 something not really on it looks like erik 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.390

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.750
 yes they are now stopped heavy with 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.950
 half an hour non-stop basic 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.869
 activities are logically monitored 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.880
 held just by a little helicopter 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.800
 that helicopter has taken off again 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.270
 she sends signals to the 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.100
 train drivers that bullet 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.509
 so that the Marxist is also precise 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.550
 know how to do his own safety 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.930
 sits well it can 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.030
 the expectation as first because today 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.259
 all abyss would only yes 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.790
 already sound that it might be more anyway 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.830
