locket<00:02:59.370> level<00:02:59.640> 31<00:03:00.150> it's<00:03:00.900> five<00:03:01.110> from<00:03:01.320> long

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
locket level 31 it's five from long

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.960 
locket level 31 it's five from long
range<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:01.950> obviously<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.310> unlocked<00:03:02.700> level

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
range and obviously the unlocked level

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.940 
range and obviously the unlocked level
is<00:03:03.120> 31<00:03:03.840> as<00:03:04.110> I<00:03:04.170> just<00:03:04.320> said<00:03:04.560> which<00:03:04.710> is<00:03:04.830> about

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
is 31 as I just said which is about

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.920 
is 31 as I just said which is about
halfway<00:03:05.190> through<00:03:05.460> all<00:03:05.550> the<00:03:05.640> levels<00:03:05.790> so<00:03:06.690> take<00:03:06.900> a

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
halfway through all the levels so take a

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.090 
halfway through all the levels so take a
while<00:03:07.170> to<00:03:07.290> a<00:03:07.350> lot<00:03:07.500> which<00:03:07.650> is<00:03:07.680> kind<00:03:07.950> of<00:03:07.980> the

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
while to a lot which is kind of the

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.830 
while to a lot which is kind of the
downside<00:03:08.520> in<00:03:08.640> this<00:03:08.760> gun<00:03:08.940> but<00:03:09.600> one<00:03:09.720> of<00:03:09.750> the

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
downside in this gun but one of the

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.630 
downside in this gun but one of the
things<00:03:10.200> which<00:03:10.650> was<00:03:10.800> see<00:03:10.980> soon<00:03:11.220> is<00:03:11.430> that<00:03:11.460> is

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
things which was see soon is that is

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.610 
things which was see soon is that is
super<00:03:11.970> accurate<00:03:12.330> here<00:03:12.750> if<00:03:13.020> you're<00:03:13.320> to<00:03:13.410> burst

you<00:03:32.820> can<00:03:32.940> reload<00:03:33.300> and<00:03:33.900> then<00:03:34.050> the<00:03:34.110> reload<00:03:34.380> time

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
you can reload and then the reload time

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.380 
you can reload and then the reload time
which<00:03:34.770> is<00:03:34.800> really<00:03:35.040> good<00:03:35.220> is<00:03:35.459> just<00:03:36.000> in<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.270> two

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
which is really good is just in the two

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.380 
which is really good is just in the two
seconds<00:03:36.720> it's<00:03:36.840> actually<00:03:37.110> a<00:03:37.320> one<00:03:37.920> second<00:03:38.370> 97<00:03:38.580> I

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
seconds it's actually a one second 97 I

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.780 
seconds it's actually a one second 97 I
believe<00:03:39.630> or<00:03:39.930> 95<00:03:40.590> so<00:03:41.100> along<00:03:41.310> those<00:03:41.400> lines<00:03:41.640> is

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
believe or 95 so along those lines is

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.240 
believe or 95 so along those lines is
really<00:03:42.060> good<00:03:42.360> I<00:03:42.739> wasn't<00:03:43.739> actually<00:03:43.830> expecting

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
really good I wasn't actually expecting

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.820 
really good I wasn't actually expecting
it<00:03:44.760> to<00:03:44.880> be<00:03:44.910> quite<00:03:45.180> so<00:03:45.330> good<00:03:45.540> as<00:03:45.630> it<00:03:45.780> is<00:03:45.870> but<00:03:46.140> you

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
it to be quite so good as it is but you

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.500 
it to be quite so good as it is but you
know<00:03:46.950> that's<00:03:47.160> just<00:03:47.220> the<00:03:47.430> m27<00:03:48.120> we'll<00:03:48.330> go<00:03:48.390> ahead

my little opinion on the the guns

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.640 
my little opinion on the the guns
themselves<00:03:53.760> and<00:03:54.270> seeing<00:03:54.780> which<00:03:55.200> you<00:03:55.470> guys

actually<00:03:58.770> unlocking<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.370> gunner<00:03:59.550> reasonably

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
actually unlocking the gunner reasonably

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.540 
actually unlocking the gunner reasonably
quite<00:04:00.390> a<00:04:00.420> high<00:04:00.600> rank<00:04:00.930> in<00:04:01.410> terms<00:04:02.040> of<00:04:02.250> assault

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
quite a high rank in terms of assault

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.880 
quite a high rank in terms of assault
rifles<00:04:02.940> and<00:04:03.120> through<00:04:03.270> the<00:04:03.360> game<00:04:03.540> the<00:04:04.260> accuracy

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
rifles and through the game the accuracy

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.260 
rifles and through the game the accuracy
to<00:04:04.950> actually<00:04:05.190> really<00:04:05.370> get<00:04:05.459> our<00:04:05.580> paws<00:04:05.760> both<00:04:06.060> the

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
to actually really get our paws both the

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.570 
to actually really get our paws both the
poop<00:04:06.989> both<00:04:07.320> the<00:04:07.470> bullet<00:04:07.709> spread<00:04:07.830> clips<00:04:08.160> so<00:04:08.520> you

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
poop both the bullet spread clips so you

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.680 
poop both the bullet spread clips so you
can<00:04:08.700> see<00:04:08.850> exactly<00:04:09.120> they're<00:04:09.420> actually<00:04:09.660> really

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
can see exactly they're actually really

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.960 
can see exactly they're actually really
similar<00:04:10.170> but<00:04:10.980> in<00:04:11.100> my<00:04:11.190> opinion<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.459> m2m<00:04:11.700> was

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
similar but in my opinion the m2m was

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.150 
similar but in my opinion the m2m was
just<00:04:12.120> a<00:04:12.180> tiny<00:04:12.480> bit<00:04:12.750> better<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:13.260> bullet<00:04:14.040> spread

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
just a tiny bit better the bullet spread

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.770 
just a tiny bit better the bullet spread
a<00:04:14.280> lot<00:04:14.550> better<00:04:14.700> the<00:04:14.910> reload<00:04:15.209> times<00:04:15.480> a<00:04:15.630> lot

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
a lot better the reload times a lot

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.140 
a lot better the reload times a lot
quicker<00:04:15.989> other<00:04:16.859> than<00:04:17.100> that<00:04:17.160> the<00:04:17.580> only

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
quicker other than that the only

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.150 
quicker other than that the only
downside<00:04:18.870> about<00:04:19.109> the<00:04:19.380> m27<00:04:19.739> sat<00:04:19.980> you<00:04:20.040> in

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
downside about the m27 sat you in

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.250 
downside about the m27 sat you in
Lockett<00:04:20.489> obviously<00:04:20.760> a<00:04:20.790> reasonably<00:04:21.720> a<00:04:21.750> high

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
Lockett obviously a reasonably a high

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.830 
Lockett obviously a reasonably a high
rank<00:04:22.620> so<00:04:23.160> I<00:04:23.190> would<00:04:23.850> do<00:04:24.060> you<00:04:24.510> know<00:04:24.600> I'd<00:04:24.690> probably

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
rank so I would do you know I'd probably

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.140 
rank so I would do you know I'd probably
go<00:04:25.020> into<00:04:25.169> more<00:04:25.350> detail<00:04:25.710> that<00:04:25.860> really

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
go into more detail that really

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.670 
go into more detail that really
that<00:04:26.479> much<00:04:26.600> more<00:04:26.780> detail<00:04:27.110> I<00:04:27.229> mean<00:04:27.380> I<00:04:27.440> could<00:04:27.560> go

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
that much more detail I mean I could go

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.620 
that much more detail I mean I could go
