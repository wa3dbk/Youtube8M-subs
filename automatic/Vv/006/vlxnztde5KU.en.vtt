brush it has a little hint of green in
it<00:01:57.119> too<00:01:57.299> so<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.810> just<00:01:57.840> all<00:01:58.469> works<00:01:58.890> together

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
it too so it just all works together

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.590 
it too so it just all works together
really<00:01:59.520> nicely<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.149> I'm<00:02:00.299> just<00:02:00.420> going<00:02:00.509> to

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
really nicely and I'm just going to

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.569 
really nicely and I'm just going to
apply<00:02:00.750> that<00:02:00.960> on<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.500> center<00:02:02.100> part<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.490> the

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
apply that on to the center part of the

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.100 
apply that on to the center part of the
lid<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:03.060> we<00:02:03.180> kept<00:02:03.450> untouched<00:02:03.840> earlier<00:02:04.729> and

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
lid that we kept untouched earlier and

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.790 
lid that we kept untouched earlier and
then<00:02:07.110> just<00:02:07.290> slightly<00:02:07.729> blend<00:02:08.729> all<00:02:09.000> that<00:02:09.270> in

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
then just slightly blend all that in

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.890 
then just slightly blend all that in
blend<00:02:10.800> it<00:02:10.950> into<00:02:11.099> both<00:02:11.430> sides

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
blend it into both sides

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.530 
blend it into both sides
so<00:02:13.900> that<00:02:14.110> it<00:02:14.230> doesn't<00:02:14.410> look<00:02:14.680> strange<00:02:15.580> I'm<00:02:16.180> even

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
so that it doesn't look strange I'm even

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.240 
so that it doesn't look strange I'm even
going<00:02:16.630> to<00:02:16.720> take<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:16.989> side<00:02:17.170> that<00:02:17.349> had<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.739> mint

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
words to into the gold so that it just

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.229

looks<00:02:24.069> more<00:02:24.250> effortless<00:02:24.760> like<00:02:25.000> it<00:02:25.090> doesn't
