I'm just going to be doing a review on
my<00:00:05.279> gun<00:00:05.520> update<00:00:06.319> kind<00:00:07.319> of<00:00:07.440> you<00:00:07.649> know<00:00:07.680> like<00:00:07.799> to

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
something neat so let's just get right

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.999 
something neat so let's just get right
into<00:00:12.570> it<00:00:12.719> because<00:00:13.230> I<00:00:13.559> don't<00:00:13.710> have<00:00:13.799> a<00:00:13.830> lot<00:00:13.980> of

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
into it because I don't have a lot of

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.820 
into it because I don't have a lot of
time<00:00:14.250> all<00:00:14.969> right<00:00:15.120> I<00:00:15.179> put<00:00:15.450> an<00:00:15.540> s<00:00:15.660> IR<00:00:16.020> rail<00:00:16.440> system

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
time all right I put an s IR rail system

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.769 
time all right I put an s IR rail system
on<00:00:16.949> it<00:00:17.039> not<00:00:17.190> R<00:00:17.460> is<00:00:17.640> s<00:00:18.150> IR<00:00:19.580> you'll<00:00:20.580> notice<00:00:20.910> it's

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
on it not R is s IR you'll notice it's

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.830 
on it not R is s IR you'll notice it's
what<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.289> inner<00:00:22.560> it's<00:00:23.100> what<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.369> S<00:00:23.970> systems

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
what the inner it's what the S systems

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.939 
what the inner it's what the S systems
use<00:00:25.080> but<00:00:25.619> this<00:00:26.519> is<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.849> SI<00:00:27.090> our<00:00:27.240> rail<00:00:27.420> system

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 
use but this is the SI our rail system

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:33.220 
use but this is the SI our rail system

snake skin paint job on both sides let

00:00:48.660 --> 00:01:04.520 
snake skin paint job on both sides let
me<00:00:48.719> flip<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.050> over<00:00:49.230> for<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:56.000> yeah<00:01:00.079> so<00:01:03.530> that's

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
me flip it over for you yeah so that's

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.760 
me flip it over for you yeah so that's
pretty<00:01:04.739> much<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.630> let<00:01:06.630> me<00:01:06.720> just<00:01:06.930> do<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.560> quick

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.120 
stock I am looking into getting crane
stock<00:01:43.619> but<00:01:44.549> uh<00:01:45.200> that's<00:01:46.200> in<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.560> future<00:01:46.890> and

then<00:01:50.149> dot<00:01:51.149> scope<00:01:52.009> if<00:01:53.009> you're<00:01:53.250> wondering<00:01:53.399> why<00:01:53.610> I

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
then dot scope if you're wondering why I

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.870 
then dot scope if you're wondering why I
have<00:01:53.820> my<00:01:53.850> red<00:01:54.840> dot<00:01:55.079> like<00:01:55.409> this<00:01:55.680> it's<00:01:55.979> because<00:01:56.790> I

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
have my red dot like this it's because I

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.219 
have my red dot like this it's because I
have<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.119> have<00:01:57.329> it<00:01:57.479> mounted<00:01:57.600> like<00:01:57.899> that<00:01:58.110> or

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
have to have it mounted like that or

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.600 
have to have it mounted like that or
else<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.439> can't<00:01:58.649> see<00:01:58.799> over<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.070> PEC<00:01:59.250> too<00:01:59.430> and

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
else you can't see over the PEC too and

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.800 
else you can't see over the PEC too and
I<00:01:59.640> know<00:01:59.670> what<00:01:59.880> you're<00:02:00.000> thinking<00:02:00.299> why<00:02:00.750> don't

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
I know what you're thinking why don't

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.469 
I know what you're thinking why don't
you<00:02:01.020> just<00:02:01.170> put<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.500> PO<00:02:01.680> box<00:02:01.979> on<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.369> side<00:02:02.579> well

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
you just put the PO box on the side well

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.389 
you just put the PO box on the side well
I<00:02:03.509> i<00:02:04.079> don't<00:02:04.409> really<00:02:04.560> like<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.979> look<00:02:05.070> of<00:02:05.219> that<00:02:05.280> I

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
I i don't really like the look of that I

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.639 
I i don't really like the look of that I
tried<00:02:05.759> it<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:05.939> it<00:02:06.299> just<00:02:06.869> didn't<00:02:07.350> look<00:02:07.380> that

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
tried it and it just didn't look that

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.150 
tried it and it just didn't look that
great<00:02:07.829> so<00:02:08.580> if<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:09.660> had<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:10.110> modify<00:02:10.470> my<00:02:10.830> scope<00:02:11.069> a

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
great so if I had to modify my scope a

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.920 
great so if I had to modify my scope a
little<00:02:11.370> bit<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.700> make<00:02:11.970> it<00:02:12.030> see<00:02:12.450> over<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.780> peg

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
little bit to make it see over the peg

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.340 
little bit to make it see over the peg
box

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350

do<00:02:14.040> get<00:02:14.310> it<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.670> where<00:02:14.970> I<00:02:15.000> want<00:02:15.270> it<00:02:15.330> then<00:02:15.390> that's

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
do get it to where I want it then that's

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.620 
do get it to where I want it then that's
just<00:02:15.780> fine<00:02:16.080> with<00:02:16.140> me<00:02:17.060> it's<00:02:18.060> not<00:02:18.180> loose<00:02:18.450> or

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
just fine with me it's not loose or

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.200 
just fine with me it's not loose or
anything<00:02:18.930> it's<00:02:19.710> on<00:02:19.830> there<00:02:20.010> pretty<00:02:20.160> tight<00:02:20.430> see
