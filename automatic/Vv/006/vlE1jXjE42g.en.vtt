00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.080
 hello friends today we're going to work from 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:10.610
 strengthening for the shadow no longer 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.870
 We have jobs in 10 days jobs 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.849
 that will lead us to improve strength 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.849
 but those Saturdays that we are going to do well 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.949
 where are we going to learn some 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.289
 exercises with bars that can be 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:29.630
 to clearly strengthen the light 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:33.470
 that we are going to work whatever you want 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:36.300
 back your back you are going to look for a seat 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:39.150
 and you are going to jump good posture of the 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.120
 back sitting down and let's do little 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:45.570
 reverence and forward and then I'll 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.370
 to climb again this forward and 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.590
 up always looking for that chest 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.180
 be open and that the work is going 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.670
 from the lumbar with this exercise that 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.230
 let's focus fully on the 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.760
 lumbar without working muscles 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.890
 it's the first second decision exercise 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.530
 that we are going to work for today 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.080
 when the same work is done 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.060
 we are going to use only the start 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.070
 let's always work with the legs 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.870
 we are going to sit 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.830
 Navarre 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:19.720
 Back back really places legs 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.910
 separated and this is an exercise that 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.930
 the Russians practice quite a lot because he's going to 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:28.170
 help improve the strength to lower 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.170
 again 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.190
 that always maintaining good posture 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:40.100
 of the chest head up and knees 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:44.900
 stretched we can work 6 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:47.090
 and 15 repetitions 45 series according to how 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.009
 you are climbing and feeling the weight what 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.200
 important is always to maintain a very 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.570
 good posture always work from the 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.580
 lumbar area and sure we will improve 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.290
 our strength in that specific area 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:01.750
 a new practice two exercises 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.340
 and already with that more insufficient we see 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.320
 on another occasion with another next 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.320
 strengthening video thanks
