00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
things that target that's where we were

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.240 
things that target that's where we were
weak<00:02:36.590> but<00:02:36.950> follow<00:02:37.940> we<00:02:38.569> played<00:02:39.349> well<00:02:39.560> and<00:02:39.829> made

thought<00:02:42.769> very<00:02:43.400> good<00:02:43.730> athletes<00:02:44.209> at<00:02:44.480> receiver

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:45.079 
thought very good athletes at receiver

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:47.020 
thought very good athletes at receiver
that<00:02:45.319> could<00:02:45.470> do<00:02:45.560> some<00:02:45.769> things<00:02:46.010> tell<00:02:46.760> me<00:02:46.850> more

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
that could do some things tell me more

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
their receiver corps and our secondary

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.500 
their receiver corps and our secondary
um<00:02:51.109> well<00:02:52.040> I<00:02:52.340> mean<00:02:52.549> they<00:02:52.670> kept<00:02:52.850> the<00:02:53.299> kit

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
um well I mean they kept the kit

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.900 
um well I mean they kept the kit
catching<00:02:54.019> us<00:02:54.109> in<00:02:54.260> pressure<00:02:54.829> which<00:02:55.489> kind<00:02:55.850> of

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
catching us in pressure which kind of

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.030 
catching us in pressure which kind of
isolated<00:02:56.720> some<00:02:56.959> guys<00:02:57.170> and<00:02:57.650> they<00:02:57.739> made<00:02:57.889> some

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
isolated some guys and they made some

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.840 
isolated some guys and they made some
plays<00:02:58.250> on<00:02:58.579> some<00:02:59.510> man<00:02:59.690> coverage<00:02:59.900> beaters

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
plays on some man coverage beaters

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.150 
plays on some man coverage beaters
just<00:03:01.660> tough<00:03:01.870> place<00:03:02.050> to<00:03:02.080> make<00:03:02.880> more<00:03:05.070> apart<00:03:06.070> from

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
just tough place to make more apart from

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.970 
just tough place to make more apart from
that<00:03:06.250> I<00:03:06.670> thought<00:03:06.880> a<00:03:07.260> one<00:03:08.260> ball<00:03:08.470> up<00:03:08.710> in<00:03:08.860> the<00:03:08.890> air

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
that I thought a one ball up in the air

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.430 
that I thought a one ball up in the air
that<00:03:09.130> we<00:03:09.370> could<00:03:09.520> have<00:03:09.580> made<00:03:09.730> a<00:03:09.790> play<00:03:10.060> on<00:03:10.240> but<00:03:10.660> I

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
that we could have made a play on but I

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.640 
that we could have made a play on but I
mean<00:03:12.130> I<00:03:12.400> didn't<00:03:12.790> think<00:03:12.880> their<00:03:13.320> receivers<00:03:14.320> did

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
mean I didn't think their receivers did

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.230 
mean I didn't think their receivers did
anything<00:03:14.890> that<00:03:15.040> killed<00:03:15.340> us<00:03:15.520> it's<00:03:15.730> just<00:03:15.790> we

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 
anything that killed us it's just we

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.300 
anything that killed us it's just we
needed<00:03:16.450> to<00:03:16.680> we<00:03:17.680> got<00:03:17.830> a<00:03:17.860> little<00:03:18.040> bit<00:03:18.190> excited

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
needed to we got a little bit excited

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.920 
needed to we got a little bit excited
out<00:03:18.700> on<00:03:18.850> the<00:03:18.940> perimeter<00:03:19.060> we<00:03:19.570> need<00:03:19.690> to<00:03:19.750> break

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
out on the perimeter we need to break

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.660 
out on the perimeter we need to break
down<00:03:20.080> make<00:03:20.350> some<00:03:20.380> tackles<00:03:21.100> fly<00:03:21.310> around<00:03:21.460> a

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
down make some tackles fly around a

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.480 
down make some tackles fly around a
little<00:03:21.790> bit<00:03:21.940> better<00:03:22.120> but<00:03:22.420> apart<00:03:23.230> from<00:03:23.260> that

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 
little bit better but apart from that

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.340 
little bit better but apart from that

on our blocking special block and it
also<00:04:32.620> passes<00:04:32.950> but<00:04:33.820> I'm<00:04:33.970> in<00:04:34.090> general<00:04:34.360> I<00:04:34.390> thought

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
also passes but I'm in general I thought

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.210 
also passes but I'm in general I thought
we<00:04:34.600> did<00:04:34.720> great<00:04:34.810> we<00:04:35.380> still<00:04:35.590> could<00:04:35.740> still<00:04:35.980> a<00:04:36.010> lot

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.460 
we did great we still could still a lot
to<00:04:36.250> get<00:04:36.730> better<00:04:36.910> at<00:04:37.120> but<00:04:37.630> overall<00:04:37.900> we're<00:04:38.320> doing

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470
