00:00:01.219 --> 00:00:04.250
 about what is morning hours 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.250
 when the first time but then 

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:12.999
 full prostration dust 

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:15.669
 there was a feeling that they did not score 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:17.810
 there is no shortage after 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.810
 of all this abundance we went back 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:24.589
 what now 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:26.249
 in particular 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:27.469
 what space are we from 

00:00:27.469 --> 00:00:28.979
 believe now 

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:31.060
 about what means separation 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.420
 overdue growth that's not all that got 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.500
 that is, they will not come back there 4 and 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.500
 restore the death penalty 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.630
 if capable 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:44.870
 just follow 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.980
 why do you dream tea coincides 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.360
 how does it differ though do it 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.460
 in early June think about how 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.620
 it will happen 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.220
 the first thing that started our dream 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.980
 we have our desire left 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.640
 if we sincerely wish 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.770
 after which r 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.570
 and not because there is no 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.370
 or because losing this period 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.280
 but just want 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.650
 funds were such pictures 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.390
 I generally think that before ipo Yandex 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.250
 Yes it's true 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.470
 we just let you combine 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.250
 first cartoons and burned out worth 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.090
 summer 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.790
 well it was calmer more vigorously that that 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.289
 or eyes just the trouble is that period 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:27.189
 fk news 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:28.469
 two young men 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:31.930
 vessel 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.300
 paying attention and beyond 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.820
 it denies 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.090
 in general, almost every Orthodox 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.010
 Besides 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.060
 unpleasant 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.140
 and the villages are treated differently 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.930
 press attache way behind the bazaar man because 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.150
 the delays on the first violins are worn 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.560
 we asked 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.930
 and just let go 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.600
 so that traumas were open here 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.600
 will happen 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.000
 husband is a dream 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.590
 nothing dream of izmir language 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.610
 in which the lifetime of my life 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:07.120
 there is 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.050
 for all I want it I am not mistaken 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.540
 space where everything is of course nothing 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.289
 got from the desert activists 

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:17.159
 some people already have decent 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:19.789
 implementations that I want 

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:21.979
 now it turns out that this time I donâ€™t 

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:23.579
 made 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:24.599
 because it did 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.139
 manufacturer see here 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:28.619
 Vasily Serebryakov 

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:30.840
 major goods producer companies 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.949
 and as they say 

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:35.549
 who knows what they haven't done yet 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.429
 it is so crucial 

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:40.719
 Dream Oleg Vyacheslav gmbh 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:42.920
 project site people 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.920
 in fact so I just like that 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:47.879
 in Russia 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:50.819
 manufacturers want to have a ferry 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.259
 no bargaining 

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:56.329
 your dream about the right product 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:58.239
 now buy more for this 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.999
 do use 

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:03.419
 need to say 

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:04.869
 you can release a magazine right now 

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:06.649
 legalization 

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:08.439
 now the producers themselves 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:11.519
 According to salami, I am grateful 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.340
 the slogan the plane itself with the second 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.629
 so strong I tried to avoid 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:19.779
 trips 

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:22.799
 in fact these people who are generally and 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.069
 networked 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:28.469
 That is 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:30.229
 he thinks he lets not let 

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:31.599
 next 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.099
 if you look at the magnetic list 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:36.319
 than 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:38.869
 the reason for this was due to 

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:41.469
 let's see what happens 

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:44.389
 this way 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:45.909
 I just need five years 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:48.909
 i.e. 15 days in front of yourself 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:53.219
 there are different sentences 

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:56.219
 this bet 

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:04.999
 such that the autocad mathcad area virus 

00:04:04.999 --> 00:04:07.999
 because 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:15.840
 read bridge 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.840
 It is aimed at damage year 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.439
 dates of them 

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:28.349
 in which I live 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:30.379
 4 create spaces 

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:33.469
 Petrovich did not come 

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:35.449
 this is life about preparing a holiday 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:37.299
 consumer goods fuel 

00:04:37.299 --> 00:04:38.059
 100 km 

00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:39.319
 a machine 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:41.029
 a year has passed 

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:42.630
 Egorov Margrethe P g 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:43.569
 speaker 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:45.389
 but each 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:46.520
 it is too early 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.639
 This investigation which 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:50.539
 conducted 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:52.599
 headquarters 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:54.179
 because if you just start and 

00:04:54.179 --> 00:04:55.319
 trace 

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:57.029
 don't bother 

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:58.719
 if to me personally 

00:04:58.719 --> 00:05:00.689
 not scared of winning one line 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:02.319
 threw washers 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:04.499
 also difficult to say he hopes that 

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:08.479
 Russia all the same taxes and 4 Obama and I 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:10.969
 unusual i am generally against 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:13.990
 and how I don't know my places I agree 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.759
 I think it is on the one hand 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:17.960
 will be small 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.539
 fires with architecture failure 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:23.539
 can relax 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:27.289
 on the counters 2009 2010 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:29.740

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.330
 to 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.330
 I wanted to wish 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.460
 what is this invitation 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.750
 ask a question japanese question creates 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.750
 space 

00:06:14.369 --> 00:06:17.369
 20 years later 

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:22.099
 principle g 

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:24.809
 Minister of expression 

00:06:24.809 --> 00:06:27.809
 at the trench stage 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:30.659
 what is the intestines 

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:33.069
 so what to do 

00:06:33.069 --> 00:06:35.020
 a computer without a roof 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.719
 can provide 

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:39.520
 gamers can play this score 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.520
 if that account 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:44.900
 at the exhibition 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.330
 another question and what is just a part 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.379
 Here you have such a big 

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:54.309
 on this day 

00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:55.319
 what is it about yourself
