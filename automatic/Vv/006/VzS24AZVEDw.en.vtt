branched-chain amino acid powder tastes
really<00:00:50.749> good<00:00:50.960> you<00:00:51.139> could<00:00:51.260> take<00:00:51.409> it<00:00:51.530> before<00:00:51.649> the

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
really good you could take it before the

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.459 
really good you could take it before the
workout<00:00:52.399> during<00:00:53.030> the<00:00:53.210> workout<00:00:53.440> after<00:00:54.440> the

throughout the day amino core is great i

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.879 
throughout the day amino core is great i
mean<00:00:59.209> i<00:00:59.359> would<00:00:59.569> think<00:00:59.749> there's<00:01:00.199> there's<00:01:00.679> so

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:00.889 
mean i would think there's there's so

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:02.889 
mean i would think there's there's so
many<00:01:01.039> things<00:01:01.190> that<00:01:01.659> differentiate<00:01:02.659> and<00:01:02.809> one

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
many things that differentiate and one

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:04.539 
many things that differentiate and one

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
the the amino acids that we use are

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.870 
the the amino acids that we use are
freeze-dried<00:01:23.830> that<00:01:24.830> it<00:01:24.950> is<00:01:25.040> a<00:01:25.070> pure<00:01:25.370> amino

freeze-dried that it is a pure amino
acid<00:01:26.330> product<00:01:26.840> there<00:01:27.710> are<00:01:27.800> some<00:01:27.950> products<00:01:28.250> out

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
acid product there are some products out

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.040 
acid product there are some products out
there<00:01:28.430> that<00:01:28.610> have<00:01:28.940> other<00:01:29.210> aminos<00:01:29.660> in<00:01:29.870> there

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
there that have other aminos in there

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.920 
there that have other aminos in there
and<00:01:30.230> try<00:01:30.890> to<00:01:30.920> sort<00:01:31.310> of<00:01:31.430> indicate<00:01:32.210> that<00:01:32.240> they

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
and try to sort of indicate that they

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.390 
and try to sort of indicate that they
are<00:01:32.960> branched<00:01:33.440> chain<00:01:33.530> amino<00:01:33.560> acid<00:01:34.070> products

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
are branched chain amino acid products

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.340 
are branched chain amino acid products
so<00:01:34.460> we're<00:01:34.580> very<00:01:34.610> proud<00:01:35.060> of<00:01:35.120> the<00:01:35.330> fact<00:01:35.540> that<00:01:35.780> not

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
so we're very proud of the fact that not

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.260 
so we're very proud of the fact that not
only<00:01:36.440> is<00:01:36.560> the<00:01:36.740> highest<00:01:37.010> quality<00:01:37.160> aminos<00:01:37.820> but

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
only is the highest quality aminos but

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.700 
only is the highest quality aminos but
they're<00:01:38.420> fully<00:01:38.660> into<00:01:38.900> ties<00:01:39.140> which<00:01:39.350> means<00:01:39.560> they

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
they're fully into ties which means they

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.670 
they're fully into ties which means they
mix<00:01:40.100> perfectly<00:01:40.670> and<00:01:40.880> you<00:01:41.630> get<00:01:42.050> all<00:01:42.290> of<00:01:42.500> the

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
mix perfectly and you get all of the

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.580 
mix perfectly and you get all of the

you try to drink it the other thing as
you<00:01:50.900> mentioned<00:01:51.260> we<00:01:51.290> have<00:01:51.620> very<00:01:52.250> highly

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
you mentioned we have very highly

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.940 
you mentioned we have very highly
bioavailable<00:01:52.790> b<00:01:53.420> vitamins<00:01:53.900> which<00:01:54.350> makes<00:01:54.620> sure

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
bioavailable b vitamins which makes sure

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.610 
bioavailable b vitamins which makes sure
that<00:01:55.220> your<00:01:55.520> body<00:01:55.790> is<00:01:55.940> in<00:01:56.210> the<00:01:56.240> proper<00:01:56.620> anabolic

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
that your body is in the proper anabolic

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.800 
that your body is in the proper anabolic
state<00:01:57.950> in<00:01:58.220> order<00:01:58.580> to<00:01:58.850> build<00:01:59.150> muscle<00:01:59.659> and

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
state in order to build muscle and

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.020 
state in order to build muscle and
prevent<00:02:00.560> catabolism<00:02:01.100> and<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:01.700> other<00:02:01.820> thing

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
prevent catabolism and the other thing

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.850 
prevent catabolism and the other thing
you<00:02:02.060> mentioned<00:02:02.240> is<00:02:02.479> the<00:02:02.510> alpha<00:02:02.900> k<00:02:03.080> IC<00:02:03.440> which<00:02:03.680> is

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
you mentioned is the alpha k IC which is

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.350 
you mentioned is the alpha k IC which is
the<00:02:03.950> key<00:02:04.100> toys<00:02:04.310> and<00:02:04.490> caproic<00:02:04.729> acid<00:02:04.850> a

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
the key toys and caproic acid a

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.050 
the key toys and caproic acid a
downstream<00:02:06.290> metete<00:02:06.710> metabolite<00:02:07.310> of<00:02:07.430> leucine

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
downstream metete metabolite of leucine

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.990 
downstream metete metabolite of leucine
so<00:02:08.360> it's<00:02:08.569> the<00:02:08.750> Keogh<00:02:09.019> acid<00:02:09.530> of<00:02:09.709> leucine

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
so it's the Keogh acid of leucine

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.640 
so it's the Keogh acid of leucine
important<00:02:11.420> thing<00:02:11.630> for<00:02:11.660> the<00:02:11.960> consumer<00:02:12.380> about

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
important thing for the consumer about

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.050 
important thing for the consumer about
that<00:02:12.860> is<00:02:13.100> that<00:02:13.370> having<00:02:14.210> that<00:02:14.500> kic<00:02:15.500> in<00:02:15.620> the<00:02:15.710> body

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
that is that having that kic in the body

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.280 
that is that having that kic in the body
allows<00:02:17.060> it<00:02:17.210> to<00:02:17.240> go<00:02:17.390> to<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:17.600> muscle<00:02:17.900> cell<00:02:18.110> and

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
allows it to go to the muscle cell and

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.100 
allows it to go to the muscle cell and
it's<00:02:18.650> a<00:02:18.740> reversible<00:02:19.370> process<00:02:19.520> so<00:02:20.420> it<00:02:20.750> turns

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
it's a reversible process so it turns

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.700 
it's a reversible process so it turns
into<00:02:21.380> leucine<00:02:22.310> at<00:02:22.550> the<00:02:22.700> muscle<00:02:23.030> site<00:02:23.240> and<00:02:23.710> and

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
into leucine at the muscle site and and

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.530 
into leucine at the muscle site and and
of<00:02:24.950> course<00:02:24.980> it<00:02:25.280> also<00:02:25.400> breaks<00:02:25.880> down<00:02:26.090> from

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
of course it also breaks down from

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.870 
of course it also breaks down from
leucine<00:02:27.290> so<00:02:27.440> you<00:02:27.530> get<00:02:27.740> this<00:02:27.860> recycling<00:02:28.459> effect

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
leucine so you get this recycling effect

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.270 
leucine so you get this recycling effect
where<00:02:29.240> you<00:02:29.330> have<00:02:29.510> more<00:02:29.810> leucine<00:02:30.320> close<00:02:30.980> to<00:02:31.160> the

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
where you have more leucine close to the

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.920 
where you have more leucine close to the
muscle<00:02:31.580> cell<00:02:31.790> where<00:02:32.270> it<00:02:32.390> needs<00:02:32.540> to<00:02:32.660> be<00:02:32.750> to

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
muscle cell where it needs to be to

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.440 
muscle cell where it needs to be to
create<00:02:33.110> that<00:02:33.260> edible<00:02:33.560> except<00:02:34.010> effect<00:02:34.640> and

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
create that edible except effect and

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:36.880 
create that edible except effect and
what<00:02:35.570> you<00:02:35.720> mentioned<00:02:35.930> to<00:02:36.260> which<00:02:36.440> I<00:02:36.560> like<00:02:36.740> a<00:02:36.770> lot

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
what you mentioned to which I like a lot

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.460 
what you mentioned to which I like a lot
is<00:02:37.250> when<00:02:37.760> you<00:02:37.850> take<00:02:38.090> a<00:02:38.120> Munich<00:02:38.540> or<00:02:38.750> with<00:02:39.290> the

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
is when you take a Munich or with the

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.680 
is when you take a Munich or with the
key<00:02:39.709> to<00:02:39.830> Isaac<00:02:40.130> a<00:02:40.190> pro<00:02:40.370> at<00:02:40.520> Gaston<00:02:40.910> it<00:02:41.390> alerts

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
key to Isaac a pro at Gaston it alerts

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.630 
key to Isaac a pro at Gaston it alerts
the<00:02:41.900> muscle<00:02:42.350> cell<00:02:42.530> that<00:02:42.950> there's<00:02:43.220> all<00:02:43.489> this

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
the muscle cell that there's all this

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.970 
the muscle cell that there's all this
anabolic<00:02:44.180> building<00:02:44.540> material<00:02:44.989> so<00:02:45.500> it's<00:02:45.680> more

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
anabolic building material so it's more

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.680 
anabolic building material so it's more
or<00:02:46.100> less<00:02:46.130> hey<00:02:46.489> let's<00:02:46.790> increase<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.330> size<00:02:47.540> of

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
or less hey let's increase the size of

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.630 
or less hey let's increase the size of
the<00:02:47.750> muscle<00:02:48.080> cell<00:02:48.260> let's<00:02:48.410> repair<00:02:48.830> it<00:02:48.980> or<00:02:49.130> we're

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
the muscle cell let's repair it or we're

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.220 
the muscle cell let's repair it or we're
compensate<00:02:50.150> from<00:02:50.360> this<00:02:50.480> workout<00:02:50.870> that<00:02:51.050> we've

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
compensate from this workout that we've

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.229 
compensate from this workout that we've
had<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:52.010> workout<00:02:52.340> from<00:02:52.520> the<00:02:52.640> previous<00:02:53.030> day<00:02:53.209> I

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
had the workout from the previous day I

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.720 
had the workout from the previous day I
like<00:02:53.750> that<00:02:53.900> insight<00:02:54.260> so<00:02:54.440> basically<00:02:55.250> it<00:02:55.430> alerts

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
like that insight so basically it alerts

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.550 
like that insight so basically it alerts
the<00:02:55.820> cell<00:02:56.120> that<00:02:56.300> you<00:02:56.420> have<00:02:56.690> these<00:02:56.930> antibiotic

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
building material the mtor pathway is

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.570 
building material the mtor pathway is
basically<00:03:00.290> directly<00:03:00.650> then<00:03:00.800> helps<00:03:01.070> synthesize

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
basically directly then helps synthesize

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.520 
basically directly then helps synthesize
all<00:03:01.610> these<00:03:02.000> amino<00:03:02.270> acids<00:03:02.660> to<00:03:03.050> repair<00:03:03.500> your

coenzymes those are going to help with a
proper<00:03:17.959> assimilation<00:03:18.680> and<00:03:18.830> I<00:03:19.160> always<00:03:19.400> say

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
proper assimilation and I always say

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.610 
proper assimilation and I always say
you're<00:03:19.940> not<00:03:20.090> just<00:03:20.360> what<00:03:20.510> you<00:03:20.540> eat<00:03:20.840> p<00:03:21.350> what<00:03:21.500> you

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
you're not just what you eat p what you

acids another thing is worth mentioning

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.780 
acids another thing is worth mentioning
is<00:03:38.870> that<00:03:38.900> the<00:03:39.260> ratio<00:03:39.560> of<00:03:39.860> molasses<00:03:40.489> that<00:03:40.640> we've

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
is that the ratio of molasses that we've

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.390 
is that the ratio of molasses that we've
used<00:03:41.120> is<00:03:41.360> the<00:03:41.690> thirty<00:03:42.260> five<00:03:42.500> thirty<00:03:42.920> twenty

five percent ratio the reason that's

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.710 
five percent ratio the reason that's
important<00:03:46.610> is<00:03:46.700> because<00:03:46.760> we<00:03:47.180> based<00:03:47.480> this

branch the amino acids we took very very
good<00:04:37.820> scientific<00:04:38.330> studies<00:04:38.750> and<00:04:38.960> we<00:04:39.020> made<00:04:39.169> sure

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 
good scientific studies and we made sure
