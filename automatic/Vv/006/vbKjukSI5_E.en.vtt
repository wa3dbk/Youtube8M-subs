00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 an extreme phylum is a microorganism that 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.170
 lives in conditions that are lethal to 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.970
 life these agencies have 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.190
 special features that 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.110
 allows to survive in environments that 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.940
 they would be totally lethal for the being 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.020
 human or other life forms in the 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.880
 land 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.410
 this time we will talk about a topic 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.050
 very interesting that is titled 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.680
 tardigrade the indestructible bear of 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.680
 Water 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.080
 let us begin 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:31.280
 the tardigrades were described by 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:33.620
 first time by johan august in 1773 the 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.420
 which he called them water bears and 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.540
 refers to the way in which 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.220
 they walk similar to the walk of a bear the 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.980
 water bears have characteristics 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.200
 unique in the animal kingdom such as 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.570
 to be able to survive in the vacuum of space 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.370
 as well as at very high pressures to the 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.590
 prolonged dehydration and 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.770
 ionizing radiation most of the 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.150
 tardigrades are terrestrial and live 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.700
 fundamentally in the layer of water that 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.410
 cover mosses and ferns though 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.620
 they can also inhabit waters 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.059
 ocean or fresh water basically this 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.070
 organism can inhabit any 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.440
 part of the world because of its great 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.450
 resistance the biggest adults 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.100
 they can be seen at a glance because 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.680
 they reach a point length 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.530
 approximately five millimeters are 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.720
 oval or elongated shape and are fed 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.640
 sucking liquids from vegetables or 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.410
 animals maybe the most quality 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.180
 fascinating of the tardigrades is their 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.250
 ability to enter a state of 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.020
 suspended animation known as 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.280
 crypto biosys in situations 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.280
 extreme environmental 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.130
 through a process of dehydration 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.740
 can go from having the usual 85% of 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:43.070
 body water to stay with just one 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.710
 3% in this state growth the 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.440
 reproduction and metabolism are reduced 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.899
 or they stop temporarily and so they can pass 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.210
 up to five years the tardigrades are 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.310
 formed by a thousand cells and some 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.740
 species keep the number constant 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.259
 of cells during their development in 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.800
 In September 2007 , the probe was launched 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:06.440
 spatial photon m3 of rusia and in it was 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.780
 placed a group of tardigrades 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.030
 found that not only survived the 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.100
 conditions of outer space but 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.739
 that they even maintained their ability 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.200
 reproductive reason why they are considered 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.900
 the toughest living being on the planet 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.850
 They can also support 100 times more 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.610
 radiation that living things more 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.410
 resistant and can spend years in a 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.750
 state of hibernation without water and 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.269
 reactivate as soon as they are supplied 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.910
 undoubtedly the tardigrades are organisms 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:37.190
 very surprising that make us think 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.040
 that maybe life on planet earth 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.469
 comes from 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.650
 as suggested by the theory of 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:42.650
 panspermia
