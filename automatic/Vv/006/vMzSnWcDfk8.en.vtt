you<00:01:24.420> kind<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.720> took<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.930> stretch<00:01:25.380> around<00:01:25.590> this

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:28.480 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.560 

we<00:01:29.170> got<00:01:29.320> a<00:01:29.350> new<00:01:29.560> kind<00:01:30.130> of<00:01:30.250> a<00:01:30.370> new<00:01:31.060> group<00:01:31.240> of<00:01:31.390> guys

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
important every game is last year is

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.770 
important every game is last year is
similar<00:01:39.580> position<00:01:40.030> with<00:01:40.180> two<00:01:40.300> teams<00:01:40.600> behind

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
position as well we can where we could

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.140
