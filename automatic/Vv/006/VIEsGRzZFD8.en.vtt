00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
on just make that on the slightly move

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.300 
on just make that on the slightly move
slide<00:01:26.020> so<00:01:26.320> it's<00:01:26.440> not<00:01:26.530> the<00:01:26.680> same<00:01:26.890> as<00:01:27.040> the<00:01:27.160> other

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
slide so it's not the same as the other

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:34.080 
slide so it's not the same as the other
person<00:01:31.860> just<00:01:32.860> rub<00:01:33.100> that<00:01:33.130> along<00:01:33.490> the<00:01:33.520> bumps<00:01:33.970> and

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
person just rub that along the bumps and

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.480 
person just rub that along the bumps and
the<00:01:34.210> paper<00:01:34.750> and<00:01:35.560> that<00:01:35.710> just<00:01:35.890> makes<00:01:36.040> it<00:01:36.190> so<00:01:36.250> much

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
the paper and that just makes it so much

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.550 
the paper and that just makes it so much
easier<00:01:36.790> you<00:01:37.479> get<00:01:37.630> a<00:01:37.660> lovely<00:01:38.020> straight<00:01:38.320> line

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
easier you get a lovely straight line

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.820 
easier you get a lovely straight line
that's<00:01:39.130> broken<00:01:40.140> so<00:01:41.140> much<00:01:41.290> of<00:01:41.440> it<00:01:41.470> doesn't<00:01:41.740> go

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
that's broken so much of it doesn't go

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:56.430 
that's broken so much of it doesn't go
all<00:01:42.040> the<00:01:42.070> way<00:01:42.250> along

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:03.760 

you

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.160 

okay<00:02:04.609> so<00:02:04.670> that's<00:02:05.030> the<00:02:05.180> painting<00:02:05.570> finished<00:02:08.170> as

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
okay so that's the painting finished as

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.719 
okay so that's the painting finished as
you<00:02:09.319> can<00:02:09.470> see<00:02:09.679> you<00:02:09.830> might<00:02:10.009> think<00:02:10.220> i<00:02:10.340> see<00:02:10.550> is

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
you can see you might think i see is

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.610 
you can see you might think i see is
really<00:02:11.120> complicated<00:02:11.510> and<00:02:12.080> you<00:02:12.140> think<00:02:12.319> I<00:02:12.379> can't

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
really complicated and you think I can't

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.160 
really complicated and you think I can't
do<00:02:12.890> that<00:02:13.190> don't<00:02:13.760> be<00:02:13.970> scared<00:02:14.030> this<00:02:14.900> scene<00:02:15.140> has

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
do that don't be scared this scene has

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.839 
do that don't be scared this scene has
got<00:02:15.319> so<00:02:15.650> much<00:02:15.860> going<00:02:16.190> on<00:02:16.310> in<00:02:16.459> it<00:02:16.580> and<00:02:16.760> we

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
got so much going on in it and we

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.880 
got so much going on in it and we
simplified<00:02:17.450> it<00:02:17.629> right<00:02:17.900> down<00:02:18.080> to<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:18.349> basics

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
simplified it right down to the basics

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.009 
simplified it right down to the basics
and<00:02:19.069> created<00:02:19.910> a<00:02:20.030> memory<00:02:20.450> that<00:02:20.629> you<00:02:20.690> could

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
and created a memory that you could

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.619 
and created a memory that you could
really<00:02:21.260> think<00:02:21.560> yes<00:02:21.950> I<00:02:22.099> was<00:02:22.400> there<00:02:22.430> I<00:02:22.849> remember

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629 
really think yes I was there I remember

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:26.349 
really think yes I was there I remember
the<00:02:23.750> atmosphere
