bit<00:02:53.770> higher<00:02:54.100> up<00:02:59.580> I'm<00:03:00.660> going<00:03:01.660> to<00:03:01.720> use<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:02.050> angle

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
bit higher up I'm going to use the angle

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.260

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.180 
brush with a black or a dark brown
eyeshadow<00:03:04.330> I'm<00:03:05.080> going<00:03:05.290> to<00:03:05.350> turn<00:03:05.530> the<00:03:05.740> brush<00:03:05.920> so

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
eyeshadow I'm going to turn the brush so

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.610 
eyeshadow I'm going to turn the brush so
the<00:03:06.310> angles<00:03:06.760> facing<00:03:07.150> that<00:03:07.240> way<00:03:07.420> and<00:03:07.690> then<00:03:08.350> I'm

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
the angles facing that way and then I'm

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.820 
the angles facing that way and then I'm
going<00:03:09.190> to<00:03:09.250> use<00:03:09.550> it<00:03:09.820> to<00:03:10.570> pull<00:03:10.990> back<00:03:12.390> on<00:03:13.390> the<00:03:13.660> eye

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
going to use it to pull back on the eye

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.640
