factors got fast down at coit and

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.380 
factors got fast down at coit and
neither<00:03:50.570> is<00:03:50.660> Kyrie<00:03:51.140> Irving<00:03:51.470> but<00:03:52.310> um<00:03:52.490> Steph<00:03:53.240> is

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:57.710 
i think that the bronze problem had to

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.860 
i think that the bronze problem had to
be<00:03:57.800> dealt<00:03:57.950> a<00:03:58.250> blow<00:03:58.310> for<00:03:58.790> to<00:03:58.970> contain<00:03:59.630> him

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
be dealt a blow for to contain him

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.090 
be dealt a blow for to contain him
