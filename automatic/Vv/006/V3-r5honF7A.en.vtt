walk to the train station and then take

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.650 
walk to the train station and then take
the<00:00:41.610> train<00:00:41.850> there<00:00:42.860> we'll<00:00:43.860> see<00:00:44.329> so<00:00:45.329> when

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
unforeseeable circumstances occur and

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.690 
unforeseeable circumstances occur and
you<00:00:47.969> will<00:00:48.149> be<00:00:48.300> late<00:00:49.129> you<00:00:50.129> call<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.520> company

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
you will be late you call the company

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.369 
you will be late you call the company
and<00:00:51.090> then<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.420> company<00:00:51.629> calls<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.140> school

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
and then the company calls the school

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.450 
and then the company calls the school
tells<00:00:52.710> them<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:52.890> you're<00:00:53.070> going<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.219> be<00:00:53.309> like

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
tells them that you're going to be like

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.270 
tells them that you're going to be like
see<00:00:54.360> it's<00:00:54.660> really<00:00:55.320> roundabout<00:00:55.860> way<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.010> going

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
see it's really roundabout way of going

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.060 
see it's really roundabout way of going
about<00:00:56.399> things<00:00:56.610> but<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.770> sort<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.800> makes<00:00:58.949> it

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
about things but it sort of makes it

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.930 
about things but it sort of makes it
easier<00:00:59.430> because<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.359> don't<00:01:00.539> have<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.870> speak<00:01:01.680> in

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
easier because I don't have to speak in

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.039 
easier because I don't have to speak in

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.240 
and they probably have to be at school
there<00:02:09.290> to<00:02:09.380> be<00:02:09.470> at<00:02:09.530> school<00:02:09.560> earlier<00:02:10.009> than<00:02:10.190> I

totally<00:02:26.620> it's<00:02:27.620> kind<00:02:27.830> of<00:02:27.860> funny<00:02:28.040> to<00:02:28.130> think<00:02:28.250> that

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
totally it's kind of funny to think that

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.850
