g'day<00:00:16.250> the<00:00:17.250> purpose<00:00:17.609> of<00:00:17.789> this<00:00:17.910> video<00:00:18.270> is<00:00:18.330> to

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
g'day the purpose of this video is to

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.400 
g'day the purpose of this video is to
show<00:00:18.869> people<00:00:19.170> how<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.619> build<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:20.130> hydrogen<00:00:20.789> cell

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
show people how to build a hydrogen cell

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.870 
show people how to build a hydrogen cell
basically<00:00:22.410> there<00:00:22.920> are<00:00:22.949> many<00:00:23.250> different<00:00:23.670> types

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
basically there are many different types

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.570 
basically there are many different types
of<00:00:24.090> designs<00:00:24.859> I've<00:00:25.859> been<00:00:26.070> playing<00:00:26.310> with<00:00:26.490> this

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
of designs I've been playing with this

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.620 
of designs I've been playing with this
stuff<00:00:26.820> for<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.029> few<00:00:27.210> years<00:00:27.449> now<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:29.269> this<00:00:30.269> unit

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
stuff for a few years now and this unit

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.160 
stuff for a few years now and this unit
here<00:00:30.779> was<00:00:30.960> loaned<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.380> me<00:00:31.470> by<00:00:31.740> somebody<00:00:32.219> and

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
here was loaned to me by somebody and

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.330 
here was loaned to me by somebody and
observing<00:00:34.170> this<00:00:34.290> unit<00:00:34.710> compared<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.219> the

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
observing this unit compared to the

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.389 
observing this unit compared to the
stuff<00:00:35.640> I've<00:00:35.850> seen<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.360> played<00:00:36.570> with<00:00:37.190> at<00:00:38.190> this

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
stuff I've seen and played with at this

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.540 
stuff I've seen and played with at this
time<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.760> would<00:00:39.030> say<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.540> this<00:00:39.690> design<00:00:40.550> would

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
time I would say that this design would

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.400 
time I would say that this design would
be<00:00:41.700> probably<00:00:41.969> one<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.450> most<00:00:42.600> far<00:00:43.170> superior

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
be probably one of the most far superior

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.040 
be probably one of the most far superior
designs<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.610> easiest<00:00:44.940> designs<00:00:45.450> for<00:00:45.690> people

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
designs and easiest designs for people

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.470 
designs and easiest designs for people
to<00:00:46.170> build<00:00:46.850> there<00:00:47.850> are<00:00:47.940> many<00:00:48.090> different

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
to build there are many different

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.450 
to build there are many different
designs<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:49.170> there<00:00:49.829> are<00:00:49.890> many<00:00:50.039> different

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
designs and there are many different

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.209 
designs and there are many different
concepts<00:00:51.140> but<00:00:52.140> for<00:00:52.350> what<00:00:52.500> this<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.190> how

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
concepts but for what this is and how

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.959 
concepts but for what this is and how
easy<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:53.969> in<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.270> cost<00:00:54.510> effective<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.289> it

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
easy it is in the cost effective of it

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.790 
easy it is in the cost effective of it
for<00:00:56.969> me<00:00:57.120> if<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.510> was<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.809> recommend<00:00:58.109> anybody<00:00:58.530> to

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
for me if I was to recommend anybody to

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.220 
for me if I was to recommend anybody to
build<00:00:59.100> any<00:00:59.309> hydrogen<00:01:00.239> cells<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:00.930> will<00:01:01.020> tell

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
build any hydrogen cells that will tell

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.380 
build any hydrogen cells that will tell
them<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.350> build<00:01:01.559> this<00:01:01.770> one<00:01:01.949> as<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:02.850> can<00:01:03.059> see

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
them to build this one as you can see

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.500 
them to build this one as you can see
this<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:04.820> containing<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:06.000> just<00:01:06.210> buy<00:01:06.360> from

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
this is a containing you just buy from

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.240 
this is a containing you just buy from
the<00:01:06.630> secret<00:01:06.990> pocket<00:01:07.140> put<00:01:07.500> your<00:01:07.619> weet-bix<00:01:07.950> in

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
the secret pocket put your weet-bix in

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.609 
the secret pocket put your weet-bix in
or<00:01:08.600> drink<00:01:09.600> or<00:01:09.780> whatever<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.110> want<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.350> put<00:01:10.409> in

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
or drink or whatever you want to put in

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.390 
or drink or whatever you want to put in
I<00:01:10.740> suppose<00:01:12.260> these<00:01:13.260> are<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.500> bunch<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.830> tubes<00:01:14.159> in

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
I suppose these are a bunch of tubes in

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.609 
I suppose these are a bunch of tubes in
here<00:01:14.729> okay

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
here okay

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.590 
here okay
and<00:01:16.890> he's<00:01:17.100> using<00:01:17.369> chopping<00:01:17.939> board<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.479> you

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
and he's using chopping board that you

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.060 
and he's using chopping board that you
chop<00:01:18.780> your<00:01:18.930> vegetables<00:01:18.960> on<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.740> hold<00:01:19.890> those

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
chop your vegetables on to hold those

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.120 
chop your vegetables on to hold those
tubes<00:01:20.460> in<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:21.439> basically<00:01:22.439> all<00:01:22.560> those<00:01:22.680> tubes

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
tubes in and basically all those tubes

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.350 
tubes in and basically all those tubes
are<00:01:23.310> 3-1<00:01:23.520> 16<00:01:24.330> Mostel<00:01:25.400> okay<00:01:26.400> this<00:01:26.909> kind<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.210> runs

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
are 3-1 16 Mostel okay this kind of runs

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.940 
are 3-1 16 Mostel okay this kind of runs
through<00:01:27.600> really<00:01:27.840> quickly<00:01:28.200> on<00:01:28.439> how<00:01:28.619> this<00:01:28.770> was

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
through really quickly on how this was

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.190 
through really quickly on how this was
built<00:01:29.189> so<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.060> yourself<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:30.869> go<00:01:30.960> out<00:01:31.079> and

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
built so you yourself and go out and

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.630 
built so you yourself and go out and
build<00:01:31.320> one<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.650> these<00:01:31.770> yourself<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.460> we'll

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
build one of these yourself and we'll

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.310 
build one of these yourself and we'll
show<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:32.970> production<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.689> this<00:01:33.840> thing

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
show you the production of this thing

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.649 
show you the production of this thing
the<00:01:35.070> thing<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.400> like<00:01:35.640> about<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:36.060> cell<00:01:36.299> is<00:01:36.540> that

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
the thing I like about this cell is that

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.980 
the thing I like about this cell is that
I<00:01:36.840> think<00:01:37.079> it's<00:01:37.200> got<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.380> quite<00:01:37.590> good<00:01:37.909> production

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
I think it's got a quite good production

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.080 
I think it's got a quite good production
for<00:01:39.990> cell<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.890> doesn't<00:01:40.920> use<00:01:41.369> any<00:01:41.549> electrolyte

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
for cell it doesn't use any electrolyte

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.380 
for cell it doesn't use any electrolyte
it<00:01:42.570> just<00:01:43.200> uses<00:01:43.500> tap<00:01:43.710> water<00:01:43.950> only<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.610> if<00:01:45.270> you

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
it just uses tap water only and if you

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.899 
it just uses tap water only and if you
look<00:01:45.540> at<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.750> design<00:01:46.079> of<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.350> tubes<00:01:46.909> it's

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
look at the design of the tubes it's

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.030 
look at the design of the tubes it's
sort<00:01:48.180> of<00:01:48.299> half<00:01:48.479> based<00:01:48.810> on<00:01:49.079> what<00:01:49.380> Stanley<00:01:49.680> Meyer

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
sort of half based on what Stanley Meyer

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.959 
sort of half based on what Stanley Meyer
did<00:01:50.280> with<00:01:50.460> his<00:01:50.610> demonstration<00:01:51.600> cell<00:01:52.220> okay<00:01:53.220> so

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:58.520 

okay<00:01:56.969> we<00:01:57.299> flex<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.659> pull<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.020> cell<00:01:58.259> out<00:01:58.290> of

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
okay we flex you pull the cell out of

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.080 
okay we flex you pull the cell out of
the<00:01:58.590> container<00:01:58.979> here<00:01:59.250> just<00:01:59.549> for<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.759> show<00:02:00.060> you

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
the container here just for you show you

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.410 
the container here just for you show you
a<00:02:00.210> look<00:02:00.479> at<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:01.280> as<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.340> can<00:02:02.640> see<00:02:02.880> this<00:02:03.060> is<00:02:03.180> just

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
a look at it as you can see this is just

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.679 
a look at it as you can see this is just
normal<00:02:04.140> chopping<00:02:04.590> board<00:02:05.060> if<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.210> was<00:02:06.360> me<00:02:06.540> I'd

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
normal chopping board if it was me I'd

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.059 
normal chopping board if it was me I'd
gone<00:02:06.899> by<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.170> thick<00:02:07.469> piece<00:02:07.680> of<00:02:07.890> polycarbonate

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
gone by a thick piece of polycarbonate

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.520 
gone by a thick piece of polycarbonate
and<00:02:08.640> use<00:02:08.879> that<00:02:09.119> actually<00:02:10.050> find<00:02:10.440> the

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
and use that actually find the

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.140 
and use that actually find the
polycarbonate<00:02:11.009> is<00:02:11.340> pretty<00:02:11.520> good<00:02:11.700> insulator

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
polycarbonate is pretty good insulator

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.550 
polycarbonate is pretty good insulator
for<00:02:12.330> all<00:02:12.480> this<00:02:12.569> stuff

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
for all this stuff

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.740 
for all this stuff
and<00:02:13.819> these<00:02:14.819> are<00:02:15.000> just<00:02:15.180> basically<00:02:15.540> two<00:02:15.810> tubes

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
and these are just basically two tubes

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.790 
and these are just basically two tubes
size-wise<00:02:18.750> it<00:02:18.780> doesn't<00:02:19.260> matter<00:02:19.410> what<00:02:19.590> size

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
size-wise it doesn't matter what size

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.860 
size-wise it doesn't matter what size
you<00:02:20.010> use<00:02:20.220> as<00:02:20.730> long<00:02:20.760> as<00:02:20.970> you<00:02:21.090> get<00:02:21.239> the<00:02:21.330> two<00:02:21.540> tubes

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
you use as long as you get the two tubes

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.510 
you use as long as you get the two tubes
and<00:02:22.080> they're<00:02:22.230> within<00:02:22.380> say<00:02:22.739> three<00:02:23.099> ml<00:02:23.310> of<00:02:23.430> each

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
and they're within say three ml of each

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.050 
and they're within say three ml of each
other<00:02:25.099> I'd<00:02:26.099> say<00:02:26.340> these<00:02:26.520> tubes<00:02:26.880> around<00:02:27.209> about

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
other I'd say these tubes around about

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.229 
other I'd say these tubes around about
eight<00:02:30.060> inches<00:02:30.510> long<00:02:30.569> each<00:02:30.989> and<00:02:31.970> all<00:02:32.970> of<00:02:33.120> these

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
eight inches long each and all of these

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.009 
eight inches long each and all of these
outer<00:02:33.569> tubes<00:02:33.930> here<00:02:34.430> all<00:02:35.430> of<00:02:35.489> them<00:02:35.760> here<00:02:36.060> if<00:02:36.239> you

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
outer tubes here all of them here if you

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.250 
outer tubes here all of them here if you
if<00:02:37.260> you<00:02:37.380> look<00:02:37.620> here<00:02:37.950> they're<00:02:38.760> all<00:02:38.940> positive<00:02:39.269> so

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
if you look here they're all positive so

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.050 
if you look here they're all positive so
that's<00:02:40.440> positive<00:02:40.650> positive<00:02:41.489> positive

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
that's positive positive positive

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.900 
that's positive positive positive
positive<00:02:43.760> positive<00:02:45.049> in<00:02:46.049> there<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.910> positive

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
positive positive in there and positive

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.910 
positive positive in there and positive
on<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.180> outside<00:02:48.209> so<00:02:48.780> basically<00:02:49.170> every<00:02:49.620> tube

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
on the outside so basically every tube

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.050 
on the outside so basically every tube
is<00:02:50.100> positive<00:02:50.610> on<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.850> outside<00:02:51.299> and<00:02:52.700> each<00:02:53.700> tube

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
is positive on the outside and each tube

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.180 
is positive on the outside and each tube
on<00:02:54.239> the<00:02:54.330> inner<00:02:54.510> on<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:55.170> inside<00:02:55.560> it's<00:02:56.040> all

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
on the inner on the inside it's all

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.860 
on the inner on the inside it's all
negative<00:02:56.370> negative<00:02:57.090> negative<00:02:57.330> negative

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
negative negative negative negative

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.780 
negative negative negative negative
negative<00:02:58.260> and<00:02:58.799> so<00:02:58.980> on<00:02:59.160> okay

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
negative and so on okay

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.009 
negative and so on okay
so<00:03:00.769> very<00:03:01.769> simple<00:03:02.280> as<00:03:02.580> far<00:03:02.849> as<00:03:03.000> setting<00:03:03.810> up<00:03:03.930> a

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
so very simple as far as setting up a

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.800 
so very simple as far as setting up a
tubes<00:03:04.319> this<00:03:05.190> setup<00:03:05.459> here<00:03:05.760> is<00:03:05.940> just<00:03:06.180> how<00:03:06.330> he<00:03:06.360> set

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
tubes this setup here is just how he set

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.360 
tubes this setup here is just how he set
it<00:03:06.930> up<00:03:07.049> to<00:03:07.230> do<00:03:07.680> all<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:07.860> negative<00:03:08.220> and

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
it up to do all the negative and

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.940 
it up to do all the negative and
positive<00:03:08.400> tones<00:03:09.140> you<00:03:10.140> can<00:03:10.290> make<00:03:10.440> up<00:03:10.620> your<00:03:10.650> mind

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
positive tones you can make up your mind

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.530 
positive tones you can make up your mind
on<00:03:11.130> what<00:03:11.489> you<00:03:11.640> want<00:03:11.819> to<00:03:11.849> do<00:03:12.030> for<00:03:12.209> that<00:03:12.360> there's

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
on what you want to do for that there's

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.839 
on what you want to do for that there's
many<00:03:12.720> different<00:03:13.049> ways<00:03:13.170> of<00:03:13.319> doing<00:03:13.440> that<00:03:13.709> this<00:03:14.610> Y

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
many different ways of doing that this Y

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.520 
many different ways of doing that this Y
here<00:03:15.180> looks<00:03:15.420> like<00:03:15.510> a<00:03:15.630> stainless<00:03:16.110> steel<00:03:16.140> wire

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
here looks like a stainless steel wire

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.099 
here looks like a stainless steel wire
that<00:03:16.799> he's<00:03:16.950> pulled<00:03:17.190> off<00:03:17.310> a<00:03:17.370> fence<00:03:17.670> as<00:03:18.239> such<00:03:18.540> or

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
that he's pulled off a fence as such or

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:21.590 
that he's pulled off a fence as such or
railing<00:03:19.769> if<00:03:20.670> you've<00:03:20.850> seen<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.209> fancy

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
railing if you've seen the fancy

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.509 
railing if you've seen the fancy
stainless<00:03:22.019> steel<00:03:23.630> railing<00:03:24.650> why<00:03:25.650> they<00:03:25.950> use<00:03:26.310> on

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
stainless steel railing why they use on

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:31.819 
stainless steel railing why they use on
some<00:03:26.730> of<00:03:26.820> these<00:03:26.910> fancy<00:03:28.190> projects<00:03:29.190> they<00:03:29.280> do<00:03:30.829> so

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
some of these fancy projects they do so

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.530 
some of these fancy projects they do so
that's<00:03:32.010> about<00:03:32.130> all<00:03:32.250> I've<00:03:32.670> got<00:03:32.850> to<00:03:32.970> explain<00:03:33.359> on

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
that's about all I've got to explain on

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.599 
that's about all I've got to explain on
the<00:03:33.660> cell<00:03:33.870> it's<00:03:34.019> pretty<00:03:34.230> basic<00:03:34.470> and<00:03:34.890> match<00:03:35.430> to

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
the cell it's pretty basic and match to

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:37.039 
the cell it's pretty basic and match to
you<00:03:35.700> out<00:03:35.850> there<00:03:35.880> to<00:03:36.180> build<00:03:36.480> these<00:03:36.600> cells<00:03:36.930> you

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
you out there to build these cells you

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.559 
you out there to build these cells you
can<00:03:37.230> see<00:03:37.440> how<00:03:37.590> this<00:03:37.739> works<00:03:38.090> basically<00:03:39.090> this

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
can see how this works basically this

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.270 
can see how this works basically this
cell<00:03:39.810> we're<00:03:40.019> going<00:03:40.170> to<00:03:40.230> try<00:03:41.130> a<00:03:41.160> few

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
cell we're going to try a few

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.660 
cell we're going to try a few
experiments<00:03:42.150> on<00:03:42.359> behalf<00:03:42.600> of<00:03:42.780> panacea<00:03:43.489> we<00:03:44.489> want

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
experiments on behalf of panacea we want

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.750 
experiments on behalf of panacea we want
to<00:03:44.760> base<00:03:44.970> it<00:03:45.000> on<00:03:45.239> a<00:03:45.299> Dave<00:03:45.600> Wharton<00:03:46.049> cell<00:03:46.760> if

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
to base it on a Dave Wharton cell if

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.830 
to base it on a Dave Wharton cell if
this<00:03:47.970> was<00:03:48.180> my<00:03:48.420> water<00:03:49.230> cell<00:03:50.299> basically<00:03:51.299> if<00:03:51.720> I

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
this was my water cell basically if I

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.870 
this was my water cell basically if I
was<00:03:52.019> to<00:03:52.139> build<00:03:52.350> this<00:03:52.530> I'd<00:03:53.280> probably<00:03:53.519> build

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
was to build this I'd probably build

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.710 
was to build this I'd probably build
these<00:03:54.090> tubes<00:03:54.540> around<00:03:55.440> about<00:03:55.680> down<00:03:56.720> 600

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
these tubes around about down 600

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.379 
these tubes around about down 600
millimeters<00:03:58.230> to<00:03:58.380> meet<00:03:58.650> at<00:03:58.769> all<00:03:58.980> if<00:03:59.220> you<00:04:00.060> really

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
millimeters to meet at all if you really

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:02.840 
millimeters to meet at all if you really
want<00:04:00.600> to<00:04:00.690> be<00:04:01.350> serious<00:04:01.709> and<00:04:02.040> separate<00:04:02.519> the<00:04:02.700> men

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
want to be serious and separate the men

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.809 
want to be serious and separate the men
from<00:04:02.880> the<00:04:03.120> boys<00:04:03.680> I'd<00:04:04.680> be<00:04:04.889> making<00:04:05.040> meter<00:04:05.489> tubes

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
from the boys I'd be making meter tubes

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.870 
from the boys I'd be making meter tubes
basically<00:04:06.859> okay<00:04:07.859> it's<00:04:08.010> a<00:04:08.069> big<00:04:08.250> cell<00:04:08.519> I<00:04:08.549> know

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
basically okay it's a big cell I know

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.270 
basically okay it's a big cell I know
but<00:04:09.630> you're<00:04:10.380> going<00:04:10.530> to<00:04:10.620> see<00:04:10.799> in<00:04:10.920> a<00:04:11.010> minute<00:04:11.130> how

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
but you're going to see in a minute how

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.190 
but you're going to see in a minute how
much<00:04:11.549> hydrogen<00:04:11.850> production<00:04:12.450> that<00:04:12.840> this<00:04:12.989> thing

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
much hydrogen production that this thing

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.740 
much hydrogen production that this thing
makes<00:04:13.470> and<00:04:13.799> if<00:04:13.889> you<00:04:14.040> see<00:04:14.280> what<00:04:15.030> I<00:04:15.180> made<00:04:15.359> a<00:04:15.420> cell

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
makes and if you see what I made a cell

makes and if you see what I made a cell
would<00:04:15.959> do<00:04:16.200> you<00:04:16.950> never<00:04:17.220> need<00:04:17.430> to<00:04:17.459> put<00:04:17.700> an

would do you never need to put an

would do you never need to put an

electrolyte in you'd create the gas that

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.089 
electrolyte in you'd create the gas that
you<00:04:19.560> want<00:04:19.889> and<00:04:20.130> I<00:04:20.940> believe<00:04:21.269> you'd<00:04:21.630> also<00:04:21.810> have<00:04:22.380> a

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:23.099 
you want and I believe you'd also have a

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:25.250 
you want and I believe you'd also have a
different<00:04:23.880> frequency<00:04:24.060> in<00:04:24.539> the<00:04:24.630> water<00:04:24.840> by<00:04:25.050> not

different frequency in the water by not

different frequency in the water by not
using<00:04:25.440> electrolyte

using electrolyte

using electrolyte
anyway<00:04:27.510> we're<00:04:27.690> going<00:04:27.810> to<00:04:27.900> set<00:04:28.080> this<00:04:28.200> up<00:04:28.410> and

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
anyway we're going to set this up and

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.650 
anyway we're going to set this up and
give<00:04:29.400> you<00:04:29.490> a<00:04:29.520> demonstration<00:04:30.980> okay<00:04:31.980> basically

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
give you a demonstration okay basically

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.510 
give you a demonstration okay basically
we've<00:04:33.660> put<00:04:33.870> the<00:04:33.960> water<00:04:34.170> in<00:04:34.350> it<00:04:34.500> there<00:04:35.160> is<00:04:35.340> no

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
we've put the water in it there is no

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.250 
we've put the water in it there is no
electrolyte<00:04:36.120> and<00:04:36.300> this<00:04:36.420> is<00:04:36.600> a<00:04:36.630> straight<00:04:36.990> tap

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
electrolyte and this is a straight tap

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.540 
electrolyte and this is a straight tap
water<00:04:37.500> and<00:04:37.940> I'm<00:04:38.940> just<00:04:39.270> using<00:04:39.540> a<00:04:40.310> 12-volt<00:04:41.310> car

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
water and I'm just using a 12-volt car

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.820 
water and I'm just using a 12-volt car
battery<00:04:42.110> and<00:04:43.110> we're<00:04:43.350> just<00:04:43.530> going<00:04:43.650> to<00:04:43.680> hook

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
battery and we're just going to hook

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.490 
battery and we're just going to hook
this<00:04:43.980> up<00:04:44.450> now<00:04:45.450> I<00:04:45.480> haven't<00:04:45.690> got<00:04:45.810> a<00:04:45.900> multimeter

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
this up now I haven't got a multimeter

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.280 
this up now I haven't got a multimeter
to<00:04:46.680> measure<00:04:46.770> the<00:04:47.130> ends<00:04:47.370> at<00:04:47.490> this<00:04:47.640> time<00:04:48.290> the

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
to measure the ends at this time the

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.040 
to measure the ends at this time the
suspect<00:04:50.000> between<00:04:51.000> one<00:04:51.240> to<00:04:51.360> three<00:04:51.390> amps<00:04:51.930> this

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
suspect between one to three amps this

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.160 
suspect between one to three amps this
thing<00:04:52.290> would<00:04:52.470> chew<00:04:52.710> and<00:04:53.660> if<00:04:54.660> you<00:04:54.780> watch<00:04:54.960> the

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.170 
thing would chew and if you watch the

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.700 
thing would chew and if you watch the
gas<00:04:55.350> production<00:04:56.180> for<00:04:57.180> what<00:04:57.360> it<00:04:57.480> is<00:04:57.510> I<00:04:57.930> think

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
gas production for what it is I think

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.750 
gas production for what it is I think
it's<00:04:58.830> quite<00:04:58.950> rapid<00:05:01.070> for<00:05:02.070> the<00:05:02.160> actual<00:05:02.490> setup

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
it's quite rapid for the actual setup

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:09.380 
it's quite rapid for the actual setup
itself

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:17.390 

see<00:05:10.390> if<00:05:10.450> I<00:05:10.510> can<00:05:10.660> get<00:05:10.750> a<00:05:10.780> side<00:05:11.050> shot<00:05:11.080> Oh

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:30.920 

I<00:05:17.430> don't<00:05:18.120> know<00:05:18.210> what<00:05:18.600> you<00:05:18.750> can<00:05:18.900> see<00:05:19.110> that

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:45.720 

I'll<00:05:31.410> disconnect<00:05:31.860> that<00:05:32.100> at<00:05:32.639> all

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:45.730 

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.820 

okay<00:05:46.360> if<00:05:46.480> I<00:05:46.630> connect<00:05:46.930> the<00:05:47.020> power<00:05:47.200> terminal<00:05:47.710> up

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
okay if I connect the power terminal up

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.640 
okay if I connect the power terminal up
just<00:05:48.700> watch<00:05:48.880> how<00:05:49.150> instantly<00:05:49.690> it<00:05:49.900> dumb<00:05:50.170> turns

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
just watch how instantly it dumb turns

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:58.580 
just watch how instantly it dumb turns
on<00:05:50.830> again

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:03.650 

now<00:05:59.460> with<00:05:59.940> Dave<00:06:00.810> Lawton<00:06:01.290> some<00:06:01.680> circuit<00:06:02.660> or

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 
now with Dave Lawton some circuit or

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.890 
now with Dave Lawton some circuit or
Stanley<00:06:04.169> Meyer<00:06:04.380> circuit<00:06:04.950> I<00:06:05.360> believe<00:06:06.360> this

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
Stanley Meyer circuit I believe this

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.510 
Stanley Meyer circuit I believe this
gas<00:06:07.430> production<00:06:08.430> would<00:06:08.760> be<00:06:08.940> quite<00:06:09.660> more

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
gas production would be quite more

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.480 
gas production would be quite more
productive<00:06:11.520> again<00:06:12.680> if<00:06:13.680> it<00:06:13.860> was<00:06:13.980> all<00:06:14.130> set<00:06:14.370> up

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
productive again if it was all set up

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.330 
productive again if it was all set up
right<00:06:15.169> based<00:06:16.169> on<00:06:16.380> what<00:06:16.590> Russia<00:06:16.740> has<00:06:16.950> done<00:06:17.070> in

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
right based on what Russia has done in

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:24.629 
right based on what Russia has done in
India

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:24.639 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:31.499 

beautiful<00:06:25.629> milky<00:06:28.650> top<00:06:29.909> which<00:06:30.909> I<00:06:31.090> don't<00:06:31.300> see

00:06:31.499 --> 00:06:31.509 
beautiful milky top which I don't see

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:34.769 
beautiful milky top which I don't see
this<00:06:31.780> with<00:06:32.409> the<00:06:32.530> letter<00:06:32.740> light<00:06:33.419> the<00:06:34.419> waters

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:34.779

sort of stays clean for a lot longer and

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:41.610 
sort of stays clean for a lot longer and
you<00:06:39.279> probably<00:06:39.550> won't<00:06:39.729> see<00:06:39.849> this<00:06:40.029> but<00:06:40.479> this<00:06:40.629> a

you probably won't see this but this a
lot<00:06:41.979> of<00:06:42.009> folk<00:06:42.310> coming<00:06:42.580> off<00:06:42.759> the<00:06:42.909> top<00:06:45.900> which

lot of folk coming off the top which

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.379
