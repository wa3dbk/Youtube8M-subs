00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
this is interesting and then the second

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.170 
this is interesting and then the second
thing<00:00:31.289> he<00:00:31.500> said<00:00:31.800> on<00:00:31.949> Twitter<00:00:32.250> about<00:00:32.669> half<00:00:33.000> an

thing he said on Twitter about half an

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.110 
thing he said on Twitter about half an
hour<00:00:33.329> ago<00:00:33.510> before<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:34.140> recorded<00:00:34.680> this<00:00:34.950> is<00:00:35.190> that

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
hour ago before I recorded this is that

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.440 
hour ago before I recorded this is that
the<00:00:36.750> level<00:00:37.559> height<00:00:37.860> um<00:00:39.469> default<00:00:40.469> level<00:00:41.160> height

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
the level height um default level height

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.819 
the level height um default level height
sky<00:00:42.450> limit<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:42.930> everything<00:00:43.350> is<00:00:43.500> going<00:00:43.739> to

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
sky limit and everything is going to

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.490 
sky limit and everything is going to
stay<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.219> same<00:00:44.489> but<00:00:44.850> in<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.649> code<00:00:47.090> it<00:00:48.090> now

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
stay the same but in the code it now

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.290 
stay the same but in the code it now
deliver<00:00:49.500> height<00:00:49.890> now<00:00:50.129> apparently<00:00:50.700> depends<00:00:51.210> on

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
deliver height now apparently depends on

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.170 
deliver height now apparently depends on
just<00:00:51.510> one<00:00:51.809> variable<00:00:52.440> which<00:00:53.430> can<00:00:53.820> be<00:00:53.969> easily

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
just one variable which can be easily

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.790 
just one variable which can be easily
altered<00:00:54.840> by<00:00:55.110> modest<00:00:55.680> so<00:00:56.989> anyone<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.649> know

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
altered by modest so anyone you know

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.920 
altered by modest so anyone you know
wanting<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.340> make<00:00:59.489> mods<00:00:59.760> with<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.300> higher<00:01:00.539> sky

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
wanting to make mods with a higher sky

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.080 
wanting to make mods with a higher sky
limit<00:01:01.350> that's<00:01:02.070> now<00:01:02.370> going<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.730> be<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.879> lot

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
limit that's now going to be a lot

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.939 
limit that's now going to be a lot
easier<00:01:03.149> for<00:01:03.690> them<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.049> do<00:01:04.379> because<00:01:04.619> they'll

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
easier for them to do because they'll

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.820 
easier for them to do because they'll
just<00:01:05.189> have<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.430> change<00:01:05.820> one<00:01:06.090> number<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.830> then

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
just have to change one number and then

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.750 
just have to change one number and then
there's<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.900> email<00:01:09.900> he's<00:01:10.260> put<00:01:10.619> on<00:01:10.830> his<00:01:11.340> blog

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
there's a email he's put on his blog

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.100 
there's a email he's put on his blog
which<00:01:12.450> shall<00:01:12.689> also<00:01:12.869> link<00:01:13.290> up<00:01:13.530> from<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.310> modder

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
which shall also link up from a modder

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.600 
which shall also link up from a modder
whether<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.259> is<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.409> pros<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:16.799> cons<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.369> doing

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
whether it is the pros and cons of doing

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.570 
whether it is the pros and cons of doing
that<00:01:17.909> from<00:01:18.540> their<00:01:18.720> own<00:01:18.869> experience<00:01:19.680> most<00:01:20.340> of

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
that from their own experience most of

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.359 
that from their own experience most of
which<00:01:20.700> seems<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.150> be<00:01:21.409> if<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.860> increase<00:01:23.220> the

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
which seems to be if you increase the

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.340 
which seems to be if you increase the
sky<00:01:23.640> limit<00:01:24.030> then<00:01:24.299> obviously<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:25.320> means

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
sky limit then obviously that means

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.730 
sky limit then obviously that means
there's<00:01:25.920> more<00:01:26.360> blocks<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:28.049> might<00:01:28.290> make<00:01:28.560> the

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
there's more blocks so it might make the

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.920 
there's more blocks so it might make the
game<00:01:28.950> lag<00:01:29.369> more<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.970> sector<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.509> so<00:01:30.659> forth

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
game lag more that sector and so forth

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.770 
game lag more that sector and so forth
but<00:01:31.110> if<00:01:31.380> you're<00:01:31.590> interested<00:01:31.650> in<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.280> details

but if you're interested in the details

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.319
