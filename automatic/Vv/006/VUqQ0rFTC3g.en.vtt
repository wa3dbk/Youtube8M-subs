hello<00:00:00.840> everyone<00:00:01.290> so<00:00:01.979> last<00:00:02.460> time<00:00:02.730> I<00:00:03.000> asked<00:00:03.810> for

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
hello everyone so last time I asked for

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.849 
hello everyone so last time I asked for
some<00:00:04.140> help<00:00:04.170> from<00:00:04.620> you<00:00:04.710> guys<00:00:05.060> looking<00:00:06.060> for<00:00:06.359> some

00:00:06.849 --> 00:00:06.859 
some help from you guys looking for some

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:09.230 
some help from you guys looking for some
looking<00:00:07.859> for<00:00:08.010> a<00:00:08.040> way<00:00:08.160> to<00:00:08.189> compact<00:00:08.880> this

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
looking for a way to compact this

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.490 
looking for a way to compact this
circuit<00:00:09.840> here<00:00:09.870> and<00:00:10.610> all<00:00:11.610> this<00:00:11.940> does<00:00:12.179> is<00:00:12.389> it

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:12.500 
circuit here and all this does is it

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.560 
circuit here and all this does is it
outputs<00:00:13.500> whether<00:00:14.309> there's<00:00:14.610> three<00:00:15.299> or<00:00:15.420> less

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
outputs whether there's three or less

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.950 
outputs whether there's three or less
players<00:00:15.960> in<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.289> world<00:00:16.529> or<00:00:17.250> four<00:00:18.119> or<00:00:18.330> more<00:00:18.539> it

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
players in the world or four or more it

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.890 
players in the world or four or more it
does<00:00:19.140> an<00:00:19.260> output<00:00:19.619> for<00:00:19.859> four<00:00:20.070> or<00:00:20.100> more<00:00:20.490> if<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:20.939> can

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
does an output for four or more if I can

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.240 
does an output for four or more if I can
simulate<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.560> by<00:00:22.769> doing<00:00:23.130> that<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:25.250> little

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
simulate it by doing that a little

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.160 
simulate it by doing that a little
output<00:00:26.760> thriller<00:00:27.330> sore<00:00:27.570> for<00:00:27.750> more<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.109> it

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
output thriller sore for more and it

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.870 
output thriller sore for more and it
just<00:00:28.380> it's<00:00:28.859> just<00:00:28.949> testing<00:00:29.519> for<00:00:29.699> how<00:00:29.820> many

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
just it's just testing for how many

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.840 
just it's just testing for how many
people<00:00:30.090> are<00:00:30.510> in<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.689> world<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.140> so<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.460> got<00:00:32.820> a

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
people are in the world and so I got a

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.630 
people are in the world and so I got a
few<00:00:33.360> responses<00:00:34.110> um<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:35.750> few<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.399> these<00:00:38.399> are<00:00:38.579> the

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
few responses um a few and these are the

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.290 
few responses um a few and these are the
two<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:39.239> kind<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:39.780> stuck<00:00:40.170> out<00:00:40.410> for<00:00:40.710> this<00:00:41.300> this

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
two that kind of stuck out for this this

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.010 
two that kind of stuck out for this this
first<00:00:42.600> one<00:00:42.899> here<00:00:43.460> for<00:00:44.460> people<00:00:44.820> sent<00:00:45.239> me<00:00:45.360> pretty

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
first one here for people sent me pretty

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.500 
first one here for people sent me pretty
much<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.739> same<00:00:46.950> thing<00:00:47.360> slightly<00:00:48.360> at

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
much the same thing slightly at

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.180 
much the same thing slightly at
variations<00:00:49.260> on<00:00:49.410> everything<00:00:49.739> but<00:00:49.920> they<00:00:50.070> all

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
variations on everything but they all

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.380 
variations on everything but they all
kind<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.460> got<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.940> same<00:00:51.210> pretty<00:00:51.960> much<00:00:52.140> idea

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
kind of got the same pretty much idea

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.880 
kind of got the same pretty much idea
they<00:00:54.390> might<00:00:54.629> not<00:00:54.750> have<00:00:54.930> all<00:00:55.050> used<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.440> hopper

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
they might not have all used a hopper

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.279 
they might not have all used a hopper
but<00:00:56.219> what<00:00:57.000> it's<00:00:57.120> doing<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.629> it's<00:00:57.840> using<00:00:58.199> a

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
but what it's doing is it's using a

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.819 
but what it's doing is it's using a
hopper<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:59.579> you<00:01:00.510> put<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.840> amount<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.170> stuff<00:01:01.649> in

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
hopper to you put the amount of stuff in

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.690 
hopper to you put the amount of stuff in
here<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.190> instead<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:03.000> this<00:01:03.239> one's<00:01:03.510> comparing

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:04.700 
here and instead of this one's comparing

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:10.190 
here and instead of this one's comparing
a<00:01:05.700> four<00:01:06.630> lengths<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:07.080> wire<00:01:07.970> so<00:01:08.970> this<00:01:09.930> one's

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
a four lengths of wire so this one's

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.899 
a four lengths of wire so this one's
only<00:01:10.770> getting<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.189> ear<00:01:11.460> because<00:01:11.670> there's

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
only getting the ear because there's

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.429 
only getting the ear because there's
only<00:01:11.970> one<00:01:12.360> player<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.900> world<00:01:13.670> but<00:01:15.439> instead

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
only one player in the world but instead

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.100 
only one player in the world but instead
of<00:01:16.619> doing<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.009> instead<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:18.150> testing<00:01:18.840> if<00:01:18.960> the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
of doing that instead of testing if the

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.999 
of doing that instead of testing if the
length<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.619> wire<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:20.100> for<00:01:20.520> its<00:01:21.830> testing<00:01:22.830> a

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
length of the wire is for its testing a

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.090 
length of the wire is for its testing a
hopper<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.820> comparing<00:01:24.659> whatever<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.710> put<00:01:25.950> in

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
hopper and comparing whatever you put in

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.359 
hopper and comparing whatever you put in
the<00:01:26.220> hopper<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:27.030> whatever<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.890> this<00:01:29.340> is

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
the hopper to whatever it is so this is

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.730 
the hopper to whatever it is so this is
length<00:01:29.880> 4<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.570> it's<00:01:30.720> comparing<00:01:31.140> this<00:01:31.290> number

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
length 4 and it's comparing this number

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.690 
length 4 and it's comparing this number
two<00:01:32.960> what<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.079> tests<00:01:34.560> for<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.130> then<00:01:35.579> it

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
two what it tests for and then it

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.840 
two what it tests for and then it
outputs<00:01:36.650> and<00:01:37.650> outputs<00:01:38.040> here<00:01:38.130> three<00:01:38.579> or<00:01:38.700> less

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
outputs and outputs here three or less

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.310 
outputs and outputs here three or less
or<00:01:39.390> down<00:01:39.869> here<00:01:39.900> for<00:01:40.470> four<00:01:40.710> or<00:01:40.740> more<00:01:41.750> so<00:01:42.750> you're

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
or down here for four or more so you're

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.600 
or down here for four or more so you're
less<00:01:43.439> in<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.649> world<00:01:45.229> that's<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.610> this

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
less in the world that's it this

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.539 
less in the world that's it this
comparator<00:01:48.180> goes<00:01:48.420> into<00:01:48.720> this<00:01:48.899> which<00:01:49.770> outputs

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
comparator goes into this which outputs

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.999 
comparator goes into this which outputs
down<00:01:50.729> here<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.210> then<00:01:52.079> this<00:01:52.110> way<00:01:52.439> i'll<00:01:52.590> put<00:01:52.799> sup

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
down here and then this way i'll put sup

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.520 
down here and then this way i'll put sup
here<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:56.030> for<00:01:57.030> three<00:01:57.329> or<00:01:57.479> less<00:01:57.719> for<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.200> three

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
here and for three or less for the three

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.969 
here and for three or less for the three
or<00:01:58.649> less<00:01:58.860> output<00:01:59.159> up<00:01:59.579> here<00:01:59.990> that's<00:02:00.990> going<00:02:01.590> to

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
or less output up here that's going to

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.260 
or less output up here that's going to
be<00:02:02.009> three<00:02:02.969> ticks

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
be three ticks

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.240 
be three ticks
so<00:02:05.270> it's<00:02:05.870> also<00:02:05.990> looking<00:02:06.470> for<00:02:06.740> a<00:02:06.770> faster

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
so it's also looking for a faster

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.240 
so it's also looking for a faster
pattern<00:02:07.520> like<00:02:07.910> this<00:02:07.940> one's<00:02:08.360> Pistons<00:02:09.229> based<00:02:09.890> in

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
pattern like this one's Pistons based in

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.390 
pattern like this one's Pistons based in
it<00:02:10.450> has<00:02:11.450> a<00:02:11.480> good<00:02:11.720> for<00:02:12.470> tix<00:02:12.770> for<00:02:13.070> most<00:02:13.220> of<00:02:13.310> the

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
it has a good for tix for most of the

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.630 
it has a good for tix for most of the
things<00:02:13.580> on<00:02:13.850> there<00:02:14.030> or<00:02:14.060> five<00:02:14.510> tix<00:02:15.370> but<00:02:16.370> to<00:02:16.520> get

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
things on there or five tix but to get

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.580 
things on there or five tix but to get
down<00:02:16.850> here<00:02:17.330> it's<00:02:17.540> only<00:02:18.050> two<00:02:18.800> tix<00:02:20.050> and<00:02:21.050> up<00:02:21.380> there

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
down here it's only two tix and up there

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.760 
down here it's only two tix and up there
it's<00:02:21.830> three<00:02:22.070> tix<00:02:22.310> so<00:02:22.850> it's<00:02:23.770> generally

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
it's three tix so it's generally

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.080 
it's three tix so it's generally
superior<00:02:25.160> and<00:02:25.520> it's<00:02:25.640> compact<00:02:27.370> to<00:02:28.370> expand<00:02:28.940> that

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
superior and it's compact to expand that

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.250 
superior and it's compact to expand that
one<00:02:29.240> over<00:02:29.360> there<00:02:29.540> I<00:02:29.630> would<00:02:29.900> have<00:02:29.990> had<00:02:30.140> to

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
one over there I would have had to

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.199 
one over there I would have had to
extend<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.890> wire<00:02:31.100> out<00:02:31.130> longer<00:02:31.670> but<00:02:31.970> for<00:02:32.120> this

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
extend the wire out longer but for this

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.510 
extend the wire out longer but for this
one<00:02:32.480> all<00:02:32.660> I<00:02:32.690> have<00:02:32.930> to<00:02:32.990> do<00:02:33.200> is<00:02:33.440> play<00:02:34.130> stuff<00:02:34.370> in

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
one all I have to do is play stuff in

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.790 
one all I have to do is play stuff in
this<00:02:34.640> hopper<00:02:35.530> and<00:02:36.530> this<00:02:37.430> is<00:02:37.610> another<00:02:38.180> design

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
this hopper and this is another design

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.870 
this hopper and this is another design
it<00:02:40.570> also<00:02:41.570> is<00:02:41.720> two<00:02:41.900> tix<00:02:42.200> for<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:42.830> four<00:02:43.250> one<00:02:43.640> and

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
it also is two tix for the four one and

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.610 
it also is two tix for the four one and
three<00:02:44.180> tix<00:02:44.420> for<00:02:44.690> the<00:02:44.810> three<00:02:45.680> or<00:02:45.800> less<00:02:46.570> but<00:02:47.620> it's

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
three tix for the three or less but it's

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.580 
three tix for the three or less but it's
I<00:02:49.100> know<00:02:49.580> it's<00:02:49.730> just<00:02:49.790> different<00:02:50.590> basically

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
I know it's just different basically

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.010 
I know it's just different basically
it's<00:02:51.830> too<00:02:52.010> wide<00:02:52.250> this<00:02:52.790> one's<00:02:53.030> three<00:02:53.300> wide<00:02:53.510> um

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
it's too wide this one's three wide um

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.810 
it's too wide this one's three wide um
and<00:02:54.770> it's<00:02:54.980> just<00:02:55.160> kind<00:02:55.250> of<00:02:55.340> a<00:02:55.430> different<00:02:55.670> take

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
and it's just kind of a different take

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.280 
and it's just kind of a different take
on<00:02:56.000> things<00:02:56.709> there's<00:02:57.709> it<00:02:58.610> uses<00:02:58.910> two<00:02:59.090> furnaces<00:02:59.570> I

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
on things there's it uses two furnaces I

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.870 
on things there's it uses two furnaces I
mean<00:03:00.530> these<00:03:00.620> could<00:03:00.830> be<00:03:00.920> hoppers<00:03:01.280> too<00:03:01.550> i<00:03:01.580> could

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
mean these could be hoppers too i could

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.090 
mean these could be hoppers too i could
do<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:02.090> same<00:03:02.239> thing<00:03:02.480> over<00:03:02.570> here<00:03:02.860> hopper<00:03:03.860> based

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
do the same thing over here hopper based

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.210 
do the same thing over here hopper based
or<00:03:04.489> this<00:03:05.120> one<00:03:05.410> on<00:03:06.410> the<00:03:06.800> left<00:03:07.160> one<00:03:07.580> up<00:03:07.880> here<00:03:08.180> has

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
or this one on the left one up here has

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.979 
or this one on the left one up here has
42<00:03:10.220> redstone<00:03:10.730> dust<00:03:10.910> in<00:03:11.120> it<00:03:11.209> the<00:03:11.390> right<00:03:11.570> one<00:03:11.720> has

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
42 redstone dust in it the right one has

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.520 
42 redstone dust in it the right one has
32<00:03:12.830> and<00:03:13.239> that<00:03:14.239> gives<00:03:14.450> an<00:03:14.600> output<00:03:14.660> of<00:03:14.930> either<00:03:15.170> 4

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
32 and that gives an output of either 4

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.130 
32 and that gives an output of either 4
or<00:03:15.560> 3<00:03:16.000> and<00:03:18.190> this<00:03:19.190> is<00:03:19.400> basically<00:03:19.820> comparing<00:03:20.600> the

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
or 3 and this is basically comparing the

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.470 
or 3 and this is basically comparing the
higher<00:03:21.530> number<00:03:21.890> and<00:03:22.160> the<00:03:23.030> lower<00:03:23.360> number<00:03:23.959> and<00:03:24.340> i

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
higher number and the lower number and i

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.759 
higher number and the lower number and i
still<00:03:26.480> haven't<00:03:26.750> totally<00:03:26.930> figured<00:03:27.140> out<00:03:27.590> of

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
still haven't totally figured out of

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:29.580 
still haven't totally figured out of
this<00:03:27.890> one<00:03:28.130> work<00:03:28.340> so<00:03:28.580> there's<00:03:28.820> four

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
this one work so there's four

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.660 
this one work so there's four
comparators<00:03:30.590> I'm<00:03:30.830> still<00:03:31.070> wrapping<00:03:31.519> my<00:03:31.640> head

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
comparators I'm still wrapping my head

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.380 
comparators I'm still wrapping my head
around<00:03:31.850> comparators<00:03:32.720> so<00:03:33.470> really<00:03:33.769> I<00:03:34.390> don't

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
around comparators so really I don't

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.360 
around comparators so really I don't
it's<00:03:35.840> a<00:03:36.290> really<00:03:36.709> cool<00:03:36.950> device<00:03:37.280> and<00:03:39.130> yeah<00:03:40.130> so

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
it's a really cool device and yeah so

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.009 
it's a really cool device and yeah so
it's<00:03:40.459> basically<00:03:40.610> they're<00:03:41.090> the<00:03:41.239> caring<00:03:41.720> for

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
it's basically they're the caring for

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:43.479 
it's basically they're the caring for
and<00:03:42.350> the<00:03:42.410> three<00:03:42.680> and<00:03:42.950> I<00:03:43.010> can't<00:03:43.250> really<00:03:43.370> explain

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
and the three and I can't really explain

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.530 
and the three and I can't really explain
much<00:03:44.000> beyond<00:03:44.269> that<00:03:44.299> but<00:03:44.600> it's<00:03:44.750> it's<00:03:45.049> awesome

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
much beyond that but it's it's awesome

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.640 
much beyond that but it's it's awesome
yep<00:03:47.540> and<00:03:48.140> that's<00:03:48.680> it<00:03:49.870> this<00:03:50.870> could<00:03:51.079> be<00:03:51.110> adjusted

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
yep and that's it this could be adjusted

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.410 
yep and that's it this could be adjusted
just<00:03:51.769> throw<00:03:52.190> more<00:03:52.370> redstone<00:03:52.579> in<00:03:52.910> here<00:03:53.180> um

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
just throw more redstone in here um

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.449 
just throw more redstone in here um
can't<00:03:54.019> put<00:03:54.170> it<00:03:54.230> over<00:03:54.350> here<00:03:54.560> if<00:03:54.709> it's<00:03:54.829> a<00:03:54.890> furnace

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
can't put it over here if it's a furnace

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.100 
can't put it over here if it's a furnace
so<00:03:56.150> you<00:03:56.239> could<00:03:56.420> you<00:03:56.630> could<00:03:56.720> always<00:03:56.870> change

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
so you could you could always change

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.520 
so you could you could always change
these<00:03:57.380> to<00:03:57.530> hoppers<00:03:57.920> to<00:03:58.190> an<00:03:58.400> hourly<00:03:59.530> father

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
these to hoppers to an hourly father

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.370 
these to hoppers to an hourly father
anything<00:04:00.980> but<00:04:01.519> it<00:04:01.760> still<00:04:02.060> shows<00:04:02.299> three<00:04:02.720> LS<00:04:02.989> and

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
anything but it still shows three LS and

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.650 
anything but it still shows three LS and
then<00:04:04.220> if<00:04:04.310> there<00:04:04.519> was<00:04:04.670> four<00:04:05.060> people<00:04:05.360> in<00:04:05.450> here

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
then if there was four people in here

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.400 
then if there was four people in here
which<00:04:05.959> I<00:04:05.989> can't<00:04:06.530> really<00:04:06.620> simulate<00:04:07.660> it<00:04:08.660> will<00:04:08.989> do

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
which I can't really simulate it will do

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.309 
which I can't really simulate it will do
that<00:04:09.590> Kiku<00:04:10.310> the<00:04:10.459> red<00:04:10.610> stoner<00:04:10.910> has<00:04:11.810> two<00:04:11.959> juki

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
that Kiku the red stoner has two juki

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:16.240 
that Kiku the red stoner has two juki
warned<00:04:12.709> me<00:04:12.860> about<00:04:12.950> you<00:04:13.099> um<00:04:13.730> and<00:04:15.010> these<00:04:16.010> are<00:04:16.070> the

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
warned me about you um and these are the

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.259 
warned me about you um and these are the
four<00:04:16.459> further<00:04:16.669> that<00:04:17.030> made

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
four further that made

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.680 
four further that made
this<00:04:17.389> one<00:04:17.979> slight<00:04:18.979> variations<00:04:19.639> of<00:04:19.789> it<00:04:19.940> just

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
this one slight variations of it just

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.089 
this one slight variations of it just
kind<00:04:20.900> of<00:04:20.959> grouped<00:04:21.169> it<00:04:21.319> together<00:04:21.560> on<00:04:21.709> this<00:04:21.859> one

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:22.099 
kind of grouped it together on this one

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:24.700 
kind of grouped it together on this one
about<00:04:23.030> the<00:04:23.150> same<00:04:23.330> they<00:04:23.599> all<00:04:23.690> did<00:04:23.930> the<00:04:24.080> hopper

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
about the same they all did the hopper

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:30.009 
about the same they all did the hopper
trick<00:04:25.009> and<00:04:25.699> that's<00:04:26.659> about<00:04:26.780> it<00:04:27.009> bat
