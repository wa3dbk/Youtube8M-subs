and you actually can't really tell the
difference<00:05:50.150> between<00:05:53.410> the<00:05:54.410> viewfinder<00:05:54.890> is

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:54.950 
difference between the viewfinder is

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.070 
difference between the viewfinder is
actually<00:05:55.430> amazing<00:05:55.940> it's<00:05:56.450> actually<00:05:56.750> no

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
actually amazing it's actually no

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.280 
actually amazing it's actually no
different<00:05:57.620> than<00:05:57.770> LCD<00:05:58.370> itself<00:05:58.880> I<00:05:59.150> was<00:06:00.080> really

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:00.290 
different than LCD itself I was really

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.260 
different than LCD itself I was really
scared<00:06:00.530> I<00:06:00.710> would<00:06:00.890> have<00:06:01.070> trouble<00:06:01.280> tracking

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270 
scared I would have trouble tracking

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.080 
scared I would have trouble tracking
focus<00:06:02.980> it<00:06:03.980> also<00:06:04.100> has<00:06:04.280> a<00:06:04.310> sensor<00:06:04.730> right<00:06:04.850> here<00:06:04.910> in

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.090 
focus it also has a sensor right here in

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.300
