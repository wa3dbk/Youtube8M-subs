00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
was able to hell it even further and the

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.890 
was able to hell it even further and the
fact<00:00:13.290> that<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.620> sales<00:00:13.889> went<00:00:14.190> up<00:00:14.660> as<00:00:15.660> an

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
fact that the sales went up as an

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.920 
fact that the sales went up as an
indication<00:00:16.379> that<00:00:17.369> it<00:00:17.730> was<00:00:18.150> exactly<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.690> right

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
indication that it was exactly the right

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.410 
indication that it was exactly the right
time<00:00:19.320> but<00:00:19.980> nobody<00:00:20.520> could<00:00:20.699> have<00:00:20.789> conceived<00:00:21.240> the

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
time but nobody could have conceived the

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.870 
time but nobody could have conceived the
spider-man<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:22.710> don't<00:00:22.920> extend<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:23.640> don't

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
spider-man and I don't extend I don't

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.730 
spider-man and I don't extend I don't
think<00:00:23.910> Stan<00:00:24.269> could<00:00:24.600> contrive<00:00:25.199> that<00:00:25.500> and

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
think Stan could contrive that and

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.830 
think Stan could contrive that and
schemed<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.550> be<00:00:26.760> that<00:00:26.939> way<00:00:26.970> I<00:00:27.300> think<00:00:27.750> he

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
schemed it to be that way I think he

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.259 
schemed it to be that way I think he
took<00:00:28.380> me<00:00:28.560> by<00:00:28.769> default<00:00:29.189> because<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.760> was<00:00:29.939> easier

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
took me by default because I was easier

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.990 
took me by default because I was easier
to<00:00:30.300> work<00:00:30.510> with<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.900> dick<00:00:31.520> on<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.669> other<00:00:32.790> hand

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
to work with the dick on the other hand

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.450 
to work with the dick on the other hand
you<00:00:33.180> may<00:00:33.360> have<00:00:33.480> gone<00:00:33.719> if<00:00:33.989> he<00:00:34.500> was<00:00:34.649> possible<00:00:35.280> if

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
you may have gone if he was possible if

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.490 
you may have gone if he was possible if
somebody<00:00:36.059> else<00:00:36.239> was<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.480> portable<00:00:36.930> cartoonist

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
somebody else was a portable cartoonist

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.850 
somebody else was a portable cartoonist
than<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.739> you're<00:00:38.010> an<00:00:38.129> illustrator<00:00:39.860> if

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
than you you're an illustrator if

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.410 
than you you're an illustrator if
somebody<00:00:41.219> was<00:00:41.340> more<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.760> cartooning<00:00:42.300> he

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
somebody was more of the cartooning he

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.729 
somebody was more of the cartooning he
may<00:00:42.570> have<00:00:42.660> gone<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:43.050> but<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.320> think<00:00:43.559> he

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
may have gone that but I think he

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.440 
may have gone that but I think he
recognized<00:00:44.399> at<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.730> point<00:00:45.090> because<00:00:45.239> he

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
recognized at that point because he

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.000 
recognized at that point because he
certainly<00:00:45.719> recognized<00:00:46.170> Jack<00:00:46.469> was<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.770> wrong

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
certainly recognized Jack was the wrong

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.950

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:22.829 
if you only have one choice until you

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:25.460 
if you only have one choice until you
actually<00:02:23.010> have<00:02:23.340> that<00:02:23.489> one<00:02:23.670> choice<00:02:23.910> yeah<00:02:24.480> when

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
actually have that one choice yeah when

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.770 
actually have that one choice yeah when
when<00:02:25.920> I<00:02:25.950> sit<00:02:26.340> down<00:02:26.370> to<00:02:26.549> write<00:02:27.329> something<00:02:27.629> I

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
when I sit down to write something I

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.539 
when I sit down to write something I
hopefully<00:02:28.230> know<00:02:28.379> who's<00:02:28.620> going<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:29.160> draw<00:02:29.370> it

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
hopefully know who's going to draw it

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.089 
hopefully know who's going to draw it
and<00:02:29.780> it<00:02:30.780> it<00:02:31.470> would<00:02:31.590> be<00:02:31.709> a<00:02:31.739> different<00:02:31.950> story

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
with each of these guys it would be a

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.630 
with each of these guys it would be a
totally<00:02:34.230> different<00:02:34.620> view<00:02:34.829> not<00:02:35.280> only<00:02:35.459> because

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640
