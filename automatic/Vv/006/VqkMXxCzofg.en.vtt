 they last bÃ²lit erario it was twilight 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.570
 stephenie meyer when I read this book 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.000
 for the first time does I think four 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.559
 years I loved it and this was free that I 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.289
 He opened the doors to reading 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.910
 young adults so I thank you very much 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.699
 this book in question all love to 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.350
 first view a million songs for babies 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.870
 is the second book in the series of 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.969
 wake up I loved both the cover of 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.649
 this one that I bought it with the plan 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.090
 buy me after the first book of 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.159
 third book but they took the cover of the 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.640
 third book and the ten so I do not 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.260
 stay with 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.909
 the book but if on the cover of this 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.100
 it was love at first sight question 3 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.470
 It started as friends' love and you finish 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.790
 taking it the guest by stephenie meyer 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.380
 I read this at the time I was 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.240
 losing stephenie meyer so 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.130
 entering this book I was already sure 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.990
 I 'm going to like it but I ended up loving it 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.910
 I loved this book the first 200 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.160
 pages is a bit difficult to get into 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.509
 to the story but the rest was super 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.610
 fast I think he did it like a few 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.950
 four times fourth question do you feel 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.380
 passion for not love 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.240
 recently audition by veronica road 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.460
 this anticipation by the end I cried 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.619
 very much then we clarify with the evidence 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.720
 my passion but I did not feel love for that 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.310
 book for nothing an exception 5 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.110
 feelings of deceit and I did not feel 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.690
 deceived by a single book but rather 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.789
 a series and that seal was the series of 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.320
 edomex put it on and the first book and not 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:53.640
 I really liked the plot felt 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.020
 quite intriguing what was going to happen in 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.130
 the following books read the second 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.350
 book and 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.880
 I did not like at all what was 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.460
 happening I felt that things are 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.750
 happening because if they were right 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.750
 a friend read the third book and 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.149
 he did not like it either, so never 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.830
 first series question 6 breaking 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.970
 definitely definitive game of 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.690
 thrones I do not know if you have noticed 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.670
 but I sold my box set ' left of thrones 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.980
 I had here so they have no idea 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.599
 that this book could be horrible to deal with 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.459
 of finishing them a torture I'm sorry 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:26.620
 a lot for the fans of that series but not 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.180
 I liked question 7 you started hating it 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.069
 and you ended up loving him on behalf of 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.930
 wind by patrick groups as I said in 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.549
 my previous life the first 15% was 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.900
 quite difficult to put a story 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.670
 I honestly thought that what will happen to me 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.830
 same as with game of thrones so 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.660
 I was about to leave but 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.840
 finishing that book I really liked it 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.819
 question 8 the love of your life none is 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.560
 because no book has been my favorite 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:51.010
 or any of that but because the gone so many 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.140
 books that using do not brag about anything 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.810
 that but I've read so many books that 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.160
 you can not catch only one, that is if 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.960
 tell me about each gender 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.910
 January photos I can tell you which ones 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.110
 they are my favorites of the paranormal genre 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.730
 I can tell you which are favorites by 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.220
 choose one of all the books that I have 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.840
 read is impossible question 9 you had 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.330
 children with him I definitely had children 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.920
 with a bread to give me version and give me 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.630
 reading this book from this series I read 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.000
 the six books of the Georgian series 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.460
 qin kai I read the first two books 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.070
 from the series the boat lines and I read the 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.860
 graphic novel of love so in 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.900
 total of my two mir read me 14 books 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.700
 and a graphic novel and the latest 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.410
 Question is a book that sees you 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.450
 aging with this mobile question by 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.160
 the popular route and I will say that harry 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.540
 potter is a book that I really think 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.490
 that is going to become a classic of 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.100
 children and adults and of all ages 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.230
 because it really is totally epic 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.090
 and a book that I see in the future of 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.010
 reading it my children and all that there 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.780
 a very distant future and already with that 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.880
