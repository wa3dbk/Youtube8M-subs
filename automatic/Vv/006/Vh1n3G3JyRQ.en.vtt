00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.470 
guess what the nuclear power plant can
really<00:04:03.250> give<00:04:03.400> you<00:04:03.490> a<00:04:03.520> lot<00:04:03.700> of<00:04:03.730> information<00:04:04.030> in

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
really give you a lot of information in

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.480 
really give you a lot of information in
this<00:04:04.600> data<00:04:04.840> layer<00:04:05.080> if<00:04:05.290> you<00:04:05.320> do<00:04:05.680> not<00:04:05.860> manage<00:04:06.280> it

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:06.490 
this data layer if you do not manage it

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:07.800 
this data layer if you do not manage it
properly<00:04:06.910> but<00:04:07.060> don't<00:04:07.240> worry<00:04:07.330> we'll<00:04:07.540> go<00:04:07.660> over

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
properly but don't worry we'll go over

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.870 
properly but don't worry we'll go over
that<00:04:07.930> in<00:04:07.990> the<00:04:08.440> nuclear<00:04:08.800> power<00:04:09.040> plant<00:04:09.370> tutorial

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
that in the nuclear power plant tutorial

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.840 
that in the nuclear power plant tutorial
so<00:04:10.840> guys<00:04:11.110> please<00:04:11.380> take<00:04:12.340> a<00:04:12.370> look<00:04:12.520> at<00:04:12.610> all<00:04:12.760> the

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
so guys please take a look at all the

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.460 
so guys please take a look at all the
tutorials<00:04:13.150> and<00:04:13.600> get<00:04:13.840> very<00:04:14.080> familiar<00:04:14.440> with

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
tutorials and get very familiar with

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.010 
tutorials and get very familiar with
them<00:04:15.180> before<00:04:16.180> you<00:04:16.210> start<00:04:16.270> your<00:04:16.600> city<00:04:16.780> so<00:04:16.960> you

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:17.020 
them before you start your city so you

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:19.890 
them before you start your city so you
can<00:04:17.230> you<00:04:17.920> know<00:04:18.040> avoid<00:04:18.400> the<00:04:19.150> down<00:04:19.600> to<00:04:19.810> the

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
can you know avoid the down to the

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.500 
can you know avoid the down to the
pitfalls<00:04:20.290> and<00:04:20.650> the

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
pitfalls and the

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.430 
pitfalls and the
negativities<00:04:22.510> of<00:04:22.690> some<00:04:22.900> of<00:04:22.990> these<00:04:23.110> power

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
negativities of some of these power

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.290 
negativities of some of these power
choices<00:04:24.190> and<00:04:24.370> make<00:04:24.760> sure<00:04:24.880> that<00:04:24.970> you<00:04:25.090> choose

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
choices and make sure that you choose

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.150 
choices and make sure that you choose
the<00:04:25.450> one<00:04:25.630> that<00:04:25.660> best<00:04:26.110> fits<00:04:26.590> what<00:04:27.040> you're

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
the one that best fits what you're

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.460 
the one that best fits what you're
trying<00:04:27.430> to<00:04:27.490> do<00:04:27.610> in<00:04:27.730> your<00:04:27.880> city<00:04:28.060> okay<00:04:28.900> some

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
trying to do in your city okay some

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.670 
trying to do in your city okay some
other<00:04:29.590> key<00:04:29.860> information<00:04:30.010> to<00:04:30.400> know<00:04:30.700> just<00:04:31.330> some

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
other key information to know just some

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.640 
other key information to know just some
nuggets<00:04:32.680> of<00:04:32.740> information<00:04:34.110> with<00:04:35.110> this<00:04:35.350> gauge

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
nuggets of information with this gauge

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.340 
nuggets of information with this gauge
here<00:04:36.100> if<00:04:36.310> it's<00:04:37.030> in<00:04:37.150> a<00:04:37.240> negative<00:04:37.660> obviously

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
here if it's in a negative obviously

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.680 
here if it's in a negative obviously
that<00:04:39.100> means<00:04:39.340> you<00:04:39.550> are<00:04:39.580> not<00:04:39.940> producing<00:04:40.420> enough

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
that means you are not producing enough

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.170 
that means you are not producing enough
power<00:04:40.930> for<00:04:41.200> your<00:04:41.320> city<00:04:41.560> keep<00:04:42.340> in<00:04:42.490> mind<00:04:42.730> that

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
power for your city keep in mind that

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.880 
power for your city keep in mind that
very<00:04:43.240> create<00:04:43.840> all<00:04:43.960> the<00:04:44.140> critical<00:04:44.530> buildings

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
very create all the critical buildings

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.670 
very create all the critical buildings
in<00:04:45.070> this<00:04:45.340> game<00:04:45.610> will<00:04:46.450> not<00:04:46.720> run<00:04:47.050> without<00:04:47.410> power

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
in this game will not run without power

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.310 
in this game will not run without power
think<00:04:48.520> of<00:04:48.640> it<00:04:48.730> as<00:04:48.850> you<00:04:49.270> and<00:04:49.420> I<00:04:49.510> if<00:04:49.780> we're<00:04:50.020> going

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
think of it as you and I if we're going

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.930 
think of it as you and I if we're going
to<00:04:50.440> work<00:04:50.710> and<00:04:50.920> there's<00:04:51.040> no<00:04:51.160> power<00:04:51.400> we<00:04:51.640> really

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
to work and there's no power we really

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.409 
to work and there's no power we really
cannot<00:04:52.390> work<00:04:52.630> so<00:04:53.380> in<00:04:53.800> this<00:04:54.730> game<00:04:54.940> it<00:04:55.180> works

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
cannot work so in this game it works

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:57.510 
cannot work so in this game it works
just<00:04:55.840> the<00:04:55.900> same<00:04:55.990> so<00:04:56.620> make<00:04:56.890> sure<00:04:56.919> that<00:04:57.130> you<00:04:57.400> guys

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
just the same so make sure that you guys

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.930 
just the same so make sure that you guys
do<00:04:57.820> not<00:04:58.320> or<00:04:59.320> make<00:04:59.860> sure<00:04:59.890> that<00:05:00.070> you<00:05:00.220> do<00:05:00.460> keep<00:05:00.760> an

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
do not or make sure that you do keep an

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.490 
do not or make sure that you do keep an
eye<00:05:01.060> on<00:05:01.180> this<00:05:01.300> gauge<00:05:01.570> here<00:05:01.840> so<00:05:02.050> that<00:05:02.230> you<00:05:02.350> can

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
eye on this gauge here so that you can

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.640 
eye on this gauge here so that you can
know<00:05:03.250> when<00:05:03.700> there's<00:05:04.390> a<00:05:04.480> crisis<00:05:04.870> because<00:05:05.530> I

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
know when there's a crisis because I

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.170 
know when there's a crisis because I
will<00:05:05.830> let<00:05:05.950> you<00:05:06.040> know<00:05:06.070> with<00:05:06.370> utilities<00:05:06.940> if

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
will let you know with utilities if

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.690 
will let you know with utilities if
anything<00:05:08.080> goes<00:05:08.290> wrong<00:05:08.470> with<00:05:08.710> these<00:05:08.860> guys<00:05:09.160> the
