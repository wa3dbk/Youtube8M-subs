00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.740
 Hey folks 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.020
 A new machine with you today. 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.360
 continuing another video about that 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.190
 series about the beginning guitarist 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.020
 how to create a solo 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.270
 We then came the last video 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.610
 I showed some ideas to start with. 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.460
 nor those entrance of the soil 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.140
 but how it is to compose a sleep really is 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.280
 I like to write an essay 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:37.160
 vettel the beginning the middle and the end then 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.840
 that it would be in a essay you have a theme 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.700
 to develop 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.650
 you'll get a start of an entry 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.239
 you have a way that you will 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.590
 develop and you will have a 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.989
 finalization 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.790
 we will continue with this analogy for the 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.020
 people see how it would be there for us 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.130
 create a solo 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:57.559
 Let's get a certain type of theme. 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:00.500
 so we can develop it 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:04.189
 What happens is I really like using 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.680
 as an example for my students 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:09.110
 the Acreans the year he has 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.520
 compositions with themes and incredibly 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.799
 simple but that are completely 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.920
 sticky they stay in the head reminds 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:21.079
 of that summer song song that was very 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.939
 often theme and sport 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:24.139
 spectacular something like that always 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:26.389
 it appeared right 

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:33.560
 if you go to see it's a theme completely 

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:35.119
 simple so much antana this does not have 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.520
 no difficulty 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:41.359
 but what happens is the way he 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.450
 touches the end he puts there and he goes 

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:46.429
 taking that thing there and changing it 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.249
 certain notes each time he or she 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:52.429
 Just call to say that changed but he 

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:54.919
 continues to have that idea in the 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:57.649
 he continued to make changes around 

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:59.359
 but the idea is always the same then it is 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.479
 More or less, what do you have to do? 

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:05.329
 do on the ground when you start you 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.069
 develop a theme is you get the 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:09.920
 develop there or a song 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:12.290
 instrument that is no longer from the 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.480
 moment that you are summing in. 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.680
 of some melody you will develop 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.439
 a theme you will do 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.480
 the variations after you started and 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:24.569
 Then you have to give a break to 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.430
 You close, okay? Let's see more or less. 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.530
 how is that there is theme for the 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.540
 several classes is but how am I doing? 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.290
 always on top of that base I 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.109
 I passed 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.409
 Let's do this, I'll get you. 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:41.900
 I'll give you some idea of ​​a theme 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:44.780
 very simple and I'll make some 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.129
 I will not even make any difference. 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.620
 continue the theme 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:52.470
 some bloomed around the theme to 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.250
 people see what will happen is the result 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.209
 Last 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.209
 let's take a look then
