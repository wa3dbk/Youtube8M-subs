00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
that we want to speak about is the

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.480 
that we want to speak about is the
differences<00:00:09.719> in<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.200> grip<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:10.980> naked<00:00:11.190> eye

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
differences in the grip to the naked eye

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.850 
differences in the grip to the naked eye
if<00:00:11.639> you're<00:00:11.790> just<00:00:11.969> looking<00:00:12.300> at<00:00:12.420> where<00:00:13.320> the

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
if you're just looking at where the

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.310 
if you're just looking at where the
index<00:00:14.219> knuckle<00:00:14.610> is<00:00:14.730> on<00:00:14.969> both<00:00:15.420> grips<00:00:15.780> it<00:00:16.020> looks

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
index knuckle is on both grips it looks

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.890 
index knuckle is on both grips it looks
almost<00:00:16.560> identical<00:00:17.240> however<00:00:18.240> there<00:00:18.750> is<00:00:18.869> a

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
almost identical however there is a

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.660 
almost identical however there is a
slight<00:00:19.199> difference<00:00:19.410> on<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.830> grip<00:00:20.039> in<00:00:20.220> the

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
slight difference on the grip in the

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.000 
slight difference on the grip in the
heel<00:00:20.880> pad<00:00:21.119> feather<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:22.170> slightly<00:00:22.500> more<00:00:22.740> round

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
heel pad feather is slightly more round

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.609 
heel pad feather is slightly more round
to<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.250> continental<00:00:23.939> grip<00:00:24.119> so<00:00:25.080> is<00:00:25.170> his

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
to the continental grip so is his

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.920 
to the continental grip so is his
knuckle<00:00:26.070> is<00:00:26.250> on<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:27.090> eastern<00:00:27.449> back<00:00:27.660> hand<00:00:27.869> grip

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
knuckle is on the eastern back hand grip

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.019 
knuckle is on the eastern back hand grip
but<00:00:28.560> its<00:00:28.740> heel<00:00:28.920> pad<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.310> leaning<00:00:29.640> towards<00:00:29.970> a

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
but its heel pad is leaning towards a

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.550 
but its heel pad is leaning towards a
continental<00:00:30.689> it's<00:00:30.960> not<00:00:31.140> all<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.380> way<00:00:31.529> but

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
continental it's not all the way but

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.610 
continental it's not all the way but
it's<00:00:31.859> in<00:00:31.980> between<00:00:32.070> both<00:00:32.489> whereas<00:00:33.390> Wawrinka<00:00:33.960> is

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
it's in between both whereas Wawrinka is

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.620 
it's in between both whereas Wawrinka is
much<00:00:34.980> further<00:00:35.280> round<00:00:35.640> with<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.850> heel<00:00:36.059> pad<00:00:36.270> and

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
much further round with a heel pad and

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.299 
much further round with a heel pad and
that<00:00:37.230> makes<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.590> big<00:00:37.620> difference<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:38.250> the

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
that makes a big difference in the

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.000 
that makes a big difference in the
contact<00:00:38.700> point<00:00:38.910> feather<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.390> like<00:00:39.570> this<00:00:39.890> in<00:00:40.890> a

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
contact point feather is like this in a

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.340 
contact point feather is like this in a
kind<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.280> awkward<00:00:41.700> awkward<00:00:42.270> position<00:00:42.719> whereas

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
kind of awkward awkward position whereas

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.290 
kind of awkward awkward position whereas
more<00:00:43.500> ink<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.800> much<00:00:44.280> more<00:00:44.489> solid<00:00:44.940> with<00:00:45.210> the

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
more ink is much more solid with the

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:55.330 
more ink is much more solid with the
heel<00:00:45.539> pad<00:00:45.719> being<00:00:46.110> further<00:00:46.440> round

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.600 

you

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.310 

so<00:00:58.540> as<00:00:58.809> you<00:00:58.930> can<00:00:59.110> see<00:00:59.320> when<00:00:59.710> he's

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
so as you can see when he's

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.900 
so as you can see when he's
when<00:01:00.410> contact<00:01:00.920> is<00:01:01.040> being<00:01:01.190> made<00:01:01.310> if<00:01:01.610> you<00:01:01.640> push

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
when contact is being made if you push

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.810 
when contact is being made if you push
against<00:01:02.210> my<00:01:02.360> hand<00:01:02.560> here<00:01:03.560> very<00:01:04.190> strong<00:01:04.580> very

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
against my hand here very strong very

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.790 
against my hand here very strong very
strong<00:01:05.089> he's<00:01:05.360> got<00:01:05.570> that<00:01:05.780> leverage<00:01:06.530> on<00:01:06.710> the

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
strong he's got that leverage on the

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.270 
strong he's got that leverage on the
wrist

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
wrist

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.540 
wrist
whereas<00:01:07.840> fetters<00:01:08.840> grip<00:01:09.200> is<00:01:09.470> a<00:01:09.950> little<00:01:10.370> bit

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
whereas fetters grip is a little bit

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.750 
whereas fetters grip is a little bit
harder<00:01:11.150> it's<00:01:11.300> not<00:01:11.479> as<00:01:11.600> easy<00:01:11.780> to<00:01:11.900> do<00:01:12.140> that<00:01:12.760> now

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
harder it's not as easy to do that now

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.060 
harder it's not as easy to do that now
this<00:01:13.940> can<00:01:14.150> also<00:01:14.360> cause<00:01:14.630> problems<00:01:15.050> when<00:01:15.890> you're

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
this can also cause problems when you're

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.460 
this can also cause problems when you're
hitting<00:01:16.520> balls<00:01:16.790> a<00:01:16.910> little<00:01:17.150> bit<00:01:17.240> higher<00:01:17.540> I<00:01:17.840> feel

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
hitting balls a little bit higher I feel

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.290 
hitting balls a little bit higher I feel
like<00:01:18.619> this<00:01:18.860> it's<00:01:19.220> a<00:01:19.340> lot<00:01:19.520> tougher<00:01:19.700> to<00:01:19.910> hit<00:01:20.150> that

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
like this it's a lot tougher to hit that

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.150 
like this it's a lot tougher to hit that
higher<00:01:20.570> ball<00:01:20.840> and<00:01:21.259> as<00:01:21.380> perhaps<00:01:21.590> one<00:01:21.950> of<00:01:21.979> the

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160 
higher ball and as perhaps one of the

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.070 
higher ball and as perhaps one of the
reasons<00:01:22.490> that<00:01:22.550> Federer<00:01:23.240> struggles<00:01:23.750> against

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
reasons that Federer struggles against

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.320 
reasons that Federer struggles against
the<00:01:24.200> fireballs<00:01:24.590> of<00:01:24.680> Nadal<00:01:25.040> the<00:01:25.880> next<00:01:26.150> thing

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
the fireballs of Nadal the next thing

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.480 
the fireballs of Nadal the next thing
when<00:01:26.690> fedo<00:01:26.930> starts<00:01:27.320> tape<00:01:27.590> back<00:01:27.860> feathers

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
when fedo starts tape back feathers

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.760 
when fedo starts tape back feathers
racket<00:01:28.880> is<00:01:28.970> facing<00:01:29.180> towards<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:30.170> direction

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
racket is facing towards the direction

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.910 
racket is facing towards the direction
of<00:01:30.920> his<00:01:31.280> opponent<00:01:31.759> so<00:01:31.910> it's<00:01:32.030> like<00:01:32.180> this<00:01:32.420> in

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
of his opponent so it's like this in

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.650 
of his opponent so it's like this in
that<00:01:33.920> position<00:01:34.130> here<00:01:34.729> more<00:01:35.090> ink<00:01:35.240> has<00:01:35.390> already

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
that position here more ink has already

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.410 
that position here more ink has already
turned<00:01:35.869> the<00:01:36.170> racket<00:01:36.470> face<00:01:36.649> sideways<00:01:37.420> towards

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
turned the racket face sideways towards

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.880 
turned the racket face sideways towards
the<00:01:38.479> sides<00:01:38.720> of<00:01:38.869> the<00:01:38.930> court<00:01:39.080> towards<00:01:39.560> the<00:01:39.619> left

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
the sides of the court towards the left

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:48.260 
the sides of the court towards the left
side<00:01:40.100> of<00:01:40.250> the<00:01:40.310> court

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:55.580 

you

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.060 

so<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.520> preparation<00:01:57.149> phase<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.600> Rinka<00:01:58.070> wins

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
so that preparation phase of Rinka wins

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.889 
so that preparation phase of Rinka wins
on<00:01:59.340> by<00:01:59.549> preparing<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.119> little<00:02:00.390> bit<00:02:00.509> earlier<00:02:00.840> so

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
on by preparing a little bit earlier so

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.170 
on by preparing a little bit earlier so
those<00:02:01.229> faster<00:02:01.680> balls<00:02:01.890> are<00:02:02.100> coming<00:02:02.280> -<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:03.000> can

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
those faster balls are coming - you can

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.730 
those faster balls are coming - you can
react<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.689> can<00:02:03.840> hit<00:02:03.960> them<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.229> little<00:02:04.439> quicker

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
react you can hit them a little quicker

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.850 
react you can hit them a little quicker
lean<00:02:04.890> further<00:02:05.070> I<00:02:05.220> could<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:06.420> next<00:02:06.600> thing<00:02:06.930> in

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
lean further I could the next thing in

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.559 
lean further I could the next thing in
the<00:02:07.950> back<00:02:08.220> position<00:02:08.429> more<00:02:08.970> ink<00:02:09.149> is<00:02:09.270> already

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
the back position more ink is already

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.080 
the back position more ink is already
here<00:02:10.200> because<00:02:10.800> of<00:02:10.950> that<00:02:11.039> starting<00:02:11.580> position

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
here because of that starting position

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:19.470 
here because of that starting position
here<00:02:12.360> will<00:02:12.959> rank<00:02:13.110> it<00:02:13.230> gets<00:02:13.410> to<00:02:13.560> here

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.080 

where's<00:02:20.050> Federer<00:02:20.470> a<00:02:20.770> lot<00:02:21.459> of<00:02:21.580> balls<00:02:21.760> his

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
where's Federer a lot of balls his

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:29.160 
where's Federer a lot of balls his
strings<00:02:22.480> open<00:02:22.780> up

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.620 

now<00:02:29.650> this<00:02:29.830> causes<00:02:30.130> a<00:02:30.190> lot<00:02:30.220> of<00:02:30.400> trouble<00:02:30.610> on

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
now this causes a lot of trouble on

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.710 
now this causes a lot of trouble on
like<00:02:31.900> Alex<00:02:32.230> said<00:02:32.790> especially<00:02:33.790> because<00:02:34.450> the

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
like Alex said especially because the

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.360 
like Alex said especially because the
strings<00:02:35.050> open<00:02:35.440> up<00:02:35.560> to<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.740> sky<00:02:35.980> knees<00:02:36.160> trying

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
strings open up to the sky knees trying

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.070 
strings open up to the sky knees trying
to<00:02:36.430> get<00:02:36.520> topspin<00:02:37.060> from<00:02:37.660> that<00:02:37.870> position

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
to get topspin from that position

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.020 
to get topspin from that position
whereas<00:02:39.040> Marinka<00:02:39.520> doesn't<00:02:39.790> have<00:02:39.880> that

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
whereas Marinka doesn't have that

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.370 
whereas Marinka doesn't have that
problem<00:02:40.240> because<00:02:40.420> more<00:02:40.780> ink<00:02:40.930> is<00:02:41.050> in<00:02:41.200> that

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
problem because more ink is in that

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.770 
problem because more ink is in that
position<00:02:41.560> is<00:02:42.460> so<00:02:42.700> much<00:02:42.910> easier<00:02:43.150> to<00:02:43.390> handle<00:02:43.570> the

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
position is so much easier to handle the

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.990 
position is so much easier to handle the
high<00:02:43.930> balls<00:02:44.200> so<00:02:44.860> Federer<00:02:45.190> has<00:02:45.340> to<00:02:45.460> work<00:02:45.610> a<00:02:45.760> lot

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
high balls so Federer has to work a lot

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.060 
high balls so Federer has to work a lot
harder<00:02:46.030> to<00:02:46.510> generate<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:47.110> spin<00:02:47.380> it<00:02:47.860> does<00:02:48.040> a

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
harder to generate the spin it does a

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.650 
harder to generate the spin it does a
great<00:02:48.280> job<00:02:48.370> doing<00:02:48.790> it<00:02:49.030> but<00:02:49.210> I<00:02:49.240> think<00:02:49.510> that

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
great job doing it but I think that

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.330 
great job doing it but I think that
someone<00:02:49.960> like<00:02:49.990> Stan<00:02:50.530> Wawrinka<00:02:50.620> has<00:02:51.040> a<00:02:51.070> more

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
someone like Stan Wawrinka has a more

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.860 
someone like Stan Wawrinka has a more
efficient<00:02:51.730> one<00:02:51.880> at<00:02:52.390> that

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
efficient one at that

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.130 
efficient one at that
now<00:02:53.740> one<00:02:53.980> thing<00:02:54.010> this<00:02:54.400> can<00:02:54.610> do<00:02:54.900> from<00:02:55.900> this

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
now one thing this can do from this

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.900 
now one thing this can do from this
position<00:02:56.380> if<00:02:57.010> you<00:02:57.160> were<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:57.400> opponent<00:02:57.760> down

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
position if you were the opponent down

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.030 
position if you were the opponent down
there<00:02:58.150> you<00:02:58.990> maybe<00:02:59.230> don't<00:02:59.410> know<00:02:59.590> if<00:02:59.710> Federer<00:02:59.950> is

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
there you maybe don't know if Federer is

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.070 
there you maybe don't know if Federer is
going<00:03:00.160> to<00:03:00.220> end<00:03:00.370> up<00:03:00.460> slicing<00:03:00.820> the<00:03:01.060> ball<00:03:01.240> always

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
going to end up slicing the ball always

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.620 
going to end up slicing the ball always
going<00:03:02.470> to<00:03:02.500> hit<00:03:02.680> the<00:03:03.070> topspin<00:03:03.490> so<00:03:04.360> it's<00:03:04.480> got<00:03:04.600> a

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
going to hit the topspin so it's got a

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.810 
going to hit the topspin so it's got a
lot<00:03:04.810> better<00:03:05.020> disguise<00:03:05.530> when<00:03:06.280> playing<00:03:06.580> against

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
lot better disguise when playing against

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.190 
lot better disguise when playing against
an<00:03:06.940> opponent<00:03:07.210> where<00:03:07.480> the<00:03:07.570> opponent<00:03:07.750> doesn't

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
an opponent where the opponent doesn't

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.720 
an opponent where the opponent doesn't
know<00:03:08.290> what<00:03:08.470> he's<00:03:08.560> going<00:03:08.710> to<00:03:08.770> hit<00:03:08.950> and<00:03:09.580> that

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
know what he's going to hit and that

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.430 
know what he's going to hit and that
probably<00:03:10.150> works<00:03:10.360> in<00:03:10.570> his<00:03:10.630> favor<00:03:10.690> as<00:03:11.110> he's<00:03:11.320> able

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
probably works in his favor as he's able

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.320 
probably works in his favor as he's able
to<00:03:11.620> slice<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.160> ball<00:03:12.280> a<00:03:12.340> lot<00:03:12.490> better<00:03:12.700> than<00:03:12.910> Rico

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
to slice the ball a lot better than Rico

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.630 
to slice the ball a lot better than Rico
but<00:03:13.870> it<00:03:13.990> also<00:03:14.110> probably<00:03:14.530> costs<00:03:14.860> him<00:03:15.010> the

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
but it also probably costs him the

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.640 
but it also probably costs him the
ability<00:03:15.820> to<00:03:16.090> generate<00:03:16.450> that<00:03:16.870> heavy<00:03:17.170> topspin

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
ability to generate that heavy topspin

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:26.130 
ability to generate that heavy topspin
like<00:03:17.890> Wawrinka

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:43.059 

you

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:44.830 

so<00:03:43.670> as<00:03:43.760> you<00:03:43.879> can<00:03:44.030> see<00:03:44.239> both<00:03:44.510> of<00:03:44.569> those

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
so as you can see both of those

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.170 
so as you can see both of those
backgrounds<00:03:45.439> are<00:03:45.530> very<00:03:45.769> very<00:03:46.250> effective<00:03:46.760> and

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
backgrounds are very very effective and

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.300 
backgrounds are very very effective and
they're<00:03:47.629> both<00:03:47.810> are<00:03:48.049> very<00:03:48.260> similar<00:03:48.530> those

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
they're both are very similar those

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.630 
they're both are very similar those
little<00:03:49.640> subtle<00:03:49.879> differences<00:03:50.540> make<00:03:51.110> them

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
little subtle differences make them

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.069 
little subtle differences make them
different<00:03:52.640> players<00:03:52.849> and<00:03:52.970> obviously<00:03:53.540> have

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
different players and obviously have

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:55.600 
different players and obviously have
different<00:03:54.110> results<00:03:54.560> on<00:03:54.890> different<00:03:55.220> surfaces

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
different results on different surfaces

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.699 
different results on different surfaces
so<00:03:56.569> thank<00:03:57.049> you<00:03:57.140> for<00:03:57.290> watching<00:03:57.530> the<00:03:57.620> video
