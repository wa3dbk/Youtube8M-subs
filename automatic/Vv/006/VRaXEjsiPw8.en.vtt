movement of people who want to make

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.679 
movement of people who want to make
physical<00:02:52.620> products<00:02:53.430> together<00:02:53.609> books<00:02:54.480> are<00:02:54.659> a

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:54.689 
physical products together books are a

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:56.119 
physical products together books are a
great<00:02:54.870> example<00:02:54.989> of<00:02:55.349> that<00:02:55.439> what<00:02:55.799> we're<00:02:55.950> seeing

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
great example of that what we're seeing

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:58.520 
great example of that what we're seeing
is<00:02:56.430> online<00:02:56.870> communities<00:02:57.870> of<00:02:58.049> people<00:02:58.169> hooking

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
is online communities of people hooking

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.319 
is online communities of people hooking
up<00:02:58.769> together<00:02:58.919> using<00:02:59.310> blurb<00:02:59.609> technology<00:03:00.180> by

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
up together using blurb technology by

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.420 
up together using blurb technology by
the<00:03:00.419> way<00:03:00.569> to<00:03:00.959> do<00:03:01.109> that<00:03:01.349> to<00:03:01.829> make<00:03:01.980> a<00:03:02.010> book<00:03:02.280> and

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
the way to do that to make a book and

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.449 
the way to do that to make a book and
then<00:03:02.939> that<00:03:03.150> prompts<00:03:03.540> an<00:03:03.659> offline<00:03:04.139> meetup<00:03:04.919> all

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
then that prompts an offline meetup all

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:06.110 
then that prompts an offline meetup all
right<00:03:05.549> it<00:03:05.669> sounds<00:03:05.790> like<00:03:05.939> you're<00:03:06.090> really

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
right it sounds like you're really

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.580 
right it sounds like you're really
building<00:03:06.450> a<00:03:06.629> tremendous<00:03:07.169> community<00:03:07.319> I<00:03:07.560> think

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
building a tremendous community I think

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.709 
building a tremendous community I think
you<00:03:07.769> said<00:03:07.919> quarter<00:03:08.280> million<00:03:08.609> yeah<00:03:09.120> members<00:03:09.599> in

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:09.719 
you said quarter million yeah members in

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:11.990 
you said quarter million yeah members in
commune<00:03:09.959> I<00:03:10.739> mean<00:03:11.010> it's<00:03:11.159> huge<00:03:11.400> and<00:03:11.639> it<00:03:11.879> is

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
commune I mean it's huge and it is

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.520 
commune I mean it's huge and it is
global<00:03:12.359> it's<00:03:12.510> increasingly<00:03:12.989> global<00:03:13.379> right

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
global it's increasingly global right

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.409 
global it's increasingly global right
you<00:03:13.650> have<00:03:13.769> a<00:03:13.829> global<00:03:14.010> presence<00:03:14.340> also<00:03:14.700> now<00:03:15.239> in

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:15.419 
you have a global presence also now in

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:17.599

terms<00:03:15.629> of<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:16.019> the<00:03:16.650> average<00:03:16.950> print<00:03:17.250> run<00:03:17.430> is

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
terms of the the average print run is

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:19.159 
terms of the the average print run is
not<00:03:17.849> that<00:03:18.000> much<00:03:18.180> so<00:03:18.299> it's<00:03:18.419> really<00:03:18.659> an<00:03:18.720> example

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:19.169 
not that much so it's really an example

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:20.719 
not that much so it's really an example
of<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.379> long<00:03:19.530> tail<00:03:19.799> now<00:03:20.310> you've<00:03:20.430> got<00:03:20.609> I<00:03:20.639> think

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:20.729 
of the long tail now you've got I think

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:22.219

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.080 
I think they ordered 3,000 copies so we
can<00:04:57.720> be<00:04:57.840> economic<00:04:58.500> into<00:04:59.220> the<00:04:59.310> many<00:04:59.490> thousands

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
can be economic into the many thousands

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.390 
can be economic into the many thousands
of<00:05:00.240> units<00:05:00.510> as<00:05:00.720> well<00:05:00.900> I<00:05:01.200> think<00:05:01.710> one<00:05:02.160> of<00:05:02.190> the

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
of units as well I think one of the

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.860 
of units as well I think one of the
things<00:05:02.430> that's<00:05:02.790> radically<00:05:03.360> different<00:05:03.750> though

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
things that's radically different though

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.750 
things that's radically different though
now<00:05:04.050> from<00:05:04.650> the<00:05:04.770> way<00:05:04.890> it<00:05:05.010> used<00:05:05.190> to<00:05:05.310> be<00:05:05.430> with<00:05:05.580> book

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
now from the way it used to be with book

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.800 
now from the way it used to be with book
publishing<00:05:06.300> is<00:05:06.570> it<00:05:07.200> used<00:05:07.470> to<00:05:07.620> be<00:05:07.770> I<00:05:07.800> think<00:05:08.160> of

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
publishing is it used to be I think of

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.980 
publishing is it used to be I think of
traditional<00:05:09.810> publishing<00:05:10.170> as<00:05:10.380> VC<00:05:10.830> for<00:05:11.100> authors

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
traditional publishing as VC for authors

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.270 
traditional publishing as VC for authors
these<00:05:12.990> guys<00:05:13.200> had<00:05:13.380> to<00:05:13.410> take<00:05:13.650> all<00:05:13.920> the<00:05:14.070> risk

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
these guys had to take all the risk

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.030 
these guys had to take all the risk
right<00:05:14.850> they<00:05:15.810> have<00:05:15.990> to<00:05:16.200> figure<00:05:16.440> you<00:05:16.650> have<00:05:16.680> a<00:05:16.800> big

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 
right they have to figure you have a big

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.470 
right they have to figure you have a big
enough<00:05:17.250> market<00:05:17.490> that<00:05:17.820> you<00:05:17.850> can<00:05:18.090> efficiently

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480 
enough market that you can efficiently

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.650 
enough market that you can efficiently
reach<00:05:18.840> and<00:05:19.430> they<00:05:20.430> have<00:05:20.880> to<00:05:21.060> believe<00:05:21.270> that<00:05:21.450> they

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
reach and they have to believe that they

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.780 
reach and they have to believe that they
can<00:05:21.690> the<00:05:22.080> economics<00:05:22.590> are<00:05:22.740> there<00:05:22.980> right<00:05:23.550> where

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
can the economics are there right where

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.700 
can the economics are there right where
they<00:05:23.940> can<00:05:24.120> make<00:05:24.240> money<00:05:24.420> on<00:05:24.570> that<00:05:24.810> title<00:05:25.080> you

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
they can make money on that title you

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:26.840 
they can make money on that title you
guys<00:05:25.830> are<00:05:25.980> short<00:05:26.130> of<00:05:26.160> turning<00:05:26.310> it<00:05:26.550> on<00:05:26.610> yeah

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850
