00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.170 
far as the pickup roller goes again
very<00:01:58.320> similar<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.159> how<00:01:59.250> HP<00:01:59.640> has<00:01:59.729> done<00:01:59.939> things

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
very similar to how HP has done things

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.160 
very similar to how HP has done things
I'm<00:02:00.299> going<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.479> try<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.659> close<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.049> in<00:02:01.079> a

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
I'm going to try to close you in a

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.039 
I'm going to try to close you in a
little<00:02:01.380> bit<00:02:01.469> so<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.649> can<00:02:01.710> see<00:02:01.799> this

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
little bit so you can see this

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.209 
little bit so you can see this
there's<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.290> pickup<00:02:04.590> roller<00:02:04.799> right<00:02:04.979> there

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
there's the pickup roller right there

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.399 
there's the pickup roller right there
and<00:02:05.430> now<00:02:06.149> I'm<00:02:06.479> going<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.750> have<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.899> hard<00:02:07.079> time<00:02:07.259> to

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
and now I'm going to have a hard time to

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.169 
and now I'm going to have a hard time to
show<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.649> this<00:02:07.829> but<00:02:08.039> on<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.340> left<00:02:08.610> side<00:02:08.910> and

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
show you this but on the left side and

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.059 
show you this but on the left side and
on<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.170> right<00:02:10.349> side<00:02:10.379> there's<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:10.890> couple

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
on the right side there's a couple

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.119 
on the right side there's a couple
little<00:02:11.220> tabs

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:12.129 
little tabs

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:14.670 
little tabs
and<00:02:12.249> you<00:02:12.459> will<00:02:12.609> push<00:02:12.849> them<00:02:13.030> back<00:02:13.269> to<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.260> to

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
and you will push them back to the to

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.720 
and you will push them back to the to
the<00:02:14.769> left<00:02:14.980> and<00:02:15.129> to<00:02:15.249> the<00:02:15.280> right

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
the left and to the right

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.699 
the left and to the right
by<00:02:16.030> doing<00:02:16.389> so<00:02:16.629> the<00:02:17.049> feed<00:02:17.290> roller<00:02:17.499> will

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
by doing so the feed roller will

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.670 
by doing so the feed roller will
actually<00:02:18.069> snap<00:02:18.400> up<00:02:18.609> its<00:02:18.849> socket<00:02:19.299> and<00:02:19.719> I'll<00:02:20.499> get

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
actually snap up its socket and I'll get

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
actually snap up its socket and I'll get
my<00:02:20.799> note<00:02:21.010> and<00:02:21.159> I'm<00:02:21.310> going<00:02:21.459> to<00:02:21.489> show<00:02:21.639> you

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.440 
there's the pickup roller you can see
not<00:02:36.969> much<00:02:37.209> going<00:02:37.599> on<00:02:37.689> with<00:02:37.930> it<00:02:38.079> real<00:02:38.260> small<00:02:38.590> and

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
not much going on with it real small and

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.989 
not much going on with it real small and
what<00:02:40.450> you<00:02:40.569> can<00:02:40.719> do<00:02:40.900> is<00:02:41.159> actually<00:02:42.159> move<00:02:42.760> the

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:42.999 
what you can do is actually move the

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:45.780 
what you can do is actually move the
grommet<00:02:43.739> where<00:02:44.739> it<00:02:44.829> has<00:02:44.980> more<00:02:45.219> feet<00:02:45.519> tread

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
grommet where it has more feet tread

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.399 
grommet where it has more feet tread
left<00:02:46.000> on<00:02:46.180> it<00:02:46.329> to<00:02:46.480> a<00:02:46.510> new<00:02:46.719> position<00:02:46.930> you<00:02:47.290> can

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:47.409 
left on it to a new position you can

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:49.050 
left on it to a new position you can
actually<00:02:47.560> turn<00:02:48.010> this<00:02:48.219> grommet<00:02:48.639> you'd<00:02:48.760> have<00:02:48.879> to

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
actually turn this grommet you'd have to

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.189 
actually turn this grommet you'd have to
spend<00:02:49.269> some<00:02:49.480> time<00:02:49.659> but<00:02:49.810> you<00:02:49.930> can<00:02:50.049> actually

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:50.199 
spend some time but you can actually

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:52.679 
spend some time but you can actually
turn<00:02:51.010> it<00:02:51.189> to<00:02:51.340> a<00:02:51.370> better<00:02:51.579> area<00:02:51.909> where<00:02:52.510> there's

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:52.689 
turn it to a better area where there's

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:55.199 
turn it to a better area where there's
more<00:02:52.900> rubber<00:02:53.500> tread<00:02:54.010> left<00:02:54.280> and<00:02:54.609> that<00:02:55.000> will<00:02:55.090> get

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
more rubber tread left and that will get

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:56.670 
more rubber tread left and that will get
you<00:02:55.329> through<00:02:55.540> a<00:02:55.569> pinch<00:02:55.870> now<00:02:55.930> you<00:02:56.169> start<00:02:56.500> it<00:02:56.560> off
