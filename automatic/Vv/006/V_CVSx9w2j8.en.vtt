overpowered<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.649> kind<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:43.920> have<00:00:44.070> a

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
overpowered and I kind of have a

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.590 
overpowered and I kind of have a
different<00:00:44.489> opinion<00:00:44.670> from<00:00:44.969> what<00:00:45.390> I've

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
different opinion from what I've

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.779 
different opinion from what I've
experienced<00:00:46.320> with<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.770> map<00:00:46.980> so<00:00:47.219> far<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:47.489> played

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.910 
experienced with the map so far I played
about<00:00:47.910> maybe<00:00:48.690> five<00:00:48.960> hours<00:00:49.350> worth<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.649> armored

about maybe five hours worth of armored
kill<00:00:50.690> the<00:00:51.690> ac-130<00:00:52.289> isn't<00:00:52.770> really<00:00:53.219> what<00:00:53.550> makes

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
kill the ac-130 isn't really what makes

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.360 
kill the ac-130 isn't really what makes
rush<00:00:54.469> difficult<00:00:55.469> really<00:00:55.770> what<00:00:55.980> makes<00:00:56.190> it

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
rush difficult really what makes it

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.340

had<00:01:35.880> some<00:01:36.090> good<00:01:36.299> runs<00:01:36.600> in<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.960> I'm<00:01:37.560> not<00:01:37.770> gonna

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
had some good runs in it I'm not gonna

had some good runs in it I'm not gonna
lie<00:01:38.009> but<00:01:38.490> for<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.939> most<00:01:39.150> part<00:01:39.299> that's<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:39.930> just

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
lie but for the most part that's it just

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.840 
lie but for the most part that's it just
like<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:40.619> said<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.829> shooting<00:01:41.310> target<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:41.700> mean

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
like I said a shooting target I mean

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.030 
like I said a shooting target I mean
it's<00:01:41.970> just<00:01:42.030> their<00:01:42.360> most<00:01:43.140> good<00:01:43.350> jet<00:01:43.590> pilots<00:01:43.950> are

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
it's just their most good jet pilots are

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.350 
it's just their most good jet pilots are
going<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.250> knock<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.579> thing<00:01:44.640> out<00:01:44.939> of<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.119> sky

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
going to knock that thing out of the sky

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.929 
going to knock that thing out of the sky
and<00:01:45.630> 20<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.110> 30<00:01:46.350> seconds<00:01:46.829> upon<00:01:47.250> spawning<00:01:47.670> if

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
and 20 to 30 seconds upon spawning if

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.240 
and 20 to 30 seconds upon spawning if
you<00:01:48.659> know<00:01:48.780> if<00:01:48.930> even<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.500> long<00:01:49.740> because<00:01:50.009> if

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
you know if even that long because if

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.679 
you know if even that long because if
there's<00:01:50.430> one<00:01:50.490> thing<00:01:50.610> else<00:01:50.970> I've<00:01:51.149> learned<00:01:51.450> it's

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
there's one thing else I've learned it's

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.080 
there's one thing else I've learned it's
that<00:01:52.049> everyone<00:01:52.530> on<00:01:52.649> pc<00:01:52.979> now<00:01:53.220> runs<00:01:53.549> stingers

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
that everyone on pc now runs stingers

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.330 
that everyone on pc now runs stingers
and<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.509> was<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:54.960> if<00:01:55.380> you<00:01:55.500> watch<00:01:55.710> in<00:01:55.950> this<00:01:56.100> kit

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
and it was and if you watch in this kit

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.920 
and it was and if you watch in this kit
in<00:01:56.460> particular<00:01:56.969> I<00:01:57.000> will<00:01:57.240> run<00:01:57.390> out<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:57.600> ammo

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
in particular I will run out of ammo

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.749 
in particular I will run out of ammo
here<00:01:58.140> in<00:01:58.380> about<00:01:58.590> two<00:01:58.860> magazines<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.579> pick

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
here in about two magazines and I pick

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.639 
here in about two magazines and I pick
up<00:01:59.909> another<00:02:00.149> engineer<00:02:00.630> kit<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.049> what<00:02:01.530> do<00:02:01.619> you

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
up another engineer kit and what do you

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.469 
up another engineer kit and what do you
know<00:02:01.740> it's<00:02:02.189> got<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.490> Stinger<00:02:02.880> on<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.180> so<00:02:03.329> I<00:02:03.360> think

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
know it's got a Stinger on it so I think

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.819 
know it's got a Stinger on it so I think
that<00:02:03.689> just<00:02:03.719> kind<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.049> proves<00:02:04.409> there's<00:02:04.680> how

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
that just kind of proves there's how

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.270 
that just kind of proves there's how
fearful<00:02:05.790> people<00:02:05.939> are<00:02:06.329> of<00:02:06.600> some<00:02:07.350> of<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.619> of<00:02:08.069> the

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
fearful people are of some of the of the

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.430 
fearful people are of some of the of the
ac-130<00:02:08.849> they<00:02:09.090> have<00:02:09.300> literally<00:02:09.780> no<00:02:10.050> tolerance

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
ac-130 they have literally no tolerance

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.610 
ac-130 they have literally no tolerance
for<00:02:10.670> and<00:02:11.670> I<00:02:11.760> think<00:02:12.030> what<00:02:12.300> that<00:02:12.480> causes

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
for and I think what that causes

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.289 
for and I think what that causes
Lisa<00:02:13.739> in<00:02:13.890> my<00:02:14.010> opinion<00:02:14.280> is<00:02:14.549> it<00:02:14.730> causes<00:02:15.150> this

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
Lisa in my opinion is it causes this

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.089 
Lisa in my opinion is it causes this
vacuum<00:02:15.599> you've<00:02:16.110> got<00:02:16.290> everyone<00:02:16.739> running

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
vacuum you've got everyone running

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.410 
vacuum you've got everyone running
stingers<00:02:17.519> because<00:02:17.819> they're<00:02:17.970> scared<00:02:18.150> of<00:02:18.360> the

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
stingers because they're scared of the

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.020 
stingers because they're scared of the
ac-130<00:02:19.140> but<00:02:19.980> then<00:02:20.129> on<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.280> flip<00:02:20.519> side<00:02:20.640> you've

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
ac-130 but then on the flip side you've

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.880 
ac-130 but then on the flip side you've
got<00:02:21.060> no<00:02:21.480> one<00:02:21.690> who<00:02:21.900> wants<00:02:22.110> to<00:02:22.170> shoot<00:02:22.379> you<00:02:22.769> know

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
got no one who wants to shoot you know

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.699 
got no one who wants to shoot you know
shoot<00:02:23.159> RPGs<00:02:23.760> at<00:02:23.909> the<00:02:24.030> main<00:02:24.209> vehicle<00:02:24.659> so<00:02:25.110> that's

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
shoot RPGs at the main vehicle so that's

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.289 
shoot RPGs at the main vehicle so that's
kind<00:02:25.950> of<00:02:26.010> what<00:02:26.159> we<00:02:26.250> get<00:02:26.400> into<00:02:26.640> you<00:02:26.940> get<00:02:27.090> all

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
kind of what we get into you get all

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:28.789 
kind of what we get into you get all
these<00:02:27.450> engineers<00:02:28.140> on<00:02:28.260> your<00:02:28.290> team<00:02:28.500> you're<00:02:28.680> like

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
these engineers on your team you're like

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:30.589 
these engineers on your team you're like
why<00:02:29.010> am<00:02:29.159> I<00:02:29.250> getting<00:02:29.310> overwhelmed<00:02:30.030> by<00:02:30.150> vehicles

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
why am I getting overwhelmed by vehicles

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:31.970 
why am I getting overwhelmed by vehicles
and<00:02:30.810> it's<00:02:30.900> because<00:02:31.200> none<00:02:31.379> of<00:02:31.409> the<00:02:31.530> engineers

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
and it's because none of the engineers

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.720 
and it's because none of the engineers
actually<00:02:32.670> have<00:02:33.329> RPGs<00:02:34.140> or<00:02:34.769> javelins<00:02:35.220> they<00:02:35.489> have

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
actually have RPGs or javelins they have

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.910 
actually have RPGs or javelins they have
stingers<00:02:36.150> so<00:02:36.450> it's<00:02:37.319> kind<00:02:37.500> of<00:02:37.530> a<00:02:37.620> bummer<00:02:37.799> I

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
stingers so it's kind of a bummer I

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.699 
stingers so it's kind of a bummer I
think<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.750> don't<00:02:39.750> really<00:02:39.959> know<00:02:40.079> if<00:02:40.110> dice<00:02:40.440> could

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
think I don't really know if dice could

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:41.960 
think I don't really know if dice could
balance<00:02:40.890> something<00:02:41.430> like<00:02:41.579> that<00:02:41.760> I<00:02:41.790> mean

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
balance something like that I mean

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.699 
balance something like that I mean
that's<00:02:42.120> just<00:02:42.360> more<00:02:42.510> of<00:02:42.569> a<00:02:42.750> player<00:02:43.079> preference

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
that's just more of a player preference

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.020 
that's just more of a player preference
you<00:02:43.860> know<00:02:43.980> they're<00:02:44.159> going<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:44.519> run<00:02:44.670> what<00:02:44.909> they

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
you know they're going to run what they

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.699 
you know they're going to run what they
think<00:02:45.269> is<00:02:45.390> going<00:02:45.599> to<00:02:45.660> defend<00:02:45.989> them<00:02:46.170> better<00:02:46.379> so

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
think is going to defend them better so

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.839 
think is going to defend them better so
I<00:02:46.920> mean<00:02:47.609> overall<00:02:48.150> though<00:02:48.450> it<00:02:49.549> enjoy<00:02:50.549> this<00:02:50.670> deal

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
I mean overall though it enjoy this deal

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.789 
I mean overall though it enjoy this deal
see<00:02:51.060> I<00:02:51.090> really<00:02:51.569> think<00:02:51.690> it's<00:02:51.870> a<00:02:51.959> solid<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.560> maps

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
see I really think it's a solid the maps

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.099 
see I really think it's a solid the maps
are<00:02:52.980> solid<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:54.060> one<00:02:54.239> other<00:02:54.390> problem<00:02:54.599> I<00:02:54.870> kind

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:55.109 
are solid the one other problem I kind

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:57.050 
are solid the one other problem I kind
of<00:02:55.200> have<00:02:55.410> with<00:02:55.799> rush<00:02:56.129> mode<00:02:56.370> right<00:02:56.549> now<00:02:56.609> is<00:02:56.879> look

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
of have with rush mode right now is look

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.539 
of have with rush mode right now is look
how<00:02:57.209> far<00:02:57.480> back<00:02:57.720> their<00:02:58.049> spawn<00:02:58.409> is<00:02:58.650> from<00:02:59.280> where

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
how far back their spawn is from where

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.280 
how far back their spawn is from where
the<00:02:59.790> incomes<00:03:00.180> are<00:03:00.329> they<00:03:00.450> spawn<00:03:00.720> back<00:03:00.930> there<00:03:01.140> by

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
the incomes are they spawn back there by

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.289 
the incomes are they spawn back there by
the<00:03:01.349> crane<00:03:01.680> that's<00:03:01.890> a<00:03:02.010> long<00:03:02.280> way<00:03:02.489> to<00:03:02.549> run<00:03:02.879> and

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
the crane that's a long way to run and

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.990 
the crane that's a long way to run and
it's<00:03:03.540> a<00:03:03.629> very<00:03:03.739> isolated<00:03:04.739> area<00:03:05.129> at<00:03:05.670> least<00:03:05.879> on

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
it's a very isolated area at least on

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.460 
it's a very isolated area at least on
this<00:03:06.150> map<00:03:06.390> so<00:03:06.690> that's<00:03:07.109> one<00:03:07.260> of<00:03:07.349> the<00:03:07.440> things

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
this map so that's one of the things

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.319 
this map so that's one of the things
that<00:03:07.769> I<00:03:07.890> think<00:03:08.220> that<00:03:08.340> they<00:03:08.819> might<00:03:09.030> want<00:03:09.239> to

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
that I think that they might want to

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.180 
that I think that they might want to
adjust<00:03:09.480> is<00:03:10.019> where<00:03:10.260> how<00:03:10.470> far<00:03:10.739> back<00:03:10.980> the

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
adjust is where how far back the

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.710 
adjust is where how far back the
defenders<00:03:11.640> spawn<00:03:11.940> because<00:03:12.299> I<00:03:12.390> think<00:03:12.540> it<00:03:12.629> would

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
defenders spawn because I think it would

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.509 
defenders spawn because I think it would
make<00:03:12.870> it<00:03:12.900> a<00:03:13.049> little<00:03:13.140> bit<00:03:13.319> more<00:03:13.440> balance<00:03:13.680> if<00:03:14.340> the

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
make it a little bit more balance if the

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.309 
make it a little bit more balance if the
defenders<00:03:14.879> could<00:03:15.060> spawn<00:03:15.329> up<00:03:15.569> close<00:03:15.959> a<00:03:15.989> little

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
defenders could spawn up close a little

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.559 
defenders could spawn up close a little
bit<00:03:16.440> more<00:03:16.620> but<00:03:16.890> you<00:03:17.639> know<00:03:17.760> that<00:03:18.000> I<00:03:18.030> was<00:03:18.299> kind<00:03:18.510> of

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
bit more but you know that I was kind of

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.750 
bit more but you know that I was kind of
sad<00:03:18.750> to<00:03:18.959> see<00:03:18.989> so<00:03:19.260> many<00:03:19.349> people<00:03:19.470> hating<00:03:20.099> on<00:03:20.220> the

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
sad to see so many people hating on the

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.819 
sad to see so many people hating on the
rush<00:03:20.970> game<00:03:21.269> mode<00:03:21.510> for<00:03:22.019> these<00:03:22.200> maps<00:03:22.410> saying<00:03:22.709> it

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
rush game mode for these maps saying it

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:24.860 
rush game mode for these maps saying it
was<00:03:22.950> horrible<00:03:23.280> I<00:03:23.910> definitely<00:03:24.480> see<00:03:24.690> what<00:03:24.810> you

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
was horrible I definitely see what you

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.080 
was horrible I definitely see what you
guys<00:03:24.989> say<00:03:25.230> though<00:03:25.410> I<00:03:25.440> mean<00:03:25.680> I'm<00:03:26.370> not<00:03:26.549> blind<00:03:26.849> I

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
guys say though I mean I'm not blind I

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.250 
guys say though I mean I'm not blind I
can<00:03:27.269> see<00:03:27.480> why<00:03:27.690> people<00:03:27.720> are<00:03:28.139> getting

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
can see why people are getting

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.869 
can see why people are getting
frustrated<00:03:28.889> with<00:03:28.980> it<00:03:29.040> and<00:03:29.370> dice<00:03:29.579> has<00:03:29.760> already

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 
frustrated with it and dice has already

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:31.339 
frustrated with it and dice has already
said<00:03:30.150> that<00:03:30.299> they're<00:03:30.329> gonna<00:03:30.540> they're<00:03:30.870> going<00:03:31.290> to

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
said that they're gonna they're going to

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:33.979 
said that they're gonna they're going to
nerf<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.709> ac-130<00:03:32.340> s<00:03:32.519> respawn<00:03:33.060> timer<00:03:33.359> to<00:03:33.599> 90

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
nerf the ac-130 s respawn timer to 90

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.770 
nerf the ac-130 s respawn timer to 90
seconds<00:03:34.530> so<00:03:34.799> it'll<00:03:35.430> be<00:03:35.549> much<00:03:35.760> harder<00:03:36.000> to<00:03:36.299> to

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
seconds so it'll be much harder to to

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.089 
seconds so it'll be much harder to to
dominate<00:03:37.260> in<00:03:37.379> that<00:03:37.530> if<00:03:37.680> you<00:03:37.769> consider

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
dominate in that if you consider

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:39.500 
dominate in that if you consider
yourself<00:03:38.220> a<00:03:38.459> good<00:03:38.579> pilot<00:03:38.819> but<00:03:39.180> like<00:03:39.329> I<00:03:39.450> said

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
yourself a good pilot but like I said

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.409 
yourself a good pilot but like I said
you<00:03:40.470> get<00:03:40.590> a<00:03:40.620> good<00:03:40.829> mg<00:03:41.190> team<00:03:41.400> of<00:03:41.609> with<00:03:42.000> a<00:03:42.030> couple

on so not having those gunner flares

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.910 
on so not having those gunner flares
have<00:04:26.850> really<00:04:27.540> really<00:04:27.870> made<00:04:28.290> the<00:04:28.470> choppers

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
hard to fly an armored kill now I think

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:32.750 
hard to fly an armored kill now I think
it<00:04:31.680> would<00:04:31.770> have<00:04:31.800> been<00:04:31.950> smart<00:04:32.310> to<00:04:32.460> take<00:04:32.610> the

it would have been smart to take the

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.760 
it would have been smart to take the
chopper<00:04:32.970> floors<00:04:33.330> away<00:04:33.510> on<00:04:33.750> some<00:04:34.020> maps<00:04:34.230> but<00:04:34.560> on

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
chopper floors away on some maps but on

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.950 
chopper floors away on some maps but on
the<00:04:34.980> armored<00:04:35.250> kill<00:04:35.430> maps<00:04:35.700> I'm<00:04:35.970> not<00:04:36.600> a<00:04:36.660> big<00:04:36.930> fan

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
the armored kill maps I'm not a big fan

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.990 
the armored kill maps I'm not a big fan
of<00:04:37.410> not<00:04:37.860> having<00:04:38.190> gunner<00:04:38.370> flares<00:04:38.670> it<00:04:38.880> is

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
of not having gunner flares it is

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.090 
of not having gunner flares it is
extremely<00:04:39.750> difficult<00:04:39.960> to<00:04:40.500> stay<00:04:40.680> up<00:04:40.830> and<00:04:41.010> I

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
extremely difficult to stay up and I

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.510 
extremely difficult to stay up and I
attack<00:04:41.490> helicopter<00:04:42.090> I<00:04:43.020> guess<00:04:43.620> you<00:04:43.980> know<00:04:44.100> maybe

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
attack helicopter I guess you know maybe

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.070 
attack helicopter I guess you know maybe
that's<00:04:44.760> just<00:04:44.940> the<00:04:45.450> way<00:04:45.600> it's<00:04:45.750> going<00:04:45.870> to<00:04:45.960> have

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
that's just the way it's going to have

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.870 
that's just the way it's going to have
to<00:04:46.110> be<00:04:46.350> and<00:04:46.620> you<00:04:46.770> know<00:04:46.890> we<00:04:47.430> have<00:04:47.580> to<00:04:47.610> just

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
to be and you know we have to just

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.480 
to be and you know we have to just
accept<00:04:48.000> that<00:04:48.360> but<00:04:49.070> another<00:04:50.070> thing<00:04:50.250> that<00:04:50.430> I

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
accept that but another thing that I

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:51.980 
accept that but another thing that I
have<00:04:50.670> noticed<00:04:51.030> right<00:04:51.240> off<00:04:51.300> the<00:04:51.540> bat<00:04:51.720> about

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
have noticed right off the bat about

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.410 
have noticed right off the bat about
these<00:04:52.170> maps<00:04:52.470> is<00:04:52.710> it<00:04:53.460> seems<00:04:53.700> like<00:04:53.850> a<00:04:53.880> lot<00:04:53.970> of<00:04:54.240> the

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
these maps is it seems like a lot of the

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.330 
these maps is it seems like a lot of the
elements<00:04:54.540> are<00:04:54.960> borrowed<00:04:55.710> from<00:04:55.740> maps<00:04:56.220> that

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
elements are borrowed from maps that

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.830 
elements are borrowed from maps that
were<00:04:56.490> really<00:04:56.790> familiar<00:04:57.210> with<00:04:57.240> now<00:04:57.510> I<00:04:57.540> knew

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
were really familiar with now I knew

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.210 
were really familiar with now I knew
that<00:04:57.870> was<00:04:58.170> going<00:04:58.350> to<00:04:58.410> be<00:04:58.500> the<00:04:58.620> case<00:04:58.800> on<00:04:58.980> a<00:04:59.010> lot

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
that was going to be the case on a lot

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.710 
that was going to be the case on a lot
of<00:04:59.340> maps<00:04:59.490> just<00:04:59.700> because<00:05:00.000> you<00:05:00.120> know<00:05:00.210> dices<00:05:00.690> I

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
of maps just because you know dices I

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.590 
of maps just because you know dices I
have<00:05:00.930> time<00:05:01.140> to<00:05:01.170> go<00:05:01.380> in<00:05:01.590> a<00:05:01.770> model<00:05:02.100> like<00:05:02.390> 150<00:05:03.390> new

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
have time to go in a model like 150 new

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.900 
have time to go in a model like 150 new
house<00:05:04.200> models<00:05:04.740> for<00:05:05.010> these<00:05:05.160> new<00:05:05.340> maps<00:05:05.520> but

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
house models for these new maps but

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.960 
house models for these new maps but
honestly<00:05:06.750> all<00:05:07.410> the<00:05:07.770> elements<00:05:08.070> for<00:05:08.520> these<00:05:08.730> maps

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
honestly all the elements for these maps

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.750 
honestly all the elements for these maps
could<00:05:09.480> be<00:05:09.720> found<00:05:10.050> in<00:05:10.290> any<00:05:10.440> of<00:05:10.770> the<00:05:10.860> old<00:05:11.010> maps<00:05:11.250> so

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
could be found in any of the old maps so

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.300 
could be found in any of the old maps so
if<00:05:12.120> you<00:05:12.330> took<00:05:12.510> Gulf<00:05:12.810> of<00:05:12.900> Oman<00:05:13.130> reshape<00:05:14.130> the

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
if you took Gulf of Oman reshape the

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.860 
if you took Gulf of Oman reshape the
surface<00:05:14.670> a<00:05:14.760> little<00:05:14.940> bit<00:05:15.060> spread<00:05:15.660> it<00:05:15.750> out<00:05:15.810> a

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
surface a little bit spread it out a

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:16.970 
surface a little bit spread it out a
little<00:05:16.050> bit<00:05:16.170> move<00:05:16.440> some<00:05:16.650> of<00:05:16.680> the<00:05:16.770> houses

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
little bit move some of the houses

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.980 
little bit move some of the houses
around<00:05:17.370> you<00:05:17.580> could<00:05:17.760> get<00:05:17.940> this<00:05:18.150> exact<00:05:18.540> same<00:05:18.720> map

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
around you could get this exact same map

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.690 
around you could get this exact same map
that<00:05:19.260> what<00:05:19.350> I'm<00:05:19.500> playing<00:05:19.770> right<00:05:19.980> now<00:05:20.010> so<00:05:20.460> I

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
that what I'm playing right now so I

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.970 
that what I'm playing right now so I
wish<00:05:21.600> there<00:05:21.960> were<00:05:22.110> some<00:05:22.320> new<00:05:22.410> elements<00:05:22.560> I

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
wish there were some new elements I

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.170 
wish there were some new elements I
think<00:05:23.190> that's<00:05:23.430> one<00:05:23.610> of<00:05:23.640> the<00:05:23.850> biggest

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
think that's one of the biggest

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.760 
think that's one of the biggest
disappointments<00:05:24.900> I<00:05:24.960> have<00:05:25.230> on<00:05:25.440> this<00:05:25.530> backpack

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
disappointments I have on this backpack

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.140 
disappointments I have on this backpack
is<00:05:26.040> it<00:05:26.340> seems<00:05:26.550> like<00:05:26.700> a<00:05:26.730> lot<00:05:26.970> of<00:05:27.000> the

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
is it seems like a lot of the

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.620 
is it seems like a lot of the
environments<00:05:27.780> are<00:05:28.320> just<00:05:28.800> repeats<00:05:29.190> I<00:05:29.430> mean<00:05:29.630> if

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
environments are just repeats I mean if

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.150 
environments are just repeats I mean if
you<00:05:30.840> put<00:05:31.050> me<00:05:31.169> in<00:05:31.200> this<00:05:31.380> building<00:05:31.740> i<00:05:31.830> have<00:05:31.980> right

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
you put me in this building i have right

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.130 
you put me in this building i have right
now<00:05:32.400> and<00:05:32.700> you<00:05:32.970> look<00:05:33.090> across<00:05:33.390> you'd<00:05:33.780> be<00:05:33.930> like<00:05:34.050> oh

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
now and you look across you'd be like oh

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.690 
now and you look across you'd be like oh
you're<00:05:34.320> on<00:05:34.380> sharkey<00:05:34.770> peninsula<00:05:35.310> if<00:05:35.370> I<00:05:35.490> just

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700 
you're on sharkey peninsula if I just

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.520 
you're on sharkey peninsula if I just
showed<00:05:35.880> you<00:05:35.910> like<00:05:36.210> a<00:05:36.240> parallel<00:05:36.690> view<00:05:37.080> of<00:05:37.320> like

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
showed you like a parallel view of like

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.260 
showed you like a parallel view of like
me<00:05:37.800> just<00:05:38.040> looking<00:05:38.250> forward<00:05:38.669> and<00:05:38.730> no<00:05:38.940> you<00:05:39.180> know

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
me just looking forward and no you know

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.270 
me just looking forward and no you know
for<00:05:39.450> no<00:05:39.540> peripheral<00:05:39.990> vision<00:05:40.470> you<00:05:40.620> would<00:05:41.070> never

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
for no peripheral vision you would never

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.820 
for no peripheral vision you would never
know<00:05:41.460> that<00:05:41.940> I'm<00:05:42.360> not<00:05:42.570> on<00:05:42.690> Sharky<00:05:43.080> peninsula<00:05:43.620> on

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
know that I'm not on Sharky peninsula on

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.940 
know that I'm not on Sharky peninsula on
that<00:05:44.100> second<00:05:44.550> set<00:05:44.700> of<00:05:44.730> objectives<00:05:44.970> and<00:05:45.570> I<00:05:46.470> I

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:46.950 
that second set of objectives and I I

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.760 
that second set of objectives and I I
don't<00:05:47.310> know<00:05:47.400> I<00:05:47.640> mean<00:05:48.270> I<00:05:48.360> no<00:05:48.419> dice<00:05:48.780> has<00:05:49.350> limited

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
don't know I mean I no dice has limited

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.380 
don't know I mean I no dice has limited
time<00:05:49.980> to<00:05:50.190> make<00:05:50.340> these<00:05:50.520> map<00:05:50.700> packs<00:05:50.970> but<00:05:51.180> when

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:51.390 
time to make these map packs but when

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.090 
time to make these map packs but when
you<00:05:51.480> hype<00:05:51.630> them<00:05:51.780> up<00:05:51.930> this<00:05:52.110> much<00:05:52.380> I<00:05:52.650> was

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.100 
you hype them up this much I was

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.590 
you hype them up this much I was
expected<00:05:53.610> a<00:05:53.669> little<00:05:53.880> bit<00:05:54.000> more<00:05:54.210> on<00:05:54.450> the

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 
expected a little bit more on the

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.260 
expected a little bit more on the
modeling<00:05:55.110> side<00:05:55.350> of<00:05:55.500> things<00:05:55.650> so<00:05:56.180> you<00:05:57.180> know

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
modeling side of things so you know

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.640 
modeling side of things so you know
maybe<00:05:57.480> that<00:05:57.690> Mabel<00:05:58.020> to<00:05:58.140> do<00:05:58.230> better<00:05:58.440> in<00:05:58.620> the

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
maybe that Mabel to do better in the

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.060 
maybe that Mabel to do better in the
other<00:05:58.860> map<00:05:59.070> packs<00:05:59.340> i<00:05:59.610> am<00:05:59.730> not<00:05:59.910> so<00:06:00.120> sure<00:06:00.150> but

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.070 
other map packs i am not so sure but

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:02.990 
other map packs i am not so sure but
anyways<00:06:02.070> hopefully<00:06:02.460> you<00:06:02.520> guys<00:06:02.580> enjoyed<00:06:02.850> this

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.130 
are some balancing issues with the

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.040 
are some balancing issues with the
actual<00:06:14.400> vehicles<00:06:15.030> but<00:06:15.600> that's<00:06:15.780> going<00:06:15.900> to<00:06:15.990> be

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050 
actual vehicles but that's going to be

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:17.630 
actual vehicles but that's going to be
much<00:06:16.230> easier<00:06:16.260> to<00:06:16.650> fix<00:06:16.860> in<00:06:17.040> the<00:06:17.070> maps<00:06:17.340> i<00:06:17.520> mean

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:17.640 
much easier to fix in the maps i mean

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.790

the<00:06:17.730> maps<00:06:17.940> are<00:06:18.090> fine<00:06:18.360> i<00:06:18.390> love<00:06:19.169> the<00:06:19.320> maps<00:06:19.530> I

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:22.200 
think it's a very solid expansion but I

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.070
