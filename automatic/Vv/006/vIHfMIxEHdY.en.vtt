00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.279
 things 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.779
 and then another ingredient that varies by region in the Caribbean 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.070
 it's an original concept it's easy to do 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.830
 and yet 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.099
 these japanese 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:31.220
 so to start we cut the pale gold sheath 38 eur pregnant the 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:32.450
 party after 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.360
 here we can cost more to pull the quercy and find what you 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.899
 cut it in more titillated to pay what is said 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.400
 it was then another little piece of three centimeter loop 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.290
 it's just so that's pretty bitter I have in the head then be a 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.070
 dilemma 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.300
 that's a fact of arms not what changes every 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.570
 then it's already seen soybean seen well in hand 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.260
 MP listened as loud as it is easier to carry to mix 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.550
 citing 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.300
 I'm talking about three weeks 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.500
 once in power bangkok on the length and then a little 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.890
 rock piece kind of 3000 meters 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.350
 do not want it to be too big so it's easier see what it gives 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.260
 I am 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.440
 the two guards were quite strange to 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.590
 portrait 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.160
 great movie directed by jay carney I like it is essential especially not 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.870
 rely on poor countries since the day before 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.770
 I will present his website if the years pass by aof 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.730
 the day is therefore legitimate but I had a big piece I 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.500
 just use the parties involved were more expensive party that is 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.830
 used because that of the treatment see as if burning 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.010
 they also keep the promise is accurate and after why 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.990
 manipulate and therefore do everything in e 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.080
 thanks to these works 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.080
 gold larger structures and see as its customers m 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.250
 the ftse save time but it's superb 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.320
 and that will help me to determine 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.070
 one side m 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.659
 he postulates to the dough see what the fight is 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.200
 no I do not know but not to use them however the specialist 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.980
 italian massimo at the expense 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.689
 so I wanted to present from there 

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:12.489
 it replaces the flour element and not at the same time it is very practical and 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.680
 if you do not quite get it right at the end of the exam this 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.349
 case 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.349
 in the baba I used the normal family lvmh 

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:23.689
 it's just to give a little more used shot so we add zones 

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:29.230
 the mess if you signed it you put salt to small 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.629
 the last word 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.389
 if you have some 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:36.329
 and here it is well-known to bring down all this well to remove all 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:39.069
 the likes bravo 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.549
 once towards gaps and angers 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:45.529
 which is good too is a beautiful and weight loss 

00:02:45.529 --> 00:02:48.999
 instead of mixing them with you hit it it will bring in scorers 

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:49.689
 of time 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:52.329
 it was enamelled with small bubbles of air 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:54.309
 it'll be lighter 

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:58.099
 there are a few meters left all the ingredients we have prepared the show 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:02.939
 where the bean sprouts the leek life went back to work not much but he 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:05.179
 must now turn more fun 

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:06.469
 like you want 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:08.010
 and that eat well 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.419
 in the beginning these practices and chopsticks do not learn 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:11.780
 the statue this school 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.009
 it's hard 

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:15.979
 but it must be said that she did for all ingredients are who have 

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:17.159
 integrated 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:20.159
 a little bit of oil in the area is she who has surface 

00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:24.299
 for the benefit of his own and then if we wanted to put meat you 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:29.219
 live this is the un-smoked pork belly reading tips 

00:03:29.779 --> 00:03:31.949
 the healthiest activities like that 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:33.229
 a namesake 

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:37.579
 and refute the success failure just half of the dough but not all to 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:40.389
 makes two patties and everything gets complicated 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:43.349
 his ancestors the psn after a quick talk 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:47.279
 so there for went away well and let it cook on medium heat for a 

00:03:47.279 --> 00:03:50.279
 ten minutes 

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:55.119
 we can use a plate that is on it 

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:59.939
 six other people 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:03.029
 in senegal it's good to try but not too bad 

00:04:03.029 --> 00:04:04.599
 the dgsn 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.389
 so we think we hear but in the other direction in fact we accuse the other side 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:09.590
 quite simply 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.499
 and again that's average 

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:13.629
 for ten minutes 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:17.109
 tata steel be careful what it was that bosses but these critics when 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:17.919
 same score 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.139
 it takes time to write 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:21.599
 so after ten minutes 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:23.759
 ap i'm still going back 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:24.909
 Taxquet 

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:27.709
 it's always been a little bit more you can listen to one you can 

00:04:27.709 --> 00:04:31.650
 check inside if vegetables are cooked leached to tikrit but I 

00:04:31.649 --> 00:04:33.639
 tell you right now it takes everything 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.260
 as deadline the older ones take body 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.629
 retourney 

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:42.379
 and if you've ever lived that but not the countries she's trying to closely 

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:43.830
 47% 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.539
 this team 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:49.769
 to go there today lisa those who make noise m it's crazy I want 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:53.639
 and here it is and as it is the last time the low-rhine 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:57.090
 you have to have the show side on the top it's very pretty 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.529
 and there are keys the most important of all that this story 

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:05.629
 if any little arvine we're on the top it's sauce why 

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:08.699
 acquired konami but you can use the resource 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:11.699
 mistake on it's the same thing 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:14.279
 as far as she is 

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:17.279
 what did she want and have cost to hers despite everything pointed out photo m 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:20.370
 chips roudet all these flakes 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.750
 the number of people affected is the dried bonito 5 this smoke I do not 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.420
 not sure if he came back with the waste treatment release 

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:31.069
 BenoÃ®t Genuini paid for himself 

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:33.909
 and when you use big composes his words when as it's 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:34.669
 hot 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:37.669
 and there it moves the courses for anyone that our president of 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.599
