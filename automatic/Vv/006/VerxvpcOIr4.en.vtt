00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 subaru has recognized crossover suv s 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.020
 sell well 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.820
 That's why the Japanese have the xv on 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.130
 the market brought the gap 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.780
 below the forester for him is the 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.790
 Target group does not consist of 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.560
 Rangers and forest workers do that 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.609
 actually in no one in this segment 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.730
 like bmw x1 nissan qashqai and vw tiguan 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.039
 wants subaru hip urban people and 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.240
 So young families appeal to buyers 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.550
 not only worth the 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.470
 functionality of your car but before 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.559
 especially on the design and the lifestyle 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.950
 factor place with the high council houses 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.360
 and a floor clearance of two 120 mm 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.239
 The xv looks like a genuine 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.010
 off-roader the standard 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.809
 permanent four-wheel drive with 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.940
 Central differential also does that 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.039
 drive on more uncomfortable surfaces 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.989
 possible if somebody actually 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.120
 off the piste should be on the way 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.160
 for the others probably count 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.320
 rather the comfortable boarding the high 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.910
 sitting position and the generous space 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.300
 front and back 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.280
 the boot holds from 380 liters 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.290
 space reasons has subaru on one 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.500
 Spare wheel waived and it by a
