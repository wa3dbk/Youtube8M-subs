speaker there is the heat sink which
helps<00:01:17.130> with<00:01:17.700> dissipating<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.750> heat<00:01:18.799> so<00:01:19.799> it

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
helps with dissipating the heat so it

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.289 
helps with dissipating the heat so it
keeps<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.250> cooler<00:01:20.490> performing<00:01:21.150> more

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
keeps it cooler performing more

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.070 
keeps it cooler performing more
efficiently<00:01:21.979> enabling<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.130> get<00:01:23.340> louder

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
efficiently enabling it to get louder

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.060 
efficiently enabling it to get louder
for<00:01:25.080> longer<00:01:25.290> periods<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.680> time<00:01:25.740> obviously

for longer periods of time obviously

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.640 
for longer periods of time obviously
because<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.580> won't<00:01:26.759> be<00:01:26.820> getting<00:01:27.030> as<00:01:27.119> hot<00:01:27.650> as

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
because it won't be getting as hot as
