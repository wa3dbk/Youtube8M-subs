it makes realistic train noises when it

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.749 
it makes realistic train noises when it
goes<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.470> remote<00:00:31.740> control<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:32.369> simple

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
goes and the remote control is simple

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.450 
goes and the remote control is simple
and<00:00:32.910> pretty<00:00:33.120> easy<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.630> understand<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.860> red<00:00:35.309> is

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
and pretty easy to understand the red is

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.459 
and pretty easy to understand the red is
for<00:00:35.700> reverse<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.540> yellow<00:00:36.840> makes<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.320> go

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
for reverse and the yellow makes it go

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.369 
for reverse and the yellow makes it go
forward<00:00:37.850> as<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:39.329> goes<00:00:39.510> forward<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:40.050> actually

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
forward as it goes forward it actually

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.500 
forward as it goes forward it actually
plays<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.649> Thomas<00:00:41.250> theme<00:00:41.579> song<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.270> when<00:00:42.420> it

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
plays the Thomas theme song and when it

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.060 
plays the Thomas theme song and when it
goes<00:00:42.629> in<00:00:42.780> Reverse<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.290> makes<00:00:43.469> these<00:00:43.649> different

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
goes in Reverse it makes these different

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.569 
goes in Reverse it makes these different
train<00:00:44.309> noises<00:00:45.800> you<00:00:46.800> can<00:00:46.950> kind<00:00:47.129> of<00:00:47.190> see<00:00:47.340> for

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
train noises you can kind of see for

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.850 
train noises you can kind of see for
yourself<00:00:48.140> what<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.200> like<00:00:49.350> about<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:49.829> that

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
yourself what I like about it is that

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.619 
yourself what I like about it is that
the<00:00:50.070> remote<00:00:50.340> control<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:50.850> very<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.600> know

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
the remote control is very you know

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.110 
the remote control is very you know
kid-friendly<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:53.070> can<00:00:53.219> drop<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:53.940> it's

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
kid-friendly you can drop it and it's

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.850 
kid-friendly you can drop it and it's
not<00:00:54.239> going<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.510> break<00:00:54.719> it's<00:00:55.440> easy<00:00:55.710> to

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
not going to break it's easy to

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.010 
not going to break it's easy to
understand<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.640> Train<00:00:56.910> actually<00:00:57.149> moves<00:00:57.600> you

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
understand the Train actually moves you

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.130 
understand the Train actually moves you
know<00:00:58.109> fairly<00:00:58.590> well<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.660> it<00:01:00.660> does<00:01:00.840> what<00:01:01.020> it's

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
know fairly well and it does what it's

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.410 
know fairly well and it does what it's
supposed<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.530> do<00:01:01.770> I'm<00:01:02.609> not<00:01:02.760> necessarily<00:01:02.910> like

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
supposed to do I'm not necessarily like

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.750 
supposed to do I'm not necessarily like
about<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:03.870> it's<00:01:04.140> not<00:01:04.320> completely<00:01:05.010> easy<00:01:05.280> for

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
about it it's not completely easy for

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.240 
about it it's not completely easy for
you<00:01:06.119> know<00:01:06.240> toddlers<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.290> be<00:01:07.380> able<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.799> maneuver

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
you know toddlers to be able to maneuver

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.660 
you know toddlers to be able to maneuver
it<00:01:09.030> doesn't<00:01:09.330> always<00:01:09.510> go<00:01:09.900> exactly<00:01:10.549> forward<00:01:11.549> in

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
it doesn't always go exactly forward in

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.330 
it doesn't always go exactly forward in
a<00:01:11.760> straight<00:01:11.820> line<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:13.229> know<00:01:13.799> as<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.070> think

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
a straight line you know as you think

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.649 
a straight line you know as you think
it's<00:01:14.490> going<00:01:14.760> in<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.060> direction<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.479> think

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
it's going in the direction you think

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.320 
it's going in the direction you think
it's<00:01:15.750> going<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:15.930> go<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.670> but<00:01:17.670> once<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.090> get<00:01:18.210> the

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
it's going to go to but once you get the

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.789 
it's going to go to but once you get the
hang<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.900> know<00:01:19.020> it's<00:01:19.229> certainly<00:01:19.409> it

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
hang of it you know it's certainly it

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.520 
hang of it you know it's certainly it
can<00:01:20.130> actually<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:21.720> know<00:01:21.750> maneuver<00:01:22.229> as<00:01:22.350> it's

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
can actually you know maneuver as it's

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.740 
can actually you know maneuver as it's

supposed to I'm an adult i maneuvering
it<00:01:24.900> doesn't<00:01:25.710> necessarily<00:01:26.040> say<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.250> whole<00:01:26.430> lot

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
it doesn't necessarily say a whole lot

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.899

but<00:01:27.140> hey<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.920> know<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.250> certainly<00:01:29.579> can<00:01:29.790> be

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
but hey you know it certainly can be

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.520 
but hey you know it certainly can be
done<00:01:30.090> well<00:01:30.360> my<00:01:30.390> son<00:01:30.509> tends<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.110> play<00:01:31.290> with<00:01:31.439> it

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
done well my son tends to play with it

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.319 
done well my son tends to play with it
he<00:01:31.619> tends<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:31.920> want<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.130> press<00:01:32.310> both<00:01:33.299> buttons

he tends to want to press both buttons
at<00:01:33.900> once<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.860> as<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.070> result<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:35.579> may<00:01:35.670> not

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
at once and as a result it may not

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.580 
at once and as a result it may not
actually<00:01:36.030> go<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.930> know<00:01:37.020> quite<00:01:37.229> as<00:01:37.350> good<00:01:37.470> as

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
actually go you know quite as good as

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.440 
actually go you know quite as good as
you<00:01:37.740> see<00:01:37.950> here<00:01:38.340> but<00:01:38.939> if<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.150> can<00:01:39.270> figure<00:01:39.360> that

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
you see here but if you can figure that

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.940 
you see here but if you can figure that
part<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:39.990> out<00:01:40.110> then<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.409> think<00:01:40.650> you've<00:01:40.799> got<00:01:40.920> a

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
part of it out then I think you've got a

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.200 
part of it out then I think you've got a
lot<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.310> enjoyment<00:01:41.610> out<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:41.880> it

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
lot of enjoyment out of it

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.789 
lot of enjoyment out of it
and<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.509> should<00:01:42.659> be<00:01:42.689> pretty<00:01:42.869> easy<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.439> use<00:01:43.619> it

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
and it should be pretty easy to use it

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.520 
and it should be pretty easy to use it
does<00:01:43.950> require<00:01:44.220> two<00:01:44.610> remote<00:01:45.030> two<00:01:46.020> double-a
