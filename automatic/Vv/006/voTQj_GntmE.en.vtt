00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.160
 means 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.230
 so on this eve of the comeback the 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.240
 first thing I do for myself 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.770
 to find is to write challenges or 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.330
 achievements that I want to make at 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.190
 current of the year in a notebook by 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.350
 example always listen in class 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.630
 always do my homework have some 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.610
 academic results higher than 80% 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.990
 in short anything that can we 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.990
 inspire got off to a good start 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.290
 if like me you are able to have 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.460
 your air in advance I advise to 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.290
 take the time to write it in your 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.060
 write diaries it's worth it 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.560
 what are your classes that are at what 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.750
 hour it will allow you to better 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.580
 know where I have the day of school and 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.830
 school organization side the words his 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.020
 hand of having visually in my 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.790
 agenda is what my schedule by cons 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.590
 if you do not have the opportunity to 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.210
 see to the advanced make sure at least of 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.440
 to know to which right you enter the 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.440
 next morning to wear 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.729
 to go out of the most important things to 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.380
 to do the eve of the return is by 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.420
 his school bag to be certain no 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.830
 become forget the same and especially if 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.270
 you are only me and you have 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.190
 tend to be a bit late then 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.899
 have less of that to prepare you the 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.380
 same morning but it makes me a step from 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.380
 means face 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.069
 this classic to prepare your clothes 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.750
 for the next day and me it makes me 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.000
 always an eternity to choose them 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.350
 seriously it takes me away from a group or on 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.350
 shoulders to abort the abbey 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.540
 he does not think I like it 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.739
 a storage treatment kit 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.300
 makeup with big all 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.610
 makeup essentials again 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.200
 because it facilitates the preparation 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.880
 morning you have all your things which 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.650
 you need at your fingertips and 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.000
 it allows me to create a small 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.620
 routine that finds that once again 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.040
 it's really convenient to speed up 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.040
 your morning 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.280
 a little piece of advice that I learned over 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.020
 of years these doctors cadres in 30 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.580
 minutes earlier for example if you 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.710
 have to get up at 7am put your 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.930
 dial at 6:30 am like this you have some 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.220
 difficulty getting up at least you 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.570
 have a little time in front of you 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.640
 morning and you will not be but big 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.410
 delay if you ever forgot about yourself 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:04.710
 to wake up or that you are too well one 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:06.540
 withdrew this imam shareholders but I like 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.130
 tonight in a room with the return 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.170
 I do not know why show me 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.970
 allows you to start the year well 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.290
 a clean room and I like highlights 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.150
 to make a small corner with mu is 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.610
 essential to use and to 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.260
 high school as pencil notebooks 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.490
 something like this mental septet the 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.490
 medrek that will motivate 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.510
 at that moment the majority of our 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.220
 preparation should be enough so the fact 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.900
 the time to relax I take this opportunity 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.690
 to watch a TV series yesterday 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.010
 family nail care family face 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.819
 to take a baby all because I 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.230
 know I'm going to have a little bit 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.370
 less time with the school that 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.170
 do not recognize that I benefit from it 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.170
 little to make me a story an axis 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.010
 and the last advice I have to you 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:57.359
 to give is to sleep a little more 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.980
 early than usual because it's 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:00.780
 almost assured that you're going to have some 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.060
 difficulty falling asleep so I have 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.620
 better predict the shot and try to have 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.790
 a little more sleep and 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.170
 tell me in the comments 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.799
 what time do you go to bed when 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.799
 you have school 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.709
 and according to the video forgets to have 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.329
 such a flop subscribe is not already 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.340
 done you can also to sir sow 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.750
 social networks to see arms but 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.310
 if you are in the videos and we 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.920
 let's build in this tragedy at the bar 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.430
 your lease and after that you will deserve the 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.430
 technical 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.270
 when you boe
