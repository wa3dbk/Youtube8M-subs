today<00:02:16.810> everybody<00:02:17.200> so<00:02:17.380> I<00:02:17.410> think<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.830> whole

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
today everybody so I think the whole

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.580 
today everybody so I think the whole
impulse<00:02:18.910> for<00:02:19.239> the<00:02:19.330> first<00:02:19.569> time<00:02:19.840> maybe<00:02:20.050> was<00:02:20.319> so

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
impulse for the first time maybe was so

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.340 
impulse for the first time maybe was so
whole<00:02:21.100> from<00:02:21.819> the<00:02:21.940> band<00:02:22.150> to<00:02:22.569> start<00:02:22.810> with<00:02:22.959> and

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
whole from the band to start with and

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.740 
whole from the band to start with and
actually<00:02:23.739> fact<00:02:24.069> having<00:02:24.310> frankly<00:02:24.880> coming<00:02:25.600> in

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
actually fact having frankly coming in

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.930 
actually fact having frankly coming in
last<00:02:26.050> summer<00:02:26.380> we<00:02:26.860> were<00:02:27.010> able<00:02:27.130> to<00:02:27.280> rehearse<00:02:27.700> the

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
last summer we were able to rehearse the

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.090 
last summer we were able to rehearse the
songs<00:02:28.209> together<00:02:28.420> with<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:28.959> singer<00:02:29.380> you<00:02:29.590> know

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
songs together with the singer you know

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.699 
songs together with the singer you know
and<00:02:30.430> and<00:02:31.239> therefore<00:02:31.930> we<00:02:32.260> were<00:02:32.410> able<00:02:32.560> to

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
and and therefore we were able to

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.190 
and and therefore we were able to
actually<00:02:33.010> get<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.690> arrangements<00:02:34.690> totally

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
actually get the arrangements totally

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.720 
actually get the arrangements totally
the<00:02:35.290> new<00:02:35.470> level<00:02:35.860> and<00:02:36.070> I<00:02:36.310> think<00:02:36.340> we'd<00:02:36.610> never

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
the new level and I think we'd never

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.900 
the new level and I think we'd never
been<00:02:37.000> so<00:02:37.239> prepared<00:02:37.810> for<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:38.560> studio<00:02:38.920> when<00:02:39.790> we
