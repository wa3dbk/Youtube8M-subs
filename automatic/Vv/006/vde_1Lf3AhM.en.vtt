 Angel the plastic carotid artery 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.830
 thousands of people around the world. 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.800
 world suffers a stroke 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.929
 cerebral in its most common form 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.299
 occurs due to obstruction of one or more 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.460
 arteries compromising the flow 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.300
 blood for a particular part of the 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.250
 brain 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.199
 depending on the extent of brain damage 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.019
 the patient may be left with sequelae 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.170
 severe or even die 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.359
 there is little to do to treat abc 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.030
 therefore prevention is the most 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.100
 powerful in combating this disease 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.890
 the main arteries involved in the 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.899
 cerebral circulation are the carotid 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.629
 the formation of cholesterol plaques and 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.910
 calcium in these arteries that is accelerated 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.030
 by smoking for hypertension 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.120
 for diabetes and dyslipidemias is 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.340
 a preventable source of avc through 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.230
 echocardiography of carotid arteries is 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.420
 detect these cards and 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.090
 determine the degree of narrowing that 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.309
 are causing in vessel light from 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.500
 of a certain limit is indicated 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.900
 correction of narrowing by both 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.540
 surgery with the removal of plaque as 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.220
 by angioplasty where narrowing is 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.729
 corrected by placement of a stent 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.560
 within the vessel angioplasty is 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.930
 offered to patients that the risk 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.939
 for surgery is very high and 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.979
 especially in cases where the 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.869
 surgery is technically difficult 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.939
 due to the location of the 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.310
 example with local anesthesia 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.259
 catheterization is done in the femoral artery 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.570
 just above the groin 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.939
 using catheters or such material 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.340
 implanted is taken to the place of 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.740
 narrowing of the carotid artery to 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.960
 avoid during catheterization pieces 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.790
 the plate are fragmented by going to 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.729
 inside the brain we use 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.040
 devices for brain protection after 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.290
 placing the protective device on the 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.240
 stent is then released exactly at the 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.969
 narrowing site covering 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.189
 completely the atherosclerotic plaque 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.229
