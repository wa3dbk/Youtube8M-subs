00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:10.760
 It's okay, girls. I discovered a noise. 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:13.210
 everything right near the window came in like 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.259
 that the avenue might be a 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.939
 video games and cars 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:18.619
 But I'll try to speak loudly to 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:21.619
 you listen in the video 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:24.019
 today I came to record until and what's in the 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:27.320
 my purse the purse I'm using 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:30.289
 This is the one I bought in SÃ£o Paulo 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.739
 March 25 of course everything would do for 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:36.890
 where I'll col if I'm using more 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.900
 I tried to separate and leave the 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.900
 things that were already in her that I ended up 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.979
 of arriving and the things that I really 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.799
 day-to-day use 

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:48.409
 if there is one thing that can not be lacking in 

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:49.790
 My purse is absorbing. I hate you. 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:52.339
 take care off 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.989
 so I always have to have absorbent 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:58.699
 inside the bag here 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.010
 something else that does not come out of my 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.260
 because it's good for a lot of people 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.220
 Everyone has to have it is mine. 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.790
 Wallet 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:10.220
 mine is this little fruit here she's here 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.240
 It has a good sound and here I keep mine. 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.160
 ID cards and saved money 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.770
 always have a saved money pocket 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.450
 that left him latent not to touch him to 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.310
 some emergency 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.200
 Another thing that never came out of my 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.780
 not exactly purse bag it 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.290
 really never get away from me is the 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:33.110
 my phone along with his loaded 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:36.200
 that also does not go out of my pocket 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:39.140
 the headset I do not know is in a 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.200
 Bus waiting in doctor for something 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.200
 without listening to music 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.000
 Let me see more of my mail 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.010
 also does not come out of my purse she's not 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.960
 with almost nothing in here because I 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.120
 I took out when I got there, I saved it. 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.960
 dresser then not to mess 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:59.840
 I left this other 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.670
 I also need medicine and 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.750
 these little things inside 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.570
 usually they have remedy has a 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.240
 enough moisturizer has a perfume 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.830
 The neighbor's display is also always 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.080
 same in here for some emergency 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.450
 I do not walk around on the bag because 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.330
 I'm allergic then not all kinds of 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.280
 medicine, I can use something else that 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.230
 Do not be together with the iphone and sometimes 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.320
 It's not in my bag, but I have to 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.510
 There's always that little dump here. 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.760
 carry the iphone you carry it on 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.660
 and she carries her cell phone when she 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.660
 the battery is running out 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:42.600
 shifting focus one thing that I always 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:45.300
 I have a business, they're my business. 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.130
 is not necessarily just because 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.290
 I have smaller passbooks for when 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.500
 I played paper pad for when 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.870
 I have with another bag the blog cards 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.940
 This is where the old ones are still the new ones. 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.860
 almost ended up in perth 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.880
 some are still in there in the other 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.880
 card point 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:08.430
 I always have in my bag those 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:11.670
 entrepreneurs and today is beautiful and also the 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.620
 point-of-view type you see in your 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.290
 town right here in my city calls 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.170
 Make up the elastic be the way you want it 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:22.920
 call my bag also can not 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:25.890
 lacking a dark glasses because I did not 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.720
 I knew it was very sunny so it's me. 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.060
 I'm very uncomfortable because the view has a 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.980
 difficult problem only bothers and 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.290
 I have to always wear glasses 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.160
 also has always in my bag a pen 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.890
 drive 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:42.260
 This one here is beautiful, it's a 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.260
 camera he is like this 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.180
 and this is what is most vague at the moment 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:52.230
 that's why I'm using it's get 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:56.580
 more space and a thing is more vague 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:58.440
 which always stays in my bag, I 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.900
 Shooting things here we because I 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.909
 played up here but by the time I 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.769
 If I were to take you out, I'd 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:06.780
 mess that grip 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.610
 so it does not give a thing that I always 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.799
 I have in my bag is the box of 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.970
 my appliance and I removed the 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:17.459
 but there still retaining device 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.949
 Enamel remover wipes do not 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.260
 nothing worse than the peeling enamel and 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:24.449
 you're going to a point that will not go 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:28.440
 to roll that nail all ugly you have to 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:30.449
 removing these tissues is the solution 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.150
 I carry the handkerchiefs too. 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:35.669
 moistened because I have no klamt 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.430
 biphasic but not every place to take and 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:40.500
 sometimes non- emergency tattooed skin 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.820
 something like this here are also 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.250
 very useful 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:48.330
 my toothbrush can not 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.770
 missing because I use the device I still 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.229
 lower use 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.599
 So I got this addiction from 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:59.070
 anything brush your teeth for 

00:04:54.599 --> 00:05:01.770
 good girls cause of the appliance 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:04.169
 I think it's the things I 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:09.330
 I have it here, let me see if there's any 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:12.599
 Purse thing just got polio but I 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.849
 i showed the iphone because that's what i live 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:16.590
 you can download much more 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:18.990
 fast than my iphone do not know why 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.370
 so sometimes I do not have it with him 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.889
 more training in the gym then sometimes 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.110
 I forget him over the bed. 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:27.930
 something like that but these things that 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:30.110
 I'm showing you this whole thing. 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.400
 It's what I really carry in my purse. 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.169
 depending on how often I carry a 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.440
 gloomy when the weather is not very 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:39.539
 legal and not everywhere I take everything 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.090
 this is clear to other places not 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:44.039
 takes other things but this is what has 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.139
 in my day- to-day purse were the 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:47.660
 The things I took now are just 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:49.460
 It's necessary that you have nothing. 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:52.160
 so why I took things for 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.630
 body and if you also 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.030
 I want you to do a video telling me 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:59.630
 because I carry it in this series that is 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:01.400
 day-to-day purse or travel out there is 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.440
 Only you would leave here did not comment that 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.030
 I'll know, it's okay. I hope you all 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.060
 Did you like to know what I carry? 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:12.370

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.370
