in the handling in this video van in the
other<00:00:18.390> while<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:18.750> then<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:19.020> review<00:00:19.380> video

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
other while and then the review video

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.250 
other while and then the review video
and<00:00:20.000> yeah<00:00:21.000> of<00:00:21.060> course<00:00:21.270> physical<00:00:21.750> videos<00:00:21.990> for

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.529 
and yeah of course physical videos for
the<00:00:22.380> other<00:00:22.529> series<00:00:22.949> so<00:00:23.160> then<00:00:23.340> nicer<00:00:24.119> shot<00:00:24.390> that

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
the other series so then nicer shot that

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.630 
the other series so then nicer shot that
over<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:25.109> grid<00:00:25.320> grown<00:00:25.920> up<00:00:26.010> hype<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.340> straight

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
over the grid grown up hype and straight

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.890 
over the grid grown up hype and straight
wheel<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:26.970> grid<00:00:27.090> then<00:00:27.240> full<00:00:27.510> throttle

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
wheel to the grid then full throttle

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.570 
wheel to the grid then full throttle
start<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.560> pretty<00:00:28.859> safely<00:00:29.099> do<00:00:29.279> that<00:00:29.400> little

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
start and pretty safely do that little

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.919 
start and pretty safely do that little
bit<00:00:29.760> be<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.060> little<00:00:30.090> bit<00:00:30.330> smoke<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:30.750> rest<00:00:30.869> of

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
bit be a little bit smoke and rest of

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.080 
bit be a little bit smoke and rest of
the<00:00:30.990> cars<00:00:31.170> on<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.410> grid<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:32.610> we're<00:00:32.880> away

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
the cars on the grid and that we're away

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.990 
the cars on the grid and that we're away
then<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:34.130> traction<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.280> very<00:00:35.670> similar<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:35.940> what

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
then so traction is very similar to what

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.030 
then so traction is very similar to what
it's<00:00:36.149> an<00:00:36.239> f1<00:00:36.540> this<00:00:36.719> this<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.800> doesn't

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
it's an f1 this this it doesn't

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.680 
it's an f1 this this it doesn't
particularly<00:00:38.370> slow<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:38.850> down<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.329> get<00:00:39.480> wheels

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
particularly slow you down to get wheels

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.569 
particularly slow you down to get wheels
but<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:39.989> does<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.350> slide<00:00:40.950> sideways<00:00:41.219> but

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
but it does to slide sideways but

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:42.740 
but it does to slide sideways but
doesn't<00:00:41.820> stick<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:41.969> throw<00:00:42.149> down<00:00:42.270> is<00:00:42.450> trying<00:00:42.690> to

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
doesn't stick to throw down is trying to

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.330 
doesn't stick to throw down is trying to
be<00:00:42.809> quite<00:00:42.960> clean<00:00:43.200> through<00:00:43.350> there<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.649> that

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
be quite clean through there and that

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.500 
be quite clean through there and that
all<00:00:44.460> assists<00:00:44.760> are<00:00:44.879> off<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.180> tracks<00:00:45.390> with

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
all assists are off the tracks with

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.799 
all assists are off the tracks with
doors<00:00:45.660> off<00:00:45.780> abs<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.289> off<00:00:46.440> everything's<00:00:46.860> off

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
doors off abs is off everything's off

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.360 
doors off abs is off everything's off
visual<00:00:48.809> only<00:00:49.020> damage<00:00:49.289> as<00:00:49.410> well<00:00:49.440> each<00:00:50.100> other

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
visual only damage as well each other

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.250 
visual only damage as well each other
we'll<00:00:50.640> see<00:00:50.820> an<00:00:51.480> example<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:51.870> later<00:00:52.079> in<00:00:52.170> the

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
we'll see an example of later in the

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.889 
we'll see an example of later in the
video<00:00:52.320> unfortunately<00:00:52.559> okay<00:00:53.399> but<00:00:54.210> it's<00:00:54.660> inside

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
video unfortunately okay but it's inside

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.569 
video unfortunately okay but it's inside
now<00:00:55.020> this<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.260> also<00:00:55.469> very<00:00:55.649> hard<00:00:56.010> AI<00:00:56.160> which<00:00:56.460> is

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
now this is also very hard AI which is

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.610 
now this is also very hard AI which is
the<00:00:56.670> top<00:00:56.820> AI<00:00:57.030> difficulty<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.780> understand<00:00:58.500> they

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
the top AI difficulty I understand they

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.979 
the top AI difficulty I understand they
haven't<00:00:58.920> been<00:00:59.070> fully<00:00:59.280> tweet<00:00:59.609> yet<00:00:59.960> they<00:01:00.960> are

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
haven't been fully tweet yet they are

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.510 
haven't been fully tweet yet they are
different<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.710> know<00:01:01.859> which<00:01:02.010> series<00:01:02.370> you're

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
different to know which series you're

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.039 
different to know which series you're
burning<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:02.879> causes<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.300> be<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.510> open-wheel<00:01:03.870> a

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
burning so causes to be the open-wheel a

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.560 
burning so causes to be the open-wheel a
height<00:01:04.880> and<00:01:05.880> then<00:01:05.970> we<00:01:06.090> see<00:01:06.210> what<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.390> wanting

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
height and then we see what you wanting

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
height and then we see what you wanting
to<00:01:06.689> be<00:01:06.780> various<00:01:07.439> AI<00:01:07.619> so<00:01:08.580> then<00:01:08.760> after<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.450> hill

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
to be various AI so then after the hill

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.719 
to be various AI so then after the hill
would<00:01:10.590> have<00:01:10.680> sent<00:01:10.890> place<00:01:11.070> from<00:01:11.220> sixty<00:01:11.610> percent

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
would have sent place from sixty percent

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.190 
would have sent place from sixty percent
a<00:01:11.939> three-lap<00:01:12.299> race<00:01:12.330> center<00:01:12.750> not<00:01:12.869> too<00:01:12.900> many

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
second I could quite confidently get I

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.720 
second I could quite confidently get I
reckon<00:02:16.110> but<00:02:17.110> yeah<00:02:17.500> wins<00:02:17.920> is<00:02:18.100> so<00:02:18.280> so<00:02:18.460> hard<00:02:18.610> to

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
reckon but yeah wins is so so hard to

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:19.650 
reckon but yeah wins is so so hard to
get<00:02:18.820> because<00:02:18.880> they<00:02:19.060> are<00:02:19.180> quit<00:02:19.360> I<00:02:19.390> was<00:02:19.510> about<00:02:19.600> a

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
get because they are quit I was about a

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.360 
get because they are quit I was about a
second<00:02:19.930> a<00:02:19.990> lot<00:02:20.110> quicker<00:02:20.320> than<00:02:20.470> them<00:02:20.650> so<00:02:21.130> longer

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
second a lot quicker than them so longer

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.310 
second a lot quicker than them so longer
waits<00:02:21.520> I<00:02:21.580> probably<00:02:21.730> got<00:02:22.030> them<00:02:22.180> but<00:02:22.720> a<00:02:22.750> second

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
waits I probably got them but a second

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.720 
waits I probably got them but a second
isn't<00:02:23.440> too<00:02:23.620> much<00:02:23.770> really<00:02:23.980> considering<00:02:24.460> you

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
isn't too much really considering you

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.950 
isn't too much really considering you
know<00:02:24.760> that<00:02:25.360> uh<00:02:26.970> there<00:02:27.970> is<00:02:28.090> a<00:02:28.120> short<00:02:28.540> race<00:02:28.720> in

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
know that uh there is a short race in

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.270 
know that uh there is a short race in
that<00:02:29.080> course<00:02:29.290> wishes<00:02:29.680> himself<00:02:29.980> on<00:02:30.070> the<00:02:30.130> back

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
that course wishes himself on the back

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.100 
that course wishes himself on the back
so<00:02:30.580> I<00:02:30.610> don't<00:02:30.910> know<00:02:31.150> how<00:02:31.240> the<00:02:31.300> air<00:02:31.510> would<00:02:31.750> be<00:02:31.780> if

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
so I don't know how the air would be if

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.510 
so I don't know how the air would be if
there's<00:02:32.350> any<00:02:32.470> kind<00:02:32.620> of<00:02:32.740> catch<00:02:32.920> up<00:02:33.160> when<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.400> VA

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
there's any kind of catch up when the VA

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.940 
there's any kind of catch up when the VA
I<00:02:33.640> would<00:02:34.300> be<00:02:34.420> a<00:02:34.450> bit<00:02:34.600> bit<00:02:35.530> quicker<00:02:35.740> if<00:02:35.890> I

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
I would be a bit bit quicker if I

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.500 
I would be a bit bit quicker if I
qualified<00:02:36.430> higher<00:02:36.640> at<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:36.820> grid<00:02:37.000> I'm<00:02:37.240> not<00:02:37.330> too

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
qualified higher at the grid I'm not too

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.500 
qualified higher at the grid I'm not too
sure<00:02:37.690> but<00:02:37.930> there<00:02:38.650> we<00:02:38.740> go<00:02:38.920> so<00:02:39.180> yeah<00:02:40.180> I've<00:02:40.360> had<00:02:40.480> a

wasn't minutes video at least and yet so
the<00:03:07.720> hamden<00:03:07.989> then<00:03:08.140> as<00:03:08.320> you<00:03:08.470> saw<00:03:08.650> that<00:03:08.860> big<00:03:09.190> spin

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
the hamden then as you saw that big spin

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.460 
the hamden then as you saw that big spin
almost<00:03:09.940> spun<00:03:10.180> it<00:03:10.300> manish<00:03:10.720> yet<00:03:10.870> so<00:03:11.050> don't<00:03:11.230> just

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
almost spun it manish yet so don't just

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.690 
almost spun it manish yet so don't just
shake<00:03:11.650> hard<00:03:11.920> to<00:03:12.070> help<00:03:12.130> around<00:03:12.340> the<00:03:12.430> corner

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
shake hard to help around the corner

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.780 
shake hard to help around the corner
that

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
that

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.009 
that
a<00:03:13.819> lot<00:03:14.090> of<00:03:14.120> control<00:03:14.390> pretty<00:03:14.599> much<00:03:14.719> there<00:03:14.900> was

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
a lot of control pretty much there was

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:16.869 
a lot of control pretty much there was
like<00:03:15.200> handling<00:03:15.980> it's<00:03:16.219> actually<00:03:16.459> really<00:03:16.670> nice

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879 
like handling it's actually really nice

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:19.449 
like handling it's actually really nice
I<00:03:17.510> played<00:03:18.140> while<00:03:18.650> likes<00:03:18.799> a<00:03:18.890> 30<00:03:19.099> foot<00:03:19.280> race<00:03:19.430> to

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
I played while likes a 30 foot race to

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.339

many of the other disciplines purely

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.390 
many of the other disciplines purely
exist<00:03:24.349> this<00:03:24.469> was<00:03:24.650> this<00:03:24.799> was<00:03:24.859> the<00:03:25.040> most<00:03:25.189> fun

lot of sliding gun not rear end sliding
sips<00:03:29.569> you've<00:03:29.719> really<00:03:29.959> effective<00:03:30.260> as<00:03:30.319> I<00:03:30.409> was

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
sips you've really effective as I was

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.420 
sips you've really effective as I was
hopefully<00:03:30.709> we'll<00:03:30.799> see<00:03:30.829> down<00:03:31.069> as<00:03:31.189> straight<00:03:31.400> a

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
hopefully we'll see down as straight a

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.599 
hopefully we'll see down as straight a
little<00:03:31.609> bit<00:03:32.680> ba<00:03:33.680> you<00:03:33.829> can<00:03:34.010> really<00:03:34.189> drew<00:03:34.459> the

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:34.609 
little bit ba you can really drew the

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:36.099 
little bit ba you can really drew the
cars<00:03:34.819> at<00:03:34.939> Corrin<00:03:35.269> not<00:03:35.480> really<00:03:35.689> suffer<00:03:35.959> too

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:36.109 
cars at Corrin not really suffer too

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:38.229 
cars at Corrin not really suffer too
much<00:03:36.140> lap<00:03:36.500> time<00:03:36.739> because<00:03:37.579> of<00:03:37.670> it<00:03:37.760> so<00:03:37.909> just<00:03:38.120> just

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
much lap time because of it so just just

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:39.819 
much lap time because of it so just just
boots<00:03:38.540> out<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:38.810> corner<00:03:39.109> just<00:03:39.290> just<00:03:39.709> have<00:03:39.799> a

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
boots out the corner just just have a

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:41.500 
boots out the corner just just have a
nice<00:03:39.980> drift<00:03:40.250> on<00:03:40.400> but<00:03:40.609> you<00:03:40.700> can<00:03:40.939> go<00:03:41.150> too<00:03:41.209> far

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
nice drift on but you can go too far

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.390 
nice drift on but you can go too far
it's<00:03:41.720> it's<00:03:41.900> not<00:03:42.079> too<00:03:42.349> forgiving<00:03:42.799> there's<00:03:43.370> a

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
it's it's not too forgiving there's a

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.709 
it's it's not too forgiving there's a
big<00:03:43.519> spin<00:03:43.849> or<00:03:43.939> head<00:03:44.090> luck<00:03:44.269> missing<00:03:44.510> off<00:03:44.599> the

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:44.719 
big spin or head luck missing off the

circuits or not the problem there we go

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.039 
circuits or not the problem there we go
lots<00:03:46.430> always<00:03:46.670> been<00:03:46.849> you<00:03:47.389> see<00:03:47.599> the<00:03:47.689> front<00:03:47.840> moves

fan of the drift series of you know
actually<00:04:14.480> drifting<00:04:15.079> in<00:04:15.169> a<00:04:15.230> car<00:04:15.409> as<00:04:15.650> an<00:04:16.039> event<00:04:16.310> i

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
actually drifting in a car as an event i

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.670 
actually drifting in a car as an event i
just<00:04:17.090> i<00:04:17.389> don't<00:04:17.539> like<00:04:17.840> that<00:04:18.139> that<00:04:18.409> sort<00:04:18.590> of

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
just i don't like that that sort of

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.990 
just i don't like that that sort of
event<00:04:18.859> doesn't<00:04:19.130> particularly<00:04:19.430> trust<00:04:19.699> me<00:04:19.820> but

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
event doesn't particularly trust me but

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.520 
event doesn't particularly trust me but
I'd<00:04:20.209> you<00:04:20.449> know<00:04:20.570> drifting<00:04:21.019> holidays<00:04:21.349> always

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
I'd you know drifting holidays always

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.620 
I'd you know drifting holidays always
fun<00:04:21.709> as<00:04:21.829> I'm<00:04:21.949> cut<00:04:22.099> the<00:04:22.220> corner<00:04:22.490> there<00:04:22.639> and<00:04:22.820> you

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
fun as I'm cut the corner there and you

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.110 
fun as I'm cut the corner there and you
do<00:04:23.810> get<00:04:23.990> corner-cutting<00:04:24.820> penalties<00:04:25.820> as<00:04:25.940> well

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
do get corner-cutting penalties as well

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.930 
do get corner-cutting penalties as well
I<00:04:26.330> think<00:04:26.659> it's<00:04:27.229> a<00:04:27.289> spinner<00:04:27.530> ahead<00:04:27.860> and<00:04:28.430> the<00:04:28.880> air

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
I think it's a spinner ahead and the air

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.100 
I think it's a spinner ahead and the air
of<00:04:29.090> course<00:04:29.300> didn't<00:04:29.510> see<00:04:29.630> if<00:04:29.690> you<00:04:29.750> make<00:04:29.870> quite<00:04:30.050> a

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
of course didn't see if you make quite a

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.480 
of course didn't see if you make quite a
few<00:04:30.260> mistakes<00:04:30.380> about<00:04:30.710> which<00:04:30.919> it's<00:04:31.039> also<00:04:31.159> good

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
few mistakes about which it's also good

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.300 
few mistakes about which it's also good
to<00:04:31.520> see<00:04:31.849> but<00:04:32.690> yes<00:04:33.289> handling<00:04:33.710> great<00:04:33.919> fun<00:04:34.099> not

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
to see but yes handling great fun not

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.529 
to see but yes handling great fun not
particularly<00:04:34.699> realistic<00:04:35.060> but<00:04:35.210> doesn't<00:04:35.479> this

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:35.539 
particularly realistic but doesn't this

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:37.629 
particularly realistic but doesn't this
game<00:04:35.720> was<00:04:35.840> going<00:04:35.960> for<00:04:36.169> that<00:04:36.199> but<00:04:36.530> I<00:04:36.710> would<00:04:37.430> say

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
game was going for that but I would say

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:39.909 
game was going for that but I would say
it's<00:04:38.150> not<00:04:38.419> so<00:04:38.750> unrealistic<00:04:39.289> that<00:04:39.530> you<00:04:39.830> know

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
it's not so unrealistic that you know

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:41.980 
it's not so unrealistic that you know
someone<00:04:40.250> like<00:04:40.310> me<00:04:40.490> looks<00:04:41.120> like<00:04:41.300> Sims<00:04:41.599> wouldn't

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
someone like me looks like Sims wouldn't

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.060 
someone like me looks like Sims wouldn't
want<00:04:42.110> to<00:04:42.169> play<00:04:42.289> it<00:04:42.440> you<00:04:42.530> know<00:04:42.650> it's<00:04:42.800> just<00:04:42.889> good

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
want to play it you know it's just good

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.370 
want to play it you know it's just good
fun<00:04:43.280> it's<00:04:43.610> um<00:04:43.940> looking<00:04:44.720> for<00:04:44.840> realism<00:04:45.050> this<00:04:45.289> is

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
fun it's um looking for realism this is

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.860 
fun it's um looking for realism this is
not<00:04:45.530> the<00:04:45.650> game<00:04:45.740> for<00:04:45.949> you<00:04:46.539> but<00:04:47.539> this<00:04:47.570> particular

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
not the game for you but this particular

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.810 
not the game for you but this particular
series<00:04:48.199> it's<00:04:48.710> probably<00:04:49.039> the<00:04:49.159> most<00:04:49.460> realistic

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
series it's probably the most realistic

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.430 
series it's probably the most realistic
you<00:04:50.150> you're<00:04:50.360> going<00:04:50.539> to<00:04:50.630> get<00:04:50.720> in<00:04:50.840> this<00:04:50.930> game<00:04:51.229> I'd
