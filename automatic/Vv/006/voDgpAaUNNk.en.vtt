00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:47.540 
was gonna create a shelter I'd start

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.270 
was gonna create a shelter I'd start
with<00:00:47.600> the<00:00:47.660> base<00:00:47.930> now<00:00:48.800> we<00:00:48.860> need<00:00:49.040> to<00:00:49.100> start

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
with the base now we need to start

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.120 
with the base now we need to start
focusing<00:00:49.399> on<00:00:49.700> fire<00:00:50.200> in<00:00:51.200> a<00:00:51.890> lot<00:00:52.100> of

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:52.130 
focusing on fire in a lot of

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.860 
focusing on fire in a lot of
environments<00:00:52.340> you're<00:00:52.820> gonna<00:00:52.910> have<00:00:53.180> you're

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
environments you're gonna have you're

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:54.910 
environments you're gonna have you're
not<00:00:53.989> gonna<00:00:54.110> be<00:00:54.230> able<00:00:54.290> to<00:00:54.380> find<00:00:54.620> the<00:00:54.739> type<00:00:54.890> of

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
not gonna be able to find the type of

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.650 
not gonna be able to find the type of
kindling<00:00:55.430> that<00:00:55.610> we<00:00:55.850> were<00:00:55.940> able<00:00:56.030> to<00:00:56.149> find<00:00:56.420> here

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
kindling that we were able to find here

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.360 
kindling that we were able to find here
and<00:00:56.809> so<00:00:57.469> a<00:00:57.500> lot<00:00:57.800> of<00:00:57.829> times<00:00:58.010> you'll<00:00:58.129> have<00:00:58.280> to

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
and so a lot of times you'll have to

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.910 
and so a lot of times you'll have to
split<00:00:58.700> I<00:00:59.050> just<00:01:00.050> went<00:01:00.230> right<00:01:00.290> through<00:01:00.440> it<00:01:00.770> look

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
split I just went right through it look

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.650 
split I just went right through it look
at<00:01:01.010> that<00:01:01.450> no<00:01:02.450> flexing<00:01:03.610> nothing<00:01:04.610> let's<00:01:05.509> go

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:05.660 
at that no flexing nothing let's go

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
at that no flexing nothing let's go
ahead<00:01:05.750> and<00:01:05.930> do<00:01:05.990> some<00:01:06.170> splitting<00:01:06.590> this<00:01:06.710> way<00:01:08.680> I'm

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
ahead and do some splitting this way I'm

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.260 
ahead and do some splitting this way I'm
gonna<00:01:09.800> put<00:01:09.979> on<00:01:10.130> out<00:01:10.280> to<00:01:10.430> the<00:01:10.490> back<00:01:10.729> end<00:01:11.000> of<00:01:11.119> this

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
gonna put on out to the back end of this

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.990 
gonna put on out to the back end of this
or<00:01:11.509> the<00:01:11.630> tip<00:01:11.810> end<00:01:11.990> of<00:01:12.110> this<00:01:12.610> I'm<00:01:13.610> not<00:01:13.789> even

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
or the tip end of this I'm not even

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.419 
or the tip end of this I'm not even
hitting<00:01:14.119> this<00:01:14.330> very<00:01:14.539> hard<00:01:14.750> at<00:01:14.840> all<00:01:15.369> notice<00:01:16.369> I

00:01:16.419 --> 00:01:16.429
