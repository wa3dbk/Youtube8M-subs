00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:07.750
 they are going to present the dry cheese and I 

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:09.280
 I'm going to drive the video and my partner 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.510
 for nadal be our understandings 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.510
 as if they do not make their sacks 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:19.100
 here we have the case the fresh cheese and 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:22.100
 fenced to have it so we had to 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.950
 put on a blanket 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:30.760
 we will hang the hunger for a blanket of 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.760
 tail for the cheese to destine the serum 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:37.940
 good right now let someone going 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:41.020
 so that it stays well kneaded and that 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.020
 he has a brain 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.680
 because we are going to take a little bit of 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.850
 some people prefer this better 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.580
 without cream but most of 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.180
 people throw cream on him so he has 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.180
 a flavour 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.290
 good they already have weight 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:37.460
 we have it well that we do carlos 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:43.790
 and this and then we're going to take a 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:43.790
 container so that with that already dry 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.729
 right now we're going to take on this is 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.729
 feel 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:11.250
 you have to think about it well for what 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.250
 the serum to dry well 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:17.830
 and if there is any residue of 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.830
 serum there sometimes to get them out 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.830
 and 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.820
 well after we have the cheese in 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:42.640
 we are going to attack this vessel with 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:45.690
 a few sheets of laps for what 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.190
 this can not the other animal flies 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.670
 it is important to know that you have to 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.410
 cover with laps and not as with 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.209
 aluminum because aluminum is going to 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.900
 get more innova that will not stay 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.900
 dried 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:12.940
 dry it takes 30 days 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.340
 no longer needed 2010 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:19.020
 in ancient times people preferred 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:23.860
 this put the soccer fence cow 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:27.220
 so you will not arrive animals to 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:30.070
 stand the body and when I was 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.680
 ready just took the plage 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:37.530
 they removed the future 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.530
 and the yellow parts that came together 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:57.489
 what I had inside brand is achieved 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:04:04.109
 with a knife so they will not be left 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:04.109
 that fan and that the cheese will remain 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:12.450
 to conjunct to warn 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:14.870
 that a lot still occupy that environment 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.410
 method to make it makes a dry 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.709
 why 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:23.380
 when we bought that too 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:26.290
 we see a little yellow we save the 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.710
 people who made them used that 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.710
 process 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.880
 It is also we put this we can 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.370
 place something heavy on top of the leaf 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:43.200
 returned so that the weight can not go up 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.200
 and that it dries well 

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:57.669
 and so the one that now plays well settled and 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:57.669
 well caked 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:04.590
 important to know that dry cheese is 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:08.670
 one of the cheeses that greater this greater 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:11.790
 time has for its realization already 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:15.390
 that have to be made with milk 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:18.780
 the case after the fresh cheese put it 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:21.660
 approach to make dry cheese and so that 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:25.380
 the dried cheese finishes drying 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:27.300
 completely needs 30 days but to 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.340
 despite all the work that we have 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:32.460
 denounced that here makes a dry one of 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:35.450
 the best cheeses that people 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.450
 they make with milk 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.510
 this has been 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.510
 inside the theater 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:55.400
 between most people also 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:56.870
 he is put on cream when he is in the 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.660
 procedure of that card so that 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:02.480
 be creamy again by lifting a lot 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:05.530
 like a lot of cream but he does it so that 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.530
 you want rich 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.550
 you can also see who 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:13.060
 We are collecting a lot of cream so that the 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.060
 taste 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:21.630
 It is also important that the one who 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:24.150
 we have to be observing is almost 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:29.180
 every day to see if it has not 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:29.180
 hidden worms or I have something else 

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:53.570
 the cheese procedure 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:57.370
 as we have elaborated and it is a way 

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:57.370
 easy to laburar
