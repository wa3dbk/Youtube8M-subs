00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 I did not take the skit channel with a signal 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.049
 You with 12 agents and skateboard 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.300
 Do you remember drawing like you? 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.660
 make with a common stiletto allow 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.900
 view of a tape that is to be pasted 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:24.570
 and a corrective for you that I desire 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:29.750
 then he warns not to walk an extract of 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:34.800
 example if I walk alone in Borralha 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:40.950
 you on the choice you want again 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:49.649
 you walked promoting good you 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:52.559
 put it here it comes the collective 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.900
 you are passing a drawing that 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.360
 you want inside the example hole 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.060
 travel cut then now make one 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.390
 along the canal and neither has shown how 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.390
 stayed 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.640
 but in test tissues in one direction only 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.960
 just like that, it's just that you do not get 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.960
 very so beautiful 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:49.360
 while neither a tip you do not 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.700
 make the event a detail becomes more 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.490
 difficult only with team community 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:58.290
 To leave, the winner had very 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.290
 so I probably will not leave 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:40.630
 the player here as in line with a 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.630
 place and I have here 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.420
 O 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.390
 now a tip the day you will check 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.130
 because we take a good high school 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.950
 also be able to identify account that 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:22.040
 take time out goal always move in 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:25.520
 It was good since the voting there you guys 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:30.350
 How did you stay and now expect a lot and 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:32.330
 I ended up here with a good solvency ratio 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.330
 a few drops that is out is nothing to come 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.490
 all dirty but that's where you have to 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.560
 to dry well but the drawing does not 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.959
 I need to say simple 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.090
 that's it's like it was cute are you 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.980
 to like the river and let it 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.690
 say I liked youtube 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.880
 access our channel to see others of 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.880
 another novelty and that's it people up
