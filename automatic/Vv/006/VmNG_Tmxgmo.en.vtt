walking<00:06:25.360> oh<00:06:27.369> word<00:06:28.569> yeah<00:06:29.569> auto<00:06:29.899> correct<00:06:30.379> way<00:06:30.469> I

00:06:30.489 --> 00:06:30.499 
walking oh word yeah auto correct way I

00:06:30.499 --> 00:06:32.019 
walking oh word yeah auto correct way I
guess<00:06:30.919> it<00:06:31.039> wasn't<00:06:31.189> an<00:06:31.309> autocrat<00:06:31.819> cuz<00:06:31.939> he

00:06:32.019 --> 00:06:32.029 
guess it wasn't an autocrat cuz he

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:34.679 
guess it wasn't an autocrat cuz he
probably<00:06:32.209> wanted<00:06:32.479> the<00:06:32.599> other<00:06:32.749> super<00:06:33.229> but

00:06:34.679 --> 00:06:34.689 
probably wanted the other super but

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:39.219 
probably wanted the other super but
persuade<00:06:35.689> o<00:06:35.719> tht<00:06:36.139> trick<00:06:36.649> yeah<00:06:37.809> here<00:06:38.809> we<00:06:38.869> go<00:06:38.899> a

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:39.229 
persuade o tht trick yeah here we go a

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:42.879 
persuade o tht trick yeah here we go a
couple<00:06:39.979> of<00:06:40.099> my<00:06:40.309> logic
