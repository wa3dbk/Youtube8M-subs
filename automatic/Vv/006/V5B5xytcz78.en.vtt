okay<00:00:01.560> what<00:00:01.710> we<00:00:01.800> have<00:00:01.829> here<00:00:02.040> is<00:00:02.340> kind<00:00:02.520> of<00:00:02.670> a

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
okay what we have here is kind of a

call the band joist this is basically

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.950 
call the band joist this is basically
just<00:00:28.890> usually<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.340> 2<00:00:29.520> by<00:00:29.670> 10<00:00:29.910> or<00:00:29.940> a<00:00:30.090> 2<00:00:30.270> by<00:00:30.690> 12

run<00:00:33.450> across<00:00:34.050> from<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:34.920> can<00:00:35.460> see<00:00:35.610> this

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
run across from it so you can see this

cold air from leaking in what you might

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.190 
cold air from leaking in what you might
see<00:00:52.920> if<00:00:53.340> you've<00:00:54.300> got<00:00:54.390> an<00:00:54.510> existing<00:00:54.570> home<00:00:55.050> you

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.200 
see if you've got an existing home you

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.450 
see if you've got an existing home you
might<00:00:55.320> see<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.560> case<00:00:55.800> like<00:00:56.010> this<00:00:56.070> where

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
might see a case like this where

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.830 
might see a case like this where
somebody's<00:00:56.820> insulated<00:00:57.270> this<00:00:57.390> area<00:00:57.690> with

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
somebody's insulated this area with

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.990 
somebody's insulated this area with
fiberglass<00:00:58.140> insulation<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.760> wouldn't

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
fiberglass insulation and I wouldn't

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.850 
fiberglass insulation and I wouldn't
recommend<00:01:00.329> doing<00:01:00.540> that<00:01:00.809> if<00:01:01.170> you've<00:01:01.649> got

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 
recommend doing that if you've got

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.410 
recommend doing that if you've got
fiberglass<00:01:02.399> in<00:01:02.640> there<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:02.910> can<00:01:03.030> get<00:01:03.210> at

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
fiberglass in there and you can get at

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.119 
fiberglass in there and you can get at
it<00:01:03.570> remove<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.350> insulate<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.829> with<00:01:04.979> this

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
it remove it and insulate it with this

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.249 
it remove it and insulate it with this
foam<00:01:05.429> and<00:01:05.749> silicone<00:01:06.749> the<00:01:06.899> way<00:01:06.990> I'm<00:01:07.079> going<00:01:07.229> to

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:07.259 
foam and silicone the way I'm going to

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:09.950 
foam and silicone the way I'm going to
show<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.439> today<00:01:07.710> what<00:01:08.609> you<00:01:08.759> want<00:01:08.969> to<00:01:09.119> do<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:09.719> to

show you today what you want to do is to

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.859 
show you today what you want to do is to
seal<00:01:10.229> up<00:01:10.499> along<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.850> area<00:01:12.149> between<00:01:12.299> this<00:01:12.569> band

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
seal up along the area between this band

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.739 
seal up along the area between this band
joist<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.469> the<00:01:14.039> subfloor<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:14.729> then<00:01:15.509> along

00:01:15.739 --> 00:01:15.749 
joist and the subfloor and then along

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:17.809 
joist and the subfloor and then along
both<00:01:15.929> of<00:01:16.170> these<00:01:16.289> edges<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:16.979> along<00:01:17.459> the<00:01:17.639> bottom

00:01:17.809 --> 00:01:17.819 
both of these edges and along the bottom

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:20.120 
both of these edges and along the bottom
if<00:01:18.209> you've<00:01:18.959> got<00:01:19.109> a<00:01:19.139> block<00:01:19.439> or<00:01:19.709> a<00:01:19.740> concrete

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
if you've got a block or a concrete

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.489 
if you've got a block or a concrete
foundation<00:01:20.459> you<00:01:21.329> might<00:01:21.569> actually<00:01:21.780> have<00:01:22.200> an

00:01:22.489 --> 00:01:22.499 
foundation you might actually have an

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:25.520 
foundation you might actually have an
additional<00:01:23.100> board<00:01:23.399> laying<00:01:23.729> flat<00:01:24.119> on<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:25.259> top

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
additional board laying flat on this top

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.069 
additional board laying flat on this top
area<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.939> definitely<00:01:27.420> want<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.659> seal<00:01:27.869> up

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:28.079 
area you definitely want to seal up

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:29.749 
area you definitely want to seal up
between<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.709> and<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.130> concrete<00:01:29.579> foundation

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
between that and the concrete foundation

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.709 
between that and the concrete foundation
as<00:01:30.329> well<00:01:30.359> so<00:01:31.049> we'll<00:01:31.950> just<00:01:32.130> get<00:01:32.549> some<00:01:32.719> sealant

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:33.719 
as well so we'll just get some sealant

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:35.139 
as well so we'll just get some sealant
in<00:01:33.840> here<00:01:34.020> first

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
in here first

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:38.269 
in here first
and<00:01:36.149> this<00:01:37.139> again<00:01:37.350> keeps<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.740> cold<00:01:38.009> air<00:01:38.100> from

00:01:38.269 --> 00:01:38.279 
and this again keeps that cold air from

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:42.469 
and this again keeps that cold air from
coming<00:01:38.429> in<00:01:40.819> we've<00:01:41.819> got<00:01:41.850> here<00:01:42.179> is<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.270> piece<00:01:42.329> of
