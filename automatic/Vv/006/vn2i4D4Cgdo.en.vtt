normally<00:00:13.559> I<00:00:13.590> like<00:00:13.740> I<00:00:14.009> like<00:00:14.099> running<00:00:14.429> on

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
normally I like I like running on

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.799 
normally I like I like running on
inter's<00:00:14.910> one<00:00:15.089> there<00:00:15.240> you<00:00:15.570> know<00:00:15.690> the

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
inter's one there you know the

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.570 
inter's one there you know the
conditions<00:00:16.230> are<00:00:16.440> tough<00:00:16.800> but<00:00:16.980> all<00:00:17.130> weekend

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
conditions are tough but all weekend

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.040 
conditions are tough but all weekend
when<00:00:17.789> we<00:00:17.820> ran<00:00:18.029> into<00:00:18.180> as<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.510> just<00:00:18.690> couldn't<00:00:18.869> get

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
when we ran into as I just couldn't get

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.960 
when we ran into as I just couldn't get
the<00:00:19.109> tire<00:00:19.320> working<00:00:19.710> so<00:00:20.340> I'd<00:00:20.400> love<00:00:20.580> shutting<00:00:20.880> on

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
the tire working so I'd love shutting on

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.160 
the tire working so I'd love shutting on
the<00:00:21.029> front<00:00:21.210> in<00:00:21.300> low<00:00:21.420> speed<00:00:21.689> corners<00:00:22.020> in<00:00:22.109> the

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
the front in low speed corners in the

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.529 
the front in low speed corners in the
high-speed<00:00:22.590> I<00:00:22.650> had<00:00:22.800> oversteer<00:00:23.279> so<00:00:23.550> yeah<00:00:24.359> I

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
high-speed I had oversteer so yeah I

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.269 
high-speed I had oversteer so yeah I
just<00:00:24.840> couldn't<00:00:24.990> get<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.199> balance<00:00:25.529> so<00:00:25.680> i<00:00:25.710> really

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
just couldn't get a balance so i really

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.800 
just couldn't get a balance so i really
struggled<00:00:26.460> on<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:26.849> tire<00:00:27.060> there<00:00:27.449> was<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.570> part

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
struggled on that tire there was a part

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.240 
struggled on that tire there was a part
where<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.080> track<00:00:28.260> was<00:00:28.410> drier<00:00:28.650> so<00:00:28.890> that<00:00:29.039> the

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
where the track was drier so that the

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.589 
where the track was drier so that the
tires<00:00:29.490> are<00:00:29.670> graining<00:00:30.000> up<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.330> then<00:00:30.420> you<00:00:30.449> get

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
tires are graining up and then you get

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.959 
tires are graining up and then you get
to<00:00:30.660> part<00:00:31.019> one<00:00:31.320> part<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.650> circuit<00:00:32.009> just

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
to part one part of the circuit just

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.910 
to part one part of the circuit just
before<00:00:33.210> cops<00:00:33.450> where<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.780> was<00:00:33.870> quite<00:00:34.410> wet<00:00:34.649> so

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
before cops where it was quite wet so

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.979 
before cops where it was quite wet so
the<00:00:34.950> car<00:00:35.190> was<00:00:35.340> almost<00:00:35.640> aquaplaning<00:00:36.570> some

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
the car was almost aquaplaning some

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:46.690 
the car was almost aquaplaning some
sometimes

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.510 

I<00:00:46.760> don't<00:00:47.750> feel<00:00:47.960> that<00:00:47.990> I<00:00:48.320> favor<00:00:48.680> one<00:00:48.920> to<00:00:49.430> the

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
I don't feel that I favor one to the

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.890 
I don't feel that I favor one to the
other<00:00:49.550> thing<00:00:49.970> you<00:00:50.180> go<00:00:50.570> talking<00:00:50.990> home<00:00:51.370> before

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 
other thing you go talking home before

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.110 
other thing you go talking home before
unfortunately<00:00:53.900> before<00:00:53.990> I<00:00:54.230> got<00:00:54.380> to<00:00:54.670> formula<00:00:55.670> as

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
unfortunately before I got to formula as

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.580 
unfortunately before I got to formula as
when<00:00:56.330> I<00:00:56.360> left<00:00:56.510> for<00:00:56.570> one<00:00:56.900> there<00:00:57.110> changed<00:00:57.470> the

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
when I left for one there changed the

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.550 
when I left for one there changed the
circuit<00:00:57.950> to<00:00:58.100> what<00:00:59.000> it<00:00:59.120> is<00:00:59.150> today<00:00:59.270> and<00:00:59.840> the<00:01:00.410> old

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:00.560 
circuit to what it is today and the old

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.840 
circuit to what it is today and the old
circuit<00:01:00.800> used<00:01:01.070> to<00:01:01.130> go<00:01:01.250> all<00:01:01.280> the<00:01:01.490> way<00:01:01.520> out<00:01:01.610> into

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
circuit used to go all the way out into

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.940 
circuit used to go all the way out into
the<00:01:01.970> forest<00:01:02.180> and<00:01:02.480> it<00:01:02.630> was<00:01:02.780> pretty<00:01:03.380> awesome<00:01:03.590> and

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:03.950 
the forest and it was pretty awesome and

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.130 
the forest and it was pretty awesome and
then<00:01:04.280> you<00:01:04.370> go<00:01:04.460> to<00:01:04.520> the<00:01:04.810> Nurburgring<00:01:05.810> where

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
then you go to the Nurburgring where

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.350 
then you go to the Nurburgring where
this<00:01:06.740> great<00:01:07.220> history<00:01:07.520> it's<00:01:07.970> got<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:08.180> North

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
this great history it's got the North

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.240 
this great history it's got the North
life<00:01:08.570> next<00:01:08.780> next<00:01:09.140> door<00:01:09.260> to<00:01:09.410> it<00:01:09.440> which<00:01:09.710> is<00:01:09.860> one

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
life next next door to it which is one

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.440 
life next next door to it which is one
of<00:01:10.280> the<00:01:10.400> best<00:01:10.580> circus<00:01:10.850> in<00:01:10.970> the<00:01:11.000> world<00:01:11.210> if<00:01:11.330> not

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
of the best circus in the world if not

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.280 
of the best circus in the world if not
the<00:01:11.600> best<00:01:11.750> circuit<00:01:12.610> and<00:01:13.610> it's<00:01:14.270> it's<00:01:14.900> again

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
the best circuit and it's it's again

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.050 
the best circuit and it's it's again
it's<00:01:15.320> just<00:01:15.590> different<00:01:15.770> it's<00:01:16.100> but<00:01:16.880> it's<00:01:16.910> a

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
it's just different it's but it's a

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.330 
it's just different it's but it's a
classic<00:01:17.420> form<00:01:17.600> on<00:01:17.720> circuit<00:01:18.080> so<00:01:18.290> they're<00:01:19.190> both

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
classic form on circuit so they're both

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.890 
classic form on circuit so they're both
great<00:01:19.550> in<00:01:19.880> their<00:01:20.090> own<00:01:20.180> way<00:01:20.300> and<00:01:20.360> quite<00:01:20.750> like

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
great in their own way and quite like

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.690 
great in their own way and quite like
that<00:01:20.930> we<00:01:21.170> switch<00:01:21.530> we've<00:01:21.890> changed<00:01:22.130> from<00:01:22.400> one

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
that we switch we've changed from one

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.010 
that we switch we've changed from one
year<00:01:22.850> together<00:01:23.000> because<00:01:23.509> it<00:01:23.600> makes<00:01:23.750> it<00:01:23.900> quite

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
year together because it makes it quite

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:34.070 
year together because it makes it quite
exciting

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.030 

it's<00:01:35.080> not<00:01:35.200> too<00:01:35.380> difficult<00:01:35.530> you<00:01:35.800> know<00:01:35.890> the

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
it's not too difficult you know the

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.120 
it's not too difficult you know the
layouts<00:01:36.670> the<00:01:36.820> same<00:01:37.060> I<00:01:37.870> don't<00:01:38.350> think<00:01:38.440> there's

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
layouts the same I don't think there's

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.220 
layouts the same I don't think there's
new<00:01:39.280> asphalt<00:01:39.430> so<00:01:40.090> it<00:01:40.300> shouldn't<00:01:40.930> be<00:01:40.960> too

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 
new asphalt so it shouldn't be too

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.670 
new asphalt so it shouldn't be too
tricky<00:01:41.680> to<00:01:41.890> get<00:01:42.010> used<00:01:42.430> to<00:01:43.230> it's<00:01:44.230> a<00:01:44.320> sec<00:01:44.530> I

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
tricky to get used to it's a sec I

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.840 
tricky to get used to it's a sec I
enjoying<00:01:45.040> it's<00:01:45.250> one<00:01:45.340> of<00:01:45.430> the<00:01:45.490> old<00:01:45.670> school

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
enjoying it's one of the old school

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.060 
enjoying it's one of the old school
circus<00:01:46.450> you<00:01:46.600> know<00:01:46.690> it's<00:01:46.810> very<00:01:46.930> narrow<00:01:47.320> very

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
circus you know it's very narrow very

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.830 
circus you know it's very narrow very
flowing<00:01:49.030> and<00:01:50.430> yeah<00:01:51.430> I<00:01:51.460> really<00:01:52.120> enjoy<00:01:52.330> it<00:01:52.420> it's

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
flowing and yeah I really enjoy it it's

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.810 
flowing and yeah I really enjoy it it's
like<00:01:53.260> second<00:01:53.650> nature<00:01:53.680> going<00:01:54.130> to<00:01:54.250> it<00:01:54.370> doesn't

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
like second nature going to it doesn't

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.730 
like second nature going to it doesn't
matter<00:01:54.940> what<00:01:55.030> circuit<00:01:55.360> you<00:01:55.450> go<00:01:55.570> to<00:01:55.650> have<00:01:56.650> an

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
matter what circuit you go to have an

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.130 
matter what circuit you go to have an
experienced<00:01:57.190> it<00:01:57.280> before<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:58.750> know<00:01:58.870> we<00:01:58.990> have

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
experienced it before you know we have

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.900 
experienced it before you know we have
all<00:01:59.260> the<00:01:59.380> data<00:01:59.530> we<00:01:59.770> have<00:02:00.100> footage<00:02:00.340> of<00:02:00.610> the<00:02:00.760> pre

of the past we have all the the setups
that<00:02:04.780> we<00:02:04.960> had<00:02:05.200> in<00:02:05.380> the<00:02:05.470> past<00:02:05.650> we<00:02:06.640> have<00:02:06.790> a

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
that we had in the past we have a

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.639 
that we had in the past we have a
simulator<00:02:07.210> which<00:02:07.540> makes<00:02:08.140> it<00:02:08.290> much<00:02:08.350> much

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
simulator which makes it much much

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.650 
simulator which makes it much much
easier<00:02:08.710> so<00:02:09.250> it<00:02:10.030> doesn't<00:02:10.330> really<00:02:10.450> make<00:02:10.600> any

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
easier so it doesn't really make any

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:21.089 
easier so it doesn't really make any
difference<00:02:10.960> a<00:02:11.170> little

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.380 

it's<00:02:22.099> a<00:02:22.189> very<00:02:22.400> very<00:02:22.430> high<00:02:22.670> speed<00:02:22.909> following

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
it's a very very high speed following

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.630 
it's a very very high speed following
circuit<00:02:23.780> but<00:02:23.900> I<00:02:23.959> would<00:02:24.140> say<00:02:24.319> the<00:02:24.469> first<00:02:24.709> sector

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
circuit but I would say the first sector

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.580 
circuit but I would say the first sector
is<00:02:25.819> probably<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.329> most<00:02:26.480> challenging<00:02:26.989> just

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
is probably the most challenging just

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.599 
is probably the most challenging just
simply<00:02:27.890> because<00:02:28.129> it's<00:02:28.280> you<00:02:28.370> know<00:02:28.400> you're

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:28.609 
simply because it's you know you're

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:30.789 
simply because it's you know you're
breaking<00:02:28.939> down<00:02:29.120> into<00:02:29.480> kamerad<00:02:30.230> corners<00:02:30.620> and

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799 
breaking down into kamerad corners and

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.190 
breaking down into kamerad corners and
there's<00:02:31.159> quite<00:02:31.340> a<00:02:31.370> big<00:02:31.609> undulation<00:02:32.299> from<00:02:32.659> in

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
there's quite a big undulation from in

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.780 
there's quite a big undulation from in
going<00:02:33.560> into<00:02:33.769> turn<00:02:33.890> one<00:02:34.129> an<00:02:34.250> exit<00:02:34.519> of<00:02:34.609> turn<00:02:34.730> one

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
going into turn one an exit of turn one

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.599 
going into turn one an exit of turn one
then<00:02:35.120> you<00:02:35.150> go<00:02:35.269> back<00:02:35.299> uphill<00:02:36.310> and<00:02:37.310> getting<00:02:37.549> the

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:37.609 
then you go back uphill and getting the

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:39.610 
then you go back uphill and getting the
car<00:02:37.760> balanced<00:02:38.120> for<00:02:38.269> those<00:02:38.450> it's<00:02:39.409> quite

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
car balanced for those it's quite

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.440 
car balanced for those it's quite
important<00:02:40.040> it's<00:02:40.370> probably<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:41.239> first

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
important it's probably the first

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.660 
important it's probably the first
complex<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:42.049> new<00:02:42.170> section<00:02:42.590> turn<00:02:43.400> two<00:02:43.640> three

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
complex the new section turn two three

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.479 
complex the new section turn two three
turn<00:02:44.629> to<00:02:44.840> is<00:02:44.989> off<00:02:45.140> camber<00:02:45.620> and<00:02:46.099> negative

turn to is off camber and negative

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.280 
turn to is off camber and negative
camber<00:02:46.760> which<00:02:47.030> caused<00:02:48.019> a<00:02:48.049> lot<00:02:48.260> of

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
camber which caused a lot of

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.869 
camber which caused a lot of
understanding<00:02:48.769> a<00:02:48.799> lot<00:02:49.010> of<00:02:49.129> oversteer<00:02:49.609> and

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
understanding a lot of oversteer and

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:52.569 
understanding a lot of oversteer and
then<00:02:50.329> I<00:02:50.359> takes<00:02:50.629> you<00:02:50.719> down<00:02:50.840> to<00:02:50.900> three<00:02:51.579> where

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
then I takes you down to three where

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:54.220 
then I takes you down to three where
again<00:02:52.819> the<00:02:52.879> tires<00:02:53.209> are<00:02:53.389> very<00:02:53.569> hot<00:02:53.780> and<00:02:53.989> you

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
again the tires are very hot and you

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.979 
again the tires are very hot and you
lose<00:02:54.620> a<00:02:54.680> lot<00:02:54.889> of<00:02:54.980> grip<00:02:55.099> on<00:02:55.220> entry<00:02:55.549> and<00:02:55.870> on<00:02:56.870> the

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
lose a lot of grip on entry and on the

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.300 
lose a lot of grip on entry and on the
exit<00:02:57.290> with<00:02:57.379> oversteer<00:02:57.859> so<00:02:57.980> that's<00:02:58.129> that's

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
exit with oversteer so that's that's

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.369 
exit with oversteer so that's that's
that<00:02:58.519> the<00:02:59.120> trickiest<00:02:59.510> part<00:02:59.810> of<00:02:59.989> it<00:03:00.169> of<00:03:00.260> the

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:00.379 
that the trickiest part of it of the

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:11.720 
that the trickiest part of it of the
circuit

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.420 

the<00:03:12.420> rules<00:03:12.659> keep<00:03:13.080> changing<00:03:13.110> should<00:03:14.040> see<00:03:14.400> a

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
the rules keep changing should see a

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.699 
the rules keep changing should see a
different<00:03:14.819> result<00:03:14.909> in<00:03:15.239> the<00:03:15.330> next<00:03:15.569> race<00:03:15.709> I'm

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
different result in the next race I'm

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.170 
different result in the next race I'm
hopefully<00:03:17.129> more<00:03:17.430> competitive<00:03:17.940> for<00:03:17.970> us

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
hopefully more competitive for us

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.000 
hopefully more competitive for us
because<00:03:18.330> in<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.540> last<00:03:18.720> race<00:03:18.989> they<00:03:19.680> changed

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
because in the last race they changed

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.759 
because in the last race they changed
the<00:03:20.099> rules<00:03:20.310> which<00:03:20.549> hampered<00:03:20.909> us<00:03:21.060> and

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
the rules which hampered us and

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.979 
the rules which hampered us and
benefited<00:03:22.769> some<00:03:22.950> others<00:03:23.220> it<00:03:24.060> kind<00:03:24.390> of<00:03:24.450> doesn't

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
benefited some others it kind of doesn't

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.070 
benefited some others it kind of doesn't
really<00:03:25.230> make<00:03:25.379> it<00:03:25.530> fair<00:03:25.769> racing<00:03:26.129> really<00:03:26.280> but<00:03:26.580> I

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
really make it fair racing really but I

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.300 
really make it fair racing really but I
think<00:03:28.080> this<00:03:28.230> I<00:03:28.530> think<00:03:28.769> now<00:03:29.040> they're

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
think this I think now they're

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.369 
think this I think now they're
introducing<00:03:30.000> those<00:03:30.180> rules<00:03:30.420> changing<00:03:31.319> the

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379 
introducing those rules changing the

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:33.080 
introducing those rules changing the
rules<00:03:31.530> again<00:03:31.620> which<00:03:31.920> hopefully<00:03:32.340> make<00:03:32.790> it<00:03:32.940> more

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
rules again which hopefully make it more

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:44.210 
rules again which hopefully make it more
more<00:03:33.989> level<00:03:34.290> playing<00:03:34.319> field

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.500 

where<00:03:45.220> every<00:03:45.400> every<00:03:45.640> race<00:03:45.790> we're<00:03:46.000> going<00:03:46.239> into

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
where every every race we're going into

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.960 
where every every race we're going into
you<00:03:46.810> know<00:03:46.900> we<00:03:47.049> we<00:03:48.010> hugged<00:03:48.220> the<00:03:48.400> way<00:03:48.549> we're

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
you know we we hugged the way we're

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.490 
you know we we hugged the way we're
competitive<00:03:49.420> enough<00:03:49.599> to<00:03:49.810> really<00:03:50.200> challenge

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
competitive enough to really challenge

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.520 
competitive enough to really challenge
for<00:03:50.829> a<00:03:50.860> win<00:03:51.569> we're<00:03:52.569> not<00:03:52.659> you<00:03:52.959> know<00:03:52.989> this<00:03:53.319> point

for a win we're not you know this point
of<00:03:53.590> the<00:03:53.620> season<00:03:53.680> thinking<00:03:54.189> about<00:03:54.370> the

of the season thinking about the

of the season thinking about the
championship<00:03:54.819> it's<00:03:55.540> more<00:03:55.750> important<00:03:56.170> to<00:03:56.200> take

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:56.349 
championship it's more important to take

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:59.580 
championship it's more important to take
every<00:03:56.590> race<00:03:56.769> and<00:03:56.799> it<00:03:57.040> comes<00:03:58.140> where<00:03:59.140> we're

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
every race and it comes where we're

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:00.630 
every race and it comes where we're
looking<00:03:59.799> forward<00:03:59.980> to<00:04:00.069> getting<00:04:00.159> back<00:04:00.340> out

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
looking forward to getting back out

there and releasing where we are and
I've<00:04:04.180> speaking<00:04:05.049> to<00:04:05.109> the<00:04:05.200> engineers<00:04:05.590> today<00:04:06.040> and

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
I've speaking to the engineers today and

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.770 
I've speaking to the engineers today and
just<00:04:06.370> saying<00:04:06.609> that<00:04:06.760> the<00:04:06.879> racing<00:04:07.239> so<00:04:07.420> much<00:04:07.569> fun

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
just saying that the racing so much fun

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.300 
just saying that the racing so much fun
you<00:04:07.900> know<00:04:08.019> it's<00:04:08.140> really<00:04:08.349> fun<00:04:08.769> to<00:04:08.799> be<00:04:09.010> a<00:04:09.040> part<00:04:09.189> of

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
you know it's really fun to be a part of

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.149 
you know it's really fun to be a part of
it<00:04:09.459> and<00:04:10.230> racing<00:04:11.230> it<00:04:11.349> Ferrari<00:04:11.739> and<00:04:11.920> Red<00:04:12.129> Bull

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:12.159
