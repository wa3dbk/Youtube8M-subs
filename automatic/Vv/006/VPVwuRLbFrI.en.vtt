00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
so we here at the rich techie which is a

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.559 
so we here at the rich techie which is a
PCB<00:00:03.810> design<00:00:04.259> house<00:00:04.529> and<00:00:04.950> we<00:00:05.910> hear<00:00:06.150> they<00:00:06.270> do<00:00:06.390> all

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
PCB design house and we hear they do all

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.990 
PCB design house and we hear they do all
kinds<00:00:06.960> of<00:00:07.080> testing<00:00:07.859> on<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.220> freescale

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
kinds of testing on the freescale

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.169 
kinds of testing on the freescale
powered<00:00:11.900> TCB<00:00:12.929> so<00:00:13.650> you<00:00:13.710> have<00:00:13.950> some<00:00:14.190> design<00:00:14.849> what

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
powered TCB so you have some design what

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.640 
powered TCB so you have some design what
what<00:00:15.450> is<00:00:15.570> this<00:00:15.750> what<00:00:16.080> are<00:00:16.109> you<00:00:16.230> doing<00:00:16.440> here

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
free scalar which one it's 51 51 and you

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.760 
free scalar which one it's 51 51 and you
do<00:00:40.649> testing<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.340> put<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:41.610> there<00:00:45.590> the<00:00:46.590> main

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
do testing and you put it there the main

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.850 
do testing and you put it there the main

you know so here at rich techie you make

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.200 
you know so here at rich techie you make
a<00:01:51.780> freescale<00:01:52.590> part<00:01:52.829> more<00:01:53.189> this<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.549> 53<00:01:54.180> I

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
a freescale part more this is a 53 I

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.460 
a freescale part more this is a 53 I
make<00:01:54.479> 53<00:01:55.049> yeah<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:56.360> PCB<00:01:57.360> for<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.630> future<00:01:57.960> yes

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
make 53 yeah the PCB for the future yes

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.080 
make 53 yeah the PCB for the future yes
it's<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.250> future<00:02:00.590> reference

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
it's the future reference

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.080 
it's the future reference
53<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.679> it's<00:02:04.679> going<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.009> be<00:02:05.280> in<00:02:05.399> part<00:02:05.610> awesome

that's one months yeah so what do you do
there<00:02:16.019> you<00:02:16.050> have<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.530> DS<00:02:17.340> you<00:02:17.519> connect<00:02:17.910> you

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
there you have the DS you connect you

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.000 
there you have the DS you connect you
have<00:02:19.400> measuring<00:02:20.400> some<00:02:21.200> resistance<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:22.530> we

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
have measuring some resistance and we

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:30.229 
have measuring some resistance and we
try<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.250> fix<00:02:23.640> a<00:02:23.910> bug<00:02:24.600> in<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.900> PCB<00:02:25.260> or<00:02:29.239> touch

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239

try to fix a bug in the PCB or touch
panel<00:02:30.569> on<00:02:30.690> testing<00:02:34.370> may<00:02:35.370> I<00:02:35.400> ask<00:02:35.610> what<00:02:36.090> is<00:02:36.239> over

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
panel on testing may I ask what is over

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.729 
panel on testing may I ask what is over
there<00:02:36.660> in<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.840> office<00:02:36.959> what<00:02:37.319> are<00:02:37.350> all<00:02:37.590> the

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
there in the office what are all the

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.080 
there in the office what are all the
other<00:02:37.890> ones<00:02:38.130> what<00:02:38.549> is<00:02:38.700> over<00:02:38.850> there

other ones what is over there
what<00:02:39.480> is<00:02:39.600> that<00:02:40.519> can<00:02:41.519> we<00:02:41.930> can<00:02:42.930> you<00:02:42.989> take<00:02:43.170> it<00:02:43.290> out

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
what is that can we can you take it out

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:50.229 
what is that can we can you take it out
there's<00:02:45.090> some<00:02:45.269> previous<00:02:46.019> products<00:02:46.470> or<00:02:46.620> if

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:58.610 

that's<00:02:51.890> 5150<00:02:54.380> all<00:02:55.380> right<00:02:55.970> so<00:02:57.560> how<00:02:58.560> many

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
that's 5150 all right so how many

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.920 
that's 5150 all right so how many
customers<00:02:59.070> do<00:02:59.430> you<00:02:59.519> have<00:02:59.670> how<00:03:00.480> many<00:03:00.540> do<00:03:00.810> you

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
customers do you have how many do you

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:13.840 
customers do you have how many do you
make<00:03:01.130> how<00:03:02.130> many<00:03:02.190> people<00:03:02.730> use<00:03:02.970> your<00:03:03.180> design

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.860 

secret<00:03:14.240> what<00:03:15.400> is<00:03:16.400> that<00:03:16.910> is<00:03:17.060> it<00:03:17.090> millions<00:03:17.720> of

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
secret what is that is it millions of

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.860 
secret what is that is it millions of
products<00:03:18.260> every<00:03:18.500> year<00:03:18.530> or<00:03:18.950> not<00:03:19.780> one<00:03:20.780> hundred

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
products every year or not one hundred

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:28.540 
products every year or not one hundred
thousands<00:03:25.570> fifteen<00:03:26.570> fifteen<00:03:27.320> thousand<00:03:27.710> all

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
thousands fifteen fifteen thousand all

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.280 
thousands fifteen fifteen thousand all
right<00:03:28.760> so<00:03:28.970> the<00:03:29.240> app<00:03:29.390> and<00:03:29.630> use<00:03:30.020> that<00:03:32.110> you<00:03:33.110> use

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
right so the app and use that you use

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.410 
right so the app and use that you use
that<00:03:33.500> for<00:03:33.770> our<00:03:33.800> partner<00:03:34.430> your<00:03:34.820> partner<00:03:34.850> and
