00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 hello to all today we are you 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.130
 found to present you a review 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.160
 actually on the cosmetics brand and 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.320
 especially the nectar of nature range so 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.670
 in fact it is a brand that is sold 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.410
 in all carrefour stores 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.690
 I think most stores in 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.400
 France yes and in fact where he proposes 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.350
 really a wide choice of products you 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.539
 were able to ski care for the body you 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.470
 have makeup remover shampoo 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.900
 Shower gels 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.400
 finally really really see a wide 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.750
 choice and so I sew there are some 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.060
 a few weeks late I had already 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.590
 heard about this brand sure about 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.969
 youtube and so on and there are some 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.530
 weeks I wanted to test because 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.149
 because here I wanted to have an opinion 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.540
 and projects make me want 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.710
 So suddenly it's done 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.940
 did it yeah it's been a few weeks 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.530
 but obviously I will make you a 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.629
 review if I have not tested the products 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.950
 money sees no interest if not so 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.360
 here I present you what I took 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.920
 and then and then give you my opinion on 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.789
 the projects so first of all I have 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.280
 learned a little cyclical like that so he 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.899
 consists of a scrub of a butter 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.039
 body and a small balm for 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.329
 lips so in fact he was presenting himself 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.949
 in the box I kept the box for 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.409
 that you can recognize is in 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.540
 a cave like this one you see a 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.590
 hectare of nature and so I had 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.890
 took the bang scent 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.570
 it seems to me that he had also taken 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.400
 ruin or wise and cooler you flare 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.610
 plus it was something like that so 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.409
 I leave my cost 9 euros is really 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.630
 the three products that I have in it 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.040
 am a fan so first of all the scrub 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.540
 so it's a scrub for the body at 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.130
 mango butter actually 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.619
 so you see that I have already 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.939
 not bad used and I'm crazy 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.540
 really it's a project of 200 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.280
 milliliters 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.110
 it seems to the unit if you buy it 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.439
 out of the kit it has to cost about 5 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.840
 euros 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.220
 and here it is top I will show you 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.369
 in fact and thanks that I like a lot 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.439
 is that the grains are very big you 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.600
 have really there are some grains 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.430
 brown and yellow is really this album 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.780
 very well there why do you really 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.220
 a scrub that is effective and not 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.409
 something wrong with two not really 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.329
 helpful what the time is divine 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.100
 and that's it since I've been using 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.420
 I have much less, if not more 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.460
 all hair ingrown on the legs 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.840
 the legs are much softer even 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.700
 without putting the body butter I would have 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.290
 already the difference so really it's 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.540
 a scrub that is really very very 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.520
 well good this one I advise you 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.270
 and frankly his share not too much 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.970
 so fast again 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.310
 so here's the scrub then I tested 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.980
 the bodily good so they say 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.870
 silky nutrients for dry skin 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.010
 so that's still a profit of 100 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.090
 milliliters showers fall a bit to 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.800
 every body bar that has 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.840
 now and in fact I was surprised 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.610
 on taken by the texture I do not know if 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.379
 you see it's finally font to a little 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.090
 I went too strange it's a bit 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.560
 flabby like that you see that so I 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.989
 do not go in so in fact 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.739
 between I would say the creamy texture and the 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:43.379
 body butter texture actually I know 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.730
 not if you see but we will not see anymore 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.129
 butter that I think is great 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.959
 strange and but really it is great 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.640
 effective I applied it every night 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.629
 for two weeks to see little 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.760
 really close to its utility and its 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:59.040
 efficiency especially is really it 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.810
 works super well done he does not leave 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.030
 a greasy film on the skin it penetrates diÃ© 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.010
 immediately tell you can you 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.890
 had just after there's no worries and 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.060
 this is the dr and he loves what the sleeve 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.909
 it's really a but favorite fruit in 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.349
 more so really I really like 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:14.310
 the hydra was very good so here I am 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.110
 think it's a product that I 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.180
 will redeem because because he is 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.610
 really great then in this kit there 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.290
 also had a little balm for them 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.519
 lips in fact so always on the same 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.930
 case not jean actually it's a little 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.909
 like the body butter but in 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.409
 miniature 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:31.260
 so it came up like these and 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:32.700
 it's 1.1 point for the lips is in 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.349
 I was also surprised too 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.340
 because it's like a glass if you 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:37.650
 put it on the lips 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.450
 so for men savate super alif 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.709
 a good one you like the ice facts and 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.360
 you see it's really hyper u 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.709
 shining so me what am I doing 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.140
 is that Africa in general at night 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.069
 it's really us evening boom see 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.870
 he really gives one of the sons 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:51.209
 glittery shiny end what all 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.739
 just like a gloss and perfume 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.090
 but when you eat because 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.580
 necessarily the gloss after his voice in 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.959
 your mouth when you eat but 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.540
 it's extra you really have a little 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.590
 fruity and sweet taste so I love 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.670
 I put it in a thick layer 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.310
 evening and I find that he feeds 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.360
 extremely well and washes the bath 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.900
 I wake up I really have the student 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.280
 very soft repair and so that's the 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.900
 only that sometimes I would say to be lacking 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.700
 if you do not really like the facts 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.140
 feel in May and that's otherwise it's 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.790
 really a very very good product and 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.650
 for that they do a lot of price of 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.840
 bought individually it has to cost 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.720
 3 euros individually there really 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.610
 full full of full of shock odors 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.260
 with red fruit coke not really the 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.590
 you can really find your 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.950
 happiness 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.630
 so after this kit I wanted to test a 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.310
 shampoo and a conditioner because 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.139
 that I wanted to change 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.570
 final i will stick to my routine 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:40.190
 capillary because I really do not like 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.270
 at all his shampoos so I had 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.680
 first took the shampoo 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.889
 normalizing so it's up to orange at 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.479
 rosemary for for for anything 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:48.950
 for normal hair that tends to 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:51.470
 regret it's so it's like 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:54.430
 this then see that I still have well 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:56.690
 come down so the danger lies nice 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.610
 it's a pungent smell the same joking 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.840
 I would say is the signature and all of us 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.630
 really have to say there's nothing to say 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.889
 but then I was already there as woman 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.750
 is everything that surprised me was his play 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:07.639
 products but this thing is too weird 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.470
 because it's not texture shampoo that 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:10.910
 made like a gel you see the jane 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.350
 for men but it does not stick 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.940
 obviously but the texture is this 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.010
 what's so weird it's really 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.030
 thick and I find it weird that 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.860
 shampoo on the other hand they will all 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.380
 extremely well I've never seen so much 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.610
 foam with a shampoo so that's it 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.510
 this is a positive 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.800
 after I say not that it's a bad 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.960
 shampoo the monks not fit because 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.190
 that he just has your hair so if you 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.410
 want a cheap shampoo because it 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.610
 I think they're listening to 1.80 each 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.840
 cheap times just to wash you I 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.770
 do not make movies we did not have any 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.510
 particular problem 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.010
 I advise you in this case and me 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.389
 here he does not say he is not well 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:41.690
 but it's not a shampoo that is 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:43.490
 suited for my hair so here I am 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.930
 will throw away the finish because 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.990
 here I do not like to throw products but 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:49.280
 uh that's not like I was not 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.510
 necessarily packed by this range 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.919
 then I learned the song after 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.830
 shampoo that went with so always 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:55.729
 with orange and rosemary 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.860
 so it looks like this one 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:59.750
 was costing 1,80 and this one by 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.100
 redness does nothing at all I find it 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.039
 not soften the hair and dirty 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.690
 mails absolutely no it does not feed 

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:09.410
 hungry and I find that stuff no matter what 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:10.490
 so that's it's not after they have not 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.300
 bad shampoo maybe I 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.610
 will test in others 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.440
 other ranges because there was to 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.930
 colored hair blond hair 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.150
 brown you had for oily hair 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.889
 the dry hair they have I tell you to 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.289
 the wide range street paris for young people 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:25.400
 move it's really a lot of things 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:27.560
 which I find at the same that it has me a 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.330
 little bit disappointed and finally from a book seen 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.490
 that I had taken is a pout center 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:34.129
 for intense purity and green tea 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:36.139
 and lemon balm so I wanted it 

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:38.360
 present in my face care routine 

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:40.759
 and I'm really conquered it's a 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.840
 product that I love so these scents of 

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:43.550
 garden again it's an odor 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.199
 a little nature etc for mixed skin to 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.340
 fat 

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:48.319

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.729

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:53.840

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.919
