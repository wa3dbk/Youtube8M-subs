00:00:00.239 --> 00:00:06.220

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:10.360
 review today will talk about cosmetics for 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:13.049
 eye of the face and actually show jewelry 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:16.870
 1 want to start this such two carcasses 1 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:19.300
 lengthening another for volume changing 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:21.190
 tourism sound regretted and would not fit 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.290
 really make eyelashes very 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:26.680
 long but she absolutely not 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:29.830
 I do not share eyelashes 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.110
 few are not thick enough and she 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.120
 echoes don't just stick together and find 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.530
 such effect of wet eyelashes is created 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.870
 so for such 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:41.320
 the owner of those of us like mine 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:44.530
 I do not advise but if you have thick eyelashes then 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.910
 please because with its function on 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.300
 handle on really them 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.130
 lengthens so look up 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.950
 maybe you will like the second mascara 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.950
 which came to me this mascara for volume 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.840
 she and divide on them lengthens and 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.360
 really makes bulk i love 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.310
 such eyelashes because from afar you 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.740
 will be very beautiful great you can see that 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.690
 eyes are made up actually in this i see 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.479
 the function is the same she should do eyes 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.570
 more she opens up my mind so 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.830
 yes this one is very cool and the next one 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.530
 I'd like to tell 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.810
 her eyeliner is very thin 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.670
 comfortable ganin sleep applicator that when i 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.950
 I get to the middle of my eyes 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.770
 re- dunk 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.110
 the applicator is a dead end because she 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.180
 dries out and no longer draw in this 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.100
 of course plus buy markers 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.650
 sub next product for eyes and 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.750
 whom I'd like to tell you 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:41.799
 palette of shadows from the fashion color collection 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:45.020
 4 colors are presented here two shades 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:48.020
 pink 1 white and dark in the middle 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.240
 tony shadow of this for in fact things 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.700
 very cool that everything in the same palette is not 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.159
 need to buy a separate base here everything 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.740
 there is only a pity that this is not 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:00.319
 works that is from the base that without a shadow 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.920
 absolutely not holding them not very 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:06.799
 persistent remind me of the essence of quattro 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.799
 as you remember there are 4 colors 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:12.170
 too but they seem to be left alone 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:14.840
 products for the face and start perhaps with 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.790
 tuscan matting powder package 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.680
 acquires and girlfriend them certainly 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.459
 win she really 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.079
 evens skin tone it does not dry the skin 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:28.400
 here also present and sparkle and 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:31.730
 I'll even show you a sponge 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.299
 ring here it is sponge I have here 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.209
 still 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:37.790
 Milan, I do not take off as this 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.450
 powder I do not use because there is still 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.910
 the old 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.970
 but then I thought with pleasure next 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.910
 the product is a Persian makeup base 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.730
 a professor changes yogurt for a minute 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.010
 she does not smell but the colors of such 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.470
 strawberry yogurt don't know and chewing gum 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.230
 something it prevents shedding 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.030
 darkness and makes them more resistant and yes it 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.190
 concerns not only those since i 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.760
 She said that this base under makeup 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:07.730
 it is both ruddy and bronzer and all that you 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.100
 put on your face it seems that 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.590
 small jar on really you 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.650
 enough of this base for a long time since she 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.299
 very easy to spread on face 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.130
 very delicate in its texture and me 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:21.620
 really like the next product 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:25.069
 which to me is a bit of a disappointment, 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.480
 matting tone base here 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:30.930
 there is aloe vera extract and 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.090
 moisturizes the skin evens out the skin tone that 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.459
 and copes with all its functions 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.780
 but where is the ram that got caught 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:42.810
 a tube and that is, I immediately got you 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.640
 I open it and I have such a surprise 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.920
 very upset he follows me 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.989
 constantly at the same time I'm on him completely 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.590
 I do not press the last cosmetic product 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:54.870
 it is such a rector days and bactericidal 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.970
 I know that they usually still miss 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.400
 masking pencil and got me 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.260
 so and really very happy because 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.629
 what besides personal items 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.090
 and it is also enriched with oil 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:08.549
 tea tree out of coincidence or not 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:12.329
 but just yesterday we downloaded a huge 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:15.299
 pimple I thought here it is a chance 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:18.180
 you can try real people worth 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:20.400
 inspection my keys almost disappeared I donâ€™t know 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.049
 at the expense of what really helped 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.270
 proofreader but in any case I advise 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.520
 buy because even if she has 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.800
 here it is perfectly masks cosmetics 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.300
 similar to and now as promised I will tell 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.620
 little about jewelry 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:36.030
 I got these funny ones 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.220
 relatives bows 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.470
 I will tell about each now in more detail about 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.750
 starting with the little ring and you happened to him 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.789
 very nice story when 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:48.240
 I returned home, I still wanted 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:50.490
 see touch the department ring she 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.860
 I was great, I thought that he could 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.320
 somehow clamp the bottom in size and 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.099
 since it is plastic but mine 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.669
 broke down 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:05:01.830
 This is how it looks on me now and not 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:03.870
 I know how much you can see but also necessarily 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.030
 its glue will wear next year 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.700
 these are the ring earrings here 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:11.340
 also present batik they also 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:13.440
 plastic and yes they are very massive 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.260
 despite its size is very light 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:19.470
 the last thing I want to show you is 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:22.080
 the bracelet here is also a bow unfortunately not 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.340
 too big too wide like that 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.979
 clear small ring 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.410
 then the villa is all for that thank you 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:30.990

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.400
 found something useful and if u 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.180
