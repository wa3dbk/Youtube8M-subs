route-finding<00:00:43.649> now<00:00:44.309> this<00:00:44.550> one<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:44.789> thought<00:00:45.059> was

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
route-finding now this one I thought was

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.479 
route-finding now this one I thought was
a<00:00:45.329> major<00:00:45.809> problem<00:00:46.530> with<00:00:46.739> Oh<00:00:46.770> Simon<00:00:47.070> scape

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
a major problem with Oh Simon scape

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.209 
a major problem with Oh Simon scape
sometimes<00:00:48.270> when<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.660> run<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:49.559> go<00:00:49.770> back<00:00:49.980> to

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
sometimes when you run you go back to

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.860 
sometimes when you run you go back to
squares<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.969> then<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.270> start<00:00:51.600> running

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
squares and then you start running

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.799 
squares and then you start running
forward<00:00:52.469> again<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.850> thought<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.239> was<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.449> big

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
forward again and I thought it was a big

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.490 
forward again and I thought it was a big
waste<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.379> run<00:00:55.710> energy<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:57.260> thought<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.410> was

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
waste of run energy and I thought it was

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.590 
waste of run energy and I thought it was
it<00:00:58.770> just<00:00:58.980> needed<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.520> be<00:00:59.670> fixed<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.329> think

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
it just needed to be fixed and I think

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.779 
it just needed to be fixed and I think
it<00:01:00.690> also<00:01:00.870> includes<00:01:01.410> with<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.829> when<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:02.579> dance

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
it also includes with the when you dance

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.729 
it also includes with the when you dance
with<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.120> monsters<00:01:03.840> oh<00:01:04.140> yeah<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.470> actually

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
with the monsters oh yeah it actually

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.310 
with the monsters oh yeah it actually
does<00:01:04.970> dancing<00:01:05.970> around<00:01:06.270> big<00:01:06.479> monsters<00:01:07.020> when

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
does dancing around big monsters when

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.770 
does dancing around big monsters when
you<00:01:07.409> actually<00:01:07.560> run<00:01:08.369> into<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.790> monster<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.540> you

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
you actually run into a monster and you

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.660 
you actually run into a monster and you
start<00:01:10.020> dancing<00:01:10.530> like<00:01:10.799> nobody's<00:01:11.520> attacking

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
start dancing like nobody's attacking

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.940 
start dancing like nobody's attacking
each<00:01:12.150> other<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:13.200> start<00:01:13.439> dancing<00:01:13.619> around

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
each other and you start dancing around

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.219 
each other and you start dancing around
so<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.490> should<00:01:15.030> definitely<00:01:15.630> be<00:01:15.840> fixed

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
so this should definitely be fixed

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.780 
so this should definitely be fixed
because<00:01:16.320> it's<00:01:16.560> annoying<00:01:17.130> as<00:01:17.369> hell<00:01:17.580> in<00:01:17.759> my

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
because it's annoying as hell in my

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.719 
because it's annoying as hell in my
opinion<00:01:18.360> but<00:01:19.229> we<00:01:19.380> will<00:01:19.560> see<00:01:19.740> about<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:20.130> then

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
opinion but we will see about that then

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.030 
opinion but we will see about that then
we<00:01:20.909> have<00:01:21.030> themed<00:01:21.659> world<00:01:22.170> list<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.680> don't<00:01:22.710> really

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
we have themed world list I don't really

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.480

I think it is our minigame I don't know

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.720 
I think it is our minigame I don't know
what<00:02:33.370> that<00:02:33.519> is

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
what that is

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.720 
what that is
path<00:02:34.390> of<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:34.989> something<00:02:35.709> also<00:02:36.310> I<00:02:36.340> think<00:02:36.430> it's

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
path of the something also I think it's

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.380 
path of the something also I think it's
a<00:02:36.849> quest<00:02:37.180> and<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:38.080> zmi<00:02:38.950> altar<00:02:39.579> which<00:02:40.000> I<00:02:40.209> don't

think it would be too good I don't know

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.839 
think it would be too good I don't know
I<00:02:42.519> don't<00:02:42.640> like<00:02:42.940> the<00:02:43.150> CMI<00:02:44.220> right<00:02:45.220> so<00:02:45.430> about<00:02:45.670> the

reason why people don't want the god was

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.789 
reason why people don't want the god was

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
is because the age yes that's the only

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.890 
is because the age yes that's the only
reason<00:03:03.129> most<00:03:03.310> of<00:03:03.489> the<00:03:03.640> questions<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.390> answers

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
reason most of the questions the answers

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.259 
reason most of the questions the answers
where<00:03:05.260> it's<00:03:05.530> because<00:03:05.950> of<00:03:06.099> the<00:03:06.190> age<00:03:06.340> yes<00:03:06.670> we

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
where it's because of the age yes we

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:08.849 
where it's because of the age yes we
don't<00:03:07.420> want<00:03:07.629> that<00:03:07.750> over<00:03:08.109> the<00:03:08.170> power<00:03:08.349> to<00:03:08.560> weapon

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
don't want that over the power to weapon

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:10.949 
don't want that over the power to weapon
in<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.129> game<00:03:09.310> and<00:03:09.819> in<00:03:09.940> my<00:03:10.090> opinion<00:03:10.180> yeah

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
in the game and in my opinion yeah

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.650 
in the game and in my opinion yeah
that's<00:03:11.200> kind<00:03:11.470> of<00:03:11.560> right<00:03:11.799> because<00:03:12.329> we<00:03:13.329> have<00:03:13.510> the

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
that's kind of right because we have the

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.750 
that's kind of right because we have the
saradomin<00:03:14.260> god<00:03:14.620> sword<00:03:14.859> it's<00:03:15.099> not<00:03:15.250> a<00:03:15.280> powerful

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
saradomin god sword it's not a powerful

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.479 
saradomin god sword it's not a powerful
and<00:03:16.060> PvP<00:03:16.510> sure<00:03:17.140> in<00:03:17.349> ppm<00:03:17.620> it<00:03:17.859> may<00:03:18.010> be<00:03:18.069> powerful

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
and PvP sure in ppm it may be powerful

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.759 
and PvP sure in ppm it may be powerful
but<00:03:18.700> in<00:03:19.030> PvP<00:03:19.450> it's<00:03:19.569> not<00:03:19.780> that<00:03:19.930> powerful<00:03:20.139> so

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
but in PvP it's not that powerful so

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.920 
but in PvP it's not that powerful so
it's<00:03:20.919> all<00:03:21.069> fine<00:03:21.340> then<00:03:22.030> we<00:03:22.180> have<00:03:22.359> the<00:03:22.540> samurai

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
it's all fine then we have the samurai

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.220 
it's all fine then we have the samurai
gods<00:03:23.230> what<00:03:23.470> also<00:03:23.769> not<00:03:24.459> that<00:03:24.669> good<00:03:25.209> it's<00:03:25.720> decent

but not that good

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.460 
but not that good
and<00:03:27.190> then<00:03:28.150> we<00:03:28.299> have<00:03:28.450> the<00:03:28.569> Bandos<00:03:28.930> god<00:03:29.169> sword

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.250 
it's good but you know not as good as
HGS<00:03:32.590> and<00:03:32.889> then<00:03:33.040> we<00:03:33.220> have<00:03:33.430> the<00:03:33.989> overpowered<00:03:34.989> age

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
HGS and then we have the overpowered age

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.830 
HGS and then we have the overpowered age
yes<00:03:35.799> yes<00:03:36.400> in<00:03:36.549> my<00:03:36.669> opinion<00:03:37.030> is<00:03:37.209> a<00:03:37.239> little<00:03:37.660> bit

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
yes yes in my opinion is a little bit

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.809 
yes yes in my opinion is a little bit
overpowered<00:03:38.470> because<00:03:38.859> you<00:03:39.010> can<00:03:39.130> spec<00:03:39.489> twice

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
overpowered because you can spec twice

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.420 
overpowered because you can spec twice
if<00:03:40.630> you<00:03:40.870> could<00:03:41.049> spec<00:03:41.349> only<00:03:41.650> once<00:03:41.919> I<00:03:42.099> guess<00:03:42.280> it

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
if you could spec only once I guess it

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.690 
if you could spec only once I guess it
would<00:03:42.639> be<00:03:42.790> fine<00:03:43.060> but<00:03:43.650> that's<00:03:44.650> I<00:03:44.980> think<00:03:45.430> that's

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
would be fine but that's I think that's

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.400 
would be fine but that's I think that's
the<00:03:45.970> only<00:03:46.000> reason<00:03:46.269> why<00:03:46.660> people<00:03:46.690> don't<00:03:47.200> want

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
the only reason why people don't want

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.140 
the only reason why people don't want
the<00:03:47.500> god<00:03:47.680> was<00:03:47.889> it's<00:03:48.190> not<00:03:48.370> the<00:03:48.489> armor

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
the god was it's not the armor

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.190 
the god was it's not the armor
it's<00:03:49.599> the<00:03:49.810> age<00:03:49.989> yes<00:03:50.319> so<00:03:50.709> if<00:03:51.010> they<00:03:51.370> would<00:03:51.549> add<00:03:51.730> it

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
it's the age yes so if they would add it

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.599 
it's the age yes so if they would add it
I'm<00:03:53.200> not<00:03:53.380> sure<00:03:53.440> I'm<00:03:53.950> not<00:03:54.010> sure<00:03:54.160> they're<00:03:54.489> gonna

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:54.609 
I'm not sure I'm not sure they're gonna

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:57.360 
I'm not sure I'm not sure they're gonna
make<00:03:54.730> the<00:03:55.030> pole<00:03:55.239> and<00:03:55.569> in<00:03:56.139> my<00:03:56.290> opinion<00:03:56.410> if<00:03:56.980> any

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
make the pole and in my opinion if any

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.059 
make the pole and in my opinion if any
pole<00:03:57.730> actually<00:03:58.450> passes<00:03:59.079> through<00:03:59.440> which<00:03:59.829> means

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
pole actually passes through which means

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.199 
pole actually passes through which means
that<00:04:00.340> it<00:04:00.549> gets<00:04:00.959> 75%<00:04:01.959> as<00:04:02.310> yes<00:04:03.310> you<00:04:03.790> know<00:04:03.910> people

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
that it gets 75% as yes you know people

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.300 
that it gets 75% as yes you know people
want<00:04:04.389> that<00:04:04.629> in<00:04:05.079> my<00:04:05.169> opinion<00:04:05.739> it's<00:04:05.980> fine

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
want that in my opinion it's fine

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.039 
want that in my opinion it's fine
because<00:04:06.489> majority<00:04:06.790> of<00:04:07.150> the<00:04:07.299> people<00:04:07.480> want<00:04:07.870> it

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
because majority of the people want it

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.129 
because majority of the people want it
and<00:04:08.230> even<00:04:08.590> if<00:04:08.709> I<00:04:08.859> don't<00:04:08.919> I<00:04:09.449> should<00:04:10.449> respect<00:04:10.870> the

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:11.139 
and even if I don't I should respect the

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:14.039 
and even if I don't I should respect the
others<00:04:11.769> opinion<00:04:12.340> and<00:04:12.579> what<00:04:13.329> they<00:04:13.449> also<00:04:13.599> said

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
others opinion and what they also said

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:16.710 
others opinion and what they also said
is<00:04:14.319> that<00:04:14.349> we<00:04:15.129> could<00:04:15.310> also<00:04:15.519> create<00:04:15.879> new<00:04:16.060> content

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
is that we could also create new content

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.229 
is that we could also create new content
for<00:04:16.870> you<00:04:17.049> if<00:04:17.169> you<00:04:17.320> liked<00:04:17.620> such<00:04:18.400> as<00:04:18.699> new

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
for you if you liked such as new

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:20.789 
for you if you liked such as new
Treasure<00:04:19.570> Trail<00:04:19.690> clues

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
Treasure Trail clues

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.940 
Treasure Trail clues
so<00:04:21.010> that<00:04:21.220> means<00:04:21.430> elite<00:04:22.060> I<00:04:22.360> think<00:04:23.140> new

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
so that means elite I think new

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.310 
so that means elite I think new
recolored<00:04:24.490> version<00:04:25.030> of<00:04:25.180> certain<00:04:25.630> items<00:04:25.810> and

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
recolored version of certain items and

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.110 
recolored version of certain items and
maybe

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
maybe

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.909 
maybe
even<00:04:27.449> a<00:04:27.540> mini<00:04:27.720> quest<00:04:27.990> because<00:04:28.350> they<00:04:28.830> are

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
even a mini quest because they are

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:30.920 
even a mini quest because they are
currently<00:04:29.340> very<00:04:29.580> limited<00:04:30.210> to<00:04:30.600> what<00:04:30.750> they<00:04:30.900> can

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
currently very limited to what they can

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.500 
currently very limited to what they can
change<00:04:31.410> in<00:04:31.620> the<00:04:31.710> game<00:04:31.889> so<00:04:32.220> it's<00:04:32.250> only<00:04:32.970> little

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
change in the game so it's only little

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.060 
change in the game so it's only little
things<00:04:33.810> that<00:04:34.020> they<00:04:34.139> can<00:04:34.320> do<00:04:34.470> at<00:04:34.590> the<00:04:34.710> moment

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
things that they can do at the moment

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.980 
things that they can do at the moment
but<00:04:35.639> in<00:04:35.820> the<00:04:35.910> future<00:04:36.150> I'm<00:04:36.419> sure<00:04:36.449> that's<00:04:36.870> gonna

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
but in the future I'm sure that's gonna

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.460 
but in the future I'm sure that's gonna
be<00:04:37.080> you<00:04:37.889> know<00:04:38.040> it's<00:04:38.970> gonna<00:04:39.120> be<00:04:39.300> better<00:04:39.479> so<00:04:40.440> I

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
be you know it's gonna be better so I

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.990 
be you know it's gonna be better so I
think<00:04:40.650> that's<00:04:40.949> all<00:04:41.100> I<00:04:41.130> wanted<00:04:41.460> to<00:04:41.520> say<00:04:41.790> in<00:04:41.880> this

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
think that's all I wanted to say in this

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.790 
think that's all I wanted to say in this
video<00:04:42.360> I<00:04:42.419> just<00:04:42.750> wanted<00:04:43.050> to<00:04:43.169> inform<00:04:43.500> you<00:04:43.650> that

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
they could be updating the game if

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.730 
they could be updating the game if
majority<00:04:47.220> of<00:04:47.430> us<00:04:47.729> say<00:04:48.389> yes<00:04:48.720> okay<00:04:49.380> so<00:04:49.440> I'll<00:04:49.710> be
