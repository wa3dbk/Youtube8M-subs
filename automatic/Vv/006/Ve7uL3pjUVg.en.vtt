00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.489
 flames 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.010
 the first big explosion would have had 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.440
 a radius of 4 km causing the fire 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.930
 of some hectares of surrounding land

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.649
 fire that was with the truck 20 meters

 now it is not life threatening 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.400
 also the alessio victim of giacomo 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.040
 son of the factory owner is 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.110
 been involved in the second explosion

 despite having told him not to 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.729
 passing there was caught in full 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.439
 from the second explosion in the area 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.360
 the accident caused pain but that 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.710
 wonder why giacomo's family is 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.659
 known as one of the most 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.210
 established professionals in the field of 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.310
 fireworks in the building of the 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.590

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.740
 said he was saved because he was thrown 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.439
 yes immediately of the bunker of 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.939
 then save two components 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.460

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.439

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.780

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.280
 side and then there was adriano than today 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.409
 instead of standing next to the brothers 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.090
 mauro and federico had gone downtown a 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.549
 sant'angelo city for a medical examination 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.560
 we had no workers said between the 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.900
 hiccups was a family business there 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.790
 my 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.310
 and abruzzo adriano fails to 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.230
 understanding why he says was the best 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.150
 We had a regional laboratory 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.910
 all over again it was all new 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.880
 beautiful roofs all insulated walls from 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.160
 40 centimeters Mauro said again 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.720
 the surviving brother was standing 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.730
 preparing for what had to go to 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.770
 he was working on the bombs already 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.630
 closed but ours was an environment 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.070
 fresh and cutting edge I really don't know 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.410
 give me an explanation 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.240
 to extinguish the blazing fire on 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.920
 the canadian hills intervened 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.600
 the Pescara Public Prosecutor's Office opened a 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.430
 file with the hypothesis of crime of 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.740
 culpable disaster and multiple murder 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.540
 culpable against unknown persons 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.730
 the rescuers and the police 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.620
 they stopped searching in the afternoon 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.660
 there is a strong danger of new ones 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.400
 explosions due to the presence of dust 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.920
 black and unexploded fireworks 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.350
 huge area of ​​crater cultivated fields 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.940
 woods olive groves hills and cliffs e 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.520
 forbidden and must be reclaimed 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.350
 from the bomb technicians because they have 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.420
 explained the carabinieri with the 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.580
 deflagration of the whole area took place 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.320
 bombs scattered with bombs 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.630
 which are made fireworks 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.910
 it will be very difficult to recover the bodies 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.830
 or what remains is three missing 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.840
 because the epicenter of the devastating 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.459
 explosion is felt in the radius of 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.440
 kilometers has actually taken place 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:27.269
 inside the factory press where 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.269
 they were working and 3 playing
