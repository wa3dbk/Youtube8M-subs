how to change this to channel exponent

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.140 
how to change this to channel exponent
into<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.059> 4<00:00:12.780> channel<00:00:12.860> or<00:00:13.860> three<00:00:14.400> channel<00:00:14.759> this

demonstration<00:00:15.570> mixer<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.820> i've<00:00:17.820> been

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
demonstration mixer and i've been

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.340 
demonstration mixer and i've been
listening<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.480> lot<00:00:18.539> of<00:00:18.660> girl<00:00:18.930> talk<00:00:19.109> lately

listening to a lot of girl talk lately

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.900 
listening to a lot of girl talk lately
and<00:00:19.619> if<00:00:19.710> you<00:00:19.770> don't<00:00:20.010> know<00:00:20.130> who<00:00:20.250> girl<00:00:20.490> talk<00:00:20.699> is

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
and if you don't know who girl talk is

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.689 
and if you don't know who girl talk is
they<00:00:21.359> do<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.570> bunch<00:00:21.810> of<00:00:21.930> mashups<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.740> mashups

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
they do a bunch of mashups and mashups

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.519 
they do a bunch of mashups and mashups
are<00:00:23.850> basically<00:00:24.269> bunch<00:00:24.630> of<00:00:24.779> songs<00:00:24.960> piled<00:00:25.350> over

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
are basically bunch of songs piled over

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.700 
are basically bunch of songs piled over
each<00:00:25.769> other<00:00:25.949> very<00:00:26.279> very<00:00:26.460> quickly<00:00:27.080> so<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.349> was

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
each other very very quickly so I was

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.320 
each other very very quickly so I was
trying<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:28.980> experiment<00:00:29.400> with<00:00:29.580> this<00:00:29.849> guy<00:00:30.029> on

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
trying to experiment with this guy on

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.630 
trying to experiment with this guy on
how<00:00:30.990> we<00:00:31.050> could<00:00:31.380> put<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:32.099> bunch<00:00:32.279> of<00:00:32.369> tracks

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
how we could put a bunch of tracks

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.790 
how we could put a bunch of tracks
together<00:00:32.820> really<00:00:33.239> quickly<00:00:33.540> more<00:00:34.410> importantly

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
together really quickly more importantly

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.160 
together really quickly more importantly
how<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.070> layer<00:00:35.430> them<00:00:35.700> more<00:00:36.390> than<00:00:36.540> two<00:00:36.660> songs<00:00:36.960> at

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
how to layer them more than two songs at

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.979 
how to layer them more than two songs at
a<00:00:37.230> time<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:38.250> think<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:38.760> found<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.239> system<00:00:39.719> that

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
a time and I think I found a system that

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.410 
a time and I think I found a system that
kind<00:00:40.590> of<00:00:40.770> works<00:00:41.280> what<00:00:42.000> we're<00:00:42.149> going<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.390> be

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
kind of works what we're going to be

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.030 
kind of works what we're going to be
using<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.960> we're<00:00:43.170> going<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.350> be<00:00:43.469> using<00:00:43.680> an

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
using is we're going to be using an

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.450 
using is we're going to be using an
effect<00:00:44.520> called<00:00:44.610> repeat<00:00:45.829> and<00:00:46.829> we're<00:00:47.280> going<00:00:47.430> to

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
effect called repeat and we're going to

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.130 
effect called repeat and we're going to
be<00:00:47.550> controlling<00:00:47.969> this<00:00:48.059> repeat<00:00:48.450> effect<00:00:48.719> over

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
be controlling this repeat effect over

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.139 
be controlling this repeat effect over
here<00:00:49.469> just<00:00:50.340> hitting<00:00:50.640> this<00:00:50.760> button<00:00:50.940> will

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
here just hitting this button will

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.840 
here just hitting this button will
activate<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.079> turn<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.649> on<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.190> then<00:00:53.250> this

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
activate it and turn it on and then this

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.500 
activate it and turn it on and then this
just<00:00:54.120> controls<00:00:54.480> how<00:00:54.809> big<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.350> loop<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.739> is

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
just controls how big of a loop that is

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.360 
just controls how big of a loop that is
right<00:00:57.510> now<00:00:57.690> we<00:00:57.750> have<00:00:58.020> queued<00:00:58.350> up<00:00:58.469> empire<00:00:59.070> state

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
right now we have queued up empire state

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:08.179 
right now we have queued up empire state
of<00:00:59.430> mind<00:00:59.550> by<00:01:00.149> jay-z<00:01:06.020> as<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.290> can<00:01:07.409> see<00:01:07.619> this<00:01:07.979> is

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
of mind by jay-z as you can see this is

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.520 
of mind by jay-z as you can see this is
the<00:01:08.220> section<00:01:08.610> we<00:01:08.909> want<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.360> loop<00:01:09.990> this<00:01:10.290> is<00:01:10.439> the

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
the section we want to loop this is the

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.830 
the section we want to loop this is the
part<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:10.770> we<00:01:11.010> want<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.310> put<00:01:11.460> on<00:01:11.580> our<00:01:11.970> repeat

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
part that we want to put on our repeat

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:21.890 
part that we want to put on our repeat
so<00:01:13.799> we<00:01:14.159> are<00:01:14.310> just<00:01:14.340> going<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.850> play<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:20.630> and<00:01:21.630> as

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
so we are just going to play it and as

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.320 
so we are just going to play it and as
you<00:01:22.080> can<00:01:22.229> see<00:01:22.259> our<00:01:22.680> repeat<00:01:23.490> effect<00:01:23.820> or<00:01:24.210> you

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
you can see our repeat effect or you

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.219 
you can see our repeat effect or you
probably<00:01:24.570> won't<00:01:24.720> be<00:01:24.810> able<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:24.990> see<00:01:25.110> because

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
probably won't be able to see because

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.969 
probably won't be able to see because
it's<00:01:25.439> blurry<00:01:25.740> but<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:26.610> says<00:01:26.970> two<00:01:27.900> bars<00:01:28.170> so

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
it's blurry but that says two bars so

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.830 
it's blurry but that says two bars so
this<00:01:29.159> repeats<00:01:29.549> going<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.850> be<00:01:30.060> counting<00:01:30.720> these

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
this repeats going to be counting these

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.560 
this repeats going to be counting these
two<00:01:31.079> bars<00:01:31.290> are<00:01:31.530> being<00:01:31.799> looped<00:01:32.070> right<00:01:32.430> here<00:01:32.670> so

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
two bars are being looped right here so

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:43.530 
two bars are being looped right here so
all<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:33.900> need<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.229> do<00:01:34.470> is<00:01:34.710> just<00:01:35.659> hit<00:01:36.659> it

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.690 

and<00:01:44.540> there<00:01:44.780> we<00:01:44.869> go<00:01:44.990> that<00:01:45.380> loop<00:01:45.619> is<00:01:45.890> now<00:01:46.189> stored

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
and there we go that loop is now stored

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.359 
and there we go that loop is now stored
in<00:01:46.939> this<00:01:47.299> repeat<00:01:47.810> option<00:01:48.200> in<00:01:48.530> this<00:01:48.979> repeat

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
in this repeat option in this repeat

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.490 
in this repeat option in this repeat
effect<00:01:49.960> even<00:01:50.960> though<00:01:51.049> the<00:01:51.170> track<00:01:51.350> is<00:01:51.470> not

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
effect even though the track is not

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.920 
effect even though the track is not
playing<00:01:51.939> this<00:01:52.939> is<00:01:53.149> controls<00:01:53.509> the<00:01:53.600> wet<00:01:53.750> and<00:01:53.780> dry

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
playing this is controls the wet and dry

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.039 
playing this is controls the wet and dry
and<00:01:54.170> how<00:01:54.860> much<00:01:55.009> we<00:01:55.220> can<00:01:55.369> actually<00:01:55.549> hear<00:01:55.820> that

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049 
and how much we can actually hear that

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:58.300 
and how much we can actually hear that
right<00:01:57.049> here<00:01:57.200> we<00:01:57.380> can't<00:01:57.590> hear<00:01:57.770> it<00:01:57.830> at<00:01:57.979> all<00:01:58.070> want

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
right here we can't hear it at all want

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.960 
right here we can't hear it at all want
to<00:01:58.340> bring<00:01:58.520> it<00:01:58.610> back<00:01:58.759> up<00:01:59.000> there<00:01:59.869> it<00:01:59.990> is<00:02:00.430> so<00:02:01.430> now

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
with this effect or with Empire say mine

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.120 
with this effect or with Empire say mine
going<00:02:05.270> we<00:02:05.750> can<00:02:05.869> actually<00:02:06.200> bring<00:02:06.409> in<00:02:06.619> another

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
going we can actually bring in another

as<00:05:17.330> well<00:05:17.630> so<00:05:18.260> you<00:05:18.349> pretty<00:05:18.500> much<00:05:18.620> i<00:05:18.800> have<00:05:18.889> 4

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
as well so you pretty much i have 4

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.700 
as well so you pretty much i have 4
loops<00:05:19.340> or<00:05:19.729> four<00:05:19.970> songs<00:05:20.240> i<00:05:20.599> should<00:05:21.200> be<00:05:21.320> two

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
loops or four songs i should be two

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.520 
loops or four songs i should be two
songs<00:05:22.010> and<00:05:22.370> then<00:05:22.490> two<00:05:23.030> loops<00:05:23.300> going<00:05:23.660> all<00:05:23.870> at

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
songs and then two loops going all at

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.260 
songs and then two loops going all at
the<00:05:24.620> same<00:05:24.830> time<00:05:24.889> you<00:05:25.760> just<00:05:25.789> got<00:05:26.120> to<00:05:26.150> be

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
the same time you just got to be

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.060 
the same time you just got to be
creative<00:05:26.539> and<00:05:26.990> hopefully<00:05:27.470> this<00:05:27.680> gives<00:05:27.830> you<00:05:28.010> an

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
creative and hopefully this gives you an

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.950 
creative and hopefully this gives you an
idea<00:05:28.310> of<00:05:28.580> what<00:05:28.700> you<00:05:29.090> can<00:05:29.120> do<00:05:29.360> with<00:05:29.510> the<00:05:29.660> ex

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
idea of what you can do with the ex

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.060 
idea of what you can do with the ex

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
session and sorry this is the actual x

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.070 
session and sorry this is the actual x
session<00:05:34.520> this<00:05:34.669> is<00:05:34.820> the<00:05:34.910> exponent<00:05:35.240> what<00:05:35.960> you

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
session this is the exponent what you

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.159 
session this is the exponent what you
can<00:05:36.229> just<00:05:36.260> do<00:05:36.650> with<00:05:36.979> a<00:05:37.010> little<00:05:37.400> creativity<00:05:37.610> and

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:38.169 
can just do with a little creativity and

can just do with a little creativity and
i'm<00:05:39.169> definitely<00:05:39.680> going<00:05:39.770> to<00:05:39.919> try<00:05:39.950> and

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:40.099 
i'm definitely going to try and

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:42.490 
i'm definitely going to try and
practices<00:05:40.760> and<00:05:41.060> integrate<00:05:41.510> it<00:05:41.720> into<00:05:41.900> future

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
practices and integrate it into future

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.140 
practices and integrate it into future
