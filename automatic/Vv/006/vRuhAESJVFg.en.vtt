00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 and of course I’m a little sorry for what 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.350
 team suwon play for what these guys 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.750
 somewhere could not realize their 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.120
 ideas they played well received 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.660
 advantage in some matches for sure 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.820
 at least I will say for all the fights but 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.010
 just missed the chance of their 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.470
 hands they played against navi mostly 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.160
 positioning on the steppes they once 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.840
 tried to play the positioner more precisely 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.760
 two times did not try not to play 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.009
 they succeeded in positioning once 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.260
 when they went aggressive so easy 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:39.120
 in pvp and the second time they almost 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.090
 It turned out that this fight is now we 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.829
 show yes these are the steppes where they have 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.899
 everything was very cool they counterattacked 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.940
 natali what is not there strike down they are there 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.460
 explain and bravado is the same cute 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.930
 so they killed two tanks but for some reason 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.370
 why the second part of them all 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:00.090
 groups which was about 1 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.800
 base did not decide to gather in a blanket here 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.170
 these were just waiting for something and then 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.790
 counterattacked he drove here yes at 30 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.430
 deuce and there also remained 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.290
 that is, well, in general, in general, they 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.330
 could somehow this situation be better 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.820
 act out if you go in the middle 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.659
 pass just to the rescue and 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.759
 regrouped grouped with 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.700
 the rest of the vata that would have turned out that 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.100
 na'vi already had a loss in two tanks 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.380
 would either attack them or they would just 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.540
 navi would not have gone to them already 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.490
 one could bring something three by one 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.650
 the people and Paul simply chose another 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.509
 the direction would just be centered 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.579
 The site does not thread with its remaining 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.600
 tanks and not lost huge 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.700
 amount hp in fact and just but here 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.770
 Elementary situation did not guess what 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.850
 30 deuce is likely to stay here. 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.490
 they are about, let us shave 32 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:53.700
 chased two unfortunately 30 deuce 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.619
 the tank is quite tenacious and to rest time to 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.799
 bodies just until the moment when 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.920
 the joy came as a result of the NPC 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.860
 greedy and paid for it yes and 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.070
 lost in fact already won and for them 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.689
 would 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.259
 come seemingly heard friends and 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:12.330
 the commentators reaction this moment is her 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.730
 if you have heard our reaction too we 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.620
 just resented about it 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.170
 the guys had to play much 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.030
 more reliable they are well aware they 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.830
 play against born to win 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.840
 in the end here every little thing should 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.360
 be trained to the maximum here 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.069
 every tactic and strategy and decision 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.280
 which a player takes in a fight should 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.620
 be solely correct regret 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.629
 not everywhere and not always this happened in 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.420
 including like another fight which i 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:41.489
 also here we are just now with arthritis 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.470
 grew up waiting for the last battle in the mines 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:47.819
 one and a half thousand hit points advantages and 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.650
 positional some such chips 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.569
 which is already very difficult to contort and 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.610
 still not losing and 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.640
 precisely and probably also this fight we too 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.470
 now let's show you because well yes 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.319
 friends are simple some kind of chips that 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.050
 occur in any standard battle this 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.940
 you can't play navi like that 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.650
 come up with some interesting tactics and 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.230
 try to surprise born win 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.019
 then you girls that they have become 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.300
 dead hold because even if u 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:18.150
 you take a slide then these tanks from 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.830
 selections from anatolic positions they are there in 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.349
 principle can knock as much as you like 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:25.440
 here we see that just went building 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:28.080
 immediately brought down even navi here in uncomfortable 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.390
 position under the slide from the slide is very 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.790
 not bad you can throw a very strike 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.650
 shave off practically there for free and here 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.870
 just remember this number here 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.810
 now pause for 300 differences 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.430
 practical one and a half thousand hepe 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.280
 benefits and in fact they are about me here 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.680
 these one and a half thousand that's what is dying 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.680
 Now strike and even 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.080
 successful counterattack reflected simple 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.569
 cities get lost cod better by what they 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.239
 the slides don't work out well 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:59.010
 strongly substituted 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.689
 greedy just started to pop out 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.080
 they gun does not lean not och 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:05.970
 leaning out they just caught there and 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.689
 shot back although they could in principle 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:12.209
 this situation is a little easier somehow 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:15.120
 play out that is not to hang like this 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:17.220
 that's just quite well okay already killed in 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.410
 the remains but you win by hp and 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.519
 try to play something else 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.770
 i.e 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.050
 for example go down the hill try 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.509
 wring out the other half of the card that is 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.270
 how to do something like this put the tank on 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:32.639
 capture someone will remain on the hill to follow 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.770
 someone will drive over here on the way 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.780
 you can still take the slide because 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.470
 that he will be covered from the hill already 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:42.360
 look for 4 that is, well, different in the situation 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:46.080
 could be but that's it just 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:49.199
 hang out when tanks are covered uphill but 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.810
 This is an unfortunate decision and in general 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:54.210
 friends well some moments we still 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.580
 noted on others in others by yacht 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:59.970
 place shroud simply released 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:04.409
 victory in red-handed errors for some here 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:07.349
 so even i didn't want i wouldn't want 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:11.250
 speak tactical flaw me not 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:13.940
 before getting ready maybe somewhere for the map in 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:16.440
 general okay friends we don't care dad 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.629
 thanks team place shroud and team 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:22.289
 natus vincere for such a nice nice 

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:25.620
 the game that is, h 51 and you can even say 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:27.810
 that the game was she was exactly like 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.430
 and it should have been exactly that 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.690
 many predicted but I honestly 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.310
 hoping for a miracle 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:36.029
 Again , I have all sorts of biased opinion 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:38.490
 you all understand perfectly but yes 

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:41.669
 I am a little upset well thank you very much 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:44.759
 in general, all teams today today 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:45.599
 Loved the game especially the second 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:48.810
 a game 

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:51.830
 tense very well and tomorrow we have 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:55.199
 expect at least a tough match 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:59.270
 tomorrow yes friends, I would note after all 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:06:01.440
 one meeting that tomorrow me in khan 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.659
 makes you think it’s stuck and 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.849
 against hellraisers regret in the world that 

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:08.639
 the last game is very much 

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:11.909
 questions to us and to another team and 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:13.740
 too, so far no one is ready to predict 

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:15.960
 what result will be in this match 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.539
 because in fact whiplay which 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:22.710
 it seems like they got back in shape 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:24.719
 let's say steel with knees and asher and which 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.370
 which is not clear what is with them there 

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:28.979
 happens on incomprehensible what is happening 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.260
 but basically last last 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:32.810
 time no less 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:34.820
 show a good game but the last 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:36.980
 time is just like weplay that is 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:40.130
 we understand that everything seems to be 

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:42.800
 so rovnenko and again remember the match 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:44.560
 teams hellraisers lan-finals against 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:48.050
 the weplay teams where they lost and 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:50.570
 remained in third place then still in 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.520
 Minsk but friends wish good luck again 

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:52.940
 Plus, you'll see two more tomorrow. 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.360
 match 

00:06:52.940 --> 00:07:00.410
 This team tornado vs rox.kis with us 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:04.100
 playing and one more fight this now i 

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:06.470
 Quickly open the schedule so that 

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:10.880
 remind me please who is tomorrow for us 

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:16.040
 still playing the remaining two teams all 

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:17.150
 The remaining two teams will be dns son 

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.800
 defort 

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:20.390
 lessons and all right, thank you 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.370
 great director we have another one 

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:22.730
 meeting us against arcane by the way again 

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.500
 same too 

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:28.610
 she raises a lot of questions 

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:31.040
 again arcane seems to me already gone 

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:34.610
 that point of no return after which 

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:37.730
 it would make sense somehow a little kombat 

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:40.580
 in terms of their skill in terms of their games 

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:43.670
 level that is for them now me 

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:45.850
 It seems to remain this season, only you 

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:45.850
 st
