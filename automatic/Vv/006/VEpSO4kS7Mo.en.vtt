00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
hi guys it's luke with Stu Lulu um we've

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.099 
hi guys it's luke with Stu Lulu um we've
had<00:00:04.740> a<00:00:04.799> lot<00:00:05.250> of<00:00:05.310> people<00:00:05.580> asking<00:00:06.089> us<00:00:06.270> if<00:00:06.540> it<00:00:06.990> was

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
had a lot of people asking us if it was

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.680 
had a lot of people asking us if it was
possible<00:00:07.259> for<00:00:07.589> the<00:00:07.799> board<00:00:08.069> to<00:00:08.099> emulate<00:00:08.730> mouse

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
possible for the board to emulate mouse

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.120 
possible for the board to emulate mouse
buttons<00:00:11.269> at<00:00:12.269> this<00:00:12.990> time<00:00:13.259> our<00:00:13.590> software

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
buttons at this time our software

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.440 
buttons at this time our software
doesn't<00:00:14.370> support<00:00:14.759> it<00:00:14.910> neither<00:00:15.089> does<00:00:15.269> our

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
doesn't support it neither does our

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.580 
doesn't support it neither does our
firmware<00:00:16.020> but<00:00:16.500> there<00:00:16.859> are<00:00:17.270> ways<00:00:18.270> of<00:00:18.510> making<00:00:19.470> it

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
firmware but there are ways of making it

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.290 
firmware but there are ways of making it
happen<00:00:19.740> right<00:00:20.369> now<00:00:20.430> I'm<00:00:20.670> using<00:00:20.789> this<00:00:21.060> program

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
happen right now I'm using this program

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.779 
happen right now I'm using this program
called<00:00:21.630> glove<00:00:21.900> pie<00:00:22.310> which<00:00:23.310> is<00:00:23.430> really<00:00:23.580> cool

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
called glove pie which is really cool

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.019 
called glove pie which is really cool
because<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.180> lets<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:25.250> emulate<00:00:26.250> any<00:00:26.490> type<00:00:27.000> of

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
because it lets you emulate any type of

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.179 
because it lets you emulate any type of
buttons<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.900> any<00:00:28.230> other<00:00:28.619> types<00:00:28.980> of

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
buttons to any other types of

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.790 
buttons to any other types of
peripherals<00:00:30.000> for<00:00:30.210> this<00:00:31.080> demo<00:00:31.380> I'm<00:00:31.529> just<00:00:31.679> going

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
peripherals for this demo I'm just going

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.990 
peripherals for this demo I'm just going
to<00:00:31.830> show<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.070> guys<00:00:32.279> how<00:00:32.340> it's<00:00:32.610> done<00:00:32.790> with<00:00:32.969> a

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
to show you guys how it's done with a

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.780 
to show you guys how it's done with a
mouse<00:00:33.210> but<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:34.140> mean<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.280> could<00:00:35.399> really<00:00:35.640> do

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
mouse but I mean you could really do

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.680 
mouse but I mean you could really do
anything<00:00:36.360> got<00:00:37.020> joysticks<00:00:37.680> or<00:00:38.690> wiimote

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
anything got joysticks or wiimote

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.270 
anything got joysticks or wiimote
whatever<00:00:40.379> anyway<00:00:41.660> so<00:00:42.660> for<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.930> demo<00:00:43.110> I<00:00:43.410> have<00:00:43.770> a

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
whatever anyway so for the demo I have a

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.660 
whatever anyway so for the demo I have a
keyboard<00:00:44.879> on<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.480> keyboard<00:00:45.840> p<00:00:46.160> map<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.430> mouse

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
keyboard on the keyboard p map to mouse

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.630 
keyboard on the keyboard p map to mouse
left<00:00:48.000> button<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.510> keyboard<00:00:49.260> Oh<00:00:49.469> mapped<00:00:50.280> to

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
left button and keyboard Oh mapped to

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.090 
left button and keyboard Oh mapped to
the<00:00:51.059> mouse<00:00:51.329> right<00:00:51.629> button<00:00:51.890> within<00:00:52.890> our

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
the mouse right button within our

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.010 
the mouse right button within our
software<00:00:53.550> what<00:00:53.879> I've<00:00:54.000> done<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.420> I've<00:00:54.809> mapped

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
software what I've done is I've mapped

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.270 
software what I've done is I've mapped
the<00:00:55.199> heel<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.649> my<00:00:55.890> right<00:00:56.250> foot<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.820> 0<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:58.280> the

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
the heel of my right foot to 0 and the

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.759 
the heel of my right foot to 0 and the
heel<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.910> my<00:01:00.000> left<00:01:00.449> foot<00:01:01.609> to<00:01:02.609> pee<00:01:02.870> so<00:01:03.870> I'll<00:01:04.500> show

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
heel of my left foot to pee so I'll show

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.140 
heel of my left foot to pee so I'll show
you<00:01:04.830> guys<00:01:04.979> how<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.280> is<00:01:05.369> in<00:01:05.489> game<00:01:05.670> so<00:01:05.880> I'm<00:01:05.970> using

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
you guys how it is in game so I'm using

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.789 
you guys how it is in game so I'm using
two<00:01:06.420> boards<00:01:06.689> here<00:01:06.840> for<00:01:07.020> this<00:01:07.170> which<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.619> kind

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
two boards here for this which is kind

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.230 
two boards here for this which is kind
of<00:01:07.830> cool<00:01:09.049> here<00:01:10.049> we<00:01:10.170> go<00:01:10.380> oh<00:01:10.680> one<00:01:11.159> sec<00:01:11.430> turn<00:01:12.060> these

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
of cool here we go oh one sec turn these

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.090 
of cool here we go oh one sec turn these
things<00:01:12.450> off

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:25.490 

and<00:01:20.480> so<00:01:21.740> basically<00:01:22.740> my<00:01:22.950> right<00:01:23.700> heel<00:01:23.940> is<00:01:24.500> zoom

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
and so basically my right heel is zoom

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.710 
and so basically my right heel is zoom
or<00:01:25.880> a<00:01:26.880> my<00:01:27.090> guess<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.630> my<00:01:28.440> left<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.920> fire<00:01:29.510> so<00:01:30.510> I

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
or a my guess and my left is fire so I

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.110 
or a my guess and my left is fire so I
can<00:01:30.990> do<00:01:31.080> both<00:01:31.230> at<00:01:31.440> once<00:01:31.730> you'll<00:01:32.730> wreck<00:01:32.940> you'll

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
can do both at once you'll wreck you'll

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.330 
can do both at once you'll wreck you'll
notice<00:01:33.480> on<00:01:33.570> our<00:01:33.600> overlay<00:01:34.230> here<00:01:34.440> that<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:35.130> toe

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
notice on our overlay here that the toe

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.580 
notice on our overlay here that the toe
part<00:01:35.670> right<00:01:35.850> now<00:01:36.030> is<00:01:36.240> doing<00:01:36.510> p<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:37.170> reason<00:01:37.470> why

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
part right now is doing p the reason why

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.080 
part right now is doing p the reason why
I'm<00:01:37.740> doing<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.490> just<00:01:38.670> wanted<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:38.940> show
