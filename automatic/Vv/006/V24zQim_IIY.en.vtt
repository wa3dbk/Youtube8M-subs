00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.190
 I'm going to do actions, we're going to learn what 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.390
 simple that is to change a tire with 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.390
 two or three tools that we have 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:15.200
 we need an essential field 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:19.150
 know to force the nuts of the 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.150
 wheels and the flat tire 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.970
 we started to develop the wheel always 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.220
 the screws in the opposite direction of 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.230
 the clock hands many times we 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.210
 we put to unscrew the what 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.610
 we do it is to press it always sense 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.730
 put the clock hands together remove the 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.730
 nuts 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:42.250
 always with the car 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.250
 without having gone up as via 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.820
 if any answer too much we can 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.880
 do strength with the foot 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.230
 how is this important for example? 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.720
 but what check do we have 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.910
 No security screw that none 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.980
 of the five nuts that the car carries 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.930
 is about safety if we had 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.300
 some safety touch we would need 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.300
 the key to be able to fix it 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.229
 ok we have loosened the screws 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.979
 now we are going to proceed to lift the 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.979
 vehicle with the cat 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.380
 we place the cat in the part 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.380
 prepared in the chassis 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.330
 we always have here as a small 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.500
 slit in the chassis where it should go 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.500
 place it sarcastic 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.490
 perfect and we started to climb 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.660
 at the entrance 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.660
 yes 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.810
 we already have the cat placed and we started 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.810
 going up 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.760
 as we can see everything because it makes you a 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.620
 extraordinary strength 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.310
 thank you very much better has ensured that 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.310
 It is well placed 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.380
 the car is sufficiently I have 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.880
 uploaded like that the steal turn in the 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.330
 air 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:29.770
 more reason according to this year I think that already 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.770
 we could take the if 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.390
 we finished evicting the doors 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.710
 but agreement 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.850
 we have always developed them without having 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.590
 the car went up 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.690
 it is possible that on some occasion a 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.690
 no doubt we come out that is fit 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.190
 it's one thought out 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.630
 and we must make it fit each screw 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.120
 Corresponding and good hole course 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:23.120
 corresponding to what there is 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.120
 plus 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.269
 there really is not a hole for each 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.890
 screw just then that the five 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:31.659
 screws in this case is surrounded by 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.900
 five screws fit into those five 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:33.900
 holes 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.160
 to launch the vehicle put in 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.370
 relationship the other way around we started doing 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.930
 the mouse 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.930
 clockwise 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.780
 do not 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.180
 and now we go to the last one tightens for 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.799
 behind 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.799
 clockwise 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:17.500
 for the last criticism 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.500
 we help ourselves a little bit of standing 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.940
 we will work less 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:33.919
 important to talk about changing the 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:35.960
 tire we should look for a place 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.849
 appropriate to do it if we see that 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.409
 our security is in danger 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:42.289
 we better call the assistance service 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:45.409
 road so agree a site 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:48.070
 Appropriate reflective vest and change 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:49.450
 the wheel is very simple 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.960
 see you later in the next 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.960
 video
