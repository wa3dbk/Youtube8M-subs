hi<00:00:01.350> guys<00:00:01.680> welcome<00:00:02.070> to<00:00:02.310> this<00:00:02.580> new<00:00:02.639> tutorial<00:00:03.090> on

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
hi guys welcome to this new tutorial on

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.200 
hi guys welcome to this new tutorial on
advanced<00:00:04.140> beam<00:00:04.560> techniques<00:00:05.130> today<00:00:05.910> we're

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
advanced beam techniques today we're

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.390 
advanced beam techniques today we're
going<00:00:06.359> to<00:00:06.420> be<00:00:06.600> looking<00:00:06.750> at<00:00:07.170> a<00:00:07.470> way<00:00:08.340> to

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
going to be looking at a way to

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.589 
going to be looking at a way to
transform<00:00:09.090> diagrams<00:00:09.750> into<00:00:10.139> architecture<00:00:10.830> and

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:11.599 
transform diagrams into architecture and

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:14.690 
transform diagrams into architecture and
usually<00:00:12.599> when<00:00:12.780> you<00:00:12.929> design<00:00:13.410> floor<00:00:14.040> plans<00:00:14.370> for

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
usually when you design floor plans for

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.180 
usually when you design floor plans for
instance<00:00:15.120> you<00:00:15.839> trace<00:00:16.170> your<00:00:16.379> sketches<00:00:16.949> with<00:00:17.160> a

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
instance you trace your sketches with a

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:25.849 
instance you trace your sketches with a
line<00:00:20.000> then<00:00:21.000> you<00:00:21.180> extrude<00:00:21.600> this<00:00:21.779> line<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:24.859> then

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
line then you extrude this line and then

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.580 
line then you extrude this line and then
you<00:00:25.980> have<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.369> go<00:00:26.519> through<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.300> long<00:00:28.289> process

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
you have to go through the long process

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.190 
you have to go through the long process
of<00:00:29.010> exploring<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.300> element<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:32.780> settle<00:00:33.780> the

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
of exploring the element of settle the

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.370 
of exploring the element of settle the
walls<00:00:34.950> ceilings<00:00:35.880> string<00:00:36.420> them<00:00:36.660> together<00:00:36.870> and

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
walls ceilings string them together and

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.270 
walls ceilings string them together and
create<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.160> solid<00:00:38.430> geometry<00:00:39.739> instead<00:00:40.739> there

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
create a solid geometry instead there

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.510 
create a solid geometry instead there
are<00:00:41.309> some<00:00:41.670> very<00:00:42.000> simple<00:00:43.430> definitions<00:00:44.430> that

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
are some very simple definitions that

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.670 
are some very simple definitions that
you<00:00:44.730> can<00:00:44.910> write<00:00:45.180> in<00:00:45.360> grasshopper<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:46.260> can<00:00:46.469> do

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
you can write in grasshopper that can do

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.729 
you can write in grasshopper that can do
that<00:00:46.890> for<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.340> so<00:00:48.059> for<00:00:48.270> instance<00:00:48.329> if<00:00:48.840> here<00:00:49.530> we

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
that for you so for instance if here we

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.310 
that for you so for instance if here we
have<00:00:49.890> funny<00:00:50.280> form<00:00:53.600> we<00:00:54.600> can<00:00:54.629> just<00:00:55.020> tell

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
have funny form we can just tell

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.890 
have funny form we can just tell
grasshopper

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.620 

to<00:01:01.470> this<00:01:01.830> for<00:01:02.160> us<00:01:02.280> let<00:01:02.640> me<00:01:02.790> flip<00:01:03.090> this<00:01:03.120> curve

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:03.630 
to this for us let me flip this curve

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:10.250 
to this for us let me flip this curve
there<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.440> is<00:01:06.020> so<00:01:07.020> now<00:01:07.230> if<00:01:07.470> we<00:01:07.500> bake<00:01:09.260> this

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
there it is so now if we bake this

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.530 
there it is so now if we bake this
geometry<00:01:12.710> okay<00:01:13.710> select<00:01:14.400> everything<00:01:14.760> we<00:01:15.270> run<00:01:15.510> a

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
geometry okay select everything we run a

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.400 
geometry okay select everything we run a
section<00:01:16.110> through<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:17.810> we<00:01:18.810> can<00:01:19.020> see<00:01:19.230> what's

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:19.410 
section through it we can see what's

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:26.930 
section through it we can see what's
going<00:01:19.680> on<00:01:24.560> okay<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:25.620> now<00:01:26.070> we<00:01:26.130> can<00:01:26.430> look<00:01:26.640> at<00:01:26.790> the

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
going on okay so now we can look at the

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.540 
going on okay so now we can look at the
definition<00:01:27.380> definition<00:01:28.380> it's<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.950> very<00:01:29.220> simple

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
definition definition it's a very simple

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.750 
definition definition it's a very simple
definition<00:01:30.650> basically<00:01:31.650> are<00:01:31.800> going<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.370> create

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 
definition basically are going to create

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
definition basically are going to create
a<00:01:32.910> curve<00:01:34.550> you're<00:01:35.550> going<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.790> create<00:01:36.030> an<00:01:36.300> offset

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
a curve you're going to create an offset

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.740 
a curve you're going to create an offset
for<00:01:37.080> this<00:01:37.260> curve<00:01:37.820> now<00:01:38.820> as<00:01:39.000> long<00:01:39.240> as<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.510> work

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
for this curve now as long as you work

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.240 
for this curve now as long as you work
on<00:01:39.960> X<00:01:40.670> Y<00:01:41.670> coordinates<00:01:42.860> everything<00:01:43.860> it's<00:01:44.040> going

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
on X Y coordinates everything it's going

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.490 
on X Y coordinates everything it's going
to<00:01:44.310> be<00:01:44.460> very<00:01:44.790> simple<00:01:45.690> you're<00:01:45.900> not<00:01:46.200> going<00:01:46.410> to

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
to be very simple you're not going to

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.020 
to be very simple you're not going to
need<00:01:46.650> any<00:01:47.180> reference<00:01:48.180> plane<00:01:49.760> we're<00:01:50.760> gonna

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
need any reference plane we're gonna

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.180 
need any reference plane we're gonna
going<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:51.960> be<00:01:52.050> looking<00:01:52.350> at<00:01:52.500> these<00:01:52.740> techniques

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
going to be looking at these techniques

00:01:53.190 --> 00:02:00.950 
going to be looking at these techniques
also<00:01:53.580> in<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.910> future<00:01:59.240> then<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.450> cannot<00:02:00.690> be

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
also in the future then you cannot be

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.880 
also in the future then you cannot be
using<00:02:01.470> a<00:02:01.740> couple<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.759> sliders<00:02:03.830> commodity<00:02:04.830> I'm

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
using a couple of sliders commodity I'm

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.229 
using a couple of sliders commodity I'm
just<00:02:05.160> gonna<00:02:05.310> copy<00:02:05.550> this<00:02:05.700> one's<00:02:07.880> and<00:02:08.880> in<00:02:09.119> this

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
just gonna copy this one's and in this

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.240 
just gonna copy this one's and in this
case<00:02:09.480> one<00:02:09.959> it's<00:02:10.140> going<00:02:10.350> to<00:02:10.440> define<00:02:10.769> the<00:02:11.040> wall

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
case one it's going to define the wall

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.070 
case one it's going to define the wall
height<00:02:11.519> and<00:02:11.850> the<00:02:12.450> other<00:02:12.570> one<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.900> wall

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
height and the other one the wall

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.009 
height and the other one the wall
thickness<00:02:16.370> then<00:02:17.370> next<00:02:17.850> we<00:02:18.150> cannot<00:02:18.360> be<00:02:18.630> taking

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
thickness then next we cannot be taking

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:24.140 
thickness then next we cannot be taking
an<00:02:19.110> extrusion<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:22.280> this<00:02:23.280> extrusion<00:02:23.820> we're

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
an extrusion and this extrusion we're

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.750 
an extrusion and this extrusion we're
going<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.390> be<00:02:24.510> extruding<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.550> original<00:02:26.550> line

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
going to be extruding the original line

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:38.800 
going to be extruding the original line
plus<00:02:27.330> D<00:02:27.630> of<00:02:28.580> that<00:02:29.580> line

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:51.470 

you<00:02:39.349> will<00:02:39.590> need<00:02:39.739> to<00:02:39.920> set<00:02:40.370> vector

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:03:03.030 

any<00:02:52.200> we<00:02:52.470> gonna<00:02:52.680> have<00:02:52.920> a<00:02:54.349> another<00:02:55.349> extrusion

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.929 

and<00:03:03.189> in<00:03:03.790> this<00:03:04.000> case<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.920> wall<00:03:06.159> height<00:03:06.459> of<00:03:06.790> this

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:06.939 
and in this case the wall height of this

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:10.080 
and in this case the wall height of this
extrusion<00:03:07.390> is<00:03:07.750> going<00:03:08.019> to<00:03:08.170> be<00:03:08.609> the<00:03:09.609> wall<00:03:09.819> height

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
extrusion is going to be the wall height

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.220 
extrusion is going to be the wall height
itself<00:03:10.859> minus<00:03:11.859> the<00:03:12.219> wall<00:03:12.430> thickness<00:03:13.019> so<00:03:14.019> we're

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
itself minus the wall thickness so we're

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.929 
itself minus the wall thickness so we're
going<00:03:14.349> to<00:03:14.469> look<00:03:14.590> at<00:03:14.739> a<00:03:14.799> subtraction<00:03:17.640> we<00:03:18.640> cannot

00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:18.939 
going to look at a subtraction we cannot

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:23.369 
going to look at a subtraction we cannot
input<00:03:19.239> a<00:03:19.659> near<00:03:20.400> be<00:03:21.400> in<00:03:21.640> here<00:03:21.939> and<00:03:22.810> use<00:03:23.019> another

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:23.379 
input a near be in here and use another

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:31.110 
input a near be in here and use another
set<00:03:24.540> vector<00:03:25.540> to<00:03:26.019> give<00:03:26.200> it<00:03:26.290> a<00:03:26.379> direction<00:03:29.730> so<00:03:30.730> if

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
set vector to give it a direction so if

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:47.010 
set vector to give it a direction so if
now<00:03:31.689> we<00:03:31.750> look<00:03:32.170> at<00:03:32.730> what's<00:03:33.730> going<00:03:33.849> on<00:03:34.120> in<00:03:34.180> here

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.840 

we'll<00:03:47.590> set<00:03:47.950> this<00:03:48.160> one<00:03:48.430> girl<00:03:50.070> and<00:03:51.070> we<00:03:51.520> flip<00:03:51.820> the

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
we'll set this one girl and we flip the

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.880 
we'll set this one girl and we flip the
curve

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.960 

so<00:03:57.550> now<00:03:57.730> we<00:03:57.790> see<00:03:58.150> that<00:03:58.360> we<00:03:58.600> have<00:03:58.630> am<00:03:59.970> an

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
so now we see that we have am an

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
so now we see that we have am an
interior<00:04:01.450> wall<00:04:01.650> exterior<00:04:02.650> wall<00:04:03.780> and<00:04:04.780> now<00:04:04.930> we

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:04.990 
interior wall exterior wall and now we

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.210 
interior wall exterior wall and now we
need<00:04:05.260> to<00:04:05.410> cut<00:04:05.800> this<00:04:07.560> tools<00:04:08.560> so<00:04:08.860> what<00:04:09.069> we're

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
need to cut this tools so what we're

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.930 
need to cut this tools so what we're
going<00:04:09.340> to<00:04:09.459> do<00:04:10.410> we<00:04:11.410> cannot<00:04:11.770> be<00:04:12.209> asking<00:04:13.209> for<00:04:13.540> a

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
going to do we cannot be asking for a

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:23.000 
going to do we cannot be asking for a
move<00:04:16.140> command<00:04:18.299> or<00:04:19.470> basically<00:04:20.470> are<00:04:20.739> going<00:04:21.040> to

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
move command or basically are going to

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:36.420 
move command or basically are going to
use<00:04:24.010> a<00:04:27.930> planner<00:04:29.070> surface<00:04:34.200> and<00:04:35.200> this<00:04:36.070> planner

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
use a planner surface and this planner

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:42.840 
use a planner surface and this planner
surface<00:04:37.120> is<00:04:37.360> going<00:04:37.720> to<00:04:38.430> move<00:04:41.460> up<00:04:42.460> together

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
surface is going to move up together

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.780 
surface is going to move up together
with<00:04:43.210> the<00:04:43.300> wall

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.040 

and<00:04:48.030> then<00:04:48.630> another<00:04:49.250> planar<00:04:50.250> surface<00:04:51.050> with

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
and then another planar surface with

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.620 
and then another planar surface with
your<00:04:52.230> set<00:04:53.630> we<00:04:54.630> did<00:04:54.780> another<00:04:54.990> move<00:04:56.450> that<00:04:57.450> it's

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
your set we did another move that it's

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:28.340 
your set we did another move that it's
going<00:04:57.930> to<00:04:58.140> use<00:04:58.350> the<00:04:58.800> same

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:48.839 

Verity's

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:48.849 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:50.999 

you<00:05:49.389> can<00:05:49.569> hide<00:05:49.809> the<00:05:49.869> rest<00:05:50.229> of<00:05:50.409> the<00:05:50.559> journal

00:05:50.999 --> 00:05:51.009 
you can hide the rest of the journal

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:59.140 
you can hide the rest of the journal
train

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:08.550 

yeah<00:06:00.460> to<00:06:02.560> this<00:06:03.560> we<00:06:03.860> can<00:06:04.040> also<00:06:04.190> hide<00:06:04.580> it<00:06:06.610> okay

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 
yeah to this we can also hide it okay

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.230 
yeah to this we can also hide it okay
we're<00:06:09.560> going<00:06:09.710> to<00:06:09.830> put<00:06:10.310> everything<00:06:10.700> into<00:06:11.060> a

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.240 
we're going to put everything into a

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:20.820 
we're going to put everything into a
geometry<00:06:12.020> tab<00:06:13.990> character<00:06:14.990> component<00:06:18.790> and

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830 
geometry tab character component and

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:28.750 
geometry tab character component and
bake<00:06:21.830> it<00:06:23.890> okay<00:06:26.620> as<00:06:27.620> you<00:06:27.860> can<00:06:27.920> see<00:06:28.040> we<00:06:28.520> have<00:06:28.550> our

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:28.760 
bake it okay as you can see we have our

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.160 
bake it okay as you can see we have our
solid<00:06:29.300> geometry<00:06:29.830> and<00:06:31.450> now<00:06:32.450> no<00:06:32.660> matter<00:06:32.840> which

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:33.170 
solid geometry and now no matter which

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:46.970 
solid geometry and now no matter which
curve<00:06:33.530> we're<00:06:33.800> going<00:06:33.980> to<00:06:34.040> use

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:46.980 

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:51.920 

this<00:06:47.610> is<00:06:47.760> always<00:06:48.150> gonna<00:06:48.390> give<00:06:48.690> us<00:06:49.580> an<00:06:50.930> element

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:51.930 
this is always gonna give us an element

00:06:51.930 --> 00:07:02.410 
this is always gonna give us an element
with<00:06:52.680> a<00:06:55.100> certain<00:06:56.100> wall<00:06:56.580> thickness<00:06:57.710> all<00:06:58.710> right

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:02.420 

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.800 

got<00:07:03.420> to<00:07:03.630> set<00:07:03.840> the<00:07:04.050> wall<00:07:04.230> thickness<00:07:04.770> also<00:07:05.010> for

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:05.810 
got to set the wall thickness also for

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:19.930 
got to set the wall thickness also for
the<00:07:06.810> offset<00:07:07.260> there<00:07:08.250> it<00:07:08.370> is

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:19.940 

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:23.320 

yeah<00:07:20.570> me<00:07:20.780> works<00:07:21.020> just<00:07:21.320> perfect<00:07:21.860> so<00:07:22.330> for

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:23.330 
yeah me works just perfect so for

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.760 
yeah me works just perfect so for
instance<00:07:23.420> if<00:07:23.960> you<00:07:24.140> want<00:07:24.350> to<00:07:24.440> grab<00:07:24.650> a<00:07:25.010> point<00:07:25.820> of

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:26.770 
instance if you want to grab a point of

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:30.670 
instance if you want to grab a point of
this<00:07:27.770> curve<00:07:28.070> and<00:07:28.280> pull<00:07:28.790> it<00:07:29.050> the<00:07:30.050> definition

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:30.680 
this curve and pull it the definition

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:38.860 
this curve and pull it the definition
will<00:07:31.570> update<00:07:32.570> by<00:07:33.500> itself<00:07:35.740> and<00:07:37.420> this<00:07:38.420> can<00:07:38.690> be<00:07:38.840> a

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:38.870 
will update by itself and this can be a

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:40.780 
will update by itself and this can be a
very<00:07:38.930> good<00:07:39.230> starting<00:07:39.920> point<00:07:40.190> for<00:07:40.490> you<00:07:40.640> to

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:40.790 
very good starting point for you to

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:46.030 
very good starting point for you to
start<00:07:41.060> creating<00:07:41.360> geometry<00:07:42.670> very<00:07:43.670> quickly<00:07:45.040> as

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:46.040 
start creating geometry very quickly as

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:50.130 
start creating geometry very quickly as
you<00:07:46.430> can<00:07:46.520> understand<00:07:46.970> you<00:07:47.150> can<00:07:47.180> repeat<00:07:48.790> these

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:50.140 
you can understand you can repeat these

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:53.770 
you can understand you can repeat these
definition<00:07:51.140> inside<00:07:51.530> grasshopper<00:07:52.280> and<00:07:52.780> create

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:53.780 
definition inside grasshopper and create

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:56.350 
definition inside grasshopper and create
a<00:07:54.050> different<00:07:54.710> elements<00:07:55.520> but<00:07:55.850> then<00:07:56.030> you<00:07:56.180> can

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:56.360 
a different elements but then you can

00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:00.040 
a different elements but then you can
put<00:07:57.050> together<00:07:57.260> and<00:07:57.680> combine<00:07:57.890> together<00:07:59.050> as

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:00.050 
put together and combine together as

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:02.170 
put together and combine together as
always<00:08:00.560> if<00:08:00.770> you<00:08:00.890> have<00:08:01.010> any<00:08:01.040> questions<00:08:01.610> any
