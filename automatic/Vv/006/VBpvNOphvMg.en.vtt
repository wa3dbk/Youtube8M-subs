when<00:02:02.180> I<00:02:02.360> think<00:02:02.420> a<00:02:02.690> bravery<00:02:03.110> I<00:02:03.200> think<00:02:03.770> of

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
when I think a bravery I think of

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.740 
when I think a bravery I think of
something<00:02:04.430> that<00:02:04.880> comes<00:02:05.060> from<00:02:05.390> the<00:02:05.570> inside

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
something that comes from the inside

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.830 
something that comes from the inside
what<00:02:06.740> appears<00:02:07.160> on<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:07.490> outside<00:02:07.910> but<00:02:08.149> what<00:02:08.750> you

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
what appears on the outside but what you

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.120 
what appears on the outside but what you
give<00:02:09.050> from<00:02:09.290> your<00:02:09.350> heart

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
give from your heart

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.620 
give from your heart
I<00:02:10.160> think<00:02:10.940> of<00:02:11.170> bravery<00:02:12.170> less<00:02:12.440> as<00:02:12.650> not<00:02:13.100> being

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
I think of bravery less as not being

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.610 
I think of bravery less as not being
afraid<00:02:14.630> as<00:02:15.670> not<00:02:16.670> letting<00:02:17.420> it<00:02:17.570> stop<00:02:18.050> you<00:02:18.350> from

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
afraid as not letting it stop you from

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.500 
afraid as not letting it stop you from
doing<00:02:18.920> something<00:02:19.310> that<00:02:19.730> you<00:02:19.910> think<00:02:20.060> has<00:02:20.300> to<00:02:20.330> be

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
doing something that you think has to be

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.840 
doing something that you think has to be
done<00:02:20.720> from<00:02:21.710> a<00:02:21.770> mother's<00:02:22.130> perspective<00:02:22.340> of

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
done from a mother's perspective of

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.640 
done from a mother's perspective of
