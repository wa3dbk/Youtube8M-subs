00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 hello and welcome the 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.700
 sports fans to battlefield tips and 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.189
 Tricks with me grew in this short 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.630
 video I show you how the active 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.400
 protection system work 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.230
 or the active protection like 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.820
 In Germany it is against what it is 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.770
 does not work against which 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.869
 shot in effective because there is in 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.000
 the danger of these shot the 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.070
 the active protection and rom go or 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.570
 just ignore it and see what happens 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.180
 also very interesting 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.990
 which bullets of the aps system too 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.359
 stop bringing 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.430
 that means there are a few bullets where 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.989
 when each will bombarded with the 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.550
 defense system simply stops too 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.770
 work as before in five seconds 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.309
 Absolutely it should be on 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.290
 should 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.510
 and of course I spend a lot of time in there 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.579
 spend armor and because the aps one 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.469
 my favorite equipment option is 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.090
 if that's very important, of course 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.879
 Know when exactly the thing works 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.829
 and when not in what is not 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.149
 So I'm with a buddy in two 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.670
 panzer jumped the have the whole 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.230
 tested and I want to know you 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.859
 Of course not to my loyal subscriber 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.559
 withhold 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.539
 Roughly speaking, the abs system works 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.189
 against everything with a few exceptions I 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.549
 after that will be called unemployed 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.350
 low rpgs panzer bullets the 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.210
 bursts out of the jet from the ointments 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.780
 helicopters the rockets come to the east 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:19.020
 another jet coming harness the salvos from 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.759
 So an ip stb rocket really everything 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.860
 what you think could say 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.790
 these are the exceptions the tv rockets 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.909
 and the mbt rbs and the stars so everything 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.100
 what is actively seeking or 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.920
 projectile, the active ones are the target 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.780
 looking at the tv packages you need 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.549
 Do not worry too much 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.350
 We will be very happy with those 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.750
 So far, that's always the case 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.299
 I have never been rocketed by a tv 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.689
 just did not hit the river 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.280
 if you drive boats there and the tv 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.780
 Packets of jets usually have 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.340
 easy to hit easily 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.710
 especially if you go there and 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.920
 water was a real one 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.560
 the mbt lms they are so bad 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.110
 you can not do anything against them and if 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.090
 304 engineers in any one 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.910
 have entrenched urban environment 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.470
 or behind any iron then 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.510
 you just do not have a chance 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.160
 I believe the best driver in the world 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.190
 could do nothing against them except 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.890
 that you bypass that one 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.580
 distance remains so you have to 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.060
 beware 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.730
 even if you have experienced the aps it is 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.910
 really a problem but against everything else 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.380
 Be prepared animal very well if 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.260
 any jets arrived 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.160
 easy exhaust system and nice as can 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.470
 do you nothing more 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.810
 or if you somehow sneak up 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.940
 to enemy armor first shot 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.650
 fire when he turns around 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.170
 and already is to celebrate you 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.970
 Aps to do you have an advantage now 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.470
 and if that's the case again from now on 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.650
 you can hide again and in 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.360
 cover so the second points do not go 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.420
 wanted to call was that some bullets 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.280
 finish the abs system and count 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:04.980
 the whole tank shot but also 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:06.299
 rpg source dj bombs from the jets and me 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.970
 So that's what it was all over 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:11.100
 heavy shot what aps not 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.380
 should end that theory is shot 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.360
 that, for example, the lav shoots that 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.190
 But it packed in the moment as it is in 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.900
 see this clip can the projectile 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.459
 hits me and then it goes immediately 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.090
 by what does not happen 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.070
 should 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.540
 But that does not always happen as well 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.070
 can see it in this clip here 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.920
 it works quite normally the theory 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:31.829
 do not stop the ips and the others 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.140
 pages go through what else whatsoever 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:36.060
 It is important to know that the system 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.070
 do not go out immediately if to one 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.900
 heavy bullet is hit but 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.090
 only after about a second 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.220
 that means he has one second now 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.320
 Before you the opponents 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.220
 bullets reoccur and damage 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.709
 can add 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.299
 in practice that would be especially in the 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.130
 tanks fight important because for example 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.959
 that's why you 're shot at by land 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.850
 in the opponent than three seconds 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.680
 that is if you have the eps at second 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.019
 Zero power and the enemy tank 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.470
 wise 1 could meet you once then 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:05.600
 the aps goes out and instruct customer 4 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.550
 can meet you again what you but 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.590
 Prevent with this knowledge now 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.450
 could then if you can 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.970
 just retreat into cover if you 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.070
 was hit once 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:19.970
 By the way, the dv rocket finished sap it 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.320
 also not at the mbc I am 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.450
 not sure we do not have it 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.440
 tested but if you knew it 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.840
 I'm glad if you put it in the 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.490
 would write comments or if I have 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.740
 later find out yourself then write 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.900
 i am the description of the videos what 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.580
 also very cool is that if you the aps 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.950
 and activated from the armor-out 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.050
 then jumps apps it always works 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.970
 that is, during a tank 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.340
 fight you could jump out shortly 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.210
 and the opponent's tank a rpg 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.520
 push in 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.170
 While this is not going to be in the fungus, though 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.300
 if it could not be otherwise now 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:52.340
 just do it without risk to run that you 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.650
 the enemy tank with one 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.060
 shoot change with jo I hope you 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.310
 finds the video useful and 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:01.580
 hopefully it will be on the 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.350
 battlefield help better equipped 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.690
 to be better informed and 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.220
 if you like the video or have 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.780
 I would be glad if I 'm sorry 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.890
 that could help that helps my videos 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.320
 to be found 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:13.880
 otherwise if you have something next 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.710
 panzer want to see video writes it 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.570
 just in the comments I 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.150
 always consider your wishes 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:22.669
 of course that's the fourth, by the way 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.350
 part in my series panzer tutorials in 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:25.790
 I have the first three videos 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.370
 treated how to stay longer in the tank 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:30.590
 survive the primary ammunition types and 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.240
 which mg is the best you have 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.890
 interested just look in 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.240
 the links are in the description and 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.750
 if I can subscribe here then I would 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.000
 I am happy 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:40.130
 I still have more tutorials for 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.120
 armor and infantry to do so 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.870
 thank you for watching 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.870
 until next time

 which is the best 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.790
 just look in
