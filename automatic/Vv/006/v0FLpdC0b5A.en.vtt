bumper to transform the actual figure go
ahead<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.390> fold<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.980> top<00:02:41.730> part<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.630> arms

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
and unfold the legs and then you go

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.340 
and unfold the legs and then you go
ahead<00:02:48.960> and<00:02:49.110> bump<00:02:49.710> it<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.940> bump<00:02:51.270> it<00:02:51.450> to<00:02:51.660> another

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
with another bot shots figure and then

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.710 
with another bot shots figure and then
your<00:02:54.660> you<00:02:54.930> both<00:02:55.140> reveal<00:02:56.300> what<00:02:57.300> symbol<00:02:57.630> you

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
your you both reveal what symbol you

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.290 
your you both reveal what symbol you
chose<00:02:57.960> and<00:02:58.170> you<00:02:58.260> decide<00:02:58.800> who<00:02:58.980> wins<00:02:59.190> in<00:03:00.030> event

chose and you decide who wins in event

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.080 
chose and you decide who wins in event
of<00:03:00.330> a<00:03:00.420> tie<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:01.200> number<00:03:02.190> on<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.580> side<00:03:02.790> will

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
of a tie the number on the side will

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.890 
of a tie the number on the side will
determine<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:03.600> winner

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
determine the winner

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.850 
determine the winner
so<00:03:04.470> to<00:03:04.560> launch<00:03:04.890> this<00:03:05.340> particular<00:03:05.670> figure

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
so to launch this particular figure

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.890 
so to launch this particular figure
transform<00:03:07.860> Optimus<00:03:08.670> Prime<00:03:08.940> is<00:03:09.150> old<00:03:09.480> look<00:03:09.690> I

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
transform Optimus Prime is old look I

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.390 
transform Optimus Prime is old look I
think<00:03:10.260> this<00:03:10.350> will<00:03:10.500> work<00:03:10.740> with<00:03:10.980> other<00:03:11.130> bought

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
think this will work with other bought

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.110 
think this will work with other bought
shots<00:03:11.730> go<00:03:12.120> ahead<00:03:12.270> and<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:12.690> trailer<00:03:14.120> like

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
shots go ahead and the trailer like

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.500 
shots go ahead and the trailer like
that<00:03:16.100> you<00:03:17.100> can<00:03:17.250> activate<00:03:17.640> it<00:03:17.790> by<00:03:17.820> pushing<00:03:18.240> the

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
that you can activate it by pushing the

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.570 
that you can activate it by pushing the
bumper<00:03:18.930> but<00:03:19.200> on<00:03:19.290> my<00:03:19.610> sort<00:03:20.610> of<00:03:20.730> doesn't<00:03:21.120> work

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
bumper but on my sort of doesn't work

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.970 
bumper but on my sort of doesn't work
the<00:03:23.580> bumper<00:03:23.910> is<00:03:24.000> kind<00:03:24.270> of<00:03:24.360> stuck<00:03:24.660> but<00:03:25.470> this<00:03:25.830> is

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
the bumper is kind of stuck but this is

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.710 
the bumper is kind of stuck but this is
the<00:03:26.100> best<00:03:26.310> way<00:03:26.520> I<00:03:26.550> think<00:03:26.700> to<00:03:27.000> activate<00:03:27.570> it<00:03:27.690> you

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
the best way I think to activate it you

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.199 
the best way I think to activate it you
push<00:03:28.050> the<00:03:28.170> gun<00:03:28.350> on<00:03:28.500> top<00:03:28.740> and<00:03:29.670> then<00:03:29.910> you<00:03:30.000> launch

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
push the gun on top and then you launch

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:35.290 
push the gun on top and then you launch
him<00:03:31.310> but<00:03:32.310> he<00:03:32.430> didn't<00:03:32.640> transform<00:03:33.060> it<00:03:33.209> so<00:03:33.480> it's

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
him but he didn't transform it so it's

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.590 
him but he didn't transform it so it's
ok<00:03:36.300> let's<00:03:37.290> try<00:03:37.530> and<00:03:37.770> see<00:03:37.920> if<00:03:38.070> you<00:03:38.220> can<00:03:38.400> have<00:03:39.390> up

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
ok let's try and see if you can have up

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.940 
ok let's try and see if you can have up
in<00:03:39.780> this<00:03:39.840> Prime<00:03:40.170> transform<00:03:42.530> and<00:03:43.530> that's<00:03:43.740> how<00:03:43.920> I

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
in this Prime transform and that's how I

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.280 
in this Prime transform and that's how I
essentially<00:03:44.400> use<00:03:44.820> the<00:03:45.000> launcher<00:03:45.420> it's<00:03:46.230> a

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
essentially use the launcher it's a

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.850 
essentially use the launcher it's a
pretty<00:03:46.470> cool<00:03:46.740> gimmick<00:03:47.690> but<00:03:48.690> out<00:03:49.110> of<00:03:49.290> all<00:03:49.560> the

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
pretty cool gimmick but out of all the

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.940 
pretty cool gimmick but out of all the
ones<00:03:50.070> that<00:03:50.970> had<00:03:51.120> trailers<00:03:51.660> there's<00:03:51.900> Ironhide

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
ones that had trailers there's Ironhide

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.430 
ones that had trailers there's Ironhide
there's<00:03:53.190> Megatron<00:03:53.940> I<00:03:54.209> thought<00:03:54.600> Optimus<00:03:55.080> Prime

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
there's Megatron I thought Optimus Prime

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.830 
there's Megatron I thought Optimus Prime
was<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.890> only<00:03:56.340> legitimate<00:03:56.730> one<00:03:57.060> with<00:03:57.810> a

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
was the only legitimate one with a

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.990 
was the only legitimate one with a
trailer<00:03:58.350> in<00:03:58.770> alt<00:03:58.980> mode<00:03:59.160> obviously<00:03:59.730> because

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
trailer in alt mode obviously because

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.980 
trailer in alt mode obviously because
Optimus<00:04:00.150> Prime

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
Optimus Prime

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.550 
Optimus Prime
always<00:04:01.620> had<00:04:01.800> a<00:04:01.830> trailer<00:04:03.230> Megatron<00:04:04.230> I<00:04:04.260> think

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
always had a trailer Megatron I think

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.390 
always had a trailer Megatron I think
would<00:04:04.680> be<00:04:04.709> ok<00:04:05.100> too

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
would be ok too

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.160 
would be ok too
I'm<00:04:05.820> trying<00:04:06.420> to<00:04:06.480> pick<00:04:06.630> that<00:04:06.750> one<00:04:06.810> up<00:04:07.080> on

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
I'm trying to pick that one up on

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.050 
I'm trying to pick that one up on
clearance<00:04:07.590> Ironhide<00:04:08.160> was<00:04:08.370> kind<00:04:08.730> of<00:04:08.790> a<00:04:08.880> bit<00:04:09.030> of

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
clearance Ironhide was kind of a bit of

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.160 
clearance Ironhide was kind of a bit of
a<00:04:09.120> stretch<00:04:09.390> for<00:04:09.420> me<00:04:09.630> so<00:04:09.870> I<00:04:09.900> didn't<00:04:10.080> bother

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
a stretch for me so I didn't bother

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.780 
a stretch for me so I didn't bother
picking<00:04:10.440> it<00:04:10.709> up<00:04:10.800> so<00:04:11.040> I<00:04:12.800> was<00:04:13.800> able<00:04:14.310> to<00:04:14.340> do<00:04:14.550> it<00:04:14.670> in

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
picking it up so I was able to do it in

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.159 
picking it up so I was able to do it in
practice<00:04:14.970> I<00:04:15.330> don't<00:04:15.510> understand<00:04:15.870> why<00:04:16.020> he<00:04:16.140> can't

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
practice I don't understand why he can't

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.319 
practice I don't understand why he can't
transform<00:04:16.830> him<00:04:16.980> properly<00:04:17.400> when<00:04:17.700> I<00:04:17.730> launch<00:04:18.000> him

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
transform him properly when I launch him

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.820 
transform him properly when I launch him
come<00:04:19.750> on<00:04:20.549> maybe<00:04:21.549> if<00:04:21.729> Alex<00:04:22.210> was<00:04:22.330> reviewing<00:04:22.960> this

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
come on maybe if Alex was reviewing this

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.409 
come on maybe if Alex was reviewing this
particular<00:04:24.220> toy<00:04:24.370> it<00:04:24.580> would<00:04:24.849> work<00:04:25.120> but

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
particular toy it would work but

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:34.890 
particular toy it would work but
whatever<00:04:29.909> anyway<00:04:31.229> I<00:04:32.229> think<00:04:33.069> it's<00:04:33.340> nice<00:04:33.780> it's<00:04:34.780> a

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
whatever anyway I think it's nice it's a

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.149 
whatever anyway I think it's nice it's a
little<00:04:35.229> bit<00:04:35.349> expensive<00:04:37.440> this<00:04:38.440> in<00:04:38.919> the

00:04:39.149 --> 00:04:39.159 
little bit expensive this in the

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:41.159 
little bit expensive this in the
Philippines<00:04:39.550> this<00:04:39.789> one<00:04:40.030> costs<00:04:40.900> about<00:04:41.110> the

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
Philippines this one costs about the

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:46.559 
Philippines this one costs about the
same<00:04:41.379> as<00:04:42.090> a<00:04:43.090> deluxe<00:04:43.389> class<00:04:43.720> figure<00:04:45.330> in<00:04:46.330> some

same as a deluxe class figure in some

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:47.999 
same as a deluxe class figure in some
parts<00:04:46.810> of<00:04:46.900> the<00:04:46.960> world<00:04:47.110> it's<00:04:47.229> probably<00:04:47.500> cheaper

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:48.009 
parts of the world it's probably cheaper

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:49.890 
parts of the world it's probably cheaper
than<00:04:48.280> a<00:04:48.310> deluxe<00:04:48.550> class<00:04:48.729> figure<00:04:49.090> but<00:04:49.240> over<00:04:49.750> here

than a deluxe class figure but over here
in<00:04:50.020> Manila<00:04:50.229> it's<00:04:50.530> about<00:04:50.800> the<00:04:51.069> same<00:04:51.280> as<00:04:51.550> a

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.129 
s so if you have you set your priorities
this<00:04:57.430> was<00:04:57.699> probably<00:04:58.150> be<00:04:58.509> at<00:04:58.629> the<00:04:58.750> bottom<00:04:59.050> of

00:04:59.129 --> 00:04:59.139 
this was probably be at the bottom of

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:02.029 
this was probably be at the bottom of
your<00:04:59.169> list<00:04:59.500> ah<00:05:00.490> there<00:05:01.449> we<00:05:01.569> go

your list ah there we go

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:05.459 
your list ah there we go
