00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:05.520 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.000 

go<00:01:06.520> down<00:01:06.820> well<00:01:07.150> explained<00:01:07.570> that<00:01:08.560> can<00:01:08.740> be<00:01:08.830> very

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
go down well explained that can be very

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.470 
go down well explained that can be very
very<00:01:09.190> useful<00:01:09.310> when<00:01:09.760> you're<00:01:09.850> trying<00:01:09.910> to<00:01:10.150> align

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:10.480 
very useful when you're trying to align

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.090 
very useful when you're trying to align
the<00:01:10.750> song<00:01:10.990> with<00:01:11.230> somebody's<00:01:11.650> voice<00:01:11.800> if

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
they're singing ok so I can transpose it

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.430 
they're singing ok so I can transpose it
when<00:01:15.790> the<00:01:15.910> song<00:01:16.120> is<00:01:16.210> playing<00:01:16.480> or<00:01:17.110> when<00:01:17.290> it's

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
when the song is playing or when it's

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.970 
when the song is playing or when it's
not<00:01:17.940> so<00:01:18.940> anytime<00:01:19.420> the<00:01:20.200> other<00:01:20.320> thing<00:01:20.530> I<00:01:20.560> can<00:01:20.860> do

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:20.980 
not so anytime the other thing I can do

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.610 
not so anytime the other thing I can do
is<00:01:21.010> change<00:01:21.340> the<00:01:21.430> volume<00:01:21.870> with<00:01:22.870> the<00:01:23.020> mixer<00:01:23.350> so<00:01:23.590> I

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 
is change the volume with the mixer so I

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.740 
is change the volume with the mixer so I
can<00:01:23.890> turn<00:01:24.070> that<00:01:24.280> volume<00:01:24.970> down<00:01:25.300> a<00:01:25.360> little<00:01:25.570> bit

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
can turn that volume down a little bit

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.660 
can turn that volume down a little bit
and<00:01:26.470> again<00:01:26.740> I<00:01:26.980> can<00:01:27.130> do<00:01:27.220> that<00:01:27.340> while<00:01:27.520> it's

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
and again I can do that while it's

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.130 
and again I can do that while it's
playing<00:01:28.260> as<00:01:29.260> you<00:01:29.380> can<00:01:29.500> see<00:01:29.650> it's<00:01:29.770> softer<00:01:30.220> and<00:01:31.140> I

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
playing as you can see it's softer and I

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.310 
playing as you can see it's softer and I
can<00:01:32.290> turn<00:01:32.470> it<00:01:32.530> up<00:01:35.730> ok<00:01:36.730> and<00:01:36.940> you'll<00:01:37.930> notice<00:01:38.290> that

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
can turn it up ok and you'll notice that

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.800 
can turn it up ok and you'll notice that
while<00:01:39.160> it<00:01:39.340> was<00:01:39.460> playing<00:01:39.760> when<00:01:40.210> I<00:01:40.270> adjusted<00:01:40.750> the

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
while it was playing when I adjusted the

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.020 
while it was playing when I adjusted the
volume<00:01:41.350> it<00:01:41.800> doesn't<00:01:42.130> remember<00:01:42.430> that<00:01:42.790> for<00:01:43.000> next

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
volume it doesn't remember that for next

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.670 
volume it doesn't remember that for next
time<00:01:43.270> and<00:01:43.660> that's<00:01:43.780> because<00:01:43.990> when<00:01:44.320> you<00:01:44.440> first

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
time and that's because when you first

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.130 
time and that's because when you first
start<00:01:44.950> the<00:01:45.100> song<00:01:45.340> off<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:46.540> might<00:01:46.720> want<00:01:46.900> to<00:01:46.930> pre

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
start the song off you might want to pre

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.170 
start the song off you might want to pre
set<00:01:47.380> the<00:01:47.530> volume<00:01:47.620> control<00:01:48.250> and<00:01:48.430> then<00:01:49.000> if<00:01:49.090> you

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
set the volume control and then if you

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.750 
set the volume control and then if you
change<00:01:49.420> the<00:01:49.600> volume<00:01:49.720> while<00:01:50.050> it's<00:01:50.200> playing<00:01:50.760> you

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
change the volume while it's playing you

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.550 
change the volume while it's playing you
probably<00:01:52.150> don't<00:01:52.420> want<00:01:52.510> that<00:01:52.810> to<00:01:52.990> reflect<00:01:53.380> in

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
probably don't want that to reflect in

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.400 
probably don't want that to reflect in
the<00:01:53.680> music<00:01:54.040> next<00:01:54.220> time<00:01:54.460> you<00:01:54.610> play<00:01:54.820> it<00:01:55.410> so

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
the music next time you play it so

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.530 
the music next time you play it so
remember<00:01:57.250> to<00:01:57.280> change<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:57.760> volume<00:01:57.850> while<00:01:58.420> the

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
remember to change the volume while the

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.300 
remember to change the volume while the
song<00:01:58.690> is<00:01:58.750> not<00:01:59.080> playing<00:01:59.410> to<00:01:59.800> set<00:02:00.010> the<00:02:00.100> initial

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
song is not playing to set the initial

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.580 
song is not playing to set the initial
volume<00:02:00.670> change<00:02:01.570> it<00:02:01.690> while<00:02:01.810> it<00:02:01.930> is<00:02:02.020> playing<00:02:02.290> and

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
volume change it while it is playing and

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.719 
volume change it while it is playing and
there's<00:02:02.770> no<00:02:02.920> effect<00:02:05.010> ok<00:02:06.010> the<00:02:06.520> other<00:02:06.640> thing

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
there's no effect ok the other thing

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.690 
there's no effect ok the other thing
that<00:02:06.880> can<00:02:07.150> be<00:02:07.240> very<00:02:07.450> useful<00:02:07.479> is<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:09.520> might

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
that can be very useful is you might

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.870 
that can be very useful is you might
want<00:02:09.880> to<00:02:09.970> insert<00:02:10.899> tempo<00:02:11.410> changes<00:02:11.950> or<00:02:12.190> key
