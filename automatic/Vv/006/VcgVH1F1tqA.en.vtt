right top of a nice pile of trash yeah
if<00:01:32.310> only<00:01:32.610> weird<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.720> know<00:01:33.900> what<00:01:34.140> do<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.229> think

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
if only weird you know what do you think

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.140 
if only weird you know what do you think
make<00:01:34.560> your<00:01:34.710> point<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.130> mean<00:01:35.430> new<00:01:35.640> parents<00:01:36.090> are

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
make your point I mean new parents are

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.609 
make your point I mean new parents are
always<00:01:36.420> talking<00:01:36.689> about<00:01:36.900> like<00:01:37.140> how<00:01:37.259> fragile

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
always talking about like how fragile

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:38.960 
always talking about like how fragile
they<00:01:37.950> think<00:01:38.189> their<00:01:38.369> kids<00:01:38.610> are<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:38.850> this<00:01:38.909> is

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
they think their kids are and this is

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.090 
they think their kids are and this is
just<00:01:39.270> kind<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.509> an<00:01:39.689> example<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.229> maybe<00:01:40.860> they're

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
just kind of an example of maybe they're

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.830 
just kind of an example of maybe they're
not<00:01:41.250> so<00:01:41.310> fragile<00:01:41.909> after<00:01:42.060> all<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.570> could<00:01:42.630> just

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
not so fragile after all you could just

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.510 
not so fragile after all you could just
you<00:01:43.020> know<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.170> could<00:01:43.530> fall<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.740> little<00:01:43.950> bit<00:01:44.250> not

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
you know I could fall a little bit not

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.940 
you know I could fall a little bit not
out<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.970> building<00:01:45.390> but<00:01:45.630> you're<00:01:46.409> resilient

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
out of the building but you're resilient

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.249 
out of the building but you're resilient
than<00:01:47.009> we<00:01:47.130> think<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.549> think<00:01:47.939> in<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.450> u.s.<00:01:48.630> people

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
than we think I think in the u.s. people

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.499 
than we think I think in the u.s. people
are<00:01:49.680> overly<00:01:50.460> cautious<00:01:50.670> with<00:01:51.090> their<00:01:51.210> kids

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
are overly cautious with their kids

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.880 
are overly cautious with their kids
right<00:01:51.780> they<00:01:51.990> don't<00:01:52.049> want<00:01:52.259> their<00:01:52.380> kids<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.680> ever

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
right they don't want their kids to ever

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.039 
right they don't want their kids to ever
deal<00:01:53.520> with<00:01:53.549> germs<00:01:54.090> but<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.750> mean<00:01:54.899> that

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
deal with germs but I mean that

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.359 
deal with germs but I mean that
obviously<00:01:55.229> helps<00:01:55.799> them<00:01:55.920> build<00:01:56.070> their<00:01:56.280> immune

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
obviously helps them build their immune

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.620 
obviously helps them build their immune
system<00:01:56.969> yeah<00:01:57.600> we<00:01:57.840> definitely<00:01:58.079> baby<00:01:58.890> our<00:01:59.159> kids

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
system yeah we definitely baby our kids

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.249 
system yeah we definitely baby our kids

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
for the story have you narrowly escaped

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.949 
for the story have you narrowly escaped
a<00:02:07.229> dangerous<00:02:07.649> situation<00:02:07.860> Hannah<00:02:08.599> yes<00:02:09.599> I<00:02:09.780> have

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
a dangerous situation Hannah yes I have

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.270 
a dangerous situation Hannah yes I have
I<00:02:10.140> was<00:02:10.289> in<00:02:10.500> Mexico<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.640> we<00:02:11.790> were

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
I was in Mexico and we were

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.860 
I was in Mexico and we were
a<00:02:12.340> catamaran<00:02:12.880> you<00:02:13.090> know<00:02:13.180> it<00:02:13.300> has<00:02:13.420> like<00:02:13.600> the<00:02:13.720> two

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
a catamaran you know it has like the two

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.199 
a catamaran you know it has like the two
floats<00:02:14.230> and<00:02:14.440> we<00:02:15.130> decided<00:02:15.490> that<00:02:15.700> we<00:02:15.850> wanted<00:02:15.970> to

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
floats and we decided that we wanted to

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.030 
floats and we decided that we wanted to
snorkel<00:02:16.840> we<00:02:16.930> were<00:02:17.080> near<00:02:17.290> whales<00:02:17.560> we<00:02:17.800> want<00:02:17.950> to

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
snorkel we were near whales we want to

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.530 
snorkel we were near whales we want to
snorkel<00:02:18.430> with<00:02:18.520> them<00:02:18.670> so<00:02:18.819> we<00:02:18.910> tied<00:02:19.180> a<00:02:19.209> rope

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
snorkel with them so we tied a rope

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.199 
snorkel with them so we tied a rope
between<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:20.260> two<00:02:20.500> floats<00:02:20.920> and<00:02:21.250> all<00:02:21.730> jumped<00:02:22.120> in

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
between the two floats and all jumped in

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.880 
between the two floats and all jumped in
and<00:02:22.360> held<00:02:22.569> on<00:02:22.750> it<00:02:22.930> and<00:02:23.080> then<00:02:23.230> the<00:02:23.350> boat<00:02:23.530> went<00:02:23.770> up

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
and held on it and then the boat went up

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.620 
and held on it and then the boat went up
to<00:02:24.040> like<00:02:24.130> 15<00:02:24.670> miles<00:02:24.910> per<00:02:25.000> hour<00:02:25.120> so<00:02:25.390> we're<00:02:25.480> all

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
to like 15 miles per hour so we're all

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.420 
to like 15 miles per hour so we're all
like<00:02:25.810> dangling<00:02:26.290> and<00:02:26.470> I<00:02:26.890> thought<00:02:27.130> it'd<00:02:27.280> be<00:02:27.310> a

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
like dangling and I thought it'd be a

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.190 
like dangling and I thought it'd be a
really<00:02:27.670> good<00:02:27.819> idea<00:02:27.880> not<00:02:28.330> to<00:02:28.540> hold<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:28.930> looped

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
really good idea not to hold the looped

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.229 
really good idea not to hold the looped
part<00:02:29.500> but<00:02:30.010> to<00:02:30.130> hold<00:02:30.280> the<00:02:30.430> string<00:02:30.790> at<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:30.940> end

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
part but to hold the string at the end

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.600 
part but to hold the string at the end
and<00:02:32.170> then<00:02:32.290> we're<00:02:32.470> going<00:02:32.620> 15<00:02:33.190> miles<00:02:33.370> per<00:02:33.489> hour

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
and then we're going 15 miles per hour

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.449 
and then we're going 15 miles per hour
and<00:02:34.030> I<00:02:34.150> start<00:02:34.420> slipping<00:02:35.050> and<00:02:35.260> I<00:02:36.130> was<00:02:36.340> like

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459
