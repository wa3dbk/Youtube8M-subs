think that's what the reason why i
didn't<00:00:45.930> see<00:00:46.050> anything<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.590> because<00:00:46.710> they

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
didn't see anything is because they

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.160 
didn't see anything is because they
showed<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.340> Jovian<00:00:47.879> complex<00:00:48.420> text<00:00:48.899> instead
