choosing styles for a long face it's

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.960 
choosing styles for a long face it's
important<00:00:24.750> not<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.140> encourage<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:26.400> face<00:00:26.699> to

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
important not to encourage the face to

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.150 
important not to encourage the face to
become<00:00:27.119> even<00:00:27.720> more<00:00:27.750> elongated<00:00:28.380> than<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:29.070> is

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
become even more elongated than it is

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.089 
become even more elongated than it is
already<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:30.420> do<00:00:30.599> this<00:00:30.779> what<00:00:31.080> we<00:00:31.109> work<00:00:31.470> on<00:00:31.740> is

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
already to do this what we work on is

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.400 
already to do this what we work on is
building<00:00:32.520> shape<00:00:33.000> through<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.690> sides<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.230> our

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
building shape through the sides of our

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.270 
building shape through the sides of our
styles<00:00:34.980> for<00:00:35.850> example<00:00:36.920> working<00:00:37.920> with

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
styles for example working with

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.240 
styles for example working with
something<00:00:38.520> that's<00:00:38.730> slightly<00:00:39.660> fuller<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.379> has

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
something that's slightly fuller and has

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.369 
something that's slightly fuller and has
some<00:00:41.489> texture<00:00:41.969> through<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.420> sides<00:00:42.690> will

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
some texture through the sides will

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.220 
some texture through the sides will
encourage<00:00:43.860> width<00:00:44.340> in<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.670> haircut<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.270> give

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
encourage width in the haircut and give

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.979 
encourage width in the haircut and give
the<00:00:46.710> model<00:00:47.100> or<00:00:47.309> yourself<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.300> feeling<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.899> a

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
the model or yourself the feeling of a

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.600 
the model or yourself the feeling of a
little<00:00:49.200> bit<00:00:49.320> more<00:00:49.500> width<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.039> sides<00:00:50.370> of

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
little bit more width to the sides of

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.779 
little bit more width to the sides of
the<00:00:50.700> shape<00:00:51.199> another<00:00:52.199> really<00:00:52.649> great<00:00:52.800> way<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.370> to

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
the shape another really great way is to

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.689 
the shape another really great way is to
perhaps<00:00:53.969> lift<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.050> length<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.469> little<00:00:55.620> bit<00:00:55.890> but

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
perhaps lift the length a little bit but

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.639 
perhaps lift the length a little bit but
bringing<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.210> length<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.840> hair<00:00:58.050> up<00:00:58.230> it

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
bringing the length of the hair up it

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.520 
bringing the length of the hair up it
encourages<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.820> chin<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.449> be<00:01:00.660> reduced

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
encourages the chin to be reduced

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.549 
encourages the chin to be reduced
slightly<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.340> brings<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.300> feeling<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.930> width

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
slightly and brings the feeling of width

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.609 
slightly and brings the feeling of width
back<00:01:05.159> into<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.670> sides<00:01:05.909> of<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.299> shape

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
back into the sides of the shape

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.440 
back into the sides of the shape
therefore<00:01:07.619> encouraging<00:01:08.250> more<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.880> your<00:01:09.030> oval

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
therefore encouraging more of your oval

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.960 
therefore encouraging more of your oval
shape<00:01:09.689> our<00:01:10.260> ideal<00:01:10.799> shape<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.369> we<00:01:11.520> spoke<00:01:11.729> of

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
shape our ideal shape that we spoke of

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.969 
shape our ideal shape that we spoke of
another<00:01:12.720> point<00:01:13.049> when<00:01:13.200> working<00:01:13.439> on<00:01:13.710> long

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
another point when working on long

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.969 
another point when working on long
phases<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:15.600> break<00:01:15.990> up<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.439> length<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.830> the

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
phases is to break up the length of the

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.429 
phases is to break up the length of the
face<00:01:17.189> with<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.820> fringe<00:01:18.210> or<00:01:18.570> some<00:01:18.840> shape<00:01:19.110> through

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
face with a fringe or some shape through

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.859 
face with a fringe or some shape through
the<00:01:19.560> top<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.950> style<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:21.240> by<00:01:21.810> the

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
the top of the style so by the

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.600 
the top of the style so by the
introduction<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.770> something<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.250> cuts

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
introduction of something that cuts

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.600 
introduction of something that cuts
across<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.270> forehead<00:01:24.780> or<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.130> use<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.400> a

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
across the forehead or the use of a

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.920 
across the forehead or the use of a
slightly<00:01:27.470> heavier<00:01:28.470> sweeping<00:01:29.310> fringe<00:01:29.750> what<00:01:30.750> it

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
slightly heavier sweeping fringe what it

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.660 
slightly heavier sweeping fringe what it
will<00:01:31.110> enable<00:01:31.409> is<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:32.040> little<00:01:32.400> bit<00:01:32.520> more

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
will enable is a little bit more

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.520 
will enable is a little bit more
broadness<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.600> top<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.049> shape<00:01:34.290> and

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
broadness in the top of the shape and

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.910 
broadness in the top of the shape and
again<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.939> idea<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.659> eye<00:01:36.689> coming<00:01:37.350> up<00:01:37.619> as

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
again the idea of the eye coming up as

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.640 
again the idea of the eye coming up as
the<00:01:38.159> chin<00:01:38.460> gets<00:01:39.329> reduced<00:01:39.810> in<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.380> front

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
the chin gets reduced in the front

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.190 
the chin gets reduced in the front
length<00:01:40.950> so<00:01:41.549> bringing<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.329> front<00:01:42.540> down<00:01:42.840> and

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
length so bringing the front down and

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.289 
length so bringing the front down and
therefore<00:01:43.829> enabling<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.549> Chim<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:45.000> become

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
therefore enabling the Chim to become

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.870 
therefore enabling the Chim to become
better<00:01:46.049> in<00:01:46.320> balance<00:01:46.770> with<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.100> overall<00:01:47.579> face

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
better in balance with the overall face

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.210 
better in balance with the overall face
shape<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.360> length<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.229> style<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:50.159> the

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
shape and length of the style and the

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.270 
shape and length of the style and the
last<00:01:50.579> point<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.380> encouraging<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.500> hair<00:01:52.710> to

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
last point is encouraging the hair to

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.389 
last point is encouraging the hair to
have<00:01:53.430> movement<00:01:53.899> when<00:01:54.899> hair<00:01:55.200> sits<00:01:55.560> very<00:01:55.860> flat

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
have movement when hair sits very flat

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.480 
have movement when hair sits very flat
and<00:01:56.759> sleek<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.229> sides<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.860> head<00:01:59.040> this

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
and sleek to the sides of the head this

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.060 
and sleek to the sides of the head this
will<00:01:59.700> again<00:02:00.000> encourage<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.780> feeling<00:02:01.229> of<00:02:01.380> slim

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
will again encourage the feeling of slim

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.850 
will again encourage the feeling of slim
or<00:02:02.100> narrowness<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.479> chin<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.049> the

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
or narrowness to the chin and the
