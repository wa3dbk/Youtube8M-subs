00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:07.880
 Good day to all of you Khazars 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:11.630
 and today i don't know maybe it will 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:14.450
 not even very comfortable to say so and video 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:17.029
 maybe who will need it who does not have me 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.839
 personally needed now in my hands 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:23.230
 one of the new adapted laptops 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:26.599
 purely under windows 8 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.390
 can be seen on the button and stood on it 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.189
 windows 8 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:34.760
 I do not remember exactly what the trick is that 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:38.030
 most modern laptops with 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:41.269
 does not have a preinstalled OS 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:46.629
 bottom key stickers from this 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:49.039
 that is, recover the key 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:51.530
 know what key was used on 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:58.190
 evaluation projector in such a case as u 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:01:00.800
 I unreal no personal documents 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:07.060
 to talk about what is the key at all 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:10.160
 was installed on this laptop therefore 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:13.340
 man in general did not want by himself 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.950
 so how would the eight him not 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.680
 liked he did not want to use 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.810
 G8 burned down the same shame 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.540
 Well, as it did not burn , the disk fell down 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:27.200
 maybe baby hit like me 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:30.640
 explained quite standard such 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.530
 I will even touch upon a few 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.860
 topical topics first exactly 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.290
 sony laptops not everyone knows how to log in 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.990
 on it all bios is very simple that is 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:45.850
 The main thing is to turn on the nec laptop with a button 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.850
 power ac buttons assist 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:55.450
 when we enable the assist brackets 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:59.300
 the vario logo is loaded and followed 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:02.690
 treated is said the menu shell 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:05.000
 which is already possible to go into bios well 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:08.599
 there are many features she even 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.370
 Russified during restoration and 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:14.380
 media launch system maintenance 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:20.060
 allow 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:23.630
 all this can be safely done launch 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.090
 windows is now inserted in this laptop 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.060
 drive with windows nt how a person lived 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.780
 all the same windows and it was more convenient for him 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.460
 he has a seven on his computer 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.200
 laptop became the eight he did not 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:40.069
 used only for what it was 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:44.120
 as if the license is installed but since 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:47.140
 hard kill it's time 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.900
 meet the creator 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.630
 he asked to put the seven 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:56.180
 most people switch themselves to 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.130
 seven as they are not satisfied at all 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.850
 windows interface itself 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.640
 allose 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.790
 a lot of what is not comfortable plus it is not 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.020
 compatibility with many programs 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:10.130
 incompatibility with many one 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:13.850
 programs glitches for example with some 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:16.370
 versions of sony vegas with photoshop but many 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:20.270
 many many different nuances that people 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.670
 not satisfied enrages secondly windows 8 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:26.470
 was adapted to 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:29.480
 Still, the sensor is screen 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.260
 for tablets for mobile phones 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:38.270
 therefore often any movement on 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:42.230
 the touchpad it recognizes as i don't even know 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:44.720
 like there are some commands and because 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:48.110
 it caused discomfort in people 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.740
 rabies and so forth now how 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.740
 i see 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.489
 I run it does not issue a cycle your boobs and 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.940
 a pirate on system is in vivo 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:02.819
 that is, from the diet I system with this 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.840
 the disc does not fit say why 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:08.640
 what is standing here 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:16.139
 yu.f. Now I'll tell you exactly where 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:20.570
 spent and do not apologize, too, will not go 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:20.570
 start again buttons assist 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:49.890
 I press f2 and here in the section but there is such 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:57.170
 option 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:57.170
 as you can see whether events should th e iu 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:07.320
 This is an option to load OSes only 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:09.570
 windows 8 to 8 on new with windows 8 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.530
 went it started to specifically put on 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.550
 these laptops 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.750
 how to give him a measure so that people could not 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.670
 install windows 7 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:21.440
 so often when they address me 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:24.540
 people wanting accustomed windows 7 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.940
 they tried to set themselves in 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:31.230
 They could not do anything because they did not know about 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:33.780
 This is how I just tried 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.380
 came in with but saw here saw 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:38.400
 simply 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:40.130
 This option when clicked on the legacy 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.280
 what does legacy mean 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:46.620
 just cut that legacy function 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.569
 we activate the download feature 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.189
 old operating systems 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:52.949
 that is, even expression is possible 

00:05:50.189 --> 00:06:01.699
 put you message 4 gigabytes 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:06:04.860
 RAM now push sex 

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:05.909
 from now we can boot 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:10.110
 windows 8 

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:15.959
 I calmly Belarusian screech also 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:18.509
 among ck new as you can see loading went 

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:24.029
 I did not even enter the disc 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:26.249
 which of the devices we take or tin 

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:28.740
 should start first it started 

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:30.560
 launched north because on 6 shadows 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:33.960
 It was 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:36.410
 but a file that says that 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:39.810
 need to load windows 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:43.860
 but basically if you are people who know 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:48.720
 then you know how to do it all that 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:53.480
 I wanted to tell the principle on this all 

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:53.480
 good luck with you and see you
