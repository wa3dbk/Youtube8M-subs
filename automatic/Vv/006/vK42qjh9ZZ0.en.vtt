00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.259
 for guys other languages ​​and if I'm 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.789
 here I have come back here less temporarily 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:09.040
 had to go back to Coruña to have a 

00:00:06.789 --> 00:00:10.120
 series of personal commitments 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.990
 so done today's purchase 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.910
 Buyers until down do not confuse with 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.640
 horizon cerocahui it seems that one is 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.080
 very lost very lost this game is not 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.670
 the one of war since it was confirmed the 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.920
 last of three left us already has a lot 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:27.460
 time their backs initially 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:30.310
 raised for ps3 and move but due 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.259
 in quotes to fail to move then and 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.480
 others gain their development despite 4 nov a 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.920
 joint decision of sony and supermassive 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.310
 game that are responsible for their 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.310
 developing 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.269
 well I this game already knows really 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:46.809
 saber in the latest edition of madrid 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:48.730
 game week that review I did 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.140
 a positive but incomplete experience 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.930
 because incomplete good because let's say 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.699
 that the circumstances of the stand that 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.540
 it showed that game were not the right ones 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:59.060
 OK 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.010
 it was not a closed stand these are 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.720
 open passes through hatreds there do not you 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.420
 whole you do not hear anything 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.920
 brutal ruckus and this game so in 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.930
 others 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.490
 the whole sound theme important both 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.320
 for the dialogues because narratively 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.360
 is a game that a very narrative burden 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.130
 intense and also for that touch 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.240
 tell it to the best we receive it that is 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.460
 he passed the strange sounds whispers what 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.979
 that is already the sound theme is fundamental 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.200
 and I think that this game would be 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.509
 better seen because it is not so closed a 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.369
 cabin does not matter to me and that the people who 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.320
 Try is in the game and 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.150
 completely oblivious to what happens in the 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.700
 outside of another way then the 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.590
 experience is incomplete fact 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.850
 fact is culture anecdote of that dante 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.040
 also and a girl not a girl 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.300
 young girl who came and I think she was 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.580
 four minutes so the game came 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.740
 to the average such inspired and who said I do not know 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.869
 but hey he's here here is here only 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.090
 speaks not play here nothing happens here I 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.970
 I ask for what it is not a game 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.800
 for everyone and on top I insist 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.810
 circumstances since its presentation 9 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.750
 your stand all the perfect for tasting 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.170
 which I liked what I saw 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.780
 it was incomplete 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.849
 It's a school game by Harry Reid 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.649
 and john your soul is what happens 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.500
 it seems more like people in the sense that 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.720
 it demands more from you at playable level indeed 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.660
 there are many characters that put us 8 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.670
 friends - if not loose it's worth 8 characters 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.620
 8 can die or can survive 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.330
 depends on what we do depends on 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.640
 our decisions with what then 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.540
 I insist playfully I demand a little 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.190
 more is not an interactive movie 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.040
 terms hate or how many people are 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.350
 Endeavor to say good so good 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.880
 come on let's go to open it let's go to this 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.590
 It is the limited edition with metal box 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.510
 I think there's nothing else the truth I 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.620
 I went to buy what he called at mid-sea 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:50.220
 I even know nothing and it cost me 59 99 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.900
 euros 60 euros 10 less than in game by 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.940
 to give an example with which I insist 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.060
 will call to buy like this from estrangis 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.650
 is really good and good data well 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.710
 interesting and I can comment 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:05.590
 installation of at least 40 physics 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:08.470
 and finally itself also compatible with the 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:12.610
 crisis are cameral let's say the game 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.170
 can capture our our face to the 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.270
 moments of more tension plus fear and 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.740
 we have scared and also one thing 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.020
 pretty stupid of what can be 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.300
 curious funny is not essential to 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.190
 play of course and also compatible 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.510
 accurately move before I told you that 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.880
 initially be in a game thought 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.130
 for ps move about everything but because of 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.770
 good between meals in the failure of 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.840
 then they decided to pass the ps4 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.000
 it's not that I say it, it 's an interview 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.890
 that I have read in sending the team 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.780
 responsible for the game and basically that 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.920
 argument that they said that because 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.890
 There is a lot here between the 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:48.550
 users as a and decided together together 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:51.400
 your team pass the development to ps 4 the 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.620
 benefits that entails goes well 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.390
 Well let's go to open it I insist not 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.130
 There is much more to say here their 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.600
 decisions will have who survive what 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.670
 that was said before with a lot of friends 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.170
 about the cabin where they disappeared 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.360
 two of his classmates things do not 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.830
 It will also take an ugly time with the 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.420
 line of attention taking over the 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.830
 members of the group you must put yourself in the 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.990
 skin of each of them to 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.120
 survive until dawn when your 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.920
 commissions and observe how the 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.579
 course of the story with the effect 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.239
 perfect fine butterfly before before 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.440
 you forget me 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:25.270
 next to this game I have caught another one 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.930
 launch that surely happened very 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.050
 unnoticed 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.780
 risen 3 titan north to present the 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.950
 edit chances 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.400
 good sometimes thanks very well loses 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:38.139
 I lost a lot, do not hold on to gothic 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.500
 in short I on her several times I 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:43.540
 I understand that it is not to everyone's taste 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.160
 but I get lost and piranha bytes to stone 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.460
 and vice versa the responsible team the 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:51.639
 real gothic team not like 24 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:54.070
 arcania I am some uncles that adornment that 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:55.360
 I love so this game going up so 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.070
 I had caught when I found out it was 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.720
 an improved version for me that 4 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.270
 Because I said, well, I'm waiting for her 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.190
 for 35 euros also in half markt 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.810
 so if you really like playing 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.330
 this one of this genre that I bought 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.540
 interesting and I would almost say unknown if 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.610
 you want in three appointments north there is or you have 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.129
 ok we're going to open it you do not know 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.860
 until down 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:19.679
 and well I'm going to stream to the 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.990
 six in the afternoon Spanish time is worth yes 

00:05:19.679 --> 00:05:24.060
 the evening Spanish time 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.350
 let's go to this video you will surely see it 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.840
 uploaded because I believe that 3 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:30.390
 late maybe a little later 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.570
 new today depends on youtube and depends 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:35.889
 of my connection is always good 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:38.949
 unexpected things can happen 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:40.810
 and well basically I say so that the 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:43.060
 people from other time zones with others 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.969
 sets with different schedules 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:48.189
 so I can calculate more or less that 

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:51.120
 well I think that in three hours 

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:54.099
 more or less then the streaming would start 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:56.020
 within three hours or so to 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:57.340
 all the rest of the Spanish territory and 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.289
 Well, I 'm telling you now, there's the 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:02.330
 late I have I plan to start the 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:04.670
 streaming this game according 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:10.000
 all right 

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:13.900
 the mythical plastic that by the way is 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.280
 very tight to the box not like other times 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.590
 Y 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:20.230
 in code colones as it is for the code 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.790
 of bonus I do not know that this code 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:24.340
 to bring something interesting that does not 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:26.770
 I want you to see bastards I do not know what 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:29.160
 what it brings me, it's the same 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:33.580
 well this has nothing nothing at all 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:36.540
 disco the interesting silkscreen of a 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:40.410
 scheme with very basic controls 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:42.800
 and little more a little more nothing else nothing 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:42.800
 plus 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:49.490
 good as good good to say something 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.170
 is that the price of this box edition 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.180
 metal is exactly the same as the 

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:56.240
 normal edition with which it is also not 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:57.800
 that is an aberrant thing but it is already 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.870
 a limited edition pussy as it combines 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:03.040
 some postcards or so not stickers and 

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:04.720
 the talent is something like that 

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.480
 well here you see a kind of crack 

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:10.150
 on the box and embossed with 

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:12.730
 an interesting interesting crack 

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:15.790
 interesting then if before ours 

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:17.230
 they have called it ok they have surprised me already 

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:19.240
 to say goodbye there are people that when 

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.890
 saw this game when I posted it for 

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.570
 twitter said ah pussy but it has already gone to 

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:25.120
 The sale has already gone on sale 

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:26.470
 I do not know why you are so surprised by me 

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.540
 made the departure date of departure of 

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:30.880

 always the immoral milonga mirna count 

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:35.350
 they are also not caught by surprise I do not know 

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:36.700
 what are you means for 

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:38.620
