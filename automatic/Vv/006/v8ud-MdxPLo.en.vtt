 very simple installation is common with 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.590
 any other program done that 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.430

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:41.070
 connect the USB cable to the 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:43.300
 your device did it there ready 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.220
 program will recognize the device 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.290
 soon the program will recognize my 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.930
 device that was the 730 and 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.080
 apply device in case of my nokia 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.630
 lumia 800 I already downloaded before I already did 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.720
 installing windows phone 8.1 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.100
 appears here is to install and 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.750
 click install here I'll need 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.000
 do nothing just leave the cellphone 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.000
 connected it's cute to click install 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.440
 that the program does everything for you I do not 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.880
 I will stay here because I just click on 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.100
 install it begins the process of 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.260
 and I 'll be all mine. 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.489
 applications already organized everything here I 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.120
 I will not do it 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:22.360
 it's the whole secret ok the device is only 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.220
 recognize in a program is often 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.230
 right now I had to restart the 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.120
 device in order to recognize the 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.100
 program was not recognizing 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.290
 Taking time here was stuck. 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.030
 so I had to restart the 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.890
 device here to recognize 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.170
 so often times you have to 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.600
 start the computer or restart the computer 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.680
 device 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.720
