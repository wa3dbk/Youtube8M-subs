think sometimes that's the way is when
you<00:02:42.420> have<00:02:42.540> no<00:02:42.630> expectation<00:02:42.959> for<00:02:43.530> 20<00:02:43.830> had<00:02:44.010> the

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
pay for it later there's a lot of steep

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.789 
pay for it later there's a lot of steep
hills<00:04:20.299> later<00:04:20.630> on<00:04:20.780> it's<00:04:21.260> only<00:04:21.380> a<00:04:21.470> thousand

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
hills later on it's only a thousand

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.320 
hills later on it's only a thousand
meters<00:04:21.890> is<00:04:22.160> as<00:04:22.250> high<00:04:22.370> as<00:04:22.400> this<00:04:22.580> gets<00:04:22.880> but

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
meters is as high as this gets but

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.300 
meters is as high as this gets but
you're<00:04:24.050> up<00:04:24.170> and<00:04:24.320> down<00:04:24.380> up<00:04:24.650> and<00:04:24.800> down<00:04:24.860> a<00:04:25.070> lot<00:04:25.220> of

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
you're up and down up and down a lot of

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.190 
you're up and down up and down a lot of
climbing<00:04:25.490> on<00:04:25.700> second<00:04:25.970> half<00:04:26.150> that's<00:04:26.420> -<00:04:26.720> yeah

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
climbing on second half that's - yeah

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.560 
climbing on second half that's - yeah
and<00:04:27.470> quite<00:04:28.310> a<00:04:28.340> lot<00:04:28.460> of<00:04:28.580> steps<00:04:28.820> which<00:04:29.120> are<00:04:29.390> you

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
and quite a lot of steps which are you

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:30.940 
and quite a lot of steps which are you
saying<00:04:29.900> earlier<00:04:29.990> a<00:04:30.260> lot<00:04:30.380> of<00:04:30.500> runners<00:04:30.650> are<00:04:30.860> not

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
saying earlier a lot of runners are not

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.650 
saying earlier a lot of runners are not
so<00:04:31.100> used<00:04:31.280> to<00:04:31.370> the<00:04:31.520> steps<00:04:31.820> there<00:04:32.120> the<00:04:32.210> steps<00:04:32.450> up

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
so used to the steps there the steps up

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.260 
so used to the steps there the steps up
and<00:04:32.690> down<00:04:33.020> I<00:04:33.800> guess<00:04:34.040> it's<00:04:34.220> just<00:04:34.280> a<00:04:34.580> different

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
and down I guess it's just a different

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.930 
and down I guess it's just a different
kind<00:04:35.680> of<00:04:36.680> different<00:04:36.920> motions<00:04:39.760> well<00:04:40.760> if<00:04:40.850> the

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
kind of different motions well if the

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.330 
kind of different motions well if the
climbing<00:04:41.300> and<00:04:41.390> the<00:04:41.570> descending<00:04:42.050> yeah<00:04:42.800> yeah

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
climbing and the descending yeah yeah

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.650 
climbing and the descending yeah yeah
this<00:04:43.550> is<00:04:43.700> standing<00:04:43.940> on<00:04:44.000> the<00:04:44.060> steps<00:04:44.390> if<00:04:44.630> you

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
this is standing on the steps if you

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.380 
this is standing on the steps if you
yeah<00:04:45.290> she's<00:04:45.830> not<00:04:46.040> fast<00:04:46.280> downhill<00:04:46.550> on<00:04:46.790> steps<00:04:47.180> in

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
yeah she's not fast downhill on steps in

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.930 
yeah she's not fast downhill on steps in
