some<00:02:13.340> walnuts

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.900

bit of goji berry and these are pretty

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.980 
bit of goji berry and these are pretty
sticky<00:02:27.400> so<00:02:27.550> you'll<00:02:27.880> probably<00:02:28.150> need<00:02:28.420> a<00:02:28.480> fork<00:02:28.930> to

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
sticky so you'll probably need a fork to

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.050 
sticky so you'll probably need a fork to
get<00:02:29.290> them<00:02:29.470> out<00:02:29.650> before<00:02:32.340> we<00:02:33.340> put<00:02:33.700> in<00:02:33.850> our

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
the top and we like to put our protein

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.110 
the top and we like to put our protein
powder<00:03:59.750> in<00:04:00.069> after<00:04:01.069> we've<00:04:01.220> already<00:04:01.459> blended<00:04:01.850> it

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
throw in our scoop of protein powder and

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.340 
throw in our scoop of protein powder and
again<00:04:12.860> i'm<00:04:12.980> also<00:04:13.130> going<00:04:13.400> to<00:04:13.490> throw<00:04:13.760> in<00:04:14.350> three
