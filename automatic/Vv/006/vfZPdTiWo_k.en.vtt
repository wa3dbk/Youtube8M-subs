00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:19.019
Salutations celestial sight seers! I'm David
Fuller, welcome to Eyes on the Sky; what's

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.150
up this week?

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.029
Check out this sequence of moon phases that
will be visible over the next 7 days, as the

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.809
moon moves from a thin crescent, past first
quarter, and on to a waxing gibbous phase

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:35.020
by the weekend. Notice anything? Watch again,
but look down here at the southern tip of

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.510
the Moon... what happens? Because of a number
of factors -- including the tilt of it's orbit,

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.489
that fact that its orbit is elliptical, and
that observers aren't viewing the Moon from

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.109
the center of the Earth -- we see something
called libration. This is a rocking of the

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:53.889
Moon's appearance to observers on Earth over
time, allowing us to peek around the poles

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:59.319
and eastern and western edges and see up to
59% of the lunar surface.

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:04.159
We've looked at many of the northern features
in the past such as Mare Crisium, Hercules

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.909
and Atlas, so instead let's head to the southern,
more cratered part of the Moon for some fantastic,

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:15.950
deeply-shadowed areas. Look for Hommel, a
multi-cratered area right along the shadowed

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.370
terminator on Monday evening. This crater
is named for Johann Hommel, a 16-th century

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:27.750
German mathematician and astronomer, who was
a teacher of Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.040
The crater is one of the larger ones on the
Moon, at 125 kilometers across, but the oblique

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.340
angle from which we see it causes it to appear
somewhat slimmer than large ones we view more

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.110
face-on. The shadows on this day accentuate
not only this crater, but the one immediately

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.210
adjacent to its north, Pitiscus, named for
another German mathematician who was a contemporary

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.890
of Brahe. An evening later these craters are
still quite prominent. And on Tuesday, look

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:01.130
for the 90 to 100 kilometers across craters
of Theophilus, Cyrillus and Catharina. With

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.240
central mountain peaks and interior craters,
they are easy to find and well worth the view

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:13.170
at higher magnification. Use most any small
telescope at 75 to 100 times or greater magnification

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.129
for fantastic views.

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:21.870
Dark Sky Fact: How often do you wake up tired
in the morning? Other than not getting to

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.069
bed early enough and other easily changed
habits like consuming caffeine or alcohol

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.510
too close to bedtime, an issue that may be
causing poor sleep is too much of the wrong

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:37.510
kind of light before going to bed. Learn more
at this website: sleepinthedark.com.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.299
On Wednesday the depth of Pitiscus is evident
from the still-shadowed eastern wall of the

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:49.469
crater, but along the terminator, more fascinating
views abound. The large and complex walled

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:55.959
plains of Maurolycus to the east, and Stofler
immediately to it's west are quite the highlights

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:02.959
to observe. Clocking in at 114 and 137 kilometers
in diameter respectively, Stofler is perhaps

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:08.920
the more intriguing one as it has a floor
flooded with lava. Look for this a day or

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.999
more later; the darker floor should make this
crater stand out slightly from nearby ones.

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:18.709
On the 5-th, the Moon is at first quarter
phase and the Lunar X will be visible (see

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.569
EOTS.com), but the next evening brings another
incredible appearing features on the Moon:

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.569
The Straight Wall.

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:30.310
On the eastern side of Mare Nubium, this lunar
fault is a section where the lunar surface

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:37.310
is slumped on the western side by some 250
to 300 meters in height. However, despite

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:42.309
the "cliff-like" look of this feature, it
is more accurately a gentle slope of just

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:49.249
7 degrees or so. The steep angle of a rising
Sun on the Moon's surface provides the steep-shadowed

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:54.040
look, but that's just an illusion from our
perspective. In the 17-th century the Dutch

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:00.459
astronomer Christian Huygens likened the straight
wall and curved feature to its south as appearing

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:05.650
like a sword. Some still refer to this area
as "Huygen's Sword," although the Straight

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.699
Wall's official name is the latinized "Rupes
Recta."

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:13.559
Under the right lighting conditions, Rupes
Recta appears to be surrounded by a nearly

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:19.019
circular region within Mare Nubium. Sometimes
referred to as "Ancient Thebit," which is

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.150
an unofficial name, it is likely the result
of a previous impact that the lava has flooded

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.050
over. Still, it is a somewhat intriguing areas
to peruse and consider the forces at work

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:35.970
which created the wonderful view we have today.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.530
That's all for this week. Keep your eyes on
the sky and your outdoor lights aimed down,

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:44.600
so we can all see, what's up. I'm David Fuller,
wishing you clear and dark skies.
