00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:10.790
 let's make a delicious recipe 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.800
 I always tell them that in the morning when 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.990
 go to their jobs when they go to 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.910
 drive or take the truck or take the pc 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.400
 ero or get on the subway you need your 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.900
 brain needs sugar and good 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.930
 what do you think if he will show you the 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.670
 recipe the ingredients are some strawberries 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.440
 that are not expensive right now 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.830
 starting the heat are I bought them at 10 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.840
 pesos a bag is very cheap amaranth 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.790
 that as you know the amaranth has a 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.489
 jet of amino acids and it's also 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.710
 Protein a little honey can be honey 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.600
 of bees or honey of maguey also and 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.400
 cocoa this product can get 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.230
 in all markets in Mexico go 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.850
 with the lord or the lady of chilies and 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.620
 they ask you to get them if you do not 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.300
 they have at that time what they think 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.739
 we first grab the strawberries that the 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:58.100
 disinfect very well if you disinfected 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:00.710
 first with everything and its stem offered and 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.899
 then I take it off because if I leave them like this 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.070
 already without the stem will begin to absorb 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:09.280
 all the water with disinfectant 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.140
 then we cut so easy I'm going to 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.500
 use more or less about five or six 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.420
 delicious strawberries if they do not have strawberry and 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.310
 says chef johnny why are you 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.110
 making strawberries really 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.160
 are very expensive we can also use a 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:26.229
 apple or a pear that have quite 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:30.850
 fiber concentration very well and 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:33.460
 Amaranth companies I will help 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.800
 The less hands we show when we 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.560
 We work with products that we are going to 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:42.509
 consume them raw much better 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:46.840
 hygiene issues and a little honey 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:49.119
 and the delicious remember the honey always 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.700
 that they use honey for example when 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.020
 make a tea the miguel has to be or 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.300
 the tea has to be at 40 degrees 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.860
 centigrade more than that at temperature 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.380
 warm by more sun temperature 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:03.070
 nature environment and a little cocoa 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:06.420
 look at this precious cocoa as they are 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.429
 the grains like seven cocoa beans 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.380
 that cocoa helps regulate 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.830
 estrogen in women and it's also 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.650
 super protein very well we put a little 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.410
 of water we will go regulating the amount 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.989
 of water almost like a glass and to put 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.150
 work the blender lady always 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.770
 I recommend the smoothies is very because 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.380
 how did they see if they have all the 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.260
 ingredients to the strawberry disinfected and 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.390
 all the ingredients packed in your 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.130
 Cupboard is not going to take more than 3 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.670
 minutes in preparing a smoothie and 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.860
 take it filtered and then you can inside 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.130
 two hours back to breakfast 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.700
 this is delicious to put a little more 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.700
 power 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.200
 and so as we already have it we are going to use the 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:58.140
 same glass if they want to not have to 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:02.609
 mess up pure water and do not know 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:05.219
 how delicious is all this is pure life 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:09.209
 What we can do is replace 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:10.859
 times well what a nice super color what 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.140
 we can do is replace the amaranth 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:13.890
 for oatmeal amaranth and oats what 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.260
 can get in any 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.170
 supermarket or in the market is also 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.540
 very cheap this is a protein shake 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.120
 that will give them the necessary sugar in 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.620
 the morning directly from a fruit and 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.680
 the sugar also that will provide us 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.560
 in this case our carbohydrate 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.970
 our cereal so good I hope that 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.209
 like this liquefied made from 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.209
 the heart
