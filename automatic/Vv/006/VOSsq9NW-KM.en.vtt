00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.370
 broadcast live Sunday edition 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.410
 America accepted unsuccessful periods of life 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.470
 call black so here's the departing week 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.220
 turned black for american 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.380
 agricultural producers prices for meat 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.720
 products collapsed immediately after entering 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.340
 Russian response to American 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.689
 sanctions especially suffered 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.570
 American chicken producer 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.849
 which now seems like a million 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.859
 their profits from deliveries to Russia legs 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.170
 bush anxiety in major american 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.480
 corporations such as boeing here 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.309
 rushing off-schedule to buy Russian 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.100
 titanium for the construction of aircraft 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.899
 and then suddenly what business is it states 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.090
 It requires explanation from the White House and 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.550
 the answer hears the revelations of jen psaki and 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.649
 Marie Harf State Department Representatives 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.600
 clearly having very remote 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.230
 ideas about the intricacies of the world 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.210
 of the economy 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.199
 Report of our American Sobkor 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.239
 Valentin Bogdanov at the State Department Speaker 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.309
 Mari Harf is not always good with 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.600
 world politics agriculture 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.700
 not her horse 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.010
 when russia responded to american 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.340
 sanctions urgently needed not to go 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.020
 got the moment we study 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.850
 this solution is how it 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.100
 reflect on us business but for example 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.780
 undoubtedly adversely affect itself 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.670
 We believe that the Russian economy 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.020
 one possible scenario would be growth 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.759
 already high inflation 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.770
 undermining purchasing power 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.180
 Russian citizens so if these 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.130
 sanctions were intended to 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.829
 somehow harm us they hurt more 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.509
 Russia about Europeans damage which the United States 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.549
 actually and pulled into a joint 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.100
 sanction hike harp delicately 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.439
 Keep silent about the logic of Washington 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.079
 restrictions against the EU is even 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.149
 not bad with them a common market 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.860
 one step closer to the free zone 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.140
 trade across the atlantic 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.990
 but what's on the other side of it 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.390
 freedom those who trade themselves understand 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.640
 quite differently Russia is not going to 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.409
 surrender in this new cold war and 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.479
 it can also hurt financial 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.430
 interests of the other side that's why 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.350
 United States Chamber of Commerce and National 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.360
 association of industrialists the two most 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.220
 big lobbying groups you bought 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.709
 pages of the largest newspapers in the us 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.110
 place a call to lift sanctions bye 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.850
 in the white house congress are read 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.080
 make sense and maybe think better 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.440
 manufacturers of the same American 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.860
 chickens will forget those 306 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.320
 millions of dollars that came out in 2013 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.480
 on the export of bush legs to Russia figures 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.510
 this year will stop on indicators 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.790
 beginning of August is no longer 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.030
 there will be a knife and bush name at all 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.160

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.750
 American chicken seems the most 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.400
 long-lived long gone to rest 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.040

 giants 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.120
 well russell seeing the news behind 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.280
 worried about how global 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.709
 economy is in the know now every farmer 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.110
 if you hit hard on its foundation 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.690
 cracks will run all over the building 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.790
 was elected we will lose business growth 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.650
 stop so limit the amount 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.090
 the fact that we can sell though than 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.130
 more we can sell to people for 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.290
 outside the country the better the market is now 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.580
 and so is not very stable 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.310
 condition 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.590
 the alarm bell sounded lightning fast 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.750
 thursday cattle prices and 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.780

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.700
 washington post paints a picture 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.100
 last year's well-being almost all 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.570
 American positions 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.860
 agricultural exports 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.770
 Russian sanctions to multiply the former 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.870
 revenue at zero and m project effect from 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.340
 Santa for farmers exporting their 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.020
 products to Russia will be 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.450
 immediate because just 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.950
 now the farmer sows what 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.990
 they planned to export 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.640
 if they can't really leave their 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.080

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.660
 sell your products 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.240
 semi fresh look that sanctions touch and 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.370
 now not only rural 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:20.010
 American weapons dealers 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.930

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.860
 hit the stop list of American Treasury 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:32.010
 Kalashnikov with his worldwide popularity 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.910
 in markets but will the company or 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.950
 double you si 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:38.040
 now it only remains to sell off 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.750
 later warehouse we deeply regret 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.360
 about current circumstances but we must 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.940
 obey us laws worry and 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.190
 much bigger business in the airline 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.470
 united puzzle where in case 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.320
 ban on flights to redirect profitable 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.700
 in terms of fuel economy 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.770
 transsiberian routes and this with 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.620
 that the question is how to fly though not immediately 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.020
 can be replaced by questions than titanium 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.419
 for the modern aviation industry such 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.040
 same winged metal cafe aluminum from it 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:07.919
 for example, make landing gear 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.740
 Boeing Russia in this market is the main 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:12.810
 supplier third of world volume since March 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.480
 months at the Boeing factory actively 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:18.150
 stockpiled for the future accumulated enough for 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.710
 8 months and what's next possible 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.540
 impact of the Ukrainian crisis on 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.460
 titanium supply chain even more 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.740
 complicated by the fact that Ukraine 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.390
 supplies almost all enrichment product 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.430
 ores necessary for spring 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.380
 pure titanium production bye 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.690
 supplies of titanium from Ukraine to Russia are not 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.240
 interrupted amid the worldwide alarms 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.940
 the scale is lost those that are smaller and that 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.620
 such losses Californian pistachios 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.780
 comparing billions in losses 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.500
 European farmers or headache 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.360
 Boeing but American nuts in Russia 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.560
 now also banned for a hundred 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.440
 seventy three million dollars 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.300
 their export is reduced by one advertisement 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.300
 pistachio trading engine 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:59.330
 do not restart real pistachio 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:03.160
 Now she as a policy if separated 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:06.080
 the excess shell we get a pure nutlet 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:08.630
 it would be great to write this down but 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.580
 booze these nuts with the help of Ukrainian 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:14.450
 crisis staged a test of strength 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:16.250
 all world security and here's why 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.030
 all this should lead what is the final 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.070
 result 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.900
 let's imagine that sanctions are fine 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.760
 work and what the Russians will eventually say 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.890
 seize Ukraine do what you want 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.430
 put your rockets right by our 

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:28.250
 the border 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:30.890
 take Ukraine in nato ah sanctions kill 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:33.140
 we are not, of course, mean sanctions will be all 

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.940
 stronger and stronger all that sanctions do 

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.530
 they create even more hatred and 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.960
 more problems of economic and 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:41.210
 geopolitical sanctions oppose 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.370
 the peace process but who is not in the united 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:45.650
 states does not speak of NATO and not least 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:47.480
 give talk about him even you he during 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.950
