00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:15.240
 sometimes when you have this car then the 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.220
 truth is that I bought it the other day 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.050
 in a gameplay that I recorded but good and 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.630
 you will see it soon I will upload the one that 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.460
 claim blake the gameplay in about two or 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.990
 three days I guess so you'll see the 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.090
 why do I have this loop of 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.279
 four by the way I love the case today 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.470
 we are here a very interesting video and 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.969
 too much I would say I do not know how to these 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.770
 heights can still keep coming 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.290
 mysteries to create after the 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.079
 game have already already going in search of the two 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.950
 añitos yosoyuxi elgeta 5 already looking for 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.170
 two years old because in September 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.000
 It is two years old but good the case 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.590
 after a year or so since there 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.329
 be the game for they are still found 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.309
 mystery that good is not very 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.840
 surprising because I think 10 20 years 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.129
 later sunshine against mystery not 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.390
 but good once a bit like that 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.190
 There are 5 that are played by so many people 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.440
 because this kind of games which are 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.399
 find mysteries after so much 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.449
 time that only the game then the 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.579
 game that was not so many people 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.690
 but for example the gta 5 with all the 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.070
 people who are going to play and all the people who 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.390
 them first and all the people who are 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.740
 looking day by day 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.140
 it's kind of weird that they follow 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.350
 finding but good is a mystery 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.810
 very very very cool that neither that in 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.670
 something incredible but you will see that 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.810
 it is a reference a reference 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.550
 quite amazing when I'm dialing 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.290
 here the car pretty well perfect the 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.830
 case I come to teach a reference to 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.650
 a possible tsunami in the saints and 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.450
 you know that the map of gt5 for all the 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.700
 city is called the saints and nothing 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.440
 Well, you know that he has always 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.640
 been the rumor this that in the 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.410
 old to have a tsunami that they were going to 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.899
 put a tsunami dlc has been found 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.670
 files in the Sudan game and there is a 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.320
 interest a magazine and saw 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.200
 does a tsunami time amount and 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.820
 there is enough to be the rumors of 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.020
 that maybe one day some goal 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.149
 kind of animation some kind of 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.979
 efe or something which is a tsunami in the 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.750
 city ​​and that all flood the most makes 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.210
 when you leave enough time for gta 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.410
 Christmas because it was if I remember correctly 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:05.039
 because for Christmas people this year not 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:07.140
 last year, obviously, a 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:10.590
 sort of mode for consoles in which 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.120
 Well, you could see the city ​​of 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.720
 saints with a city and if so how is it 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.130
 listening 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.110
 you can see everything flooded everything full of 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.430
 water obviously they are as much as if 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.720
 the city ​​outside a pool basically 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:24.960
 it's all pretty new 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.810
 so to say I do not know how to say it a new 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:31.320
 shows that it corroborates that good 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.690
 yes that rockstar leaves as small leave 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.670
 as small clues that doing so 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.590
 reference to a possible tsunami in the 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.180
 city ​​of the saints so good then I 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.710
 they will say and break and I will go down and half 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.840
 thousands of hours talking about the city 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.400
 nonsense and will teach us the mystery 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.170
 Gothic had already taught calm and 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.640
 simply what you have to do is 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.840
 come right here to this hairdresser 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.010
 It's worth here in the city of losantos 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.410
 you know that there are different hairdressers 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.420
 Well, you have to come to this 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.709
 barrier that is here basically the in 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.390
 the center the city ​​of saints more or 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.400
 least a little bit in the north just 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.660
 here in this hairdresser you come in three 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.160
 obviously if there is a gentleman here in the 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.230
 door smoking policeman part sir 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.280
 please I want a is by the door 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.570
 of the hotel and then the people of this 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.580
 city the balance that has quite 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.410
 little is worth and now we enter the 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.450
 hairdressing and gob is to be here the 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.940
 miss this good morning 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.940
 Well, look at us, we get in here 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.069
 the deepest of the hairdresser and eye 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.129
 the eye louse we take the mobile 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.930
 we take the camera and look very good 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:28.110
 in this picture that we have just 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.150
 here at the top and that is this 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.000
 guys actually how are you watching 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.950
 in the city of saints totally 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.209
 flooded as you see right in this 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.800
 area of ​​the image right here in the 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.799
 bottom right you can not see anything 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.900
 but in the middle part of those 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.940
 white lines that white line jaua ya 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.230
 this is water but confirmed I do not know 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.849
 yes with the quality of the capturing 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.989
 although good for quite some time 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:50.910
 time I'm analyzing the videos to the 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.410
 maximum quality that can be 1080p 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.849
 then I guess it's supposed that if 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.500
 You put it to the maximum so you can see the 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:56.579
 picture much better but they see and I 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.650
 I recommend that you come to these 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.030
 properties from your gt5 and you can 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.160
 appreciate pretty well that you officiate that 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.989
 that's water , it looks like everything 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.220
 is flooding little by little and you see there 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.599
 like there's a giant water layer 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.810
 which is covering all the buildings 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:12.480
 pretty cool and as you can see I do not know 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.700
 here is put this first 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.620
 help and you can not see very well what 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.199
 who comes to do is hello 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.609
 in the photo but the fact is that it is 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:24.060
 pretty cool this type ministry 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:26.220
 doing I'm going to see if I can remove 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.810
 I do not know if you can get out here in the 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.040
 I try guns shooting yes 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.000
 outside he could put the weapons in here 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.040
 something like that I hope your moment 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.669
 if I charge the dependent employee 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.860
 come on until later and now I can not give 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.330
 the closed hairdresser you put me good 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.650
 Good places that I can not catch 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.760
 here inside weapons to remove to create 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.220
 a shotgun for example the thing is 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.360
 throwing the inside of having a good time being that 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.520
 although I can have a grenade from 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.590
 out to see if I like to see the 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.729
 Uncle whole image but it gives me that 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:55.330
 that's going to be impossible to see 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:59.310
 to try to pick up a grenade and throw it away 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.310
 right there's my mother or perfect 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.500
 to see I did not move but more until the 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.300
 little ones the little ones stand up for 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:11.690
 try to hope for kid 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.610
 wait for me to give me what I can 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.129
 remove that from there up or maybe 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.599
 rockstar the position exclusively for 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:19.310
 that it can not be removed I do not know I do not 

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:21.950
 I have no idea 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.310
 boy it perfect to see if the is 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.080
 remove 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.180
 it does not stay as stuck boy does not 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.250
 you can remove that you can not take them 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:34.140
 life we ​​will keep trying the 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:37.150
 version to the old bell that could not 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:41.770
 enter shot from the whole to wing 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:43.150
 removes door to door that does not remove the 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.550
 door 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:49.440
 basically I want to teach the truth is 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:51.970
 that the whole image to see if I get it 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:55.960
 to see nothing here I try to try 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:57.490
 do not look at me 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.350
 I want to remove and be able to see the image 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.840
 whole even though he knew that being attached to 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:05.020
 what if he can not be I do not know I know not 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.610
 I can take off my makeup and this 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.690
 now wench turning a blind eye there 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.730
 one for example positive comments 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.890
 another all this leave me your nuts 

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:15.700
 your our theories as well 

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:16.930
 say it and see if I do not know if you tell me 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.450
 something interesting and some theory 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.950
 interesting let's get in there we're not going to 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:22.770
 leave so that the door prevents us from 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:24.599
 shot of the grenade 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.810
 let's put ourselves right here in the 

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:30.230
 limit of the door 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:33.750
 and let's see what I try to do 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:35.860
 put there I think that from this angle 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:38.490
 a little more 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.740
 we throw 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:43.229
 if we remove equitable I am impossible 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:45.660
 well not because I here say goodbye with the 

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:47.840
 little photo this comes out as a kind of 

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.840
 crack 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.419
 so a cellar madly suits him that 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:54.210
 all this at the same time is something quite 

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:56.520
 interesting the photo is designed so 

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:59.599
 I hope they put a misery in the cane and 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.599
 takes advantage of favorites 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:23.460
