00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.360
 so eccentric Flemish team 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.800
 ball raised in the area 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.429
 the vessel within the small area 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:12.029
 did not succeed yet we managed 

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:15.029
 the line-up show made the crossing 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.720
 the official results 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.720
 the athletic-pr technician 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.420
 political power 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.860
 everything should follow 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.350
 more than 400 vehicles 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.380
 exactly with me 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.540
 this site wikipedia 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.540
 a team presents itself in this question 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.310
 the single travel tax - the collection of the use of cortisone 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.189
 dispatch of the minister entering marking of the léo moura was deriving athirson 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.820
 because according to the producer himself 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.820
 but coming to the Portuguese hit the corner 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.280
 montezemolo 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.240
 in the first half 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.689
 the Portuguese beto marden netherlands in the second half did not slow down and 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.500
 in a nice little newspapers play inside tied everything in paulino maracanã is a 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.270
 player who has good power of completion to five of the guarani and thus was of the saints 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.069
 so who does not have where steps 9 shirt made goal 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.569
 alternated based on the work of the technical onion I believe that the created play 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.569
 on the right inside the area with no artifice 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:18.609
 caprichou at the crossroads the ball comes to lift the 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.569
 the decision 

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:37.289
 it's a normal game 

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:40.289
 today is a pearl 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:49.689
 many complain 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:51.199
 Portuguese in front 

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:53.799
 since the beginning of the second half the Portuguese has been characterized 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:58.149
 exactly as physical effort with more footprint in the marking the maximum 

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:07.849
 on the left is west 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:11.169
 sought the bottom line and the Flemish arrived at the intersection of the streets
