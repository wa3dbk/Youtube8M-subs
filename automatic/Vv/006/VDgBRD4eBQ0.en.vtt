00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.780 
and the last part is that one that
one's<00:03:28.110> probably<00:03:28.769> going<00:03:29.190> to<00:03:29.250> take<00:03:29.430> like<00:03:29.730> half

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
one's probably going to take like half

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 
that flower in a little bit actually

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:39.350 
that flower in a little bit actually
they're<00:04:37.270> like<00:04:37.419> candy<00:04:37.840> pop<00:04:38.020> buds<00:04:38.349> or<00:04:38.680> something

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
they're like candy pop buds or something

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.089

yeah<00:04:40.360> you<00:04:40.419> throw<00:04:40.870> Pikmin<00:04:41.289> inside<00:04:41.650> and<00:04:41.949> they

00:04:42.089 --> 00:04:42.099 
yeah you throw Pikmin inside and they

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:45.450 
yeah you throw Pikmin inside and they
become<00:04:42.970> I<00:04:43.419> think<00:04:44.110> it<00:04:44.380> actually<00:04:44.590> kills<00:04:45.099> your

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
become I think it actually kills your

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.120 
become I think it actually kills your
Pikmin<00:04:45.750> but<00:04:46.750> then<00:04:46.870> spits<00:04:47.169> out<00:04:47.320> a<00:04:47.380> seed<00:04:47.740> of<00:04:47.979> the

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
Pikmin but then spits out a seed of the

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.760 
Pikmin but then spits out a seed of the
same<00:04:48.340> color<00:04:48.930> so<00:04:49.930> basically<00:04:50.260> just<00:04:50.380> allows<00:04:50.650> you

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
same color so basically just allows you

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.850 
same color so basically just allows you
to<00:04:50.860> convert<00:04:51.190> your<00:04:51.340> picked<00:04:51.610> into<00:04:51.820> other<00:04:51.970> colors

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
to convert your picked into other colors

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.339 
to convert your picked into other colors
it's<00:04:53.860> quite<00:04:54.010> useful<00:04:54.419> not<00:04:55.419> so<00:04:55.690> useful<00:04:55.900> in<00:04:56.199> this
