00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.740
 hello mages was and the audience today 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.830
 will do 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:11.090
 times all scientists and we will use three 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.030
 the kind of stuffing the first stuffing is mine 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:17.520
 potatoes and onions 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:20.670
 ordinary boiled his potatoes peeled 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.519
 understood and fried onions and here 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:29.760
 It turned out such a value the second filling 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:35.270
 this is me green onion and egg and third 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:40.739
 the filling will be carrots and it's a little bit 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:43.260
 stop on green onions where do u 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:47.460
 I have a small bed now I'm right here 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.390
 all to this all these me remain in 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.300
 I transplanted top parsley with 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:56.520
 surrender and here it is with the fall does not grow and 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.270
 Now I took the bow 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.719
 It is seen that there still remain those that have 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.290
 I am fresh until young and I will plant 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.880
 him 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.790
 for and for this I literally soak 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.030
 there is about two for three here 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:17.909
 a small ray that I have left and 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.549
 plant it quickly and quickly germinate 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:27.299
 but the only thing I need to say is to soak 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:29.000
 and always I have green onions which 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.220
 can add there anywhere and 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.689
 parsley friends parsley is also constantly 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.520
 so we think rather this is mine 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.850
 first year such a grief. 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.450
 you tried to plant 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:50.700
 dill but for some reason it does not grow first 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:56.720
 kind of going to do in such a triangle for 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:59.700
 this roll out the dough about the test I 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:04.439
 I can credit this dough universally 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:10.050
 and showing how to do it, I use 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:16.160
 there is always here we take a plate 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:21.510
 so here's a circle 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:25.100
 middle we put our stuffing this time 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:29.489
 this is me potatoes with onions 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:33.980
 do not need much about a tablespoon 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:38.610
 so here we start from this edge 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:40.650
 we pinch down to about the middle and now 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:46.380
 take this edge and latch on this one 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:49.040
 the side and this side is this 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.040
 that's fast 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.180
 triangle 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:07.680
 and continue like that triangles 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:10.849
 ready to quickly send them 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.930
 the oven preheated the oven when 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:16.680
 temperature of 180 degrees will drink 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:22.310
 next thing 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:34.250
 what kind and we will do the same 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:38.430
 cut out our circle let's go stuffed one 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:44.370
 a tablespoon can be a little bit more 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:53.299
 add and do it differently 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:53.299
 we start like this 5 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.940
 everything 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:11.459
 This form is also easy to remove. 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:15.250
 excess flour and and such a pie 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:16.829
 continue the third kind of stuffing this 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:21.180
 carrot 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:22.819
 we don't wash it into pieces and let it go 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:27.270
 there 

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:28.039
 face learn from us get carrots 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.240
 heart 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:37.740
 also a tasty filling 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:40.520
 not everyone likes these pies too 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.520
 roll out 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:05:01.530
 breaks do differently is put 

00:04:52.879 --> 00:05:08.300
 one half of the second filling 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:08.300
 we cover it with a half so we pinch it 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 and then we start doing like dumplings 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.000
 such a pattern 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:49.180
 looks like this and keep the ball 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:54.680
 so here a year sorry already ready to pies 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:58.940
 triangles look like this with these 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:01.190
 which are the last kind so and which 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.560
 in the middle looks like this sheva 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:07.820
 practically didn't talk about dough 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:18.490
 asks to look aerial but more often 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:21.700
 dough and here's the phenomenon so everyone 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:24.980
 Have a nice appetit. Thank you for your attention. 

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:28.090
 thank you for being with me such a head 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.090
