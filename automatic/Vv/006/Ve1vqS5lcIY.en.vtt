00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
this one it's not too bad I think the

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.810 
this one it's not too bad I think the
acog<00:02:18.430> on<00:02:18.580> the<00:02:18.640> dragunov<00:02:19.060> is<00:02:20.100> in<00:02:21.100> fact<00:02:21.340> a<00:02:21.550> little

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
acog on the dragunov is in fact a little

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.550 
acog on the dragunov is in fact a little
bit<00:02:21.940> harder<00:02:22.330> than<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.959> regular<00:02:23.170> scope

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
bit harder than the regular scope

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.600 
bit harder than the regular scope
because<00:02:24.450> almost<00:02:25.450> so<00:02:25.630> find<00:02:26.020> that<00:02:26.350> the<00:02:26.860> but<00:02:27.100> the

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
because almost so find that the but the

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:28.860 
because almost so find that the but the
bullets<00:02:27.940> like<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.209> curve<00:02:28.420> around<00:02:28.600> the

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
bullets like the curve around the

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.890 
bullets like the curve around the
enemies<00:02:29.170> I<00:02:29.760> don't<00:02:30.760> know<00:02:30.850> why<00:02:31.060> I'm<00:02:31.420> not<00:02:31.540> sure<00:02:31.780> if

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
enemies I don't know why I'm not sure if

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.860 
enemies I don't know why I'm not sure if
it<00:02:32.019> shows<00:02:32.200> up<00:02:32.350> in<00:02:32.470> these<00:02:32.680> in<00:02:33.130> this<00:02:33.640> game<00:02:33.880> but<00:02:34.060> if

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
it shows up in these in this game but if

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.590 
it shows up in these in this game but if
I<00:02:35.080> could<00:02:35.140> get<00:02:35.500> them<00:02:35.620> and<00:02:35.800> I<00:02:35.860> can<00:02:36.040> find<00:02:36.280> them<00:02:36.430> all

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
I could get them and I can find them all

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.120 
I could get them and I can find them all
yeah<00:02:37.600> give<00:02:38.080> some<00:02:38.290> examples<00:02:38.769> cuz<00:02:38.950> sometimes

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
yeah give some examples cuz sometimes

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.560 
yeah give some examples cuz sometimes
the<00:02:39.400> bullets<00:02:39.700> just<00:02:39.760> go<00:02:39.970> straight<00:02:40.239> through<00:02:40.450> the

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
the bullets just go straight through the

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.160 
the bullets just go straight through the
enemies<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.920> mp9<00:02:42.220> it's<00:02:42.550> not<00:02:42.700> too<00:02:42.880> bad<00:02:43.170> there's

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
enemies the mp9 it's not too bad there's

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.630 
enemies the mp9 it's not too bad there's
nothing<00:02:44.290> wrong<00:02:44.560> to<00:02:44.739> love<00:02:44.890> you<00:02:45.070> and<00:02:45.459> that

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
nothing wrong to love you and that

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.060 
nothing wrong to love you and that
there's<00:02:45.910> no<00:02:46.090> lag<00:02:46.420> in<00:02:46.690> this<00:02:46.840> Lobby<00:02:47.230> there<00:02:47.920> might

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
there's no lag in this Lobby there might

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.390 
there's no lag in this Lobby there might
be<00:02:48.100> a<00:02:48.220> little<00:02:48.370> bit<00:02:48.580> but<00:02:49.800> that's<00:02:50.800> not<00:02:51.130> the

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
be a little bit but that's not the

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.729 
be a little bit but that's not the
reason<00:02:52.150> for<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:52.570> bullets<00:02:52.930> decided<00:02:53.500> to<00:02:53.620> go

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
reason for the bullets decided to go

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.020 
reason for the bullets decided to go
straight<00:02:53.980> through<00:02:54.220> I'm<00:02:54.310> not<00:02:54.459> too<00:02:54.580> sure<00:02:54.760> maybe

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
straight through I'm not too sure maybe

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.840 
straight through I'm not too sure maybe
I<00:02:55.650> think<00:02:56.650> it's<00:02:56.769> just<00:02:56.920> to<00:02:57.010> do<00:02:57.160> with<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:57.519> way<00:02:57.670> the

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
I think it's just to do with the way the

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.280 
I think it's just to do with the way the
ACOG<00:02:58.180> lines<00:02:58.420> up<00:02:59.370> but<00:03:00.370> yeah<00:03:00.850> i'm<00:03:01.630> also<00:03:01.780> open<00:03:01.959> to

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
little bit of an added challenge make it

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.899 
little bit of an added challenge make it
a<00:05:40.740> little<00:05:40.860> bit<00:05:41.039> harder<00:05:42.560> so<00:05:43.560> yeah<00:05:43.919> if<00:05:44.279> you<00:05:44.759> have
