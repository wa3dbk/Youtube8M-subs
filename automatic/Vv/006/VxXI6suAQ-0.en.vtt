00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 and is that for these kids here 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.710
 welcome once again to the channel and I'm 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.780
 with a play of minecraft we are here in 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.780
 11 from the agro map 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:20.060
 and let's see if we capture a desire or 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:22.189
 something I do not know anything this jungle very little like that 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.020
 that's fine, yes, although the notice cut 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:27.020
 because the next golden potatoes suit and 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:30.439
 does not achieve bars at least in this video and 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.480
 that your rather long modern map does not 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.480
 last as long as possible later I go to 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:40.760
 continuation of the jungle beat blog 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:44.240
 ctw and let's go here hop let's go for 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:47.570
 it would be that bridge 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:50.300
 it seems that here is to make a bridge 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.460
 well, that 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.520
 and well now we are going to do something 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:59.000
 let's go around here around here 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.890
 around here around here over here 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.449
 I'm 1.7 as you see I do not have his 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:09.360
 pack for that good 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:11.730
 I'm more worried about stole how it's going 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.520
 but put break this breaks this me 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:17.190
 worries gringo bases because they are not 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.410
 sprint more I like where it explains that 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.110
 those who have 1.7 do not delay 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:25.050
 quite this I think it's going to make a 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.150
 very extreme rush so I take two wool 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:31.170
 we put here I will also continue 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:35.060
 because not what to leave more 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:39.310
 complicated since they are here changing 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.310
 no no no no no no no it 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.340
 we are going to kill 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.700
 catch 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:52.490
 so give me a casualty not there 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.350
 populated I hope this number says them 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.830
 I'm saying good I hope this one 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.720
 do not steal my wool seriously, no no no 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.030

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:06.960
 fighting please 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:11.060
 apart from that I'm recording and that 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.060
 the base is a very extreme clasp 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.630
 I propose that I put it here is something used 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.630
 with this 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:22.140
 I tell them that there are no blues 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:29.410
 fields before me you can not steal me 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:34.650

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.650

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:46.430
