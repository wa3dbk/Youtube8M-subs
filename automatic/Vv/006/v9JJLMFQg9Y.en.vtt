00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.290 
front you can take out as much or as
little<00:02:40.590> as<00:02:40.920> you<00:02:41.040> want<00:02:41.069> if<00:02:41.489> you<00:02:41.610> want<00:02:41.880> if<00:02:42.120> you

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
little as you want if you want if you

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.970 
little as you want if you want if you
have<00:02:42.420> longer<00:02:42.690> bangs<00:02:43.020> that<00:02:43.380> will<00:02:43.500> blend<00:02:43.739> better

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
have longer bangs that will blend better

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.650 
have longer bangs that will blend better
with<00:02:44.160> this<00:02:44.520> I<00:02:44.730> would<00:02:44.880> suggest<00:02:45.030> taking<00:02:45.390> out

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
with this I would suggest taking out

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.610 
with this I would suggest taking out
more<00:02:46.160> just<00:02:47.160> to<00:02:47.340> have<00:02:47.459> it<00:02:47.489> blend<00:02:47.790> better<00:02:48.380> but<00:02:49.380> my

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
more just to have it blend better but my

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.470 
more just to have it blend better but my
hair<00:02:49.860> is<00:02:49.890> very<00:02:50.310> thin<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:50.700> short<00:02:51.120> in<00:02:51.269> the<00:02:51.330> front

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
hair is very thin and short in the front

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.030 
hair is very thin and short in the front
so<00:02:51.720> I<00:02:51.750> just<00:02:51.959> take<00:02:52.110> out<00:02:52.320> about<00:02:52.560> two<00:02:52.709> inches

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
so I just take out about two inches

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.340 
so I just take out about two inches
should<00:02:53.250> be<00:02:53.430> good<00:02:53.700> enough<00:02:53.910> so<00:02:54.900> let's<00:02:55.080> go<00:02:55.230> ahead

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
should be good enough so let's go ahead

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:07.520 
should be good enough so let's go ahead
and<00:02:55.500> try<00:02:55.950> her<00:02:56.130> on

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.380 

and<00:03:08.530> she<00:03:08.770> seems<00:03:09.100> a<00:03:09.370> little<00:03:09.820> bit<00:03:09.940> tight<00:03:10.210> at

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
and she seems a little bit tight at

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.410 
and she seems a little bit tight at
first<00:03:10.630> sometimes<00:03:11.440> what<00:03:11.950> I<00:03:11.980> do<00:03:12.070> is<00:03:12.250> I<00:03:12.760> don't<00:03:13.120> use

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
first sometimes what I do is I don't use

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.300 
first sometimes what I do is I don't use
the<00:03:13.690> front<00:03:13.990> comb<00:03:14.230> just<00:03:14.620> so<00:03:14.740> it's<00:03:14.860> not<00:03:15.010> pulling

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
the front comb just so it's not pulling

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.840 
the front comb just so it's not pulling

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.770 
can just put in the sides of the front
comb<00:03:20.890> and<00:03:21.100> not<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.430> middle<00:03:21.730> which<00:03:22.450> is<00:03:22.480> what

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
not too thick it's the perfect length I

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.120 
not too thick it's the perfect length I
would<00:03:59.860> say<00:04:00.070> it's<00:04:00.220> about<00:04:01.530> 16<00:04:02.530> inches<00:04:02.560> with<00:04:03.070> a

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
would say it's about 16 inches with a

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.800 
would say it's about 16 inches with a
little<00:04:03.430> bit<00:04:03.520> of<00:04:03.640> layers<00:04:03.850> you<00:04:04.180> can<00:04:04.210> I'll
