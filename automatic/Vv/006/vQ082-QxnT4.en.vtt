00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.520

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.650
 to change colors what will help them 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.630

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.880
 of course changing colors like 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.680
 they could be characters like evil goku or 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.560
 any other suit that does not come out in the 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.750
 game I 'm sorry to do this tutorial with 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.239
 you loquendo but the truth I do not like 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.430
 my voice or good not recorded not only I come 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.559
 to apologize so let's start 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.320
 first the tool that I use is the 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.510
 photoshop cs3 portable if you ask me 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.450
 why I use that version is because I do not 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.670
 like the new ones we will first start 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.950
 inserting its texture in the photoshop 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.870
 at first they may be lost but 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.449
 it's just a matter of knowing well how it is 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.309
 your character I'm going to create efe that is 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.350
 the son of freezer in the manga dragon 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.050
 ball do this texture I asked for a 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.239
 friend so I 'll do it with pleasure 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.129
 already being in photoshop we will go to the 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.380
 next tool which is keep 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.960
 selection tool which serves to not 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.670
 get out of areas besides filling in already 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.659
 selected the area we click on 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.659
 right and fill 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.770
 we will get this window and we will click 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.770
 in using and then in color 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.920
 here they will give us the option of what tone and 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.170
 color we use 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.850
 but I will look for what tone can be left 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.360
 I did what I want is for it to be 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.360
 similar 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.829
 and it is best to use first 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.829
 soft light 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.670
 if the color does not change much at the moment 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.470
 of using soft light means that the color 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.150
 it's too strong and in that case 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.150
 we will have to use linear light 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.180
 and you will see that the color changed without 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.250
 will damage the details of the texture as 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.530
 the shadows or clothing brands in some 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.790
 cases not like with the brush that ruins 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.790
 most of the time 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:32.960
 I will continue to give this texture a little 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.210
 Meanwhile, pause the video 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.580
 then all that's left is to index the image 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.530
 we continue to go to image then to 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.150
 color and finally indexed from there 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.520
 will ask us if we want to combine 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.850
 layers and we will give you that if you verify that 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.840
 do not pass 256 colors and we will go back to 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.840
 put it in color rgb 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.819
 and smart friends we have finally finished 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.160

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.950
