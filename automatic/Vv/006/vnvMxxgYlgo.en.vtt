so<00:00:01.920> an<00:00:02.639> F<00:00:02.939> minor<00:00:03.360> seven<00:00:03.870> chord<00:00:03.980> looks<00:00:04.980> like

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
so an F minor seven chord looks like

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.250 
so an F minor seven chord looks like
this<00:00:05.930> this<00:00:06.930> is<00:00:06.990> the<00:00:07.610> minor<00:00:08.610> seventh<00:00:09.120> and<00:00:09.300> the

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
this this is the minor seventh and the

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.100 
this this is the minor seventh and the
minor<00:00:10.469> third<00:00:10.940> if<00:00:11.940> you<00:00:12.389> remember<00:00:12.719> from<00:00:12.929> my

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
minor third if you remember from my

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.690 
minor third if you remember from my
method<00:00:13.530> what<00:00:14.070> you're<00:00:14.190> going<00:00:14.309> to<00:00:14.340> do<00:00:14.490> is<00:00:14.610> you're

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
method what you're going to do is you're

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.340 
method what you're going to do is you're
going<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:14.849> find<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.150> root<00:00:15.299> of<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.480> chord<00:00:15.780> then

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
going to find the root of the chord then

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.670 
going to find the root of the chord then
the<00:00:16.740> note<00:00:16.920> of<00:00:17.039> fourth<00:00:17.250> above<00:00:17.580> it<00:00:18.380> from<00:00:19.380> there

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
the note of fourth above it from there

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.790 
the note of fourth above it from there
if<00:00:20.130> it's<00:00:21.119> a<00:00:21.270> major<00:00:21.480> seventh<00:00:21.930> chord<00:00:21.960> you<00:00:22.590> take

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
if it's a major seventh chord you take

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.800 
if it's a major seventh chord you take
the<00:00:22.920> top<00:00:23.130> two<00:00:23.310> notes<00:00:23.550> down<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:24.060> half<00:00:24.330> step<00:00:24.510> each

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
the top two notes down a half step each

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.700 
the top two notes down a half step each
so<00:00:25.710> this<00:00:25.859> would<00:00:26.039> be<00:00:26.130> F<00:00:26.400> major<00:00:26.910> seven<00:00:27.449> but<00:00:28.349> we're

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
so this would be F major seven but we're

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.650 
so this would be F major seven but we're
going<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:29.039> be<00:00:29.130> finding<00:00:29.490> F<00:00:29.699> minor<00:00:30.029> seven<00:00:30.449> so

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
going to be finding F minor seven so

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.979 
going to be finding F minor seven so
from<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.960> starting<00:00:31.289> position<00:00:31.710> F<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.489> b-flat

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
from the starting position F and b-flat

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.110 
from the starting position F and b-flat
take<00:00:33.989> both<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.530> these<00:00:34.770> notes<00:00:35.040> down<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.790> half

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
take both of these notes down to half

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.119 
take both of these notes down to half
steps<00:00:36.450> each<00:00:37.100> to<00:00:38.100> there<00:00:38.690> this<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.930> F<00:00:40.170> minor

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
steps each to there this is F minor

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.389 
steps each to there this is F minor
seven<00:00:42.649> let's<00:00:43.649> do<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.829> same<00:00:44.040> thing<00:00:44.250> with<00:00:44.370> B

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
seven let's do the same thing with B

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.790 
seven let's do the same thing with B
flat<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:45.180> starting<00:00:45.750> position<00:00:45.840> would<00:00:46.200> be<00:00:46.230> B<00:00:46.530> flat

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
flat a starting position would be B flat

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.209 
flat a starting position would be B flat
and<00:00:47.039> E<00:00:47.460> flat<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:48.680> then<00:00:49.680> if<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:49.860> take<00:00:50.039> these

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
and E flat and then if you take these

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.100 
and E flat and then if you take these
two<00:00:50.280> notes<00:00:50.700> down<00:00:51.559> to<00:00:52.559> half<00:00:52.860> steps<00:00:53.190> each<00:00:53.930> we<00:00:54.930> get

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
two notes down to half steps each we get

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.029 
two notes down to half steps each we get
B<00:00:55.860> flat<00:00:56.129> minor<00:00:56.309> seven<00:00:56.820> like<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.890> so<00:00:58.890> let's

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
B flat minor seven like that so let's

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.819 
B flat minor seven like that so let's
play<00:00:59.250> F<00:00:59.489> minor<00:00:59.879> seven

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.470 

now<00:01:03.219> b-flat

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:24.280 

now<00:01:16.250> this<00:01:16.400> is<00:01:16.580> a<00:01:16.760> flat<00:01:18.310> dominant<00:01:20.920> so<00:01:22.960> to<00:01:23.960> find<00:01:24.200> a

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
now this is a flat dominant so to find a

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.170 
now this is a flat dominant so to find a
dominant<00:01:24.710> chord<00:01:24.920> start<00:01:25.520> with<00:01:25.640> the<00:01:25.729> root<00:01:25.940> and

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
dominant chord start with the root and

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.660 
dominant chord start with the root and
then<00:01:26.479> a<00:01:26.510> fourth<00:01:26.869> and<00:01:27.320> you<00:01:27.830> take<00:01:28.040> the<00:01:28.190> top<00:01:28.400> note

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
then a fourth and you take the top note

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.940 
then a fourth and you take the top note
down<00:01:29.150> a<00:01:29.509> half<00:01:29.810> step<00:01:29.990> which<00:01:30.470> is<00:01:30.650> the<00:01:30.770> major

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
down a half step which is the major

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.020 
down a half step which is the major
third<00:01:31.310> and<00:01:31.659> you<00:01:32.659> take<00:01:32.869> the<00:01:32.990> middle<00:01:33.140> note<00:01:33.380> down

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
third and you take the middle note down

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.320 
third and you take the middle note down
two<00:01:35.030> half<00:01:35.270> steps<00:01:35.479> which<00:01:36.110> is<00:01:36.229> the<00:01:36.350> minor<00:01:36.560> third

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
two half steps which is the minor third

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.460 
two half steps which is the minor third
so<00:01:38.330> this<00:01:38.450> is<00:01:38.659> e<00:01:38.840> flat<00:01:39.409> dominant<00:01:41.140> if<00:01:42.140> we<00:01:42.350> took

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
so this is e flat dominant if we took

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.830 
so this is e flat dominant if we took
them<00:01:42.680> both<00:01:42.830> down<00:01:43.210> this<00:01:44.210> would<00:01:44.390> have<00:01:44.509> been<00:01:44.600> a

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
them both down this would have been a

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.359 
them both down this would have been a
flat<00:01:45.229> minor<00:01:45.649> 7<00:01:47.140> but<00:01:48.140> in<00:01:48.229> this<00:01:48.320> case<00:01:48.530> let's<00:01:49.039> play

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
flat minor 7 but in this case let's play

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:55.029 
flat minor 7 but in this case let's play
dominant<00:01:50.000> so<00:01:50.590> this<00:01:51.590> one<00:01:51.800> and<00:01:52.009> this<00:01:52.550> one<00:01:54.039> here

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
dominant so this one and this one here

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:05.320 
dominant so this one and this one here
go<00:01:55.160> back<00:01:55.340> to<00:01:55.490> the<00:01:55.550> beginning<00:02:00.520> ok<00:02:01.550> so<00:02:02.710> f<00:02:03.710> minor<00:02:04.039> 7

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330
