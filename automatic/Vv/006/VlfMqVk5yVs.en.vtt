00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.849
 from the first day of exploring this 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.010
 car is still the first generation I 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.910
 I thought that nothing more universal 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.309
 for our roads 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.039
 never done i was wrong 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.910
 first came the second generation then 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.150
 3 it is now 4 4 subaru generation 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.150
 forester 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.720
 what is so interesting forester our 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.850
 Drivers comfort and dynamics 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.280
 handling that is the best features 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.300
 passenger car five-door body 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.120
 wagon 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.140
 as well as permanent all-wheel drive 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.690
 impressive ground clearance and 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.290
 high landing driver that is the best 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.800
 features 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.989
 SUV fashion trends are such that 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.610
 modern crossovers from generation to 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.789
 generation lose their off-road 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.649
 forester quality is another thing 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.289
 compared with the predecessor clearance 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.250
 increased by 5 millimeters and now it's 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.329
 22 centimeters note that only a few 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.880
 these frame SUVs 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.250
 this indicator is more understandable that 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.350
 compared with the third forester om 4 became 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.390
 higher wider and longer and yet 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.670
 continuity of generations in design on 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.439
 face you easily recognize it 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.930
 foresta and suv already through 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.240
 few seconds notice that outdoor 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.280
 mirrors are now not on racks but on the doors 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.229
 they also had a triangular window 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.130
 This is done in order to improve 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.229
 visibility 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.390
 Well, why do the doors now close 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.930
 the threshold you probably already guessed for 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.549
 to keep these doorstep clean 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.829
 forester is still offered and with 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.150
 aspirated from a turbocharged engine but 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.430
 outside these versions 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.710
 already so easy you can not distinguish corporate 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.930
 air intake on the hood of the turbo 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.380
 forester is no longer for the best 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.840
 aerodynamics fuel economy base 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.630
 two-liter engine gasoline oppozitnik 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.430
 as before, and in it 150 horsepower 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.829
 but now he's on the whole half a second 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.630
 accelerates the car faster 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.270
 the cherished first hundred on the speedometer 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.070
 plus another nice bonus now 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.320
 forester u for every 100 kilometers 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.390
 need half a liter of gasoline less than 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.879
 predecessor in absolute numbers 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.780
 8 liters of petrol per hundred kilometers to 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.569
 combined cycle 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.730
 by the way more powerful motors available for 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.540
 New Forester also began to eat less 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.880
 gasoline 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.160
 combined cycle consumption they now do not 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.110
 exceeds 8 and a half liters per 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.440
 two and a half atmospheric engine 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.540
 liters of 172 horsepower but and in the most 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.080
 powerful two-liter turbo engine 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.420
 the Japanese harness nehily herd 240 cars 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.760
 horses with such an engine maximum 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.739
 speed exceeds 220 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.260
 kilometers an hour with the first hundred 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.260
 the car is picking up for a half seconds 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.280
 truly pleased this salon 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.590
 car while most 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.540
 automakers declare their 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.880
 claims on the status of premium brands 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.970
 fur coat mouth just makes comfortable and cozy 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.190
 Forester interiors are not pretentious 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.110
 there is no wood or an abundance of chromium 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.360
 but at the same time it creates a feeling 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.340
 almost homely not in 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.470
 last thing thanks carefully 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.420
 thoughtful ergonomics by the way 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.730
 compared to its predecessor front 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.950
 the chairs here are set higher by whole 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.040
 35 millimeters from here and the best 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.540
 visibility and a greater sense of confidence 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.370
 rear passengers got whole 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.350
 twelve centimeters extra 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.660
 career spaces and it feels 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.600
 and if you wish, you can also fold 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.640
 forester backrest has grown and 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.820
 the trunk has become bigger too 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.940
 as much as 505 liters but the main thing is that now 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.440
 the back door opens and closes 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.690
 motorized opening height itself 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.610
 can program it come in handy 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.580
 for example in a garage with a low ceiling 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.140
 except the most basic version 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.490
 six-step mechanics all forester 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.560
 and now come to us with 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.270
 transmission called long a 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.910
 tronic is a variator 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:03.010
 but two versions are provided in one of 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.360
 them and this was on our test 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.700
 downshift 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.680
 the variant without a ponzayka is equipped 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.660
 paddle shifters to 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.280
 right from the steering wheel could be switched 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.140
 conditional gear 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.060
 if the forester is not bought 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.670
 exclusively for the urban jungle and 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.859
 trips to forests and fields and to 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:25.510
 mountains, then my choice is obvious 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:27.340
 version with downshift but all 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.280
 without exception version with variator 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.230
 equipped with xmod system what is this x 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.419
 such a job he takes when 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.910
 pressing the button near the variator selector 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:39.120
 one click and the forester turns into 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.830
 real rogue 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.290
 in this mode, driving up a steep slope 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.510
 you just need to remove your feet from the gas pedal and 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.970
 brakes will turn on the help system when 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.370
 downhill and car self safety 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.740
 going down we tried the system 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.169
 not just downhill she slippery grass 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.180
 it works and it is better even 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:00.550
 an experienced driver the thing is that 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.100
 the driver brakes all the wheels at once 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.650
 xmod can do this with every wheel 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:08.229
 separately when the road gets better 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.910
 x-mode can be disabled in principle 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:12.460
 will turn off automatically after 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.470
 reaching a speed of 40 kilometers per hour 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.780
 by the way where exactly at the moment 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.729
 torque is directed to which of 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.340
 wheel driver sees in real 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:23.950
 time on color central display 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.720
 parts of the dashboard by default this most 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.300
 torque is distributed in 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.710
 60 to 40 proportions favor front wheels 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.870
 subaru axes 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.400
 knows a lot about all-wheel drive here he 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.890
 honest and predictable and 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.080
 and not some kind of there we connect 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:40.690
 so on the forester road almost 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.030
 the standard of handling goes where it 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.820
 directs the driver phenomenal manners 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.100
 as for the suv on the steering wheel there is still 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.190
 one switch 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:52.110
 subaru engine mode selection 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:54.300
 Intelligence Drive in default mode 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:57.180
 the car just drives saves fuel 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:59.850
 but if you include sport and character 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.500
 cars will instantly change the engine 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:03.330
 will spin from to higher 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.100
 turns and at deceleration 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:09.710
 do not immediately go to lower 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.710
 good thing for the Crimean mountain roads 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.120
 subaru forester and fourth generation 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.890
 still remains almost 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.590
 the only car in the class 

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:21.870
 no proper name of course formally 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:24.210
 the market has a lot of crossover with full 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:26.340
 driven and spacious interior but so 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:29.070
 almost perfect and behave on 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.350
 pavement and off-road can only he 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:34.970
 forester which has now become larger 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:34.970
 more comfortable and more economical
