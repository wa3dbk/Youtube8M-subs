00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 curiously to the strength that people 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.680
 trying to defend are destroying the 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.800
 wall looks at how many enemies the body 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.019
 screwed because there's no way you 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.150
 destroy a wall 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.920
 they destroyed it will enter record 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.920
 will enter now would have just come in 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:33.200
 already showed a map you already think that the 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.970
 oge map predicts pt if deluded what 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.400
 are these markings are the strengths 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.460
 hour while castle that has has 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.890
 several castles have stands 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.809
 have places for you to pick up 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.540
 because you destroyed a 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.520
 wall or destroyed the gate to invade 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.989
 you need siege weapons do not give 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.360
 to do it on your own and need 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.550
 weapons of being at this moment my 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.030
 faction is red that has all 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:01.370
 castles of the yellow faction tapauÃ¡ pauli 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:05.870
 with us and the blue faction 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:08.510
 picking up more that is the missing w then the 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.640
 red people are good pec and the domain 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.229
 The fighting is trying to invade 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.390
 this fortress in this joyful moment alone 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.010
 which is very far you fattened combat 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.990
 you get back literally 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.610
 It's two minutes of fighting for this. 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.560
 confident backward it seems that they do not 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.140
 They managed to get the castle will come 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.610
 there and show how the word pv 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.670
 foot 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.180
 they have what are called the campaign 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.829
 it is 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.549
 are with those who are champions because 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:36.109
 it's not just today pvp is not everyone at 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.810
 same map are several 

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:40.520
 elton several maps that are the same as you 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.259
 choice do not want to play this map with 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.439
 my friends and lava is having your 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.119
 war then it 's like they're looting 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.700
 there are high-cross servers on 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:53.149
 line server works on pt 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.100
 In the game pv has no server is a 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:57.649
 only server that has those channels 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.450
 those layers that the game goes all over 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.759
 world in the same place only you can be 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.399
 the channel 2 while in the last gp 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.320
 this is not where the servers are and here 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.969
 you choose which home server and 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.979
 where are you going to play with your 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:12.200
 Team whatever and what 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.000
 happens these campaigns were lasted the 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.740
 time are literally campaign 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.620
 so I'll show you how this 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.960
 campaign the domain he is with 8 thousand 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.360
 400 points in the best way though is 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.690
 catching enough is with 6,400 bridge 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.960
 and it's good to ask with 6,200 that's a bonus they have 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.720
 some bonuses's up to strength and 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.670
 the emperor because a player is 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.190
 declared emperor 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.540
 It's okay to be Emperor. 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.319
 these six 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:45.409
 It's cute and castles in case you do not have 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:47.780
 and you have your first aquino right now 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:51.680
 the first one in the ranking is the one that 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:55.370
 its the name of it i'm 4890 i just 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.409
 to enter and the player who formed the 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.670
 player who was the emperor he has 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:01.310
 several advantages 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.340
 in addition these fortresses but can be 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.290
 dominated by lives and only in these 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.780
 that help can do the job 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.760
 trade that this can change this is well 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.530
 complex is not such a simple matter. 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.900
 So I'm talking more 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.730
 it is in these fortresses that all of them 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.169
 can literally place a store for 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.900
 sell their mistakes because nelson 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:23.060
 Lily does not have an auction house with 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.040
 these fortress where you sell your 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.510
 items is just what I put 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.459
 so I would like to have a file from 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.290
 insper great to sell the items not 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.849
 because they do not have their strengths. 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.950
 small places that you can also 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:36.919
 sleeping can not change anything. 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.200
 time from time to time and you have a 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:41.510
 fortress is good to facilitate and these 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.430
 Campaigns so damn expensive touched the 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.560
 trebuchet while was talking in 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.239
 bushehr that kind of catapult that 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.340
 largest in medieval times 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.590
 while you 're talking show a little 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.409
 more here for you 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.840
 these campaigns last 90 days at the end 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:58.519
 from November before seeing who won and 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.319
 emperor and after changing the 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.479
 Emperor can not recover 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:05.930
 for a long time you can stay away from 

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:08.659
 standing for a long time if you let yourself 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:13.040
 anyone taking fortress is then that 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:15.650
 the blues 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.810
 I always questioned the blues the blues 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.959
 are blue in this case here 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.310
 blue is the riffel wfp he is with 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:26.990
 a fortress 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:28.280
 the strong is she the reds that we are 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.280
 is here 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.000
 welbeck stands with fortress frame 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.280
 strong 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.450
 read the 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:42.630
 el forte what you schaumann 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.710
 the bloody broke the neckline the castle of 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:48.000
 leÃ§a that we were attacking 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:50.970
 we dominated and the domain is with 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.740
 mumps and pepe we are not finished 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.510
 to take while you're talking has changed 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.540
 here they just took alex 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.650
 rafael and only if it does not arrive by force 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.220
 people will not be able to 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:05.550
 I fight the red battle is very strange. 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.080
 but is the following each has a color to 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.050
 people are red 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.760
 only that our lives appear blue and 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.850
 enemy's life appears in red 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.950
 if it's kind of confusing but it's so every 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:20.680
 faction has a color 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:27.970
 gift is good test 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:30.940
 is our red interpol blue and the 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:33.160
 Domain and what are you doing? 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.630
 here I am martins there is no rating 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.729
 defending by attacking us too 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.979
 attacking for the end and people are 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:41.110
 waiting to get resources stayed in repo 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:44.080
 reform he arrived upon the fortress 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:47.380
 only attacking the flash in the people just attacking 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.270
 magic is exactly what they are doing 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.370
 and we are starting to show our 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.910
 I write xis here to make a counter 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.280
 attack 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:57.099
 the one guy left sorry my friend you 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:59.259
 if it was not for the leco he was already dead 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:03.880
 but I leave it here, let it use the same 

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:06.280
 you're 1 leg because you 're in the 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.990
 beta still in the launch can not 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.849
 to be like this because it's in play is 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.009
 completely in play 

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:14.050
 perhaps this time decreased decreasing the 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:18.250
 number of players in each of these 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:20.800
 maps and each one of them just there 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:22.449
 in each of these campaigns, people do not 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.150
 You know for sure how many people are 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:27.990
 playing at home the campaign i'm going to die 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.990
 died here
