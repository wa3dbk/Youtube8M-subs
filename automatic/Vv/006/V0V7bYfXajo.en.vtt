00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.860 
i'm going to give you my spin on
contouring<00:01:39.190> so<00:01:39.610> just<00:01:39.910> keep<00:01:40.030> gently<00:01:40.510> building

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 
contouring so just keep gently building

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:41.840 
contouring so just keep gently building
up<00:01:40.960> you<00:01:41.080> don't<00:01:41.230> want<00:01:41.350> to<00:01:41.410> go<00:01:41.470> in<00:01:41.590> and<00:01:41.680> go

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
up you don't want to go in and go

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.040 
up you don't want to go in and go
because<00:01:42.850> it<00:01:42.940> makes<00:01:43.060> it<00:01:43.210> very<00:01:43.240> hard<00:01:43.480> to<00:01:43.720> remove

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
because it makes it very hard to remove

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.410 
because it makes it very hard to remove
color<00:01:44.770> once<00:01:45.130> you<00:01:45.250> put<00:01:45.370> it<00:01:45.460> on<00:01:45.550> so<00:01:46.000> I'm<00:01:46.210> just

I usually apply it in between where a
highlight<00:03:35.550> will<00:03:35.730> go<00:03:35.910> and<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.360> contour<00:03:36.750> is<00:03:36.930> so

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
highlight will go and the contour is so

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.410 
highlight will go and the contour is so
it<00:03:37.410> kind<00:03:37.890> of<00:03:37.950> overlaps<00:03:38.430> both<00:03:38.730> and<00:03:39.060> I<00:03:39.090> just<00:03:39.270> sort

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
it kind of overlaps both and I just sort

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.170 
it kind of overlaps both and I just sort
of<00:03:39.510> apply<00:03:39.720> it<00:03:39.840> until<00:03:40.380> I<00:03:40.650> get<00:03:41.220> a<00:03:41.340> nice<00:03:41.850> little

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
of apply it until I get a nice little

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.890 
of apply it until I get a nice little
blush<00:03:42.540> going<00:03:42.930> on<00:03:43.400> and<00:03:44.400> that<00:03:44.780> brings<00:03:45.780> the

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
blush going on and that brings the

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.840 
blush going on and that brings the
warmth<00:03:46.230> back<00:03:46.380> to<00:03:46.560> my<00:03:46.650> face<00:03:46.860> then<00:03:47.160> you<00:03:47.610> see<00:03:47.790> a

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.640 
warmth back to my face then you see a
little<00:03:50.850> bit<00:03:51.000> Brown<00:03:51.240> further<00:03:51.660> onto<00:03:51.990> the<00:03:52.230> front

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
it gives the sort of and i'm not sure

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.810 
it gives the sort of and i'm not sure
what<00:04:07.260> I<00:04:07.320> would<00:04:07.530> say<00:04:07.680> kind<00:04:08.130> of<00:04:08.220> effect<00:04:08.459> is<00:04:08.670> I
