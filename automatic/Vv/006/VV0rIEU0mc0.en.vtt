00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.380 
cars I like the u-turn cars where they
very<00:03:37.620> rarely<00:03:37.709> ever<00:03:38.220> fall<00:03:38.519> off<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:38.820> tracks<00:03:39.090> but

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
very rarely ever fall off the tracks but

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.280 
very rarely ever fall off the tracks but
you<00:03:39.510> need<00:03:39.690> these<00:03:41.390> pieces<00:03:42.390> here<00:03:42.780> that<00:03:42.930> attach

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
you need these pieces here that attach

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.500 
you need these pieces here that attach
to<00:03:43.320> the<00:03:43.500> outside<00:03:43.820> because<00:03:44.820> the<00:03:44.970> car<00:03:45.180> you<00:03:45.420> know

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
to the outside because the car you know

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.560 
to the outside because the car you know
it's<00:03:45.660> going<00:03:45.810> to<00:03:45.900> be<00:03:45.959> spinning<00:03:46.530> around<00:03:46.620> and<00:03:47.570> the

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
it's going to be spinning around and the

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:53.340 
it's going to be spinning around and the
more<00:03:48.750> of<00:03:48.870> those<00:03:49.019> I<00:03:49.200> get<00:03:49.380> you<00:03:49.590> get<00:03:49.769> to<00:03:49.920> bed

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.440

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.430 
different than these others and this is

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:18.800 
different than these others and this is
