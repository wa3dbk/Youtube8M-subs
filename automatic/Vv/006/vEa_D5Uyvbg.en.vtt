00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:18.960
 so my first contact with the game 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:21.430
 video it was with the small 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.030
 console kind ds but who was at 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.210
 the time 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:27.670
 donkey kong and all because finally 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.250
 actually my father had a store of 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:33.850
 video and they yeah finally he was selling 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.650
 also small consoles games and 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.510
 so every week they brought back 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.610
 one for me to try and so I had 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.750
 too much class at school in the yard and 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:47.590
 there it was on an old apple without a screen 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:50.410
 we hooked up on a TV it was game 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.710
 racing formula a little weird full 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.170
 of pixels and that's his first 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.629
 memories of games that I have on mac 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.300
 I had 50 hours without six 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.729
 it was at my aunt's house a machine with 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.310
 them and pong you're not a console yet 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:09.250
 odyssey but it's jean tavé tennis 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.750
 stuff like volleyball finally everything is 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.390
 emulated a way for it was always 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.000
 to bar and a point that 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.320
 it was my first contact 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.850
 but it did not last very long after 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.640
 this warming noting that atari 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.070
 2600 or so every summer where I spent 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.080
 at lgt on the constable and and my grand 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.010
 mother yelling at me saying I 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.870
 spent my life outside 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.990
 I prefer playing I think that 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.520
 accents on the interest of 1600 so after 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.370
 them as sure as the collisions I 'm 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.720
 reminiscent of the young turbo or flying tavera 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.850
 star the first flying joustard 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.230
 abundant and the impression that you had 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.400
 an accelerator while they were serving 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.380
 not much in fact we were sitting 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.920
 killed then because if we had too bad 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.119
 f 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.909
 the day my dad brought back 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:53.909
 space two game boy spaces 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.579
 of atari actually still and she had 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.229
 the peculiarity of not being able to be 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.149
 it was once a nomadic console 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.149
 so does it operate on mains 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:06.329
 only and my father I at the toilets 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.759
 we were playing cd games launch this kind 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.319
 an ancestor of x games california games 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.140
 where you had bmi to do 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.670
 stupid and unbearable figures you 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.930
 know of roller skating it was horrible of a 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.209
 space of naughty girls they pushed 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.040
 little shouting shifts down and in fact 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.840
 there were lines on the floor that 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.340
 corresponded a kind of tiling it 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.450
 had to jump to every little line 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.560
 alès bessèges 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.690
 there was a kind of seagulls that 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.220
 was going for to do notch what end 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.160
 it was super complicated it was ugly 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.299
 like everything but it was pretty funny case 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.610
 where my first contact with a video game 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:45.920
 it was when I was four or five 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:48.620
 years ago i played tetris at a friend's house and 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.040
 i just farted a cable i told myself 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.430

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.109
 other friend of the party district who was 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.889
 who was offered a game and 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:05.130
 watch 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:08.340
 at the time it was two screens and 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.780
 it was against verdun versus 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.750
 mario end it was actually the decor 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.670

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.859
 was going to save a chick who was 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.410
 imprisoned in raw of a skyscraper with 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:21.690
 donkey kong and who were swinging 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.579

 we keep it 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.110
 a player but it's like playing 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.540
 what was a real party 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:45.230

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.760
 day in people what I've ever had 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.270
 of console when I was young actually 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.470
 the first I think it's sonic 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.380
 I played alone a friend named 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.700
 Jerome left I have long 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.720
 I do not know at all what 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.010
 did others we did not do anything 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.420
 else I have no memory of jean 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.060
 raymond gouge neither in class nor at school 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.920
 nor a birthday is nothing at home 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.600
 memories of him at home where have 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.330
 played both at the megadrive at 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:18.980
 Sonic as sick at a friend's house 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:21.109
 chinese who lives f1 who was in my 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:25.170
 class when I was in primary school 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:26.830
 so here it was in this and 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.360
 because of 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.090
 from his origins he was an immigrant 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.580
 relatively new it was but then 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.930
 gloor ten years all that is game 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.020
 electronic video games that is to say that 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.310
 her room she was hallucinating and this 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.919
 he had this was the first Nintendo 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.139
 the nes with the basic games we had 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.710
 above that is to say so is against this 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:46.509
 kind of things 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.530
 and there for the first time it's the first 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:49.080
 times when I end up with a controller 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.569
 Between hands 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.800
 to see then and conquer who follow you 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:56.349
 it's a so I found that pretty 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:59.789
 exciting and suddenly it was first 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:59.789
 contact and since that seems in what
