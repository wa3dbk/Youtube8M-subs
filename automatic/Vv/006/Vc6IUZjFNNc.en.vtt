00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello everyone how my children are 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.910
 every time I have the favorites of January 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.580
 I will try to make the favorites 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.950
 every month because they are videos that I 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.650
 I find them entertained and I hope that 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.230
 like you too then let's go to 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.109
 start first with things for the 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.000
 hair I'm loving as I said in 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.980
 a chapter in a chapter in a video 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.300
 previous one it serves to leave by there on the 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.230
 new products that I'm loving for 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.880
 my hair and it's the line of two or that of 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.369
 nutrition oil with argan oil 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.630
 what's the shampoo and conditioner 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.450
 like a normal balm 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.820
 the other conditioner that is cougars 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.620
 I like concentrates because they are very 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.780
 jane moisturizers but soft and all 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.770
 no frizz and especially for summer 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.559
 I feel that they are the only ones that 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:50.789
 they keep the hair I do not know then for the 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:55.079
 General care I'm loving this 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:58.289
 body scrub this I bought it 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.379
 They sell it for that worth 9 000 990 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.480
 Chilean pesos that is in the place and is a 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.710
 exfoliating as well as they look very thick 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.680
 because it's like 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.240
 so pure sugar is very thick so 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.979
 both exclude the skin because many 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.270
 body scrub is that they are very 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.670
 soft and I feel that it does not do anything to me 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.960
 this is pillaged and leaves the skin super 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.930
 soft 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.720
 it leaves you as increased because it has 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.190
 jojoba oil and apart they come in 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.190
 several fragrances I have of coconut and 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:30.360
 lime and that very subtle fragrance leaves you 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:32.880
 on the skin and this one I love then I'm 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.580
 Extremely loving baby oil 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.290
 to remove makeup I 'm vaselina del 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.670
 liquid knew that it served him as the 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.149
 makeup oil but from 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.979
 it's really fantastic they are if you use it as 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:49.140
 a normal make-up remover or made in a 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.700
 little ball of the colon and you're going 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.530
 softly and after a while it's time 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.509
 you the entire mascara on trial 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.880
 of water and all those very difficult things 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.340
 of taking out the shot and apart is a lot 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.590
 more gentle than walking using the 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.590
 Eye makeup remover after them 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.869
 I bring an offer of these 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.750
 as between bronzers and blockers 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.090
 of the Austrian gold brand are 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.430
 two for one in maicao but we are all 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.980
 and I want to recommend this to you because I 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.019
 as you know 18 thousand 500 times I am very 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.379
 blanquita but not all in the summer 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:26.110
 it's hard for me to burn myself, let's say coffee 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:28.620
 golden and not stay red this despite 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.269
 that the sun protection factor 15 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.330
 bet all day in the sun with this and 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:36.190
 not good just for nothing a fact that I'm going 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.170
 staying in a more coffee tone can not be 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.989
 see I'm more burned than during the year 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.360
 I have not taken so much sun but the little that 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.560
 I took I used this and giving it perfect 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.349
 so it's all line that are plants 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.760
 who are looking for something to tan 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:52.209
 use this because it brings many 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.010
 natural oils which is what we say 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.299
 that helps you and that makes it so different 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.730
 to other sunscreens 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.379
 then makeup do not make me much in 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.420
 the summer in fact rule that I do not use 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:03.910
 basic now I'm without base I'm just 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.770
 with mascara not any 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.420
 good especially now as after 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.600
 of all acne treatment since I had 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.950
 I do not get pimples anymore then my 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.840
 skin is much more 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.490
 lisa compose has nothing then 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.530
 neither do I feel the need to cover 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.350
 things and in the summer if I do not like 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.270
 use makeup but if what I use or 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.650
 in terms of basic to what I use most 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.290
 is a bronzer on good nights 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.260
 I go partying and what you saved me 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.540
 heaps is this master smoking pencil 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.820
 smoky mailing they showed us in a 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.440
 previous video that is one side of the pencil 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.110
 and on the other side the sponge for 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.210
 blur it will come to clear face of 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.280
 party as was done elsewhere in this 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.870
 it's very fast so I can take it 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.120
 travel everywhere because it 's very nothing 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.130
 and can be created as several looks to 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.680
 Sometimes I make a very thin line or 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.870
 times around the eye then I can 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.000
 create several things with this and then the 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.610
 peak so that we improve to black shadow 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.710
 over and lasts all night they do not run 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.630
 so this is making me very 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.240
 practical for the summer to go out to 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.580
 evenings and nights to go 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.850
 and suddenly a slight touch in the day 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:14.319
 is this petricio skin that is very 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:16.509
 dark is in the color smoked by prou 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:19.900
 it's a color I was looking for it to be 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:23.250
 as in the skin of a wine color 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:27.330
 and I found this 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.890
 from patricio that I loved I loved it 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.760
 loved I loved it and I loved it 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:35.760
 use it also at night to go out 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:39.090
 a little mascara only on the lips 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:42.300
 bronzer on the whole face and ready me 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.010
 It seems very beautiful and apart encounter 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.490
 that would be left and the cycle teeth were 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.490
 whites 

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:52.429
 and then extra stuff is taking that 

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:55.759
 like I showed it in a hall are the 

00:04:52.429 --> 00:04:57.559
 cookies with high heels I love 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:05:00.409
 especially these that are all skin 

00:04:57.559 --> 00:05:02.479
 that are eco-friendly leather are super 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:04.069
 super comfortable with commas is not like 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:05.959
 you are with tacos I can walk a lot 

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:08.889
 and it hurts less, it asks us if 

00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:11.650
 it was not with angelita flat sandal 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:14.500
 and I'm also higher than 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.600
 I have always been myself to be taller 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.130
 and aside the super pretty I'm 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.110
 obsessed has liked me I believe everything 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.850
 the days and also because I have to 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.680
 so our last issue you 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.410
 I'm going to leave all the videos below are 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:31.150
 these temporary tattoos that also 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:33.780
 They are very chorizos and bacanes for the 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:36.640
 summer that comes like this has liked several 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:38.620
 especially to go out at night 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:42.310
 because on the beaches on the beach you can 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:44.470
 be nice but obviously you get bronzed and 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.690
 you have a little tattoo left 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.240
 it happens obviously it is not already left 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:51.669
 because it super reads but it's like saving if 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.169
 you want but it will not go like taking me full 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:54.580
 the beach for one of those tattoos but 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:57.340
 so to go out during the day 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:00.280
 they look super pretty and good social have 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:02.350
 been my January favorites very thing 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.300
 simple because in summer really not a 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:07.280
 doctor to use so many things about everything 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:10.430
 makeup things 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.930
 He dedicated more to take care of my skin and good 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.530
 I hope you liked it and see you 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:17.300
 in a next and have super super 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.770
 are enjoying their vacations 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.940
 crochet girls because I know that our 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.560
 countries 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.360
 I think they're on vacation that even 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.130
 it's like winter here is summer 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.870
 a lot of heat and so we're 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:30.080
 enjoying and traveling everywhere 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:32.169
 so that we see that they are super 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.169
 all right
