00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
hi guys I'm here today to give a review

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.999 
hi guys I'm here today to give a review
about<00:00:03.270> the<00:00:03.600> Moroccan<00:00:03.990> oil<00:00:04.110> treatment<00:00:04.890> the

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
about the Moroccan oil treatment the

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.890 
about the Moroccan oil treatment the
original<00:00:05.430> formula<00:00:06.350> this<00:00:07.350> one<00:00:07.710> was<00:00:08.599> $49<00:00:09.599> for

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
original formula this one was $49 for

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.150 
original formula this one was $49 for
125<00:00:10.740> mils<00:00:12.139> so<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.320> difference<00:00:13.650> between<00:00:13.710> the

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
125 mils so the difference between the

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.560 
125 mils so the difference between the
original<00:00:14.250> formula<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.299> light<00:00:15.570> one<00:00:15.809> is

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570 
original formula and the light one is

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.810 
original formula and the light one is
that<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:19.529> original<00:00:19.830> is<00:00:19.949> mostly<00:00:20.279> for<00:00:20.520> people

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
that the original is mostly for people

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.019 
that the original is mostly for people
with<00:00:20.939> very<00:00:21.150> thick<00:00:21.480> hair<00:00:21.510> so<00:00:22.439> if<00:00:23.310> you<00:00:23.580> have<00:00:23.820> dark

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
with very thick hair so if you have dark

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.189 
with very thick hair so if you have dark
red<00:00:24.269> thick<00:00:24.420> hair<00:00:24.600> I<00:00:24.630> would<00:00:24.750> definitely

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
red thick hair I would definitely

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.679 
red thick hair I would definitely
suggest<00:00:25.350> this<00:00:25.830> if<00:00:26.820> you<00:00:27.000> have<00:00:27.090> blonde<00:00:27.330> blonde

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
suggest this if you have blonde blonde

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.390 
suggest this if you have blonde blonde
or<00:00:27.840> fine<00:00:28.080> hair<00:00:28.109> I<00:00:28.380> would<00:00:28.529> suggest<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.160> light

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
or fine hair I would suggest the light

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.820 
or fine hair I would suggest the light
the<00:00:30.090> light<00:00:30.269> version<00:00:30.510> although<00:00:31.199> if<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.619> have

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
the light version although if you have

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.220 
the light version although if you have
blonde<00:00:32.130> hair<00:00:32.279> that's<00:00:33.180> very<00:00:33.480> very<00:00:33.750> thick<00:00:34.050> I

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
blonde hair that's very very thick I

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.170 
blonde hair that's very very thick I
would<00:00:34.410> say<00:00:34.559> be<00:00:34.710> original<00:00:35.219> because<00:00:35.399> um<00:00:35.880> the

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
would say be original because um the

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.670 
would say be original because um the
original<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:36.600> just<00:00:36.630> slightly<00:00:36.989> heavier

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
original is just slightly heavier

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.900 
original is just slightly heavier
although<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.219> doesn't<00:00:38.489> weigh<00:00:38.550> down<00:00:38.700> your<00:00:38.760> hair

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
although it doesn't weigh down your hair

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.610 
although it doesn't weigh down your hair
at<00:00:39.090> all<00:00:39.270> but<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.110> gives<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:40.469> extra

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
at all but it gives that extra

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.830 
at all but it gives that extra
nourishing<00:00:41.489> effect<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:41.969> thin<00:00:42.270> strands

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
nourishing effect that thin strands

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.920 
nourishing effect that thin strands
don't<00:00:43.050> actually<00:00:43.230> need<00:00:44.210> so<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.239> actually<00:00:45.570> have

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
don't actually need so I actually have

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.709 
don't actually need so I actually have
quite<00:00:46.200> thin<00:00:46.920> hair<00:00:47.280> but<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.910> have<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.180> lot<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.600> it

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
quite thin hair but I have a lot of it

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.490 
quite thin hair but I have a lot of it
so<00:00:50.090> for<00:00:51.090> me<00:00:51.239> Moroccan<00:00:51.719> oil<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.110> original

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
so for me Moroccan oil the original

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.340 
so for me Moroccan oil the original
works<00:00:52.710> like<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.190> charm

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
works like a charm

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.069 
works like a charm
how<00:00:55.350> would<00:00:55.590> actually<00:00:55.980> apply<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:57.570> just

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
how would actually apply it is I just

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.020 
how would actually apply it is I just
wanted<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.829> know<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:58.980> made<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.399> mistake<00:00:59.579> of

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
wanted you know I made this mistake of

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.029 
wanted you know I made this mistake of
applying<00:01:00.329> way<00:01:01.109> too<00:01:01.170> much<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.859> very

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
applying way too much in the very

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.280 
applying way too much in the very
beginning<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:03.539> know<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:03.660> just<00:01:03.899> ended<00:01:04.140> up

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
beginning and you know I just ended up

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.679 
beginning and you know I just ended up
with<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.470> little<00:01:04.830> bit<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.339> know<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:06.299> know<00:01:06.479> but

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
with a little bit you know you know but

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.810 
with a little bit you know you know but
if<00:01:06.780> really<00:01:07.619> heavy<00:01:07.860> hair<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.400> -<00:01:08.520> Gracie

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
if really heavy hair and - Gracie

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.609 
if really heavy hair and - Gracie
because<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.180> applied<00:01:09.510> way<00:01:09.659> too<00:01:09.720> much<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.380> I

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
because I applied way too much so I

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.649 
because I applied way too much so I
found<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.430> actually<00:01:11.909> applying<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.450> little

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
found that actually applying a little

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.999 
found that actually applying a little
goes<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.290> much<00:01:13.619> longer<00:01:14.040> way<00:01:14.390> and<00:01:15.590> it's<00:01:16.590> actually

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
goes a much longer way and it's actually

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.370 
goes a much longer way and it's actually
you<00:01:17.100> just<00:01:17.159> need<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.460> dime-sized<00:01:18.080> so<00:01:19.080> how<00:01:19.259> I'd

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
you just need a dime-sized so how I'd

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.830 
you just need a dime-sized so how I'd
use<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:19.950> after<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.670> wash<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.479> shampoo

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
use it is after you wash and shampoo

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.969 
use it is after you wash and shampoo
your<00:01:22.020> hair<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.259> don't<00:01:22.560> actually<00:01:22.740> need

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
your hair you don't actually need

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.520 
your hair you don't actually need
conditioner<00:01:23.430> because<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:24.270> actually<00:01:24.689> works<00:01:24.930> as

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
conditioner because it actually works as

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.050 
conditioner because it actually works as
a<00:01:25.590> condition<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.250> tangles<00:01:26.640> your<00:01:26.759> hair<00:01:26.939> and

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
a condition of to tangles your hair and

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.090 
a condition of to tangles your hair and
makes<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.330> very<00:01:27.360> soft<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.799> would<00:01:28.950> just

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
makes it very soft and I would just

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.550 
makes it very soft and I would just
squeeze<00:01:29.400> one<00:01:29.729> pump<00:01:30.030> or<00:01:30.329> if<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.200> don't<00:01:31.380> have

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
squeeze one pump or if you don't have

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.050 
squeeze one pump or if you don't have
this<00:01:31.680> pump<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:32.130> would<00:01:32.340> put<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.759> know<00:01:32.880> it's

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
this pump I would put you know it's

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.789 
this pump I would put you know it's
suggest<00:01:33.509> going<00:01:33.780> putting<00:01:34.200> your<00:01:34.290> hand<00:01:34.500> over<00:01:34.590> the

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
suggest going putting your hand over the

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.819 
suggest going putting your hand over the
top<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.310> just<00:01:35.490> pouring<00:01:36.180> like<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:37.229> so<00:01:37.770> you

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
top and just pouring like that so you

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.679 
top and just pouring like that so you
just<00:01:38.070> get<00:01:38.280> like<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.610> little<00:01:38.880> dime<00:01:39.180> size<00:01:39.450> on

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430

through your hair so that it goes all
the<00:01:56.490> way<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:56.969> I<00:01:57.000> would<00:01:57.060> suggest<00:01:57.360> not<00:01:57.780> going<00:01:58.469> to

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
actually helped their self

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.660 
actually helped their self
so<00:02:13.230> it<00:02:13.560> just<00:02:13.740> you<00:02:13.980> know<00:02:14.100> depends<00:02:14.520> on<00:02:14.610> the

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
so it just you know depends on the

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.949 
so it just you know depends on the
condition<00:02:15.120> of<00:02:15.360> your<00:02:15.690> hair<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:17.750> what<00:02:18.750> I<00:02:18.780> would

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
condition of your hair and what I would

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.900 
condition of your hair and what I would
do<00:02:19.110> is<00:02:19.350> I<00:02:19.380> would<00:02:19.530> let<00:02:19.800> it<00:02:19.890> air<00:02:20.069> dry<00:02:20.340> or<00:02:20.370> a<00:02:20.670> blow

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
do is I would let it air dry or a blow

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.490 
do is I would let it air dry or a blow
dry<00:02:21.150> because<00:02:21.420> this<00:02:21.660> actually<00:02:21.840> works<00:02:22.200> since<00:02:22.410> I

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
dry because this actually works since I

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.260 
dry because this actually works since I
heat<00:02:22.709> protectant<00:02:23.280> as<00:02:23.400> well<00:02:23.640> so<00:02:23.940> it<00:02:24.090> doesn't

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
heat protectant as well so it doesn't

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.820 
heat protectant as well so it doesn't
damage<00:02:24.540> your<00:02:24.690> hair<00:02:24.930> to<00:02:25.110> blow-dry<00:02:25.319> it<00:02:25.530> or<00:02:25.800> a

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
damage your hair to blow-dry it or a

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.720 
damage your hair to blow-dry it or a
strict<00:02:26.220> our<00:02:26.400> Flatiron<00:02:26.819> it<00:02:27.620> but<00:02:28.620> if<00:02:29.370> you<00:02:29.520> want

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
strict our Flatiron it but if you want

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.580 
strict our Flatiron it but if you want
to<00:02:29.820> let<00:02:29.910> it<00:02:29.940> air<00:02:30.120> dry<00:02:30.290> Moroccan<00:02:31.290> oil<00:02:31.320> actually

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
to let it air dry Moroccan oil actually

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.250 
to let it air dry Moroccan oil actually
reduces<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.459> drying<00:02:32.730> time<00:02:33.020> makes<00:02:34.020> you<00:02:34.110> dry

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
reduces the drying time makes you dry

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.720 
reduces the drying time makes you dry
very<00:02:34.410> quickly<00:02:34.650> because<00:02:35.010> it<00:02:35.130> separates<00:02:35.430> the

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
very quickly because it separates the

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.850 
very quickly because it separates the
strands<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:36.330> detangles<00:02:36.900> it<00:02:37.020> so<00:02:37.260> it<00:02:37.440> just<00:02:37.470> lets

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
strands and detangles it so it just lets

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.699 
strands and detangles it so it just lets
the<00:02:38.130> air<00:02:38.160> just<00:02:38.550> dry<00:02:38.760> it<00:02:38.790> much<00:02:39.060> faster<00:02:39.540> um<00:02:39.900> and

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
the air just dry it much faster um and

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.580 
the air just dry it much faster um and
then<00:02:41.610> after<00:02:41.640> it<00:02:42.120> dries<00:02:42.420> I<00:02:42.780> would<00:02:43.200> just<00:02:43.410> suggest

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
then after it dries I would just suggest

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.990 
then after it dries I would just suggest
another<00:02:44.340> it's<00:02:44.640> not<00:02:45.060> a<00:02:45.090> pump<00:02:46.459> just<00:02:47.459> so<00:02:47.610> you<00:02:47.700> can

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
another it's not a pump just so you can

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.470 
another it's not a pump just so you can
get<00:02:48.120> rid<00:02:48.330> of<00:02:48.390> get<00:02:48.840> rid<00:02:48.870> of<00:02:49.020> the<00:02:49.260> flyaways<00:02:49.770> and

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
get rid of get rid of the flyaways and

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.880 
get rid of get rid of the flyaways and
then<00:02:51.480> that's<00:02:51.690> all<00:02:51.840> you<00:02:51.870> really<00:02:52.290> need<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:52.709> then

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
then that's all you really need and then

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.550 
then that's all you really need and then
you're<00:02:53.040> done<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.630> it<00:02:54.630> actually<00:02:55.080> it<00:02:55.290> works
