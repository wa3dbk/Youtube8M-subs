00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
to do not in vvt-i is because it just

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.140 
to do not in vvt-i is because it just
sucks<00:01:04.650> it's<00:01:05.040> got<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.400> poorest<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.060> poor

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
but with vvt-i the things that don't

but with vvt-i the things that don't
swap<00:01:16.680> over<00:01:17.040> are<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.850> actual<00:01:18.180> best<00:01:18.360> parts<00:01:18.720> to

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
swap over are the actual best parts to

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.810 
swap over are the actual best parts to
buy<00:01:19.049> which<00:01:19.470> is<00:01:19.590> kind<00:01:19.799> of<00:01:19.860> cool<00:01:20.100> because<00:01:20.250> like

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
buy which is kind of cool because like

buy which is kind of cool because like
for<00:01:21.780> vvt-i<00:01:22.350> motors<00:01:22.920> for<00:01:23.100> example<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.700> can't

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
for vvt-i motors for example you can't

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.969 
for vvt-i motors for example you can't
use<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:25.310> 2j<00:01:26.310> manifold<00:01:26.930> you<00:01:27.930> can't<00:01:28.200> use<00:01:28.470> drop-in

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979
