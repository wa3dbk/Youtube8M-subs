View<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.769> find<00:00:29.070> overlapping<00:00:29.939> faces<00:00:31.489> first

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
View to find overlapping faces first

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.490 
View to find overlapping faces first
let's<00:00:32.940> make<00:00:33.180> sure<00:00:33.239> that<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.809> object<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:34.469> not

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
let's make sure that the object is not

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.299 
let's make sure that the object is not
grouped<00:00:36.260> group<00:00:37.260> ungroup<00:00:37.670> appear<00:00:38.670> on<00:00:38.790> top<00:00:39.059> and

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
grouped group ungroup appear on top and

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.549 
grouped group ungroup appear on top and
now<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.550> ungrouped<00:00:42.000> we<00:00:42.870> also<00:00:43.050> want<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.410> go

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
now it is ungrouped we also want to go

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.779 
now it is ungrouped we also want to go
to<00:00:43.620> customize<00:00:44.570> unit<00:00:45.570> setup<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.789> select

to customize unit setup and select

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.970 
to customize unit setup and select
generic<00:00:48.180> units<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.200> that<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.440> matches<00:00:49.649> our

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
generic units so that it matches our

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.250 
generic units so that it matches our
checkmate<00:00:50.520> script<00:00:52.039> now<00:00:53.750> we<00:00:54.750> want<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.050> go<00:00:55.199> to

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
checkmate script now we want to go to

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.130 
checkmate script now we want to go to
the<00:00:55.530> X<00:00:55.710> View<00:00:56.090> for<00:00:57.949> 2010<00:00:58.949> or<00:00:59.280> 11<00:00:59.340> it<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.690> under

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
the X View for 2010 or 11 it is under

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.060 
the X View for 2010 or 11 it is under
this<00:01:01.530> right<00:01:01.829> here<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.780> for<00:01:03.830> 2012<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.040> later

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
this right here and for 2012 and later

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.300 
this right here and for 2012 and later
it<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.610> under<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.030> plus<00:01:06.650> so<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.680> go<00:01:07.950> down<00:01:07.979> the

there<00:02:06.240> are<00:02:06.329> two<00:02:06.540> ways<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:07.140> fix<00:02:08.129> this<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.700> can

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
there are two ways to fix this you can

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.020 
there are two ways to fix this you can
either<00:02:09.479> go<00:02:09.810> up<00:02:09.989> here<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.770> select<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.430> move

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
either go up here to select and move

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.000 
either go up here to select and move
and<00:02:12.770> use<00:02:13.770> the<00:02:14.570> x-coordinate<00:02:15.570> to<00:02:15.780> move<00:02:16.050> this

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
and use the x-coordinate to move this

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.110 
and use the x-coordinate to move this
face<00:02:17.730> out<00:02:18.000> slightly<00:02:18.540> or<00:02:19.730> you<00:02:20.730> can<00:02:20.880> come<00:02:21.090> down

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
face out slightly or you can come down

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.110 
face out slightly or you can come down
here<00:02:21.300> to<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.690> bottom<00:02:22.080> to<00:02:23.040> absolute<00:02:23.730> mode

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
here to the bottom to absolute mode

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.610 
here to the bottom to absolute mode
transform<00:02:24.990> type-in<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:25.830> click<00:02:26.430> that<00:02:26.700> and

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
transform type-in and click that and

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.670 
transform type-in and click that and
then<00:02:28.620> enter<00:02:29.250> in<00:02:29.460> the<00:02:29.820> x-coordinate<00:02:30.680> right

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
then enter in the x-coordinate right

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.860 
then enter in the x-coordinate right
here<00:02:32.070> so<00:02:32.640> I'm<00:02:32.760> going<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.030> do<00:02:33.210> that<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:33.720> I'm

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
here so I'm going to do that and I'm

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.020 
here so I'm going to do that and I'm
going<00:02:34.050> to<00:02:34.080> put<00:02:34.290> in<00:02:34.410> negative<00:02:36.530> 0.01<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:38.100> press

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
going to put in negative 0.01 and press

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.770 
going to put in negative 0.01 and press
Enter<00:02:40.340> so<00:02:41.340> now<00:02:41.490> it<00:02:41.640> is<00:02:41.700> moved<00:02:42.030> slightly<00:02:42.420> out

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
Enter so now it is moved slightly out

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.470 
Enter so now it is moved slightly out
and<00:02:43.080> should<00:02:43.680> no<00:02:43.860> longer<00:02:43.890> have<00:02:44.550> an<00:02:45.000> overlapping

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
and should no longer have an overlapping

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.730 
and should no longer have an overlapping
face<00:02:45.950> which<00:02:46.950> you<00:02:47.130> can<00:02:47.310> see<00:02:47.580> that<00:02:48.330> it<00:02:48.450> doesn't
