00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.170
 Hello again 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.070
 in the second video lesson I will introduce you to 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.690
 first as the appearance of the animation 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.150
 with classic hand drawn time-lapse 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.369
 animation is one of two types 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.300
 animations that can be done by the program 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.529
 about flash as the name suggests 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.269
 classic frame-by-frame animation this 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.300
 frame drawing picture for 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.910
 a picture and so for example i will draw 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.160
 simple man on simple objects 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.480
 the easiest way to understand the principle of motion 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:40.170
 so I will draw such a little man 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:43.800
 here such hands here it is and for example 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.210
 i want him in one second we're in 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.399
 last time remember you exhibited 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.370
 that per second we have 25 frames 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:56.280
 so he 25 frame y that is this place 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:58.859
 he sat he means what should we do 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.399
 we have to enable tracing paper here this icon 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.690
 It means tracing ie candling 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.880
 of the past image that is because 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.159
 we are now in a new empty frame this is before 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.930
 you are a new blank sheet and we need 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.159
 see what we drew earlier to 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.240
 build on it in our new 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.280
 drawing and so i press tracing paper and 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.909
 shine a frame back and now i'm 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.250
 draw 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.210
 man for example sitting on 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.970
 Squatting here is such an amateur sit on 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.500
 squat 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.740
 I draw a little man 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.680
 and now we have two pictures that is 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.540
 picture 12 that is a simple animation in 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.000
 Basically, I can and do like this 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.070
 there is he can squat endlessly but 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.840
 it is still far from frame 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.990
 classical animation is all the more distant 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.250
 from the cartoon and so by the way 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.860
 these frames 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.470
 the beginning of the movement and the frame of the end of the movement 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.190
 are called keyframes they 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.930
 are important frames to make animation 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:02.100
 was smoothly overs must be more 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:05.850
 so between now these movements we phase 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.100
 im frame which is 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.119
 average image between 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.030
 first and second 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.100
 the image itself is disney when 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.040
 drew a cartoon he drew only 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.110
 first frame and last key ie 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.180
 all the other people he hired 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.160
 they did such a boring job as 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.860
 drawing intermediate frames i.e. 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.040
 puzzles to grooves to this is the most ungrateful 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.570
 work 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.880
 the work of the animator because it is quite 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.760
 not interesting now too i am not getting 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.380
 no pleasure but that 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.440
 it is necessary that the movement was smooth 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.630
 that is, this little man looks like 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.060
 gentle something between the first and 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.130
 second and it allows us to get more 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.470
 smooth animation smooth animation 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.120
 depends on the number of frames is not worth 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.040
 confuse it with those frames that are here 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.700
 stand that is 25 frames per second 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:01.510
 passes in any case but let's say our 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.130
 The first frame lasts as much as 13 frames then 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.900
 there you are going that we stand at the 15th 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.920
 frame 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.390
 Now for example, I'll draw two 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.880
 pictures and we can see 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.990
 simple movement and now with us we see 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.570
 what did he eat animation 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:17.320
 sitting man that is if that 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:19.540
 sits down so he stood now if we 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:24.070
 play the animation by pressing control enter 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:27.130
 we will see we will see animation forever 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:29.290
 sitting down man since he 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.750
 the animation loop runs to the end 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.180
 and start from the very beginning there is no phase like 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.630
 he gets up so I dragged the frames 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:41.920
 who are these frames are all in reverse 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.240
 alright so the animation will pass 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.020
 like a cycle 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.940
 back and in theory we should see 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.950
 such a good physical man 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.960
 we see that man sits and gets up and 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.950
 it will be watching forever until 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.840
 close this window in principle on this 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.050
 simple example can understand the basics 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.690
 animation this can accelerate the whole process 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.470
 Respectively deleting frames extra then 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:12.480
 eat by doing 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:12.480
 frames fewer now delete 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:20.980
 and he is a little man in theory and now on 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.980
 practice should move faster 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.250
 spare run the animation test and 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.670
 we see that he is much faster all this 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:33.890
 doing thats all thats the whole principle 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.390
 time-lapse animation just that you 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.190
 met new classic 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.960
 hand-drawn time-lapse animation more 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.990
 in detail about her as well as many others 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:45.070
 interesting things I will tell you on our 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.070
 television school
