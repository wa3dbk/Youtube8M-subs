there<00:00:00.299> are<00:00:00.420> many<00:00:00.690> times<00:00:01.050> when<00:00:01.439> you'll<00:00:01.650> need<00:00:01.709> to

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
there are many times when you'll need to

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.120 
there are many times when you'll need to
move<00:00:02.190> your<00:00:02.429> objects<00:00:03.030> around<00:00:03.179> in<00:00:03.659> 3d<00:00:04.380> space<00:00:04.650> and

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
move your objects around in 3d space and

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.970 
move your objects around in 3d space and
we<00:00:05.910> do<00:00:06.089> that<00:00:06.240> by<00:00:06.420> using<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:07.049> transform<00:00:07.410> tools

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
we do that by using the transform tools

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.700 
we do that by using the transform tools
before<00:00:08.849> we<00:00:09.330> actually<00:00:09.540> start<00:00:09.870> transforming

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
before we actually start transforming

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.160 
before we actually start transforming
objects<00:00:11.370> around<00:00:11.550> we<00:00:12.389> need<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.780> know<00:00:12.929> where

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
objects around we need to know where

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.499 
objects around we need to know where
we're<00:00:13.380> going<00:00:13.590> to<00:00:13.740> be<00:00:13.860> transforming<00:00:14.549> them<00:00:14.730> we

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
we're going to be transforming them we

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.900 
we're going to be transforming them we
need<00:00:15.780> to<00:00:15.960> do<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.139> little<00:00:16.410> bit<00:00:16.740> about<00:00:16.980> how<00:00:17.250> 3d

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
need to do a little bit about how 3d

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.660 
need to do a little bit about how 3d
space<00:00:18.240> works<00:00:18.690> in<00:00:18.960> blender<00:00:19.500> so<00:00:20.250> if<00:00:20.430> I<00:00:20.609> start

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
space works in blender so if I start

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.509 
space works in blender so if I start
orbiting<00:00:21.390> my<00:00:21.720> scene<00:00:21.990> you<00:00:22.590> will<00:00:22.769> notice<00:00:23.010> I<00:00:23.310> have

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
orbiting my scene you will notice I have

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.730 
orbiting my scene you will notice I have
a<00:00:23.550> little<00:00:23.910> icon<00:00:24.449> in<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.779> bottom<00:00:24.960> corner<00:00:25.199> of

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
a little icon in the bottom corner of

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.920 
a little icon in the bottom corner of
this<00:00:25.920> screen<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.550> I<00:00:26.670> also<00:00:26.970> have<00:00:27.390> some<00:00:27.660> green

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
this screen and I also have some green

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.410 
this screen and I also have some green
and<00:00:28.109> red<00:00:28.410> axis<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.130> these<00:00:29.670> just<00:00:30.000> tell<00:00:30.240> me

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
and red axis and these just tell me

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.940 
and red axis and these just tell me
where<00:00:30.630> my<00:00:30.840> x<00:00:31.109> y<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.009> z<00:00:32.189> axes<00:00:32.850> are<00:00:33.030> my<00:00:33.960> z<00:00:34.020> axis<00:00:34.290> is

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
where my x y and z axes are my z axis is

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.430 
where my x y and z axes are my z axis is
my<00:00:35.130> vertical<00:00:35.399> axis<00:00:36.149> which<00:00:36.420> isn't<00:00:36.840> showing<00:00:37.140> up

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
my vertical axis which isn't showing up

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.010 
my vertical axis which isn't showing up
on<00:00:37.649> my<00:00:37.800> grid<00:00:38.100> but<00:00:38.640> just<00:00:38.910> know<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:39.210> Z<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.719> up

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
on my grid but just know that Z is up

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.069 
on my grid but just know that Z is up
and<00:00:40.230> down<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.590> x<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.309> y<00:00:41.520> movie<00:00:42.000> left<00:00:42.239> right

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
and down and x and y movie left right

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.069 
and down and x and y movie left right
and<00:00:43.290> forward<00:00:43.710> back<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.879> if<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.210> want<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.629> move<00:00:45.930> an

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
and forward back so if I want to move an

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.619 
and forward back so if I want to move an
object<00:00:46.289> probably<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.640> easiest<00:00:48.059> way<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.390> do

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
object probably the easiest way to do

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.690 
object probably the easiest way to do
that<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.989> hit<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.469> translate<00:00:49.980> key<00:00:50.250> here<00:00:50.550> in

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
that is to hit the translate key here in

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.990 
that is to hit the translate key here in
the<00:00:50.850> object<00:00:51.329> tools<00:00:51.690> panel<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:52.379> can<00:00:53.129> also<00:00:53.399> get<00:00:53.850> to

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
the object tools panel I can also get to

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.170 
the object tools panel I can also get to
that<00:00:54.090> by<00:00:54.270> using<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.930> jihad<00:00:55.469> key<00:00:55.739> G<00:00:56.579> stands<00:00:56.940> for

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
that by using the jihad key G stands for

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.170 
that by using the jihad key G stands for
grab<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:58.469> if<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:58.859> were<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.070> right<00:00:59.460> click<00:00:59.670> on<00:00:59.969> an

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
grab so if I were to right click on an

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.049 
grab so if I were to right click on an
object<00:01:00.420> say<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.079> table<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.649> hit<00:01:01.920> G<00:01:02.309> notice

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
object say the table and hit G notice

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.820 
object say the table and hit G notice
how<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.480> turns<00:01:03.750> white<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.320> now<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:04.530> can

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
how it turns white and now I can

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.310 
how it turns white and now I can
translate<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.460> object<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.240> really<00:01:07.110> don't

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
translate that object I really don't

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.190 
translate that object I really don't
know<00:01:07.439> exactly<00:01:08.040> where<00:01:08.340> I'm<00:01:08.549> translating<00:01:09.200> you

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
know exactly where I'm translating you

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.770 
know exactly where I'm translating you
see<00:01:10.470> in<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.890> bottom<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.549> screen<00:01:11.790> it<00:01:12.360> kind

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
see in the bottom of the screen it kind

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.219 
see in the bottom of the screen it kind
of<00:01:12.900> has<00:01:13.110> these<00:01:13.380> numbers<00:01:13.770> here<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:14.280> DX<00:01:14.760> D<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.720> D

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
of has these numbers here of DX D and D

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.320 
of has these numbers here of DX D and D
Z<00:01:16.500> which<00:01:17.130> kind<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.580> tell<00:01:17.820> me<00:01:17.850> where<00:01:18.210> it's

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
Z which kind of tell me where it's

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.440 
Z which kind of tell me where it's
moving<00:01:18.930> but<00:01:19.080> because<00:01:19.979> I've<00:01:20.159> got<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.490> 2d<00:01:21.000> screen

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
moving but because I've got a 2d screen

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.140 
moving but because I've got a 2d screen
and<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.840> 3d<00:01:22.380> space<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:23.100> can't<00:01:23.729> tell<00:01:24.000> exactly

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
and a 3d space I can't tell exactly

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.600 
and a 3d space I can't tell exactly
whether<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:24.900> am<00:01:25.110> removing<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.860> left<00:01:26.130> or<00:01:26.340> right

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
whether I am removing it left or right

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.870 
whether I am removing it left or right
or<00:01:26.790> up<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.090> down<00:01:27.299> are<00:01:27.720> back<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.229> forth

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
or up and down are back and forth

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.760 
or up and down are back and forth
probably<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.090> easier<00:01:30.540> way<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.840> do<00:01:31.200> this<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.439> to

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
probably the easier way to do this is to

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.520 
probably the easier way to do this is to
constrain<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.460> motion<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.150> objects<00:01:33.689> so

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
constrain the motion of the objects so

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.620 
constrain the motion of the objects so
if<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:34.890> were<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.130> hit<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.549> translate<00:01:36.030> key<00:01:36.299> again

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
if I were to hit the translate key again

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.649 
if I were to hit the translate key again
and<00:01:36.930> this<00:01:37.409> time<00:01:37.470> hit<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.159> X<00:01:38.369> key<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:39.299> notice

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
and this time hit the X key you notice

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.990 
and this time hit the X key you notice
how<00:01:39.869> i<00:01:39.900> can<00:01:40.259> actually<00:01:40.710> move<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.189> along<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.610> x

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
how i can actually move it along the x

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.469 
how i can actually move it along the x
axis<00:01:42.299> if<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:43.560> were<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.920> hit<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.250> Y<00:01:44.460> key<00:01:44.729> notice

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
axis if I were to hit the Y key notice

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.870 
axis if I were to hit the Y key notice
how<00:01:45.689> i<00:01:45.720> can<00:01:46.079> move<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.439> along<00:01:46.619> Y<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.610> same

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
how i can move it along Y and the same

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.740 
how i can move it along Y and the same
for<00:01:48.180> see<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:49.049> can<00:01:49.290> move<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:49.649> along<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.070> z<00:01:50.340> axis

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
for see you can move it along the z axis

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.749 
for see you can move it along the z axis
this<00:01:51.750> is<00:01:52.020> great<00:01:52.290> because<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.860> allows<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.549> to

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
this is great because it allows you to

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.749 
this is great because it allows you to
constrain<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.420> way<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.869> object<00:01:55.350> moves

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
constrain the way that the object moves

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.550 
constrain the way that the object moves
another<00:01:56.759> way<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.030> get<00:01:57.299> more<00:01:57.570> constraint<00:01:58.170> over

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
another way to get more constraint over

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.620 
another way to get more constraint over
the<00:01:58.680> way<00:01:58.829> an<00:01:59.040> object<00:01:59.549> moves<00:01:59.850> is<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.210> use<00:02:00.450> an

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
the way an object moves is to use an

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:13.660 
the way an object moves is to use an
orthographic<00:02:01.200> view<00:02:01.649> port

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.390 

so<00:02:14.390> if<00:02:14.569> I<00:02:14.780> were<00:02:14.959> to<00:02:15.020> hit<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.440> number<00:02:15.620> 7<00:02:16.160> key

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
so if I were to hit the number 7 key

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.089 
so if I were to hit the number 7 key
online<00:02:16.610> on<00:02:17.030> pad<00:02:17.240> go<00:02:17.690> to<00:02:17.750> my<00:02:18.050> top<00:02:18.349> viewport<00:02:18.739> and

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
online on pad go to my top viewport and

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.000 
online on pad go to my top viewport and
then<00:02:19.400> hit<00:02:19.730> five<00:02:19.970> to<00:02:20.270> go<00:02:20.420> to<00:02:20.480> orthographic<00:02:21.080> then

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
then hit five to go to orthographic then

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.610 
then hit five to go to orthographic then
when<00:02:22.220> I<00:02:22.250> grab<00:02:22.580> this<00:02:22.760> object<00:02:23.300> and<00:02:23.480> move<00:02:23.750> it<00:02:23.989> I<00:02:24.200> am

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
when I grab this object and move it I am

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.920 
when I grab this object and move it I am
basically<00:02:25.069> only<00:02:25.489> moving<00:02:25.910> it<00:02:26.150> in<00:02:26.270> the<00:02:26.390> X<00:02:26.599> Y

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
basically only moving it in the X Y

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.380 
basically only moving it in the X Y
plane<00:02:27.400> because<00:02:28.400> I'm<00:02:28.610> looking<00:02:28.819> straight<00:02:29.360> down

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
plane because I'm looking straight down

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.650 
plane because I'm looking straight down
at<00:02:29.870> it<00:02:30.020> I'm<00:02:30.230> just<00:02:31.100> rearranging<00:02:31.910> it<00:02:32.060> along<00:02:32.420> the

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
at it I'm just rearranging it along the

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.170 
at it I'm just rearranging it along the
floor<00:02:32.959> so<00:02:33.800> I<00:02:33.830> am<00:02:34.130> going<00:02:34.400> to<00:02:34.640> go<00:02:34.819> ahead<00:02:34.850> and

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
floor so I am going to go ahead and

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.900 
floor so I am going to go ahead and
bring<00:02:35.569> this<00:02:35.840> back<00:02:36.110> into<00:02:36.470> perspective<00:02:36.830> mode<00:02:37.370> by

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
bring this back into perspective mode by

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.850 
bring this back into perspective mode by
just<00:02:38.209> orbiting<00:02:38.600> my<00:02:38.900> camera<00:02:39.319> and<00:02:39.440> hitting<00:02:39.830> the

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
just orbiting my camera and hitting the

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.910 
just orbiting my camera and hitting the
number<00:02:40.310> 5<00:02:40.600> another<00:02:41.600> way<00:02:41.840> to<00:02:41.870> move<00:02:42.260> the<00:02:42.470> object

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
number 5 another way to move the object

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.890 
number 5 another way to move the object
is<00:02:43.069> to<00:02:43.310> actually<00:02:43.519> move<00:02:44.030> it<00:02:44.269> by<00:02:44.420> discrete

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
is to actually move it by discrete

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.470 
is to actually move it by discrete
numbers<00:02:45.440> we<00:02:46.280> can<00:02:46.519> do<00:02:46.670> this<00:02:46.850> in<00:02:46.910> a<00:02:47.150> number<00:02:47.330> of

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
numbers we can do this in a number of

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.410 
numbers we can do this in a number of
places<00:02:47.810> if<00:02:48.290> I<00:02:48.980> go<00:02:49.160> over<00:02:49.190> to<00:02:49.580> my<00:02:49.850> properties

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
places if I go over to my properties

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.350 
places if I go over to my properties
panel<00:02:50.750> here<00:02:51.170> and<00:02:51.410> I<00:02:51.590> hit<00:02:51.890> object<00:02:52.400> you<00:02:52.910> will<00:02:53.120> see

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
panel here and I hit object you will see

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.479 
panel here and I hit object you will see
that<00:02:53.510> i<00:02:53.569> have<00:02:53.720> numbers<00:02:54.290> here<00:02:54.590> for<00:02:54.830> translation

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
that i have numbers here for translation

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.080 
that i have numbers here for translation
so<00:02:56.269> I<00:02:56.299> can<00:02:56.630> move<00:02:56.810> my<00:02:56.870> x<00:02:57.350> position<00:02:57.620> here<00:02:58.340> my<00:02:58.880> Y

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
so I can move my x position here my Y

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.350 
so I can move my x position here my Y
position<00:02:59.390> here<00:02:59.959> or<00:03:00.140> my<00:03:00.410> Z<00:03:00.709> position<00:03:01.010> here<00:03:01.670> so

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
position here or my Z position here so

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.410 
position here or my Z position here so
for<00:03:02.630> example<00:03:02.660> if<00:03:03.230> I<00:03:03.709> wanted<00:03:04.130> exactly<00:03:04.430> at<00:03:04.970> 0<00:03:05.269> and

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
for example if I wanted exactly at 0 and

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.530 
for example if I wanted exactly at 0 and
see<00:03:05.930> I<00:03:06.170> could<00:03:06.680> just<00:03:06.920> type<00:03:07.190> 0<00:03:07.640> and<00:03:07.940> it<00:03:08.180> would<00:03:08.360> go

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
see I could just type 0 and it would go

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:20.650 
see I could just type 0 and it would go
to<00:03:08.600> 0<00:03:09.140> I<00:03:17.829> can<00:03:18.829> also<00:03:19.100> get<00:03:19.549> to<00:03:19.700> these<00:03:19.820> tools<00:03:20.329> by

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
to 0 I can also get to these tools by

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.810 
to 0 I can also get to these tools by
bringing<00:03:21.109> out<00:03:21.290> the<00:03:21.500> properties<00:03:22.040> panel<00:03:22.340> here

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
bringing out the properties panel here

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.810 
bringing out the properties panel here
so<00:03:23.600> if<00:03:23.720> i<00:03:23.900> want<00:03:24.230> to<00:03:24.320> i<00:03:24.470> have<00:03:24.920> my<00:03:25.130> object<00:03:25.579> that's

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
so if i want to i have my object that's

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.759 
so if i want to i have my object that's
selected<00:03:26.329> again<00:03:27.200> i<00:03:27.230> can<00:03:27.590> go<00:03:27.829> x<00:03:28.130> y<00:03:28.850> and<00:03:29.180> c<00:03:29.930> so

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
selected again i can go x y and c so

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.470 
selected again i can go x y and c so
those<00:03:31.010> are<00:03:31.250> two<00:03:31.280> additional<00:03:31.579> ways<00:03:32.209> to

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
those are two additional ways to

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.140 
those are two additional ways to
transform<00:03:32.930> objects<00:03:33.560> and<00:03:33.769> that<00:03:34.549> way<00:03:34.760> you<00:03:34.820> can

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
transform objects and that way you can

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.380 
transform objects and that way you can
also<00:03:35.390> type<00:03:35.810> in<00:03:36.049> very<00:03:36.350> precise<00:03:36.859> numbers<00:03:37.400> I<00:03:37.640> am

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
also type in very precise numbers I am

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.300 
also type in very precise numbers I am
going<00:03:38.630> to<00:03:38.870> go<00:03:39.079> ahead<00:03:39.109> and<00:03:39.410> get<00:03:39.799> rid<00:03:40.010> of<00:03:40.070> those

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
going to go ahead and get rid of those

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.849 
going to go ahead and get rid of those
here<00:03:40.700> one<00:03:41.480> additional<00:03:42.019> way<00:03:42.230> to<00:03:42.260> translate

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
here one additional way to translate

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:45.310 
here one additional way to translate
objects<00:03:43.400> is<00:03:43.609> to<00:03:43.790> use<00:03:44.000> the<00:03:44.209> transform<00:03:44.600> key<00:03:45.079> and

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
objects is to use the transform key and

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.650 
objects is to use the transform key and
you<00:03:45.980> can<00:03:46.190> do<00:03:46.370> this<00:03:46.549> by<00:03:46.760> going<00:03:46.970> down<00:03:47.299> to<00:03:47.540> the

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
you can do this by going down to the

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.110 
you can do this by going down to the
bottom<00:03:47.870> of<00:03:48.140> your<00:03:48.200> 3d<00:03:48.920> viewport<00:03:49.459> and<00:03:49.640> clicking

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
bottom of your 3d viewport and clicking

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.539 
bottom of your 3d viewport and clicking
here<00:03:50.420> but<00:03:51.079> what<00:03:51.350> you<00:03:51.560> would<00:03:51.769> be<00:03:51.890> able<00:03:52.010> see<00:03:52.310> here

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
here but what you would be able see here

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:55.090 
here but what you would be able see here
is<00:03:52.670> this<00:03:52.850> arrow<00:03:53.120> the<00:03:53.660> curve<00:03:54.049> and<00:03:54.260> this<00:03:54.829> little

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
is this arrow the curve and this little

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.819 
is this arrow the curve and this little
scale<00:03:55.489> tool<00:03:55.820> here<00:03:56.299> but<00:03:56.959> I<00:03:56.989> want<00:03:57.470> to<00:03:57.560> make<00:03:57.799> sure

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
scale tool here but I want to make sure

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.640 
scale tool here but I want to make sure
it's<00:03:58.310> on<00:03:58.519> the<00:03:58.730> arrow<00:03:58.910> and<00:03:59.299> when<00:04:00.049> it's<00:04:00.230> on<00:04:00.470> the

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
it's on the arrow and when it's on the

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.250 
it's on the arrow and when it's on the
arrow<00:04:00.829> this<00:04:01.549> little<00:04:01.850> gizmo<00:04:02.120> comes<00:04:02.660> up<00:04:02.930> and<00:04:03.079> it

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
arrow this little gizmo comes up and it

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.830

i<00:04:16.160> also<00:04:16.820> can<00:04:17.209> move<00:04:17.419> multiple<00:04:17.840> objects<00:04:18.530> all<00:04:18.799> i

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
i also can move multiple objects all i

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.849 
i also can move multiple objects all i
have<00:04:19.760> to<00:04:19.789> do<00:04:20.120> is<00:04:20.150> just<00:04:20.299> shift<00:04:20.930> +<00:04:21.260> select<00:04:21.440> them
