00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
a cap and hold game type so you've got

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.589 
a cap and hold game type so you've got

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
point and point at it and like activate

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.110 
point and point at it and like activate
this<00:03:48.220> this<00:03:48.579> orb<00:03:48.940> and<00:03:49.709> then<00:03:50.709> your<00:03:51.639> team<00:03:51.819> has<00:03:51.970> to

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
this this orb and then your team has to

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.460 
this this orb and then your team has to
defend<00:03:52.389> it<00:03:52.599> for<00:03:52.780> a<00:03:52.810> certain<00:03:53.079> amount<00:03:53.109> of<00:03:53.319> time

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.770 
defend it for a certain amount of time
after<00:03:53.709> that<00:03:54.040> happens<00:03:54.430> before<00:03:54.940> it<00:03:55.359> is<00:03:55.510> cleared

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
after that happens before it is cleared

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.089 
after that happens before it is cleared
from<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:55.989> map<00:03:56.200> and<00:03:56.440> your<00:03:56.620> team<00:03:56.829> gets<00:03:57.010> a<00:03:57.069> point

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:57.099 
from the map and your team gets a point

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:59.849 
from the map and your team gets a point
for<00:03:57.430> that<00:03:57.489> and<00:03:57.910> so<00:03:58.780> there'll<00:03:58.959> be<00:03:59.019> like<00:03:59.200> five<00:03:59.470> or

00:03:59.849 --> 00:03:59.859 
for that and so there'll be like five or

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:03.270 
for that and so there'll be like five or
so<00:04:00.010> orbs<00:04:00.430> on<00:04:00.669> a<00:04:00.700> map<00:04:01.090> whatever<00:04:01.660> and<00:04:01.900> so<00:04:02.769> the

so orbs on a map whatever and so the

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.879 
so orbs on a map whatever and so the

team that gets three wins I don't know

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:07.080 
team that gets three wins I don't know
if<00:04:05.950> they're<00:04:06.040> going<00:04:06.129> to<00:04:06.220> cut<00:04:06.400> the<00:04:06.489> map<00:04:06.639> short

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
if they're going to cut the map short

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.020 
if they're going to cut the map short
once<00:04:07.389> a<00:04:07.510> team<00:04:07.690> has<00:04:07.720> already<00:04:08.790> inevitably<00:04:09.790> one

leave fewer people back to defend and go

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.870 
leave fewer people back to defend and go
start<00:04:50.380> getting<00:04:50.440> more<00:04:50.770> aggressive<00:04:50.890> and<00:04:51.400> try

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
start getting more aggressive and try
