00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.110 
done it I don't know how well this works

to the website for the sort of the

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.420 
to the website for the sort of the
proper<00:00:12.410> writer<00:00:12.620> because<00:00:12.920> I<00:00:13.040> won't<00:00:13.220> really<00:00:13.370> be

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:13.430 
proper writer because I won't really be

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.269 
proper writer because I won't really be
able<00:00:13.520> to<00:00:13.640> demonstrate<00:00:13.880> on<00:00:14.270> the<00:00:14.330> video<00:00:14.570> but

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:15.279 
able to demonstrate on the video but

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:17.740 
able to demonstrate on the video but
recently<00:00:16.279> I<00:00:16.340> somehow<00:00:16.640> lost<00:00:16.760> one<00:00:17.330> of<00:00:17.359> the<00:00:17.480> buds

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
recently I somehow lost one of the buds

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.009 
recently I somehow lost one of the buds
off<00:00:18.109> my<00:00:18.350> sign<00:00:18.560> either<00:00:18.740> cx500<00:00:19.550> and<00:00:20.089> it<00:00:20.839> was

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:21.019 
off my sign either cx500 and it was

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:23.169 
off my sign either cx500 and it was
quite<00:00:21.230> amazing<00:00:21.410> the<00:00:22.220> difference<00:00:22.249> that<00:00:22.699> and

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:23.179 
quite amazing the difference that and

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:24.909 
quite amazing the difference that and
like<00:00:23.419> spares<00:00:23.869> so<00:00:24.289> to<00:00:24.349> speak<00:00:24.619> with<00:00:24.800> their

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:24.919 
like spares so to speak with their

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:28.450 
like spares so to speak with their
smaller<00:00:25.599> smaller<00:00:26.599> buds<00:00:27.050> so<00:00:27.560> I<00:00:27.890> guess

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
smaller smaller buds so I guess

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.960 
smaller smaller buds so I guess
basically<00:00:28.820> don't<00:00:29.150> feel<00:00:29.599> my<00:00:29.749> ear<00:00:29.900> properly<00:00:30.289> and

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 
basically don't feel my ear properly and

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.330 
basically don't feel my ear properly and
did<00:00:32.050> output<00:00:33.050> from<00:00:33.170> the<00:00:33.380> headphone<00:00:34.160> just

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
did output from the headphone just

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.930 
did output from the headphone just
seemed<00:00:34.520> really<00:00:34.760> quiet<00:00:36.430> well<00:00:37.430> it<00:00:37.550> seems<00:00:37.700> quite

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940

as<00:02:24.010> this<00:02:24.100> going<00:02:24.340> to<00:02:24.400> be

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.380 

okay<00:02:33.560> I<00:02:33.590> think<00:02:33.770> it's<00:02:34.010> pretty<00:02:34.190> much<00:02:34.400> on<00:02:37.300> only<00:02:38.300> it

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
okay I think it's pretty much on only it

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.870 
okay I think it's pretty much on only it
a<00:02:38.420> bit<00:02:38.630> squished<00:02:39.140> now<00:02:39.470> so<00:02:40.069> hopefully<00:02:40.250> that<00:02:42.880> yes

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
a bit squished now so hopefully that yes

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.640 
a bit squished now so hopefully that yes
I<00:02:44.120> think<00:02:44.300> you<00:02:44.360> can<00:02:44.450> see<00:02:44.600> it<00:02:44.690> kind<00:02:44.810> of<00:02:44.900> slowly

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
I think you can see it kind of slowly

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.340 
I think you can see it kind of slowly
gradually<00:02:47.350> comes<00:02:48.350> back<00:02:48.740> out<00:02:49.900> so<00:02:50.900> obviously

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
gradually comes back out so obviously

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.979 
gradually comes back out so obviously
when<00:02:51.560> it's<00:02:51.590> in<00:02:51.830> your<00:02:51.980> air<00:02:52.569> you<00:02:53.569> squash<00:02:53.870> you

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
when it's in your air you squash you

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.390 
when it's in your air you squash you
into<00:02:54.230> place<00:02:54.440> and<00:02:54.650> then<00:02:54.709> the<00:02:54.860> phone<00:02:55.069> should

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
into place and then the phone should

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.830 
into place and then the phone should
sort<00:02:55.610> of<00:02:55.670> expand<00:02:56.270> back<00:02:58.180> so<00:02:59.180> that<00:02:59.209> you<00:02:59.540> know<00:02:59.660> so

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
sort of expand back so that you know so

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:06.400 
sort of expand back so that you know so
it<00:02:59.930> fills<00:03:00.380> your<00:03:00.709> ear<00:03:01.840> canal<00:03:02.840> I<00:03:03.290> guess<00:03:05.380> with<00:03:06.380> the

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
it fills your ear canal I guess with the

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.650 
it fills your ear canal I guess with the
second<00:03:06.980> one<00:03:07.130> so<00:03:07.940> as<00:03:08.030> I<00:03:08.090> said<00:03:08.209> I'm<00:03:08.330> not<00:03:08.360> reading

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
second one so as I said I'm not reading

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:09.850 
second one so as I said I'm not reading
we<00:03:08.870> have<00:03:08.959> to<00:03:09.050> demonstrate<00:03:09.230> it<00:03:09.560> to<00:03:09.590> on<00:03:09.769> the

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
we have to demonstrate it to on the

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.729 
we have to demonstrate it to on the
video<00:03:10.540> so<00:03:11.540> what<00:03:11.660> I'll<00:03:11.780> do<00:03:11.900> I'll<00:03:12.019> use<00:03:12.320> this<00:03:12.470> row

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
video so what I'll do I'll use this row

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.330 
video so what I'll do I'll use this row
I<00:03:12.980> use<00:03:13.459> them<00:03:13.670> for<00:03:13.910> a<00:03:14.120> day<00:03:14.390> or<00:03:14.540> two<00:03:15.340> hopefully

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
I use them for a day or two hopefully

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.270 
I use them for a day or two hopefully
you<00:03:16.670> can<00:03:16.880> get<00:03:17.060> this<00:03:17.239> one<00:03:17.480> under<00:03:17.600> the<00:03:17.690> world

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.440 

want<00:03:22.280> to<00:03:22.340> turn<00:03:22.640> and<00:03:22.970> I<00:03:23.030> mean<00:03:23.150> even<00:03:23.269> though

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
want to turn and I mean even though

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:32.720 
want to turn and I mean even though
those<00:03:23.569> three<00:03:23.959> here<00:03:24.140> we<00:03:24.230> go

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.970 

so<00:03:33.330> again<00:03:33.629> that's<00:03:33.780> all<00:03:34.050> pretty<00:03:34.290> battered<00:03:34.620> out

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
so again that's all pretty battered out

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.229 
so again that's all pretty battered out
of<00:03:35.129> shape<00:03:37.430> as<00:03:38.430> you<00:03:38.580> can<00:03:38.670> see<00:03:38.790> with<00:03:38.879> the<00:03:39.000> first

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
of shape as you can see with the first

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:46.789 
of shape as you can see with the first
one<00:03:39.510> on<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:40.200> right<00:03:40.440> that<00:03:40.920> has<00:03:41.190> returned<00:03:41.760> to<00:03:45.799> to

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
one on the right that has returned to to

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.259 
one on the right that has returned to to
normality<00:03:48.920> I'm<00:03:49.920> going<00:03:50.160> to<00:03:50.220> try<00:03:50.400> and<00:03:50.519> push<00:03:51.090> it

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
normality I'm going to try and push it

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.520 
normality I'm going to try and push it
in<00:03:51.390> now<00:03:53.450> that<00:03:54.450> does<00:03:54.690> that<00:03:54.959> feels<00:03:55.230> pretty<00:03:55.290> good

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
in now that does that feels pretty good

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.979 
in now that does that feels pretty good
in<00:03:55.769> my<00:03:55.920> ear<00:03:56.099> the<00:03:56.400> other<00:03:56.549> one<00:03:56.670> so<00:03:57.269> as<00:03:57.510> I<00:03:57.629> say<00:03:57.810> a

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
in my ear the other one so as I say a

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.319 
in my ear the other one so as I say a
bit<00:03:58.799> of<00:03:58.920> an<00:03:59.010> odd<00:03:59.099> thing<00:03:59.280> to<00:03:59.340> review<00:03:59.790> via<00:03:59.970> video

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
bit of an odd thing to review via video

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:02.240 
bit of an odd thing to review via video
head<00:04:01.019> to<00:04:01.140> hemorrhoids<00:04:01.470> to<00:04:01.650> net<00:04:01.829> but<00:04:01.950> I<00:04:02.040> will

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
head to hemorrhoids to net but I will

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.619 
head to hemorrhoids to net but I will
come<00:04:02.430> back<00:04:02.549> and<00:04:02.730> report<00:04:03.000> back<00:04:03.090> in<00:04:03.299> a<00:04:03.360> couple<00:04:03.480> of

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
I've been using these these foam tips

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.710 
I've been using these these foam tips
for<00:04:13.680> a<00:04:13.709> couple<00:04:13.950> of<00:04:13.980> days<00:04:14.099> now<00:04:14.400> I've<00:04:14.579> had<00:04:15.450> a<00:04:15.480> few

for a couple of days now I've had a few

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.390 
for a couple of days now I've had a few
journeys<00:04:16.109> on<00:04:16.199> my<00:04:16.289> bike<00:04:16.880> into<00:04:17.880> the<00:04:18.000> gym<00:04:18.380> and<00:04:19.400> I

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
journeys on my bike into the gym and I

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.590 
journeys on my bike into the gym and I

say I'm really quite impressed
definitely<00:04:22.560> an<00:04:22.770> improvement<00:04:23.010> on<00:04:23.400> even<00:04:24.000> the

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
definitely an improvement on even the

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.439 
definitely an improvement on even the
proper<00:04:24.510> fitting<00:04:24.930> rubber<00:04:25.800> ones<00:04:26.490> or<00:04:26.880> plastic<00:04:27.330> he

wants the Hat before if I give you an
example<00:04:30.810> when<00:04:31.470> I've<00:04:31.590> been<00:04:31.770> at<00:04:31.860> the<00:04:31.919> gym<00:04:31.949> they

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
example when I've been at the gym they

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.250 
example when I've been at the gym they
have<00:04:32.340> music<00:04:32.460> playing<00:04:32.699> in<00:04:32.940> the<00:04:32.970> gym<00:04:33.240> and<00:04:33.419> I'm

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
fairly sure on the old ones even though

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.310 
fairly sure on the old ones even though
it's<00:04:36.180> hard<00:04:36.270> time<00:04:36.479> there's<00:04:36.690> over<00:04:36.810> we<00:04:36.990> together

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
it's hard time there's over we together

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.219 
it's hard time there's over we together
form<00:04:37.740> you<00:04:38.250> could<00:04:38.550> still<00:04:38.940> hear<00:04:39.270> some<00:04:40.050> of<00:04:40.080> the

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
form you could still hear some of the

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:42.409 
form you could still hear some of the
music<00:04:40.650> from<00:04:40.919> the<00:04:41.280> gym<00:04:41.520> at<00:04:41.700> times<00:04:41.940> I<00:04:42.180> sort<00:04:42.389> of

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
music from the gym at times I sort of

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.570 
music from the gym at times I sort of
quieter<00:04:42.930> moments<00:04:43.080> in<00:04:43.470> music<00:04:43.860> but<00:04:43.979> with<00:04:44.430> these

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
quieter moments in music but with these

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.469 
quieter moments in music but with these
could<00:04:45.510> wouldn't<00:04:45.870> notice<00:04:45.960> it<00:04:46.169> at<00:04:46.320> all<00:04:47.419> on<00:04:48.419> a

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
could wouldn't notice it at all on a

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:49.879 
could wouldn't notice it at all on a
motorbike<00:04:48.810> policy<00:04:49.229> as<00:04:49.289> well<00:04:49.349> that's<00:04:49.650> quite<00:04:49.800> a

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:49.889 
motorbike policy as well that's quite a

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.990 
motorbike policy as well that's quite a
loud<00:04:50.070> thing<00:04:50.510> but<00:04:51.510> with<00:04:51.810> these<00:04:52.020> in<00:04:52.760> it<00:04:53.760> there's

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000
