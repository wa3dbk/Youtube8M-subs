road warrior 2s this is a two channel

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.919 
road warrior 2s this is a two channel
system<00:00:29.460> so<00:00:29.820> it's<00:00:30.000> going<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.240> record<00:00:30.570> video

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
system so it's going to record video

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.100 
system so it's going to record video
both<00:00:31.349> inside<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:31.980> outside<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:33.390> your<00:00:33.630> vehicle

both inside and outside of your vehicle

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.100 
both inside and outside of your vehicle
it<00:00:34.260> does<00:00:34.649> have<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.890> gps<00:00:35.460> antenna<00:00:36.000> as<00:00:36.239> well<00:00:36.750> so

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
it does have a gps antenna as well so

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.619 
it does have a gps antenna as well so
it'll<00:00:37.350> tag<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.800> location<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.520> all<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.360> video

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
it'll tag the location of all the video

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.979 
it'll tag the location of all the video
that<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.469> takes<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:42.000> also<00:00:42.239> is<00:00:42.660> going<00:00:42.930> to

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
that it takes and it also is going to

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.450 
that it takes and it also is going to
work<00:00:43.110> great<00:00:43.410> because<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.829> comes<00:00:44.070> with<00:00:44.160> four

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
work great because it comes with four

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.060 
work great because it comes with four
gigs<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:45.059> SD<00:00:45.510> memory<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.230> can<00:00:46.379> expand<00:00:46.920> it

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
gigs of SD memory so you can expand it

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.880 
gigs of SD memory so you can expand it
using<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.730> larger<00:00:48.120> SD<00:00:48.300> card<00:00:48.870> if<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.320> want<00:00:49.710> to

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
using a larger SD card if you want to

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.979 
using a larger SD card if you want to
but<00:00:50.760> it's<00:00:50.850> going<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.030> tag<00:00:51.239> all<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.690> locations

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
but it's going to tag all the locations

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.479 
but it's going to tag all the locations
along<00:00:52.289> with<00:00:52.559> your<00:00:52.649> video<00:00:52.920> so<00:00:53.100> when<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.309> play
