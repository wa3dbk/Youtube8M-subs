and then see I just
there's<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.500> one<00:00:52.739> shift

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:56.650 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:02.450 

Oh

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:11.380 

made<00:01:03.180> on<00:01:03.300> my<00:01:03.449> buffs<00:01:03.719> my<00:01:04.049> one<00:01:04.379> through<00:01:05.840> zero<00:01:07.909> so

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.450 

and<00:01:11.570> my<00:01:12.050> mounts<00:01:12.410> to<00:01:12.620> put<00:01:12.890> the<00:01:13.010> mounts<00:01:13.310> right

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
and my mounts to put the mounts right

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.480 
and my mounts to put the mounts right
there<00:01:13.670> as<00:01:13.760> well

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
there as well

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.480 
there as well
I<00:01:15.520> just<00:01:16.120> thought<00:01:16.870> that'd<00:01:17.080> be<00:01:17.230> a<00:01:17.260> better<00:01:17.530> thing

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
I just thought that'd be a better thing

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.360 
I just thought that'd be a better thing
so<00:01:18.760> I<00:01:18.880> switched<00:01:19.390> the<00:01:19.660> mouse<00:01:20.440> to<00:01:20.860> numpad

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.370 
so I switched the mouse to numpad

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.200 
so I switched the mouse to numpad
instead<00:01:21.940> of<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:23.530> regular<00:01:23.710> numbers<00:01:24.340> so<00:01:25.150> I

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
instead of the regular numbers so I

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.150 
instead of the regular numbers so I
could<00:01:25.450> do<00:01:25.750> that<00:01:25.960> with<00:01:26.350> the<00:01:26.470> buffs<00:01:26.680> and<00:01:27.040> the

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
could do that with the buffs and the

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.210 
could do that with the buffs and the
mounts<00:01:27.490> I<00:01:27.990> know<00:01:28.990> I<00:01:29.020> like<00:01:29.380> it<00:01:29.410> so<00:01:29.740> far

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
mounts I know I like it so far

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.710 
mounts I know I like it so far
I<00:01:30.250> use<00:01:30.729> only<00:01:30.940> the<00:01:31.120> one<00:01:31.600> through<00:01:31.870> six<00:01:32.170> I<00:01:33.030> got<00:01:34.030> it

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
I use only the one through six I got it

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.350 
I use only the one through six I got it
one<00:01:35.229> two<00:01:35.619> three<00:01:36.130> six<00:01:36.580> five<00:01:36.820> four<00:01:37.090> because<00:01:37.270> I

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
one two three six five four because I

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.740 
one two three six five four because I
think<00:01:37.420> it's<00:01:37.869> easier<00:01:38.260> to<00:01:38.380> hit<00:01:38.670> sixth<00:01:39.670> and<00:01:39.910> four

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
think it's easier to hit sixth and four

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.770 
think it's easier to hit sixth and four
just<00:01:41.470> the<00:01:42.010> way<00:01:42.130> it<00:01:42.220> feels<00:01:42.400> to<00:01:42.550> me

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
just the way it feels to me

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.740 
just the way it feels to me
so<00:01:44.670> this<00:01:45.670> is<00:01:45.820> how<00:01:45.970> I<00:01:46.000> like<00:01:46.210> it<00:01:46.240> nobody<00:01:46.600> here<00:01:46.690> I

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
so this is how I like it nobody here I

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.070 
so this is how I like it nobody here I
got<00:01:46.900> like<00:01:47.110> folks<00:01:47.920> magic<00:01:48.400> shifts<00:01:48.790> one<00:01:49.030> and

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
got like folks magic shifts one and

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.430 
got like folks magic shifts one and
the<00:01:50.560> first<00:01:51.010> shift<00:01:51.280> to<00:01:51.840> shift<00:01:52.840> three<00:01:53.140> is<00:01:53.200> that

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
the first shift to shift three is that

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.480 
the first shift to shift three is that
and<00:01:53.770> then<00:01:53.950> I<00:01:54.220> got<00:01:55.210> this<00:01:55.390> at<00:01:55.600> the<00:01:55.690> alt<00:01:55.960> to<00:01:56.650> 11

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
and then I got this at the alt to 11

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.050 
and then I got this at the alt to 11
shift<00:01:58.360> 11<00:01:58.840> and<00:01:59.080> then<00:01:59.320> 11<00:02:00.040> that's<00:02:00.460> on<00:02:00.700> the<00:02:00.850> Razer

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
shift 11 and then 11 that's on the Razer

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.490 
shift 11 and then 11 that's on the Razer
Naga<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:03.520> I<00:02:03.730> got<00:02:03.880> my<00:02:04.030> auto<00:02:04.390> run<00:02:04.750> walk<00:02:05.020> as<00:02:05.260> my

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500

I'm<00:02:19.760> gonna<00:02:19.940> keep<00:02:20.060> trying<00:02:20.390> that<00:02:20.540> I<00:02:20.600> said<00:02:20.840> it'd

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
I'm gonna keep trying that I said it'd

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.620 
I'm gonna keep trying that I said it'd
be<00:02:20.960> a<00:02:21.020> little<00:02:21.200> easier<00:02:21.290> but<00:02:22.069> so<00:02:22.790> far<00:02:22.970> like<00:02:23.210> it<00:02:23.420> I

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630
