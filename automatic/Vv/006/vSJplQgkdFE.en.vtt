1s2<00:00:23.670> would<00:00:24.060> be<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.750> way<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:25.160> humbuckers

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
1s2 would be the way that humbuckers

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.109 
1s2 would be the way that humbuckers
normally<00:00:26.490> wired<00:00:26.699> in<00:00:26.880> series<00:00:27.170> coil<00:00:28.170> one<00:00:28.380> coil<00:00:28.740> 2

you'll see here you've got it you know
in<00:00:31.710> series<00:00:32.130> what<00:00:32.610> series<00:00:32.640> will<00:00:33.090> look<00:00:33.239> like<00:00:33.390> if

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
in series what series will look like if

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.490 
in series what series will look like if
you<00:00:33.989> want<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.200> do<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.350> parallel<00:00:39.200> we<00:00:40.200> just

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
you want to do it parallel we just

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.610 
you want to do it parallel we just
rewired<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.100> guitar<00:00:41.460> for<00:00:41.790> parallel<00:00:42.440> you<00:00:43.440> want

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
rewired the guitar for parallel you want

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.819 
rewired the guitar for parallel you want
to<00:00:43.710> send<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.040> coil<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.879> out<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.120> phase<00:00:45.829> it's

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
to send this coil to out of phase it's

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:54.410 
to send this coil to out of phase it's
like<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.239> that<00:00:48.239> easy<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.930> program<00:00:53.210> how<00:00:54.210> many

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
like that that easy you program how many

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.080 
like that that easy you program how many
possible<00:00:55.050> combinations<00:00:55.350> are<00:00:56.010> there<00:00:56.090> nine

your<00:01:36.040> two<00:01:36.160> options<00:01:36.190> for<00:01:36.550> bass<00:01:36.760> guitar<00:01:37.570> HH<00:01:38.230> hsh

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
your two options for bass guitar HH hsh

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.970 
your two options for bass guitar HH hsh
piezo<00:01:40.210> no<00:01:40.660> additional<00:01:41.050> cost<00:01:41.110> for<00:01:41.380> the<00:01:41.530> piezo

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:41.980 
piezo no additional cost for the piezo

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.490 
piezo no additional cost for the piezo
no<00:01:42.970> additional<00:01:43.300> cost<00:01:43.360> for<00:01:43.690> the<00:01:43.900> extra<00:01:44.200> single

no additional cost for the extra single

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.550 
no additional cost for the extra single
coil<00:01:44.650> either<00:01:44.860> to<00:01:45.070> go<00:01:45.160> hsh<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:47.110> I<00:01:47.170> think<00:01:47.380> we

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
coil either to go hsh and I think we

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.540 
coil either to go hsh and I think we
ordered<00:01:47.950> all<00:01:48.160> of<00:01:48.490> the<00:01:48.760> all<00:01:49.090> of<00:01:49.150> the<00:01:49.420> above<00:01:49.720> yeah

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
ordered all of the all of the above yeah

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.770 
ordered all of the all of the above yeah
so<00:01:51.550> the<00:01:51.640> perfect<00:01:51.820> base<00:01:52.090> will<00:01:52.300> have<00:01:52.420> one<00:01:52.660> of

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
so the perfect base will have one of

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.219 
so the perfect base will have one of
each<00:01:52.900> that's<00:01:53.650> it<00:01:53.830> awesome<00:01:54.690> so<00:01:55.690> for<00:01:56.110> all<00:01:56.170> you

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
each that's it awesome so for all you

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.620 
each that's it awesome so for all you
tweakers<00:01:56.650> out<00:01:56.800> there<00:01:57.090> no<00:01:58.090> longer<00:01:58.390> do<00:01:58.510> you<00:01:58.540> have

tweakers out there no longer do you have
to<00:01:58.720> have<00:01:58.990> five<00:01:59.380> different<00:01:59.560> bases<00:02:00.070> to<00:02:00.160> get<00:02:00.310> five

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
to have five different bases to get five

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.120 
to have five different bases to get five
different<00:02:00.970> setups<00:02:01.360> it's<00:02:01.930> all<00:02:02.050> in<00:02:02.200> one<00:02:02.380> the
