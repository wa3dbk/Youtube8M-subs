00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.149
 market 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.590
 I have no idea where I'm going. 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.930
 being will always combine between the 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.219
 models to stay in one place all 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.800
 together I know I'll be with 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.210
 other bloggers there but I do not know the 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.670
 People are going to be together all the time. 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.770
 people staying in a secluded place was going to make a 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.010
 I meet everyone I want 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.409
 see people anyway I do not know anything about this 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.080
 there is nothing certain the only thing is that 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.939
 I go, these days, it's for gluttony. 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.310
 gluttony by many stands because it has some 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.640
 specific authors that I want to see 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.860
 It's not that Sandra Cléa was right here. 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.049
 which is that despite having a lot of desire 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.659
 know mainly cassandra eu 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.420
 I'm not in the mood to face queues 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.970
 to pick up tickets stay 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.180
 fights with people at last running 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.939
 lose shoes in that madness 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.090
 I not want to go I'm not so 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:48.329
 do it just to see cassandra clare 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.790
 I'm a fan but I'm not at that level. 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:54.240
 It's still if you're going 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:58.110
 Good luck. For you, go with a lot of faith. 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.390
 run yourself and cherry photos and ask 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.250
 autographs and do that, but I 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.869
 was wandering and for others 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.700
 stands is I will always be 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.860

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:23.880
 I'll put it there but it will not depend 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.680
 of the signal of the 3g is at last that we know 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.230

 So, on my twitter, come on facebook. 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.870
 so the output you enjoy the pages 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.610
 facebook must follow on twitter if 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.290
 You want to know these things when 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.209
 will come to pity 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.100
 but although I want to visit some 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.350
 some books of some 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.480
 authors, I'm going to see more 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.910
 people than necessarily 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.010
 buy books I went on biennial 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:57.180
 paulo two years ago né 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.670
 obviously me and no and I bought 20 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.250
 books like I went there and so are many 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.850
 great album books you have it all from 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.830
 free 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.470
 I went with a friend and it was fun. 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.270
 very fun but I realized that I 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.100
 I spent most of the time hunting 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.350
 books hunting for cheap books 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.200
 Anyway, it's good you buy a book. 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.720
 tasty all this is wonderful knows only 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.060
 that I think I missed a lot of the event 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.820
 because I spent a lot of time buying 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.830
 books that were not so cheap 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.920
 so on the internet so I 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.690
 could wait a while longer to buy 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.150
 internet how it works that has until 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.000
 today that I have not read of the time of the biennial 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.160
 so I'm going to buy books or 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.480
 because it is impossible to go there and get out of there 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.760
 without June 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:46.290
 but I'm not going to do it, I'm not going 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.860
 to go hunting my coaching book 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.690
 God 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.100
 but I will not be hunting book everything 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.799
 How much space, I really want to see. 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:58.410

00:03:52.799 --> 00:04:01.079
 See there you see I'm running or 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.510
 So six were on top of me, and me. 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:06.329
 I'm going to fall, hugged on the floor, rolling 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.670
 so because it's going to be really cool to do 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:10.920
 I 'm going to take lots of pictures and I'm going to give 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.260

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.610

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.940

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:24.750

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.800
 could not stop 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.210

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:01.680
