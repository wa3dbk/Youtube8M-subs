00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.780
Claas Italy is the Italian branch of the manufacturer Claas 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.620
and works in Italy through a network of independent dealers

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.160
companies that are operating in different italian provinces and regions

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.100
as happens in the world of cars and trucks

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.740
when we go into a dealership to buy a car for us

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.200
this is Claas Italia.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.760
Claas Agriculture is nothing more than one of the 40 dealers that Claas has in Italy

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.560
that offers their services to end users, mainly farmers and subcontractors

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.900
operating in the areas where Claas Agriculture has a seat.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.220
Talk about Biomasses in Italy, from my point of view, it is always a little sad

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:29.840
because I think that, as Italian agriculture, we have missed an opportunity to combine to traditional agriculture another source of income for our farmers

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.900
What I regret is seeing the large installations in the hands of industrials

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.080
or people who have invested in this sector considering that revenues were easy

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.720
This area had to remain in the hands of farmers

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:52.560
Farmers had to match their activities a small business related to renewable energy

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
they would have been given to fabric of local society an opportunity for growth

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:09.760
because from the speech of biogas can carry on a conversation of the production chain, greenhouses, food production, in particular climatic conditions

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.880
Unfortunately, today we throw away much of the hot water generated by these installations

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.600
and I think would be a great opportunity to relaunch the Italian agricultural system

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:36.760
we have the opportunity to live in an area where the double production, in spring and autumn, it's feasible

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.800
we are not at the end of this process

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.180
I hope that this process will go ahead

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:52.760
and that from now on, let's go in the direction that other countries, such as Germany and others of Central Europe, are following

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.260
we have to give more importance to our farmers

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.740
and to do so they can have from their work

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.180
the ability to generate higher revenues

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.780
and the ability to generate employment

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.560
 because from biomasses and renewable energy in general

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.194
you can generate employment

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.560
Claas is in Piemonte, because the piedmont has always been the most important agricultural region of Italy

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.160
is a fascinating region because it offers any type of agriculture

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.180
in the north west of the region we have the whole area of ​​rice

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.120
that we all know to be the most important along with the province of Pavia

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:49.300
if we move further west with the provinces of Turin and Cuneo

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.160
 there we have a large production of corn and probably we produce the best corn Italian

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.240
with excellent yields and  very important soils

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.480
then if we go to the south of the region, there are a bit 'of horticulture

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.960
 and there are the areas of the Langhe and Roero, of which we are very proud

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.880
so it is a region that can offer everything from good food to excellent products

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:24.120
and is a region that, logistically, it is a transit route from France and Southern Europe

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.600
and that allows us to export our products all over the world
