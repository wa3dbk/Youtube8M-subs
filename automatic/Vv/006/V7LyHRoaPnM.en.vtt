it<00:02:24.709> it<00:02:25.709> slides<00:02:26.310> over<00:02:26.579> the<00:02:26.910> flesh<00:02:27.360> at<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.600> end

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
it it slides over the flesh at the end

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.780 
it it slides over the flesh at the end
of<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:27.989> fingernail<00:02:28.380> so<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.590> really<00:02:28.790> really

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
of the fingernail so it really really

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.350

so what I what I mean here to clarify is

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:56.780 
so what I what I mean here to clarify is
this<00:02:54.719> motion<00:02:55.290> here<00:02:55.709> the<00:02:55.890> series<00:02:56.280> of<00:02:56.430> motions

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
this motion here the series of motions

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:04.039 
this motion here the series of motions
closed<00:03:00.950> so<00:03:01.950> we'll<00:03:02.549> use<00:03:02.760> that<00:03:02.790> language<00:03:03.180> as<00:03:03.629> we

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049

the boom and that is simply plucking a
string<00:03:30.150> we'll<00:03:30.840> use<00:03:30.959> our<00:03:31.109> third<00:03:31.439> string<00:03:31.859> our

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:32.129 
string we'll use our third string our

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:35.030 
string we'll use our third string our
middle<00:03:32.629> string<00:03:33.629> here<00:03:33.919> plucking<00:03:34.919> a<00:03:35.010> string

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
with the back of that finger now

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.540 
with the back of that finger now
and<00:03:38.380> notice<00:03:39.380> what<00:03:39.620> I<00:03:39.650> did<00:03:39.740> here<00:03:40.190> that<00:03:40.430> is

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
and notice what I did here that is

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:41.980 
and notice what I did here that is

that string it's just like that it's not
a<00:04:32.840> bad<00:04:33.140> idea<00:04:33.169> to<00:04:33.530> get<00:04:33.710> in<00:04:33.830> the<00:04:33.890> habit<00:04:34.100> of

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
a bad idea to get in the habit of

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.590 
a bad idea to get in the habit of
hitting<00:04:36.230> the<00:04:36.530> string<00:04:36.860> and<00:04:37.510> imagining<00:04:38.510> that

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
hitting the string and imagining that

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.650 
hitting the string and imagining that
it's<00:04:38.750> a<00:04:38.840> trampoline<00:04:39.410> that<00:04:39.830> your<00:04:40.490> finger<00:04:40.880> hits

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
it's a trampoline that your finger hits

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.830 
it's a trampoline that your finger hits
it<00:04:42.100> and<00:04:43.100> bounces<00:04:43.790> back<00:04:44.060> up<00:04:44.330> to<00:04:44.540> where<00:04:44.690> we

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
it and bounces back up to where we

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.210 
it and bounces back up to where we
started<00:04:45.260> up<00:04:45.410> here<00:04:45.560> in<00:04:45.680> this<00:04:45.800> position

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
started up here in this position

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.840 
started up here in this position
hovering<00:04:46.610> above<00:04:46.970> the<00:04:47.150> strings<00:04:48.729> if<00:04:49.729> you

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
hovering above the strings if you

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.630 
hovering above the strings if you
thinking<00:04:50.270> that<00:04:50.300> trampoline<00:04:51.050> effect<00:04:51.640> you're

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:52.640 
thinking that trampoline effect you're

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.700 
thinking that trampoline effect you're
thinking<00:04:53.030> that

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
thinking that

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.070 
thinking that
imagery<00:04:55.710> there<00:04:56.330> it'll<00:04:57.330> help<00:04:57.509> you<00:04:57.660> get<00:04:57.870> that

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
imagery there it'll help you get that

imagery there it'll help you get that
motion<00:04:58.349> because<00:04:58.860> we're<00:04:59.099> not<00:04:59.220> playing<00:04:59.580> through

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
motion because we're not playing through

motion because we're not playing through
the<00:05:00.449> string<00:05:00.750> like<00:05:00.960> this

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
the string like this

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.629 
the string like this
we're<00:05:03.840> actually<00:05:04.259> bouncing<00:05:05.099> off<00:05:05.250> the<00:05:05.400> strings

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 
we're actually bouncing off the strings

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.570 
we're actually bouncing off the strings
or<00:05:05.880> giving<00:05:06.270> it<00:05:06.389> a<00:05:06.660> Fleck<00:05:07.500> and<00:05:07.800> we're<00:05:08.160> bouncing

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
or giving it a Fleck and we're bouncing

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.080 
or giving it a Fleck and we're bouncing
up<00:05:08.759> trampoline<00:05:09.330> style<00:05:09.660> so<00:05:09.810> that's<00:05:09.990> our<00:05:10.169> boom

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
up trampoline style so that's our boom

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.700 
up trampoline style so that's our boom
and<00:05:12.090> you<00:05:12.180> can<00:05:12.330> do<00:05:12.449> any<00:05:12.660> string<00:05:13.080> but<00:05:13.349> right<00:05:13.530> now

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
and you can do any string but right now

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:19.610 
and you can do any string but right now
we're<00:05:13.860> using<00:05:13.889> our<00:05:14.160> third<00:05:14.430> string<00:05:16.039> example<00:05:18.620> the

if you're hitting some of the adjacent

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:26.629 
if you're hitting some of the adjacent
strings<00:05:25.889> or<00:05:26.069> you're<00:05:26.220> hitting<00:05:26.430> the<00:05:26.490> wrong

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 
strings or you're hitting the wrong

strings or you're hitting the wrong
string<00:05:27.060> you<00:05:27.180> want<00:05:27.330> to<00:05:27.419> just<00:05:27.539> work<00:05:27.659> on<00:05:27.840> the

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
string you want to just work on the

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.260 
string you want to just work on the
attack<00:05:28.229> and<00:05:29.159> aim<00:05:29.340> for<00:05:29.370> the<00:05:29.639> middle<00:05:29.819> string

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
attack and aim for the middle string

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:35.120 
attack and aim for the middle string
just<00:05:30.509> start<00:05:31.020> working<00:05:31.139> on<00:05:31.409> your<00:05:31.530> accuracy<00:05:34.130> to

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
just start working on your accuracy to

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.779 
just start working on your accuracy to
hit<00:05:35.159> the<00:05:35.430> second<00:05:35.819> string<00:05:36.090> there<00:05:36.330> it's<00:05:36.509> okay<00:05:37.789> so

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:38.789 
hit the second string there it's okay so

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:49.040 
hit the second string there it's okay so
I<00:05:38.880> like<00:05:39.000> work<00:05:39.180> on<00:05:39.389> that<00:05:39.599> trampoline<00:05:47.900> get<00:05:48.900> the

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
I like work on that trampoline get the

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.899 
I like work on that trampoline get the
adjacent<00:05:49.500> strength<00:05:49.830> is<00:05:50.009> okay<00:05:50.430> I'm<00:05:50.610> still

00:05:50.899 --> 00:05:50.909 
adjacent strength is okay I'm still

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:55.089 
adjacent strength is okay I'm still
working<00:05:51.300> my<00:05:51.330> motion<00:05:52.039> put<00:05:53.039> the<00:05:53.159> fourth<00:05:53.430> string

00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:55.099 
working my motion put the fourth string

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:59.969 
working my motion put the fourth string
doesn't<00:05:56.099> matter

00:05:59.969 --> 00:05:59.979 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:01.390 

all<00:06:00.979> right

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
all right

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.129 
all right
practice<00:06:02.150> that<00:06:02.180> till<00:06:02.599> you<00:06:02.660> feel<00:06:02.810> comfortable

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:03.139 
practice that till you feel comfortable

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:05.800 
practice that till you feel comfortable
and<00:06:03.440> then<00:06:03.530> we'll<00:06:03.650> add<00:06:03.830> the<00:06:04.099> next<00:06:04.340> two<00:06:05.240> sets<00:06:05.599> of

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 
and then we'll add the next two sets of

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:13.870 
and then we'll add the next two sets of
motions

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.940
