00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
one is they're both made out of PVC pipe

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.450 
one is they're both made out of PVC pipe
right<00:01:58.560> here<00:01:58.590> by<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:58.979> way<00:02:00.979> this<00:02:01.979> one<00:02:02.250> is

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
right here by the way this one is

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.770 
right here by the way this one is
smoother<00:02:03.619> instead<00:02:04.619> of<00:02:04.680> acrylic<00:02:05.040> paint<00:02:05.219> for

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
smoother instead of acrylic paint for

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.979 
smoother instead of acrylic paint for
the<00:02:07.220> great<00:02:08.220> part<00:02:08.520> I<00:02:08.580> used<00:02:08.819> spray<00:02:09.060> paint<00:02:09.330> so

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
the great part I used spray paint so

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.580 
the great part I used spray paint so
it's<00:02:10.200> shinier<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.679> the

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
it's shinier and the

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.900 
it's shinier and the
edges<00:02:11.920> aren't<00:02:12.340> as<00:02:12.959> smooth<00:02:13.959> as<00:02:14.400> these<00:02:15.400> ones<00:02:15.700> are

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
edges aren't as smooth as these ones are

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.020 
edges aren't as smooth as these ones are
so<00:02:16.840> I<00:02:17.290> think<00:02:17.470> in<00:02:17.890> my<00:02:18.040> opinion<00:02:18.129> that<00:02:18.580> makes<00:02:18.790> it

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
so I think in my opinion that makes it

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:27.650 
so I think in my opinion that makes it
look<00:02:19.239> a<00:02:19.540> little<00:02:19.629> bit<00:02:19.870> better
