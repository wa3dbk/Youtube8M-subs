00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
allegation and I sure as hell hope that

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.830 
allegation and I sure as hell hope that
this<00:02:26.070> isn't<00:02:26.310> some<00:02:26.790> sort<00:02:26.940> of<00:02:27.060> stunt<00:02:27.390> and<00:02:27.600> that

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
this isn't some sort of stunt and that

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.620

or shaming I should say he wasn't raped
and<00:03:11.250> his<00:03:11.340> claim<00:03:11.640> is<00:03:11.790> a<00:03:11.820> grotesque<00:03:12.030> insult<00:03:12.870> to

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.240 
it's a bizarre allegation especially
since<00:03:20.970> it<00:03:21.060> happened<00:03:21.360> so<00:03:21.480> long<00:03:21.690> ago<00:03:21.860> but<00:03:22.860> it's

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
since it happened so long ago but it's

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.090 
since it happened so long ago but it's

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
also not that far-fetched for a huge

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.240 
also not that far-fetched for a huge
celebrity<00:03:26.730> to<00:03:27.209> be<00:03:27.720> in<00:03:27.810> a<00:03:27.930> room<00:03:28.170> and<00:03:28.500> invite<00:03:28.950> any

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
random person in Hollywood to walk into

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.720 
random person in Hollywood to walk into
that<00:03:31.620> room<00:03:31.800> and<00:03:32.010> do<00:03:32.100> whatever<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:32.489> hell<00:03:32.700> they

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
that room and do whatever the hell they

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.759 
that room and do whatever the hell they
want<00:03:33.060> yeah<00:03:33.570> but<00:03:34.140> here's<00:03:34.380> the<00:03:34.440> part<00:03:34.680> that

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
want yeah but here's the part that

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.410 
want yeah but here's the part that
really<00:03:35.370> doesn't<00:03:35.610> make<00:03:35.850> sense<00:03:35.910> to<00:03:36.209> me<00:03:36.300> and<00:03:36.330> I

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
really doesn't make sense to me and I

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.790 
really doesn't make sense to me and I
would<00:03:36.600> say<00:03:36.720> this<00:03:36.840> whether<00:03:37.050> this<00:03:37.110> was<00:03:37.410> a<00:03:37.440> man<00:03:37.650> or

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
would say this whether this was a man or

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.100 
would say this whether this was a man or
a<00:03:37.830> woman<00:03:37.920> yeah

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110
