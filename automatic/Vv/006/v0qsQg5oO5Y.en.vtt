00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.879
 And then people, good beauty for those who do not 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.490
 You know my name is Patricia more. 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.210
 known as psp that I do game 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.400
 place 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.519
 but today I'm going to leave a 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:18.330
 tutorial and for you to conform to 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.070
 and install windows 7 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.590
 I had a very difficult 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:27.470
 great to be able to give the last cd 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:29.640
 so I searched a lot on the internet 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.850
 just a little bit to find but me 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.040
 I found a tutorial from a guy there and he 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.050
 teach me how to do it so i decided to go 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.570
 You're going to leave it here on the channel. 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:44.070
 beauty 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:46.230
 good first'm okay 128 I 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:51.090
 I'll tell you the make and model of the 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:53.850
 my notebook because in different 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:01:02.059
 models to bios is different 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:04.320
 What 's your model's notebook? 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.810
 46 cb 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:12.450
 I'm just here, I know, but I'm fine too. 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:15.600
 It's to start so we can get in. 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:20.100
 in bios its shortcut key is an efect 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.080
 two are pressing the pain or off 2 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.740
 quickly entered the 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.960
 BIOS 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.280
 usually this equation f10 f12 to dell 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:40.110
 finally 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:45.360
 but highlight is the f-22 tries to give the last 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:47.880
 cd but you can see that it has no option and 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.649
 also in this second option here because 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.200
 I'm showing you why we 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.299
 will get into it then there is the 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.939
 The secret is in her too. 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.969
 so here we do not have things to do, okay? 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.280
 So we're going to be abiec donated in my 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.990
 security 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:08.399
 we will disable this option here 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.599
 remembering to tinker with the bios to 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.810
 who do not know 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:17.780
 It's not an alzita, it's the little ones. 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.030
 or less for now we are not alone 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:24.440
 reaches so far here is the little white is 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:31.310
 selecting is no longer an option 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:33.799
 Here, then, why is she here? 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:38.810
 enabled in the games is the inter 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:42.349
 to disable so much here in having exhibitor 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:47.480
 and what we're going to do is push the f10 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:56.319
 it save and restart automatically 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:03:01.810
 It's okay and we will press of 2 again. 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.810
 for him to go back to the bios screen 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.069
 it's not a child 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:29.670
 that we go back to the right bios screen now 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:32.489
 We are going there in Butte. 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.280
 we are here now we are 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.200
 getting access to the second option 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.840
 I remember I could get us now 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:53.700
 so we are getting schematic 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:58.470
 to have and here we will enable the 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:03.569
 options is what we're going to do 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:08.930
 f10 again he save on having here and 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.930
 restart and f2 

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:28.389
 you so the boring mean more is the solution 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.389
 I came to find this tutorial 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:32.800
 I think it's a good thing . 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:37.099
 do this who passes by 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:40.550
 Beauty back to the bios screen 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:41.479
 inlays come again to open other 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:49.879
 options 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:55.219
 right is the option we want the 

00:04:49.879 --> 00:05:02.990
 the tortoise by CD or DVD okay we 

00:04:55.219 --> 00:05:09.409
 have to press the button but it is certain that 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:19.490
 rose to the first option and even 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:24.129
 schema of the other time is f10 inter lonely 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.129
 wait for it to recognize the cd 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.010
 Shit 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:06:02.400
 Oh half recognized the cd disk I picked up 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:04.919
 I lost focus here but I have to 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.020
 recognize the cd and that's it folks 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:11.220
 the focus of the camera is also bad I do not know 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:12.180
 Because it's happening but finally gave 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.930
 right 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:19.500

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.720
 for anyone who has an asus notebook 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:26.760
 I can format it okay. 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:31.220
 look like options read on my set to 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:31.220
 You'll see that it really worked. 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:59.300
 There you go, people again, losing 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.220
 focus 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.750
 I hope you'll forgive me for those 

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:05.780
 bloopers 

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:09.190
 this machine is kind of im configure 

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:10.930

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:13.880
 beauty 

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:19.390
