in that situation it's very stressful

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.609 
in that situation it's very stressful
for<00:01:12.119> them<00:01:12.299> because<00:01:12.479> they<00:01:12.720> begin<00:01:13.049> judging

they are or are not and then they begin

they are or are not and then they begin
projecting<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:22.020> on<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.470> each<00:01:22.619> other<00:01:22.860> so<00:01:23.610> it

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
projecting that on to each other so it

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.880 
projecting that on to each other so it
makes<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.090> very<00:01:24.270> much<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.600> stressful<00:01:25.259> learning

it activates the left brain hemisphere

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.289 
it activates the left brain hemisphere
which<00:01:34.470> is<00:01:34.650> sometimes<00:01:34.979> referred<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.640> as<00:01:36.000> the

so<00:01:39.780> as<00:01:40.110> Einstein<00:01:40.920> said<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.400> cannot<00:01:41.729> solve<00:01:42.060> a

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
so as Einstein said you cannot solve a

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.639 
so as Einstein said you cannot solve a
problem<00:01:42.720> with<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.960> same<00:01:43.200> thinking<00:01:43.590> that

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
problem with the same thinking that

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.160 
problem with the same thinking that
created<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.399> so<00:01:44.430> we're<00:01:44.729> basically<00:01:45.630> raising

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
created it so we're basically raising

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.280 
created it so we're basically raising
kids<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:47.220> recapitulate<00:01:47.729> our<00:01:48.420> mistakes<00:01:49.020> over

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
kids to recapitulate our mistakes over

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.230 
kids to recapitulate our mistakes over
and<00:01:49.560> over<00:01:49.770> again<00:01:50.040> because<00:01:50.369> they<00:01:50.640> don't<00:01:50.939> see

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
and over again because they don't see

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.999 
and over again because they don't see
the<00:01:51.420> ramifications<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.500> choices<00:01:52.979> that

the ramifications of the choices that

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.580 
the ramifications of the choices that
are<00:01:53.130> being<00:01:53.340> made<00:01:53.630> nor<00:01:54.630> do<00:01:54.899> they<00:01:55.020> have<00:01:55.170> adequate

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
are being made nor do they have adequate

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.850 
are being made nor do they have adequate
prefrontal<00:01:56.549> cortex<00:01:57.390> activity<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:58.200> create

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
prefrontal cortex activity to create

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.580 
prefrontal cortex activity to create
novel<00:01:59.219> thoughts<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.329> novel<00:02:00.840> solutions<00:02:01.439> to

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
novel thoughts and novel solutions to

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.880 
novel thoughts and novel solutions to
problems<00:02:02.159> so<00:02:02.880> we<00:02:03.030> end<00:02:03.180> up<00:02:03.360> basically<00:02:03.890> creating

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
problems so we end up basically creating

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.950 
problems so we end up basically creating
a<00:02:04.979> world<00:02:05.219> full<00:02:05.430> of<00:02:05.490> recipe<00:02:06.090> card<00:02:06.360> followers

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
a world full of recipe card followers

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.160 
a world full of recipe card followers
and

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
and

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.169 
and
you<00:02:08.229> look<00:02:08.410> around<00:02:08.770> and<00:02:08.950> look<00:02:09.099> in<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.250> media<00:02:09.670> if

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
you look around and look in the media if

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.699 
you look around and look in the media if
we<00:02:10.240> keep<00:02:10.539> repeating<00:02:10.899> the<00:02:11.110> same<00:02:11.140> mistakes

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
we keep repeating the same mistakes

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.050 
we keep repeating the same mistakes
we've<00:02:11.860> been<00:02:12.010> making<00:02:12.190> for<00:02:12.489> the<00:02:12.610> last<00:02:12.640> several

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
we've been making for the last several

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.210 
we've been making for the last several
hundred<00:02:13.180> years<00:02:13.450> we're<00:02:14.410> probably<00:02:14.739> going<00:02:15.099> to

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
hundred years we're probably going to

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.309 
hundred years we're probably going to
raise<00:02:15.430> a<00:02:15.700> bunch<00:02:15.970> of<00:02:16.090> children<00:02:16.599> that<00:02:16.720> have<00:02:16.959> no

raise a bunch of children that have no
capacity<00:02:18.130> to<00:02:18.730> deal<00:02:19.480> with<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.870> challenges

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
capacity to deal with the challenges

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.640 
capacity to deal with the challenges
that<00:02:20.530> will<00:02:20.709> be<00:02:20.860> facing<00:02:21.130> them<00:02:21.580> so<00:02:22.450> in<00:02:23.080> the

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
that will be facing them so in the

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.140 
that will be facing them so in the
system<00:02:24.040> that<00:02:24.160> I<00:02:24.250> teach<00:02:24.520> one<00:02:24.760> of<00:02:24.819> the<00:02:24.940> most

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
system that I teach one of the most

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.600 
system that I teach one of the most
important<00:02:25.630> things<00:02:25.840> you<00:02:25.989> can<00:02:26.020> do<00:02:26.319> is<00:02:26.500> a<00:02:26.650> seek<00:02:27.340> to

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
important things you can do is a seek to

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.699 
important things you can do is a seek to
get<00:02:27.910> your<00:02:28.060> children<00:02:28.330> into<00:02:28.870> a<00:02:28.900> Steiner<00:02:29.319> school

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
get your children into a Steiner school

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.890 
get your children into a Steiner school
the<00:02:29.950> Waldorf<00:02:30.489> School<00:02:30.790> system<00:02:31.209> in<00:02:31.300> my<00:02:31.450> opinion

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
the Waldorf School system in my opinion

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.410 
the Waldorf School system in my opinion
is<00:02:32.319> the<00:02:32.380> best<00:02:32.680> school<00:02:33.250> system<00:02:33.760> in<00:02:33.940> the<00:02:34.180> world

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
is the best school system in the world

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.140 
is the best school system in the world
and<00:02:34.810> Steiner<00:02:35.560> built<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.100> system<00:02:36.310> so<00:02:36.970> that

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
and Steiner built the system so that

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.170 
and Steiner built the system so that
kids<00:02:37.450> learn<00:02:37.900> through<00:02:38.500> stories<00:02:39.160> through<00:02:39.790> art

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
kids learn through stories through art

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.990 
kids learn through stories through art
through<00:02:41.050> dance<00:02:41.410> through<00:02:41.800> play<00:02:42.550> through

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
through dance through play through

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.720 
through dance through play through
acting<00:02:43.600> through<00:02:44.080> arts<00:02:44.380> and<00:02:44.530> crafts<00:02:44.950> there's

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
acting through arts and crafts there's

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.240 
acting through arts and crafts there's
minimal<00:02:46.209> reading<00:02:46.780> until<00:02:47.049> the<00:02:47.230> left<00:02:47.950> brain

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
minimal reading until the left brain

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.850 
minimal reading until the left brain
naturally<00:02:49.090> grows<00:02:49.810> and<00:02:50.049> develops<00:02:50.230> and<00:02:50.650> comes

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
naturally grows and develops and comes

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.320 
naturally grows and develops and comes
online<00:02:51.069> which<00:02:51.610> is<00:02:51.790> really<00:02:52.500> around<00:02:53.500> 9<00:02:54.430> to<00:02:54.850> 10

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
online which is really around 9 to 10

online which is really around 9 to 10
years<00:02:55.600> old<00:02:55.840> for<00:02:56.140> most<00:02:56.350> kids<00:02:57.030> so<00:02:58.030> those<00:02:58.510> are

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
years old for most kids so those are

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.160 
years old for most kids so those are
some<00:02:59.190> real<00:03:00.190> concerns<00:03:00.819> other<00:03:01.420> things<00:03:01.870> that<00:03:02.049> you

some real concerns other things that you
can<00:03:02.350> do<00:03:02.530> is<00:03:02.799> let<00:03:03.280> your<00:03:03.400> own<00:03:03.640> child<00:03:04.060> have<00:03:04.390> the

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
across a frog visit the Frog at that

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:45.810 
across a frog visit the Frog at that
point<00:03:44.410> there<00:03:44.560> is<00:03:44.590> no<00:03:44.920> oh<00:03:45.250> you<00:03:45.310> should<00:03:45.519> have

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
point there is no oh you should have

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.660 
point there is no oh you should have
gone<00:03:45.970> faster<00:03:46.720> or<00:03:46.989> we<00:03:47.200> got<00:03:47.410> lost<00:03:47.799> or<00:03:48.310> you<00:03:48.340> should

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
gone faster or we got lost or you should

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.039 
gone faster or we got lost or you should
have<00:03:48.790> done<00:03:48.940> this<00:03:49.180> you<00:03:49.450> should<00:03:49.630> have<00:03:49.660> done<00:03:49.750> that

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
have done this you should have done that

have done this you should have done that
so<00:03:50.769> every<00:03:51.579> opportunity<00:03:51.940> is<00:03:52.420> an<00:03:52.540> opportunity

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
so every opportunity is an opportunity

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:56.099 
so every opportunity is an opportunity
for<00:03:53.170> novel<00:03:54.069> experience<00:03:54.730> novel<00:03:55.269> creation<00:03:55.900> and

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
for novel experience novel creation and

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:59.160
