you can see the original air filter and

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.090 
you can see the original air filter and
carburetor<00:01:23.300> are<00:01:24.300> correct<00:01:24.860> distributor<00:01:25.860> cap

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
carburetor are correct distributor cap

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.660 
carburetor are correct distributor cap
distributor<00:01:27.320> caps<00:01:28.320> everything<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.280> correct

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
distributor caps everything is correct

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.490 
distributor caps everything is correct
on<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:30.030> car<00:01:30.240> even<00:01:30.480> the<00:01:30.570> Acorn<00:01:30.930> nuts<00:01:31.170> on<00:01:31.350> the

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
on this car even the Acorn nuts on the

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.070 
on this car even the Acorn nuts on the
heads<00:01:31.740> are<00:01:32.640> correct<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.870> course<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:34.770> v12<00:01:35.340> engine

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
heads are correct of course a v12 engine

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.260 
heads are correct of course a v12 engine

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
massive engine radiators in great shape

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.150 
massive engine radiators in great shape
so<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.720> chassis<00:01:40.140> is<00:01:40.260> really<00:01:40.590> in<00:01:40.710> great<00:01:40.830> shape

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160

some<00:01:43.560> extra<00:01:43.890> parts<00:01:44.160> for<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.610> just<00:01:44.760> in<00:01:44.940> case

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
some extra parts for it just in case

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.270 
some extra parts for it just in case

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
flywheel ring gear that kind of thing

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.150 
flywheel ring gear that kind of thing
just<00:01:48.000> in<00:01:48.570> case<00:01:48.780> when<00:01:49.050> someone<00:01:49.470> digs<00:01:49.680> into<00:01:50.040> it

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
just in case when someone digs into it

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.630 
just in case when someone digs into it
they<00:01:50.280> can<00:01:50.600> you<00:01:51.600> know<00:01:51.660> if<00:01:51.750> they<00:01:51.870> find<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.140> problem

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
they can you know if they find a problem

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.400 
they can you know if they find a problem
transmission<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.880> three-speed<00:01:54.330> and<00:01:54.780> seems

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.410 
transmission is a three-speed and seems

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:56.990 
transmission is a three-speed and seems
to<00:01:55.560> be<00:01:55.680> fine<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.190> shifts<00:01:56.490> through<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.730> gears

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
to be fine it shifts through the gears

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.390 
to be fine it shifts through the gears
never<00:01:57.780> run<00:01:58.020> this<00:01:58.200> carb<00:01:58.470> never<00:01:58.710> tried<00:01:58.980> to<00:01:59.100> start

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
never run this carb never tried to start

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.330 
never run this carb never tried to start
it<00:02:00.140> I've<00:02:01.140> had<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.470> in<00:02:01.500> collection<00:02:01.980> for<00:02:02.160> a<00:02:02.190> while

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
it I've had it in collection for a while

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.640 
it I've had it in collection for a while
and<00:02:02.700> just<00:02:02.910> decided<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.420> too<00:02:04.320> many<00:02:04.470> other

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
and just decided that too many other

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:24.590 
and just decided that too many other
projects<00:02:05.100> so<00:02:22.970> this<00:02:23.970> gives<00:02:24.240> you<00:02:24.360> a<00:02:24.390> good<00:02:24.570> idea

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
projects so this gives you a good idea

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.680 
projects so this gives you a good idea
of<00:02:25.170> how<00:02:25.459> original<00:02:26.459> this<00:02:26.850> car<00:02:27.090> is<00:02:27.300> and<00:02:27.570> how

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
of how original this car is and how

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.220 
of how original this car is and how
complete<00:02:28.110> it<00:02:28.260> is<00:02:28.410> look<00:02:28.650> at<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:30.020> starter<00:02:31.020> a

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
complete it is look at the starter a

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.210 
complete it is look at the starter a
generator<00:02:33.770> water<00:02:34.770> pump

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
generator water pump

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.790 
generator water pump
just<00:02:36.209> in<00:02:36.360> I<00:02:36.690> don't<00:02:37.230> think<00:02:37.380> it's<00:02:37.470> ever<00:02:37.620> been

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
just in I don't think it's ever been

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.320 
just in I don't think it's ever been
apart<00:02:38.100> I<00:02:38.280> don't<00:02:38.459> think<00:02:38.640> anyone's<00:02:38.940> ever<00:02:39.030> had

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
apart I don't think anyone's ever had

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.960 
apart I don't think anyone's ever had
this<00:02:39.480> engine<00:02:39.780> apart<00:02:40.520> now<00:02:41.520> it's<00:02:41.670> just<00:02:41.790> in

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
this engine apart now it's just in

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.990 
this engine apart now it's just in
really<00:02:42.239> great<00:02:42.510> shape<00:02:42.950> and<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.489> whole<00:02:44.730> chassis

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
really great shape and the whole chassis

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.760 
really great shape and the whole chassis
is<00:02:45.270> that<00:02:45.450> way<00:02:45.600> it's<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:45.930> really<00:02:46.350> a<00:02:46.380> rust-free

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
is that way it's a really a rust-free
