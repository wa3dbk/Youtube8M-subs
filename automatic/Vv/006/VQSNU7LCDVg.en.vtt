00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:08.689
 reiterated 

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:12.619
 raid 0 systems are also often called sets or volumes 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:16.299
 divided since at this level the information is divided among all the 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:18.220
 discs that make up the arrangement 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.529
 to store the information it is divided into small parts and is the 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.399
 controller card which gives the relevant size distributing them 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:27.919
 between the discs 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:32.189
 the advantage is to improve its performance and give more speed because the data is 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.040
 write simultaneously on all discs 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.030
 applications like multimedia video games are the beneficiaries 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.140
 where good performance is desired and integrity is not very important 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.960
 Among its disadvantages is that the reliability of this solution is very 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:47.640
 low 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.270
 if one of the disks fails 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.760
 the information is definitely lost 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.790
 does not use parity control redundancy my spare disk 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.980
 At least two discs are required 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.100
 raid 1 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.780
 is the well-known mirror raid mirroring 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.120
 this system makes an exact copy of the data on two or more discs 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.420
 this type of information storage offers a redundancy 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.440
 total that in practice means that if one of the discs fails 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.270
 the raid will continue working with the data stored in your mirror without any 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.790
 loss of information 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.960
 when behaving as a single disc the performance does not improve but if it is 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.770
 reading time is considerably reduced as the sectors to 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.990
 search can be divided between discs by raising the rate of 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.080
 transfer 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.040
 among its advantages is high availability 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.610
 fault tolerance and good performances 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.800
 its high cost is advantage 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.060
 reig 5 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.220
 this level of ramirez known as written in buy and distributed already 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.820
 that the information is distributed in blocks like raitt 0 but a block of 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.910
 each disc is dedicated to parity 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.220
 has an improved mechanism for calculating parity 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.640
 this benefits readings deeds small deportations of information 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.950
 This level is appropriate in multi-user systems where performance is not a 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.750
 critical factor but reliability is required 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.009
 minimum three discs are required 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.429
 as an advantage it is the most used information protection scheme 

00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:15.389
 commonly since it provides a good overall performance with a minimum 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:16.879
 loss of capacity 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:20.610
 also the system has enough redundancy to be fault tolerant 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:24.589
 and as disadvantages it presents lower benefits than in ralito 1 

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:28.349
 does not propose a solution to the simultaneous failure in two discs 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:29.869
 raich 0 +1 

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:34.079
 is a mouse used to replicate and share data between multiple disks 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:38.959
 the difference between a raid 0 +1 and a fast 1-0 is the location of each 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.209
 rayet level within the final set 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.329
 a raid 0 + 1 is a mirror of divisions 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:48.249
 among its advantages is implemented as a symmetric matrix whose segments 

00:02:48.249 --> 00:02:50.269
 they are matrices reiterated 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.349
 excellent solution for sites that need high performance 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.249
 but do not worry about achieving maximum reliability 

00:02:57.249 --> 00:03:00.719
 and among its disadvantages is its high cost and limited scalability 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.069
 rayet 1-0 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.449
 he is also known as king 10 

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:09.119
 Some points to consider is that a minimum of four discs is required 

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:13.899
 It has an excellent performance since the blocks are striped redundancy 

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:17.009
 this is excellent because the blocks are reflected 

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:21.269
 if you want to use some mission-critical application especially for 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.039
 databases this should be the best option 

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:28.099
 one of its advantages is that it is implemented as a divided matrix whose segments 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:29.829
 are root matrices of one 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:32.959
 it also has the same fault tolerance gerrard one 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.839
 its high cost and the reduction of its performance this because the 

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:38.749
 units must move in parallel 

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:40.439
 they are pointed out as disadvantages
