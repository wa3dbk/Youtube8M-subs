00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.150 
when you're absent about in the
mountains<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:07.080> weather<00:00:07.259> can<00:00:07.440> change<00:00:07.470> very

mountains the weather can change very

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.640 
mountains the weather can change very
quickly<00:00:08.250> indeed<00:00:08.880> so<00:00:09.630> it's<00:00:09.780> essential<00:00:10.349> to<00:00:10.380> be

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650

miles<00:00:36.030> an<00:00:36.210> hour<00:00:36.329> won't<00:00:36.630> knock<00:00:36.809> walkers<00:00:37.230> off

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
miles an hour won't knock walkers off

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.650
