hi this is giving you a pretty good look
at<00:00:03.750> the<00:00:04.020> unboxing<00:00:04.950> of<00:00:05.009> the<00:00:05.430> fizz<00:00:05.759> get<00:00:06.230> home

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
at the unboxing of the fizz get home

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.049 
at the unboxing of the fizz get home
station<00:00:07.560> so<00:00:08.250> this<00:00:08.429> is<00:00:08.460> what<00:00:08.639> you<00:00:08.760> get<00:00:08.880> in<00:00:09.000> the

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
station so this is what you get in the

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.390 
station so this is what you get in the
box<00:00:09.090> I<00:00:09.660> kind<00:00:10.050> of<00:00:10.170> took<00:00:10.320> it<00:00:10.380> out<00:00:10.559> beforehand<00:00:11.309> to

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
box I kind of took it out beforehand to

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.030 
box I kind of took it out beforehand to
get<00:00:11.550> an<00:00:11.639> idea<00:00:11.870> but<00:00:12.870> you<00:00:13.259> get<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.530> the

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
get an idea but you get the the

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.880 
get an idea but you get the the
regulator<00:00:14.490> here<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.030> then<00:00:15.420> you<00:00:15.570> get<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:16.020> the

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
regulator here and then you get the the

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.680 
regulator here and then you get the the
bulb<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.369> cartridge<00:00:17.789> that<00:00:17.820> goes<00:00:18.150> into<00:00:18.420> the

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
bulb the cartridge that goes into the

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.349 
bulb the cartridge that goes into the
Fisk<00:00:18.900> is<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.830> then<00:00:20.369> you've<00:00:20.520> got<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:21.000> the

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
Fisk is and then you've got the the

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.240 
Fisk is and then you've got the the
small<00:00:21.630> lead<00:00:21.840> that<00:00:22.080> goes<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.560> it<00:00:22.680> so<00:00:22.949> what<00:00:23.130> we're

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
small lead that goes to it so what we're

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.410 
small lead that goes to it so what we're
going<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.430> do<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:23.789> kind<00:00:23.939> of<00:00:24.090> follow<00:00:24.269> the

you'll<00:00:30.000> see<00:00:30.179> what<00:00:30.359> happens<00:00:30.750> on<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.050> inside

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
you'll see what happens on the inside

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.360 
you'll see what happens on the inside
that<00:00:32.600> you<00:00:33.600> just<00:00:33.829> assemble<00:00:34.829> this<00:00:34.950> you<00:00:35.160> want<00:00:35.309> to

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
that you just assemble this you want to

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.440 
that you just assemble this you want to
make<00:00:35.489> sure<00:00:35.520> you<00:00:35.760> have<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:35.969> assemble

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
make sure you have you assemble

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.630 
make sure you have you assemble
everything<00:00:36.690> as<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.829> instruction<00:00:38.370> showed

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
everything as the instruction showed

tubing<00:01:22.300> to<00:01:22.720> the<00:01:22.750> barb<00:01:27.300> then<00:01:28.300> you<00:01:28.450> should<00:01:28.660> be

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
tubing to the barb then you should be

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.840 
tubing to the barb then you should be
able<00:01:28.900> to<00:01:29.170> attach<00:01:29.500> the<00:01:29.530> regulator<00:01:30.220> to<00:01:30.580> the

paintball and here's the paintball it's

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
paintball and here's the paintball it's
a<00:01:33.820> 20-ounce<00:01:34.270> paintball<00:01:36.120> canister<00:01:37.120> costs

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
a 20-ounce paintball canister costs

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.830 
a 20-ounce paintball canister costs
about<00:01:37.930> 20<00:01:38.380> bucks<00:01:38.530> 22<00:01:39.070> bucks<00:01:39.310> full<00:01:39.840> depends

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
about 20 bucks 22 bucks full depends

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.960 
about 20 bucks 22 bucks full depends
where<00:01:41.080> you<00:01:41.230> are<00:01:41.260> and<00:01:41.680> then<00:01:42.430> I<00:01:42.580> guess<00:01:42.790> we<00:01:42.940> just

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
where you are and then I guess we just

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.640 
where you are and then I guess we just
take<00:01:43.600> this<00:01:43.750> and<00:01:43.930> put<00:01:44.080> it<00:01:44.170> on<00:01:44.290> this<00:01:44.500> will

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
take this and put it on this will

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.510 
take this and put it on this will
automatically<00:01:45.190> push<00:01:45.550> down<00:01:45.760> the<00:01:45.790> pin<00:01:46.210> and

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
automatically push down the pin and

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.650 
automatically push down the pin and
pressurize<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:48.729> system<00:01:48.760> so<00:01:49.240> let's<00:01:49.420> see<00:01:49.540> what

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.660 
pressurize the system so let's see what

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:55.980 
pressurize the system so let's see what
happens<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:55.030> instructions<00:01:55.510> say<00:01:55.570> to<00:01:55.690> make

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
happens the instructions say to make

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.370 
happens the instructions say to make
sure<00:01:56.200> not<00:01:56.470> to<00:01:56.530> cross<00:01:56.920> thread<00:01:56.979> this<00:01:57.520> and<00:01:58.380> that

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
sure not to cross thread this and that

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.140 
sure not to cross thread this and that
as<00:01:59.500> you<00:01:59.590> get<00:01:59.770> a<00:01:59.800> little<00:01:59.979> bit<00:02:00.190> closer<00:02:00.430> down<00:02:00.820> to

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
as you get a little bit closer down to

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.710 
as you get a little bit closer down to
it<00:02:01.330> as<00:02:01.540> it<00:02:01.990> depresses<00:02:02.590> the<00:02:02.850> pin<00:02:03.850> it's<00:02:04.450> going<00:02:04.660> to

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
it as it depresses the pin it's going to

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.749 
it as it depresses the pin it's going to
pressurize<00:02:05.619> the<00:02:05.890> regulator<00:02:06.430> and<00:02:06.580> make<00:02:06.729> a

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
pressurize the regulator and make a

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.710 
pressurize the regulator and make a
little<00:02:06.940> harder<00:02:07.330> to<00:02:08.670> push<00:02:09.670> down<00:02:09.700> total<00:02:10.540> there

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
little harder to push down total there

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.620 
little harder to push down total there
is<00:02:10.929> it<00:02:11.050> just<00:02:11.260> started<00:02:11.560> pushing<00:02:11.740> and<00:02:12.640> I<00:02:13.420> didn't

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
is it just started pushing and I didn't

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.540 
is it just started pushing and I didn't
hear<00:02:13.810> anything<00:02:14.050> but<00:02:16.200> we<00:02:17.200> got<00:02:17.470> we<00:02:18.100> have<00:02:18.220> co2

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
hear anything but we got we have co2
