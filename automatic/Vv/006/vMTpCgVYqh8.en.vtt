 for 30,000 coins in heavy 122 always 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.719
 a good setup that goes to you 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.549
 have to sell for the 36,000 coins 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:23.579
 we're just a second in shape here 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.020
 Anyone who has bought for 24,000 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:27.390
 coins he is not really a good one 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.530
 setup so we go before him 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.700
 for 29 sales or thirty I mean 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.840
 everything if you are not yet on stems 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.520
 it will be how more can be 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.499
 but it wasn't really one 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.479
 good setup and have jtl to 

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:40.350
 players we start with him in shape 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.659
 wilmer 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.679
 in the front right and right video so always 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.840
 worth 24250 and have bought for more 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:50.939
 we do not go and sell of course 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.939
 more we always want minimal 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.670
 slide about that 5k that 5000 coins 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.350
 margins and finally we try 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.179
 we have the 30,000 course seller here 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.969
 put again you realize in center weather 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:04.439
 so that is from tin and centimeters then 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.079
 it is also worth a little more 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.539
 bought for 28 750 and we are going to try 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.090
 often also for 35000 coins and download 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.100
 via 122 and this is therefore slightly less 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.600
 information we sharps for us 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.680
 the form that I bought in for 50 to 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.230
 1000 coins 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.930
 I was a minor mistake 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.459
 at the end because I actually leave one 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.590
 another sharp see who is sold but 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.049
 that now we will see how 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.180
 We can do about 30,000 coys 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:31.730
 next players we have it are 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.159
 in another set of bus cats management 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.370
 have centimeter 4231 from cor for 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:39.650
 30,000 coins and we are leading again 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.599
 for some more seller make natural 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.190
 all pair who enjoy watching how 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.709
 can send sales or 1000 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.150
 conic thousand consume the previous one 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.700
 and all the goodies will be for sale is longer 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.310
 last but ok who you have an idea 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.780
 and this is the best in a cdm 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.430
 position is also in a good position for me 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.840
 setup 4222 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.700
 so we can sell more we go 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.950
 sell 32,000 coins 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.329

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.590
 quapi year ella inlay ca and he is this 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:08.150
 so a good setup can therefore 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.220
 we are not for very cheap 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.250
 but we still have that 5000 could 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.010
