hit<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.960> ground<00:01:37.170> was<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.799> fastest<00:01:38.280> I've<00:01:38.430> ever

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
hit the ground was the fastest I've ever

him<00:01:44.600> is<00:01:45.600> how<00:01:45.869> well<00:01:46.229> I<00:01:46.590> was<00:01:46.770> into<00:01:47.220> our<00:01:47.340> dummy

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
him is how well I was into our dummy

him is how well I was into our dummy
with<00:01:48.930> almost<00:01:49.820> 3,300<00:01:50.820> pounds<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.299> force<00:01:51.920> one<00:01:52.920> of

the biggest hits we've ever measured in
the<00:01:56.100> lab<00:01:58.310> question<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.430> if<00:01:59.759> I<00:01:59.939> were<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.180> just

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
the lab question is if I were to just
