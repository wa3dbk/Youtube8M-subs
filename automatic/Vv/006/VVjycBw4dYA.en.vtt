overextended you're going to become so

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.079 
overextended you're going to become so
usually<00:01:02.350> what<00:01:02.500> what<00:01:03.040> you<00:01:03.190> can<00:01:03.430> do<00:01:03.640> is<00:01:03.879> you<00:01:04.059> just

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
usually what what you can do is you just

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.240 
usually what what you can do is you just
start<00:01:04.750> from<00:01:04.839> the<00:01:04.960> top<00:01:05.199> and<00:01:07.920> push<00:01:08.920> your<00:01:09.130> way

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.460 

and<00:01:14.730> then<00:01:15.120> what<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.540> can<00:01:15.570> do<00:01:15.870> is<00:01:16.020> kind<00:01:16.380> of

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
and then what you can do is kind of

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.470 
and then what you can do is kind of
shift<00:01:16.770> your<00:01:16.950> position<00:01:17.400> more<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.760> the<00:01:17.850> side<00:01:18.120> and

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:18.480 
shift your position more to the side and

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.740 
shift your position more to the side and

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
then just continue the wood the rest of

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.780 
then just continue the wood the rest of
the<00:01:21.840> way<00:01:21.930> down

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790

is<00:02:48.090> you're<00:02:49.010> not<00:02:50.010> a<00:02:50.040> lot<00:02:50.280> you're<00:02:50.670> can<00:02:51.390> you<00:02:51.510> put<00:02:51.750> a

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
is you're not a lot you're can you put a

00:02:51.930 --> 00:03:01.740 
is you're not a lot you're can you put a
lot<00:02:52.110> of<00:02:52.170> pressing<00:02:53.040> down<00:02:53.340> this<00:02:53.549> way

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.640 

again<00:03:02.410> the<00:03:02.560> same<00:03:02.770> problem<00:03:03.340> especially<00:03:04.180> with

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
again the same problem especially with

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.010 
again the same problem especially with
taller<00:03:05.650> patients<00:03:06.340> further<00:03:07.270> down<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.840> back

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
taller patients further down the back

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.620 
taller patients further down the back
you<00:03:08.200> get<00:03:08.380> the<00:03:08.820> more<00:03:09.820> you're<00:03:09.970> going<00:03:10.090> to<00:03:10.210> over

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
you get the more you're going to over

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:16.650 
you get the more you're going to over
Stan<00:03:11.050> arms<00:03:11.470> feel<00:03:11.740> yeah<00:03:12.280> so<00:03:14.250> um<00:03:15.250> so<00:03:15.610> you<00:03:16.420> know

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
Stan arms feel yeah so um so you know

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.840 
Stan arms feel yeah so um so you know
you<00:03:16.810> can<00:03:17.080> go<00:03:17.110> from<00:03:17.470> the<00:03:17.620> side<00:03:17.860> here<00:03:18.250> this<00:03:18.820> this

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
you can go from the side here this this

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.699 
you can go from the side here this this
does<00:03:19.360> become<00:03:19.750> awkward<00:03:19.990> if<00:03:20.320> you're<00:03:20.470> doing

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
does become awkward if you're doing

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.940 
does become awkward if you're doing
bilateral<00:03:21.900> pressing<00:03:22.900> because<00:03:23.350> you<00:03:23.560> know<00:03:23.680> your

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
bilateral pressing because you know your

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.699 
bilateral pressing because you know your
arms<00:03:24.340> are<00:03:24.430> not<00:03:24.580> even<00:03:25.180> I<00:03:25.420> hate<00:03:25.959> to<00:03:26.110> see<00:03:26.350> what's

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709

arms are not even I hate to see what's
five<00:03:26.980> federal<00:03:27.310> bilateral<00:03:28.240> both<00:03:28.600> both<00:03:28.870> sides

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
five federal bilateral both both sides

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.620 
five federal bilateral both both sides
in<00:03:29.590> one<00:03:29.800> time<00:03:30.100> yeah<00:03:30.310> yeah<00:03:33.000> you<00:03:34.000> know<00:03:34.120> if<00:03:34.209> this

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
in one time yeah yeah you know if this

in one time yeah yeah you know if this
really<00:03:34.959> feels<00:03:35.110> uncomfortable<00:03:35.830> you<00:03:35.980> can

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
really feels uncomfortable you can

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.550 
really feels uncomfortable you can
always<00:03:36.489> do<00:03:36.790> like<00:03:37.030> one<00:03:37.420> side<00:03:37.690> at<00:03:37.870> a<00:03:37.959> time<00:03:37.989> this

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
always do like one side at a time this

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:52.490 
always do like one side at a time this
way<00:03:39.090> impressing<00:03:40.090> the<00:03:40.330> palm

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:04:00.320 

things<00:03:53.500> kind<00:03:53.830> of<00:03:53.920> symmetrical

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.630 

again<00:04:00.930> I<00:04:00.960> have<00:04:01.260> a<00:04:01.290> dominant<00:04:01.830> hand<00:04:02.490> my<00:04:02.610> right

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
again I have a dominant hand my right

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.490 
again I have a dominant hand my right
hand<00:04:03.090> prefers<00:04:03.630> to<00:04:03.840> do<00:04:04.020> more<00:04:04.230> of<00:04:04.350> the

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
hand prefers to do more of the

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.070 
hand prefers to do more of the
depressing<00:04:05.130> but<00:04:05.480> pressing<00:04:06.480> is<00:04:06.720> something

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
depressing but pressing is something

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:14.850 
depressing but pressing is something
that<00:04:07.200> is<00:04:07.950> pretty<00:04:08.280> easy<00:04:08.580> so<00:04:09.000> both<00:04:09.330> hands<00:04:09.630> could

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.710 

now<00:04:15.430> in<00:04:15.760> the<00:04:15.850> notes<00:04:16.060> i<00:04:16.239> mentioned<00:04:16.630> that

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
now in the notes i mentioned that

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.180 
now in the notes i mentioned that
there's<00:04:16.930> another<00:04:17.170> kind<00:04:17.410> of<00:04:17.560> pressing<00:04:18.010> that

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
there's another kind of pressing that

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.360 
there's another kind of pressing that
you<00:04:18.310> can<00:04:18.489> do<00:04:18.670> this<00:04:19.239> is<00:04:19.829> they<00:04:20.829> call<00:04:21.010> it's<00:04:21.190> like

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
you can do this is they call it's like

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.990 
you can do this is they call it's like
spinal<00:04:21.820> trusting<00:04:22.590> you<00:04:25.200> but<00:04:26.200> with<00:04:26.530> one<00:04:26.740> hand

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
spinal trusting you but with one hand

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.760 
spinal trusting you but with one hand
you<00:04:28.000> make<00:04:28.420> a<00:04:28.450> split<00:04:28.840> between<00:04:29.020> your<00:04:29.320> middle<00:04:29.500> and

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
you make a split between your middle and

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.550 
you make a split between your middle and
your<00:04:29.890> index<00:04:30.160> finger<00:04:30.580> this<00:04:30.790> way<00:04:30.970> and<00:04:31.270> then<00:04:31.900> you

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
your index finger this way and then you

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.860 
your index finger this way and then you
know<00:04:32.650> you<00:04:32.710> never<00:04:33.130> want<00:04:33.400> to<00:04:33.460> press<00:04:33.670> directly<00:04:34.660> on

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
know you never want to press directly on

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.800 
know you never want to press directly on
the<00:04:35.050> spine<00:04:35.760> but<00:04:36.760> this<00:04:36.850> is<00:04:37.030> a<00:04:37.060> way<00:04:37.270> where<00:04:37.690> you

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
the spine but this is a way where you

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:44.280 
the spine but this is a way where you
you<00:04:38.260> can<00:04:39.240> almost<00:04:40.240> do<00:04:40.720> that<00:04:40.930> ok<00:04:42.660> so<00:04:43.660> the<00:04:44.050> spine

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
you can almost do that ok so the spine

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.900 
you can almost do that ok so the spine
itself<00:04:44.500> is<00:04:45.630> between<00:04:47.190> my<00:04:48.190> index<00:04:48.640> and<00:04:48.820> middle

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
itself is between my index and middle

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.350 
itself is between my index and middle
finger<00:04:49.419> here<00:04:49.690> and<00:04:50.520> my<00:04:51.520> other<00:04:51.730> hand<00:04:52.030> is<00:04:52.180> just

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
finger here and my other hand is just

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.860 
finger here and my other hand is just
going<00:04:52.600> to<00:04:52.690> apply<00:04:52.990> pressure<00:04:53.290> on<00:04:53.800> to<00:04:54.780> you<00:04:55.780> know

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.390 
on to this this poem right onto the

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.480 
on to this this poem right onto the
fingers<00:04:58.750> here

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
fingers here

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.550 
fingers here
and<00:05:01.419> I'm<00:05:01.599> not<00:05:01.750> you<00:05:01.990> know<00:05:02.020> I'm<00:05:02.139> not<00:05:02.319> pressing

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
and I'm not you know I'm not pressing

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.860 
and I'm not you know I'm not pressing
further<00:05:03.370> up<00:05:03.669> here<00:05:03.970> I'm<00:05:04.150> pressing<00:05:04.539> right<00:05:04.690> on

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
further up here I'm pressing right on

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.559 
further up here I'm pressing right on
the<00:05:04.990> fingers<00:05:05.460> I'm<00:05:06.460> just<00:05:06.580> pressing<00:05:06.849> and<00:05:07.180> the

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:07.569 
the fingers I'm just pressing and the

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:09.809 
the fingers I'm just pressing and the
fingers<00:05:07.930> are<00:05:08.139> just<00:05:08.319> pressing<00:05:08.740> right<00:05:09.310> next<00:05:09.729> to

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:09.819 
fingers are just pressing right next to

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:19.700 
fingers are just pressing right next to
the<00:05:09.970> spine<00:05:10.270> and<00:05:10.740> you<00:05:11.740> can<00:05:11.919> just

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.410 

personally<00:05:20.550> I<00:05:20.610> think<00:05:20.640> it's<00:05:20.970> more<00:05:21.030> effective

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:21.420 
personally I think it's more effective

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:30.910 
personally I think it's more effective
if<00:05:21.750> you<00:05:21.900> go<00:05:22.160> the<00:05:23.160> other<00:05:23.190> way<00:05:23.600> makaha<00:05:24.600> show

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:30.920 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.010 

but<00:05:31.520> instead<00:05:31.880> of<00:05:32.120> going<00:05:32.420> from<00:05:32.600> the<00:05:32.780> top<00:05:32.810> down

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020 
but instead of going from the top down

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:39.970 
but instead of going from the top down
this<00:05:33.410> way<00:05:33.710> I<00:05:34.810> like<00:05:35.810> actually<00:05:36.290> going<00:05:36.470> from<00:05:38.980> from

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:39.980 
this way I like actually going from from

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.010 
this way I like actually going from from
below<00:05:40.340> and<00:05:40.730> then<00:05:40.940> doing<00:05:41.150> the<00:05:41.240> same<00:05:41.480> thing<00:05:41.780> so

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
below and then doing the same thing so

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.850 
below and then doing the same thing so
with<00:05:42.140> my<00:05:42.260> palm<00:05:42.790> below<00:05:43.790> this<00:05:44.060> way<00:05:44.440> then<00:05:45.440> it's

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
with my palm below this way then it's

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.190 
with my palm below this way then it's
especially<00:05:46.280> good<00:05:46.580> for<00:05:46.640> about<00:05:47.120> the<00:05:47.480> mid-back<00:05:47.930> a

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:48.200 
especially good for about the mid-back a

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:53.710
