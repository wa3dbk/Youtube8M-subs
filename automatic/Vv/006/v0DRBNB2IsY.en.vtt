00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
make sure the catheter is still in the

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.810 
make sure the catheter is still in the

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.030 
vein and if the vein doesn't have any
problems<00:01:12.330> so<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.140> can<00:01:13.380> hold<00:01:13.590> off<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.890> vein

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
problems so you can hold off the vein

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.380 
problems so you can hold off the vein
like<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.960> watch<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.170> fill<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:17.390> make

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
like this and watch it fill and make

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
sure that the vein fills this horse's

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.929 
sure that the vein fills this horse's
vein<00:01:20.310> isn't<00:01:20.640> filling<00:01:21.890> really<00:01:22.890> well<00:01:23.189> but<00:01:23.759> as

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
vein isn't filling really well but as

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.640 
vein isn't filling really well but as
you<00:01:24.210> can<00:01:24.330> see<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.140> filling<00:01:25.380> when<00:01:25.619> I

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
you can see that it is filling when I

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.140 
you can see that it is filling when I
hold<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:26.009> off<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.430> then<00:01:26.580> let<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.850> go<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.090> you

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
hold it off and then let it go and you

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.649 
hold it off and then let it go and you
can<00:01:27.299> see<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:28.650> distension<00:01:29.159> goes<00:01:29.340> away

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
can see that it the distension goes away

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.140 
can see that it the distension goes away
in<00:01:31.040> addition<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.159> checking<00:01:32.490> for<00:01:32.610> distension

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
in addition to checking for distension

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.910 
in addition to checking for distension

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
because it could be the sign of an

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.510 
because it could be the sign of an
infection<00:04:35.439> and<00:04:35.590> that<00:04:35.949> may<00:04:36.129> need<00:04:36.280> to<00:04:36.400> be

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
infection and that may need to be

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.149 
infection and that may need to be
treated<00:04:36.879> appropriately<00:04:37.740> the<00:04:38.740> other<00:04:38.919> thing

00:04:39.149 --> 00:04:39.159 
treated appropriately the other thing

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:41.850 
treated appropriately the other thing
that<00:04:39.189> could<00:04:39.460> happen<00:04:39.669> is<00:04:40.349> between<00:04:41.349> flushes

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
that could happen is between flushes

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.830 
that could happen is between flushes
sometimes<00:04:42.639> the<00:04:42.789> clot<00:04:43.030> can<00:04:43.210> form<00:04:43.270> at<00:04:43.719> the<00:04:43.810> end

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
sometimes the clot can form at the end

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.179 
sometimes the clot can form at the end
of<00:04:44.020> the<00:04:44.080> catheter<00:04:44.259> and<00:04:44.710> so<00:04:44.860> it<00:04:44.949> can<00:04:45.069> be

00:04:45.179 --> 00:04:45.189 
of the catheter and so it can be

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:48.330 
of the catheter and so it can be
difficult<00:04:45.400> flush<00:04:45.969> if<00:04:46.330> that<00:04:47.169> happens<00:04:47.650> you<00:04:48.129> can

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
difficult flush if that happens you can

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.520 
difficult flush if that happens you can
apply<00:04:48.639> significant<00:04:49.629> pressure<00:04:49.689> when<00:04:50.259> you<00:04:50.349> put
