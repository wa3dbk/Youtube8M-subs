00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.300 
suppose you might actually have thin
hair<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.899> not<00:02:01.049> really<00:02:01.290> even<00:02:01.710> realize<00:02:02.100> you

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
hair and not really even realize you

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.310 
hair and not really even realize you
actually<00:02:02.460> have<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.119> form<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.509> hair<00:02:03.719> loss<00:02:03.750> so<00:02:04.170> how

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
actually have a form of hair loss so how

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.649 
actually have a form of hair loss so how
would<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.619> identify<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:05.729> was<00:02:05.880> hair<00:02:06.420> loss

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
would you identify that it was hair loss

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.430 
would you identify that it was hair loss
well<00:02:07.970> hair<00:02:08.970> grows<00:02:09.300> about<00:02:09.629> half<00:02:09.929> an<00:02:10.110> inch<00:02:10.229> a

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
well hair grows about half an inch a

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.750 
well hair grows about half an inch a
month<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:10.950> it<00:02:11.580> goes<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:11.970> difference<00:02:12.390> there

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
month and it goes to a difference there

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.280 
month and it goes to a difference there
she's<00:02:12.909> a<00:02:12.939> growing<00:02:13.239> phase<00:02:13.599> the<00:02:13.870> resting<00:02:14.260> phase

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
she's a growing phase the resting phase

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.770 
she's a growing phase the resting phase
and<00:02:14.769> then<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:15.459> hair<00:02:15.640> follicle<00:02:16.150> dies<00:02:16.330> and<00:02:16.599> here

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
and then the hair follicle dies and here

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.289 
and then the hair follicle dies and here
comes<00:02:17.019> out<00:02:17.260> so<00:02:17.769> you're<00:02:17.950> naturally<00:02:18.159> losing<00:02:19.090> hey
