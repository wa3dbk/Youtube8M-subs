so<00:00:00.750> we're<00:00:00.930> standing<00:00:01.350> up<00:00:01.530> above<00:00:01.890> the<00:00:02.100> earth<00:00:02.310> and

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:02.810 
so we're standing up above the earth and

a good place to really get an
understanding<00:00:06.890> for<00:00:07.890> how<00:00:08.189> we<00:00:09.030> design<00:00:09.570> them<00:00:09.950> to

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
understanding for how we design them to

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.220 
understanding for how we design them to
fit<00:00:11.190> into<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.580> landscape<00:00:11.910> and<00:00:12.389> to<00:00:12.599> be<00:00:12.750> fully

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
as fully sustainable as we could make

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.790 
as fully sustainable as we could make
them<00:00:16.170> and<00:00:16.970> as<00:00:17.970> you<00:00:18.960> see<00:00:19.080> what<00:00:19.380> you're<00:00:19.560> seeing

winter long the other part that you're

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.310 
winter long the other part that you're
seeing<00:00:41.760> are<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.090> walls<00:00:42.420> these<00:00:42.870> are<00:00:43.050> foot

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
seeing are the walls these are foot

thick straw clay walls been very much

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.709 
thick straw clay walls been very much
compressed<00:00:47.840> the<00:00:48.840> straw<00:00:50.180> creates<00:00:51.180> thermal

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
compressed the straw creates thermal

mass the clay gives a heating effect the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.650 
mass the clay gives a heating effect the
result<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.780> these<00:00:58.620> walls<00:00:58.949> hold<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.969> heat<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.390> a

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
result is these walls hold the heat of a

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.789 
result is these walls hold the heat of a
winter<00:01:00.989> day<00:01:01.230> through<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.460> winter<00:01:02.910> night<00:01:03.799> you're

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
winter day through a winter night you're

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.800 
winter day through a winter night you're
also<00:01:05.010> looking<00:01:05.430> at<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.920> roofs<00:01:08.240> the<00:01:09.240> roofs<00:01:09.510> of

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
also looking at the roofs the roofs of

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.560 
also looking at the roofs the roofs of
both<00:01:10.110> are<00:01:10.439> super<00:01:11.070> insulated<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.240> you're<00:01:12.360> not

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
both are super insulated so you're not

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.320 
both are super insulated so you're not
losing<00:01:12.840> heat<00:01:13.439> through<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.040> roofs<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:15.030> domes

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
losing heat through the roofs the domes

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.140 
losing heat through the roofs the domes
each<00:01:15.750> have<00:01:16.140> not<00:01:16.890> only<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.280> dome<00:01:17.490> but<00:01:17.790> two

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
each have not only the dome but two

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.450 
each have not only the dome but two
plates<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.630> glass<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.799> you're<00:01:19.950> essentially

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
plates of glass so you're essentially

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.660 
plates of glass so you're essentially
going<00:01:20.729> through<00:01:20.970> three<00:01:21.270> plates<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.720> glass

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
going through three plates of glass

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.520 
going through three plates of glass
everything<00:01:23.670> was<00:01:23.880> done<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.750> be<00:01:24.869> ready<00:01:25.170> for<00:01:25.470> a

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
everything was done to be ready for a

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.280 
everything was done to be ready for a
Vermont<00:01:25.979> winter<00:01:26.400> for<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.880> cold<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.450> below

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
Vermont winter for the cold of below

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.929 
Vermont winter for the cold of below
zero<00:01:28.590> temperatures<00:01:29.159> which<00:01:29.400> we<00:01:29.579> do<00:01:29.729> get

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
zero temperatures which we do get

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.289 
zero temperatures which we do get
sometimes<00:01:31.070> the<00:01:32.070> other<00:01:32.189> thing<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.610> happens

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
sometimes the other thing that happens

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.380 
sometimes the other thing that happens
here<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.560> round<00:01:34.829> shape<00:01:35.250> which<00:01:36.060> most

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
here is the round shape which most

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.350 
here is the round shape which most
people<00:01:36.509> don't<00:01:36.750> think<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:37.140> wire<00:01:37.590> round<00:01:37.920> house

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
people don't think of wire round house

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.880 
people don't think of wire round house
one<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.570> big<00:01:39.689> reasons<00:01:39.869> for<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.320> round<00:01:40.650> house

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
one of the big reasons for a round house

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.649 
one of the big reasons for a round house
is<00:01:41.450> the<00:01:42.450> fact<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:43.399> you<00:01:44.399> have<00:01:44.610> less<00:01:45.119> outside

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
is the fact that you have less outside

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.649 
is the fact that you have less outside
area<00:01:46.140> there's<00:01:46.470> less<00:01:46.799> wall<00:01:47.270> so<00:01:48.270> as<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.420> result

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
area there's less wall so as a result

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.230 
area there's less wall so as a result
there's<00:01:49.500> less<00:01:49.740> heat<00:01:49.979> loss<00:01:50.189> so<00:01:51.030> in<00:01:51.149> the

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
there's less heat loss so in the

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.870 
there's less heat loss so in the
wintertime<00:01:51.479> if<00:01:52.350> you're<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.920> round<00:01:53.280> space<00:01:53.610> as

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
wintertime if you're a round space as

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.389 
wintertime if you're a round space as
opposed<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.299> its<00:01:54.509> square<00:01:54.810> space<00:01:55.170> less<00:01:56.130> wall

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
opposed to its square space less wall

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.219 
opposed to its square space less wall
the<00:01:56.700> same<00:01:56.909> with<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.210> roof<00:01:57.390> there's<00:01:57.930> less

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
the same with the roof there's less

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.389 
the same with the roof there's less
roofing<00:01:58.649> material<00:01:59.219> there's<00:01:59.790> less<00:02:01.040> space<00:02:02.040> for

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
roofing material there's less space for

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.760 
roofing material there's less space for
you<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.549> lose<00:02:02.820> heat<00:02:03.149> through<00:02:03.450> so<00:02:04.140> everything

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
you to lose heat through so everything

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.119 
you to lose heat through so everything
has<00:02:04.950> been<00:02:05.100> designed<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:06.119> be<00:02:06.450> as<00:02:07.129> absolutely

the big other big energy efficiency

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.360 
the big other big energy efficiency
is<00:02:13.630> what<00:02:13.900> surrounds<00:02:14.260> you<00:02:14.500> here<00:02:14.650> this<00:02:14.830> forest

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
is what surrounds you here this forest
