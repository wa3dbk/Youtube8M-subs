00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040
 but we continue with mission 44 of gta 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.109
 4 light 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.290
 well this is one of the last missions 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:13.099
 what we do for the French officer marc 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:15.469
 river and we are in the same area or near 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:17.119
 to the good area if it's the same area that 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:19.369
 it's hunting gardens but it's not the same 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.599
 where francis cited us for the first time 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.890
 good time 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:29.419
 As you can see Francis is extremely bitter 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.840
 he's super pissed off because although 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:35.120
 francis commanded us to eliminate a subject 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:39.170
 this guy had an organization is yes 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:42.710
 and had a right arm a second that 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:46.940
 right arm is alive and is about 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:50.180
 to give away to francis that's what he has 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.360
 so so bitter problems for francis 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.700
 true problems but we do not have 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.829
 the guilt or ccoo are not to blame 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.200
 francis command to eliminate a subject and 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:03.020
 that subject was removed and if he had a 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.649
 second is not our fault, but 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.250
 good 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:09.650
 francis is very bitter unique as that 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.490
 is a bit doubtful he does not want to do this 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.399
 written more by 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:17.180
 and to move to the last but good 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:20.330
 then try to convince nico says 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:23.270
 he sells heroin to children by god 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:26.479
 you have to eliminate it good then 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.280
 says three many times but who and who 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.840
 he has nothing to lose the officer is 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.570
 the one who has to wake up 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.719
 well then here comes the question 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.810
 of money how much 5 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:40.860
 the same amount the last time 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.350
 that way you cost yourself saying cis 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:48.000
 well then you already give us details of the 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:51.000
 location of that guy in denver and he 's 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.880
 there as your good barracks your home or your 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.390
 house your apartment then first 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.160
 before going to that apartment where he 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.010
 hold we have to go somewhere else to 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:06.390
 pick up a rifle though then 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:09.240
 we have to go to a car well let's go 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:13.980
 to grab a vehicle a must be on 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:16.800
 taxi that left me there is this mission is 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.500
 super simple is also very easy not 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.470
 there is no risk or anything or you go to 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:28.069
 pass the super fast wherever you go 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:32.799
 niko is that taxi asshole good then 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:36.219
 we go to the vehicle well then 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.219
 let's zoom in 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.670
 and this vehicle is not mandatory that what 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.380
 let's drive yes that is not what you are going to use 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.540
 that vehicle yes or yes no no no no 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.989
 we just have to pick up the 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.240
 ammunition or the rifle and there it is is a 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:54.060
 felsher 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:57.180
 I wanted to jump prey covered in order 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.790
 then we have the moment and now 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.060
 if we go to denver avenue 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.890
 let's give our taxi and go fast 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.930
 until the other zone this mission is 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.269
 pretty easy like that the first time 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.590
 mission that left us francis young boyfriend 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:16.840
 we have to use a rifle anyway 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:19.390
 well then let's wait there is 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.340
 we go to the yellow marker good 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.950
 first of all we call French for um 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.050
 to inform you that we are already in the 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.400
 zone but we are on the site 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.050
 well then it does not say it's 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.390
 hiding the apartment that is in the 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.090
 fourth floor and we have to use the rifle 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.690
 from another from another part so 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.610
 point 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.730
 and it's okay if it's not in the window 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.380
 we have to make it go out the window to 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.810
 the view of us to be able to then 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.280
 remove it so we have to go to the 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.530
 roof of the building in front 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.670
 and then let's go up to the roof 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.730
 or to the roof 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.069
 in this mission it is extremely simple or 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.420
 there is no risk of anything working 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.180
 maderia because there is nothing 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.250
 persecution that is nothing 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:07.490
 confrontation nor help one is quite 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:11.030
 easy yes 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:13.640
 same is the same universal technique yes or 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.860
 whether there are missions that are universal to 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.140
 they have the same theme 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:21.500
 mission development that is another of 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:23.360
 they are well on the roof and there 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.310
 is the window is the apartment of 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.610
 that guy who is looking at the 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.610
 TV 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:35.409
 well there is only one in front and there it is 

00:04:31.809 --> 00:04:39.249
 the apartment is the subject 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:41.800
 finishing the television with marijuana 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:44.739
 on the guy's phone if we do not 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.949
 shows the kinematics what we have to 

00:04:44.739 --> 00:04:50.110
 make the subject come out we can but 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:52.779
 before I will monitor below yes yes no 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.029
 pass the police because sometimes you shoot 

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:58.569
 and the police is there nearby and it's going to 

00:04:55.029 --> 00:05:01.839
 activate a star and better we hoped 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:04.539
 that these dogs get the hell itself 

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:08.139
 well they left and now we can 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:10.749
 choose to shoot the antenna and I chose the 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:13.479
 antenna so choose also shoot 

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:16.780
 to the television or call it is the number that 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:19.210
 it was there and now we're going to eliminate it 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.190
 ciao cabecita and now we have to 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.070
 leaving the roof I do not realize is 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:26.910
 super simple always check that the 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:29.230
 police is not hanging around because 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.610
 land in bad luck to shoot at 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:33.040
 just when the police is there the 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.690
 police is going to ruin logically and 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.120
 is going to create a star level that is 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:39.610
 they are going to come looking for you they will go up 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.350
 where are you and maybe you do not like it 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.210
 a lot then that's why he always watches 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:46.280
 there are no guards or anything down 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:48.560
 that's fine we're outside 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.060
 in this way we are already concluding the 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.790
 mission and this is the reward of the 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:55.400
 5000 large now we call francis 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:06:00.110
 to inform you that everything is 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:02.560
 resolved or be happy if you no longer have 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:05.620
 problems or nothing 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:09.250
 and do not give us sermons or anything like that 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:12.970
 already get away from us good tell us 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:14.500
 that the city improves 1% and that if more 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.360
 people do the same 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.590
 would improve we are one hundred percent good 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.690
 then it is that we are left without a 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.100
 interrogation and the pgje so I hope 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:24.690
 you like this video see you in the 

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.690
 next video if the incoming
