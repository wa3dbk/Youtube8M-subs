 to make delight littlebits or to be 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.250
 cause now you actually have that fusion 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.920
 so the strip will still be called the back of 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.610
 flashbender but this will be the fuse 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.410

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:44.290

 little bit more output from your syrup 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:36.670
 marina we are this mustache all this reflector 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.319
 we can also change into strip light for 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.829
 the neck setup how can a change it into 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:40.829
 strip light 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.490
 it's the strip like this 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.170
 share you can bic another month 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.460

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:58.200
 anyway you your just like can add this 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.640
 to the syrup and this is the luxor 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.130
 nothing assembled 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.050
 so tony takes a few seconds and on 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.460
 location you can really very quickly 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.160
 learn your 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.630
 nothing or box in to strip flight such an old man 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.020
 can save when the syrup and we can 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.740

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.740
 afterwards it becomes 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.720
 well for the sublite hair because my like 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.250
 to be a little bit lower 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:27.100
 with inverse a show you how it 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.100
 looks the same way as to bigger reflector 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:36.180
 and your chance is everyone's not much different 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.060
 it's a little bit more side rest 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:42.060
 they learn white narrower inlite especially in 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:44.430

 sam must normally use it or with users 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:50.729
 longer than your lens 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:52.110
 however in this case be cause i like to 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:54.360
