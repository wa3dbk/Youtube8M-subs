like<00:00:25.260> one<00:00:25.470> second<00:00:25.859> right<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.699> want<00:00:27.240> try<00:00:27.420> and

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
like one second right I want try and

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.099 
like one second right I want try and
make<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.660> like<00:00:27.930> I<00:00:28.050> start<00:00:28.349> stare<00:00:29.720> yeah<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:30.779> don't

think<00:00:31.260> we<00:00:31.349> can<00:00:31.470> do<00:00:31.619> that<00:00:31.910> so<00:00:32.910> it's<00:00:33.300> weird

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
think we can do that so it's weird

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.709 
think we can do that so it's weird
because<00:00:34.340> spin<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.610> actually<00:00:36.030> standing<00:00:36.540> up

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719
