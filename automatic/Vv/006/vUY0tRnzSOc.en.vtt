00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:07.620
 Hello and welcome to 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.300
 show technology teacher in this video 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.460
 I'll tell you how to pay two duals 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.950
 subtracted from each other by the 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.190
 first number with the two complementary 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.869
 added numbers to be repaired if you 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.359
 do not know yet how to pay dual 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.260
 just look at a tutorial 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:30.029
 on this topic and then look at you 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.590
 first the subtraction of dual pay around 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.750
 the route to an example too 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:38.610
 clarify so sad in this video 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.930
 the number 63 - the number eight now so 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.329
 not so hard you can head 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:47.190
 would then have to h55 at 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:49.920
 Comes out in the dual pay system 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.480
 the numbers follow the 63 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:58.640
 just insists on 6 1 - the eight the 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.640
 from a 1 and 3 0 stands 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:06.390
 Now we come to the two compliments 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.070
 two compliments have the reigned value 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.580
 the number of which one is the two 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:15.560
 compliment forms here so that is 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.090
 two compliments of the number eight - 8 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.369
 Of course we also get here clearly 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.409
 why you pay each other 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:27.360
 can subtract by the two 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:34.890
 compliment added because 63 84 by 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:36.869
 the same as 63 plus minus 8 the two 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.040
 Compliment is formed by first 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.110
 even ensures that the 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.140
 subtract de number just as many bits 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.560
 how does the number of the sib become ours 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.170
 63 has 6 bits in this case and ours 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.409
 eight only four bits so we just add 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.540
 20 more 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:58.520
 at the eight, and these two zeros 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.520
 are then appended to the far left so 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.040
 so change the value of these eight 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.040
 not here first 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.970
 in the next step we have to do this 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.420
 dual lines mean negate means 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.090
 from the 1 0 becomes a one and that out 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:20.420
 one once a new one is now received 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:22.860
 the following number is rung 11.01.11 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.989
 these numbers must now only with 1 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.100
 be added and done is ours 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:31.790
 two compliments what follows three times 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.470
 the one and three times the zero 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:40.290
 Now these two will pay dual 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:42.239
 here interacts again with each other 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.540
 at the addition we catch 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:48.090
 on the far right to 1 +0 is just here 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.340
 only a 1 in the second one plus one too 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:54.030
 one exactly like the third one plus 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.280
 new equals 1 at the fourth we have 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.480
 one and one gives a 2 so 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.390
 write me a zero and one 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.100
 single transfer then the next one 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.900
 place one plus one plus one 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.330
 three so we write a 1 down and 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.840
 Again a single transfer here too 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.489
 again 11 to 13 a place a one 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.180
 in the write and a single 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:20.070
 Transfer and the last 1 we write 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:22.769
 a 1+ nothing is 1 but the last 1 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.299
 we can leave here or will 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.510
 generally omitted if you are with the 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:30.079
 two compliments added so get 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.079
 we now as a result 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:36.780
 11.01.11 if you have this dual number now in 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.700
 a decimation payment will count 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.400
 you can see that the numbers are 550 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:46.790
 what will come out of course right 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.790
 only 63 8 gives 55
