is<00:02:51.400> an<00:02:51.639> XLR<00:02:52.709> remote<00:02:53.709> connector<00:02:54.280> that<00:02:54.700> means<00:02:54.940> I

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
is an XLR remote connector that means I

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.059 
is an XLR remote connector that means I
can<00:02:55.480> extend<00:02:55.930> that<00:02:56.049> with<00:02:56.260> a<00:02:56.290> normal<00:02:56.530> microphone

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
can extend that with a normal microphone

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.560 
can extend that with a normal microphone
or<00:02:57.280> run<00:02:57.549> the<00:02:57.850> whole<00:02:58.000> thing<00:02:58.209> through<00:02:58.630> the<00:02:58.840> multi

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
or run the whole thing through the multi

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.330 
or run the whole thing through the multi
multi-color<00:03:00.570> in<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:00.750> studio<00:03:01.170> put<00:03:01.920> that<00:03:02.130> in

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
multi-color in the studio put that in

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.550 
multi-color in the studio put that in
the<00:03:02.490> recording<00:03:02.850> room<00:03:02.940> and<00:03:03.350> remote<00:03:04.350> that

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
the recording room and remote that

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.250 
the recording room and remote that
through<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:05.010> mom<00:03:05.160> multicore<00:03:05.780> in<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:06.930> control

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
through the mom multicore in the control

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.800 
through the mom multicore in the control
room<00:03:07.290> that's<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.520> idea<00:03:08.760> yet<00:03:08.940> what<00:03:09.150> about<00:03:09.600> the

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
room that's the idea yet what about the

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.450 
room that's the idea yet what about the
international<00:03:10.470> voltage<00:03:10.890> and<00:03:11.070> whatnot

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
international voltage and whatnot

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.330 
international voltage and whatnot
obviously<00:03:12.000> that's<00:03:12.180> motorized<00:03:12.750> well<00:03:13.380> the<00:03:14.220> only

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
obviously that's motorized well the only

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.030 
obviously that's motorized well the only
thing<00:03:14.460> is<00:03:14.670> you<00:03:14.700> have<00:03:14.790> to<00:03:14.970> put<00:03:15.240> in<00:03:15.530> for<00:03:16.530> double

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
thing is you have to put in for double

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.870 
thing is you have to put in for double
for<00:03:17.490> double<00:03:17.850> aa's<00:03:18.170> that's<00:03:19.170> all<00:03:19.470> no<00:03:20.190> national

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
for double aa's that's all no national

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.670 
for double aa's that's all no national
is<00:03:21.000> it<00:03:21.120> get<00:03:21.240> international<00:03:21.630> only<00:03:22.230> on<00:03:22.320> battery

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
is it get international only on battery

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.340 
is it get international only on battery
the<00:03:22.950> battery<00:03:23.070> to<00:03:23.400> release<00:03:24.270> really<00:03:25.020> long<00:03:25.200> I

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
the battery to release really long I

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:26.990 
the battery to release really long I
mean<00:03:25.470> I<00:03:25.530> have<00:03:25.680> that<00:03:25.830> in<00:03:26.010> for<00:03:26.250> five<00:03:26.490> weeks<00:03:26.730> now

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
mean I have that in for five weeks now

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.690 
mean I have that in for five weeks now
without<00:03:27.660> recharging<00:03:28.020> and<00:03:28.380> I<00:03:29.280> think

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
without recharging and I think

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.210 
without recharging and I think
everything<00:03:29.940> will<00:03:30.780> be<00:03:30.900> smooth<00:03:31.200> is<00:03:31.380> a<00:03:31.740> knack<00:03:32.070> you

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
everything will be smooth is a knack you

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.500 
everything will be smooth is a knack you
packing<00:03:32.520> that<00:03:32.670> I<00:03:32.850> mean<00:03:33.000> you<00:03:33.120> remove<00:03:33.390> the

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
packing that I mean you remove the

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.270 
packing that I mean you remove the
screws<00:03:33.810> put<00:03:34.350> another<00:03:34.590> pack<00:03:34.860> in<00:03:35.010> there<00:03:35.160> and

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
screws put another pack in there and

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.150
