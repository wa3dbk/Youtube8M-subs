00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 Hello everyone and this review will be dedicated 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.099
 such a wonderful indicator as 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.900
 Bronte small blue he is with me 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.690
 here in this bottle 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.710
 there is a loud solution in this bottle 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.260
 oh go blue 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:22.560
 this indicator he alcohol solution on 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:26.449
 95 percent alcohol has a bright orange 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.130
 such is the color and now we will 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:33.020
 determine which one is here 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.670
 test tubes we have what kind of environment 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.100
 that is, one of them is sour in the other 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.980
 neutral other in 3 alkaline 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:47.719
 so let's get down to the actual 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.719
 manipulations with a drop of each 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:55.160
 test tubes our alcohol solution thunder 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.160
 blue thymol 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:02.270
 so here 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.860
 sour environment here with us 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.420
 neutral environment why because bromine 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:13.100
 the simulator didn't go green 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.100
 and here we have an alkaline environment 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:22.049
 in this way we have established 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.880
 which environments 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:30.090
 in our test tubes let's better 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:34.430
 shake so that the color was more 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:38.090
 bright and so we got 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.090
 range of colors 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.500
 Bronte mole and blue it is in an acidic environment 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:47.409
 gives us yellow paint 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:52.270
 neutral among green and alkaline 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.750
 it gives a bright blue coloration of bromine 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.090
 canopy 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:59.700
 this is probably my favorite indicator 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:02.890
 why because he gives bright 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:07.270
 spectral picture of colors and he 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:10.989
 not sensitive enough to change from 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.590
 neutral environment in a sour left-hander night 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:16.450
 side even the slightest change gives 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:22.150
 bright enough contrast change 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:25.030
 its color is such a very light 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:29.049
 well it is used by aquarists 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:32.459
 to measure a acid-base 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:36.010
 equilibrium water in aquariums 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:38.079
 i.e. yourself long enough 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.260
 used this way to 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:43.930
 manage the water in the aquarium so that the crayfish do not 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.870
 died in thailand which flows from under 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:51.760
 our so here is such a crane 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:54.160
 LED light is very good in 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.930
 cooking dissolve it best 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.840
 at 95 percent alcohol dissolve 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.930
 it here on this here 10 milliliters 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:09.090
 bottle literally need somewhere 2 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:14.500
 I took match heads by volume 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:15.609
 powder and this dropper enough about 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:22.720
 by far 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:24.190
 how to measure ph media if you 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.870
