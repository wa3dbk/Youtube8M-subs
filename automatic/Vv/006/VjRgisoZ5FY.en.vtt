criteria you put in a ranking as such

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.709 
criteria you put in a ranking as such
isn't<00:02:37.639> really<00:02:37.849> that<00:02:37.969> important<00:02:38.480> when<00:02:38.629> you

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:38.719 
isn't really that important when you

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:40.809 
isn't really that important when you
choose<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.049> University<00:02:39.650> well<00:02:40.280> I<00:02:40.310> guess<00:02:40.609> it's

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
choose the University well I guess it's

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.580 
choose the University well I guess it's
not<00:02:40.969> that<00:02:41.030> important<00:02:41.569> because<00:02:41.689> if<00:02:42.139> it<00:02:42.409> would

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
not that important because if it would

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:43.960 
not that important because if it would
have<00:02:42.709> been<00:02:42.859> important<00:02:43.400> I<00:02:43.489> would<00:02:43.639> have<00:02:43.730> gone<00:02:43.909> to

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
have been important I would have gone to

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.640 
have been important I would have gone to
live<00:02:44.269> and<00:02:44.510> and<00:02:44.659> not<00:02:44.900> to<00:02:45.019> Brussels<00:02:45.409> because

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
live and and not to Brussels because

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.710 
live and and not to Brussels because
Levin<00:02:46.040> ranking<00:02:46.669> is<00:02:46.790> much<00:02:47.030> more<00:02:47.239> higher<00:02:47.450> than

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
Levin ranking is much more higher than

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.500 
Levin ranking is much more higher than
Brussels<00:02:48.260> I<00:02:48.650> chose<00:02:49.250> this<00:02:49.430> university<00:02:50.180> not

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
Brussels I chose this university not

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.360 
Brussels I chose this university not
because<00:02:50.780> of<00:02:50.810> ranking<00:02:51.290> but<00:02:51.470> just<00:02:51.829> because<00:02:52.040> it

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
because of ranking but just because it

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.110 
because of ranking but just because it
was<00:02:52.400> not<00:02:53.120> far<00:02:53.419> from<00:02:53.689> home<00:02:53.930> I<00:02:54.290> think<00:02:54.829> in<00:02:54.919> what

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
was not far from home I think in what

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.309 
was not far from home I think in what
it's<00:02:56.120> more<00:02:56.329> important<00:02:56.750> to<00:02:56.810> feel<00:02:57.019> good<00:02:57.169> in

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
it's more important to feel good in

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.369 
it's more important to feel good in
unity<00:02:57.709> in<00:02:58.090> university<00:02:59.090> than<00:02:59.269> to<00:02:59.480> to<00:03:00.139> go<00:03:00.319> to
