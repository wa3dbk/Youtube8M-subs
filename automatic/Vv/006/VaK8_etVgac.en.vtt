00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:19.850
 malabar this is before the city has it 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.320
 precisely its freshness I counted 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.580
 black tip so what are you waiting for 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.680
 for France because it was necessary that 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.330
 I do not conceive granny and diapers 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.289
 arrival in france I never know 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.480
 returned to africa 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.679
 precisely in my native country that makes 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.730
 so do not I have time 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.079
 today it's been so long then 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.910
 the same themunes their cells in the 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.440
 limits africa if the african this book 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:46.320
 of which I am the author is therefore time that 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.610
 the discrimination of having them and 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.579
 of a certain mentality of Africans 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.270
 which in my opinion prevents the evolution of the 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.039
 black continent 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.780
 I felt that I had ground 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.550
 story because I had in front of 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.920
 me a new world 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.149
 when we leave africa for europe 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.829
 the kobo for France 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.199
 these two completely different worlds 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.140
 these two different realities of 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.830
 different politics of cultures 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.720
 different 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.189
 I felt that I had to write no 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.619
 only my lived but also some 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.409
 things will be continent to not 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.450
 forget it when you leave in the country 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.509
 left their country that is estimated to be the 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.170
 for our country we do not know 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.860
 what awaits us 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.759
 yeah you feel you have to write 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.220
 when i arrived in france it's 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.680
 true that hot and bean with me 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.370
 this mark in me so much is it an object 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.650
 with me I was more welcomed by 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.500
 whites for banks have blacks 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.760
 camber look but it's a little bit 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.340
 good little island to the bone that there is 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.640
 Africa the nla the good I did not you 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.460

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.900
 someone who is no longer down and the 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.870
 plans by contrast came to me was 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.010
 Nice girl from Africa by us a little 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.230
 how does it go there what is that 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.120

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:03.479
 if not their camp a peeled if 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:07.350
 I called lÃ©dar that she accepts one of 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:10.260

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.800

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.300
 arpida at my jamaican comrade have 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.920
 continued on my grandmother her margin is 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.780
 party I spent a lot of my 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.709
 life there at karting is at my place 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.260
 grandma and aunt 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.330
 I had a pump the year full of friends I 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.750
 still remember 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.750
 but in May 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.340
 x30 of jean galfione gerard I myself 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.920
 remember primary schools I did 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.280
 I believe the cp2 at school ensures its 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.920
 red 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.519
 I did not attend school at your school 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.260
 notice why do I do it for me but 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.760
 who are almost no longer in the Congo if 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.950
 we did not like traveling by 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.900
 technologies travel a lot for 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.959
 universities but an African proverb 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.590
 who says that one word can all 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.900
 signified 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.849
 while a thousand words can be 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.019
 foolish and so I do not feel like it 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.459
 to create an emulsion is funny because 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.959
 in page well because I was not 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.629
 too inspired but maybe because 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:08.019
 I found that 140 pages I could say 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:09.760
 the essential the minimum that the message 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:13.840
 that I saw him pass to 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.099
 african bahia also rama yade who told me 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.870
 a lot inspired while I'm doing a 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.040
 big book for his book the tornadoes 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.739
 youth 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.909
 and I even almost terrace with 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.239
 windows the African youth 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:26.230
 it's a shame and it's signed between air 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.299
 it's something that I do other 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.260
 games so when I was in front of 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.879
 tongs and therefore to make 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.230
 books it was really I repeat it to myself 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:33.790
 to please what I really 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.269
 a lot of things that I put my 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.400
 Wall 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.200
 I have several books that I have 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.849
 not done says is in any case and the 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.349
 Muslims is selling the paddles the first 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:45.099
 to be could the moors the first that 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:46.689
 I took I postulated in several 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:49.689
 publishing houses I sent my 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:52.239
 manuscript so that I can 52 years 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:54.670
 was 10 years old though I have a lot of 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.650
 reviews until I found the 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.810
 tunnels who realized referred to as chicken 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.579
 run book so ever between the iron 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.379
 first too when I spoke agitated 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:06.150
 I'll have to for the games be 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:06.150
 depressed before the end of the year
