there<00:04:25.009> is<00:04:25.039> no<00:04:25.250> right<00:04:25.490> or<00:04:25.520> wrong<00:04:25.759> way<00:04:25.970> but<00:04:26.180> in<00:04:26.780> my

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
there is no right or wrong way but in my

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.980 
there is no right or wrong way but in my
system<00:04:27.680> this<00:04:28.220> would<00:04:28.460> be<00:04:28.729> the<00:04:28.880> non<00:04:29.150> desirable

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
system this would be the non desirable

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.100 
system this would be the non desirable
way<00:04:30.190> okay<00:04:31.190> I<00:04:31.370> want<00:04:31.789> you<00:04:31.820> to<00:04:31.910> feel<00:04:32.330> it<00:04:32.539> and<00:04:32.690> feel

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
way okay I want you to feel it and feel

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.640 
way okay I want you to feel it and feel
the<00:04:33.139> difference<00:04:33.740> so<00:04:34.520> that<00:04:34.550> if<00:04:34.970> you<00:04:35.180> ever<00:04:35.590> go<00:04:36.590> to

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
the difference so that if you ever go to

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.010 
the difference so that if you ever go to
this<00:04:37.070> tight-lip<00:04:37.820> then<00:04:38.120> you'll<00:04:38.449> be<00:04:38.750> able<00:04:38.930> to

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
this tight-lip then you'll be able to

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.939 
this tight-lip then you'll be able to
feel<00:04:39.289> the<00:04:39.530> difference<00:04:39.560> okay<00:04:41.620> this<00:04:42.620> is<00:04:42.800> what's

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:42.949 
feel the difference okay this is what's

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:45.430 
feel the difference okay this is what's
intuitive<00:04:43.639> and<00:04:43.880> this<00:04:44.090> is<00:04:44.270> my<00:04:44.479> fear<00:04:44.840> and<00:04:45.050> why

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
intuitive and this is my fear and why

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.520 
intuitive and this is my fear and why
the<00:04:45.979> harmonica<00:04:46.669> is<00:04:46.880> one<00:04:47.810> of<00:04:47.930> the<00:04:47.990> easiest

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
the harmonica is one of the easiest

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.159 
the harmonica is one of the easiest
instruments<00:04:49.280> on<00:04:49.370> the<00:04:49.699> planet<00:04:50.210> and<00:04:50.449> yet<00:04:50.930> so

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
instruments on the planet and yet so

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:53.110 
instruments on the planet and yet so
many<00:04:51.289> people<00:04:51.620> start<00:04:51.949> up<00:04:52.160> with<00:04:52.370> it<00:04:52.490> and<00:04:52.669> quit

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
many people start up with it and quit

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.640 
many people start up with it and quit
because<00:04:53.330> they<00:04:53.509> can<00:04:53.780> never<00:04:53.930> get<00:04:54.229> these<00:04:54.380> nice

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
because they can never get these nice

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.270 
because they can never get these nice
soulful<00:04:55.430> sounds<00:04:55.849> yeah

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
soulful sounds yeah

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.499 
soulful sounds yeah
because<00:04:58.280> what's<00:04:58.520> intuitive<00:04:59.330> to<00:04:59.509> do<00:04:59.750> is

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:01.509 
because what's intuitive to do is

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:04.150 
because what's intuitive to do is
actually<00:05:02.509> taking<00:05:03.080> you<00:05:03.169> down<00:05:03.380> a<00:05:03.410> direction<00:05:04.070> of

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
actually taking you down a direction of

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.629 
actually taking you down a direction of
having<00:05:04.430> a<00:05:04.520> very<00:05:04.610> stiff<00:05:05.150> tongue<00:05:06.099> okay<00:05:07.099> so<00:05:07.580> you

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:07.639 
having a very stiff tongue okay so you

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:09.279 
having a very stiff tongue okay so you
noticed<00:05:08.000> if<00:05:08.180> he<00:05:08.330> actually<00:05:08.479> did<00:05:08.720> fairly<00:05:09.080> well

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:09.289 
noticed if he actually did fairly well

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:11.230 
noticed if he actually did fairly well
she<00:05:09.710> actually<00:05:09.800> played<00:05:10.190> she<00:05:10.550> hit<00:05:10.789> most<00:05:11.000> of<00:05:11.180> the

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
she actually played she hit most of the

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.680 
she actually played she hit most of the
notes<00:05:11.710> thing<00:05:12.710> is<00:05:13.009> she<00:05:13.759> didn't<00:05:14.270> have<00:05:14.360> a<00:05:14.419> lot<00:05:14.570> of

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
notes thing is she didn't have a lot of

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.839 
notes thing is she didn't have a lot of
soul<00:05:14.990> and<00:05:15.259> feelings<00:05:15.830> that's<00:05:16.220> the<00:05:16.460> difference

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:16.849 
soul and feelings that's the difference

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:18.969 
soul and feelings that's the difference
work<00:05:17.120> that<00:05:17.330> we're<00:05:17.509> developing<00:05:17.750> a<00:05:18.169> method<00:05:18.650> that

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
work that we're developing a method that

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:20.830 
work that we're developing a method that
we<00:05:19.190> can<00:05:19.490> play<00:05:19.880> with<00:05:19.909> a<00:05:20.060> lot<00:05:20.210> of<00:05:20.240> soul<00:05:20.599> and

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
we can play with a lot of soul and

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.610 
we can play with a lot of soul and
feeling<00:05:21.580> so<00:05:22.580> that's<00:05:22.789> own<00:05:23.090> enjoy<00:05:23.479> how<00:05:23.900> not<00:05:24.380> to

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
feeling so that's own enjoy how not to

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.469 
feeling so that's own enjoy how not to
do<00:05:24.770> it<00:05:24.949> so<00:05:25.099> now<00:05:25.520> you<00:05:25.580> really<00:05:26.000> were<00:05:26.120> going<00:05:26.270> to<00:05:26.330> do

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 
do it so now you really were going to do

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:29.529 
do it so now you really were going to do
how<00:05:26.750> to<00:05:27.080> do<00:05:27.560> it<00:05:27.710> in<00:05:27.919> the<00:05:28.039> next<00:05:28.370> lesson<00:05:28.820> see<00:05:29.449> you

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:29.539 
how to do it in the next lesson see you

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:35.690 
how to do it in the next lesson see you
in<00:05:29.599> a<00:05:29.659> minute<00:05:29.860> come<00:05:30.860> back
