00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:05.790 
rank system why wouldn't you look at one

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:07.880

of the games includes black ops 2 why

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:09.530 
of the games includes black ops 2 why
would<00:07:08.070> you<00:07:08.100> only<00:07:08.370> have<00:07:08.640> league<00:07:08.880> play<00:07:09.180> in<00:07:09.420> the

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:09.540 
would you only have league play in the

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:12.560 
would you only have league play in the
rank<00:07:09.750> system<00:07:10.010> but<00:07:11.010> one<00:07:11.190> of<00:07:11.220> them<00:07:11.460> has<00:07:11.570> rolled

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:12.570 
rank system but one of them has rolled

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:15.500 
rank system but one of them has rolled
at<00:07:12.750> war<00:07:12.930> black<00:07:13.500> ops<00:07:13.710> 1<00:07:13.830> and<00:07:14.400> black<00:07:14.670> ops<00:07:14.940> 2<00:07:15.180> and

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:15.510 
at war black ops 1 and black ops 2 and

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:17.600 
at war black ops 1 and black ops 2 and
the<00:07:15.870> other<00:07:15.990> one<00:07:16.140> has<00:07:16.350> called<00:07:16.590> before<00:07:16.800> mw2<00:07:17.430> and

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:17.610 
the other one has called before mw2 and

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:20.000 
the other one has called before mw2 and
mw3<00:07:17.820> and<00:07:18.420> it<00:07:18.480> says<00:07:18.630> remastered<00:07:19.290> for<00:07:19.530> next-gen

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:20.010 
mw3 and it says remastered for next-gen

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:22.000 
mw3 and it says remastered for next-gen
