tissue mass strength and muscle growth

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.979 
tissue mass strength and muscle growth
yeah<00:00:44.940> cuz<00:00:45.180> when<00:00:45.300> you're<00:00:45.420> working<00:00:45.510> out<00:00:45.750> pretty

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
hard you know break some tissues you got

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.900 
hard you know break some tissues you got
to<00:00:49.410> repair<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:49.829> so<00:00:50.309> I'll<00:00:50.430> glue<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.670> me<00:00:50.789> house

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
to repair it so I'll glue to me house

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.250 
to repair it so I'll glue to me house
with<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.440> here<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.860> omega<00:00:53.850> 3<00:00:54.239> which<00:00:55.230> is

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
with that here is a omega 3 which is

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.119 
with that here is a omega 3 which is
essential<00:00:55.920> fatty<00:00:56.309> body<00:00:57.239> assets<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.320> uh

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
essential fatty body assets and uh

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.060 
essential fatty body assets and uh
usually<00:00:59.940> made<00:01:00.300> up<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.690> fish<00:01:01.199> oils<00:01:01.620> such<00:01:02.010> as

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
usually made up of fish oils such as

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.570 
usually made up of fish oils such as
salmon<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:03.090> sardines<00:01:03.600> those<00:01:04.199> are<00:01:04.350> just<00:01:04.580> some

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
salmon and sardines those are just some

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.700 
salmon and sardines those are just some
torrid<00:01:06.119> schule<00:01:07.909> reduces<00:01:08.909> death<00:01:09.299> we<00:01:09.900> use<00:01:10.439> this

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
torrid schule reduces death we use this

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.490 
torrid schule reduces death we use this
for<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.640> reduce<00:01:11.970> duck<00:01:12.240> yeah<00:01:12.540> low<00:01:12.990> risk<00:01:13.290> of

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
for to reduce duck yeah low risk of

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.230 
for to reduce duck yeah low risk of
heart<00:01:13.680> attacks<00:01:14.040> strokes<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.850> heart<00:01:15.000> disease

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
heart attacks strokes and heart disease

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.820 
heart attacks strokes and heart disease
annoyed<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.439> then<00:01:16.880> disorders<00:01:18.200> let's<00:01:19.200> go<00:01:19.409> put

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
annoyed and then disorders let's go put

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.880 
annoyed and then disorders let's go put
the<00:01:20.600> omega-3<00:01:21.600> fatty<00:01:21.900> acids<00:01:22.320> pretty<00:01:22.500> important

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
the omega-3 fatty acids pretty important

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.609 
the omega-3 fatty acids pretty important
because<00:01:23.009> uh<00:01:23.220> your<00:01:23.850> body<00:01:24.060> can't<00:01:24.450> produce<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:25.049> so

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
because uh your body can't produce it so

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.020 
because uh your body can't produce it so
it<00:01:25.770> needs<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.070> get<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.340> from<00:01:26.490> somewhere<00:01:26.520> and

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
it needs to get it from somewhere and

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.899 
it needs to get it from somewhere and
most<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.049> our<00:01:28.170> diets<00:01:28.500> don't<00:01:28.770> contain<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.280> up<00:01:29.400> or

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
most of our diets don't contain it up or

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.390 
most of our diets don't contain it up or
make<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.210> 3<00:01:30.360> fatty<00:01:30.630> acids<00:01:31.079> so<00:01:31.799> that's<00:01:32.220> pretty

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
make it 3 fatty acids so that's pretty

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.870 
make it 3 fatty acids so that's pretty
key<00:01:32.700> here<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:34.409> vitamin<00:01:34.950> C<00:01:35.340> which<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:37.880> used

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
key here the vitamin C which is a used

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.480 
key here the vitamin C which is a used
especially<00:01:39.750> for<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.290> immune<00:01:40.530> system<00:01:40.560> for<00:01:41.460> the

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
especially for the immune system for the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.550 
especially for the immune system for the
immune<00:01:41.909> system<00:01:42.530> helps<00:01:43.530> with<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.740> covering<00:01:44.399> of

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
immune system helps with the covering of

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.440 
immune system helps with the covering of
muscle<00:01:46.560> stress<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.579> injuries<00:01:48.210> about

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
muscle stress and injuries about

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.280 
muscle stress and injuries about
athletes<00:01:48.960> users<00:01:49.439> yeah

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
athletes users yeah

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.050 
athletes users yeah
and<00:01:52.920> another<00:01:53.250> thing<00:01:53.340> about<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.850> immune

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
and another thing about the immune

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.840 
and another thing about the immune
system<00:01:54.090> is<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.750> uh<00:01:55.640> when<00:01:56.640> you're<00:01:56.760> working

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
system is that uh when you're working

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.850 
system is that uh when you're working
out<00:01:57.150> pretty<00:01:57.390> intense<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:58.260> know<00:01:58.290> building

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
out pretty intense you know building

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.040 
out pretty intense you know building
muscle<00:01:59.160> and<00:01:59.190> all<00:01:59.340> that<00:01:59.660> not<00:02:00.660> only<00:02:00.840> is<00:02:01.020> your

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
muscle and all that not only is your

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.840 
muscle and all that not only is your
muscles<00:02:01.590> getting<00:02:01.830> you<00:02:02.010> know<00:02:02.100> damaged<00:02:02.610> and

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
muscles getting you know damaged and

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.450 
muscles getting you know damaged and
getting<00:02:03.120> torn<00:02:03.330> but<00:02:03.720> the<00:02:04.650> immune<00:02:04.950> system<00:02:04.980> is

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
getting torn but the immune system is

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.220 
getting torn but the immune system is
depleted<00:02:05.940> you<00:02:06.150> know<00:02:06.270> you're<00:02:06.480> nervous<00:02:06.660> system

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:07.230 
depleted you know you're nervous system

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.230 
depleted you know you're nervous system
in<00:02:07.530> central<00:02:07.890> nervous<00:02:08.070> system<00:02:08.490> is<00:02:08.610> also<00:02:08.790> shot

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
in central nervous system is also shot

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.770 
in central nervous system is also shot
so<00:02:09.600> you<00:02:10.470> want<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.800> you<00:02:11.460> know<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:12.390> prevent
