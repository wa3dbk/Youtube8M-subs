I think I just paused it this is

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.370 
I think I just paused it this is
obviously<00:02:55.780> a<00:02:56.080> functionality<00:02:56.560> issue<00:02:56.920> but<00:02:58.380> that

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
obviously a functionality issue but that

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.620

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.680 

I<00:03:12.290> wonder<00:03:13.069> if<00:03:13.160> I<00:03:13.250> can<00:03:13.310> change<00:03:13.819> the<00:03:14.120> settings

here<00:03:15.280> this<00:03:16.280> is<00:03:16.459> what<00:03:16.700> do<00:03:16.760> I<00:03:16.819> have<00:03:16.910> to<00:03:17.030> hold<00:03:17.239> my

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
here this is what do I have to hold my

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:25.750 
here this is what do I have to hold my
finger<00:03:17.599> down<00:03:23.319> well<00:03:24.319> I<00:03:24.590> wouldn't<00:03:25.400> say<00:03:25.520> it's

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
finger down well I wouldn't say it's

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.580 
finger down well I wouldn't say it's
flawless<00:03:26.150> but<00:03:26.630> the<00:03:26.870> fact<00:03:27.080> that<00:03:27.200> it's<00:03:27.380> working

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
flawless but the fact that it's working

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.850 
flawless but the fact that it's working
is<00:03:28.010> a<00:03:28.459> great<00:03:28.790> sign<00:03:29.030> I<00:03:29.810> watch<00:03:30.380> a<00:03:30.440> lot<00:03:30.470> of<00:03:30.620> shows

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
is a great sign I watch a lot of shows

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.820 
is a great sign I watch a lot of shows
on<00:03:31.010> hulu<00:03:31.310> and<00:03:31.870> if<00:03:32.870> I<00:03:32.959> sit<00:03:33.200> close<00:03:33.380> enough<00:03:33.620> to<00:03:33.709> my

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
on hulu and if I sit close enough to my

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.290 
on hulu and if I sit close enough to my
router<00:03:34.040> I<00:03:34.190> think<00:03:34.400> it'll<00:03:34.550> be<00:03:34.610> smooth<00:03:34.850> enough<00:03:35.060> so

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
router I think it'll be smooth enough so

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.470 
router I think it'll be smooth enough so
there<00:03:36.290> you<00:03:36.410> go
