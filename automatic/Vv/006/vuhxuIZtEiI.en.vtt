00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.410
 good people from youtube we are in last 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.600
 of jp h and this time we're going to bring a 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.220
 tutorial on how to ignore the 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.170
 position of a work in very few 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.670
 seconds what we are going to need is a 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.369
 cell phone with stopwatch that we're going to 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.669
 activate now a strip or a piece of 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.039
 fabric that has a government garment 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.710
 then a weave with a very good 

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:39.020
 tip 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.270
 it has to be yes or yes very good tip 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.399
 good to discover what you 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.829
 will now teach what we are going to see now 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:50.339
 let's prepare the cell phone 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:53.929
 let's put on chronometer 200 we're going to 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:53.929
 look for the chronometer 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.590
 we go to stopwatch so that you 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.020
 remove the doubt as to time 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.690
 may be what we are going to do is 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:09.090
 First, I'll show you what the 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.300
 of every good thing in the part of here 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.740
 above is the one of the brooch above 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.740
 true because it rises up after 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.979
 of the level of the blade or the 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.180
 sheet metal needle and here that is 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.150
 blank do not know whether distinguish again 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.160
 which is the one that is right straight that is 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.229
 that the one that you have to choose 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.050
 take out two or three stitches and then 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:35.190
 others is done only behind we have with 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:37.500
 black they see it's just but it shows 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.560
 is with black 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.760
 green here on top a green 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.590
 half phosphorescent and white on the line 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.060
 of the good needle what we are going to do 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.220
 is to ignore three points then 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.290
 we put the stopwatch now on how much 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.810
 time we can do it is a way 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.790
 very simple for and especially 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.500
 It works with the jersey and if it has 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.100
 acetate or web in polyester hotels 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.300
 fine or what they do is that you wear shirts with 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.280
 falls woman t-shirts 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.350
 all that you can sew fast because 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.910
 we know what it is to sew is not easy 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.440
 what we are going to do is this for our 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:15.870
 stopwatch to walk ready and already good 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:20.510
 started on the chronometer we 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.770
 the first two stitches 1 2 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.400
 we throw the needle down the mark 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.870
 we do it this way 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.870
 and we do like that and it's already 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:36.049
 it was automatically unknown, go there 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.709
 it is open how long we take 20 seconds 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:39.319
 it's more 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.730
 remember that after scourging you 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.980
 we show the earth and we just squeeze 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.420
 the stop so you watching the video you 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.879
 you will have noticed in what time I finished 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.379
 scotch totally but good in the 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:50.780
 description of the video we are going to put you 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:52.190
 calculating in 20 or 18 seconds 20 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.290
 seconds to be more accurate than what 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.970
 we saw so good I hope you 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.829
 I liked it is a short video but 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.260
 with a little trick to be much more 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:02.180
 quick and useful for you what 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.099
 clothing things that fine fabrics 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.920

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:08.810
