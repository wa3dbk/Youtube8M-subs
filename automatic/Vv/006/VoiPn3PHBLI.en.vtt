hi friends this is mama chuckle here and
in<00:00:02.730> this<00:00:02.820> tutorial<00:00:02.970> I'm<00:00:03.360> going<00:00:03.510> to<00:00:03.570> show<00:00:03.629> you

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
in this tutorial I'm going to show you

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.889 
in this tutorial I'm going to show you
how<00:00:04.500> you<00:00:04.560> can<00:00:04.799> design<00:00:04.980> a<00:00:05.279> tire<00:00:05.549> in<00:00:06.330> CATIA<00:00:06.839> v5

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
how you can design a tire in CATIA v5

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.110 
how you can design a tire in CATIA v5
using<00:00:07.649> the<00:00:07.770> part<00:00:07.980> design<00:00:08.309> and<00:00:08.519> wireframe<00:00:09.000> and

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
using the part design and wireframe and

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.810 
using the part design and wireframe and
surface<00:00:09.510> design<00:00:09.809> workbench<00:00:10.400> so<00:00:11.400> this<00:00:11.670> is<00:00:11.790> a

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
surface design workbench so this is a

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.549 
surface design workbench so this is a
completed<00:00:12.269> design<00:00:12.480> where<00:00:12.840> you<00:00:12.870> can<00:00:13.080> see<00:00:13.259> here

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
completed design where you can see here

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.760 
completed design where you can see here
and<00:00:13.769> I'm<00:00:14.639> going<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:14.880> show<00:00:15.089> you<00:00:15.500> how<00:00:16.500> you<00:00:16.560> can

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
and I'm going to show you how you can

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.980 
and I'm going to show you how you can
design<00:00:17.070> it<00:00:17.220> from<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.699> scratch<00:00:17.940> so<00:00:18.600> this<00:00:18.840> is<00:00:18.960> a

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
design it from the scratch so this is a

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.529 
design it from the scratch so this is a
fourth<00:00:19.289> part<00:00:19.529> of<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.710> tutorial<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.369> here<00:00:21.330> I'm

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
fourth part of the tutorial and here I'm

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.240 
fourth part of the tutorial and here I'm
going<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.810> show<00:00:21.869> you<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.380> next<00:00:22.590> step<00:00:22.740> which<00:00:23.220> is

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
going to show you the next step which is

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.060 
going to show you the next step which is
to<00:00:23.519> be<00:00:23.640> done<00:00:23.960> so<00:00:24.960> we<00:00:25.350> are<00:00:25.650> going<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.830> select

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
to be done so we are going to select

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.980 
to be done so we are going to select
this<00:00:26.340> closed<00:00:26.640> surface<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.539> we<00:00:27.660> created

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
this closed surface that we created

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.939 
this closed surface that we created
first<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.820> circular<00:00:30.179> pattern<00:00:30.570> together

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:30.949 
first and the circular pattern together

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:33.590 
first and the circular pattern together
press<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.070> control<00:00:32.430> key<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.910> prints<00:00:33.270> both<00:00:33.450> of

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
press the control key and prints both of

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.930 
press the control key and prints both of
them<00:00:33.780> an<00:00:34.079> insert<00:00:34.860> transformation<00:00:35.700> feature

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
them an insert transformation feature

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.040 
them an insert transformation feature
use<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.899> mirror<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.610> then<00:00:38.610> we<00:00:39.270> need<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.719> select

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
use a mirror and then we need to select

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.930 
use a mirror and then we need to select
this<00:00:40.350> plane<00:00:40.620> here<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.070> click<00:00:41.879> on<00:00:42.030> OK

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
this plane here and click on OK

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.050 
this plane here and click on OK
so<00:00:44.600> we<00:00:44.720> got<00:00:44.960> another<00:00:45.739> pattern<00:00:46.670> on<00:00:46.760> the<00:00:46.880> right

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:47.060 
so we got another pattern on the right

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.050 
so we got another pattern on the right
side<00:00:47.420> so<00:00:48.290> we're<00:00:48.380> gonna<00:00:48.500> create<00:00:48.710> some<00:00:49.190> you<00:00:49.940> know

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:50.060 
side so we're gonna create some you know

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.910 
side so we're gonna create some you know
fancy<00:00:50.360> pattern<00:00:50.900> on<00:00:50.960> the<00:00:51.020> middle<00:00:51.320> and<00:00:51.559> that's

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
fancy pattern on the middle and that's

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.280 
fancy pattern on the middle and that's
it<00:00:52.220> so<00:00:55.180> I'm<00:00:56.180> gonna<00:00:56.390> select<00:00:56.629> this<00:00:56.989> particular

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
it so I'm gonna select this particular

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.030 
it so I'm gonna select this particular
plane<00:00:57.739> here<00:00:58.129> click<00:00:58.910> on<00:00:59.030> sketch<00:00:59.360> and<00:00:59.890> here<00:01:00.890> I'm

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
plane here click on sketch and here I'm

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.140 
plane here click on sketch and here I'm
going<00:01:01.190> to<00:01:01.280> create<00:01:01.460> the<00:01:01.850> next<00:01:02.269> pattern<00:01:03.550> so<00:01:04.550> we

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
going to create the next pattern so we

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.740 
going to create the next pattern so we
got

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.270 

what<00:01:11.320> we're<00:01:11.440> gonna<00:01:11.530> do<00:01:11.800> is<00:01:12.010> we're<00:01:12.220> gonna

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
what we're gonna do is we're gonna

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.029 
what we're gonna do is we're gonna
create

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:14.039 
create

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:29.570 
create
maybe<00:01:14.549> something<00:01:15.060> like<00:01:15.240> this

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.840 

all<00:01:29.940> right

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
all right

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.590 
all right
I'll<00:01:31.909> make<00:01:32.720> these<00:01:33.080> two<00:01:33.380> lines

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
I'll make these two lines

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.450 
I'll make these two lines
parallel<00:01:36.409> to<00:01:36.439> each<00:01:36.710> other

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.550 

and<00:01:40.550> then<00:01:41.120> and<00:01:41.750> I'll<00:01:41.930> use

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
and then and I'll use

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.039 
and then and I'll use
all<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.490> designs<00:01:44.820> use<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.869> mirror

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
all of the designs use the mirror

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.510 
all of the designs use the mirror
command<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:47.189> measure<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.509> then

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
command and measure it and then

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.510 
command and measure it and then
closed<00:01:51.180> us

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.460 

all<00:01:53.970> right<00:01:54.119> that's<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.750> let's<00:01:55.110> come<00:01:55.259> out<00:01:55.380> of

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
all right that's it let's come out of

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.240 
all right that's it let's come out of
the<00:01:55.530> skates<00:01:55.820> and<00:01:56.820> now<00:01:57.649> as<00:01:58.649> I've<00:01:58.890> done<00:01:59.100> before
