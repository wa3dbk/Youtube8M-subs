00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.890
 cell phone 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.540

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.660
 you click the link it will be on 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.879
 description of the video you click on the link 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.559
 you were here you're going to be 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.670
 redirected to this page here 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.789
 flickr 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.410
 so you'll wait five seconds 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:58.530
 wait five seconds on this page 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.899
 so you click on close advertisement 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.789
 clicking here you will be redirected 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.339
 for your android kim page 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.909
 useful where you will click this button 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.689
 envy of the defron ftp omc or any 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.760
 thing like that 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.340
 so you click here the download goes 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.920
 start automatically then you download 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.840
 this program here that installs 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.150
 He will not find it to install because 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.720
 I already have it here on my computer then 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.830
 The next step is to connect your 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.070
 cell phone 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.970
 in good personal pc but for this you 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.800
 must have been activated sbt decoration 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.580
 Your cell phone will not do anything at all. 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.620
 then you also need to have the drivers 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.170
 of your android installed 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.480
 if you do not know if you have 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.880
 groups of drivers of your state 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.130
 or you do not know how to download these drivers 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.680
 There's going to be a video that I 'm going to 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.960
 link in the video description you will see 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.330
 the video then you will learn how to only 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.760
 the drives of your android do not bet 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:03.390
 these drivers installed by your Jorge 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:06.090
 you can continue here sectorial 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.990
 So next step you connect your 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.899
 cell phone 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.370
 is by USB cable or your computer turns on 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.200
 sbt debugging 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.870
 in the video is also teaching as place 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.820
 of prayer fb if someone is not is so 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.380
 ready to connect the cell here then 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.760
 you will open the program is that the 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.190
 android google 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.870
 if you ask for cyclical permission and yes then 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.120
 you expect is going problem 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.040
 I opened this page this year 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.410
 so you have to wait a little bit here 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.850
 is looking at you is CONEC 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.390
 expecting a little look at that now it's 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:38.010
 seems to connect then just look at the 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.709
 time will offer this page that is 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.720
 where you will have a ruth button then 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.970
 will make you click this button here 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.070
 cut will start the process to 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.320
 Do you cut it on your cell phone? 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.760
 so some things showed up here 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.620
 writings and things 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.890
 this process will take around 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.450
 five minutes 10 of the team it depends 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:02.150
 much of your device 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.150
 so I 'll call if you'll read the video 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:22.010
 It 's just personal, you guys could see. 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:24.140
 who finished the roots process and already 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.620
 the phrase appears here and see 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.900
 ruth happens then ready 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.819
 Your cell phone is already with guti 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.640
 time your cell phone will start rebooting 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.379
 so you wait for your cell phone to reboot 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.629
 wait to call 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:41.299
 so you'll have to use the video that up 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:43.489
 that my cell phone and then after oscillating 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:45.980
 restart you expect to restart it 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:48.530
 connected end you see you can start 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.349
 click on pretend it will not appear here from 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.750
 new connect is not necessary you 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:55.849
 do what I'm going to show now but I 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.480
 recommend you leave your cell 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:03.920
 connected and the computer I wait a little 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:06.980
 this wait will appear a warning from your 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:11.180
 telling you if you should allow 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:14.150
 to the super user changes would be 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.100
 grant design permissions for 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.880
 this problem will appear on the screen 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.789
 of the cell phone 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.039
 I then recommend and click on enable 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:24.830
 then done that you can close this 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:27.530
 O window here and roth are done with the 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:30.169
 success on your mobile 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.419
 but I did not get it like that 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:35.360
 Good guys, I'll remember some things. 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:37.940
 it is essential to install drivers 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.440
 to make this roth process if 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.660
 You do not have 10 of your android 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.910
 insights does not matter or try because 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:47.150
 you will not be able to boot 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:50.479
 Also you should leave your phone in 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.870
 decorative usb powered on and connected to your 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:55.510
 when the process was started 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.610
 so if you could not forget the 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.890
 favorite video in the 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.990
 and I'm 100 in my 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:04.480
 channel to stay inside all the 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.510
 all-purpose news and updates 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:10.930
 to talk to those who did not follow I ask that 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.640
 not left negative in the video because the 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.280
 I'll be liking more methods 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.960
 that how to boot into your android goes 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.210
 this method did not work I'll be 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.550
 betting another method so that you 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.220
 I'm going to post several methods 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.650
 several ways until you can 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.600
 root on your android and also get 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.970
 you look here in the description of the video already 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.130
 will have some other methods if you will have 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.380
 a link there you will be directed to 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.400
 video when you click then that's it 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.180
