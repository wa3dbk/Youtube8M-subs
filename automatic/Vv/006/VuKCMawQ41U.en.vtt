00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 dear colleagues we are preparing today 1 of 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.030
 the most delicious 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:11.480
 and the simplest cakes waffle cake for 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.780
 we will need this 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:18.779
 oils 200 grams a pack but you can buy and 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:23.369
 100 immediately butter 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:28.050
 waffle cake sealed here 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:31.529
 ribbed some screaming 65 grams of pot 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:37.520
 condensed milk in already boiled it is the simplest 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:40.649
 Means boiled already condensed milk 300 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.260
 370 530 grams depending on how much 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:48.120
 you put the oil so we believe 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:52.710
 open quietly open here 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:55.039
 opened take now we open oil 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.149
 and so soft 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:00.289
 should not be hard only with 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.149
 refrigerator and do not flow here is straight right 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:08.880
 I want him on bread spread pretty 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:12.479
 Spoon as I take now you see 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:16.439
 how beautiful and in the jar the most 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:19.950
 the easiest way is about 100 grams 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:23.040
 since I have condensed milk 530 grams I get on 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.970
 Dita 100 grams of oil can be a little bit 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:30.180
 we need to mix more 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.000
 formed a homogeneous mass to 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.750
 mix evenly and butter and condensed milk 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.840
 you rewind so well here because 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.290
 stara stays in a pack of me down I 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.009
 bad mixed from kuschenko if that I 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.790
 add a little more oil open 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:54.780
 waffles with scissors 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:57.659
 scissors needed that were clean kitchen 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.540
 here as not at me such but I them 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:05.130
 washed well not neat here 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:07.829
 cut neatly here without spoiling 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.300
 waffle cake mound smooth 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:13.410
 the shortbreads were even now open 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.990
 we are cleaning the paper 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.090
 take a plate and one cake from 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:22.260
 we put on the bottom 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:25.830
 the bottom of the cake is now condensed milk with 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:30.360
 buttered spoon 2 3 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:33.540
 who likes both but not so much 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:38.370
 not too little evenly 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:43.550
 smear here if you are missing 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:47.780
 masses of condensed milk with butter still slightly take 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.780
 neatly smeared 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.430
 draw a little rides on a plate at night 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.460
 terrible, you can take a little easier 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:03.300
 I like this plate I like it 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:07.340
 2 press the same cake here and put it again 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:11.820
 condensed milk and oil grease 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:14.120
 You can also quickly what I have here 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:20.690
 even faster 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:24.870
 we press now one more cats we put 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:27.270
 we press the husks a lot do not lie too 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.190
 on because then there will be years of cakes 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:33.270
 they are then soaked up by blot 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:36.690
 it turns out so we put a little bit and that pi 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:39.480
 quite a few amount of condensed milk 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.840
 There is, in principle, such a bank of condensed milk 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.290
 and 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:48.290
 100 grams of oil is enough to coat 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:51.959
 one waffle cake 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:54.290
 under the packaging of their pieces eight to ten in 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:57.420
 depending on the packaging from 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:00.270
 manufacturers how much thickness there 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.660
 waffles are also different but in principle 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:08.840
 that's how my video is basically such 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:14.150
 here are waffles sell smear smear 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:16.139
 again put Korzhik again presses 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:20.849
 again we can 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:26.029
 and so here until our end 

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:29.310
 condensed milk and our waffles still Rostov 

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:31.729
 You can sprinkle with nuts, but since we 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.289
 the easiest cake 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:37.349
 just condensed milk if you are not at home 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:40.680
 condensed milk can open any jam 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:42.020
 which does not flow in which there is no syrup 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.840
 so thick 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.330
 apricot jam and eat at home 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.009
 some cook 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:52.889
 apple oil can also be added or 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:55.379
 just waffles so smudge here 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.479
 see we are already finished finished 

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:59.969
 to coat lived such a cake 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:02.039
 let's cut it now 

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:04.469
 better take the nail files from me here not 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:06.930
 can be seen on the video but if you look closely 

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:09.389
 on this knife small small small 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:13.589
 there are such teeth with it 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:15.680
 good cut waffles such here I am 

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:19.050
 hit him cut pretty 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:24.379
 almost exactly now still in half you 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:28.669
 and 4 slices here we cut cut to the end 

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:32.009
 so that later it was convenient to take 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:34.949
 try to the end to the gentle bottom 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:37.680
 the cake was cut through too 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:40.110
 take 1 out of 4 or again cut in half 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:43.080
 can be another three parts depending kick 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:47.330
 you love pieces and now I tell you 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.330
