00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:10.260
 hello everyone 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.750
 did mean behind 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.949
 additionally highlighting here lower 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.199
 katafots here and in the trunk lid 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.470
 there were ordinary headlights 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.439
 here is not holy water too new now 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.170
 standing there along far beyond 20,000 even 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.320
 30,000 sets of everything to change that to me 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:35.040
 It seems that this refinement will allow 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.230
 here below i will send vodka vocals 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.829
 anyone interested read here by 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.040
 cost per trunk lid there 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.379
 In general, what turns out 200 300 rubles here 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.829
 in the lower reflectors there arise 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:53.370
 more here but again somewhere in the budget 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:01:02.489
 500 rubles you can meet now we 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:07.740
 turn on pray that is like this 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:09.860
 our business shines as far as there 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.170
 clearly visible 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:17.210
 the car just stands close on the day 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:24.890
 I just wanted to wait for the evening but the people wrote 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:24.890
 I post pictures show this here 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.000
 reflectors 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.409
 that is, this whole thing 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.750
 looks 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.490
 agree more sympathetic than when 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.340
 the lid of some kind of stump meaning a role 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.770
 the headlight is there to light up 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:44.579
 the luminescence of the luminescence of farted straight 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.460
 In general, one-to-one practically and this 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.610
 the site itself and you can see that you see 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.220
 can they be at this angle only 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:58.549
 view the crack that is, it lies 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.549
 bottom and the whole reflector is shining
