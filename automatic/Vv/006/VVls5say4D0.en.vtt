King I can't make any promises how much
of<00:03:45.750> it<00:03:45.870> I'm<00:03:46.019> going<00:03:46.200> to<00:03:46.320> like<00:03:47.280> but<00:03:47.730> I<00:03:47.910> like<00:03:48.239> this

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
of it I'm going to like but I like this

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.090 
of it I'm going to like but I like this
one<00:03:48.660> and<00:03:48.810> it<00:03:48.900> seems<00:03:49.109> as<00:03:49.290> good<00:03:49.380> an<00:03:49.620> introduction

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
one and it seems as good an introduction

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.560 
one and it seems as good an introduction
as<00:03:50.190> ending<00:03:50.459> into<00:03:50.579> the<00:03:50.700> world<00:03:50.940> of<00:03:51.060> Stephen<00:03:51.359> King

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
as ending into the world of Stephen King

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.140 
as ending into the world of Stephen King
so<00:03:51.930> who<00:03:52.920> knows<00:03:53.100> and<00:03:53.489> that's<00:03:53.700> it<00:03:53.850> for<00:03:53.970> today

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
so who knows and that's it for today

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.610 
so who knows and that's it for today
until<00:03:54.390> next<00:03:54.540> time<00:03:54.780> this<00:03:54.870> is<00:03:54.930> Matt<00:03:55.200> guy<00:03:55.410> and

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
until next time this is Matt guy and

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.130 
until next time this is Matt guy and
hoping<00:03:55.890> that<00:03:55.950> none<00:03:56.760> of<00:03:56.850> my<00:03:57.000> fans<00:03:57.299> are<00:03:57.570> Annie

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
hoping that none of my fans are Annie

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.709 
hoping that none of my fans are Annie
