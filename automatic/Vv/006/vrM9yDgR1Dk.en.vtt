00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:09.129
 hello all how about how you need 

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:11.440
 we are here the thirteenth stage for 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:13.209
 make the challenge of rubén plaza another 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.010
 transition stage quiet stage of 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:16.470
 recovery if you have to recover there 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:20.080
 that recovers energies to be able to later 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.720
 we have 'rough' the time trial that 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.960
 is and the alps are trying to be 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.280
 there competitive and good there are people who 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.199
 has asked that when I'm going to move to 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.570
 nairo quintana the safest thing is that what 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.309
 move I do not know if in mount tops or in the 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.079
 stage of the I saw another that is the gap in 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.650
 the other venture 'I'm going to let it go 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.050
 at your will 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.160
 it seems to me that if vegapps and I think 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.320
 I'm going to escape, I think it's the day 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.020
 what I have there to move it 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.630
 and rubén plaza I guess you will lose the 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.130
 leadership in mont ventoux good guess 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.920
 sure will lose the libreto mont 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.840
 ventoux yes and after the time trial 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.610
 I will move the assets of the Alps 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.250
 promote in the alps here I am now 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.410
 with nairo quintana there is already a habit found 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.670
 everyone out there I see rubén plaza or 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.200
 I do not worry about it whenever I go 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.840
 go ahead to dave and it seems good 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.090
 and here we have igor antón igor antón 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.380
 euskatel where will end where where 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.540
 you think it will end igor antón 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.790
 I think 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.620
 that will be going to a team where I go 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.060
 as a protected dani-type runner 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.090
 navarro but obviously with more quality 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.210
 of course better a cofidis or even 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.480
 I do not know or sojasun maybe I'd like 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:34.740
 catch a cyclist as well as the leader 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:36.750
 for hard endings and mountain because I 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.450
 I say it more like that to igor antón obviously 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.000
 with a good contract more than more than 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.040
 as a gregarious as a gregarious 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.570
 luxury I think it's called spending it 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.040
 because it has a lot of power 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.470
 It has a lot of acceleration 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.080
 here there has been a break seems that in the 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.610
 final there has been a break and it has a lot 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.370
 force does not have much force igor antón 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.080
 like to spend it as gregarious 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.120
 so I think it has to be a 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.550
 team in which is a runner if not 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.530
 leader a protected runner and you go to 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.830
 its air that may be sought the 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.869
 life there in hard endings and that 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.430
 that is a pure guy saving the 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.650
 distances but it's a purito type by the 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.170
 the endings you have 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.870
 and if Igor Anton is well 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.760
 galdácano and with confidence and good antón 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.269
 It has a lot of quality 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.340
 I love you, you know, it's a 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.500
 sorry every time you hear the orange of 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.629
 euskatel with all the years that it takes me 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.000
 it seems that it is the team that is the team 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:37.180
 oldest there is right now in the 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.250
 platoon 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.689
 I think for sure that is the dean of 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.750
 squad right now because it 's the team 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:44.920
 oldest is that there are none in the 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.329
 catheters older equipment there 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.150
 right now and it's going to disappear is a 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:52.290
 pity and good in the end has won that 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.760
 ethics will be won luis loyal Murcia and 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.069
 thinking of the cattle luís of the removed 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.109
 and the sandy road team 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.510
 to marry and good has been in quintana is 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:03.790
 here put a 40 but good for sure 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.530
 arrived in the squad as rubén 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.260
 plaza that was watching it there from 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.879
 behind and we have already finished another stage of 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.200
 transition that nothing is left I think it's 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:18.319
 the age I think the other stage and where 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:21.769
 if there is another and mont ventoux 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.840
 it seems to me and the good is coming 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:26.150
 the good because then already then everything 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.150
 eta passes and all cucumber top cucumber 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.819
 cover until the last and good here the 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.079
 general is kept let's say the stage 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.129

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:38.900
