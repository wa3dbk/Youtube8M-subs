 rose let's use this pink glaze 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:45.629
 baby on tone 6 18 to eliminate the 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.420
 excess product I will use this 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.399
 fan that is already quite old and not what 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.800

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.190

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.320

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.229
 I leave all the information related to 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.270
 prices and others here below in the box 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.190
 of information and nothing I hope you 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.090
 like this manicure and see you soon 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.090
 see you later 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.650
 ok let's start making up 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:41.800
 our nails with the tone noir plan 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.990
 In this case, I'm going to make up this 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.000
 this one and this one is going to go in another 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:50.410
 color and good because I already have it in 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.560
 only a light layer and untouched 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:56.050
 the edges of the nail is not even the 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.630
 edge of the nail neither the skin nor the 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.500
 cuticle since if we apply here 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:05.760
 enamel what we are going to do is that the 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:08.550
 velvet powder is going to 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.860
 accumulate in those parts and then it 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.040
 we will get a little out of the nail with what 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.230
 which the effect is going to be very very ugly 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.810
 let's dry 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.580
 Once the nail is dry we will go a 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.700
 for one and what we're going to do is go back 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.670
 to give it a second layer and this time not 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.280
 we will wait for it to dry but 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.819
 that we are going to take the 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:38.060
 little boat of the color that we are going to put and 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:38.060
 we put it inside so pressing 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:46.290
 let's say for one side and for another for 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:48.690
 that impregnates well as you see here is 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.640
 all the accumulated product and for that 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.250
 I'm going to use a brush of these that does not 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.570
 I will no longer use and what will 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.920
 to do is that very little I'm going 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.650
 Cleaning 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.010
 to the surface to remove all that 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.010
 cumulus 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:20.230
 at the same time once you have removed 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.770
 all the remaining product because I press 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.069
 a little bit so that it's finished sticking 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.069
 much better 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:32.010
 and this is the result in this nail what 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.620
 let's go doing all the nails 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.220
 the same way I will repeat the process 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.680
 for you to see 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.110
 we give a second layer of enamel 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.670
 chosen one 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.340
 and in the chosen nail 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.400
 remember not to touch the edges or the 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:52.540
 cuticles 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:55.230
 we take the product of the desired color and 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:04:02.340
 what we are going to do is insert the nail 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:02.340
 in this way and we press both sides 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.800
 if you see that it has not been caught in a little way 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:11.870
 then do not press again 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.060
 As you can see, there is all the product and 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.160
 what we are going to do is that with the help of 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.930
 a brochita then let's go very 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.930
 gently without pressing 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:27.419
 well cleaning the area a little 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.419
 dragging the product a little 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:34.530
 it's very easy very simple and also 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.950
 is so fashionable and is in the trend 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.950
 which is that the truth is that they are 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.950
 fantastic 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:46.850
 here you have it 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.850
 Well, the same thing we're going to do with this one 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.770
 with her 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.330
 and voilÃ  we have color nails 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.380
 eggplants made and now we're going to 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.810
 do 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:10.290
 the color or its first layer of enamel 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:13.130
 Rose without touching the cuticles or the skin 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.130
 from around 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:18.940
 let it dry 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:22.570
 we give a second very thin layer of 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:28.990
 pink enamel without touching the edges or the 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:32.110
 subtitles and we take the product in this 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:35.130
 case the pink segment e 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.130
 we introduce the union 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.229
 and we turn a little bit from left to 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:41.620
 right so that it is implemented well by 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:41.620
 the sides 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:50.410
 Once it's done, let's clean it 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:56.380
 i 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:56.380
 a little one with the life of an old woman 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:05.630
 I particularly like the color 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.360
 eggplant of the white as it happens more 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:11.270
 unnoticed and the effect I think it's 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:23.180
 much more beautiful in dark tones than in 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:26.480
 clear tones and we already have the effect 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:30.200
 velvet or velvet on the fingernail 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:32.210
 cancel recommendations for this kind of 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.220
 manicure well for this kind of 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.020
 manipulate so delicate is very important 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:38.360
 that if you are going to do any kind of 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:40.760
 cleaning use some suitable gloves 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:44.150
 so as not to damage the enamel 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:48.080
 On the other hand trying to touch it 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:51.650
 ketones or strong chemicals or 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:53.890
 even the makeup remover cotton 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:56.540
 I notice the cleansing cotton 

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:59.030
 contains some cellulose that stays 

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:03.380
 hooked to the surface of the hair of 

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:08.380
 manicure and afe a witt of the 

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:08.380
 cottons if you are going to wear the nails
