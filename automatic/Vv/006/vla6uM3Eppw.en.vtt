00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
ask for now the animation on this fight

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.310 
ask for now the animation on this fight
was<00:05:30.070> a<00:05:30.130> little<00:05:30.520> different<00:05:30.760> than<00:05:31.330> weird<00:05:31.600> and<00:05:31.930> a

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 
was a little different than weird and a

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
was a little different than weird and a
lot<00:05:32.590> of<00:05:32.650> people<00:05:33.040> didn't<00:05:33.730> like<00:05:33.760> that<00:05:34.030> but<00:05:34.930> I

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
lot of people didn't like that but I

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.480 
lot of people didn't like that but I
think<00:05:36.340> that<00:05:36.750> there<00:05:37.750> was<00:05:37.870> something<00:05:38.260> there<00:05:38.490> it

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
think that there was something there it

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.409 
think that there was something there it
draws<00:05:40.090> out<00:05:40.419> the<00:05:40.450> epicness<00:05:40.990> of<00:05:41.410> this<00:05:42.010> fight<00:05:42.419> and

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
draws out the epicness of this fight and

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:45.450 
draws out the epicness of this fight and
I<00:05:44.110> think<00:05:44.410> they<00:05:44.530> had<00:05:44.770> to<00:05:44.919> change<00:05:45.130> the<00:05:45.280> animation

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
I think they had to change the animation

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:54.420 
I think they had to change the animation
to<00:05:46.180> do<00:05:46.840> this<00:05:47.020> white<00:05:47.260> dust<00:05:52.410> alright<00:05:53.410> so<00:05:54.220> we<00:05:54.400> are

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
to do this white dust alright so we are

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.659 
to do this white dust alright so we are
we're<00:05:54.850> coming<00:05:55.240> up<00:05:55.390> at<00:05:55.630> number<00:05:56.260> one<00:05:56.500> what<00:05:57.370> fight

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:57.669 
we're coming up at number one what fight

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:00.659 
we're coming up at number one what fight
is<00:05:57.820> going<00:05:57.970> to<00:05:58.090> take<00:05:58.270> it<00:05:58.479> we're<00:05:58.780> moving<00:05:59.669> now

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:00.669 
is going to take it we're moving now

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:02.840 
is going to take it we're moving now
before<00:06:01.000> I<00:06:01.060> start<00:06:01.360> this<00:06:01.540> I<00:06:01.780> just<00:06:02.320> want<00:06:02.530> to<00:06:02.560> say

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:02.850 
before I start this I just want to say

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:07.080 
before I start this I just want to say
that<00:06:03.850> we<00:06:04.120> did<00:06:04.360> not<00:06:04.389> take<00:06:04.840> a<00:06:04.870> number<00:06:05.110> one<00:06:06.090> simple

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 
that we did not take a number one simple

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.990 
that we did not take a number one simple
reason<00:06:07.240> is<00:06:07.630> because<00:06:08.010> still<00:06:09.010> so<00:06:09.430> much<00:06:09.700> to<00:06:09.760> be

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 
reason is because still so much to be

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.010 
reason is because still so much to be
animated<00:06:10.810> from<00:06:11.800> the<00:06:11.919> manga<00:06:12.130> that<00:06:12.780> we<00:06:13.780> feel

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.020 
animated from the manga that we feel

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.680 
animated from the manga that we feel
that<00:06:14.050> it's<00:06:14.320> not<00:06:14.500> right<00:06:14.800> to<00:06:15.270> put<00:06:16.270> out<00:06:16.390> a<00:06:16.419> number

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:16.690 
that it's not right to put out a number

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.920 
that it's not right to put out a number
one<00:06:16.990> fight<00:06:17.229> yeah

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:18.930 
one fight yeah
