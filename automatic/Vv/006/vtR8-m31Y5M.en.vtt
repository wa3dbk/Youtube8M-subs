00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.340
 hello it's 110 for my show 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.420
 bollywood kitchen today we get 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.970
 found again for a recipe 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.470
 Indian an ultra simple recipe we have 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.030
 more the habit of seeing her with the 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.670
 meat but today I decided to 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.200
 you make tandoor eggplants for 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.120
 by this recipe we need 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.039
 Eggplant so in general the 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.470
 Eggplant we choose not too pink 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.500
 rather smooth and very bright 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.440
 we will need lime juice 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.880
 fresh ginger from ouch 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:40.980
 so the mix of tracks that we call 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.530
 tandoori yoghurt and we will add 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.610
 a little trickle of oil just now 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.930
 so we will realize some kind of 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:51.870
 marinade made from yoghurt 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:53.960
 we also put nature spices 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.960
 tandoori 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.250
 we will also add lemon juice 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:17.890
 then we're going to come and actually rap 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:20.030
 fresh ginger so in our marinade 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.100
 so if you have at home you 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.149
 can also study dough die of 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.700
 the ginger paw 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:28.840
 it works very well we do the same 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.840
 with garlic 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.679
 then we will add a small trickle 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.969
 oil 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:39.350
 so all the genotypes we use from 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:41.959
 the neutral oil the seed oil of 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:47.799
 raisin sunflower oil what you 

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:47.799
 have to mix all that 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.599
 now we will prepare our eggplants 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:02:02.020
 so we will just realized 

00:01:56.599 --> 00:02:02.020
 slices about 1 cm thick 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.590
 m 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:20.140
 we'll just dip them in 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:22.030
 our little marina da yogurt base and 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.530
 we would come to deposit on our plate 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.530
 which will then come to the oven 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.690
 so now here are our eggplants have 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.970
 rested for one to two hours so 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.170
 it is ideal for the marinade to be 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.720
 well imbued in the flesh of 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.880
 eggplant we will put our eggplant to 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.360
 cook for about 30 minutes 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:56.210
 we will return to half cooking so we have 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:03:00.710
 200 degrees and flat grid position 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.710
 so that's half an hour 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:10.740
 results so aubergines tons of 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:13.260

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:16.050
