00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:21.400 
really private I think it's a little bit

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.800 
really private I think it's a little bit
more<00:00:21.670> of<00:00:21.730> an<00:00:21.790> old<00:00:21.970> hair<00:00:22.180> short<00:00:22.450> but<00:00:22.660> I<00:00:22.689> was

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810 
more of an old hair short but I was

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:23.880 
more of an old hair short but I was
looking<00:00:23.080> through<00:00:23.110> the<00:00:23.349> pictures<00:00:23.560> and<00:00:23.860> I

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
looking through the pictures and I

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.740 
looking through the pictures and I
really<00:00:24.099> liked<00:00:24.310> it<00:00:24.460> she<00:00:24.790> had<00:00:24.910> a<00:00:24.939> very<00:00:25.240> cute<00:00:25.540> lace

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:25.750 
really liked it she had a very cute lace

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.960 
really liked it she had a very cute lace
braid<00:00:26.050> tucked<00:00:26.800> underneath<00:00:27.189> her<00:00:27.460> hair<00:00:27.759> and

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:27.970 
braid tucked underneath her hair and

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.359 
braid tucked underneath her hair and
then<00:00:28.150> nice<00:00:28.450> loose<00:00:28.750> curls<00:00:29.079> like<00:00:29.290> so<00:00:29.559> so<00:00:30.130> this<00:00:30.279> is

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
then nice loose curls like so so this is

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:32.159 
then nice loose curls like so so this is
very<00:00:30.550> simple<00:00:30.880> and<00:00:31.059> easy<00:00:31.300> to<00:00:31.630> recreate<00:00:31.899> at

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
very simple and easy to recreate at

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:33.450 
very simple and easy to recreate at
least<00:00:32.349> once<00:00:32.649> you<00:00:32.770> get<00:00:32.920> down<00:00:33.070> the<00:00:33.250> grade

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
least once you get down the grade

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.650 
least once you get down the grade
because<00:00:33.640> that's<00:00:33.880> a<00:00:33.970> little<00:00:34.149> bit<00:00:34.239> hard<00:00:34.450> to<00:00:34.480> do

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660
