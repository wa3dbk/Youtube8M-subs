00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.729
 as published by us and instinctively in our network 

00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:15.129
 by the way to go for it we need the utility of law for the bet 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:19.829
 find in the folder create applications utilities codia also 

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:21.640
 squeeze not eat 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.060
 and will do it from now 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.599
 those arrests for the x with kent ross which is a truism t 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.679
 the national police already had open for for good tutoring to open the 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.860
 configuration window obiang give you that manual postulation ophÃ¼ls there two 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.870
 times over the yawn icon there by 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.000
 in the first installment of the tutorial we configure our and for this the mode 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.770
 count then on this occasion as already mentioned, let's move on to share 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.740
 the public ip address 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.250
 is one of the advantages that we will have with this base selection in the section 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.330
 advanced 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.300
 let's see what we swim adding a motion 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.200
 as through which we will be able to open ports in which our router 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.900
 good as has been said we go to internet 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.900
 by the way here on the internet we select 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.640
 min shared with injury 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.940
 we go to selected compass shares a public ip address gives it is 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.670
 now we need and do not know htp akin detail kosove comment if you leave 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.230
 go the default parameters that have not welcomed us cured percent in 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.850
 the utility from there for this one thing happens that this number in this range 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.060
 of ip is going to match that having control that has the routing of the 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.230
 operators so for now that we want to update for 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.380
 past changes let's see what this notice gives us 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.410
 to select obese through the internet 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.310
 we take other areas fp and we do one thing changed its rank and p here had 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.290
 holds scola 10 points 0 or 1 7 2 points 16 Andalusian until more therefore 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:55.610
 which already select 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.110
 it was a thing as I say in your case bbk who verdun two drinks out 1 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.450
 in the initial direction of hcp 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.350
 good to what explains why 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.459
 this means that here of the first act of said ideas and nothing to the 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.389
 ordered to be by esteban is going to be 

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:14.509
 1 7 2 points 16 points 1 2 

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:17.509
 the final ip address here you can set the number of 

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:21.430
 why I have seven 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.430
 so if the team why each route and for this one 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.430
 but you can not modify only 154 cession of hcp this is the time that goes 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.780
 to last in the delight assignment in while I had connected your 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.459
 then omar cook pc what of whatever 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:37.900
 acpt reservation 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.920
 this very important section and here should it be at least 

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:46.249
 Regarding a reservation in case any and felipe stop and extinguished as you see 

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:47.599
 I have money 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:51.319
 the direction that ends in a father and therefore yes in this way that if 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.449
 turn off football auf attend 

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:54.729
 I will avoid 

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:57.629
 that I change the ip address and therefore 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:01.279
 percent and treatment or slogans in the configuration we have 

00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:05.560
 It is recommended that the iss company address an ip address for 

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:08.559
 impose and in the case of having a thousand people will be essential 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.809
 believe that you also reserve and its the ip address for good printer 

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:16.519
 or they are defecting from ip so that I would not make a defeat here we give 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.339
 to update 

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:22.209
 mother p this is one of the faults that I see readers without every time 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.859
 We want to make effective changes that we have made, we have to dedicate 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.989
 start but good what are we going to do that continuous 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.009
 and we are waiting for you 

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:38.129
 here normally it gives me I do not know if this is a mistake today it is normal that it takes 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:38.849
 in 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:41.570
 in recognizing the router by a hundred 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:47.079
 Arming gale several times and there says that yes I notice object highlights the utility 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:48.789
 and neither the factory 

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:51.239
 I do not know if it's my bottle 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.930
 or it's a normal thing because the autoity there's cover 

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:59.909
 in making the changes effective and therefore it produces some 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:01.549
 a firecracker e 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:03.549
 the identification of the device 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:06.829
 Well, if this happens to you, what pleads more minds than I close 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:09.810
 I come back again April alliance and for 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.819
 and normally 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.749
 just that you should know what the cut you have seen 

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:17.449
 straight away the unknown 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:20.689
 no I do not think it's a failure collaboration walk you know 

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:24.439
 ferra those letters brings par excellence is good because he called it realized 

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:25.129
 the change 

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:28.479
 we already have our public ip address to be shared 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.360
 and now the detail had told them if we are not going forward 

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:36.779
 let's see what we have 

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:41.159
 a new section that this port assignment from which we can open 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:42.000
 ports 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.639
 for example for ap roma ap and tupi program from chalaco cooke whatever 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.389
 I in this case because I have this mission is skin and tibi 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.100
 is debated in the French polysemic edit button since the scenario 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.449
 of all 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:02.659
 this very simple simply in all castilla that put ports 

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:06.939
 introduce this four times the same the number of the porto that said law 

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:10.139
 and in private ip address you have to put the equipment 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:13.139
 he thinks he's going to, for example, download and even 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.699
 it does not have a secret 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:20.749
 for without some way service powers as it is logical that you want hamas 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.800
 i good here something like this happens for example is to reconfigure the emule for example from 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.620
 mulago mourning rembe know what is here you have it 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.990
 was selected the bourbon protocol service that voted once more 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.730
 It seems 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:36.430
 and then the only thing about coffee is that you modify and number 

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:40.349
 of ports and and perfectly what baeza 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:43.849
 Well, now 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:46.599
 per cent the only one left until 1 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:47.759
 a small or 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:49.219
 a little advice 

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:53.809
 it is very normal that the light of the ember denver router when you perform is 

00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:56.259
 this configuration get to work 

00:05:56.259 --> 00:05:57.319
 for it 

00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:01.239
 prisoner is a state like bargain and where they put the double 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:05.949
 which polino give them injuries this does not affect at all in the performance of 

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:08.900
 of the suterm and in the internet connection or anything 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.810
 best investigating why he did not die here I've asked for wells you do 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:17.020
 if the color is the same as revealed by the hour and nothing but I am very fussy 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.389
 and I like 

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:20.309
 have things as they are 

00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:22.999
 a kiss the selectors 

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:26.110
 marquez ignore the problem here and up 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.349
 right away the green room magnifying glass 

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:32.499
 the sane this worries us that it will not affect at all in it in the 

00:06:32.499 --> 00:06:36.430
 boston performance for this one at the time that I know I have hit him 

00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:38.509
 with the problem of the data speak 

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:41.800
 can do and another tutorial there villa I'll explain 

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:48.139
 well nothing that exceed tutorial and another you can see in the blog to the mac 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:48.930
 Delhi 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:51.069
 point there were three points as 

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:51.499
 see you later
