don't<00:06:22.900> cut<00:06:23.080> this<00:06:23.229> line<00:06:23.470> that's<00:06:23.680> your

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 
don't cut this line that's your

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.770 
don't cut this line that's your

sampling<00:07:02.400> beer<00:07:04.880> over<00:07:05.880> here<00:07:06.090> we've<00:07:06.240> got<00:07:06.270> the

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:06.480 
sampling beer over here we've got the

grain mill be motorized eventually right
now<00:07:11.790> this<00:07:11.940> works<00:07:12.240> just<00:07:12.450> fine

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.960 
now this works just fine

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:18.470 
now this works just fine

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:18.480 
use this clamp trigger in stairs you can

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:24.370 
use this clamp trigger in stairs you can
adjust<00:07:18.780> the<00:07:18.870> speed<00:07:19.110> really<00:07:19.440> easily<00:07:19.710> with<00:07:19.950> that

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:34.110 

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:36.110 

that's<00:07:34.919> work<00:07:35.129> that<00:07:35.159> until<00:07:35.639> I<00:07:35.669> get<00:07:35.819> some<00:07:36.000> more

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:36.120 
that's work that until I get some more

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:40.970 
that's work that until I get some more
material

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:40.980 

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.610
