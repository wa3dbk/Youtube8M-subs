00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440
 hello to you andrew andreevich my 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:10.139
 All site-all dot ru 1280 5 task 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:15.890
 what part of a cubic meter is 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:19.230
 under the letter a 1 liter 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:22.769
 let's translate the liter first 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:26.460
 decimeters 1 liter equals one decimeter 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.830
 cubic further we need now 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:35.460
 cubic decimeter to convert to meters 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:39.149
 cubic in one meter cubic 1000 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.399
 children of cubic grass therefore 1 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.680
 cubic decimeter is only 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:49.620
 one thousandth of cubic meters 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:58.260
 then 1 liter is one thousandth 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:01:06.030
 cubic meters beyond 10 decimeters 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:09.210
 cubic 10 cubic decimeters well 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:14.040
 see here you can write for example in 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:17.729
 decimal fractions we already spoke with 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.470
 you that one cubic meter 1000 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.200
 gypsum cubic meters 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:26.130
 and we have such 10 pieces that is possible 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:30.210
 write down 10 thousandths 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.979
 cubic meters i.e. if 1 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.509
 cubic decimeter is one thousandth 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.500
 cubic meter 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.600
 then 10 10 cubic meters it is already 10 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.780
 thousandths if we write it in the form 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:49.070
 decimal fraction that we get here 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:51.570
 so 10 thousandths of cubic meters 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:55.700
 Extremely 0, in principle, we can not drop 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.700
 write then we have one hundredth 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:04.920
 1,100 cubic meters well or if we 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:09.860
 We want to write a fraction of one hundredth 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:20.760
 cubic meter that is either like this 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:28.680
 or like that on which we have successfully 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:33.300
 lost 100 liters 100 liters 100 liters 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:37.470
 it is 100 cubic decimeters it means 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:40.950
 we all get that thousandths of a meter 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.989
 cubic because when we 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.910
 translate plaintiff cubic meters 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.959
 convert to cubic meters we divide by 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.920
 1000 if we are in decimal form 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:57.450
 for want to write 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:03:00.690
 that we will have one hundred thousandths of you 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:04.380
 it turned out that thousandths two extreme 0 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.980
 we can basically drop 1 10 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.450
 cubic meters 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:15.239
 it was possible to explain in another way 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:17.430
 we had 100 cubic decimeters 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.850
 to ride meters translate to meters 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.340
 cubic divide by a thousand when 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:29.370
 divide by 1000 comma we transfer by 3 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:32.670
 sign two times three here in the beginning 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:38.820
 write zero extremely 20 we drop one 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:45.230
 tenth but we wrote 1 10 and 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:45.230
 we still have the letter r 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:58.010
 100 centimeters of cubic let's 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:01.470
 this time the comma will be 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.630
 use we want from centimeters 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.420
 cubic to start translate to 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.069
 decibeters are ubiotic if we're from 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.709
 centimeters cubic translated to 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.959
 cubic decimetres what we do we 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.720
 divide by a thousand because in diameter 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.549
 cubic you 1000 centimeters 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.200
 cubic so that 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.320
 and centimeters convert to decimeter and 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:25.260
 divide by a thousand how easy and fast 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.440
 divide by a thousand here you are an integer 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:34.190
 at his end when divide by 1000 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:38.479
 comma is transferred to 3 characters two three times 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:40.740
 here, two extreme 0 can be discarded 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:45.990
 one tenth is obtained 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:49.340
 and then we are from nice cubic meters 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:53.729
 want to convert to cubic meters 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:55.740
 Now we have this situation and we 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:58.229
 izdets and cubic meters translated to 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.979
 cubic meters i.e. divide by another 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:08.090
 thousand dash , still transferred to 3 characters 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:10.979
 1 2 3 in empty spaces append zeros 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:14.190
 so, here it was yes before edinichka 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:19.400
 before Genich Kai we transfer another 3 characters 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:24.390
 two or three times like that turns one 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:26.789
 ten thousandth one thousandth of a meter 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:29.550
 cubic i think what to take in 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:33.960
 decimal fractions easiest to record 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:35.780
 Of course on this all write to 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.620
 comments everything was clear 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:41.450
 advise my videos to friends and 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.450
 classmate all bye
