00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:27.619
 I have the images in this case 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.619
 watching rising surprise 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.429
 I rarely have 

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:36.459

 what started as a nice sporting encounter 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.890
 and that in an explosion according to 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.420
 senseless violence 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.670

 conditional if it is up to justice 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.740
 the suspects deny that the crime said they have committed that 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.580

 face the storm he says 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:37.330
 but the public prosecutor does not agree 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.240
 Willem for doors for that reason 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.730

 and also the vice-president of haaglandia he was acquitted 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:13.149
 but then due to lack of evidence 

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:16.779
 the conflicting statements from witnesses he would be a spectator one 

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:20.699
