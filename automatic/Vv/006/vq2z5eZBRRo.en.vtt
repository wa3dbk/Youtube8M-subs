parallax<00:01:42.659> so<00:01:43.229> we<00:01:43.380> have<00:01:43.740> all<00:01:43.950> these<00:01:44.100> situations

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
parallax so we have all these situations

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.630 
parallax so we have all these situations
where<00:01:44.909> heroes<00:01:45.180> became<00:01:45.780> villains<00:01:46.520> but<00:01:47.520> the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
where heroes became villains but the

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.929 
where heroes became villains but the
point<00:01:47.820> is<00:01:48.259> they<00:01:49.259> don't<00:01:49.470> always<00:01:49.619> stay<00:01:50.430> villains

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
point is they don't always stay villains

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.039 
point is they don't always stay villains
it's<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.720> short-term<00:01:52.020> thing<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.740> then<00:01:54.049> they

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
it's a short-term thing and then they

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.170 
it's a short-term thing and then they
see<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.350> light<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:56.009> riverbed<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:57.090> is

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
see the light and a riverbed so that is

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.359 
see the light and a riverbed so that is
a<00:01:57.210> problem<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.810> question<00:01:58.530> was<00:01:59.040> kind<00:01:59.310> of

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
a problem that the question was kind of

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.010 
a problem that the question was kind of
were<00:01:59.729> there<00:01:59.939> any<00:02:00.119> heroes<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.659> actually

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
were there any heroes that actually

were there any heroes that actually
stayed<00:02:01.350> villains<00:02:01.860> we<00:02:02.310> don't<00:02:02.490> really<00:02:02.579> see<00:02:02.820> that

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
stayed villains we don't really see that

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.410 
stayed villains we don't really see that
that<00:02:03.180> often<00:02:03.509> fill<00:02:03.960> yer<00:02:04.229> now<00:02:04.619> it's<00:02:05.549> it's<00:02:06.000> likely

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
that often fill yer now it's it's likely
