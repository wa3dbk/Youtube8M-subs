00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.899 
smooth it feels moisturize after it
feels<00:01:45.780> fresh<00:01:46.079> okay<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.740> would<00:01:46.979> use<00:01:47.369> this<00:01:47.610> on

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
feels fresh okay so I would use this on

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.569 
feels fresh okay so I would use this on
my<00:01:48.329> site<00:01:48.540> of<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.810> week<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.439> probably<00:01:50.250> two<00:01:50.460> to

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
my site of the week and probably two to

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.030 
my site of the week and probably two to
three<00:01:50.610> nights<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.600> would<00:01:51.899> be<00:01:52.200> safest<00:01:52.470> if<00:01:52.890> they

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
three nights I would be safest if they

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.639 
three nights I would be safest if they
scrub<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:54.450> know<00:01:54.600> many<00:01:54.810> people<00:01:54.869> would<00:01:55.290> use<00:01:55.470> a

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
scrub and I know many people would use a

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.359 
scrub and I know many people would use a
wash<00:01:56.060> after<00:01:57.060> this<00:01:57.240> but<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.600> find<00:01:58.219> what<00:01:59.219> she's

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
wash after this but I find what she's

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.310 
wash after this but I find what she's
really<00:01:59.579> cost<00:01:59.969> my<00:02:00.240> face<00:02:00.450> inside<00:02:00.810> sensitive

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
really cost my face inside sensitive

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.590 
really cost my face inside sensitive
skin<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:01.890> he's<00:02:02.610> gonna<00:02:02.759> wash<00:02:03.000> every<00:02:03.299> single

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
skin and he's gonna wash every single

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.020 
skin and he's gonna wash every single
night<00:02:03.780> would<00:02:04.020> really<00:02:04.320> strip<00:02:04.770> away<00:02:05.250> the

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
night would really strip away the

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.119 
night would really strip away the
natural<00:02:06.149> oils<00:02:06.659> in<00:02:06.719> my<00:02:06.840> face<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.979> would

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
natural oils in my face and it would

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.109 
natural oils in my face and it would
make<00:02:08.250> me<00:02:08.399> break<00:02:08.670> out<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.910> lot<00:02:09.270> so<00:02:09.780> this

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
make me break out a lot so this

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.470 
make me break out a lot so this
perfect<00:02:10.450> for<00:02:10.569> me<00:02:10.659> cuz<00:02:10.810> it's<00:02:10.929> nice<00:02:11.080> and<00:02:11.260> gentle

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
perfect for me cuz it's nice and gentle

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.610 
perfect for me cuz it's nice and gentle
and<00:02:13.480> it<00:02:13.690> doesn't<00:02:13.900> make<00:02:13.989> you<00:02:14.080> break<00:02:14.290> out<00:02:14.440> I'm

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
and it doesn't make you break out I'm

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.559 
and it doesn't make you break out I'm
fine<00:02:14.799> but<00:02:15.010> it<00:02:15.129> just<00:02:15.250> really<00:02:15.879> suits<00:02:16.360> my<00:02:16.510> skin

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
fine but it just really suits my skin

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.050 
fine but it just really suits my skin

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.880 
down so basically I love this stuff is
quick<00:02:19.330> it's<00:02:19.599> easy<00:02:19.900> and<00:02:20.170> I'll<00:02:20.590> definitely

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
quick it's easy and I'll definitely

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.520 
quick it's easy and I'll definitely
recommend<00:02:21.489> for<00:02:21.700> my<00:02:21.849> dry<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:22.510> normal<00:02:22.989> skin

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
recommend for my dry to normal skin

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.830 
recommend for my dry to normal skin
girls<00:02:23.739> but<00:02:24.099> I<00:02:24.370> wouldn't<00:02:25.000> recommend<00:02:25.120> for<00:02:25.540> oily

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
girls but I wouldn't recommend for oily

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.619 
girls but I wouldn't recommend for oily
because<00:02:25.989> it<00:02:26.739> is<00:02:26.920> quite<00:02:27.519> oily<00:02:27.700> itself<00:02:28.239> and<00:02:28.480> it

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 
because it is quite oily itself and it

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:31.170 
because it is quite oily itself and it
does<00:02:28.810> be<00:02:29.110> full<00:02:29.890> of<00:02:30.159> eggs<00:02:30.370> residue<00:02:30.909> on<00:02:31.090> your

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
does be full of eggs residue on your

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.509 
does be full of eggs residue on your
skin<00:02:31.629> which<00:02:31.900> I<00:02:32.140> personally<00:02:32.680> love<00:02:33.159> because<00:02:33.190> I

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
skin which I personally love because I

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.180 
skin which I personally love because I
have<00:02:33.670> dry<00:02:33.909> skin<00:02:34.239> one<00:02:35.110> combat<00:02:35.530> I<00:02:35.590> would<00:02:35.769> say<00:02:35.950> and

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
have dry skin one combat I would say and

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.100 
have dry skin one combat I would say and
I<00:02:36.280> think<00:02:36.310> what<00:02:36.940> they<00:02:37.030> need<00:02:37.239> to<00:02:37.360> improve<00:02:37.450> on<00:02:37.900> is

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
I think what they need to improve on is

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.170 
I think what they need to improve on is
maybe<00:02:38.349> the<00:02:38.829> bottle<00:02:39.159> hasn't<00:02:39.489> is<00:02:39.640> pumped

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
maybe the bottle hasn't is pumped

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.009 
maybe the bottle hasn't is pumped
because<00:02:40.870> of<00:02:40.989> the<00:02:41.079> consistency<00:02:41.890> is<00:02:42.160> quiet<00:02:42.549> only

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
because of the consistency is quiet only

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.119 
because of the consistency is quiet only
slipperiness<00:02:44.019> of<00:02:44.140> my<00:02:44.230> that's<00:02:44.470> I<00:02:44.620> think<00:02:44.680> a<00:02:44.920> pop

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:45.129 
slipperiness of my that's I think a pop

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:48.360 
slipperiness of my that's I think a pop
of<00:02:45.310> these<00:02:45.489> way<00:02:45.940> there<00:02:46.180> are<00:02:46.329> other<00:02:47.310> than<00:02:48.310> that

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
of these way there are other than that

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.099 
of these way there are other than that
it's<00:02:48.700> amazing<00:02:49.000> I<00:02:49.359> would<00:02:49.480> definitely<00:02:49.870> do<00:02:49.989> get

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
it's amazing I would definitely do get

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.349 
it's amazing I would definitely do get
