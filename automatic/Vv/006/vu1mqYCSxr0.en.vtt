I<00:00:00.120> should<00:00:00.989> briefly<00:00:01.319> mention<00:00:01.740> at<00:00:01.829> this<00:00:01.920> point

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
I should briefly mention at this point

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.789 
I should briefly mention at this point
that<00:00:02.460> I<00:00:02.669> really<00:00:03.149> don't<00:00:03.360> think<00:00:03.449> in<00:00:03.810> Italy<00:00:04.620> can

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
that I really don't think in Italy can

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.369 
that I really don't think in Italy can
hurt<00:00:05.009> you<00:00:05.220> let's<00:00:06.060> say<00:00:06.270> there<00:00:06.540> they<00:00:06.960> go<00:00:07.109> all-out

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
hurt you let's say there they go all-out

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.080 
hurt you let's say there they go all-out
gunning<00:00:07.919> for<00:00:07.950> you<00:00:08.340> in<00:00:08.570> 401<00:00:10.250> and<00:00:11.250> they<00:00:11.610> say<00:00:11.849> did

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
gunning for you in 401 and they say did

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.390 
gunning for you in 401 and they say did
go<00:00:12.269> for<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:12.540> Gascony<00:00:13.080> type<00:00:13.710> opening<00:00:14.130> you<00:00:14.250> went

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
go for a Gascony type opening you went

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.029 
go for a Gascony type opening you went
this<00:00:14.519> way<00:00:15.529> so<00:00:16.529> what<00:00:17.869> at<00:00:18.869> worst<00:00:19.230> you<00:00:19.560> can<00:00:19.770> do<00:00:20.010> a

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
this way so what at worst you can do a

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.550 
this way so what at worst you can do a
self<00:00:20.400> standoff<00:00:21.000> here<00:00:21.410> guaranteeing<00:00:22.410> that

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
self standoff here guaranteeing that

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.189 
self standoff here guaranteeing that
that<00:00:22.859> is<00:00:22.980> left<00:00:23.220> free<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:24.180> move<00:00:24.359> into<00:00:24.539> Portugal

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
that is left free and move into Portugal

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.380 
that is left free and move into Portugal
if<00:00:25.710> that's<00:00:25.980> your<00:00:26.160> only<00:00:26.189> worry<00:00:26.580> of<00:00:26.880> course<00:00:27.150> if

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
if that's your only worry of course if

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.910 
if that's your only worry of course if
you're<00:00:27.570> attacked<00:00:27.900> on<00:00:28.050> multiple<00:00:28.500> borders

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
you're attacked on multiple borders

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.130 
you're attacked on multiple borders
you've<00:00:29.519> got<00:00:29.730> headaches<00:00:30.090> regardless<00:00:30.960> of

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
you've got headaches regardless of

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.450 
you've got headaches regardless of
combination<00:00:31.880> so<00:00:32.880> that's<00:00:33.210> not<00:00:33.450> very<00:00:33.690> effective

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
combination so that's not very effective

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.270 
combination so that's not very effective
if<00:00:35.460> they<00:00:35.640> continue<00:00:36.090> their<00:00:36.300> madcap<00:00:37.200> plan<00:00:37.530> then

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
if they continue their madcap plan then

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.940 
if they continue their madcap plan then
they<00:00:39.270> can<00:00:39.450> be<00:00:39.570> in<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.750> Gulf<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.079> leon's<00:00:40.469> by<00:00:40.890> the

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
they can be in the Gulf of leon's by the

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.660 
they can be in the Gulf of leon's by the
end<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.690> 1901<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:43.320> what<00:00:43.590> you've<00:00:44.100> bounced<00:00:44.550> off

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
end of 1901 so what you've bounced off

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.150 
end of 1901 so what you've bounced off
again<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:46.140> build<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.500> fleet<00:00:46.770> there<00:00:47.039> if

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
again that you build the fleet there if

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.970 
again that you build the fleet there if
you<00:00:47.280> like<00:00:47.750> you<00:00:48.750> can<00:00:48.899> start<00:00:49.320> sending<00:00:49.559> fleets

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
you like you can start sending fleets

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.000 
you like you can start sending fleets
round<00:00:50.510> doesn't<00:00:51.510> bother<00:00:51.660> me<00:00:51.899> at<00:00:51.989> all<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.440> more

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
round doesn't bother me at all a more

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.310 
round doesn't bother me at all a more
disguised<00:00:53.610> Italian<00:00:54.300> attack<00:00:54.600> may<00:00:54.899> be<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.110> bit

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
disguised Italian attack may be a bit

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.650 
disguised Italian attack may be a bit
more<00:00:55.469> dangerous<00:00:55.680> I<00:00:56.219> mean<00:00:56.730> if<00:00:56.969> they<00:00:57.120> open<00:00:57.510> like

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
more dangerous I mean if they open like

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.349 
more dangerous I mean if they open like
this<00:00:57.870> for<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.260> stands<00:00:58.739> there<00:00:58.980> like<00:00:59.129> that

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 
this for that stands there like that

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:02.510 
this for that stands there like that
convoys<00:01:00.359> in<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.930> then<00:01:01.050> build<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.710> fleet<00:01:01.949> Naples

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
convoys in and then build a fleet Naples

convoys in and then build a fleet Naples
you<00:01:02.879> could<00:01:03.090> still<00:01:03.449> be<00:01:03.660> thinking<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.379> they're

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
you could still be thinking that they're

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.250 
you could still be thinking that they're
going<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.799> go<00:01:04.920> Turkey's<00:01:05.489> way<00:01:05.810> then<00:01:06.810> they<00:01:07.020> could

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
going to go Turkey's way then they could

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.149 
going to go Turkey's way then they could
surprise<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.580> with<00:01:09.439> this<00:01:10.439> kind<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.830> thing<00:01:11.040> in

surprise you with this kind of thing in
the<00:01:11.250> next<00:01:11.369> move<00:01:12.200> that<00:01:13.430> if<00:01:14.430> they've<00:01:14.610> got<00:01:14.760> a

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
the next move that if they've got a

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.070 
the next move that if they've got a
great<00:01:15.030> relationship<00:01:15.270> with<00:01:15.630> Austria<00:01:16.020> that

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
great relationship with Austria that

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.100 
great relationship with Austria that
could<00:01:16.439> then<00:01:16.650> move<00:01:16.890> there<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.960> they're<00:01:18.960> now

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
could then move there and they're now

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.340 
could then move there and they're now
supporting<00:01:20.100> fleets<00:01:20.549> in<00:01:21.080> it's<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.170> cause

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
supporting fleets in it's a cause

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
the game should be a 2v2 fleet situation

the game should be a 2v2 fleet situation
it<00:01:27.420> still<00:01:28.070> recognizes<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.100> very<00:01:29.369> slow<00:01:29.700> attack

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030
