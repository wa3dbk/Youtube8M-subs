00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.839 
looking for the keys because guys ashot
lost<00:02:30.910> of<00:02:31.150> course<00:02:31.420> lost<00:02:31.810> them<00:02:32.549> we<00:02:33.549> got<00:02:33.700> in<00:02:33.790> the

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
lost of course lost them we got in the

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.670 
lost of course lost them we got in the
car<00:02:34.000> and<00:02:34.120> I<00:02:34.150> drove<00:02:34.209> it<00:02:34.450> home<00:02:34.569> and<00:02:36.390> turns<00:02:37.390> out

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
car and I drove it home and turns out

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:44.850 
car and I drove it home and turns out
that<00:02:38.680> I<00:02:38.739> have<00:02:39.010> a<00:02:39.040> a<00:02:40.290> code<00:02:41.489> p0<00:02:42.599> 742<00:02:43.620> you<00:02:44.620> know<00:02:44.769> the

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
that I have a a code p0 742 you know the

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.339 
that I have a a code p0 742 you know the
transmission<00:02:45.400> was<00:02:45.519> just<00:02:45.700> acting<00:02:46.000> funny<00:02:46.180> and

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
transmission was just acting funny and

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.630 
transmission was just acting funny and
so<00:02:47.349> I<00:02:47.410> could<00:02:47.590> feel<00:02:47.739> it<00:02:47.829> on<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:47.980> way<00:02:48.099> back<00:02:48.250> and

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
so I could feel it on the way back and

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.059 
so I could feel it on the way back and
it<00:02:49.450> wasn't<00:02:49.630> good<00:02:49.900> and<00:02:50.110> turns<00:02:50.530> out<00:02:50.739> that<00:02:50.920> that's

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
it wasn't good and turns out that that's

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:52.910 
it wasn't good and turns out that that's
a<00:02:51.250> torque<00:02:51.700> converter<00:02:51.730> clutch<00:02:52.180> solenoid

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
a torque converter clutch solenoid

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.319 
a torque converter clutch solenoid
sticking<00:02:53.920> on<00:02:54.069> so<00:02:54.660> I'm<00:02:55.660> hoping<00:02:56.019> that<00:02:56.230> it's<00:02:57.329> that

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
sticking on so I'm hoping that it's that

00:02:58.329 --> 00:02:59.819 
sticking on so I'm hoping that it's that
I<00:02:58.360> can<00:02:58.599> just<00:02:58.780> change<00:02:58.989> the<00:02:59.140> fluid<00:02:59.290> and<00:02:59.470> filter

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
I can just change the fluid and filter

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:01.289 
I can just change the fluid and filter
and<00:02:59.860> it'll<00:03:00.220> take<00:03:00.370> care<00:03:00.400> of<00:03:00.700> it<00:03:00.790> at<00:03:00.970> least<00:03:01.120> for<00:03:01.269> a

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
and it'll take care of it at least for a

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:04.140 
and it'll take care of it at least for a
little<00:03:01.360> while<00:03:01.540> but<00:03:02.340> you<00:03:03.340> know<00:03:03.370> I<00:03:03.459> might<00:03:03.640> try<00:03:03.910> a

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
little while but you know I might try a

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.490 
little while but you know I might try a
little<00:03:04.360> additive<00:03:04.840> or<00:03:04.959> something<00:03:05.319> in<00:03:05.410> it

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
little additive or something in it

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.530 
little additive or something in it
normally<00:03:05.860> I<00:03:05.890> wouldn't<00:03:06.160> do<00:03:06.250> that<00:03:06.459> but<00:03:06.670> things

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
normally I wouldn't do that but things

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.940 
normally I wouldn't do that but things
got<00:03:08.400> 230,000<00:03:09.400> on<00:03:09.519> it<00:03:09.610> almost<00:03:09.910> and<00:03:10.360> I<00:03:10.950> don't

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
got 230,000 on it almost and I don't

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.160 
got 230,000 on it almost and I don't
have<00:03:12.280> the<00:03:12.400> time<00:03:12.579> to<00:03:12.610> take<00:03:13.510> take<00:03:13.989> the

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
have the time to take take the

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.930 
have the time to take take the
transmission<00:03:14.500> out<00:03:14.890> and<00:03:15.129> fix<00:03:15.310> everything<00:03:15.610> so

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
transmission out and fix everything so

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.210 
transmission out and fix everything so
I'm<00:03:16.720> gonna<00:03:16.870> try<00:03:17.079> that<00:03:17.109> give<00:03:17.799> that<00:03:17.980> a<00:03:18.010> shot

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
I'm gonna try that give that a shot

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.430 
I'm gonna try that give that a shot
that'll<00:03:18.609> be<00:03:18.700> probably<00:03:19.660> another<00:03:19.750> two<00:03:20.019> weeks<00:03:20.170> so

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
that'll be probably another two weeks so

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.030 
that'll be probably another two weeks so
I'll<00:03:20.590> be<00:03:20.709> back<00:03:20.859> in<00:03:21.040> Iowa<00:03:22.590> in<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:23.620> next<00:03:23.920> two

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040

things<00:03:30.370> fixed<00:03:30.609> and<00:03:31.180> there's<00:03:31.420> of<00:03:31.540> course<00:03:31.569> if

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
things fixed and there's of course if

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.550 
things fixed and there's of course if
nobody<00:03:32.290> else's<00:03:32.620> stuff<00:03:32.829> breaks<00:03:33.840> but<00:03:34.840> you<00:03:35.410> can

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
nobody else's stuff breaks but you can

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.599 
nobody else's stuff breaks but you can
look<00:03:35.650> forward<00:03:35.859> to<00:03:35.950> that<00:03:36.130> in<00:03:36.160> a<00:03:36.250> couple<00:03:36.310> weeks
