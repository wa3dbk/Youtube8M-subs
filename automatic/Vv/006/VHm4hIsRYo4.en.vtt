00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
came right directly behind him and I

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.889 
came right directly behind him and I
really<00:01:50.880> messed<00:01:51.030> up<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.329> didn't<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.720> wasn't

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
really messed up I didn't I wasn't

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.980 
really messed up I didn't I wasn't
blacked<00:01:52.229> out<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:53.360> that<00:01:54.360> bird<00:01:54.570> saw<00:01:54.810> my

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
blacked out and that bird saw my

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.810 
blacked out and that bird saw my
movement<00:01:55.409> right<00:01:55.560> away<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:55.890> he<00:01:55.979> took<00:01:56.159> off<00:01:56.369> LARM

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
movement right away and he took off LARM

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.810 
movement right away and he took off LARM
puttings<00:01:57.210> as<00:01:57.450> fast<00:01:57.689> as<00:01:57.869> could<00:01:57.990> be<00:01:58.219> so<00:01:59.219> that<00:01:59.729> was

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
puttings as fast as could be so that was

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.399 
puttings as fast as could be so that was
a<00:01:59.850> hard<00:01:59.969> lesson<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.270> learn<00:02:00.360> but<00:02:00.750> now<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.140> always

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
a hard lesson to learn but now I always

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.679 
a hard lesson to learn but now I always
wear<00:02:02.009> black<00:02:02.040> ops<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:02.909> black<00:02:03.149> myself<00:02:03.509> out

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
wear black ops and I black myself out

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.240 
wear black ops and I black myself out
it's<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.409> best<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:04.649> my<00:02:04.740> ability<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.130> we've

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
it's the best of my ability and we've

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.530 
it's the best of my ability and we've
had<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.399> lot<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:05.579> success<00:02:05.939> with<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.240> you

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
had a lot of success with that you

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.999 
had a lot of success with that you
should<00:02:06.719> try<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:06.930> too<00:02:08.450> another<00:02:09.450> tip<00:02:09.690> is<00:02:09.899> when<00:02:10.560> we

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
should try it too another tip is when we

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.619 
should try it too another tip is when we
walk<00:02:11.190> out<00:02:11.370> in<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.489> field<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:12.030> we<00:02:12.209> place<00:02:12.450> our

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
walk out in the field and we place our

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.550 
walk out in the field and we place our
blind

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
right next to a fence or an opening you

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.150 
right next to a fence or an opening you
can<00:02:18.690> actually<00:02:19.140> have<00:02:19.260> that<00:02:19.380> blind<00:02:19.680> at<00:02:20.010> in<00:02:20.099> the

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
and middle of strutting zone even

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.460 
and middle of strutting zone even
because<00:02:33.330> those<00:02:33.480> birds<00:02:33.780> aren't<00:02:34.110> going<00:02:34.260> to<00:02:34.319> shy

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
because those birds aren't going to shy

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.660 
because those birds aren't going to shy
from<00:02:34.709> it<00:02:34.860> they're<00:02:35.010> gonna<00:02:35.069> concentrate<00:02:35.489> on

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
from it they're gonna concentrate on

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.770 
from it they're gonna concentrate on
that<00:02:35.849> decoy<00:02:37.760> another<00:02:38.760> tip<00:02:39.030> to<00:02:39.060> remember<00:02:39.599> is

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
that decoy another tip to remember is

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.080 
that decoy another tip to remember is
when<00:02:40.470> setting<00:02:40.830> up<00:02:40.920> your<00:02:40.980> blind<00:02:41.400> if<00:02:41.670> you<00:02:41.940> know

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
when setting up your blind if you know

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.970 
when setting up your blind if you know
where<00:02:42.239> those<00:02:42.360> birds<00:02:42.690> are<00:02:42.810> roosting<00:02:43.050> at<00:02:43.410> you

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
where those birds are roosting at you

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.070 
where those birds are roosting at you
want<00:02:44.160> to<00:02:44.250> try<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.459> set<00:02:44.670> yourself<00:02:44.819> up<00:02:45.269> in<00:02:45.750> a

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
want to try to set yourself up in a

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.080 
want to try to set yourself up in a
place<00:02:46.380> where<00:02:46.709> that<00:02:47.069> wind<00:02:47.310> is<00:02:47.549> blowing<00:02:47.819> if<00:02:48.000> you

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
place where that wind is blowing if you

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.370 
place where that wind is blowing if you
have<00:02:48.209> a<00:02:48.239> high<00:02:48.450> wind<00:02:48.660> those<00:02:48.900> birds<00:02:49.170> are

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
have a high wind those birds are

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.620 
have a high wind those birds are
probably<00:02:49.739> gonna<00:02:49.890> land<00:02:50.250> going<00:02:50.880> into<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.450> wind

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
probably gonna land going into the wind

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.509 
probably gonna land going into the wind
so<00:02:51.870> that's<00:02:52.200> another<00:02:52.440> factor<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.069> keep<00:02:53.190> in<00:02:53.340> mind

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
so that's another factor to keep in mind

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.770 
so that's another factor to keep in mind
when<00:02:53.730> setting<00:02:54.090> up<00:02:56.299> we<00:02:57.299> like<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:57.540> put<00:02:57.690> our

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
when setting up we like to put our

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.050 
when setting up we like to put our
decoys<00:02:58.140> at<00:02:58.260> about<00:02:58.440> seven<00:02:58.860> yards<00:02:59.250> so<00:02:59.819> what<00:02:59.970> we

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
decoys at about seven yards so what we

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.000 
decoys at about seven yards so what we
do<00:03:00.180> is<00:03:00.330> we<00:03:00.450> place<00:03:00.660> our<00:03:00.840> decoys<00:03:01.170> first<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:01.860> then

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
do is we place our decoys first and then

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.770 
do is we place our decoys first and then
we'll<00:03:02.190> step<00:03:02.400> off<00:03:02.580> seven<00:03:02.970> yards<00:03:03.330> and<00:03:03.540> em<00:03:03.630> we'll

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
we'll step off seven yards and em we'll

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.170 
we'll step off seven yards and em we'll
set<00:03:03.959> our<00:03:03.989> blind<00:03:04.319> and<00:03:04.590> always<00:03:05.519> with<00:03:05.910> the<00:03:06.000> Sun

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
behind our back that way gives us ample

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.789 
behind our back that way gives us ample
opportunity<00:03:09.180> to<00:03:09.330> get<00:03:09.720> that<00:03:09.840> bird<00:03:10.080> as<00:03:10.319> close<00:03:10.620> as
