00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.020
 not with this 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:17.599
 protest 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:24.199
 I help the company find environmentally sound solutions 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.829
 it is easy to note that this is the conclusion he followed 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:34.140
 the work of the consultants with regard to the environmental area accompanying the 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.180
 licensing process 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.910
 the leading company settling down somewhere is going to cause a 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.350
 heart attack 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.600
 environmental studies 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.150
 the biologists acnur 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.990
 the studies of the biotic environment 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.990
 and where can you get the licenses 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.440
 O 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.950
 school highlight 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:04.739
 and it was what he actually since I was little I always liked how many 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.430
 never 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.340
 I read papaya liked a tree is always very curious 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.570
 n 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.640
 he evaluates the children's conchinhas thing 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.050
 were teachers who have not yet been indicted as well 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.070
 then remove the talk or my mother actually wanted me to go to work 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.070
 as well as nurse in this nursing course 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.980
 design last time went live 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:37.660
 in college in physics the registration of the college entrance exam opting for ideology 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.630
 like long corn 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.350
 it has to have a good ability to prevent observation 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.760
 the referee has a facility and knows how to work both independently 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.930
 how integrated nixon how to produce and not only ate eggs but for 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.609
 professionals from other areas also 

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:15.359
 I would rather the researcher does all our staff is quite warm and 

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:20.049
 enough has a good ability to communicate 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.049
 of the study 

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:31.699
 It's satisfying for me. 

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:37.370
 helping the environment is rewarding for me by helping companies 

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:41.249
 we will find environmentally correct solutions
