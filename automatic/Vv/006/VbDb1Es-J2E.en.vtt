00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:10.559
 This time 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:13.390
 This was introduced to the six that gave me the day of this Sweet Pretty Cure 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.580
 I Bikkuratamago is a bowl and two eyes 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.990
 To say that the US military revenge yen 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.880
 Now 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:28.430
 There are a lot of people who want to work without difficulty 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:30.820
 I went just to look at it because I think that can be seen if you look at the last time of videos 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:35.910
 This time 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.910
 I think let's Ya immediately opened that the kana Let's do 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.710

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.660
 It would be nice if I could hear the sound this time 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.090
 That's right 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.910
 Not great 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.610
 Such a thing 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.610
 A damn I didn't visit the guitar for the rest 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.800
 The button is also before this 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.449
 that 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:06.240
 When I hit something, I told him that the white was the flow and advised me. 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.390
 I came out of something 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.550

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:17.320
 I 'll pick out the strange one 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.750
 An error does not come out at any time 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:25.990

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:28.670

 It 's easy, is n't it? 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:44.630
 I felt like this already appeared, I thought it would not come out anymore, though 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:49.490
 After all I ate silver I beat It is a ring of fit 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:51.090
 It seems that this moves by going to the bead holder 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:56.520
 When 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:59.140

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:12.370
 In it is there be such a feeling gonna lot of that child 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:15.569
 Hmm a little bit this is thin but it's dark when I have it cut 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.569
 I wonder if it is brassica 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:24.709
 It's a good smell that does n't fancy 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:28.239
 Yes this is a shot of that big head 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.239
 If there is a labo guitar in miniature 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:36.340

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:59.260
 road 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:00.790
 I wondered if it was a bit difficult to understand 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.069
 Ummm 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.580

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.120
 I want to 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:13.940
 Somewhat this is a seal or something 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:16.570
