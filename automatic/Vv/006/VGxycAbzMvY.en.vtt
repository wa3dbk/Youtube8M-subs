people in the competition have actually

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.710 
people in the competition have actually
liked<00:03:07.400> it<00:03:07.790> looks<00:03:08.000> like<00:03:08.120> they've<00:03:08.269> been<00:03:08.390> down

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720

liked it looks like they've been down
bow<00:03:09.019> in<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.500> actual<00:03:09.799> video<00:03:10.070> which<00:03:10.610> is<00:03:10.790> really

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
bow in the actual video which is really

bow in the actual video which is really
really<00:03:12.049> really<00:03:12.380> lame<00:03:13.180> so<00:03:14.180> I<00:03:14.209> think<00:03:14.299> that's

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
really really lame so I think that's

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.140

nothing<00:03:15.260> else<00:03:15.410> again<00:03:16.130> I<00:03:16.310> think<00:03:16.579> that's<00:03:16.730> really

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
nothing else again I think that's really

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
make it like they've got more of a

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.810 
make it like they've got more of a
chance<00:03:26.720> by<00:03:26.989> downvoting<00:03:27.829> other<00:03:28.070> people's

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
chance by downvoting other people's

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.030 
chance by downvoting other people's
videos<00:03:29.090> that's<00:03:29.840> not<00:03:30.019> how<00:03:30.140> this<00:03:30.350> works<00:03:30.650> that's

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
videos that's not how this works that's

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.410 
videos that's not how this works that's
not<00:03:31.130> gonna<00:03:31.340> affect<00:03:31.430> them<00:03:31.850> that's<00:03:32.060> just<00:03:32.269> being

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
not gonna affect them that's just being

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.569 
not gonna affect them that's just being
a<00:03:32.570> dickhead<00:03:33.019> so<00:03:33.560> what<00:03:33.739> I<00:03:33.769> think<00:03:33.920> you<00:03:34.400> should
