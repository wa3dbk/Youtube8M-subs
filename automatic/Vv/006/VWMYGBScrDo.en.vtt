and<00:00:34.010> those<00:00:34.670> a<00:00:34.940> few<00:00:35.150> shots<00:00:35.330> him<00:00:35.629> was<00:00:35.809> to<00:00:36.199> land<00:00:36.379> a

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:36.470 
and those a few shots him was to land a

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.430 
and those a few shots him was to land a
couple<00:00:36.590> of<00:00:36.739> shots<00:00:36.980> and<00:00:37.220> I<00:00:37.340> figured<00:00:37.970> that<00:00:38.440> you

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
couple of shots and I figured that you

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.130 
couple of shots and I figured that you
know<00:00:39.559> yeah<00:00:40.550> it's<00:00:40.850> pretty<00:00:41.000> hard<00:00:41.269> but<00:00:41.449> he's<00:00:41.690> not

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
know yeah it's pretty hard but he's not

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.840 
know yeah it's pretty hard but he's not
the<00:00:42.350> same<00:00:42.590> type<00:00:42.860> of<00:00:42.890> hitter<00:00:43.100> I<00:00:43.190> am<00:00:43.430> and<00:00:43.760> he's

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
the same type of hitter I am and he's

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.660 
the same type of hitter I am and he's
not<00:00:44.030> as<00:00:44.149> fast<00:00:44.360> as<00:00:44.480> I<00:00:44.600> am<00:00:44.630> so<00:00:45.170> I<00:00:45.440> believe<00:00:46.219> that<00:00:46.250> I

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
not as fast as I am so I believe that I

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.260 
not as fast as I am so I believe that I
can<00:00:46.850> definitely<00:00:47.500> get<00:00:48.500> the<00:00:48.649> right<00:00:48.800> shots<00:00:49.100> in<00:00:49.309> to

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
can definitely get the right shots in to

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.410 
can definitely get the right shots in to
catch<00:00:50.719> Manny<00:00:51.170> Pacquiao<00:00:51.500> now<00:00:52.100> you<00:00:52.210> knocked<00:00:53.210> out

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
catch Manny Pacquiao now you knocked out

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.330 
catch Manny Pacquiao now you knocked out
Antonio<00:00:53.750> Margarito<00:00:54.020> Manny<00:00:54.739> couldn't<00:00:55.129> do<00:00:55.190> that

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
Antonio Margarito Manny couldn't do that

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.310 
Antonio Margarito Manny couldn't do that
is<00:00:55.550> that<00:00:55.969> an<00:00:56.090> extra<00:00:56.329> motivation<00:00:56.660> and<00:00:56.960> an<00:00:57.020> extra

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
is that an extra motivation and an extra

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.049 
is that an extra motivation and an extra
chip<00:00:57.559> on<00:00:57.739> your<00:00:57.770> shoulder<00:00:57.920> to<00:00:58.309> have<00:00:58.520> coming

than margarita and maybe Manny Pacquiao
my<00:01:08.539> backup<00:01:08.930> might<00:01:09.080> throw<00:01:09.289> a<00:01:09.320> little<00:01:09.590> bit<00:01:09.710> more

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
my backup might throw a little bit more

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.730 
my backup might throw a little bit more
but<00:01:10.490> my<00:01:10.640> punch<00:01:10.880> is<00:01:11.000> a<00:01:11.119> little<00:01:11.360> heavier<00:01:11.740> now

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
but my punch is a little heavier now

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.529 
but my punch is a little heavier now
looking<00:01:13.039> at<00:01:13.100> this<00:01:13.190> fight<00:01:13.430> you<00:01:14.180> said<00:01:14.390> in<00:01:14.479> the

00:01:14.529 --> 00:01:14.539 
looking at this fight you said in the

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:15.820 
looking at this fight you said in the
past<00:01:14.750> that<00:01:14.960> you<00:01:15.140> think<00:01:15.350> Manny<00:01:15.530> is<00:01:15.650> very

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
past that you think Manny is very

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.590 
past that you think Manny is very
hittable<00:01:16.100> what<00:01:16.670> is<00:01:16.790> it<00:01:16.909> that<00:01:17.000> you<00:01:17.119> see<00:01:17.299> in<00:01:17.479> his

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
hittable what is it that you see in his

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.969 
hittable what is it that you see in his
game<00:01:17.780> that<00:01:17.990> makes<00:01:18.200> him<00:01:18.350> extremely<00:01:18.530> hittable

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
game that makes him extremely hittable

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.560 
game that makes him extremely hittable
to<00:01:19.189> you<00:01:21.729> with<00:01:22.729> different<00:01:23.060> shots<00:01:23.240> but<00:01:23.420> that's

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
to you with different shots but that's

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.050 
to you with different shots but that's
only<00:01:23.720> because<00:01:23.930> he's<00:01:24.110> a<00:01:24.260> fighter

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
only because he's a fighter

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.760 
only because he's a fighter
is<00:01:26.060> that<00:01:26.299> because<00:01:26.570> he<00:01:26.689> thinks<00:01:27.049> about<00:01:27.350> defense

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
is that because he thinks about defense

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.950 
is that because he thinks about defense
first<00:01:28.070> he's<00:01:28.369> thinking<00:01:28.820> and<00:01:29.450> how<00:01:29.659> he's<00:01:29.840> gonna

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
first he's thinking and how he's gonna

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.960 
first he's thinking and how he's gonna
land<00:01:30.380> the<00:01:30.590> shots<00:01:30.860> and<00:01:31.159> he'd<00:01:31.400> get<00:01:31.580> the<00:01:31.700> guy<00:01:31.790> with

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
land the shots and he'd get the guy with

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.390 
land the shots and he'd get the guy with
the<00:01:32.000> good<00:01:32.180> shots<00:01:32.420> I<00:01:32.950> mean<00:01:33.950> that's<00:01:34.130> what<00:01:34.280> makes

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
the good shots I mean that's what makes

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.380 
the good shots I mean that's what makes
him<00:01:34.640> who<00:01:34.850> he<00:01:34.909> is<00:01:34.970> so<00:01:35.659> you<00:01:36.259> can't<00:01:36.500> change<00:01:36.680> that

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
him who he is so you can't change that

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.670 
him who he is so you can't change that
stylistically<00:01:38.390> looking<00:01:38.869> at<00:01:39.020> this<00:01:39.140> fight<00:01:39.409> you

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
stylistically looking at this fight you

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.590 
stylistically looking at this fight you
feel<00:01:39.920> that<00:01:40.159> training<00:01:40.549> for<00:01:40.729> this<00:01:40.820> fight<00:01:41.090> would

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
feel that training for this fight would

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.960 
feel that training for this fight would
be<00:01:41.810> more<00:01:41.990> difficult<00:01:42.220> for<00:01:43.220> your<00:01:43.369> training<00:01:43.700> with

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
be more difficult for your training with

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.700 
be more difficult for your training with
Floyd<00:01:44.360> Mayweather<00:01:44.390> or<00:01:45.049> you<00:01:45.140> see<00:01:45.320> this<00:01:45.439> fight<00:01:45.680> a

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
Floyd Mayweather or you see this fight a

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.160 
Floyd Mayweather or you see this fight a
lot<00:01:46.009> tougher<00:01:46.250> than<00:01:46.430> your<00:01:46.670> fight<00:01:46.850> with<00:01:47.000> Ford

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
lot tougher than your fight with Ford

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.039 
lot tougher than your fight with Ford
I<00:01:49.159> don't<00:01:49.610> think<00:01:49.640> it's<00:01:49.850> going<00:01:49.939> to<00:01:50.000> be<00:01:50.119> tougher

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
I don't think it's going to be tougher

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:52.859 
I don't think it's going to be tougher
because<00:01:51.170> it's<00:01:51.439> a<00:01:51.500> different<00:01:51.770> type<00:01:51.890> of<00:01:52.040> fight

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
because it's a different type of fight

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.480 
because it's a different type of fight
