concern of coolant on the passenger
floor<00:00:07.109> mat<00:00:07.350> right<00:00:07.560> there<00:00:07.830> and<00:00:08.309> if<00:00:08.700> you<00:00:08.820> look<00:00:09.030> up

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
floor mat right there and if you look up

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.039 
floor mat right there and if you look up
here<00:00:09.650> under<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:10.769> vent<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.670> floor<00:00:11.940> vent<00:00:12.240> for

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
here under the vent the floor vent for

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.829 
here under the vent the floor vent for
the<00:00:13.110> heater<00:00:13.490> you<00:00:14.490> can<00:00:14.670> actually<00:00:14.849> see<00:00:15.360> coolant

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
the heater you can actually see coolant

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.670 
the heater you can actually see coolant
dripping<00:00:16.410> out<00:00:16.560> of<00:00:16.680> there<00:00:17.359> so<00:00:18.359> most<00:00:19.230> likely<00:00:19.439> a

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
dripping out of there so most likely a

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.310 
dripping out of there so most likely a
heater<00:00:19.949> core<00:00:20.300> going<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.420> pull<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.840> dash<00:00:22.050> out

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
heater core going to pull the dash out

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.130 
heater core going to pull the dash out
pull<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.680> heater<00:00:22.980> core<00:00:23.250> out<00:00:23.810> replace<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:24.990> with

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
pull the heater core out replace it with

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.279 
pull the heater core out replace it with
a<00:00:25.170> new<00:00:25.439> one<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:26.750> let's<00:00:27.750> see<00:00:27.990> how<00:00:28.109> this<00:00:28.230> looks

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
a new one and let's see how this looks

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.200 
a new one and let's see how this looks
once<00:00:28.740> we<00:00:28.890> get<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.160> heater<00:00:29.340> core<00:00:29.640> out<00:00:29.849> of<00:00:30.000> here

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
once we get the heater core out of here

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.260 
once we get the heater core out of here
I've<00:00:30.990> got<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.349> HVAC<00:00:31.830> box<00:00:32.160> out<00:00:32.489> of<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.759> vehicle

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
I've got the HVAC box out of the vehicle

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.740 
I've got the HVAC box out of the vehicle
and<00:00:34.790> it's<00:00:35.790> going<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:35.969> show<00:00:36.239> you<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.540> heater

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
and it's going to show you the heater

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.910 
and it's going to show you the heater
core<00:00:37.079> here<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.710> see<00:00:38.370> where<00:00:38.550> it's<00:00:38.670> been<00:00:38.760> leakin

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
core here and see where it's been leakin

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.040 
core here and see where it's been leakin
along<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.100> edges<00:00:41.460> there<00:00:41.840> just<00:00:42.840> like<00:00:42.989> a

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
along the edges there just like a

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.549 
along the edges there just like a
radiator<00:00:44.480> just<00:00:45.480> start<00:00:45.750> leaking<00:00:45.930> over<00:00:46.320> time

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
radiator just start leaking over time

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:54.080 
radiator just start leaking over time
corrode<00:00:48.320> and<00:00:49.320> start<00:00:49.590> leakin<00:00:50.780> so<00:00:52.879> there's<00:00:53.879> the

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
corrode and start leakin so there's the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.350 
corrode and start leakin so there's the
old<00:00:54.120> heater<00:00:54.510> core<00:00:54.840> that's<00:00:55.199> all<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.590> is

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
old heater core that's all it is

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.680 
old heater core that's all it is
that's<00:00:57.360> all<00:00:57.510> that's<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:59.239> that<00:01:00.239> was<00:01:00.390> sitting

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
that's all that's to it that was sitting

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.779 
that's all that's to it that was sitting
right<00:01:01.530> up<00:01:01.710> in<00:01:01.859> here<00:01:02.070> I've<00:01:02.340> already<00:01:02.460> got<00:01:02.699> the

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
right up in here I've already got the

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.780 
right up in here I've already got the
box<00:01:03.030> all<00:01:03.270> cleaned<00:01:03.600> out<00:01:03.719> but<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.080> can<00:01:04.260> see<00:01:04.439> some

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
box all cleaned out but you can see some

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.300 
box all cleaned out but you can see some
residue<00:01:05.790> from<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.619> coolant<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.799> was<00:01:07.979> puddle

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
residue from the coolant that was puddle

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.660 
residue from the coolant that was puddle
in<00:01:08.400> there<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:08.820> also<00:01:09.510> had<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.310> clean<00:01:11.310> out<00:01:11.460> the

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
in there I also had to clean out the

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.210 
in there I also had to clean out the
vibrator<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:13.290> don't<00:01:13.530> worry<00:01:13.710> that's<00:01:14.010> just

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
vibrator and don't worry that's just

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.609 
vibrator and don't worry that's just
sitting<00:01:14.760> in<00:01:14.850> there<00:01:15.000> enough<00:01:15.299> it's<00:01:16.020> not<00:01:16.170> clamped

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
sitting in there enough it's not clamped

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.640 
sitting in there enough it's not clamped
and<00:01:17.360> I<00:01:18.360> had<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.720> clean<00:01:18.930> all<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.080> out<00:01:19.470> because

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
and I had to clean all this out because

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.789 
and I had to clean all this out because
that<00:01:20.100> coolant<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:21.299> causing<00:01:21.810> dirt<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.470> debris

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
that coolant is causing dirt and debris

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.050 
that coolant is causing dirt and debris
and<00:01:22.830> everything<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.460> stick<00:01:23.759> on<00:01:23.939> the

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
and everything to stick on the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.730 
and everything to stick on the
evaporator<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.930> evaporator<00:01:25.350> was<00:01:25.560> about

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
evaporator and the evaporator was about

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.289 
evaporator and the evaporator was about
50%<00:01:26.100> clogged<00:01:26.759> so<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.630> clean<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.049> up<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:29.299> once

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
50% clogged so I clean that up and once

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.060 
50% clogged so I clean that up and once
that<00:01:30.509> dries<00:01:30.840> out<00:01:31.110> we'll<00:01:31.290> be<00:01:31.320> able<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.680> put<00:01:31.890> that

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
that dries out we'll be able to put that

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.249 
that dries out we'll be able to put that
back<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:33.590> put<00:01:34.590> everything<00:01:34.829> back<00:01:35.159> together

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
back in and put everything back together

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:38.060 
back in and put everything back together
hopefully<00:01:37.259> that'll<00:01:37.470> take<00:01:37.680> care<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.920> our

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
hopefully that'll take care of our

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.160 
hopefully that'll take care of our
problem<00:01:38.689> and<00:01:39.689> we<00:01:39.960> have<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.320> final<00:01:40.650> product<00:01:41.100> so

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
problem and we have the final product so

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.450 
problem and we have the final product so
there<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.290> is<00:01:43.380> all<00:01:43.590> put<00:01:43.770> back<00:01:43.799> together<00:01:44.130> with

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
there it is all put back together with

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.620 
there it is all put back together with
the<00:01:44.549> new<00:01:44.700> heater<00:01:44.909> core<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.390> cleaned

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
the new heater core and a cleaned

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.050 
the new heater core and a cleaned
evaporator<00:01:46.170> still<00:01:46.680> got<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.950> take<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.220> up<00:01:47.310> the

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
evaporator still got to take it up the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.429 
evaporator still got to take it up the
shop<00:01:48.299> up<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.689> street<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.079> have<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.320> a/c

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.429 
shop up the street to have the a/c
charged<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.119> don't<00:01:51.360> have<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.780> tool<00:01:52.140> yet
