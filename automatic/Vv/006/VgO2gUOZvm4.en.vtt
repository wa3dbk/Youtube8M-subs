suppress<00:04:01.729> which<00:04:01.849> is<00:04:01.970> really<00:04:02.209> good<00:04:02.419> because

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:02.479 
suppress which is really good because

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:05.020 
suppress which is really good because
the<00:04:02.870> extra<00:04:03.109> ammo<00:04:03.409> helps<00:04:04.189> out<00:04:04.310> so<00:04:04.549> much<00:04:04.760> you

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
the extra ammo helps out so much you

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.909 
the extra ammo helps out so much you
know<00:04:05.120> you<00:04:05.449> get<00:04:05.810> more<00:04:05.989> ammo<00:04:06.169> in<00:04:06.409> your<00:04:06.530> clip<00:04:06.769> so

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:06.919 
know you get more ammo in your clip so

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:07.990 
know you get more ammo in your clip so
you'd<00:04:07.010> have<00:04:07.040> to<00:04:07.189> worry<00:04:07.310> about<00:04:07.400> getting<00:04:07.729> you

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
you'd have to worry about getting you

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.749 
you'd have to worry about getting you
know<00:04:08.090> scavenger<00:04:08.540> packs<00:04:08.750> that<00:04:08.840> much<00:04:09.139> and<00:04:09.949> the

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:10.759 
know scavenger packs that much and the

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:11.979 
know scavenger packs that much and the
suppressor<00:04:11.180> helps<00:04:11.419> because<00:04:11.509> it<00:04:11.689> can<00:04:11.780> keep<00:04:11.930> you

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
suppressor helps because it can keep you

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:13.780 
suppressor helps because it can keep you
stealthy<00:04:12.530> and<00:04:12.620> ninja<00:04:12.979> off<00:04:13.099> the<00:04:13.280> map<00:04:13.489> so<00:04:13.759> you

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
stealthy and ninja off the map so you

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.699 
stealthy and ninja off the map so you
