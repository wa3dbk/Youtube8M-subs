00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.790
 take medication against a psychosis 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.100
 but therefore suffer from serious physical side effects such as 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.100
 overweight diabetes or heart disease 

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:13.739
 Thousands of patients in mental health care are affected 

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:16.139
 emmen 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.780
 to address the problems, the emir van accor group ended it 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:21.810
 developed a step-by-step plan 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.580
 Patients can thus be seen regularly transforming problems where 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.060
 possible 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.279
 something will always come out of this 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:31.440
 what became eighth 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.480
 this is very specific when someone reports 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.090
 and with a 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.420
 and my case of the first team 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.770
 the other 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.080
 I can do it too 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.640
 Every phase of sources it still takes secretly though you have to watch falls 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.620
 this newspaper is expected for me on twitter 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.670
 kampong can watch watching from 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.750
 what information and what information should have been available 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.650
 the information can still go together 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.400
 the icc 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.210
 diagnostic can view his piece of 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.260
 the fence and all this for each other 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.650
 when someone reports with a 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.280
 I blame them 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.920
 and 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.530
 further explanation of the col we use then 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.420
 and that is how it should be step by step and treatment 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.220
 which I think 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.690
 by the intense about 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.410
 so need to know 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:25.950
 according to the guidelines 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.140
 to have some information 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.140
 is possible in good spirits 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.180
 next year, the step-by-step plan will be introduced everywhere at emir van arkel 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.150
 It is the intention that all treatment teams give you as much training as possible 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.840
 get started in the same way to deal with physical problems in patients 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.190
 appearance 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.190
 ten psychotic disorders are already being cooperated 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.240
 and anyway with us 10 standard intake protocol where 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.020
 in the first phase that clients come to us 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.390
 certain conversations are planned 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.140
 and in it we just so once the research it beats them screening 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.199
 fixed part included 

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:12.769
 smeets come to be with us within the first intake and receive 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.319
 then let's make you home 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.220
 where the follow-up agreements are, it is full of information but found 

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:24.919
 even though the jab is full of animals and that requires asking 

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:28.309
 Before she 

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:32.149
 the shoemaker come to the appointment talk summons circle takes place or if the 

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:35.149
 look at the trend 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.470
 except without food is an active lifestyle and see sion somatic 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:43.019
 prevent problems 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.019
 therefore patients are discussed what they can do themselves against 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:47.859
 physical complaints 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:51.409
 in addition, they can also use fitness to maintain a level of fitness 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:53.179
 to get 

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:55.669
 what we five of the six do drop 

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:57.149
 they've been throwing 

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:58.129
 knee trap 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:59.689
 yourself 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:04.010
 and reports when the road goes if I want that more well 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.559
 Inquire with an ordinary person to encourage people to come back to it themselves 

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:12.069
 m movement very important 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.579
 try to be aware of what living what am i doing with 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:18.909
 with the first move and things like that 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:23.439
 that often suggests a number of things ad and the limits to hold 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:27.389
 no look I get you to adjust 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:29.509
 a next step is ok 

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:32.619
 yes I would like to get in touch with the golan GPs 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.079
 This information can help you identify the most united in the referral letter 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:42.989
 and that they know he is 80 also know if someone is at a specialist or what 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.729
 someone is using medication 

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:47.339
 because now often it appears that you are on the road 

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:50.959
 and the eighth person also came for physical complaints with medication 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:51.609
 used 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:52.819
 usually you see there 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:56.429
 and see what is that pump school vacation very quickly that weight or that 

00:03:56.429 --> 00:03:59.759
 not we now have everything for az that crytek increases then we know that is 

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:04.239
 sad this side we are now going to make norway must have the same reason to volt up 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.269
 can change school or is that a reason to use other things and 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.599
 to encourage people to eat and exercise or 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:13.209
 the Zwolle nurses 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.689
 with a steering wheel and the sea of ​​comme, once on the road you start moving once 

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:19.689
 because we have in to more practical 

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:23.639
 to translate 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:28.010
 where we are aware of the potential risks and that held the case 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:30.960
 I did not look for concrete suits 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.300
 and because we have now opted for a kind of standard 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.979
 is it actually done and that is not his part of 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:40.099
 social workers 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:42.180
 through the issues of the day 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.400
 You sometimes have to find out that this sort of thing is set between doomers 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.949
 It is also important that you receive a signal or that through the 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:53.680
 tour planning 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.680
 so that ever again is summons kriebstein 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.199
 certainly within the 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:02.900
 some people who are long term and treatment 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.879
 that problem was also injured 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:08.509
 also because its a number of other things people play subjects with 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:12.569
 be less aware of this due to poor visibility 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:16.449
 the possible physical problems can play field it passes 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:17.930
 To our 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.120
 less rapidly 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.490
 were the doctor access you can imagine what people m that doctors 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:25.639
 on deck 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:29.150
 people are already being treated by the mental health care I could do it there weekly 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:31.539
 m as a result 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:34.979
 just as the contact with home visits is less, that is what people there are 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:37.719
 less in the picture 

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:39.460
 be fished from it 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.729
 of course it doesn't stop when diesel makes screenings 

00:05:45.059 --> 00:05:48.059
 you can have them you can have information 

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:50.330
 that's nice 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.430
 bird on venus to know but for the clients that especially suffers if it 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.069
 is right about being overweight 

00:05:56.069 --> 00:05:58.460
 of magic in his daily life 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.020
 so i think we like it 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.970
 It is also important to make a step further, not just from gool 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:08.319
 what is the step-by-step plan that your card uses to come to texting and screening 

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:12.759
 what he screens how can your list do something about it and how can you do it 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.210
 keeping an eye on the knowledge of 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.849
 they do have a lot of fans but clients also great what a good idea 

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:25.819
 vacant racing and debate 

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:27.330
 what you can do about it yourself 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:28.560
 at the tips of 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.490
 we have a pass there and come up with something practical 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:36.450
 and we do not go with those with you do not have all the guidelines 

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:37.809
 we try on 

00:06:37.809 --> 00:06:38.719
 bird 

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:42.689
 the project team for yourself just a very practical guidelines you work 

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:44.419
 paris and 

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:47.719
 you have not considered too many steps 

00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:50.879
 anyone can perform 

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:53.879
 try to get started and try 

00:06:55.449 --> 00:06:58.169
 make it aware that it's not just about it 

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:00.300
 back from a psychiatrist 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.459
 muller from the foundation specialists try to get everyone involved
