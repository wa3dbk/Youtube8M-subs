Whats up everybody?? Hello Patax friends! Here we are at Infinity Studios...

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.880
Where we recorded all the Patax tribute to Michael Jackson.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.560
...and I have a good news...

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.320
..and a bad news!

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.540
the bad one is that all the videos are published, what is done is done..

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.640
and I am a bit nostalgic, of being here where everything took place..

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.660
In this exact spot Lidón Patiño danced in some of the tunes..

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.460
In this piano Federico Lechner, Jorge Vera and Dani García recorded some amazing stuff..

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.820
Alain Pérez was right here singing beautiful vocals

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.920
I´m not going to mention all the band members, because I always forget someone...

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.800
The brass section, Mr. Valentín Iturat recorded back there..

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.500
Marcos Collado and Israel Sandoval

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.980
..Alana, and everybody that recorded in this album..

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.700
And here we are, with none of them around anymore...

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.340
And that makes me feel melancholic..

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.460
The good news is.... That we finally have the cd!!!!!

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.040
So you can already get your copy !!

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.880
...In big stores, I guess, that depends on the label, I´m sure it will be around..

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.260
On my website and on Patax Facebook, I will put the links to buy it easily...

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.000
its great!! all this moments I was talking about and many others are recorded on this album..

00:04:19.775 --> 00:04:23.755
We are very proud of the result, and very happy to have our baby with us..

00:04:23.755 --> 00:04:24.975
Squared baby...

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.100
Thanks for being there..

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.860
See you around!!!!
