character<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.730> use<00:00:26.910> especially<00:00:27.390> online<00:00:27.990> I

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
character to use especially online I

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.509 
character to use especially online I
would<00:00:28.590> definitely<00:00:28.920> say<00:00:29.099> he's<00:00:29.250> better<00:00:29.460> off

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
would definitely say he's better off

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.189 
would definitely say he's better off
playing<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.060> online<00:00:30.359> because<00:00:30.510> once<00:00:31.019> you

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
playing and online because once you

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.010 
playing and online because once you
factor<00:00:31.619> in<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.830> lag<00:00:32.070> when<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.090> hop<00:00:33.270> online<00:00:33.480> a

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
pretty hard to perform because they have

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.700 
pretty hard to perform because they have
really<00:00:38.520> tight<00:00:38.879> cancel<00:00:39.540> windows<00:00:39.960> so
