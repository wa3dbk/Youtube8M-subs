00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.710 
stumbled onto a fix and here's what I
did<00:00:28.320> from<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.160> Xbox<00:00:29.640> one<00:00:29.910> home<00:00:30.150> screen<00:00:30.539> I

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
did from the Xbox one home screen I

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.080 
did from the Xbox one home screen I
pulled<00:00:31.199> up<00:00:31.320> my<00:00:31.500> network<00:00:31.920> settings<00:00:32.189> just<00:00:32.940> to

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
pulled up my network settings just to

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.910 
pulled up my network settings just to
make<00:00:33.270> sure<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.020> network<00:00:34.200> status<00:00:34.620> is

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
make sure that the network status is

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.940 
make sure that the network status is
showing<00:00:35.219> n80<00:00:35.700> open<00:00:36.510> that's<00:00:37.020> really<00:00:37.469> important

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
showing n80 open that's really important

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.920 
showing n80 open that's really important

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
my router and my motor once the router

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.569 
my router and my motor once the router
and<00:01:00.059> modem<00:01:00.120> rebooted<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.079> then<00:01:01.680> logged<00:01:01.980> into<00:01:02.309> my

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.929 
and modem rebooted I then logged into my
router<00:01:02.820> this<00:01:03.270> abled<00:01:03.890> UPnP<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.129> saved<00:01:05.760> the

router this abled UPnP and saved the

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.090 
router this abled UPnP and saved the
settings<00:01:06.330> now<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.229> was<00:01:07.350> at<00:01:07.470> this<00:01:07.619> point<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:08.040> I

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
settings now it was at this point that I

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.130 
settings now it was at this point that I
just<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:08.490> happened<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.880> look<00:01:09.090> up<00:01:09.180> at<00:01:09.330> my<00:01:09.450> TV<00:01:09.750> and

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
just so happened to look up at my TV and

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.990 
just so happened to look up at my TV and
I<00:01:10.470> noticed<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:10.920> on<00:01:10.950> my<00:01:11.220> network<00:01:11.460> settings

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
I noticed that on my network settings

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.649 
I noticed that on my network settings
page<00:01:12.270> my<00:01:12.810> n8<00:01:13.200> e<00:01:13.229> type<00:01:13.650> was<00:01:13.860> now<00:01:14.100> set<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.580> open<00:01:14.790> so

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
page my n8 e type was now set to open so

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.630 
page my n8 e type was now set to open so
rather<00:01:16.200> than<00:01:16.470> just<00:01:16.530> stopping<00:01:17.220> there<00:01:17.430> I

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
rather than just stopping there I

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.719 
rather than just stopping there I
decided<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.270> rename<00:01:18.689> all<00:01:18.900> UPnP<00:01:19.740> save<00:01:20.520> the

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.120 
decided to rename all UPnP save the
settings<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.270> then<00:01:21.810> reset<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.320> router<00:01:22.650> while

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
settings and then reset the router while

logged in to the router

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.480 
logged in to the router
now<00:01:25.110> at<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:25.380> point<00:01:25.650> all<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:25.890> did<00:01:26.130> was<00:01:26.280> run<00:01:26.460> a

quick multiplayer connection check and
sure<00:01:29.070> enough<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.490> problem<00:01:29.670> had<00:01:29.970> been

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
sure enough the problem had been

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.120
