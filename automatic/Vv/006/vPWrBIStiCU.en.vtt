 self-made game 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.950
 the pdp fell in agreement max is a trap to steal the fighting system

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.750
 installed in a couch and that's quite natural recently it does not have 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.620
 want that's why we did not just transpose 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.000
 the contours of the future yes we have completely adapted for more 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.790
 comfort at the controller these actions do not want that we added actions 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.950
 contextual that one triggers directly with a balzac button or and 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.020

 in a slightly different way star relying on a goal that is not 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.830
 easy for them always in the fields as varied as the fight to 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.660
 the sword or chemistry and chapel saint-anne and then target 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.440

 forest must be executed precisions higher on foot but this 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.969
 new option changes the life expectancy operating in the fighting that is 

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:29.969
 unglued 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:53.319
