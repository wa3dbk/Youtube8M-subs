00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.460 

okay<00:00:01.410> so<00:00:02.310> this<00:00:02.850> is<00:00:03.090> a<00:00:03.120> new<00:00:03.540> snapshot<00:00:03.929> glitch<00:00:04.910> as

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:06.470 
okay so this is a new snapshot glitch as

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.120 
okay so this is a new snapshot glitch as
you<00:00:07.470> can<00:00:07.560> see<00:00:07.770> it's<00:00:08.630> pretty<00:00:09.800> game-breaking<00:00:10.800> I

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
you can see it's pretty game-breaking I

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.270 
you can see it's pretty game-breaking I
guess<00:00:11.309> is<00:00:11.490> you<00:00:11.820> can<00:00:12.000> call<00:00:12.179> it<00:00:12.889> what<00:00:13.889> actually

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
guess is you can call it what actually

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.470 
guess is you can call it what actually
happened<00:00:14.670> is<00:00:14.759> I<00:00:14.910> went<00:00:15.089> into<00:00:15.179> my<00:00:15.360> video

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
happened is I went into my video

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.560 
happened is I went into my video
settings<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.320> change<00:00:16.619> my<00:00:17.150> my<00:00:18.150> render

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
settings and change my my render

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.170 
settings and change my my render
distance<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:19.340> it<00:00:20.340> just<00:00:20.550> messed<00:00:20.760> it<00:00:20.939> all<00:00:21.119> up

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
distance and it just messed it all up

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.170 
distance and it just messed it all up
let's<00:00:22.170> see<00:00:22.350> if<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:22.650> will<00:00:22.710> do<00:00:22.859> it<00:00:22.949> again

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
let's see if it will do it again

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.160 
let's see if it will do it again
probably<00:00:24.180> won't<00:00:24.330> be<00:00:24.420> able<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.630> recreate<00:00:24.990> it

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
probably won't be able to recreate it

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.759 
probably won't be able to recreate it
yep<00:00:25.439> ok<00:00:26.039> just<00:00:26.400> like<00:00:26.580> that<00:00:30.380> don't<00:00:31.380> really<00:00:31.560> know

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
yep ok just like that don't really know

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.760 
yep ok just like that don't really know
how<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:31.980> fix<00:00:32.160> this<00:00:32.430> I<00:00:32.719> just<00:00:33.719> figured<00:00:34.079> out<00:00:34.290> if

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
how to fix this I just figured out if

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.260 
how to fix this I just figured out if
any<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.489> guys<00:00:35.670> know<00:00:35.750> what<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.899> do<00:00:37.050> about<00:00:37.170> it

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
any of you guys know what to do about it

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.619 
any of you guys know what to do about it
you<00:00:39.270> tell<00:00:39.510> me<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:39.890> mean<00:00:40.890> if<00:00:41.730> that's<00:00:42.210> asking<00:00:42.570> too

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
you tell me I mean if that's asking too

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.950 
you tell me I mean if that's asking too
much<00:00:43.789> but<00:00:44.789> yeah<00:00:44.940> it's<00:00:45.180> pretty<00:00:45.660> annoying

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
much but yeah it's pretty annoying

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.150 
much but yeah it's pretty annoying
because<00:00:46.200> I<00:00:46.350> have<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.530> keep<00:00:46.710> my<00:00:46.770> render

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
because I have to keep my render

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.529 
because I have to keep my render
distance<00:00:47.960> pretty<00:00:48.960> low<00:00:50.239> so<00:00:51.239> yeah<00:00:51.329> it's<00:00:51.420> at

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
distance pretty low so yeah it's at

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.540 
distance pretty low so yeah it's at
eight<00:00:51.750> now<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.350> let's<00:00:52.530> move<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.949> up<00:00:53.070> one<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.460> was

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
eight now so let's move it up one it was

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:01.420 
eight now so let's move it up one it was
at<00:00:53.640> seven<00:00:53.820> before<00:00:54.680> it's<00:00:55.680> nein<00:00:55.920> nein<00:00:59.359> and<00:01:00.359> now

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
at seven before it's nein nein and now

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.550 
at seven before it's nein nein and now
as<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.969> can<00:01:03.090> see

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.499 

just<00:01:08.220> morphing<00:01:08.759> everything<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.270> don't<00:01:09.420> even

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
just morphing everything I don't even

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:10.609 
just morphing everything I don't even
know<00:01:09.720> where<00:01:09.840> it's<00:01:09.990> getting<00:01:10.200> half<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.530> these

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
know where it's getting half of these

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.429 
know where it's getting half of these
pictures<00:01:11.149> and<00:01:12.149> I'll<00:01:12.720> move<00:01:12.899> it<00:01:13.020> back<00:01:13.229> down<00:01:15.439> 8c

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
pictures and I'll move it back down 8c

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.779 
pictures and I'll move it back down 8c
does<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.710> do<00:01:16.799> anything<00:01:16.829> do<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.369> with<00:01:17.490> anything

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:17.789 
does it do anything do it with anything

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:21.649 
does it do anything do it with anything
else<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.240> does<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:20.210> apparently<00:01:21.210> i<00:01:21.299> need<00:01:21.509> to

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
else it does so apparently i need to

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:34.340 
else it does so apparently i need to
keep<00:01:21.899> it<00:01:22.079> at<00:01:25.369> six<00:01:26.369> wait<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.539> see<00:01:27.600> seven<00:01:33.350> okay

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
keep it at six wait and see seven okay

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.230 
keep it at six wait and see seven okay
so<00:01:34.409> seven<00:01:35.039> seems<00:01:35.280> fine<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:35.579> if<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:35.970> guys<00:01:36.090> are

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
so seven seems fine so if you guys are

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.240 
so seven seems fine so if you guys are
having<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.570> same<00:01:36.720> problem<00:01:36.780> now<00:01:37.350> I'd<00:01:37.530> try<00:01:37.829> your

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
having the same problem now I'd try your

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.149 
having the same problem now I'd try your
render<00:01:38.549> distance<00:01:38.759> at<00:01:39.210> seven<00:01:39.539> chunks<00:01:39.959> I'll<00:01:40.950> try

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
render distance at seven chunks I'll try

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.340 
render distance at seven chunks I'll try
this<00:01:41.250> one<00:01:41.759> more<00:01:41.850> time<00:01:41.970> let's<00:01:42.479> just<00:01:42.600> go<00:01:42.929> all<00:01:43.170> the

Spruce door birch jungle acacia and dark
wood<00:02:32.350> okay<00:02:33.250> so<00:02:33.670> now<00:02:34.030> these<00:02:34.690> are<00:02:34.990> perfectly

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
wood okay so now these are perfectly

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
wood okay so now these are perfectly
fine<00:02:35.590> they<00:02:35.800> all<00:02:35.920> work<00:02:36.130> normal<00:02:36.670> as<00:02:37.630> you<00:02:37.840> can<00:02:37.990> see

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
fine they all work normal as you can see

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.040 
fine they all work normal as you can see
but<00:02:39.400> as<00:02:39.610> soon<00:02:39.820> as<00:02:40.000> we<00:02:40.180> switch<00:02:40.510> let's<00:02:40.840> go<00:02:40.989> to

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
but as soon as we switch let's go to

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:48.210 
but as soon as we switch let's go to
game<00:02:41.800> mode<00:02:43.739> yeah<00:02:45.030> as<00:02:46.030> soon<00:02:46.390> as<00:02:46.420> you<00:02:46.920> mine<00:02:47.920> them

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
game mode yeah as soon as you mine them

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.860 
game mode yeah as soon as you mine them
which<00:02:48.970> you'd<00:02:49.150> have<00:02:49.300> to<00:02:49.390> do<00:02:49.510> in<00:02:49.600> regular

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
which you'd have to do in regular

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.160 
which you'd have to do in regular
survival<00:02:50.380> they<00:02:51.220> all<00:02:51.489> revert<00:02:51.970> to<00:02:52.239> regular

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170
