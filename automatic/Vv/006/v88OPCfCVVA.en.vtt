okay here it is

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.299 
okay here it is
all<00:00:04.170> glassed-in<00:00:04.680> I<00:00:06.649> sealed<00:00:07.649> this<00:00:07.859> part<00:00:08.160> right

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
all glassed-in I sealed this part right

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.650 
all glassed-in I sealed this part right
here<00:00:09.139> from<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.349> cap<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.580> hall<00:00:11.759> is<00:00:12.389> all

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
here from the cap to the hall is all

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.560 
here from the cap to the hall is all
sealed<00:00:12.929> so<00:00:13.139> that's<00:00:13.320> all<00:00:13.469> watertight<00:00:14.330> and<00:00:15.330> I

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
sealed so that's all watertight and I

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.189 
sealed so that's all watertight and I
beat<00:00:15.780> it<00:00:15.809> in<00:00:16.049> silicone<00:00:16.560> on<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:16.920> side<00:00:18.080> and<00:00:19.080> I

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
beat it in silicone on the side and I

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.630 
beat it in silicone on the side and I
got<00:00:19.380> this<00:00:19.500> lumen<00:00:19.920> cap<00:00:20.210> right<00:00:21.210> here<00:00:22.160> that<00:00:23.160> I

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
got this lumen cap right here that I

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
got this lumen cap right here that I
will<00:00:24.470> put<00:00:25.470> down<00:00:25.500> seal<00:00:26.340> here<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.849> hint<00:00:27.060> so

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
will put down seal here to the hint so

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.179 
will put down seal here to the hint so
the<00:00:27.750> motor<00:00:27.960> will<00:00:28.080> sit<00:00:28.380> nice<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:28.800> tight<00:00:28.980> on

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
the motor will sit nice and tight on

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.840 
the motor will sit nice and tight on
there<00:00:29.550> have<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.939> lot<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.269> support<00:00:34.520> over<00:00:35.520> here<00:00:35.730> on

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
there have a lot of support over here on

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.979 
there have a lot of support over here on
the<00:00:35.940> sides<00:00:37.010> the<00:00:38.010> cap<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.690> glass<00:00:39.690> back

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
the sides the cap is a glass back

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.400 
the sides the cap is a glass back
together<00:00:42.230> it<00:00:43.230> is<00:00:43.379> ugly<00:00:43.680> but<00:00:44.579> that's<00:00:44.910> okay<00:00:45.410> the

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
together it is ugly but that's okay the

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.750 
together it is ugly but that's okay the
fish<00:00:46.620> can't<00:00:46.950> tell<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.280> difference

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
fish can't tell the difference

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.360 
fish can't tell the difference
so<00:00:48.750> that's<00:00:48.930> alright<00:00:50.149> the<00:00:51.149> other<00:00:51.210> side<00:00:52.370> same

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
so that's alright the other side same

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.990 
so that's alright the other side same
way<00:00:53.550> all<00:00:54.030> that's<00:00:54.420> blast<00:00:54.780> back<00:00:55.020> in<00:00:55.820> just<00:00:56.820> wait

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
way all that's blast back in just wait

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.680 
way all that's blast back in just wait
for<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.420> dry<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:59.120> then<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.180> can<00:01:00.359> sand<00:01:00.600> it

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
for it to dry and then I can sand it

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.830 
for it to dry and then I can sand it
down<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:00.899> be<00:01:01.109> nice<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.320> smooth<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.840> that's

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
down and be nice and smooth and that's

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.359 
down and be nice and smooth and that's
pretty<00:01:04.320> much<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.689> complete<00:01:07.100> other<00:01:08.100> than

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
pretty much it it is complete other than

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.670 
pretty much it it is complete other than
putting<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.729> motor<00:01:08.880> back<00:01:09.150> on<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.840> finishing

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
putting the motor back on and finishing

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.679 
putting the motor back on and finishing
it<00:01:10.770> up<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.280> know<00:01:11.340> putting<00:01:12.210> all<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.360> hardware

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
it up you know putting all the hardware

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:19.179 
it up you know putting all the hardware
back<00:01:12.869> together<00:01:13.729> I<00:01:15.110> did<00:01:16.110> use<00:01:17.270> this<00:01:18.270> here

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
back together I did use this here

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:23.149 
back together I did use this here
fiberglass<00:01:20.189> cloth<00:01:21.290> instead<00:01:22.290> of<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.650> mat<00:01:22.890> on

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
fiberglass cloth instead of the mat on

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.520 
fiberglass cloth instead of the mat on
this<00:01:23.729> because<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.240> little<00:01:24.540> stronger<00:01:24.900> and

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
this because it is a little stronger and

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.289 
this because it is a little stronger and
it's<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.890> little<00:01:26.100> neater<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.670> easier<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.210> work

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
it's a little neater and easier to work

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.859 
it's a little neater and easier to work
with<00:01:27.450> in<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.869> mat<00:01:30.049> so<00:01:31.049> that's<00:01:31.680> pretty<00:01:32.009> much<00:01:32.100> it

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
with in the mat so that's pretty much it

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.039 
with in the mat so that's pretty much it
the<00:01:33.869> next<00:01:34.140> shot<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.530> I'll<00:01:34.680> have<00:01:34.890> for<00:01:34.920> you

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
the next shot that I'll have for you

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.569 
the next shot that I'll have for you
should<00:01:37.049> be<00:01:37.229> with<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.530> motor<00:01:37.680> back<00:01:37.920> on<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.460> the

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
should be with the motor back on and the

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.090 
should be with the motor back on and the
cover<00:01:39.270> back<00:01:39.509> on<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:39.780> hopefully<00:01:40.740> it'll<00:01:41.009> be

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
cover back on and hopefully it'll be

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.030 
cover back on and hopefully it'll be
floating<00:01:41.430> in<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.579> water<00:01:42.710> I'll<00:01:43.710> let<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:43.979> know

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
floating in the water I'll let you know

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.880 
floating in the water I'll let you know
how<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.310> goes<00:01:45.200> one<00:01:46.200> more<00:01:46.380> thing<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.680> want<00:01:46.860> to

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
how that goes one more thing I want to

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.569 
how that goes one more thing I want to
let<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.100> know<00:01:47.630> is<00:01:48.630> here<00:01:49.460> on<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.820> drain<00:01:51.119> hole

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
let you know is here on the drain hole

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.859 
let you know is here on the drain hole
what<00:01:53.579> I'm<00:01:53.670> going<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.880> do<00:01:54.000> just<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.420> keep<00:01:54.630> that

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
what I'm going to do just to keep that

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.719 
what I'm going to do just to keep that
from<00:01:55.049> rotting<00:01:55.290> out<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:55.799> I'm<00:01:56.369> going<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.549> drill

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
from rotting out is I'm going to drill

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.959 
from rotting out is I'm going to drill
this<00:01:56.850> out<00:01:57.060> bigger<00:01:57.600> size<00:01:58.729> then<00:01:59.729> I'm<00:01:59.820> going<00:01:59.939> to

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
this out bigger size then I'm going to

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.910 
this out bigger size then I'm going to
fill<00:02:00.119> this<00:02:00.149> hole<00:02:00.450> full<00:02:00.719> of<00:02:00.750> fiberglass<00:02:01.320> resin

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
fill this hole full of fiberglass resin

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.700 
fill this hole full of fiberglass resin
and<00:02:02.100> let<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.790> harden<00:02:03.229> then<00:02:04.229> we'll<00:02:04.380> come<00:02:04.560> back

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
and let that harden then we'll come back

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.310 
and let that harden then we'll come back
with<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.920> smaller<00:02:05.340> bit<00:02:05.780> and<00:02:06.780> I'm<00:02:07.140> going<00:02:07.229> to

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
with a smaller bit and I'm going to

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.070 
with a smaller bit and I'm going to
drill<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.619> out<00:02:07.710> so<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.849> inner<00:02:09.030> core<00:02:09.450> of<00:02:09.750> this

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
drill it out so the inner core of this

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.370 
drill it out so the inner core of this
is<00:02:10.349> all<00:02:10.530> going<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:10.800> be<00:02:11.510> fiberglass<00:02:12.510> resin

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
is all going to be fiberglass resin

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.980 
is all going to be fiberglass resin
it'll<00:02:13.650> be<00:02:13.740> waterproof<00:02:14.370> I<00:02:14.790> won't<00:02:15.780> have<00:02:15.900> to

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
it'll be waterproof I won't have to

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.360 
it'll be waterproof I won't have to
worry<00:02:16.170> about<00:02:16.260> putting<00:02:16.650> a<00:02:16.680> sleeve<00:02:16.950> in<00:02:17.160> there

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
worry about putting a sleeve in there

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.200 
worry about putting a sleeve in there
and<00:02:17.610> silicone<00:02:18.150> in<00:02:18.330> a<00:02:18.620> drain<00:02:19.730> in<00:02:20.730> there<00:02:21.060> because

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
and silicone in a drain in there because

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.760 
and silicone in a drain in there because
that'll<00:02:22.020> be<00:02:22.050> a<00:02:22.110> solid<00:02:22.560> fiberglass<00:02:23.190> sleeve

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
that'll be a solid fiberglass sleeve

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.480 
that'll be a solid fiberglass sleeve
running<00:02:26.360> all<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.630> way<00:02:27.660> through<00:02:28.310> so<00:02:29.310> I<00:02:29.340> won't

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
running all the way through so I won't

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.700 
running all the way through so I won't
have<00:02:29.610> to<00:02:29.700> worry<00:02:29.850> about<00:02:30.030> that<00:02:30.210> no<00:02:30.360> more

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
have to worry about that no more

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.780 
have to worry about that no more
other<00:02:31.710> than<00:02:31.830> that<00:02:31.920> when<00:02:32.280> I<00:02:32.310> get<00:02:32.400> it<00:02:32.610> put<00:02:32.760> back

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
other than that when I get it put back

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.820 
other than that when I get it put back
together<00:02:33.060> I'll<00:02:33.660> give<00:02:34.020> you<00:02:34.110> a<00:02:34.140> shot<00:02:34.380> so<00:02:34.710> you<00:02:34.740> can

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
together I'll give you a shot so you can

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.680 
together I'll give you a shot so you can
see<00:02:35.040> how<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.280> completed<00:02:36.030> boat<00:02:36.210> turned<00:02:36.510> out

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
see how the completed boat turned out

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.320 
see how the completed boat turned out
and<00:02:37.280> we'll<00:02:38.280> see<00:02:38.460> if<00:02:38.550> it<00:02:38.640> floats<00:02:38.850> and<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.180> motor

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
and we'll see if it floats and the motor

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.680 
and we'll see if it floats and the motor
stays<00:02:39.570> on<00:02:40.280> that's<00:02:41.280> it<00:02:41.460> for<00:02:41.610> now<00:02:41.700> here's<00:02:42.570> a

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
stays on that's it for now here's a

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.160 
stays on that's it for now here's a
quick<00:02:42.960> update<00:02:43.140> on<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:43.560> drain<00:02:44.450> I<00:02:45.450> boarded<00:02:46.140> my

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
quick update on the drain I boarded my

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.230 
quick update on the drain I boarded my
hole<00:02:46.410> out<00:02:46.680> through<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.100> transom<00:02:47.640> with<00:02:48.210> a

come back and I'm going to drill it out
with<00:03:17.340> a<00:03:17.370> one-inch<00:03:17.910> hole<00:03:18.390> drill<00:03:19.340> that<00:03:20.340> will

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
with a one-inch hole drill that will

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.160 
with a one-inch hole drill that will
give<00:03:20.640> me<00:03:20.730> a<00:03:20.790> quarter<00:03:21.150> inch<00:03:22.190> resin<00:03:23.190> core<00:03:24.170> so

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
give me a quarter inch resin core so

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.780 
give me a quarter inch resin core so
it'll<00:03:25.650> be<00:03:25.740> water<00:03:25.950> proof<00:03:26.040> I<00:03:26.430> won't<00:03:26.610> have<00:03:26.700> to

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
it'll be water proof I won't have to

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.040 
it'll be water proof I won't have to
worry<00:03:26.940> about<00:03:27.060> it<00:03:27.240> leak<00:03:27.390> and<00:03:27.570> will<00:03:27.750> not<00:03:27.840> worry

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
about putting the metal sleeve in there

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.990 
about putting the metal sleeve in there
or<00:03:30.330> anything<00:03:30.570> of<00:03:30.810> that<00:03:30.840> nature<00:03:31.670> I'll<00:03:32.670> give<00:03:32.880> you

a<00:03:36.000> little<00:03:36.270> problem<00:03:36.540> with<00:03:36.570> fiberglass<00:03:36.930> resin<00:03:37.530> I

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
a little problem with fiberglass resin I

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.390 
a little problem with fiberglass resin I
guess<00:03:38.700> there's<00:03:38.940> too<00:03:39.120> much<00:03:39.270> of<00:03:39.330> it<00:03:39.540> there<00:03:40.160> so<00:03:41.160> it

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
guess there's too much of it there so it

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.510 
guess there's too much of it there so it
uh<00:03:41.430> it<00:03:42.090> cracked<00:03:42.390> on<00:03:42.600> me<00:03:42.980> but<00:03:43.980> it<00:03:44.070> was<00:03:44.190> enough<00:03:44.490> to

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
uh it cracked on me but it was enough to

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.010 
uh it cracked on me but it was enough to
seal<00:03:44.820> around<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.180> sides<00:03:45.450> that<00:03:45.630> drilled<00:03:45.930> it

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
seal around the sides that drilled it

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.320 
seal around the sides that drilled it
back<00:03:46.200> out<00:03:46.610> with<00:03:47.610> a<00:03:47.640> 1<00:03:47.940> and<00:03:48.650> 1/16<00:03:49.650> inch<00:03:49.860> drill

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
back out with a 1 and 1/16 inch drill

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.050 
back out with a 1 and 1/16 inch drill
and<00:03:51.330> then<00:03:51.720> I<00:03:51.840> just<00:03:52.020> put<00:03:52.470> this<00:03:52.620> piece<00:03:52.890> of<00:03:53.130> 3/4

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
and then I just put this piece of 3/4

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.960 
and then I just put this piece of 3/4
inch<00:03:54.209> PVC<00:03:54.450> pipe<00:03:55.080> in<00:03:55.260> the<00:03:55.350> hole<00:03:55.380> and<00:03:55.860> that<00:03:55.970> fits

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
inch PVC pipe in the hole and that fits

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.380 
inch PVC pipe in the hole and that fits
really<00:03:57.300> tight<00:03:58.310> it's<00:03:59.310> solid<00:03:59.790> that's<00:04:00.000> not<00:04:00.209> going

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
really tight it's solid that's not going

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:06.530 
really tight it's solid that's not going
to<00:04:00.480> leak<00:04:01.190> so<00:04:02.190> the<00:04:03.150> drain<00:04:03.390> hole<00:04:03.630> uh<00:04:05.270> is<00:04:06.270> pretty

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
to leak so the drain hole uh is pretty

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.920 
to leak so the drain hole uh is pretty
much<00:04:06.660> taken<00:04:06.959> care<00:04:06.990> of<00:04:07.260> ya<00:04:08.690> ain't<00:04:09.690> got<00:04:09.780> to<00:04:09.870> worry

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
much taken care of ya ain't got to worry

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:15.789 
much taken care of ya ain't got to worry
about<00:04:10.050> that<00:04:10.320> no<00:04:10.470> more

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:17.680 

there<00:04:16.799> it<00:04:16.889> is

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
there it is

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.890 
there it is
it's<00:04:18.690> floating<00:04:18.989> it's<00:04:19.859> running<00:04:20.720> I'm<00:04:21.720> going<00:04:21.840> to

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
it's floating it's running I'm going to

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.810 
it's floating it's running I'm going to
take<00:04:22.079> it<00:04:22.199> out<00:04:22.320> and<00:04:22.470> put<00:04:23.250> it<00:04:23.280> through<00:04:23.460> the<00:04:23.520> test

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
take it out and put it through the test

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.340 
take it out and put it through the test
so<00:04:24.180> I<00:04:24.210> guess<00:04:24.479> if<00:04:24.630> you're<00:04:24.720> watching<00:04:24.930> this<00:04:25.199> video

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
so I guess if you're watching this video

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.260 
so I guess if you're watching this video
everything<00:04:26.010> went<00:04:26.310> fine<00:04:26.370> because<00:04:26.729> I'm<00:04:26.880> posting

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
everything went fine because I'm posting

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.070 
everything went fine because I'm posting
