thoughts on the iphone 5 and it does

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.959 
thoughts on the iphone 5 and it does
look<00:00:49.860> like<00:00:50.010> it's<00:00:50.190> going<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.399> be<00:00:50.460> talked<00:00:50.700> about

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
look like it's going to be talked about

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.630 
look like it's going to be talked about
when<00:00:51.420> apple<00:00:51.719> holds<00:00:51.989> their<00:00:52.140> annual<00:00:52.649> iOS<00:00:53.399> or

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
when apple holds their annual iOS or

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.360 
when apple holds their annual iOS or
rather<00:00:54.059> ipod<00:00:54.780> events<00:00:55.320> they<00:00:55.739> go<00:00:55.890> over<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.219> new

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
rather ipod events they go over the new

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.790 
rather ipod events they go over the new
the<00:00:56.760> new<00:00:56.879> touch<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.480> new<00:00:57.629> nano<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.530> the

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
the new touch the new nano and the

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.590 
the new touch the new nano and the
shuffle<00:00:59.250> probably<00:00:59.670> won't<00:00:59.820> touch<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.180> classic

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
shuffle probably won't touch the classic

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.130 
shuffle probably won't touch the classic
again<00:01:00.899> but<00:01:01.140> we'll<00:01:01.260> see<00:01:02.030> and<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:03.660> early

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
again but we'll see and that is in early

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.780 
again but we'll see and that is in early
September<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:04.979> they'll<00:01:05.280> probably<00:01:05.519> make<00:01:05.729> a

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
September so they'll probably make a

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.460 
September so they'll probably make a
bigger<00:01:06.060> event<00:01:06.420> out<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.780> more<00:01:06.930> people<00:01:07.290> will

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
bigger event out of it more people will

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.929 
bigger event out of it more people will
go<00:01:07.590> more<00:01:07.860> money<00:01:08.070> will<00:01:08.280> be<00:01:08.430> made<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.850> they'll

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
go more money will be made and they'll

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.060 
go more money will be made and they'll
be<00:01:09.030> talking<00:01:09.180> about<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:10.080> iphone<00:01:10.439> so<00:01:10.710> we'll<00:01:10.830> see

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
be talking about the iphone so we'll see

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.380 
be talking about the iphone so we'll see
what<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.369> iphone<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.700> going<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.030> get<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.299> will

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
what the iphone is going to get it will

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.330 
what the iphone is going to get it will
probably<00:01:12.570> be<00:01:12.720> very<00:01:12.840> similar<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.740> what<00:01:14.070> the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
probably be very similar to what the

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.429 
probably be very similar to what the
ipod<00:01:14.640> touch<00:01:14.909> 5<00:01:15.210> will<00:01:15.780> get<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.140> that's<00:01:16.229> good

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
ipod touch 5 will get and that's good

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.780 
ipod touch 5 will get and that's good
that's<00:01:16.560> going<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.740> make<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.009> ipod<00:01:17.280> touch<00:01:17.520> 5

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
that's going to make the ipod touch 5

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.070 
that's going to make the ipod touch 5
rumors<00:01:18.150> really<00:01:18.420> interesting<00:01:18.930> because

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
rumors really interesting because

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.980 
rumors really interesting because
usually<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:20.070> ipod<00:01:20.430> touch<00:01:20.700> is<00:01:20.939> just<00:01:20.970> six<00:01:21.720> or<00:01:21.840> so

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
usually the ipod touch is just six or so

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.450 
usually the ipod touch is just six or so
months<00:01:22.020> behind<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.619> iphone<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.130> since<00:01:23.310> the

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
months behind the iphone and since the

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.770 
months behind the iphone and since the
iphone<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:23.790> going<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.090> be<00:01:24.180> six<00:01:24.360> months<00:01:24.420> late

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
it's kind of going to be a surprise on

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.179 
it's kind of going to be a surprise on
both<00:01:26.880> frontiers<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.570> see<00:01:27.720> what<00:01:27.869> we<00:01:27.960> get<00:01:28.189> so

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
both frontiers to see what we get so

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.760
