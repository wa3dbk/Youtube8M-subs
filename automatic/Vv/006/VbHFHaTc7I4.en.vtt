00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.570
 dress 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.550
 I did research and found 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.540
 What are the main problems exist in 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.760
 women wardrobe 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.530
 of days nothing to wear and nowhere 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.860
 accordingly hang 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:21.250
 often it seems to many that the wardrobe is nothing 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:24.610
 not talking about them only on faceless 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.710
 interesting gray tasteless lot 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.660
 wardrobe things black beige gray 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.700
 ghana just don't understand what colors go 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.770
 and cocoa and how can they be with each other 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.290
 combine as textures can be with each other 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.970
 combine drawings and so on all things in 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.710
 wardrobe similar to each other inside 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.140
 Minute matching feeling new things 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.520
 until the bottom tag I 'm cutting eat and then she 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.329
 in general, it is exactly the same as everyone 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.370
 the rest of that hang in the closet 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.530
 Often the things in the wardrobe among themselves are not 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.149
 combined it turns out every time on 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.070
 emotions are bought by blouse then 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.890
 blouses for blouses like money 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.719
 spending a lot wardrobe not happy 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.670
 then it is kind of ineffective and every 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.949
 the day is the same problem and what is Sedna 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.199

 reflection in the mirror is not on not happy and 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.320
 suddenly became a card expelled twins and 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.789
 it is not clear how things to combine with each other 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.159
 You can not compose 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:15.580
 in sets I will give if clothes and they 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.470
 way finished and harmoniously 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.240
 incomprehensible every time the onset of winter 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.160
 it's a disaster because it is not clear how 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.080
 pick a hat and how to combine 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.790
 their outerwear so that not the top 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.160
 there must be hope 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.370
 progressively interesting cute but in 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.820
 same time it was warm 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.260

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.630
 what's what and just in case not groups 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.820
 anything that does not look silly does not 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.040
 working with multilayer yes and so on 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.950
 accordingly what we will do 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.840
 to trainings 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.320
 there is no such thing yes of course there are people who 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.320
 born 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.410

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.720
 unreachable 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.760

 We will select clothing options for 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.230

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.430
 take at least 2 hours 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.560

 we will disassemble your wardrobe 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.720
 some things can't and let's 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.150
 some kind of combine with each other 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.130
 make sets inside your already 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.150
 existing wardrobe and learn 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.890

 act stores what to choose how 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.269
 choose what to combine it is clear that 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.610
 The ultimate goal of course not clothes and to 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.140
 your reflection in the mirror pleased you 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.970
 so she extinguished you happiness and 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.209
 pleasures to any men affair 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.400
 you compliments the children to consider their 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.870
 mother is the most beautiful colleagues 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.879
 Respectively on work so that 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.840
 did you friend element to you 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:01.950
 become a true expert in style and fashion 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.599
 The peculiarity of this training is that 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.439
 will it pass at the same time big 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.599
 number of people 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:08.549
 accordingly, this is an additional 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:11.340
 stimulating factor because a lot 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.590
 people united by one idea you will 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.579
 do your homework 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.320
 lay them out see how they perform 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:17.789
 homework other members to take 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.579
 they have some ideas we'll all be 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:21.810
 discuss and comment with you 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:24.100
 accordingly it is very stimulating and 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.900
 the result will always be better for you 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.000
 understandably you can take a bunch 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.530
 books reread pass a bunch of trainings and 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.600
 so on it is always very difficult to do 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.880
 on your own because often books 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.740
 contradict each other in my 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.660
 basis up at the heart of it all lies 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.720
 a large number of practical experience 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.970
 more than two hundred thirty customers 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.460
 endless training passed books so 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.800
 further the main thing in this is to have a base in everything 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:51.100
 we need to further filter 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.930
 information to work with the base and on with 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.630
 using her center that fits what 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.400
 no that so they so and so on 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.400
 accordingly, we will be all this 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.259
 study 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.210
 if you are interested to take part in 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:04.340
