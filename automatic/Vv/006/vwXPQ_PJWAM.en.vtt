actually offer you guys some insight so

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.469 
actually offer you guys some insight so
what<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.130> did<00:01:17.220> was<00:01:17.460> pretty<00:01:17.670> simple<00:01:18.060> all<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.270> did

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
what I did was pretty simple all I did

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.149 
what I did was pretty simple all I did
was<00:01:18.630> search<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.020> VIN<00:01:19.200> number<00:01:19.470> on<00:01:19.500> Google<00:01:20.009> but

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
was search the VIN number on Google but

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.590 
was search the VIN number on Google but
that<00:01:20.310> actually<00:01:20.640> yielded<00:01:20.939> some<00:01:21.150> pretty<00:01:21.330> good

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
that actually yielded some pretty good

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.300 
that actually yielded some pretty good
results<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.350> when<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.590> did<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:22.920> one<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.220> the

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
results and when I did that one of the

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.310 
results and when I did that one of the
top<00:01:23.549> results<00:01:24.030> was<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:24.630> page<00:01:24.900> right<00:01:25.290> here

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
top results was this page right here

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.170 
top results was this page right here
what<00:01:26.100> you're<00:01:26.250> looking<00:01:26.580> at<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:26.880> VIN

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
what you're looking at is VIN

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.330 
what you're looking at is VIN
history.com<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.710> VIN<00:01:28.829> number<00:01:29.040> on<00:01:29.070> screen

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
history.com and the VIN number on screen

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.640 
history.com and the VIN number on screen
is<00:01:29.670> actually<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.150> exact<00:01:30.509> car<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.229> being

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
is actually the exact car that is being

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.499 
is actually the exact car that is being
sold<00:01:31.799> in<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.009> auction<00:01:32.400> because<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:33.030> person

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
sold in the auction because the person

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.940 
sold in the auction because the person
selling<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.810> posted<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.200> VIN<00:01:34.380> number<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:34.799> when

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
selling it posted the VIN number so when

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.499 
selling it posted the VIN number so when
you<00:01:35.070> do<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.280> simple<00:01:35.579> search<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.119> VIN<00:01:36.240> number

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
you do a simple search of the VIN number

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.210 
you do a simple search of the VIN number
it<00:01:36.720> takes<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.380> this<00:01:37.470> information<00:01:37.770> here

for sale at that point I can only assume

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.530

that that is where Rockstar about it

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.609 
that that is where Rockstar about it
that<00:01:57.750> would<00:01:57.840> have<00:01:57.930> been<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.590> know

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
that would have been you know

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.230 
that would have been you know
appropriate<00:01:59.009> timing<00:01:59.579> with<00:01:59.729> grand<00:02:00.030> theft<00:02:00.119> auto

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
appropriate timing with grand theft auto

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.690 
appropriate timing with grand theft auto
5<00:02:00.479> coming<00:02:00.840> out<00:02:01.079> you<00:02:01.530> know<00:02:01.590> roughly<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.100> year

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
5 coming out you know roughly a year

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.130 
5 coming out you know roughly a year
year<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.180> half<00:02:03.270> later<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:04.020> that's

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
year and a half later and that's

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.330 
year and a half later and that's
probably<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.500> point<00:02:04.710> where<00:02:04.860> they<00:02:05.040> bought<00:02:05.189> it

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
probably the point where they bought it

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.039 
probably the point where they bought it
from<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:05.700> seller<00:02:05.969> because<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:06.600> really<00:02:06.899> don't

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
from that seller because I really don't

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.059 
from that seller because I really don't
think<00:02:07.140> that<00:02:07.350> there<00:02:07.469> would<00:02:07.590> have<00:02:07.680> been<00:02:07.740> time

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
think that there would have been time

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.740 
think that there would have been time
for<00:02:08.099> another<00:02:08.520> owner<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:09.149> be<00:02:09.239> crammed<00:02:09.569> in

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
for another owner to be crammed in

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.089 
for another owner to be crammed in
between<00:02:10.080> there<00:02:10.259> so<00:02:10.289> I<00:02:10.440> assume<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:10.830> this<00:02:10.920> is<00:02:11.069> a

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
between there so I assume that this is a

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.350 
between there so I assume that this is a
point<00:02:11.250> where<00:02:11.430> Rockstar<00:02:11.849> bought<00:02:12.000> it<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.270> then

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
point where Rockstar bought it and then

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.680 
point where Rockstar bought it and then
they

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
they

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.480 
they
all<00:02:12.810> of<00:02:12.990> the<00:02:13.110> necessary<00:02:13.530> modifications<00:02:13.740> to

all of the necessary modifications to

all of the necessary modifications to
turn<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:14.880> into<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.510> gta5<00:02:16.080> Banshee<00:02:16.650> but<00:02:17.190> the

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
turn it into the gta5 Banshee but the

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.970 
turn it into the gta5 Banshee but the
price<00:02:17.490> tag<00:02:17.520> was<00:02:18.110> $60,000<00:02:19.110> right<00:02:19.590> off<00:02:19.710> the<00:02:19.830> bat

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
price tag was $60,000 right off the bat

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.530 
price tag was $60,000 right off the bat
you<00:02:20.520> know<00:02:20.610> don't<00:02:20.880> assume<00:02:21.060> that<00:02:21.210> they<00:02:21.330> paid

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
you know don't assume that they paid

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.210 
you know don't assume that they paid
sixty<00:02:21.930> thousand<00:02:22.380> they<00:02:22.470> probably<00:02:22.800> offered

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
sixty thousand they probably offered

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.010 
sixty thousand they probably offered
something<00:02:23.490> like<00:02:23.760> fifty<00:02:24.120> fifty-five<00:02:24.450> and<00:02:24.630> got
