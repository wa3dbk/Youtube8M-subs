00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
the optional objectives are well at

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.460 
the optional objectives are well at
least<00:00:29.760> one<00:00:30.029> or<00:00:30.150> two<00:00:30.179> one<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.750> two<00:00:31.080> are<00:00:31.260> very

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
least one or two one of the two are very

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.020 
least one or two one of the two are very
simple<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.920> other<00:00:32.040> ones<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.399> little<00:00:32.579> tricky

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
simple the other ones a little tricky

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.900 
simple the other ones a little tricky
but<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.770> I<00:00:34.770> don't<00:00:35.040> expect<00:00:35.460> any<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:35.820> will

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
but I I don't expect any of you will

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.479 
but I I don't expect any of you will
have<00:00:36.090> really<00:00:36.390> any<00:00:36.540> problems<00:00:36.989> with<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.260> so<00:00:37.500> this

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
have really any problems with it so this

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.860 
have really any problems with it so this
is<00:00:38.550> more<00:00:38.910> like<00:00:38.940> gimme<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.390> said<00:00:39.719> it's<00:00:39.840> just

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
is more like gimme I said it's just

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.139 
is more like gimme I said it's just
basically<00:00:40.260> setting<00:00:40.530> up<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.710> story<00:00:41.149> elaborating

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
basically setting up a story elaborating

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.190 
basically setting up a story elaborating
a<00:00:42.180> little<00:00:42.360> bit<00:00:42.450> more<00:00:42.629> on<00:00:42.690> what's<00:00:42.870> going<00:00:43.110> on

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
a little bit more on what's going on

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.260 
a little bit more on what's going on
things<00:00:43.530> like<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.489> also<00:00:44.610> introduces

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
things like that and it also introduces

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.389 
things like that and it also introduces
the<00:00:45.480> shooting<00:00:45.870> mechanics<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.469> game<00:00:46.649> so

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
the shooting mechanics to the game so

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.740 
the shooting mechanics to the game so
that's<00:00:47.879> really<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.239> whole<00:00:48.329> point<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:48.629> this

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
that's really the whole point in this

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.290 
that's really the whole point in this
mission<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:49.370> mean<00:00:50.370> as<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.670> most<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:50.910> guys<00:00:51.120> know

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
mission I mean as you most you guys know

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.029 
mission I mean as you most you guys know
by<00:00:51.480> now<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.809> first<00:00:51.989> sequence<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.590> first<00:00:52.620> two

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
by now the first sequence the first two

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.160 
by now the first sequence the first two
sequences<00:00:53.550> are<00:00:53.820> usually<00:00:54.180> just<00:00:54.420> introducing

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
sequences are usually just introducing

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.779 
sequences are usually just introducing
all<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.500> mechanics<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.100> game<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.579> trying

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
all the mechanics of the game and trying

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.540 
all the mechanics of the game and trying
to<00:00:56.850> readjust<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:58.109> don't<00:00:59.010> nothing

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
to readjust you to it so I don't nothing

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.040 
to readjust you to it so I don't nothing
really<00:00:59.730> happens<00:01:00.180> until<00:01:00.420> sequence<00:01:00.809> three

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
really happens until sequence three

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.529 
really happens until sequence three
that's<00:01:01.170> when<00:01:01.350> it's<00:01:01.469> really<00:01:01.800> really<00:01:01.949> starts<00:01:02.699> it

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
that's when it's really really starts it

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.160 
that's when it's really really starts it
starts<00:01:04.350> getting<00:01:04.949> really<00:01:05.100> good<00:01:05.810> okay<00:01:06.810> there<00:01:07.020> we

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
starts getting really good okay there we

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.590 
starts getting really good okay there we
go<00:01:07.260> we<00:01:07.439> got<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:08.630> the<00:01:09.630> first<00:01:09.840> ops<00:01:10.049> up

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
go we got it so the first ops up

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.140 
go we got it so the first ops up

something<00:01:37.710> like<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.060> so<00:01:39.060> there<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.329> go<00:01:39.450> I

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
something like that so there you go I

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.330 
something like that so there you go I
shot<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.110> first<00:01:40.290> three<00:01:40.560> or<00:01:40.740> four<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.159> then<00:01:41.250> it

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
shot the first three or four and then it

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.130 
shot the first three or four and then it
popped<00:01:41.520> up<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:42.090> one<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.390> want<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.840> bottom

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
popped up the one you want is the bottom

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.859 
popped up the one you want is the bottom
right<00:01:43.700> so<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.909> says<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.509> one<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.750> says

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
right so it says the one that says

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.240 
right so it says the one that says
challenge<00:01:46.320> not<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.619> one<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:46.829> says<00:01:46.979> continue

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
challenge not the one that says continue

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.600 
challenge not the one that says continue
so<00:01:48.320> be<00:01:49.320> sure<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.619> reload<00:01:49.950> before<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.369> start

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
so be sure you reload before you start

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.649 
so be sure you reload before you start
this<00:01:50.729> because<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.060> reload<00:01:51.299> will<00:01:51.540> kill<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:53.659> as

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
this because the reload will kill you as

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.179 
this because the reload will kill you as
you<00:01:54.780> can<00:01:54.899> see<00:01:55.049> there<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.500> just<00:01:55.680> talked<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.009> him

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
you can see there I just talked to him

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.749 
you can see there I just talked to him
so<00:01:56.610> it's<00:01:57.000> gonna<00:01:57.119> start<00:01:57.360> here<00:01:57.630> in<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.750> second

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
so it's gonna start here in a second

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.899 
so it's gonna start here in a second
come<00:01:59.759> on<00:02:00.770> there<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:01.829> go<00:02:02.009> so<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:02.460> got<00:02:02.579> 22

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
come on there you go so you got 22

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.760 
come on there you go so you got 22
seconds<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.270> shoot<00:02:03.420> all<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.630> targets<00:02:03.960> it's<00:02:04.619> a

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
seconds to shoot all the targets it's a

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.740 
seconds to shoot all the targets it's a
lot<00:02:04.920> easier<00:02:05.130> if<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.579> just<00:02:05.729> use<00:02:05.939> try<00:02:06.270> the

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
lot easier if you just use try the

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.869 
lot easier if you just use try the
triangle<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.320> shoot<00:02:07.530> instead<00:02:07.829> of<00:02:08.009> aiming<00:02:08.160> but

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
triangle to shoot instead of aiming but

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.119 
triangle to shoot instead of aiming but
if<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.090> have<00:02:09.239> good<00:02:09.450> aim<00:02:09.599> like<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:10.110> sort<00:02:10.770> of<00:02:10.920> do

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
if you have good aim like I sort of do

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.980 
if you have good aim like I sort of do
you<00:02:11.760> shouldn't<00:02:12.090> really<00:02:12.180> have<00:02:12.390> any<00:02:12.569> problem

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
you shouldn't really have any problem

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.580 
you shouldn't really have any problem
completing<00:02:13.320> this<00:02:13.500> as<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:14.460> can<00:02:14.490> see<00:02:14.610> I<00:02:15.020> I<00:02:16.020> could

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
completing this as you can see I I could

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.470 
completing this as you can see I I could
have<00:02:16.680> done<00:02:16.800> a<00:02:16.830> lot<00:02:16.980> better<00:02:17.040> but<00:02:17.610> I<00:02:17.640> think<00:02:18.180> what

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
have done a lot better but I think what

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.060 
have done a lot better but I think what
I<00:02:18.510> just<00:02:18.750> finished<00:02:19.020> with<00:02:19.110> I<00:02:19.410> finished<00:02:19.950> with

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
I just finished with I finished with

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.500 
I just finished with I finished with
like<00:02:20.190> a<00:02:20.220> second<00:02:20.730> left<00:02:20.880> on<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.090> clock<00:02:21.300> and

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
like a second left on the clock and

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.930 
like a second left on the clock and
probably<00:02:21.960> a<00:02:21.990> lot<00:02:22.140> less<00:02:22.320> than<00:02:22.500> that<00:02:22.560> but<00:02:22.940> said

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
probably a lot less than that but said

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.250 
probably a lot less than that but said
if<00:02:24.060> you<00:02:24.150> use<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.450> triangle<00:02:24.690> feature<00:02:24.990> that

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
if you use the triangle feature that

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.650 
if you use the triangle feature that
they<00:02:25.350> have<00:02:25.500> like<00:02:26.100> Auto<00:02:26.340> aims<00:02:26.610> for<00:02:26.880> you<00:02:27.000> you

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
they have like Auto aims for you you

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.390 
they have like Auto aims for you you
shouldn't<00:02:27.960> really<00:02:28.050> have<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.260> problem<00:02:28.680> and

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
shouldn't really have a problem and

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.120 
shouldn't really have a problem and
you'll<00:02:29.760> get<00:02:29.880> a<00:02:29.940> free<00:02:30.120> optional<00:02:30.480> objective<00:02:30.840> so

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
you'll get a free optional objective so

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.930 
you'll get a free optional objective so
once<00:02:32.130> you're<00:02:32.250> done<00:02:32.340> with<00:02:32.490> that<00:02:32.550> just<00:02:32.790> hit

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
once you're done with that just hit

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.670 
once you're done with that just hit
continue<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.480> it'll<00:02:34.140> trigger<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.380> short

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
continue and it'll trigger a short

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.620 
continue and it'll trigger a short
cutscene<00:02:35.070> and<00:02:37.580> there<00:02:38.580> you<00:02:38.670> go

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
cutscene and there you go

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.840 
cutscene and there you go
so<00:02:40.410> now<00:02:40.800> we're<00:02:40.980> gonna<00:02:41.100> continue<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.550> mission

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
so now we're gonna continue the mission

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.810 
so now we're gonna continue the mission
and<00:02:45.770> now<00:02:46.770> we're<00:02:46.920> gonna<00:02:47.010> perform<00:02:47.370> some

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
and now we're gonna perform some

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.540 
and now we're gonna perform some
assassins<00:02:48.360> because<00:02:48.630> our<00:02:49.170> assassins<00:02:49.890> we're

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
assassins because our assassins we're

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.700 
assassins because our assassins we're
going<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:51.090> perform<00:02:51.270> some<00:02:51.710> assassinations

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
going to perform some assassinations

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.920 
going to perform some assassinations
because<00:02:53.640> they<00:02:54.000> just<00:02:54.180> want<00:02:54.390> to<00:02:54.420> see<00:02:54.570> what<00:02:54.810> we

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
because they just want to see what we

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.690 
because they just want to see what we
got<00:02:55.140> in<00:02:55.320> terms<00:02:55.500> of<00:02:55.680> skills<00:02:55.920> so<00:02:56.190> like<00:02:56.580> I<00:02:56.640> said

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
got in terms of skills so like I said

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.520 
got in terms of skills so like I said
that<00:02:57.570> was<00:02:57.690> introduced<00:02:58.110> in<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.260> shooting

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
that was introduced in the shooting

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.510 
that was introduced in the shooting
mechanics<00:02:58.980> this<00:02:59.100> is<00:02:59.160> going<00:02:59.400> to<00:02:59.460> be

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
mechanics this is going to be

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.510 
mechanics this is going to be
introducing<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.620> assassinate<00:03:01.620> mechanics

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
introducing the assassinate mechanics

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.630 
introducing the assassinate mechanics
and<00:03:03.470> if<00:03:04.470> you<00:03:04.680> ever<00:03:04.920> played<00:03:05.160> an<00:03:05.250> assassin's

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
and if you ever played an assassin's

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.470 
and if you ever played an assassin's
creed<00:03:05.820> and<00:03:05.940> you<00:03:06.030> don't<00:03:06.150> member<00:03:06.300> how<00:03:06.390> to

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
creed and you don't member how to

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.680 
creed and you don't member how to
assassinate<00:03:06.930> somebody<00:03:07.550> mmm<00:03:08.640> little<00:03:09.450> sketchy

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
assassinate somebody mmm little sketchy

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.390 
assassinate somebody mmm little sketchy
there<00:03:09.960> because<00:03:10.350> it's<00:03:10.860> basically<00:03:11.280> just

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
there because it's basically just

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.210 
there because it's basically just
holding<00:03:11.850> square<00:03:12.390> so<00:03:12.750> I<00:03:12.990> said<00:03:13.710> it'll<00:03:13.860> just<00:03:14.100> give

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
holding square so I said it'll just give

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.620 
holding square so I said it'll just give
you<00:03:14.310> a<00:03:14.370> bunch<00:03:14.580> of<00:03:14.670> different<00:03:14.820> ones<00:03:15.120> this<00:03:15.450> one

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
you a bunch of different ones this one

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.720 
you a bunch of different ones this one
the<00:03:15.870> first<00:03:15.960> one<00:03:16.080> is<00:03:16.200> just<00:03:16.470> just<00:03:17.460> stabbing

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
the first one is just just stabbing

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.210 
the first one is just just stabbing
anybody<00:03:18.210> the<00:03:18.960> second<00:03:19.290> one<00:03:19.470> is<00:03:19.650> going<00:03:19.860> to<00:03:20.010> be

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
anybody the second one is going to be

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.060 
anybody the second one is going to be
stabbing<00:03:20.790> somebody<00:03:21.120> from<00:03:21.390> a<00:03:21.450> hay-bale<00:03:22.070> you'll

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
stabbing somebody from a hay-bale you'll

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.230 
stabbing somebody from a hay-bale you'll
see<00:03:23.220> it<00:03:23.310> pop<00:03:23.460> up<00:03:23.490> in<00:03:23.670> there<00:03:23.760> in<00:03:23.820> a<00:03:23.850> second<00:03:24.090> yeah

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
see it pop up in there in a second yeah

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
see it pop up in there in a second yeah
there<00:03:24.900> you<00:03:24.960> go

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
there you go

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.860 
there you go
and<00:03:26.190> if<00:03:26.910> you're<00:03:27.030> wondering<00:03:27.180> why<00:03:27.450> I'm<00:03:27.690> like

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
and if you're wondering why I'm like

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.630 
and if you're wondering why I'm like
running<00:03:28.470> to<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:28.830> areas<00:03:29.190> before<00:03:29.460> it's<00:03:29.580> even

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
running to the areas before it's even

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.800 
running to the areas before it's even
telling<00:03:29.940> me<00:03:29.970> what<00:03:30.120> to<00:03:30.150> do<00:03:30.300> it's<00:03:30.450> because<00:03:30.510> this

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
telling me what to do it's because this

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.240 
telling me what to do it's because this
is<00:03:30.870> actually<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.350> second<00:03:31.710> time<00:03:31.740> I've<00:03:31.890> played

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
is actually the second time I've played

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.120 
is actually the second time I've played
this<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:33.510> first<00:03:33.720> time<00:03:33.870> I<00:03:33.900> missed<00:03:34.200> actually

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
this the first time I missed actually

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.400 
this the first time I missed actually
both<00:03:35.340> of<00:03:35.520> the<00:03:35.610> optional<00:03:35.970> objectives<00:03:36.120> so<00:03:36.690> I<00:03:36.900> had

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
both of the optional objectives so I had

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
if you're playing on xbox

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:13.910 
if you're playing on xbox
it's<00:04:06.590> either<00:04:09.650> X<00:04:10.650> maybe<00:04:11.630> X<00:04:12.630> or<00:04:12.959> I<00:04:13.350> don't<00:04:13.650> know<00:04:13.740> I

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
it's either X maybe X or I don't know I

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.940 
it's either X maybe X or I don't know I
I<00:04:13.980> don't<00:04:14.430> play<00:04:14.640> xbox<00:04:14.940> I<00:04:15.360> probably<00:04:16.080> should<00:04:16.560> at

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
I don't play xbox I probably should at

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.410 
I don't play xbox I probably should at
least<00:04:17.160> look<00:04:17.459> at<00:04:17.549> the<00:04:17.670> controller<00:04:18.000> before<00:04:18.390> I

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:18.420 
least look at the controller before I

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.750 
least look at the controller before I
start<00:04:18.750> these<00:04:18.959> but<00:04:19.350> I<00:04:19.590> don't<00:04:20.430> know<00:04:20.489> I<00:04:20.580> think

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
start these but I don't know I think

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.409 
start these but I don't know I think
it's<00:04:20.850> more<00:04:20.970> fun<00:04:21.210> just<00:04:21.450> run<00:04:21.540> I<00:04:21.600> guess

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
it's more fun just run I guess

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:26.210 
it's more fun just run I guess
so<00:04:24.419> after<00:04:24.840> that<00:04:24.930> we're<00:04:25.080> gonna<00:04:25.229> follow<00:04:25.590> our

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
so after that we're gonna follow our

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.059 
so after that we're gonna follow our
hosts<00:04:26.759> for<00:04:26.819> a<00:04:27.000> little<00:04:27.180> bit<00:04:27.889> they're<00:04:28.889> gonna<00:04:28.979> be

00:04:29.059 --> 00:04:29.069 
hosts for a little bit they're gonna be

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:30.170 
hosts for a little bit they're gonna be
talking<00:04:29.280> about<00:04:29.340> some<00:04:29.610> background<00:04:30.000> on<00:04:30.060> the

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
talking about some background on the

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.909 
talking about some background on the
characters<00:04:30.600> so<00:04:31.229> if<00:04:31.349> you're<00:04:31.500> interested<00:04:31.860> in

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
characters so if you're interested in

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:34.100 
characters so if you're interested in
that<00:04:31.979> make<00:04:32.699> sure<00:04:32.819> you<00:04:32.910> listen<00:04:33.090> to<00:04:33.240> them<00:04:33.479> it

I<00:04:34.590> mean<00:04:35.130> I'm<00:04:35.310> hasn't<00:04:35.729> really<00:04:35.880> done<00:04:35.940> anything

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
I mean I'm hasn't really done anything

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.260 
I mean I'm hasn't really done anything
for<00:04:36.270> the<00:04:36.360> story<00:04:36.599> as<00:04:36.870> of<00:04:37.319> the<00:04:37.410> point<00:04:37.650> I'm<00:04:37.800> at<00:04:38.009> but

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
for the story as of the point I'm at but

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.159 
for the story as of the point I'm at but
it's<00:04:39.270> always<00:04:39.419> nice<00:04:39.630> to<00:04:39.690> get<00:04:39.870> a<00:04:39.930> little

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
it's always nice to get a little

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.230 
it's always nice to get a little
background<00:04:40.319> so<00:04:40.710> that<00:04:40.740> way<00:04:40.949> you<00:04:41.009> just<00:04:41.130> you<00:04:42.060> feel

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
background so that way you just you feel

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.640 
background so that way you just you feel
more<00:04:42.479> immersed<00:04:43.110> in<00:04:43.319> the<00:04:43.410> game<00:04:45.199> but<00:04:46.199> after<00:04:46.380> this

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
more immersed in the game but after this

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.010 
more immersed in the game but after this
is<00:04:46.800> real<00:04:46.949> that's<00:04:47.130> really<00:04:47.340> the<00:04:47.460> whole<00:04:47.940> like<00:04:48.900> the

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
is real that's really the whole like the

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.320 
is real that's really the whole like the
mission<00:04:49.229> is<00:04:49.289> basically<00:04:49.620> over<00:04:49.830> the<00:04:50.580> only<00:04:51.120> thing

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
mission is basically over the only thing

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.930 
mission is basically over the only thing
left<00:04:51.509> is<00:04:51.720> just<00:04:51.900> a<00:04:52.139> couple<00:04:52.530> cutscenes<00:04:53.099> and<00:04:53.310> the

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
left is just a couple cutscenes and the

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.270 
left is just a couple cutscenes and the
last<00:04:54.150> optional<00:04:54.599> objective<00:04:54.990> which<00:04:55.650> is<00:04:55.680> super

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
last optional objective which is super

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.070 
last optional objective which is super
easy<00:04:56.520> that<00:04:56.669> I<00:04:56.849> can't<00:04:57.270> even<00:04:57.479> believe<00:04:57.630> it's<00:04:57.990> an

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
easy that I can't even believe it's an

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.290 
easy that I can't even believe it's an
optional<00:04:58.440> objective<00:04:58.919> like<00:04:59.610> it's<00:04:59.820> really<00:05:00.060> cool

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
optional objective like it's really cool

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.879 
optional objective like it's really cool
and<00:05:00.570> I<00:05:00.870> was<00:05:00.990> interesting<00:05:01.410> but<00:05:01.910> it's<00:05:03.500> yeah<00:05:04.500> it's

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
and I was interesting but it's yeah it's

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:08.390 
and I was interesting but it's yeah it's
just<00:05:05.070> really<00:05:05.220> simple<00:05:05.639> and<00:05:06.919> the<00:05:07.919> only<00:05:08.039> reason<00:05:08.340> I

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
just really simple and the only reason I

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.310 
just really simple and the only reason I
didn't<00:05:08.699> do<00:05:08.820> it<00:05:08.940> the<00:05:09.030> first<00:05:09.060> time<00:05:09.449> because<00:05:10.080> I

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
didn't do it the first time because I

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.570 
didn't do it the first time because I
know<00:05:10.380> a<00:05:10.470> lot<00:05:10.650> of<00:05:10.680> you<00:05:10.800> saying<00:05:10.979> well<00:05:11.160> if<00:05:11.220> so<00:05:11.400> easy

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
know a lot of you saying well if so easy

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:12.890 
know a lot of you saying well if so easy
why<00:05:11.789> didn't<00:05:12.060> you<00:05:12.120> do<00:05:12.240> it<00:05:12.330> the<00:05:12.419> first<00:05:12.539> time<00:05:12.690> was

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
why didn't you do it the first time was

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.810 
why didn't you do it the first time was
cuz<00:05:13.080> I<00:05:13.289> was<00:05:13.830> kind<00:05:14.009> of<00:05:14.039> nervous<00:05:14.280> that<00:05:14.430> I<00:05:14.610> would

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
cuz I was kind of nervous that I would

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.680 
cuz I was kind of nervous that I would
uh<00:05:14.849> that<00:05:15.680> it<00:05:16.680> would<00:05:17.030> ruin<00:05:18.030> the<00:05:18.360> rest<00:05:18.479> of<00:05:18.570> the

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
uh that it would ruin the rest of the

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.390 
uh that it would ruin the rest of the
mission<00:05:18.810> for<00:05:19.050> me<00:05:19.169> so<00:05:19.349> I<00:05:19.380> was<00:05:19.770> kind<00:05:20.220> of<00:05:20.250> waiting

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
mission for me so I was kind of waiting

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.070 
mission for me so I was kind of waiting
to<00:05:20.610> see<00:05:20.759> if<00:05:20.880> it<00:05:21.060> would<00:05:21.180> happen<00:05:21.720> in<00:05:21.960> this

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
to see if it would happen in this

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.260 
to see if it would happen in this
different<00:05:22.409> point<00:05:22.680> but<00:05:22.889> it<00:05:22.979> doesn't<00:05:23.250> so<00:05:23.430> so

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
different point but it doesn't so so

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.430 
different point but it doesn't so so
after<00:05:24.360> the<00:05:24.569> cutscene<00:05:24.840> you'll<00:05:24.960> see<00:05:25.080> it<00:05:25.199> pop<00:05:25.409> up

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
after the cutscene you'll see it pop up

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.730 
after the cutscene you'll see it pop up
as<00:05:25.680> a<00:05:25.770> pickpocket<00:05:26.009> all<00:05:26.490> Templars<00:05:27.000> 0<00:05:27.840> of<00:05:27.960> 3<00:05:28.080> so

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
as a pickpocket all Templars 0 of 3 so

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.350 
as a pickpocket all Templars 0 of 3 so
basically<00:05:29.070> just<00:05:29.159> stand<00:05:29.490> behind<00:05:29.639> each<00:05:30.030> one<00:05:30.240> of

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
basically just stand behind each one of

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.700 
basically just stand behind each one of
them<00:05:30.509> and<00:05:30.720> just<00:05:30.990> hold<00:05:31.139> circle<00:05:31.470> and<00:05:31.680> just

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
them and just hold circle and just

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.620 
them and just hold circle and just
pickpocket<00:05:32.610> them<00:05:32.729> they<00:05:33.090> actually<00:05:33.360> give<00:05:33.479> you<00:05:33.570> a

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
pickpocket them they actually give you a

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.260 
pickpocket them they actually give you a
pretty<00:05:33.870> decent<00:05:34.199> amount<00:05:34.259> of<00:05:34.440> money<00:05:34.590> so<00:05:34.889> I<00:05:35.789> think

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
pretty decent amount of money so I think

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.430 
pretty decent amount of money so I think
I<00:05:36.330> get<00:05:36.479> like<00:05:36.509> almost<00:05:36.930> 750<00:05:37.590> reals<00:05:39.199> but<00:05:40.199> right

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
I get like almost 750 reals but right

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.680 
I get like almost 750 reals but right
there<00:05:40.590> that's<00:05:40.710> it<00:05:40.949> that's<00:05:41.699> the<00:05:42.000> the<00:05:42.330> optional

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
there that's it that's the the optional

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.300 
there that's it that's the the optional
objective<00:05:42.990> for<00:05:43.110> you<00:05:43.229> so<00:05:43.409> you've<00:05:43.650> now<00:05:43.830> hundred

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
objective for you so you've now hundred

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.820 
objective for you so you've now hundred
percent<00:05:44.610> sync<00:05:44.940> the<00:05:45.270> mission<00:05:45.599> and<00:05:45.830> this

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
percent sync the mission and this

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.200 
percent sync the mission and this
missions<00:05:47.159> really<00:05:47.250> over<00:05:47.580> the<00:05:47.880> rest<00:05:48.060> of<00:05:48.150> the

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
missions really over the rest of the

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.520 
missions really over the rest of the
missions<00:05:48.479> just<00:05:48.659> basically<00:05:49.020> standing<00:05:49.349> here

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530 
missions just basically standing here

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.439 
missions just basically standing here
just<00:05:49.560> listening<00:05:50.070> to<00:05:50.389> everything<00:05:51.389> that's

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:51.449 
just listening to everything that's

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:54.260 
just listening to everything that's
going<00:05:51.719> on<00:05:51.840> and<00:05:52.219> the<00:05:53.219> reason<00:05:53.490> why<00:05:53.580> I<00:05:53.820> tried<00:05:54.150> to

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
going on and the reason why I tried to

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.300 
going on and the reason why I tried to
check<00:05:54.389> the<00:05:54.570> progress<00:05:54.719> but<00:05:55.349> I<00:05:55.530> actually<00:05:55.860> had<00:05:56.190> to

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
check the progress but I actually had to

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:00.379 
check the progress but I actually had to
redo<00:05:56.969> this<00:05:57.150> mission<00:05:57.449> like<00:05:58.789> go<00:05:59.789> in<00:05:59.969> and<00:06:00.000> replay

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:00.389 
redo this mission like go in and replay

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:02.330 
redo this mission like go in and replay
it<00:06:00.570> and<00:06:00.690> apparently<00:06:01.440> in<00:06:01.560> replay<00:06:01.830> doesn't<00:06:02.190> tell

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
it and apparently in replay doesn't tell

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.820 
it and apparently in replay doesn't tell
you<00:06:02.630> like<00:06:03.630> the<00:06:03.840> optional<00:06:04.199> like<00:06:04.530> if<00:06:04.680> you've

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
you like the optional like if you've

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.040 
you like the optional like if you've
