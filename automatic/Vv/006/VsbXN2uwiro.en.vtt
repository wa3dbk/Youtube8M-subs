00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
flexible it seems like it could still do

project<00:01:40.530> now<00:01:41.530> this<00:01:41.860> filter<00:01:42.159> it's<00:01:42.430> got<00:01:42.670> a

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
project now this filter it's got a

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:51.780 
project now this filter it's got a
plastic<00:01:46.530> end<00:01:47.530> cap<00:01:47.950> on<00:01:48.250> it<00:01:49.350> which<00:01:50.350> you<00:01:50.770> know<00:01:51.760> I

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
plastic end cap on it which you know I

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.210 
plastic end cap on it which you know I
guess<00:01:52.090> if<00:01:52.240> you're<00:01:52.420> gonna<00:01:52.650> pry<00:01:53.650> on<00:01:53.680> it<00:01:54.070> it's

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
guess if you're gonna pry on it it's

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.430 
guess if you're gonna pry on it it's
gonna<00:01:54.369> break<00:01:54.700> but<00:01:55.060> it<00:01:55.180> seems<00:01:55.540> this<00:01:56.170> one's

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
gonna break but it seems this one's

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.190 
gonna break but it seems this one's
brittle<00:01:59.610> but<00:02:00.610> obviously<00:02:01.090> it<00:02:01.330> did<00:02:01.540> its<00:02:01.720> job<00:02:01.780> you

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
brittle but obviously it did its job you

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.260 
brittle but obviously it did its job you
can<00:02:02.380> see<00:02:02.590> where<00:02:02.800> the<00:02:03.420> where<00:02:04.420> these<00:02:04.570> bumps<00:02:04.960> are

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
can see where the where these bumps are

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.560 
can see where the where these bumps are
this<00:02:07.270> parts<00:02:07.660> it's<00:02:07.900> alright<00:02:08.229> right<00:02:08.950> on<00:02:09.160> there

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
this parts it's alright right on there

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.530 
this parts it's alright right on there
actually<00:02:10.570> what<00:02:10.810> has<00:02:10.929> happened<00:02:11.350> here<00:02:11.650> is<00:02:12.540> this

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
actually what has happened here is this

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.010 
actually what has happened here is this
is<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:13.900> glue<00:02:15.090> now<00:02:16.090> that<00:02:16.300> I<00:02:16.330> think<00:02:16.360> about<00:02:16.630> it

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
is the glue now that I think about it

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.660 
is the glue now that I think about it
and<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.260> glue<00:02:17.500> is<00:02:17.530> separated<00:02:18.310> from<00:02:18.340> this

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
and the glue is separated from this

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.630 
and the glue is separated from this
piece<00:02:19.110> this<00:02:20.110> piece<00:02:20.170> is<00:02:20.590> supposed<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:21.040> stapling

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
piece this piece is supposed to stapling

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.130 
piece this piece is supposed to stapling
it<00:02:21.730> on<00:02:21.880> there<00:02:24.450> but<00:02:25.450> in<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.630> case<00:02:25.840> of<00:02:26.050> this

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
it on there but in the case of this

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.720 
it on there but in the case of this
filter<00:02:26.590> it<00:02:26.830> has<00:02:26.980> separated<00:02:28.920> but<00:02:29.920> overall<00:02:30.250> I

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
filter it has separated but overall I

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.699 
filter it has separated but overall I
mean<00:02:30.940> you<00:02:31.239> can<00:02:31.390> look<00:02:31.480> at<00:02:31.690> it<00:02:31.840> and<00:02:32.320> that's<00:02:32.440> when

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
mean you can look at it and that's when

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.860 
mean you can look at it and that's when
filter<00:02:33.130> elements<00:02:33.580> joined<00:02:33.820> right<00:02:34.120> there<00:02:36.870> I've

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
filter elements joined right there I've

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.990 
filter elements joined right there I've
heard<00:02:38.050> good<00:02:38.230> things<00:02:38.290> about<00:02:38.620> Ford<00:02:39.100> mode<00:02:39.310> Ford

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
heard good things about Ford mode Ford

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.400 
heard good things about Ford mode Ford

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:54.460 

pleat<00:02:49.040> here<00:02:49.280> seems<00:02:49.610> all<00:02:49.880> right<00:02:53.470> doesn't

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
pleat here seems all right doesn't

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.450 
pleat here seems all right doesn't
really<00:02:54.560> want<00:02:54.950> to<00:02:55.040> separate<00:02:55.520> but<00:02:55.910> the<00:02:57.460> this

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
really want to separate but the this

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.240 
really want to separate but the this
glue<00:02:59.030> that<00:02:59.300> they<00:02:59.450> used<00:02:59.780> is<00:03:00.050> really<00:03:00.500> cooked<00:03:00.860> now

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
glue that they used is really cooked now

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.480 
glue that they used is really cooked now
that's<00:03:01.580> either<00:03:01.850> I'd<00:03:02.720> have<00:03:02.840> to<00:03:03.020> get<00:03:03.170> a<00:03:03.200> new<00:03:03.490> I'd
