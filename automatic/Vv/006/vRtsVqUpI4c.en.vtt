feedback that we get in from the
community<00:00:42.750> can<00:00:43.020> really<00:00:43.290> help<00:00:43.379> us<00:00:43.559> fix

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
community can really help us fix

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.680 
community can really help us fix
critical<00:00:44.489> bugs<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:44.789> we<00:00:44.940> need<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.120> fix<00:00:45.329> now<00:00:45.539> in

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
critical bugs that we need to fix now in

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.139 
critical bugs that we need to fix now in
the<00:00:45.780> last<00:00:45.930> weeks<00:00:46.770> before<00:00:47.190> ship<00:00:47.430> but<00:00:48.000> more

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
the last weeks before ship but more

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.840 
the last weeks before ship but more
importantly<00:00:48.629> I<00:00:48.719> mean<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.110> launch<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:50.010> the

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
importantly I mean the launch of the the

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.430 
importantly I mean the launch of the the
actual<00:00:51.120> game<00:00:51.149> battlefield<00:00:51.780> 3<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.170> just<00:00:52.350> the

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
actual game battlefield 3 is just the

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.750 
actual game battlefield 3 is just the
start<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.949> something<00:00:53.160> we're<00:00:53.399> going<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.670> take

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
start of something we're going to take

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.069 
start of something we're going to take
care<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.059> this<00:00:54.210> property<00:00:54.510> for<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.660> long<00:00:54.840> period

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
care of this property for a long period

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.260 
care of this property for a long period
of<00:00:55.260> time<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:56.070> anything<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.460> crops<00:00:56.850> up<00:00:57.030> now

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
of time so anything that crops up now

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.849 
of time so anything that crops up now
during<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.660> beta<00:00:57.809> we<00:00:58.199> can<00:00:58.350> then<00:00:58.500> work<00:00:58.620> with

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
during the beta we can then work with

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.170 
during the beta we can then work with
doing<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.219> updates<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.760> everything<00:01:00.030> else

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
doing the updates and everything else

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.180 
doing the updates and everything else
coming<00:01:00.449> out<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:01.440> we're<00:01:01.559> sorry<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:01.890> we<00:01:02.010> need

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
coming out and we're sorry and we need

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.619 
coming out and we're sorry and we need
to<00:01:02.280> start<00:01:02.460> doing<00:01:02.579> this<00:01:02.789> now<00:01:03.059> because<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.480> takes

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
to start doing this now because it takes

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.390 
to start doing this now because it takes
the<00:01:03.750> time<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:03.960> do<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.199> so<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:05.010> quicker<00:01:05.189> we

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
the time to do that so the quicker we

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.710 
the time to do that so the quicker we
can<00:01:05.430> get<00:01:05.640> this<00:01:05.790> feedback<00:01:05.970> before<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.570> launch

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
can get this feedback before the launch

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.620 
can get this feedback before the launch
the<00:01:06.990> better<00:01:07.290> for<00:01:07.500> us<00:01:07.610> ok<00:01:08.610> I'm<00:01:08.970> in<00:01:09.119> particular

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
the better for us ok I'm in particular

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.120 
the better for us ok I'm in particular
about<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.960> technology<00:01:10.290> behind<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.950> game

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
about the technology behind the game

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.520 
about the technology behind the game
what<00:01:11.880> really<00:01:12.270> has<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.510> extra<00:01:12.900> power<00:01:13.140> that

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
what really has the extra power that

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.899 
what really has the extra power that
obviously<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.159> have<00:01:14.369> now<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.610> latest

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
obviously you have now the latest

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.780 
obviously you have now the latest
graphics<00:01:15.240> cards<00:01:15.920> really<00:01:16.920> enabled<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.520> do

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
graphics cards really enabled you to do

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.940 
graphics cards really enabled you to do
that<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.090> perhaps<00:01:18.270> weren't<00:01:19.049> able<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.380> do<00:01:19.619> with

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
that you perhaps weren't able to do with

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.880 
that you perhaps weren't able to do with
back<00:01:20.220> till<00:01:20.520> two<00:01:20.729> or<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:21.420> few<00:01:21.659> years<00:01:21.869> ago<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.290> mean

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
back till two or a few years ago I mean

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.800 
back till two or a few years ago I mean
naturally<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.700> visuals<00:01:24.090> are<00:01:24.330> so<00:01:24.540> much

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
naturally the the visuals are so much

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.120 
naturally the the visuals are so much
better<00:01:24.990> now<00:01:25.290> when<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.530> comes<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.009> in

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
better now when it comes to it and in

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.850 
better now when it comes to it and in
combination<00:01:26.310> we<00:01:26.759> now<00:01:27.240> have<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:28.110> new<00:01:28.500> version

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
combination we now have the new version

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.620 
combination we now have the new version
of<00:01:28.979> our<00:01:29.130> engine<00:01:29.460> frostbite<00:01:29.880> ooze<00:01:30.090> coming<00:01:30.360> in

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
of our engine frostbite ooze coming in

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.569 
of our engine frostbite ooze coming in
really<00:01:30.900> enables<00:01:31.560> us<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.740> use<00:01:32.040> all<00:01:32.250> this<00:01:32.369> power

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
really enables us to use all this power

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.490 
really enables us to use all this power
from<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.030> from<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.659> graphic<00:01:33.960> cards<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.439> the

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
from the from the graphic cards and the
