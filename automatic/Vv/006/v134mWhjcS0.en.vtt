00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.359
 hi everyone is fabien I 'm going 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.010
 present you today a very good 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.260
 glitch on call of duty black ops 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.240
 first of the name a very little known glitch 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.350
 which will allow you to deliver your 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.120
 play time and your deaths to 0 so that's 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.710
 simple enough to achieve just enough 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.450
 to follow the steps I'm going to take you 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.160
 start on this video 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.410
 so I present to you that I am in 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.180
 update 1.13 the very last of 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.590
 call of duty black ops and I you 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.649
 present my stages which I have 15 days 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.110
 of play and 50 thousand dead so you 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.690
 leave you go in split screen and 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.090
 you put in game capture mode of 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.350
 flag on the orange firing map so 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.109
 Its very important 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.550
 once it's done you will celebrate 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.290
 you return to split screen 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.880
 but you do not join you do 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.100
 triangle to open your friends list 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.450
 makes you square to join a friend 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.520
 who is in a group 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.680
 and when you square for the 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.600
 join you strafe the x button of 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.880
 way to launch the local part that 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.470
 you have prepared just before then there 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.080
 an important step is that your friend 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.180
 must open video windows or 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.500
 downloads etc so as to make the 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.450
 war its connection otherwise it does not 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.920
 will not work and there you see that it 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.329
 worked if it worked you 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.520
 go into the game and you see the 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.700
 names of glitch tim and so axis and a 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.350
 brothel and you can not do anything you 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.210
 do start you select your 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.640
 father class this number one and you 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.320
 start playing so why was it 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.990
 very important to put the map firing 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.270
 orange is a flag catch that's 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.740
 that in fact you have to finish a round 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.630
 so that you can do it on any 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.310
 the cases return to agreement take you back 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.520
 the three flags that's why 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.509
 does an accelerated what and when you 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.970
 have finished the round 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.920
 you will start another good 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.380
 obviously but this other round will be 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.270
 special so why in fact does it take 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.780
 that your friend makes you lag and his 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.340
 connection 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.319
 karine hamel does not make war sa 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.340
 connection when you get to 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.440
 loading the party 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.910
 that will automatically exclude you from me 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.830
 do not ask why it's like that 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.790
 in fact your friend will see you 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.440
 in his group 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.430
 seen as you join him as you play 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.790
 at the same time they see you in his 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.000
 group 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.920
 but you play local on screen 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.209
 split up so life when the second 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.560
 part starts see you do not have 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.799
 no weapons no assets nothing 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.970
 hurry up to scale 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:34.410
 suicides and you as soon as possible 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.090
 the time you put it will be the 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.620
 play time that you will have as soon as 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.810
 you are committing suicide you ask your 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.760
 friend who sees you in his group of 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.250
 exclude you from his group once 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.540
 that he excludes you you leave the game 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.200
 is actually when you are going to leave 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.580
 the game this is actually I made the 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.010
 bigger than what glitch and realize 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.390
 when you return to your card 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.040
 of agent you look at your statistics 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.780
 they did not move 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.890
 it's normal you just have to 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.510
 disconnect from the psn and reconnect to 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.549
 once it's done and well your 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.320
 playing time this will be the time you 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.630
 have put you to suicide at the scale 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.920
 during the second run and your dead 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.660
 well they will be 1 1 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.549
 that is, I have one hundred and fifty 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.489
 thousand elimination and 50000 live death on 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:20.250
 lobby at the crossing well I will be 150000 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.109
 elimination for a death so that's it 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.000
 so I'm going to disconnect from the psn m 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:25.290
 reconnect to show you anyway 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.200
 that it works a high place of you 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.470
 say it so much you show it and for 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.959
 somehow finalized save this 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.940
 that you did go online and 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.650
 did he leave the part where 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.720
 you never want to leave the 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.920
 part you end the game as he 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.410
 at least you have to do a trick 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.850
 online so as to make a kill for 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.560
 to be able to validate what you did 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.630
 so here I go in my agent card 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.010
 combat report and you see that 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.299
 I only have a few seconds of time to 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.220
 game is the time I put to myself 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.319
 to commit suicide in the part I did in 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.060
 split screen 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.519
 died only one since I am 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.840
 to commit suicide I have a ball so here are the 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:01.249
 friends is still a very good guide 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.930
 that I propose to you today it is 

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:05.510
 very simple to make kings the 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.799
 risk of banishment by forgiveness are 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.599
 quite weak 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:10.760
 I'm not telling you they're void 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:12.349
 since there is never a chance of 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.239
 to be banned in Valais I show you 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:15.859
 that I enter a part I do 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.239
 an elimination I wanted to continue a 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:19.340
 little bit I'm going to make a comic my 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.859
 pass and unlocked hanifi once 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.000
 it's done and well you leave the game 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:26.599
 and you can go back to your 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.400
 agent card so you'll see the one or the 

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:30.139
 kills that you have done with time 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.330
 the game you made that will be 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:34.970
 added to your agent card and that's it 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.949
 so that's how to leave pretty well 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.320
 if ever your ratio is a little rotten 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:42.440
 imagine that you have 5000 elimination 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.810
 for 2500 dead well you'll have 5 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.240
 but the elimination for a moore so 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.340
 that's how to have a ratio of 5000 or 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.660
 that's a lot of shit and 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.060
 when you play his down 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.320
 naturally reassure you so here you go 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.210
 friends hope a lack slips 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.949
 you will have pleased I thank this gentleman 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.199
 glitch for discovering precisely 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:01.759
 this technique makes sense at 55 for 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:02.870
 have been kind enough to help me when 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:05.500
 I 'll see you again soon 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.500
 by everyone
