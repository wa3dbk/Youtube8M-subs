00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
and it's just you know most meta decks

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.430 
and it's just you know most meta decks
have<00:00:35.190> no<00:00:35.700> real<00:00:35.969> effective<00:00:36.690> way<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:36.930> deal<00:00:37.410> with

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
have no real effective way to deal with

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.670 
have no real effective way to deal with
you<00:00:37.770> bail<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:38.930> mean<00:00:39.930> in<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.200> past<00:00:40.379> that<00:00:40.559> be

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
you bail so I mean in the past that be

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.590 
you bail so I mean in the past that be
like<00:00:40.800> okay<00:00:41.309> whatever<00:00:41.579> I'll<00:00:41.790> just<00:00:41.820> veronic

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
like okay whatever I'll just veronic

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.279 
like okay whatever I'll just veronic
that<00:00:42.960> but<00:00:44.120> you<00:00:45.120> know<00:00:45.149> dexa<00:00:45.930> pulled<00:00:46.110> away<00:00:46.200> from

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
that but you know dexa pulled away from

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.869 
that but you know dexa pulled away from
synchros<00:00:46.770> so<00:00:47.010> they<00:00:47.190> don't<00:00:47.550> really<00:00:47.700> have<00:00:47.789> an

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
synchros so they don't really have an

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.340 
synchros so they don't really have an
effective<00:00:48.149> way<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.300> deal<00:00:48.539> with<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.809> but<00:00:49.260> I've

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
effective way to deal with it but I've

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.720 
effective way to deal with it but I've
blathered<00:00:49.649> on<00:00:49.800> enough<00:00:50.129> let's<00:00:50.340> get<00:00:50.489> into<00:00:50.610> what

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
blathered on enough let's get into what

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.910 
blathered on enough let's get into what
the<00:00:50.879> decklist<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.360> first<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.750> all<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.469> we<00:00:52.800> have

just<00:01:35.850> recursion<00:01:36.450> for<00:01:36.659> your<00:01:36.780> grave<00:01:36.990> there's

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
just recursion for your grave there's

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.260 
just recursion for your grave there's
like<00:01:38.100> half<00:01:38.280> this<00:01:38.490> deck<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.729> just<00:01:39.030> grave

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
like half this deck is just grave

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.630

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
recursion half is lo de grave up cool

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.050

the<00:03:50.820> field<00:03:51.090> it<00:03:51.900> still<00:03:52.350> gets<00:03:52.560> effect<00:03:53.010> or<00:03:53.730> if

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
the field it still gets effect or if

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.580 
the field it still gets effect or if
they<00:03:54.060> say<00:03:54.239> use<00:03:54.420> a<00:03:54.450> virus<00:03:54.900> effect<00:03:55.200> on<00:03:55.320> you<00:03:55.440> you

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
they say use a virus effect on you you

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.070 
they say use a virus effect on you you
still<00:03:55.860> get<00:03:56.010> your<00:03:56.130> effect<00:03:56.550> so<00:03:57.150> you<00:03:57.209> transform

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
still get your effect so you transform

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.050 
still get your effect so you transform
so<00:03:58.530> it's<00:03:58.950> you<00:03:59.220> don't<00:03:59.520> really<00:03:59.610> care<00:03:59.790> about<00:03:59.910> it

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
so it's you don't really care about it

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.670 
so it's you don't really care about it
too<00:04:00.209> much<00:04:00.239> it's<00:04:00.510> not<00:04:00.630> needed<00:04:00.840> and<00:04:01.080> then

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
too much it's not needed and then

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.680 
too much it's not needed and then
finally<00:04:02.070> we<00:04:02.160> have<00:04:02.310> some<00:04:02.580> recursion<00:04:03.090> recall

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
finally we have some recursion recall

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.140 
finally we have some recursion recall
three<00:04:04.170> limit<00:04:04.470> and<00:04:04.590> then<00:04:05.220> to<00:04:05.430> torrential<00:04:05.670> again

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
three limit and then to torrential again

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.870 
three limit and then to torrential again

you know popping your you bells limit

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.820 
you know popping your you bells limit
lets<00:04:09.150> you<00:04:09.239> get<00:04:09.360> back<00:04:09.570> your<00:04:09.810> you<00:04:09.959> bail<00:04:10.170> and<00:04:10.470> then

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
during your turn you can turn you bill

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.530 
during your turn you can turn you bill
to<00:04:13.170> the<00:04:13.200> defense<00:04:13.530> limit<00:04:14.310> reverse<00:04:14.550> its<00:04:15.269> effect

it's automatically destroyed and then

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.530 
it's automatically destroyed and then
you<00:04:19.620> get<00:04:19.739> a<00:04:19.769> free<00:04:20.010> transformation<00:04:20.640> call<00:04:21.330> again

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
you get a free transformation call again

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.960 
you get a free transformation call again
getting<00:04:21.900> you<00:04:21.989> your<00:04:22.020> your<00:04:22.680> you<00:04:22.979> your<00:04:23.580> you<00:04:23.760> bail

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
lot of options in the deck uh that's

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.100 
lot of options in the deck uh that's
pretty<00:04:44.940> much<00:04:45.030> it<00:04:45.090> the<00:04:45.300> main<00:04:45.420> board<00:04:45.570> is<00:04:45.840> pretty

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
back transform up there's not

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.180 
back transform up there's not
a<00:04:51.870> whole<00:04:52.020> lot<00:04:52.170> to<00:04:52.350> it<00:04:52.380> another<00:04:52.710> cool<00:04:52.860> card<00:04:53.130> you

a whole lot to it another cool card you

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.430 
a whole lot to it another cool card you
can<00:04:53.280> play<00:04:53.400> in<00:04:53.460> the<00:04:53.580> deck<00:04:53.730> I<00:04:54.540> think<00:04:55.020> it's<00:04:55.140> calls
