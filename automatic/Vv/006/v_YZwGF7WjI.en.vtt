00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
these presets you'll see that it looks

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.469 
these presets you'll see that it looks
very<00:01:28.040> different<00:01:29.040> okay<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:29.759> this<00:01:30.030> one<00:01:30.240> is

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
very different okay so this one is

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.569 
very different okay so this one is
really<00:01:30.689> thinned<00:01:31.079> out<00:01:31.320> okay<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.220> can<00:01:32.400> barely

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
really thinned out okay you can barely

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.420 
really thinned out okay you can barely
even<00:01:32.759> see<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.150> colors<00:01:33.890> if<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:34.979> click<00:01:35.189> on<00:01:35.310> the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
even see the colors if I click on the

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.999 
even see the colors if I click on the
next<00:01:35.579> one<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:36.689> can<00:01:36.840> see<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.439> starts<00:01:37.890> out

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
next one you can see it starts out

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.620 
next one you can see it starts out
pretty<00:01:38.070> wet<00:01:38.520> but<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.820> dries<00:01:39.030> up<00:01:39.270> almost

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
pretty wet but it dries up almost

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.859 
pretty wet but it dries up almost
instantly<00:01:40.880> so<00:01:41.880> there's<00:01:41.909> different<00:01:42.240> presets

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
instantly so there's different presets

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.960 
instantly so there's different presets
for<00:01:43.560> this<00:01:43.680> tool<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.520> all<00:01:44.670> do<00:01:44.820> different

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
for this tool that all do different

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.830 
for this tool that all do different
things<00:01:47.780> so<00:01:48.780> let's<00:01:49.500> say<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:50.060> you<00:01:51.060> have<00:01:51.180> found<00:01:51.390> a

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
things so let's say you you have found a

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.560 
things so let's say you you have found a
specific<00:01:52.680> setting<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:53.939> think<00:01:54.509> that

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
specific setting that you think that

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.300 
specific setting that you think that
you'll<00:01:54.750> probably<00:01:55.020> use<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.320> lot<00:01:55.649> in<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.860> future

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
you'll probably use a lot in the future

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.100 
you'll probably use a lot in the future
that's<00:01:57.060> something<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.420> you'd<00:01:57.600> want<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:57.899> save

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
that's something that you'd want to save

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.190 
that's something that you'd want to save
as<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.290> preset<00:01:58.799> for<00:01:59.189> future<00:01:59.490> use<00:01:59.700> I<00:02:00.170> happen<00:02:01.170> to

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
as a preset for future use I happen to

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.500 
as a preset for future use I happen to
have<00:02:01.290> one<00:02:01.590> which<00:02:02.040> I'm<00:02:02.189> going<00:02:02.310> to

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
have one which I'm going to

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:10.060 
have one which I'm going to
go<00:02:02.690> ahead<00:02:02.840> and<00:02:02.960> set<00:02:03.350> up<00:02:03.380> right<00:02:03.650> now<00:02:08.920> this<00:02:09.920> is

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
go ahead and set up right now this is

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.230 
go ahead and set up right now this is
one<00:02:10.280> I<00:02:10.310> use<00:02:10.580> a<00:02:10.610> lot<00:02:10.880> for<00:02:11.120> blending<00:02:13.240> without

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
one I use a lot for blending without

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.930 
one I use a lot for blending without
actually<00:02:14.660> pushing<00:02:15.050> pant<00:02:15.260> around<00:02:15.790> it's<00:02:16.790> got

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
actually pushing pant around it's got

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:25.900 
actually pushing pant around it's got
the<00:02:17.060> instant<00:02:17.360> dry<00:02:17.450> on<00:02:18.130> but<00:02:19.130> a<00:02:19.160> high<00:02:19.370> thinner<00:02:24.910> so

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
the instant dry on but a high thinner so

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.690 
the instant dry on but a high thinner so
