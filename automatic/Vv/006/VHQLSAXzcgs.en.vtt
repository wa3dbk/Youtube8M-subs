00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:04.390 
so this is a video on how to diagnose

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.780 
so this is a video on how to diagnose
and<00:00:04.629> repair<00:00:04.960> the<00:00:05.140> cruise<00:00:05.350> control<00:00:05.380> on<00:00:05.920> a<00:00:05.950> 2004

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:06.790 
and repair the cruise control on a 2004

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.589 
and repair the cruise control on a 2004
Ford<00:00:06.820> Explorer<00:00:07.450> Sport<00:00:07.480> Trac<00:00:08.640> so<00:00:09.640> the<00:00:10.360> first

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:10.599 
Ford Explorer Sport Trac so the first

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:12.629 
Ford Explorer Sport Trac so the first
thing<00:00:10.780> with<00:00:11.440> the<00:00:11.590> problem<00:00:11.860> with<00:00:11.950> my<00:00:12.099> truck<00:00:12.460> is

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:12.639 
thing with the problem with my truck is

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.060 
thing with the problem with my truck is
when<00:00:13.150> I<00:00:13.300> when<00:00:14.019> I<00:00:14.050> when<00:00:14.380> I'm<00:00:14.590> driving<00:00:14.920> on<00:00:14.950> the

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.070 
when I when I when I'm driving on the

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.169 
when I when I when I'm driving on the
highway<00:00:15.190> and<00:00:15.550> you<00:00:15.610> set<00:00:15.849> the<00:00:15.969> cruise<00:00:16.150> control

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:16.179 
highway and you set the cruise control

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:18.269 
highway and you set the cruise control
this<00:00:17.020> cruise<00:00:17.350> control<00:00:17.680> light<00:00:17.800> just<00:00:18.010> comes<00:00:18.190> on

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:18.279 
this cruise control light just comes on

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:21.599 
this cruise control light just comes on
110<00:00:18.670> turns<00:00:18.910> off<00:00:19.060> and<00:00:19.330> it<00:00:19.510> doesn't<00:00:19.779> engage<00:00:20.609> so

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:21.609 
110 turns off and it doesn't engage so

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:22.980 
110 turns off and it doesn't engage so
there<00:00:21.789> are<00:00:21.850> a<00:00:21.880> few<00:00:21.970> things<00:00:22.150> we<00:00:22.390> can<00:00:22.420> do<00:00:22.750> to

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:22.990 
there are a few things we can do to

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.910 
there are a few things we can do to
figure<00:00:23.380> out<00:00:23.470> what's<00:00:23.590> wrong<00:00:25.619> so<00:00:26.619> the<00:00:26.710> first

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:26.920 
figure out what's wrong so the first

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.140 
figure out what's wrong so the first
thing<00:00:27.070> wrong<00:00:27.220> can<00:00:27.460> be<00:00:27.490> that<00:00:27.730> maybe<00:00:27.910> these

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.150 
thing wrong can be that maybe these

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.599 
thing wrong can be that maybe these
switches<00:00:28.539> are<00:00:28.630> working<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:30.039> find<00:00:30.310> out<00:00:30.430> these

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:30.609 
switches are working to find out these

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:32.459 
switches are working to find out these
switches<00:00:30.880> are<00:00:30.970> working<00:00:31.300> well<00:00:32.109> you<00:00:32.230> can<00:00:32.349> just

00:00:32.459 --> 00:00:32.469 
switches are working well you can just

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:34.799 
switches are working well you can just
push<00:00:32.710> the<00:00:33.100> button<00:00:33.370> and<00:00:33.579> my<00:00:34.149> cases<00:00:34.510> switches

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
push the button and my cases switches

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:35.910 
push the button and my cases switches
are<00:00:34.929> working<00:00:35.289> because<00:00:35.440> the<00:00:35.710> cruise<00:00:35.889> control

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
are working because the cruise control

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.559 
are working because the cruise control
light<00:00:36.339> comes<00:00:36.519> on<00:00:36.670> even<00:00:37.089> though<00:00:37.179> it<00:00:37.269> goes<00:00:37.389> off

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:37.569 
light comes on even though it goes off

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:40.500 
light comes on even though it goes off
you<00:00:38.139> can<00:00:38.319> tell<00:00:38.499> that<00:00:38.879> this<00:00:39.879> which<00:00:40.059> is<00:00:40.210> giving

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
you can tell that this which is giving

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.149 
you can tell that this which is giving
input<00:00:40.659> so<00:00:41.409> that<00:00:41.530> means<00:00:41.739> the<00:00:41.799> switches

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:42.159 
input so that means the switches

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:45.209 
input so that means the switches
switches<00:00:42.399> are<00:00:42.760> fine<00:00:42.969> and<00:00:43.120> words<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:45.100> next

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:45.219 
switches are fine and words the next

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:47.069 
switches are fine and words the next
thing<00:00:45.489> to<00:00:45.609> check<00:00:45.760> is<00:00:45.819> maybe<00:00:46.479> the<00:00:46.719> maybe

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 
thing to check is maybe the maybe

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:48.059 
thing to check is maybe the maybe
there's<00:00:47.319> something<00:00:47.440> wrong<00:00:47.589> with<00:00:47.799> the<00:00:47.920> brake

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:48.069 
there's something wrong with the brake

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:50.279 
there's something wrong with the brake
pedal<00:00:48.370> the<00:00:48.459> brake<00:00:48.609> pedal<00:00:48.879> switch<00:00:48.940> but<00:00:49.839> on<00:00:50.019> this

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:50.289 
pedal the brake pedal switch but on this

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:53.099 
pedal the brake pedal switch but on this
truck<00:00:50.499> on<00:00:50.920> this<00:00:51.429> truck<00:00:51.670> the<00:00:51.819> brake<00:00:52.059> the<00:00:52.359> brake

00:00:53.099 --> 00:00:53.109 
truck on this truck the brake the brake

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:55.469 
truck on this truck the brake the brake
pedal<00:00:53.440> switch<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:54.670> deactivate<00:00:54.909> to<00:00:55.299> cruise

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:55.479 
pedal switch to deactivate to cruise

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:57.539 
pedal switch to deactivate to cruise
control<00:00:55.780> is<00:00:55.869> actually<00:00:56.139> in<00:00:56.199> the<00:00:56.289> engine<00:00:56.649> so<00:00:57.159> the

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:57.549 
control is actually in the engine so the

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:59.069 
control is actually in the engine so the
one<00:00:57.699> behind<00:00:58.059> the<00:00:58.119> big<00:00:58.269> personal<00:00:58.629> chair<00:00:58.869> just

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
one behind the big personal chair just

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.069 
one behind the big personal chair just
controls<00:00:59.440> the<00:00:59.559> brakes<00:00:59.769> the<00:01:00.369> brake<00:01:00.579> lights<00:01:01.079> so

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:02.079 
controls the brakes the brake lights so

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:03.389 
controls the brakes the brake lights so
then<00:01:02.229> the<00:01:02.350> next<00:01:02.589> thing<00:01:02.679> to<00:01:02.859> check<00:01:03.039> would<00:01:03.249> be

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399 
then the next thing to check would be

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:04.859 
then the next thing to check would be
the<00:01:03.519> brake<00:01:03.760> pressure<00:01:04.059> switch<00:01:04.390> locate<00:01:04.750> on<00:01:04.839> the

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
the brake pressure switch locate on the

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:07.789 
the brake pressure switch locate on the
master<00:01:05.259> cylinder<00:01:05.439> so<00:01:05.740> we'll<00:01:05.890> check<00:01:06.070> that<00:01:06.100> now

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
master cylinder so we'll check that now

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.050 
master cylinder so we'll check that now
alright<00:01:08.799> so<00:01:08.950> this<00:01:09.130> is<00:01:09.310> the<00:01:09.399> location<00:01:09.670> of<00:01:09.939> the

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
alright so this is the location of the

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.330 
alright so this is the location of the
brake<00:01:10.329> pressure<00:01:10.719> switch<00:01:11.109> pressure<00:01:11.770> switch<00:01:12.159> on

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
brake pressure switch pressure switch on

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.190 
brake pressure switch pressure switch on
the<00:01:12.490> master<00:01:12.880> cylinder<00:01:13.060> I<00:01:13.390> was<00:01:13.810> going<00:01:13.960> to<00:01:14.049> plug

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
the master cylinder I was going to plug

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:21.660 
the master cylinder I was going to plug
it<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:18.880> to<00:01:18.939> test<00:01:19.420> to<00:01:19.929> test<00:01:20.170> the<00:01:20.289> switch<00:01:20.439> we<00:01:21.250> take

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
it so to test to test the switch we take

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.700 
it so to test to test the switch we take
an<00:01:21.850> ohm<00:01:22.030> meter<00:01:22.060> and<00:01:22.570> put<00:01:22.600> it<00:01:22.990> on<00:01:23.109> the<00:01:23.259> leads<00:01:23.439> and

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
an ohm meter and put it on the leads and

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.380 
an ohm meter and put it on the leads and
once<00:01:24.070> we<00:01:24.159> put<00:01:24.340> on<00:01:24.429> the<00:01:24.520> leads<00:01:24.700> the<00:01:25.090> ohmmeter

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
once we put on the leads the ohmmeter

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.060 
once we put on the leads the ohmmeter
should<00:01:25.689> beep<00:01:25.899> to<00:01:26.200> let<00:01:26.350> us<00:01:26.409> notice<00:01:26.710> which<00:01:26.890> is

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
should beep to let us notice which is

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.010 
should beep to let us notice which is
working<00:01:27.369> if<00:01:27.759> it's<00:01:28.149> now<00:01:28.240> working<00:01:28.539> then<00:01:28.899> the

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
working if it's now working then the

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.630 
working if it's now working then the
ohmmeter<00:01:29.469> will<00:01:29.679> not<00:01:29.799> beep

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
ohmmeter will not beep

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.399 
ohmmeter will not beep
to<00:01:32.120> take<00:01:32.300> out<00:01:32.450> the<00:01:32.570> switch<00:01:32.810> we<00:01:33.110> just<00:01:33.260> use<00:01:33.380> a

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
to take out the switch we just use a

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:53.590 
to take out the switch we just use a
wrench<00:01:33.680> and<00:01:33.920> I'm<00:01:34.220> good

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.150 

but<00:01:54.600> not<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.900> test<00:01:55.170> if<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.440> switch<00:01:55.650> is<00:01:55.680> working

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
but not to test if the switch is working

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.010 
but not to test if the switch is working
we<00:01:56.460> set<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.790> ohmmeter<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.360> devoting<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:57.900> to

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
we set the ohmmeter to devoting it to

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.540 
we set the ohmmeter to devoting it to
continuity<00:02:00.470> so<00:02:01.470> now<00:02:01.650> this<00:02:01.830> so<00:02:02.160> now<00:02:02.280> when<00:02:02.460> we

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
continuity so now this so now when we

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.550 
continuity so now this so now when we
put<00:02:02.730> the<00:02:02.910> leads<00:02:03.330> on<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.600> this<00:02:03.870> on<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.410> the

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
put the leads on to this on to the

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.240 
put the leads on to this on to the
switch<00:02:05.480> they<00:02:06.480> shed<00:02:06.720> beep<00:02:06.930> -<00:02:07.380> mm<00:02:07.830> as<00:02:08.010> a<00:02:08.040> switch

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
switch they shed beep - mm as a switch

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.070 
switch they shed beep - mm as a switch
is<00:02:08.400> working<00:02:11.270> see<00:02:12.270> but<00:02:12.450> here<00:02:12.630> it<00:02:12.690> doesn't<00:02:12.840> beep

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
is working see but here it doesn't beep

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.270 
is working see but here it doesn't beep
so<00:02:13.230> this<00:02:13.380> means<00:02:13.620> that<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.800> switch<00:02:13.980> is<00:02:14.130> not

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
so this means that the switch is not

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.490 
so this means that the switch is not
working<00:02:14.640> so<00:02:15.390> now<00:02:15.420> I<00:02:15.540> test<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.930> switch<00:02:16.050> that<00:02:16.170> is

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
working so now I test the switch that is

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.650 
working so now I test the switch that is
working<00:02:16.860> at<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.160> show<00:02:17.190> you<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.460> difference

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.020 

this<00:02:21.660> is<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:21.900> new<00:02:22.230> switch<00:02:22.580> so<00:02:23.580> if<00:02:23.670> you<00:02:23.760> put<00:02:23.940> the

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
this is a new switch so if you put the

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.570 
this is a new switch so if you put the
lead<00:02:24.240> here<00:02:25.080> it<00:02:25.320> will<00:02:25.440> beep<00:02:28.100> see<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.340> beeps

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
lead here it will beep see the beeps

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.800 
lead here it will beep see the beeps
which<00:02:29.970> means<00:02:30.210> the<00:02:30.420> switch<00:02:30.750> is<00:02:30.900> working<00:02:32.780> so<00:02:33.780> now

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
which means the switch is working so now

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:53.910 
which means the switch is working so now
will<00:02:34.050> put<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.320> switch<00:02:34.500> in

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:08.570 

so<00:02:54.920> now<00:02:55.040> I<00:02:55.069> just<00:02:55.189> screw<00:02:56.030> the<00:02:56.120> new<00:02:56.239> switch<00:02:56.450> in

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:20.050 

but<00:03:09.030> ended<00:03:09.360> up

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.930 

okay<00:03:20.810> good

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
okay good

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.670 
okay good
not<00:03:22.510> to<00:03:22.810> switch<00:03:23.020> back<00:03:23.230> on<00:03:25.500> that's<00:03:26.500> how<00:03:26.590> you

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
not to switch back on that's how you

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.580 
not to switch back on that's how you
approach<00:03:26.950> the<00:03:27.070> cruise<00:03:27.250> control
