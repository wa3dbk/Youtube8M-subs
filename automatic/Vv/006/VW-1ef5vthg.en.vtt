00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:18.340
 poverty in the world but that make them 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.230
 on ships in illegal waters then 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.240

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:25.140
 knots down the street clear all then 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.140

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:50.490
 first time Carlos said Carlos not 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:52.530

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.510

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.990
 this is a problem that is that this 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.520
 Friday is the second event where we are going 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.390

 700 deadlines but there are only 600 left 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.730
 because the people who have bought 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.490
