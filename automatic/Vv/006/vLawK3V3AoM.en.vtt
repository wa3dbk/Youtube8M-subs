00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
squared the personal hard work and

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.590 
squared the personal hard work and
number<00:02:18.820> two<00:02:19.170> it's<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.320> lazy<00:02:20.560> way<00:02:20.830> out<00:02:21.010> right

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
number two it's the lazy way out right

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.270 
number two it's the lazy way out right
so<00:02:22.600> um<00:02:22.930> I<00:02:23.140> said<00:02:23.290> detective<00:02:23.680> you<00:02:23.980> know<00:02:24.070> he<00:02:24.190> was

having more abnormal

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.760 
having more abnormal
so<00:02:25.900> it<00:02:26.710> took<00:02:26.890> like<00:02:28.170> about<00:02:29.170> this<00:02:29.350> like<00:02:29.560> two

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
so it took like about this like two

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.380 
so it took like about this like two
years<00:02:30.010> at<00:02:30.670> least<00:02:30.790> two<00:02:31.030> years<00:02:31.270> now<00:02:33.030> so<00:02:34.030> now<00:02:34.120> one

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
years at least two years now so now one

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.040 
years at least two years now so now one

for<00:03:39.940> four<00:03:40.300> years<00:03:40.630> straight<00:03:40.959> right<00:03:41.560> I'm<00:03:41.680> gonna

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
for four years straight right I'm gonna

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.470 
for four years straight right I'm gonna
did<00:03:42.100> it<00:03:42.190> for<00:03:42.280> like<00:03:42.370> what<00:03:42.580> a<00:03:42.610> year<00:03:42.940> two<00:03:43.150> years<00:03:43.180> I

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
did it for like what a year two years I

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.970 
did it for like what a year two years I
think<00:03:43.630> probably<00:03:43.810> messed<00:03:44.080> in<00:03:44.230> here<00:03:44.470> you<00:03:44.739> did<00:03:44.890> it

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
think probably messed in here you did it

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.949 
think probably messed in here you did it
for<00:03:45.100> four<00:03:45.459> years<00:03:45.940> straight<00:03:46.120> that's<00:03:46.510> I'm

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
for four years straight that's I'm

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.660 
for four years straight that's I'm
assuming<00:03:47.440> he<00:03:47.500> was<00:03:47.530> legit<00:03:47.920> five<00:03:48.160> times<00:03:48.430> a<00:03:48.520> week

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
assuming he was legit five times a week

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.130 
assuming he was legit five times a week
just<00:03:48.880> because<00:03:49.480> I<00:03:49.540> think<00:03:49.600> of<00:03:49.780> you<00:03:49.840> there's<00:03:50.080> a

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
just because I think of you there's a

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.229 
just because I think of you there's a
typical<00:03:50.500> splits<00:03:50.770> so<00:03:51.400> let's<00:03:51.580> say<00:03:51.700> four<00:03:51.940> to<00:03:52.030> five

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
typical splits so let's say four to five

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:53.970 
typical splits so let's say four to five
days<00:03:52.390> out<00:03:52.570> of<00:03:52.630> the<00:03:52.720> week<00:03:52.780> right<00:03:53.080> pull-ups

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
days out of the week right pull-ups

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.130 
days out of the week right pull-ups
pull-ups<00:03:54.459> pull-ups<00:03:54.880> pull-ups<00:03:55.510> next<00:03:55.989> week

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
pull-ups pull-ups pull-ups next week

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.530 
pull-ups pull-ups pull-ups next week
pull-ups<00:03:56.650> pull-ups<00:03:57.100> put<00:03:57.430> those<00:03:57.580> books<00:03:58.000> on<00:03:58.150> and

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540
