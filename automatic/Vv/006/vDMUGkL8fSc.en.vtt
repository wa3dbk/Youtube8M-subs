00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
too sure and the base of the white ones

too sure and the base of the white ones
left<00:01:05.010> mine<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:05.220> when<00:01:05.460> I<00:01:05.489> went<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.729> work<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:06.510> if

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
left mine in when I went to work so if

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.210 
left mine in when I went to work so if
you're<00:01:06.810> planning<00:01:07.290> on<00:01:07.439> going<00:01:07.860> out<00:01:07.979> somewhere

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
you're planning on going out somewhere

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.590 
you're planning on going out somewhere
or<00:01:08.580> leaving<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:08.970> in<00:01:09.060> overnight<00:01:09.390> that's

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
or leaving it in overnight that's

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.420 
or leaving it in overnight that's
probably<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.350> best<00:01:10.560> thing<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.890> do<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.280> that's

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
probably the best thing to do and that's

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.520 
probably the best thing to do and that's
what<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.610> recommend<00:01:11.909> because<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:13.229> don't<00:01:13.409> be

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
what I recommend because you don't be

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.200 
what I recommend because you don't be
paying<00:01:13.770> silly<00:01:14.100> prices<00:01:14.400> for<00:01:14.700> things<00:01:14.909> because

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
paying silly prices for things because

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.820 
paying silly prices for things because
it<00:01:15.330> just<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.840> know<00:01:15.869> minimize<00:01:16.380> down<00:01:16.710> the

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
it just you know minimize down the

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:17.960 
it just you know minimize down the
amount<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.070> money<00:01:17.220> you're<00:01:17.280> going<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.460> make<00:01:17.520> so

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
amount of money you're going to make so

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.580 
amount of money you're going to make so
leave<00:01:18.479> min<00:01:18.689> over<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:18.960> given<00:01:19.110> amount<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.409> time

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
leave min over a given amount of time

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.929 
leave min over a given amount of time
and<00:01:19.920> they<00:01:20.009> should<00:01:20.220> buy<00:01:20.340> free<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.790> guys

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
and they should buy free of you guys

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.030 
and they should buy free of you guys
pretty<00:01:21.240> easily<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:22.290> per<00:01:22.439> bag<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:22.830> want<00:01:22.950> to

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
pretty easily so per bag you want to

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.490 
pretty easily so per bag you want to
withdraw<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.850> granite<00:01:24.180> 5<00:01:24.390> kgs<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:24.900> then<00:01:25.259> one

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
withdraw to granite 5 kgs and then one

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.530 
withdraw to granite 5 kgs and then one
granite<00:01:25.830> 2<00:01:26.009> kgs<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.759> then<00:01:27.180> when<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.330> price

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
granite 2 kgs and then when you price

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.230 
granite 2 kgs and then when you price
check<00:01:27.780> these<00:01:27.990> equals<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.530> 1.9<00:01:28.950> k<00:01:29.369> like<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.180> said

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
check these equals to 1.9 k like I said

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.730 
check these equals to 1.9 k like I said
if<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:30.750> go<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:30.990> different<00:01:31.200> route<00:01:31.470> with<00:01:31.710> the

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
if you go a different route with the

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.560 
if you go a different route with the
method<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.369> take<00:01:32.579> this<00:01:33.060> will<00:01:33.270> be<00:01:33.390> different

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
method you take this will be different

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.240 
method you take this will be different
then<00:01:33.869> we're<00:01:34.170> going<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.380> do<00:01:34.470> is<00:01:34.680> simply<00:01:35.009> click

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
then we're going to do is simply click

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.190 
then we're going to do is simply click
on<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.430> granite<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.270> whichever<00:01:36.840> one<00:01:37.020> you

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
on the granite and whichever one you

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.600 
on the granite and whichever one you
want<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.380> do<00:01:37.500> first<00:01:37.710> up<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.130> guys<00:01:38.189> if<00:01:38.430> all

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
want to do first up to you guys if all

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.100 
want to do first up to you guys if all
you<00:01:38.729> do<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:38.909> him<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.450> want<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.659> craft<00:01:39.840> them

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
you do is him you want to craft them

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.200 
you do is him you want to craft them
into<00:01:40.619> basically<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.430> have<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.579> full<00:01:41.820> invent

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
into basically so you have a full invent

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.810 
into basically so you have a full invent
full<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.630> granite<00:01:42.960> 500<00:01:43.229> GS<00:01:43.740> only<00:01:44.189> now<00:01:44.670> this

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
full of granite 500 GS only now this

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.609 
full of granite 500 GS only now this
literally<00:01:45.180> takes<00:01:45.390> under<00:01:45.630> 15<00:01:46.079> seconds<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.500> do

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
literally takes under 15 seconds to do

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.560 
literally takes under 15 seconds to do
that<00:01:46.799> you'll<00:01:46.920> see<00:01:47.070> in<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.220> video<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:48.180> think

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
that you'll see in the video I think

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.749 
that you'll see in the video I think
it's<00:01:48.720> like<00:01:48.869> 15<00:01:49.680> seconds<00:01:50.040> in<00:01:50.159> total<00:01:50.549> with

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
it's like 15 seconds in total with

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.370 
it's like 15 seconds in total with
banking<00:01:51.149> as<00:01:51.299> well<00:01:51.479> it's<00:01:51.930> really<00:01:52.140> fast

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
banking as well it's really fast

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.810 
banking as well it's really fast
especially<00:01:52.680> if<00:01:52.979> you're<00:01:53.100> like<00:01:53.220> focused<00:01:53.640> on<00:01:53.729> it

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
especially if you're like focused on it

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.550 
especially if you're like focused on it
and<00:01:53.939> stuff<00:01:54.000> like<00:01:54.180> that<00:01:54.240> so<00:01:54.720> in<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.020> time<00:01:55.350> if

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
and stuff like that so in that time if

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.410 
and stuff like that so in that time if
we<00:01:55.740> price<00:01:55.950> check<00:01:56.219> now<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.460> new<00:01:56.790> items<00:01:57.149> which

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
we price check now the new items which

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.109 
we price check now the new items which
is<00:01:57.570> obviously<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.869> granite<00:01:58.200> 500<00:01:58.439> GS

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
is obviously the granite 500 GS

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.100 
is obviously the granite 500 GS
basically<00:02:00.119> you<00:02:00.360> can<00:02:00.479> see<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.689> is<00:02:00.780> now<00:02:00.899> worth

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
basically you can see that is now worth

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.730 
basically you can see that is now worth
6.8<00:02:01.710> k<00:02:01.920> so<00:02:02.430> that's<00:02:02.579> 4.9<00:02:03.210> k<00:02:03.420> profit<00:02:03.810> in<00:02:03.960> just<00:02:04.350> 15

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
6.8 k so that's 4.9 k profit in just 15

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.800 
6.8 k so that's 4.9 k profit in just 15
seconds<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.520> if<00:02:05.909> you<00:02:06.000> do<00:02:06.090> all<00:02:06.270> wagons<00:02:06.659> out

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
seconds and if you do all wagons out

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.779 
seconds and if you do all wagons out
this<00:02:07.020> actually<00:02:07.320> ends<00:02:07.560> up<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.799> be<00:02:07.890> between<00:02:08.099> 1.1

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
this actually ends up to be between 1.1

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.119 
this actually ends up to be between 1.1
and<00:02:09.000> 1.2<00:02:09.060> mil<00:02:09.840> per<00:02:10.050> hour<00:02:10.259> so<00:02:10.830> it's<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:10.950> really

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
and 1.2 mil per hour so it's a really

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.890 
and 1.2 mil per hour so it's a really
easy<00:02:11.220> method<00:02:11.879> of<00:02:11.970> making<00:02:12.090> money<00:02:12.330> it's<00:02:12.629> fast

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
easy method of making money it's fast

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.680 
easy method of making money it's fast
