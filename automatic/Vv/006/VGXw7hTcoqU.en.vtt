become involved in movi directional
movements<00:00:43.880> you<00:00:44.880> know<00:00:44.970> it's<00:00:45.150> not<00:00:45.270> just<00:00:45.330> a

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
movements you know it's not just a

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.940 
movements you know it's not just a
static<00:00:45.809> hold<00:00:46.020> stretch<00:00:46.559> but<00:00:46.770> there's<00:00:46.830> a

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
static hold stretch but there's a

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.850 
static hold stretch but there's a
dynamic<00:00:47.400> movement<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:47.820> comes<00:00:48.030> with<00:00:48.239> that

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
dynamic movement that comes with that

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.520 
dynamic movement that comes with that
that's<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:50.040> asides<00:00:50.370> where's<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:51.530> squat

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
that's it asides where's that squat

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.430 
that's it asides where's that squat
through<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:53.870> forward<00:00:54.870> lunge

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
through that forward lunge

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.790 
through that forward lunge
yes<00:00:56.010> Reiki<00:00:56.490> the<00:00:56.579> chest<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:57.000> dip<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.840> in<00:00:57.990> drive<00:00:58.650> it

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
yes Reiki the chest I dip it in drive it

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.130 
yes Reiki the chest I dip it in drive it
back<00:00:59.010> so<00:00:59.850> it's<00:01:00.180> moving<00:01:00.570> through<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.930> range

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
back so it's moving through the range

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.540 
back so it's moving through the range
and<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.380> controlled<00:01:01.829> movement<00:01:02.280> through<00:01:02.460> the

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
and a controlled movement through the

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.130 
and a controlled movement through the
range<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.910> think<00:01:03.090> that's<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.390> idea<00:01:03.750> really<00:01:03.960> of

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
range I think that's the idea really of

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.719 
range I think that's the idea really of
you<00:01:04.470> know<00:01:04.559> preparing<00:01:05.190> and<00:01:05.339> getting<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.580> body

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
you know preparing and getting the body

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.770 
you know preparing and getting the body
ready

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.050 

we<00:01:09.780> like<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:09.960> integrate<00:01:10.259> the<00:01:10.590> spark<00:01:11.369> work<00:01:11.640> into

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
we like to integrate the spark work into

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.380 
we like to integrate the spark work into
every<00:01:12.420> single<00:01:12.690> session<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.800> key<00:01:14.009> criteria

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
every single session the key criteria

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.430 
every single session the key criteria
differentiates<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.479> top<00:01:15.660> players<00:01:15.930> from<00:01:16.259> the

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
differentiates the top players from the

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.469 
differentiates the top players from the
amateurs<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:17.190> quickness<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.759> fee<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.360> you're

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
amateurs is quickness of fee so you're

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.880 
amateurs is quickness of fee so you're
loading<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:18.899> up<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.440> then<00:01:19.619> it's<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.770> little

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
loading it up and then it's a little

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.999 
loading it up and then it's a little
acceleration<00:01:20.640> through<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.000> red<00:01:21.770> nice<00:01:22.770> quick

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
acceleration through the red nice quick

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.560 
acceleration through the red nice quick
feet<00:01:23.220> shift<00:01:23.490> did<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.729> shift<00:01:23.880> in<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.149> quick<00:01:24.420> feet

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
feet shift did it shift in it quick feet

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.540 
feet shift did it shift in it quick feet
good<00:01:24.780> good<00:01:24.960> good<00:01:25.140> footwork<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:26.009> quite<00:01:26.250> narrow

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
good good good footwork is quite narrow

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.390 
good good good footwork is quite narrow
and<00:01:26.700> small<00:01:27.509> build<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.170> range<00:01:28.440> up<00:01:28.710> will<00:01:29.190> do

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
and small build that range up will do

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.310 
and small build that range up will do
runs<00:01:29.610> inshore<00:01:30.000> areas<00:01:30.180> short<00:01:30.720> bursts<00:01:30.930> of<00:01:31.140> 5

obviously<00:01:34.320> during<00:01:34.680> soccer<00:01:35.010> there's<00:01:35.580> a<00:01:35.610> lot<00:01:35.760> of

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
obviously during soccer there's a lot of

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.580 
obviously during soccer there's a lot of
jumping<00:01:36.120> involved<00:01:36.540> it's<00:01:36.750> not<00:01:36.900> necessarily

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
jumping involved it's not necessarily

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.050 
jumping involved it's not necessarily
absorbing<00:01:38.010> a<00:01:38.070> force<00:01:38.280> on<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.490> way<00:01:38.610> down<00:01:38.850> but

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
absorbing a force on the way down but

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.100 
absorbing a force on the way down but
the<00:01:39.120> thing<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.330> you've<00:01:39.570> got<00:01:39.690> to<00:01:39.780> get<00:01:39.869> down<00:01:40.080> on

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
the thing is you've got to get down on

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.649 
the thing is you've got to get down on
power<00:01:40.470> off<00:01:40.619> again<00:01:40.920> she<00:01:41.640> fried<00:01:41.909> up<00:01:42.150> shifflett

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
power off again she fried up shifflett

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.850 
power off again she fried up shifflett
well<00:01:43.049> Annie's<00:01:43.500> good<00:01:44.570> last<00:01:45.570> exercise<00:01:46.110> side<00:01:46.650> up

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
well Annie's good last exercise side up

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.219 
well Annie's good last exercise side up
is<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.460> quickness<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.940> that<00:01:48.119> reaction<00:01:48.450> that's

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
is the quickness of that reaction that's

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.990 
is the quickness of that reaction that's
the<00:01:49.320> key<00:01:49.500> factor<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.460> just<00:01:50.610> working<00:01:50.790> your

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
the key factor you just working your

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.700 
the key factor you just working your
feet<00:01:51.180> real<00:01:51.390> high<00:01:51.659> knees<00:01:51.900> side<00:01:52.170> up<00:01:52.350> very<00:01:52.860> good

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.260 

well<00:01:58.710> preseason<00:01:59.159> really<00:01:59.549> is<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.909> gives<00:02:00.150> you

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
well preseason really is it gives you

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.960 
well preseason really is it gives you
the<00:02:00.390> base<00:02:01.130> obviously<00:02:02.130> do<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.700> dynamic

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
the base obviously do a dynamic

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.429 
the base obviously do a dynamic
flexibility<00:02:03.930> warmup

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
flexibility warmup

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.859 
flexibility warmup
so<00:02:04.530> it's<00:02:04.650> a<00:02:04.710> question<00:02:05.040> of<00:02:05.159> just<00:02:05.460> getting<00:02:05.640> the

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
so it's a question of just getting the

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.090 
so it's a question of just getting the
neuromuscular<00:02:06.869> system<00:02:07.049> fired<00:02:07.470> up<00:02:07.650> then

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
neuromuscular system fired up then

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.350 
neuromuscular system fired up then
they'll<00:02:08.220> be<00:02:08.310> involved<00:02:08.429> with<00:02:08.759> footwork<00:02:09.149> then

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
they'll be involved with footwork then

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.669 
they'll be involved with footwork then
we're<00:02:09.479> going<00:02:09.600> to<00:02:09.660> bring<00:02:09.840> these<00:02:09.959> into<00:02:10.500> play

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
we're going to bring these into play

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.440 
we're going to bring these into play
very<00:02:10.709> quickly<00:02:11.160> get<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.610> feel<00:02:11.880> for<00:02:11.910> that<00:02:12.180> ball

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
very quickly get a feel for that ball

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.060 
very quickly get a feel for that ball
they've<00:02:12.750> got<00:02:12.959> to<00:02:13.080> feel<00:02:13.230> confident<00:02:13.769> with<00:02:13.950> the

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
they've got to feel confident with the

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.920 
they've got to feel confident with the
ball<00:02:14.250> are<00:02:14.670> we<00:02:14.790> going<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.030> salt<00:02:15.239> our<00:02:15.480> favorite

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
ball are we going to salt our favorite

look intensity in quality and that's the

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:28.970 
look intensity in quality and that's the
thing<00:05:27.600> you<00:05:27.690> aim<00:05:27.810> for<00:05:27.840> if<00:05:28.140> you<00:05:28.230> got<00:05:28.380> that<00:05:28.590> you

probably end up with a good session we

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.910 
probably end up with a good session we
really<00:05:33.660> need<00:05:33.810> to<00:05:33.900> ensure<00:05:34.200> that<00:05:34.230> the<00:05:34.470> guys<00:05:34.650> are

sure that they've been exposed to high
intensity<00:05:39.000> high<00:05:39.120> quality<00:05:39.600> running<00:05:42.200> there's

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:43.200 
intensity high quality running there's

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.220 
intensity high quality running there's
no<00:05:43.230> shortcut<00:05:44.100> ever<00:05:44.310> for<00:05:44.520> war<00:05:44.870> the<00:05:45.870> be-all<00:05:46.200> and
