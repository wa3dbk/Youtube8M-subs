00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
the front you can see this here is the

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:21.880 
the front you can see this here is the
kingpin<00:02:17.810> shallow<00:02:18.810> water<00:02:19.050> anchor<00:02:19.350> system<00:02:20.690> as

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
kingpin shallow water anchor system as

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.310 
kingpin shallow water anchor system as
you<00:02:22.890> can<00:02:23.040> see<00:02:23.250> it<00:02:23.610> is<00:02:23.790> detachable<00:02:24.450> and<00:02:24.630> I<00:02:25.200> was

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
you can see it is detachable and I was

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.690 
you can see it is detachable and I was

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
able to get bolts nuts and bolts to this

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.260 
able to get bolts nuts and bolts to this
so<00:02:29.910> it's<00:02:30.360> real<00:02:30.630> strong<00:02:31.020> it's<00:02:31.290> steady<00:02:32.270> added
