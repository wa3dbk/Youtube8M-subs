fall below one percent meaning you'd

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.180 
fall below one percent meaning you'd
have<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.870> write<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.079> letter<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.649> Chancellor

have to write a letter to the Chancellor
explaining<00:00:51.000> why<00:00:51.180> they'd<00:00:51.480> fallen<00:00:51.780> below<00:00:52.020> the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
explaining why they'd fallen below the

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.860 
explaining why they'd fallen below the
lower<00:00:52.430> threshold<00:00:53.430> for<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.390> Bank<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.719> England

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
lower threshold for the Bank of England

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.990 
lower threshold for the Bank of England
and<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.649> inflation<00:00:56.250> then<00:00:56.370> wouldn't<00:00:56.610> rise<00:00:56.789> to

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
and that inflation then wouldn't rise to

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.750 
and that inflation then wouldn't rise to
two<00:00:57.180> percent<00:00:57.390> again<00:00:57.750> for<00:00:57.899> three<00:00:58.050> years<00:00:58.379> so

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
two percent again for three years so

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.279 
two percent again for three years so
automatically<00:00:59.760> people<00:01:00.180> start<00:01:00.480> thinking<00:01:00.960> well

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
automatically people start thinking well

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.779 
automatically people start thinking well
maybe<00:01:01.620> these<00:01:02.070> minutes<00:01:02.460> are<00:01:02.550> going<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.730> be

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
maybe these minutes are going to be

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.299 
maybe these minutes are going to be
quite<00:01:03.059> dovish<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.750> maybe<00:01:03.989> we<00:01:04.589> could<00:01:04.830> even<00:01:04.860> see

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
quite dovish and maybe we could even see

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.130 
quite dovish and maybe we could even see
one<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.909> two<00:01:06.210> voters<00:01:06.630> if<00:01:06.750> not<00:01:06.930> both<00:01:07.080> of

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
one of the two voters if not both of

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.710 
one of the two voters if not both of
these<00:01:07.470> Otis<00:01:07.920> despite<00:01:08.610> being<00:01:08.850> very<00:01:09.330> well<00:01:09.510> known

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
these Otis despite being very well known

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.780 
these Otis despite being very well known
Hawks<00:01:10.020> actually<00:01:10.770> vote<00:01:10.920> for<00:01:11.100> no<00:01:11.220> right<00:01:11.430> because

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
Hawks actually vote for no right because

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.880 
Hawks actually vote for no right because
if<00:01:11.880> inflation<00:01:12.450> expectations<00:01:13.350> are<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:13.860> low

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
if inflation expectations are so low

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.249 
if inflation expectations are so low
then<00:01:14.580> how<00:01:14.760> can<00:01:14.820> we<00:01:15.090> be<00:01:15.390> seriously<00:01:15.810> discussing

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
then how can we be seriously discussing

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.140 
then how can we be seriously discussing
hiking<00:01:16.799> interest<00:01:17.070> rates<00:01:17.340> but<00:01:17.490> then<00:01:17.670> the

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
hiking interest rates but then the

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.550 
hiking interest rates but then the
minutes<00:01:18.450> come<00:01:18.659> out<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.140> they're<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.350> little

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
minutes come out and they're a little

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.810 
minutes come out and they're a little
bit<00:01:19.710> more<00:01:19.830> hawkish<00:01:20.100> than<00:01:20.400> we<00:01:20.670> were<00:01:20.759> expecting

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
bit more hawkish than we were expecting

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.120 
bit more hawkish than we were expecting
in<00:01:21.479> both<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.780> commentary<00:01:22.290> but<00:01:22.619> also<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.950> fact

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
in both the commentary but also the fact

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.130 
in both the commentary but also the fact
that<00:01:23.220> these<00:01:23.369> two<00:01:23.640> voters<00:01:24.060> remained<00:01:24.420> in<00:01:24.689> favor

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
that these two voters remained in favor

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.719 
that these two voters remained in favor
of<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.619> hike<00:01:25.830> so<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.070> think<00:01:26.130> we're<00:01:26.340> getting<00:01:26.430> mixed

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
of a hike so I think we're getting mixed

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.010 
of a hike so I think we're getting mixed
messages<00:01:26.790> from<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.390> Bank<00:01:27.540> of<00:01:27.630> England<00:01:27.720> right

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
messages from the Bank of England right

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.899 
messages from the Bank of England right
now<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.409> think<00:01:28.590> this<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.829> going<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.790> be<00:01:29.880> a

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
now and I think this is going to be a

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.370 
now and I think this is going to be a
bit<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.180> concern<00:01:30.479> for<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.750> markets<00:01:31.140> because

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
bit of a concern for the markets because

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.050 
bit of a concern for the markets because
it's<00:01:31.530> something<00:01:31.740> which<00:01:32.340> we<00:01:32.729> seem<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.030> have

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
it's something which we seem to have

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.910 
it's something which we seem to have
moved<00:01:33.329> away<00:01:33.450> from<00:01:33.600> in<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.020> past<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.500> certain

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
moved away from in the past to a certain

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.740 
moved away from in the past to a certain
extent<00:01:35.220> with<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.759> central<00:01:36.150> bank's<00:01:36.390> wanting

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
extent with the central bank's wanting

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.510 
extent with the central bank's wanting
to<00:01:36.840> be<00:01:36.960> more<00:01:37.110> transparent<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.950> more<00:01:38.040> clear<00:01:38.490> in

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
to be more transparent and more clear in

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.550 
to be more transparent and more clear in
their<00:01:38.850> messaging<00:01:39.360> they<00:01:39.600> want<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.869> avoid<00:01:40.110> all

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
potential inflation pressure what do you

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.740 
potential inflation pressure what do you
think<00:01:56.850> are<00:01:56.939> contributing<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.659> these

think are contributing to these

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.929 
think are contributing to these
pressures<00:01:58.259> well<00:01:59.070> again<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.369> think<00:01:59.490> this<00:01:59.759> was

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
pressures well again I think this was

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.969 
pressures well again I think this was
quite<00:02:00.450> surprising<00:02:01.140> for<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.320> markets<00:02:01.740> just

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
quite surprising for the markets just

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.670 
quite surprising for the markets just
simply<00:02:02.280> because<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:03.439> expectations<00:02:04.439> that

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
simply because of the expectations that

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.530 
simply because of the expectations that
Mark<00:02:05.369> Carney<00:02:05.640> had<00:02:05.729> talked<00:02:05.939> about<00:02:06.180> last<00:02:06.360> week

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
Mark Carney had talked about last week

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.809 
Mark Carney had talked about last week
but<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.200> think<00:02:07.259> it's<00:02:07.649> also<00:02:07.829> understandable<00:02:08.580> to

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
but I think it's also understandable to

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.150 
but I think it's also understandable to
an<00:02:08.879> extent<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.420> have<00:02:09.660> these<00:02:09.929> two<00:02:10.739> have<00:02:10.920> these

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
an extent to have these two have these

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.260 
an extent to have these two have these
risks<00:02:11.700> associated

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
risks associated

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.120 
risks associated
with<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:13.600> inflation<00:02:14.140> to<00:02:14.350> the<00:02:14.440> upside<00:02:14.710> as<00:02:14.920> well

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
with the inflation to the upside as well

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.040 
with the inflation to the upside as well
there's<00:02:15.610> always<00:02:16.120> there's<00:02:16.480> always<00:02:16.600> two<00:02:16.900> sides

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
there's always there's always two sides

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.140 
there's always there's always two sides
to<00:02:17.230> a<00:02:17.350> coin<00:02:17.380> and<00:02:17.620> there's<00:02:18.250> when<00:02:18.640> you<00:02:18.760> take<00:02:18.940> when

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
to a coin and there's when you take when

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.460 
to a coin and there's when you take when
you're<00:02:19.240> talking<00:02:19.570> about<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:19.810> risks<00:02:20.110> of<00:02:20.260> the

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
you're talking about the risks of the

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.440 
you're talking about the risks of the
this<00:02:20.740> inflation<00:02:21.190> in<00:02:21.490> the<00:02:21.520> economy<00:02:21.640> there<00:02:22.300> is

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
this inflation in the economy there is

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.750 
this inflation in the economy there is
always<00:02:23.020> going<00:02:23.110> to<00:02:23.200> be<00:02:23.290> risks<00:02:23.950> of<00:02:24.130> inflation

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
always going to be risks of inflation

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.760 
always going to be risks of inflation
rising<00:02:25.180> as<00:02:25.300> well<00:02:25.480> and<00:02:25.660> I<00:02:25.720> think<00:02:25.900> this<00:02:25.990> is<00:02:26.170> going

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
rising as well and I think this is going

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.500 
rising as well and I think this is going
to<00:02:26.830> be<00:02:26.950> focused<00:02:27.400> around<00:02:27.490> this<00:02:27.790> title<00:02:28.330> labour

beam full employment this is when you

it's when you start SI unit labor costs

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
at this stage that we start seeing more

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
wage growth and this is what we've

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.000 
wage growth and this is what we've
waited<00:02:55.090> so<00:02:55.690> long<00:02:55.930> for<00:02:55.960> in<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:56.530> economy<00:02:56.920> and

waited so long for in the economy and

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.250 
waited so long for in the economy and
it's<00:02:57.130> this<00:02:57.340> increase<00:02:58.240> in<00:02:58.390> wage<00:02:58.600> growth<00:02:58.900> and

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
it's this increase in wage growth and

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.320 
it's this increase in wage growth and
especially<00:02:59.740> when<00:03:00.010> it<00:03:00.130> then<00:03:00.250> overcomes<00:03:01.120> the

retail sales out tomorrow what are you
hoping<00:03:36.370> to<00:03:36.550> see<00:03:36.640> from<00:03:36.970> these<00:03:37.090> results<00:03:37.570> well<00:03:38.110> I

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
hoping to see from these results well I

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.750 
hoping to see from these results well I
think<00:03:38.260> what<00:03:38.500> we<00:03:38.800> want<00:03:39.010> to<00:03:39.100> see<00:03:39.220> from<00:03:39.430> all<00:03:39.610> the

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
think what we want to see from all the

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.199 
think what we want to see from all the
UK<00:03:40.480> economic<00:03:41.080> data<00:03:41.470> right<00:03:41.800> now<00:03:42.040> is<00:03:42.250> just<00:03:42.280> at

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
UK economic data right now is just at

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:44.580 
UK economic data right now is just at
the<00:03:43.300> very<00:03:43.330> least<00:03:43.690> some<00:03:43.959> form<00:03:44.170> of<00:03:44.290> stability

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
the very least some form of stability

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.350 
the very least some form of stability
because<00:03:45.040> we've<00:03:45.310> seen<00:03:45.550> so<00:03:45.730> much<00:03:45.940> improvement

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
because we've seen so much improvement

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.470 
because we've seen so much improvement
over<00:03:46.690> the<00:03:46.750> last<00:03:47.020> 12<00:03:47.860> to<00:03:48.040> 18<00:03:48.400> months<00:03:48.550> we<00:03:49.330> are

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
over the last 12 to 18 months we are

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.180 
over the last 12 to 18 months we are
seeing<00:03:49.750> an<00:03:49.900> economy<00:03:50.320> now<00:03:50.440> which<00:03:50.650> is<00:03:50.680> very<00:03:51.010> much

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
seeing an economy now which is very much

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.030 
seeing an economy now which is very much
on<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.459> men<00:03:51.760> and<00:03:52.000> we<00:03:52.630> we've<00:03:53.200> seen<00:03:53.470> we've<00:03:53.770> seen

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
on the men and we we've seen we've seen

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.230 
on the men and we we've seen we've seen
some<00:03:54.250> what<00:03:54.370> we've<00:03:54.490> seen<00:03:54.640> is<00:03:54.760> good<00:03:54.940> growth

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.240 
some what we've seen is good growth

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.490 
some what we've seen is good growth
figures<00:03:55.510> we've<00:03:55.840> seen<00:03:56.020> falling<00:03:56.290> unemployment

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
figures we've seen falling unemployment

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.180 
figures we've seen falling unemployment
we've<00:03:57.370> seen<00:03:57.580> quite<00:03:58.150> a<00:03:58.270> spread<00:03:59.190> economic

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
we've seen quite a spread economic

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.470 
we've seen quite a spread economic
recovery<00:04:00.550> as<00:04:00.610> well<00:04:00.640> across<00:04:01.000> all<00:04:01.300> different

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
recovery as well across all different

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.180 
recovery as well across all different
sectors<00:04:02.080> so<00:04:02.260> I<00:04:02.410> think<00:04:02.770> we've<00:04:02.890> got<00:04:03.010> to<00:04:03.130> be

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
sectors so I think we've got to be

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.160 
sectors so I think we've got to be
pleased<00:04:03.459> with<00:04:03.640> what<00:04:03.820> we've<00:04:04.000> seen<00:04:04.270> but<00:04:04.540> the

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
pleased with what we've seen but the

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.260 
pleased with what we've seen but the
consumer<00:04:05.740> is<00:04:05.950> so<00:04:06.190> important<00:04:06.760> to<00:04:06.850> the<00:04:06.940> UK

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.270 
consumer is so important to the UK

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.360 
consumer is so important to the UK
economy<00:04:07.360> and<00:04:07.990> consumer<00:04:08.590> spending<00:04:08.980> makes<00:04:09.160> over

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
economy and consumer spending makes over

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.970 
economy and consumer spending makes over
around<00:04:09.489> two<00:04:09.700> thirds<00:04:09.910> of<00:04:10.090> a<00:04:10.270> UK<00:04:11.020> total<00:04:11.800> output

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
around two thirds of a UK total output

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.280 
around two thirds of a UK total output
so<00:04:12.430> things<00:04:13.150> like<00:04:13.270> retail<00:04:13.660> sales<00:04:13.900> figures<00:04:14.200> are

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
so things like retail sales figures are

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.170 
so things like retail sales figures are
extremely<00:04:14.800> important<00:04:15.340> to<00:04:15.489> the<00:04:15.790> UK<00:04:16.090> economy

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
extremely important to the UK economy

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.610 
extremely important to the UK economy
and<00:04:16.540> therefore<00:04:16.630> at<00:04:16.989> the<00:04:17.049> very<00:04:17.230> least<00:04:17.410> we<00:04:17.590> need

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
and therefore at the very least we need

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.770 
and therefore at the very least we need
to<00:04:17.830> see<00:04:17.950> these<00:04:18.100> stabilizing<00:04:18.940> and<00:04:19.060> this<00:04:19.630> is

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
to see these stabilizing and this is

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.840 
to see these stabilizing and this is
what<00:04:19.989> we're<00:04:20.169> expecting<00:04:20.470> for<00:04:20.859> tomorrow<00:04:21.160> we're

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
what we're expecting for tomorrow we're

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.960 
what we're expecting for tomorrow we're
forecasting<00:04:22.740> 3.87<00:04:23.740> a<00:04:23.860> year-on-year<00:04:24.370> reads

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
forecasting 3.87 a year-on-year reads

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.670 
forecasting 3.87 a year-on-year reads
increase<00:04:25.419> in<00:04:25.570> retail<00:04:25.990> sales<00:04:26.200> which<00:04:26.440> i<00:04:26.560> think

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
increase in retail sales which i think

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.150 
increase in retail sales which i think
is

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
is

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.130 
is
quite<00:04:27.490> strong<00:04:27.760> we<00:04:27.880> have<00:04:28.030> slight<00:04:28.720> pull<00:04:28.960> back

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
quite strong we have slight pull back

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.690 
quite strong we have slight pull back
over<00:04:29.380> the<00:04:29.470> last<00:04:29.500> few<00:04:29.800> months<00:04:29.860> but<00:04:30.370> I<00:04:30.430> think<00:04:30.640> a

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
over the last few months but I think a

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.180 
over the last few months but I think a
3.87<00:04:31.450> figure<00:04:31.690> will<00:04:32.230> show<00:04:32.500> that<00:04:32.740> we're<00:04:32.860> silent

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
3.87 figure will show that we're silent

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.920 
3.87 figure will show that we're silent
see<00:04:33.370> some<00:04:33.550> stability<00:04:33.790> in<00:04:34.120> these<00:04:34.330> retail<00:04:34.660> sales

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
see some stability in these retail sales

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.200 
see some stability in these retail sales
this<00:04:35.080> constant<00:04:35.680> growth<00:04:36.430> these<00:04:36.820> type<00:04:37.180> of

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
this constant growth these type of

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.040 
this constant growth these type of
levels<00:04:37.630> which<00:04:37.750> are<00:04:39.570> consistent<00:04:40.570> with<00:04:40.600> seeing

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
levels which are consistent with seeing

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.870 
levels which are consistent with seeing
to<00:04:41.770> two-and-a-half<00:04:42.190> to<00:04:42.460> three<00:04:42.670> percent

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
to two-and-a-half to three percent

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.540 
to two-and-a-half to three percent
growth<00:04:43.270> in<00:04:44.020> the<00:04:44.260> economy<00:04:44.290> but<00:04:45.040> also<00:04:45.130> we've<00:04:45.430> got

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
growth in the economy but also we've got

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:46.620 
growth in the economy but also we've got
to<00:04:45.640> remember<00:04:45.850> as<00:04:46.090> well<00:04:46.210> we're<00:04:46.390> approaching

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
to remember as well we're approaching

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.660 
to remember as well we're approaching
the<00:04:47.050> holiday<00:04:47.680> periods<00:04:48.160> in<00:04:48.220> the<00:04:48.310> Holiday<00:04:48.640> Inn

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:48.670 
the holiday periods in the Holiday Inn

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.420 
the holiday periods in the Holiday Inn
period<00:04:49.150> is<00:04:49.270> so<00:04:49.990> important<00:04:50.890> to<00:04:50.980> an<00:04:51.220> economy

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
period is so important to an economy

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.940 
period is so important to an economy
like<00:04:51.700> the<00:04:51.820> UK<00:04:52.150> we<00:04:52.510> need<00:04:52.720> see<00:04:52.990> strong<00:04:53.560> consumer

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
like the UK we need see strong consumer

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.340 
like the UK we need see strong consumer
sentiment<00:04:54.490> we<00:04:54.610> need<00:04:54.730> seek<00:04:54.940> song<00:04:55.350> strong

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
sentiment we need seek song strong

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.890 
sentiment we need seek song strong
consumer<00:04:56.590> spending<00:04:57.250> in<00:04:57.820> order<00:04:58.120> to<00:04:58.300> really

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
consumer spending in order to really

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.510
