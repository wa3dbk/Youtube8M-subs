00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
hi this is Tekin teen driver Lucas

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.240 
hi this is Tekin teen driver Lucas
Sanford<00:00:07.080> and<00:00:07.319> today<00:00:07.830> I'm<00:00:07.950> going<00:00:08.100> to<00:00:08.160> be

Sanford and today I'm going to be

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.730 
Sanford and today I'm going to be
talking<00:00:08.460> a<00:00:08.639> little<00:00:08.730> bit<00:00:08.880> about<00:00:08.969> the<00:00:09.660> Tekin<00:00:10.230> RXH

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
talking a little bit about the Tekin RXH

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.390 
talking a little bit about the Tekin RXH
into<00:00:11.250> ESC<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:12.120> also<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.110> t8i<00:00:13.650> indoor

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
into ESC and also the t8i indoor

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.370 
into ESC and also the t8i indoor
electric<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.970> scale<00:00:15.240> motor<00:00:15.450> so<00:00:16.020> let's<00:00:16.200> have<00:00:16.320> a

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:16.380 
electric a scale motor so let's have a

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:22.159 
electric a scale motor so let's have a
look<00:00:16.590> under<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:17.099> body<00:00:20.540> so<00:00:21.540> once<00:00:21.810> we<00:00:21.930> have<00:00:22.050> the

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:22.169 
look under the body so once we have the

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:24.019 
look under the body so once we have the
body<00:00:22.380> off<00:00:22.619> you<00:00:22.919> can<00:00:23.099> already<00:00:23.279> see<00:00:23.550> some<00:00:23.579> of<00:00:23.970> the

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
body off you can already see some of the

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.359 
body off you can already see some of the
new<00:00:24.149> features<00:00:24.360> the<00:00:24.989> Gen<00:00:25.380> 2<00:00:25.590> V<00:00:25.770> is<00:00:25.890> he<00:00:26.070> comes

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
new features the Gen 2 V is he comes

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.540 
new features the Gen 2 V is he comes
with<00:00:26.610> a<00:00:26.640> white<00:00:26.910> case<00:00:27.439> also<00:00:28.439> some<00:00:28.890> white<00:00:29.070> wiring

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
with a white case also some white wiring

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.190 
with a white case also some white wiring
if<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:30.000> want<00:00:30.180> your<00:00:30.300> wiring<00:00:30.540> to<00:00:30.809> match<00:00:31.020> your

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:31.200 
if you want your wiring to match your

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.950 
if you want your wiring to match your
case<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:32.250> also<00:00:32.369> comes<00:00:32.730> with<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.940> high<00:00:33.180> voltage<00:00:33.420> B

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
case it also comes with a high voltage B

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.340 
case it also comes with a high voltage B
EC<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:35.340> BC<00:00:35.880> goes<00:00:36.059> all<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.239> way<00:00:36.329> up<00:00:36.539> to<00:00:36.719> 7<00:00:37.140> point

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
EC the BC goes all the way up to 7 point

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.189 
EC the BC goes all the way up to 7 point
4<00:00:37.590> volts<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.640> old<00:00:38.789> ESC<00:00:39.239> was<00:00:39.600> only<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.899> 6

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199 
4 volts and the old ESC was only a 6

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:43.849 
4 volts and the old ESC was only a 6
volt<00:00:40.260> BC<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.160> on<00:00:41.550> this<00:00:42.149> new<00:00:42.390> gen<00:00:43.019> 2<00:00:43.199> AC<00:00:43.649> you<00:00:43.829> can

00:00:43.849 --> 00:00:43.859 
volt BC so on this new gen 2 AC you can

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:47.180 
volt BC so on this new gen 2 AC you can
either<00:00:44.129> run<00:00:44.339> 6<00:00:44.699> volts<00:00:45.030> or<00:00:45.170> 7.4<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.829> if<00:00:47.129> you

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
either run 6 volts or 7.4 and if you

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.979 
either run 6 volts or 7.4 and if you
choose<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.429> run<00:00:47.699> a<00:00:47.730> 7.4<00:00:48.539> that's<00:00:48.780> kind<00:00:48.960> of

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
choose to run a 7.4 that's kind of

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.500 
choose to run a 7.4 that's kind of
results<00:00:49.379> in<00:00:49.530> more<00:00:50.219> speed<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.789> more<00:00:50.879> torque

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
results in more speed and more torque

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.349 
results in more speed and more torque
for<00:00:51.719> your<00:00:51.839> steering<00:00:52.109> servo<00:00:52.940> so<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.059> just<00:00:54.239> all

00:00:54.349 --> 00:00:54.359 
for your steering servo so it just all

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:55.939 
for your steering servo so it just all
depends<00:00:54.719> on<00:00:54.870> what<00:00:55.109> kind<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.350> circle<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.769> have

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
depends on what kind of circle you have

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.680 
depends on what kind of circle you have
if<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.339> want<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.579> run<00:00:56.699> 6<00:00:56.999> volts<00:00:57.359> or<00:00:57.480> if<00:00:57.570> you

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
if you want to run 6 volts or if you

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.489 
if you want to run 6 volts or if you
want<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:57.929> run<00:00:58.050> 7.4<00:00:58.859> also<00:00:59.820> the<00:01:00.570> new<00:01:00.719> t8i<00:01:01.199> motor

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:01.499 
want to run 7.4 also the new t8i motor

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:03.739 
want to run 7.4 also the new t8i motor
you<00:01:01.710> can<00:01:01.769> see<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.159> much<00:01:02.399> smaller<00:01:02.819> and<00:01:03.210> it's

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:03.749 
you can see is much smaller and it's

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:05.479 
you can see is much smaller and it's
also<00:01:03.899> lighter<00:01:04.290> than<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.769> previous<00:01:04.800> version

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
also lighter than the previous version

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.760 
also lighter than the previous version
it's<00:01:06.090> about<00:01:06.300> 60<00:01:06.780> grams<00:01:07.020> lighter<00:01:07.320> than<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
it's about 60 grams lighter than the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.300 
it's about 60 grams lighter than the
previous<00:01:07.800> motor<00:01:08.930> also<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:10.409> new<00:01:10.770> feature<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
previous motor also a new feature of the

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.700 
previous motor also a new feature of the
gen<00:01:11.579> 2<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:11.970> see<00:01:12.270> right<00:01:12.689> here<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.990> can<00:01:13.140> see<00:01:13.350> it

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
gen 2 you see right here you can see it

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.460
