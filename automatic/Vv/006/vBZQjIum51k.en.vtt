so this game was released in 1991 still
a<00:01:47.990> few<00:01:48.259> years<00:01:48.500> before<00:01:48.890> its<00:01:49.009> developer<00:01:49.580> would

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
a few years before its developer would

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:51.700 
a few years before its developer would
release<00:01:50.240> its<00:01:50.450> breakthrough<00:01:50.750> hit<00:01:51.200> and<00:01:51.470> a

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
straightforward but the game's most

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.460 
straightforward but the game's most
distinguishing<00:02:34.760> feature<00:02:35.030> is<00:02:35.350> definitely<00:02:36.350> the

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
distinguishing feature is definitely the

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.550 
distinguishing feature is definitely the
actual<00:02:36.980> driving<00:02:37.310> C<00:02:37.910> racing<00:02:38.360> and<00:02:38.510> super<00:02:38.810> RC<00:02:39.290> Pro

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
actual driving C racing and super RC Pro

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
M it's kind of like racing on a slip and

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.140 
M it's kind of like racing on a slip and
slide<00:02:41.709> slip<00:02:42.709> and<00:02:42.950> slide<00:02:43.100> covered<00:02:43.519> in<00:02:43.610> soap<00:02:43.880> to

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
slide slip and slide covered in soap to

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.970 
slide slip and slide covered in soap to
like<00:02:44.510> one<00:02:44.690> that<00:02:44.840> you<00:02:44.930> jump<00:02:45.170> on<00:02:45.380> and<00:02:45.560> just<00:02:45.739> boom

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
like one that you jump on and just boom

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.229 
like one that you jump on and just boom
end<00:02:46.250> up<00:02:46.430> in<00:02:46.549> the<00:02:46.640> neighbor's<00:02:46.940> yard

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239

that<00:02:47.540> kind<00:02:47.780> of<00:02:47.870> slip<00:02:48.049> and<00:02:48.080> slide<00:02:48.410> so<00:02:48.980> there's

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
that kind of slip and slide so there's

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.120 
that kind of slip and slide so there's
definitely<00:02:49.430> a<00:02:49.730> learning<00:02:50.180> curve<00:02:50.390> to<00:02:51.260> taking

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130
