that wants us to grow so in the fourth
house<00:02:55.040> growing<00:02:56.040> very<00:02:56.910> deeply<00:02:57.540> which<00:02:57.870> is<00:02:58.080> get

house growing very deeply which is get

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.309 
house growing very deeply which is get
getting<00:02:59.459> stronger<00:02:59.790> actually<00:03:00.420> from<00:03:00.900> within

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
getting stronger actually from within

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.199 
getting stronger actually from within
and<00:03:01.620> of<00:03:01.799> course<00:03:02.040> if<00:03:02.250> you<00:03:02.400> are<00:03:02.580> strong<00:03:02.880> from

and of course if you are strong from
within<00:03:03.569> it<00:03:04.500> shines<00:03:05.220> from<00:03:06.120> without<00:03:06.420> as<00:03:06.870> well

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.390 
within it shines from without as well
it's<00:03:07.860> better<00:03:08.130> to<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.930> be<00:03:10.079> strong<00:03:10.590> like<00:03:10.890> that<00:03:11.160> or

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
it's better to to be strong like that or

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.690 
it's better to to be strong like that or
to<00:03:11.549> become<00:03:11.730> strong<00:03:12.299> like<00:03:12.570> that<00:03:12.810> and<00:03:13.700> Jupiter

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
to become strong like that and Jupiter

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.350 
to become strong like that and Jupiter
is<00:03:14.940> an<00:03:15.120> exultation<00:03:15.480> in<00:03:16.079> cancer<00:03:16.590> because

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
is an exultation in cancer because

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.080 
is an exultation in cancer because
cancer<00:03:18.360> is<00:03:18.959> wall<00:03:19.350> design<00:03:19.769> and<00:03:20.070> growth<00:03:20.640> is<00:03:20.880> very

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
cancer is wall design and growth is very

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.060 
cancer is wall design and growth is very

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
easy in a water sign it spreads very

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.229 
easy in a water sign it spreads very
easily<00:03:23.459> so<00:03:24.650> well<00:03:25.650> that's<00:03:26.370> why<00:03:26.640> it's<00:03:26.850> happy

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
easily so well that's why it's happy

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.060 
easily so well that's why it's happy
they're<00:03:27.420> having<00:03:28.109> Jupiter<00:03:28.560> in<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.799> fourth

rather expensive but with little tear
their<00:03:46.680> becomes<00:03:47.160> the<00:03:47.549> paradox<00:03:48.120> so<00:03:48.840> limit<00:03:49.350> is<00:03:49.560> a

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
their becomes the paradox so limit is a

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.949 
their becomes the paradox so limit is a
totally<00:03:50.370> different<00:03:50.700> energy<00:03:51.090> it's<00:03:51.600> an<00:03:51.810> energy

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
totally different energy it's an energy

can<00:04:43.760> feel<00:04:44.139> rejections<00:04:45.139> or<00:04:45.350> have<00:04:46.130> been<00:04:46.370> felt

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
can feel rejections or have been felt

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:50.830 
can feel rejections or have been felt
rejections<00:04:47.570> from<00:04:47.690> family<00:04:48.650> roots<00:04:49.389> from<00:04:50.389> people

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
rejections from family roots from people

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.940 
rejections from family roots from people
that<00:04:50.870> were<00:04:51.410> supposed<00:04:52.160> to<00:04:52.250> nurture<00:04:52.850> us<00:04:53.030> and<00:04:53.950> can

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
that were supposed to nurture us and can

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.430 
that were supposed to nurture us and can
be<00:04:55.100> a<00:04:55.130> long<00:04:55.370> way<00:04:55.669> and<00:04:56.090> can<00:04:56.540> be<00:04:56.690> something<00:04:57.050> new

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
be a long way and can be something new

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.200 
be a long way and can be something new
coming<00:04:57.860> in<00:04:58.100> but<00:04:59.380> it<00:05:00.380> means<00:05:00.650> that<00:05:00.889> now<00:05:01.310> there<00:05:02.060> it

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
coming in but it means that now there it

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.170 
coming in but it means that now there it
is<00:05:02.510> time<00:05:02.930> to<00:05:02.960> stand<00:05:03.440> up<00:05:03.680> for<00:05:03.710> Shelley<00:05:04.669> who<00:05:04.970> you

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
is time to stand up for Shelley who you

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.550 
is time to stand up for Shelley who you
really<00:05:05.360> are<00:05:05.660> on<00:05:05.990> a<00:05:06.020> very<00:05:06.229> deep<00:05:06.380> level

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
really are on a very deep level

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.250 
really are on a very deep level
especially<00:05:07.160> also<00:05:07.880> at<00:05:08.030> Uranus<00:05:08.510> in<00:05:08.750> your<00:05:08.990> sign

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
especially also at Uranus in your sign

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.219 
especially also at Uranus in your sign
you<00:05:10.130> get<00:05:10.340> the<00:05:10.520> help<00:05:10.910> to<00:05:11.210> do<00:05:11.330> that<00:05:11.360> a<00:05:11.930> bit

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
you get the help to do that a bit

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:15.330 
you get the help to do that a bit
nervous<00:05:12.610> sometimes<00:05:13.610> but<00:05:14.180> and<00:05:14.630> restless<00:05:15.110> but

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
nervous sometimes but and restless but

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.390 
nervous sometimes but and restless but
it<00:05:16.340> is<00:05:16.490> there<00:05:16.729> for<00:05:16.760> a<00:05:17.060> reason<00:05:17.380> so<00:05:18.380> the<00:05:18.800> paradox

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
it is there for a reason so the paradox

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.779 
it is there for a reason so the paradox
is<00:05:19.580> that<00:05:20.380> cancer<00:05:21.380> and<00:05:21.650> Jupiter<00:05:22.460> very

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:22.789 
is that cancer and Jupiter very

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:27.790 
is that cancer and Jupiter very
expensive<00:05:23.510> actually<00:05:24.280> supporting<00:05:25.280> and<00:05:26.800> Lilith

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
expensive actually supporting and Lilith

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.670 
expensive actually supporting and Lilith
is<00:05:27.919> about<00:05:28.190> me<00:05:28.460> it's<00:05:28.789> about<00:05:28.910> my<00:05:29.810> own<00:05:29.990> identity

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
is about me it's about my own identity

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.090 
is about me it's about my own identity
it's<00:05:30.979> about<00:05:31.280> I<00:05:32.030> don't<00:05:32.570> care<00:05:32.990> if<00:05:33.050> people<00:05:33.680> reject

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:34.100 
it's about I don't care if people reject

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.880 
it's about I don't care if people reject
me<00:05:34.370> I<00:05:34.580> do<00:05:35.180> it<00:05:35.570> anyway<00:05:35.690> what<00:05:36.289> I<00:05:36.320> have<00:05:36.560> to<00:05:36.740> do

standing<00:05:47.960> up<00:05:48.080> for<00:05:48.350> yourself<00:05:48.470> and<00:05:49.130> doing<00:05:49.460> the

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
standing up for yourself and doing the

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
stuff that you have to do anyway so

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.060 
stuff that you have to do anyway so
paradoxes<00:05:53.450> are<00:05:53.600> here<00:05:53.990> not<00:05:54.320> to<00:05:54.560> be<00:05:54.650> solved

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.070 
paradoxes are here not to be solved

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:56.890 
paradoxes are here not to be solved
that's<00:05:55.280> the<00:05:55.880> first<00:05:56.090> thing<00:05:56.240> but<00:05:56.479> people<00:05:56.810> don't

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900 
that's the first thing but people don't

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.050 
that's the first thing but people don't
like<00:05:57.200> paradoxes<00:05:57.919> because<00:05:58.280> they're<00:05:58.490> not<00:05:58.669> they

00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.060 
like paradoxes because they're not they

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.440 
like paradoxes because they're not they
cannot<00:05:59.510> be<00:05:59.840> solved<00:06:00.380> but<00:06:01.220> when<00:06:01.970> those<00:06:02.240> two

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:02.450 
cannot be solved but when those two

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.260 
cannot be solved but when those two
energies<00:06:02.930> are<00:06:03.110> here<00:06:03.289> together<00:06:03.789> it<00:06:04.789> reflects

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
energies are here together it reflects

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.409 
energies are here together it reflects
it<00:06:05.539> has<00:06:05.780> to<00:06:05.960> be<00:06:06.050> that<00:06:06.229> way<00:06:06.289> and<00:06:06.850> it<00:06:07.850> reflects

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:08.419 
it has to be that way and it reflects

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:12.879 
it has to be that way and it reflects
that<00:06:08.740> it<00:06:09.740> has<00:06:10.070> to<00:06:10.220> be<00:06:10.340> balanced<00:06:10.789> out<00:06:10.990> so<00:06:11.990> it

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:12.889 
that it has to be balanced out so it

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:14.770 
that it has to be balanced out so it
could<00:06:13.250> mean<00:06:13.430> many<00:06:13.580> things<00:06:13.760> it<00:06:14.150> can<00:06:14.330> mean<00:06:14.539> that

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:14.780 
could mean many things it can mean that

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.190 
could mean many things it can mean that
you<00:06:14.930> are<00:06:15.139> going<00:06:15.350> to<00:06:15.620> lift<00:06:15.860> some

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:16.200 
you are going to lift some

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.810 
you are going to lift some
where<00:06:16.320> that<00:06:16.560> people<00:06:16.890> say<00:06:17.010> what<00:06:17.280> the<00:06:17.550> hell<00:06:17.700> are

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:17.820 
where that people say what the hell are

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.420 
where that people say what the hell are
you<00:06:18.180> going<00:06:18.330> to<00:06:18.600> do<00:06:18.920> some<00:06:19.920> people<00:06:20.190> who<00:06:20.280> are<00:06:20.400> very

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.430 
you going to do some people who are very

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.780 
you going to do some people who are very
close<00:06:20.880> to<00:06:21.120> you<00:06:21.150> your<00:06:21.420> family<00:06:21.450> or<00:06:22.010> you<00:06:23.010> can<00:06:23.280> have

close to you your family or you can have

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:28.220 
close to you your family or you can have
to<00:06:24.920> transform<00:06:25.920> your<00:06:26.550> job<00:06:26.850> because<00:06:27.480> this

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:28.230 
to transform your job because this

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:30.760 
to transform your job because this
energy<00:06:28.620> opposes<00:06:29.250> Pluto<00:06:29.670> in<00:06:29.820> your<00:06:30.000> tent<00:06:30.270> and

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:30.770 
energy opposes Pluto in your tent and

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.660 
energy opposes Pluto in your tent and
you<00:06:31.770> know<00:06:31.950> you<00:06:32.010> feel<00:06:32.430> as<00:06:32.730> if<00:06:32.840> your<00:06:33.840> roots<00:06:34.110> are

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:34.670 
you know you feel as if your roots are

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:38.180 
you know you feel as if your roots are
you<00:06:35.670> are<00:06:35.820> losing<00:06:36.090> it<00:06:36.510> or<00:06:36.750> you<00:06:37.350> have<00:06:37.620> to<00:06:37.830> break

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:38.190 
you are losing it or you have to break

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.980 
you are losing it or you have to break
with<00:06:38.550> the<00:06:38.580> roots<00:06:38.910> but<00:06:39.210> you<00:06:39.360> have<00:06:39.540> to<00:06:39.720> do<00:06:39.840> it

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:39.990 
with the roots but you have to do it

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.010 
with the roots but you have to do it
anyway<00:06:40.260> this<00:06:40.950> is<00:06:41.100> the<00:06:41.250> kind<00:06:41.520> of<00:06:41.670> energy<00:06:42.020> that

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.020 
anyway this is the kind of energy that

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.460 
anyway this is the kind of energy that
will<00:06:43.320> rise<00:06:43.650> and<00:06:44.040> will<00:06:44.310> become<00:06:44.730> even<00:06:45.240> more

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:45.470 
will rise and will become even more

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.530 
will rise and will become even more
prominent<00:06:46.470> next<00:06:46.980> month<00:06:47.250> because<00:06:47.550> then<00:06:48.390> it

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:48.540 
prominent next month because then it

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.810 
prominent next month because then it
opposes<00:06:48.810> Pluto<00:06:49.350> in<00:06:49.530> your<00:06:49.650> tent<00:06:49.890> house<00:06:50.160> and<00:06:50.520> put

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:50.820 
opposes Pluto in your tent house and put

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.000 
opposes Pluto in your tent house and put
it<00:06:50.910> always<00:06:51.090> about<00:06:51.210> the<00:06:51.900> transformation<00:06:52.470> and

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:53.010 
it always about the transformation and

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:56.110 
it always about the transformation and
the<00:06:53.190> rising<00:06:53.630> the<00:06:54.630> transcending<00:06:55.530> of<00:06:55.770> these

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:56.120 
the rising the transcending of these

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.030 
the rising the transcending of these
difficulties<00:06:57.120> and<00:06:57.420> these<00:06:57.600> challenges<00:06:58.320> that's

00:06:59.030 --> 00:06:59.040 
difficulties and these challenges that's

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.190 
difficulties and these challenges that's
so<00:06:59.250> much<00:06:59.400> difficulties<00:07:00.240> because<00:07:00.450> Jupiter<00:07:01.050> in

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:01.200 
so much difficulties because Jupiter in

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.430 
so much difficulties because Jupiter in
cancer<00:07:01.230> is<00:07:01.890> very<00:07:02.010> positive<00:07:03.080> but<00:07:04.080> it's<00:07:04.110> a

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:04.440 
cancer is very positive but it's a

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:09.920 
cancer is very positive but it's a
nuance<00:07:04.890> it's<00:07:05.430> a<00:07:07.010> it's<00:07:08.010> a<00:07:08.340> it's<00:07:08.580> a<00:07:09.030> paradox<00:07:09.540> so

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:09.930 
nuance it's a it's a it's a paradox so

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.280 
nuance it's a it's a it's a paradox so
there<00:07:10.590> is<00:07:10.770> a<00:07:10.800> it's<00:07:11.610> a<00:07:11.700> very<00:07:11.940> interesting

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:12.290 
there is a it's a very interesting

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:15.200 
there is a it's a very interesting
combination<00:07:13.290> actually<00:07:13.710> to<00:07:14.460> make<00:07:15.030> you<00:07:15.180> a

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:15.210 
combination actually to make you a

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.300 
combination actually to make you a
stronger<00:07:15.480> person<00:07:15.740> not<00:07:16.740> saying<00:07:17.010> that<00:07:17.190> you're

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:17.310 
stronger person not saying that you're

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:21.670 
stronger person not saying that you're
not<00:07:17.370> but<00:07:18.530> getting<00:07:19.530> there<00:07:19.710> stronger<00:07:20.250> even<00:07:21.210> more

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:21.680 
not but getting there stronger even more

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.730 
not but getting there stronger even more
so<00:07:22.680> that's<00:07:23.250> it<00:07:23.550> for<00:07:23.760> you<00:07:24.270> when<00:07:24.600> for<00:07:25.350> Aries
