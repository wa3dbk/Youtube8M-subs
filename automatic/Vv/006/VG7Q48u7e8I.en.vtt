00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.670
 to make the chain exchange to people 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:09.540
 You need this key and chain. 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.540
 obviously and pay attention to the following 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.719
 the pins that connect the chain links 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:19.650
 almost all of them are practically all 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:23.550
 same type except that of the assembly and 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.740
 disassembly this is for 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.099
 to note that it is he does not have this 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.769
 bevelled it more easily leaves side 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.570
 of the chain is here that pin 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.300
 have not suffered even though he leaves more 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:41.280
 easy to fit people who thought 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.930
 and it is good to note that the 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.460
 ends and which are key 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.920
 supported by this link 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:52.230
 back here to this current that 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.379
 He does not suffer, lest he be 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.070
 crumpled when removing the pin 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:04.470
 now the procedure is simple ones that 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:07.380
 here the key until the exit of the pine observes 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.560
 that the plan is already leaving it goes to the 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.560
 Last 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.920
 let's do the placement of the new chain 

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:36.939
 huh 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:40.299
 is the same model is the current she comes 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:42.369
 a little larger than the size it is 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.860
 required here in the application 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.509
 so I made her decrease with the 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.100
 key of the chain I compared with the 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:49.840
 old chain size 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.640
 there are other methods to know the 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.939
 current size you can check 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.459
 then on that current in these 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:02:01.989
 more modern chains a little you 

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:05.829
 observe one side of them has the inscription 

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:11.079
 the brand also to see if there is to 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:14.709
 see the gazeta shimano kg 4601 and the other 

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:19.349
 side has not wrote anything right current 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:23.799
 she is says is indexed and that side that has 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:26.739
 the inscriptions should stay out here 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:36.010
 Let's do placement. 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:38.590
 the current passed through the 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:47.829
 flowerbed 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:49.540
 then spent here send down is 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:53.709
 chain becomes loose it does not need 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:03:00.370
 get stuck there at the same crown headquarters 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:03:07.060
 thing to observe her passing through the 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:16.230
 cassette then upper pulley 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:16.230
 here to bring her told in this round 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:22.739
 so we run the chain through 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:29.139
 the front field passes through the 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:30.280
 the cassette comes here on the 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:32.349
 top 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.380
 the chain passes through the front 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:38.470
 napoli napoli from below 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:41.310
 the chain passes behind that comes 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:44.500
 to join another part of the chain 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:48.010
 to show this junction now here with 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:54.040
 these two parts here and obviously 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:57.040
 missing a pin is the pin that's coming 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.570
 together with the chain will also need 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:03.280
 not to end 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:07.440
 beyond the key stemming from pliers and 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:14.140
 if called deep in the guide 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:18.340
 this part of it but it's fine it enters 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:24.420
 first it completely crosses the link 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:24.420
 of the chain placed here 

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:32.710
 I notice the guide pin it crosses it's 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.650
 thinner than the part that will stay 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:38.919
 really that part goes through 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:44.129
 it serves as a guide for now the people 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:44.129
 put the current key 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:55.449
 I left because I thought it was well placed, right? 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:58.090
 if these edges are touching 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:02.770
 in the chain link not to knead the 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:06.009
 And now we're squeezing the 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.120
 key so that this thicker part of the 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:12.460
 pin right 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:14.349
 in the guide cross the chain to the side 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.979
 from there they do a little bit more 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:20.949
 force but soon thereafter he 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:26.789
 begins to run a certain ease 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:34.570
 we put this cucumber until the 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:37.590
 approach is leveled here with the 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:40.509
 chain edge 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:43.120
 Good, so the guide has already crossed 

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:51.370
 completely now with the help of a 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:53.220
 pliers that come and remove this part to 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.389
 this part that is the guide 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:06:01.780
 now we can take the key off 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:06:04.570
 current and observing the movement which is 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.229
 is not locked is flowing as in the 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:08.409
 others 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:11.380
 who also observe the edges so do not 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:13.750
 have opinion is spare no 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:17.080
 side if there was no formation of 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:28.270
 sides it's all perfect 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:32.050
 so this is we can go now 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:34.620
 obviously, it is only necessary to regulate the 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.620
 marches 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:41.800
 He arrived, everything's okay. 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:45.659
 This is it or pedaling for everybody 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.659
 reminding me that it never felt so good
