sees 29,000 eco-tourists a year 7 7
meters<00:02:23.490> away<00:02:23.670> so<00:02:23.850> I<00:02:24.360> think<00:02:25.110> that<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.830> whole

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
meters away so I think that the whole

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.920 
meters away so I think that the whole
idea<00:02:26.430> that<00:02:26.820> this<00:02:26.940> is<00:02:27.150> totally<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.510> natural

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
idea that this is totally a natural

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:34.600 
idea that this is totally a natural
situation<00:02:28.910> is<00:02:29.910> to<00:02:30.150> be<00:02:30.240> argued<00:02:30.600> also

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.900 

the<00:02:35.180> mission<00:02:35.540> of<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:36.290> gorilla<00:02:37.070> doctors<00:02:37.520> is<00:02:37.730> to

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
the mission of the gorilla doctors is to

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.650 
the mission of the gorilla doctors is to
sustain<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:39.440> species<00:02:40.120> and<00:02:41.120> so<00:02:41.420> we<00:02:42.160> try<00:02:43.160> not<00:02:43.340> to

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
sustain the species and so we try not to

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.740 
sustain the species and so we try not to
intervene<00:02:44.660> with<00:02:45.290> nature<00:02:46.330> but<00:02:47.330> at<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.480> same

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
intervene with nature but at the same

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.740 
intervene with nature but at the same
time<00:02:48.250> have<00:02:49.250> to<00:02:49.400> sustain<00:02:49.610> the<00:02:49.910> population<00:02:50.030> have

do intervention in only two ways or two

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.500 
do intervention in only two ways or two
reasons<00:03:17.470> the<00:03:18.470> one<00:03:18.650> is<00:03:18.860> when<00:03:19.820> is<00:03:19.940> human<00:03:20.239> induced

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
reasons the one is when is human induced

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.190 
reasons the one is when is human induced
or<00:03:21.070> when<00:03:22.070> it's<00:03:22.250> something<00:03:22.520> that<00:03:22.820> we<00:03:23.050> feel<00:03:24.050> like

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
or when it's something that we feel like

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.130 
or when it's something that we feel like
it<00:03:24.440> may<00:03:24.620> cost<00:03:24.860> the<00:03:25.100> life<00:03:25.250> of<00:03:25.520> a<00:03:25.670> burrito<00:03:26.300> so

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
it may cost the life of a burrito so

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.810 
it may cost the life of a burrito so
this<00:03:27.530> is<00:03:27.560> the<00:03:27.890> two<00:03:28.070> ways<00:03:28.220> we<00:03:28.400> do<00:03:28.489> interventions

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
this is the two ways we do interventions

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.690 
this is the two ways we do interventions
with<00:03:29.690> guerrilla<00:03:30.260> doctors<00:03:30.680> we<00:03:31.370> are<00:03:31.489> taking

with guerrilla doctors we are taking

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.510 
with guerrilla doctors we are taking
care<00:03:31.850> of<00:03:32.090> them<00:03:32.780> every<00:03:33.290> day<00:03:33.320> that's<00:03:34.130> mean<00:03:34.340> if

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
there are any problem we do we know how

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.280 
there are any problem we do we know how
to<00:03:37.459> behave<00:03:37.610> and<00:03:37.940> the<00:03:38.000> next<00:03:38.450> day<00:03:38.540> if<00:03:38.810> you<00:03:39.170> need

to behave and the next day if you need

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.320 
to behave and the next day if you need
to<00:03:39.440> do<00:03:39.709> an<00:03:39.799> intervention<00:03:40.100> we<00:03:40.580> do<00:03:40.760> it<00:03:40.850> it's

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
to do an intervention we do it it's

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.240 
to do an intervention we do it it's

still having a long way to go because

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:27.940 
still having a long way to go because
they<00:04:26.960> are<00:04:27.020> still<00:04:27.260> the<00:04:27.440> threats<00:04:27.740> we<00:04:27.830> are

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
they are still the threats we are

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.920 
they are still the threats we are
talking<00:04:28.220> about<00:04:28.310> they<00:04:28.790> are<00:04:28.880> still<00:04:29.090> that's

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
talking about they are still that's

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.570 
talking about they are still that's
still<00:04:30.110> there<00:04:30.320> I<00:04:30.530> think<00:04:30.860> the<00:04:30.950> project<00:04:31.400> is

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
still there I think the project is

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.750 
still there I think the project is
successful<00:04:31.880> in<00:04:32.510> that<00:04:32.540> it's<00:04:33.550> reached<00:04:34.550> its

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
successful in that it's reached its

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.120 
successful in that it's reached its
original<00:04:35.270> mission<00:04:35.510> which<00:04:35.870> was<00:04:35.900> to<00:04:36.140> sustain

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
original mission which was to sustain

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.879 
original mission which was to sustain
the<00:04:37.280> population<00:04:37.430> and

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
the population and

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:40.830 
the population and
