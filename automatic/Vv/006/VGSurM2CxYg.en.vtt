me show you how this actually works in
here<00:01:10.490> it<00:01:11.030> sits<00:01:11.389> right<00:01:11.509> into<00:01:11.749> your<00:01:11.869> portafilter

00:01:12.099 --> 00:01:12.109 
here it sits right into your portafilter

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:14.410 
here it sits right into your portafilter
there<00:01:12.590> is<00:01:12.679> a<00:01:12.709> slight<00:01:13.069> opening<00:01:13.280> the<00:01:14.119> nice<00:01:14.270> thing

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
there is a slight opening the nice thing

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.149 
there is a slight opening the nice thing
about<00:01:14.479> that<00:01:14.869> is<00:01:15.109> that<00:01:15.139> when<00:01:15.439> the<00:01:15.560> coffee<00:01:15.829> brews

about that is that when the coffee brews
through<00:01:16.459> the<00:01:16.850> capsule<00:01:17.689> it's<00:01:18.229> never<00:01:18.380> going<00:01:18.499> to

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
through the capsule it's never going to

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.830 
through the capsule it's never going to
come<00:01:18.679> in<00:01:18.799> contact<00:01:18.829> with<00:01:19.249> the<00:01:19.399> Porta<00:01:19.700> filter

then<00:04:56.469> actually<00:04:56.860> if<00:04:56.919> we<00:04:57.039> can<00:04:57.189> look<00:04:57.849> in<00:04:58.000> here<00:04:58.150> a

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
then actually if we can look in here a

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.339 
then actually if we can look in here a
little<00:04:58.389> closer<00:04:58.569> actually<00:04:58.930> look<00:04:59.020> at<00:04:59.110> the<00:04:59.169> brew

00:04:59.339 --> 00:04:59.349 
little closer actually look at the brew

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:02.369

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:10.599 
whereas on the eeper model you do have a

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:12.809 
whereas on the eeper model you do have a
little<00:05:10.779> bit<00:05:10.930> different<00:05:11.349> looking<00:05:11.819> because

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:12.819 
little bit different looking because

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:14.219 
little bit different looking because
that<00:05:12.969> actually<00:05:13.120> has<00:05:13.360> to<00:05:13.539> have<00:05:13.659> a<00:05:13.870> puncture

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:14.229 
that actually has to have a puncture

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:16.260 
that actually has to have a puncture
point<00:05:14.620> where<00:05:14.889> you<00:05:15.039> can<00:05:15.310> puncture<00:05:15.789> the<00:05:15.879> capsule

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
allowing the water to flow through so

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.850 
allowing the water to flow through so
you<00:05:17.889> can<00:05:18.099> brew<00:05:19.319> all<00:05:20.319> right<00:05:20.409> so<00:05:20.560> let's<00:05:20.710> make<00:05:20.830> a
