00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.270 
the top of the backswing all right and
and<00:02:03.760> so<00:02:04.570> this<00:02:05.320> is<00:02:05.440> actually<00:02:05.560> a<00:02:05.799> moment<00:02:06.159> in<00:02:06.250> time

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
the target that's why i bumped on that

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:12.619 
the target that's why i bumped on that
line<00:04:09.540> because<00:04:09.930> if<00:04:10.169> you<00:04:10.530> if<00:04:10.709> you<00:04:11.099> if<00:04:11.370> you<00:04:12.239> turn

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
you have to be only move in a golf swing

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.040 
you have to be only move in a golf swing
that<00:04:51.910> can<00:04:52.060> make<00:04:52.210> the<00:04:52.360> bump<00:04:52.600> come<00:04:52.780> straight

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
that can make the bump come straight

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.379 
that can make the bump come straight

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.510 
non square and solid through impact
coming<00:05:05.320> from<00:05:05.410> the<00:05:05.530> inside<00:05:05.860> so<00:05:06.070> you<00:05:06.100> can<00:05:06.220> square

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
coming from the inside so you can square

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.600 
coming from the inside so you can square
up<00:05:06.550> and<00:05:06.790> hit<00:05:06.880> the<00:05:06.910> ball<00:05:07.120> relatively<00:05:07.630> straight

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
up and hit the ball relatively straight

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.129 
up and hit the ball relatively straight
you<00:05:09.610> can<00:05:09.790> only<00:05:10.030> make<00:05:10.389> that<00:05:10.570> move<00:05:10.810> with<00:05:11.110> a

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:11.139 
you can only make that move with a

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:12.629 
you can only make that move with a
lateral<00:05:11.470> shift<00:05:11.889> because<00:05:12.280> that's<00:05:12.460> the<00:05:12.610> only

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 
lateral shift because that's the only

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:15.120 
lateral shift because that's the only
move<00:05:13.180> that<00:05:13.630> drops<00:05:13.930> the<00:05:14.110> arms<00:05:14.380> or<00:05:14.650> pulls<00:05:15.010> the

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
move that drops the arms or pulls the

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.980 
move that drops the arms or pulls the
arms<00:05:15.400> straight<00:05:15.790> down<00:05:16.030> and<00:05:16.270> for<00:05:16.750> the<00:05:16.810> first

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
arms straight down and for the first

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.530 
arms straight down and for the first
second<00:05:17.470> when<00:05:17.620> this<00:05:17.950> is<00:05:18.130> gone<00:05:18.340> and<00:05:18.669> you<00:05:19.210> look<00:05:19.360> at

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.540 
second when this is gone and you look at

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.330 
second when this is gone and you look at
almost<00:05:19.720> any<00:05:19.930> video<00:05:20.229> you<00:05:20.350> ever<00:05:20.560> see<00:05:20.740> me<00:05:20.770> face<00:05:21.130> on

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
almost any video you ever see me face on

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.890 
almost any video you ever see me face on
you're<00:05:21.490> going<00:05:21.610> to<00:05:21.669> see<00:05:21.850> that<00:05:22.060> as<00:05:22.210> I'm<00:05:22.660> coming

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
you're going to see that as I'm coming

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.469 
you're going to see that as I'm coming
up<00:05:23.110> that<00:05:23.260> hip<00:05:23.470> is<00:05:23.620> going<00:05:23.650> and<00:05:24.160> and<00:05:24.850> that's<00:05:25.210> what

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
up that hip is going and and that's what

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:27.180 
up that hip is going and and that's what
pulls<00:05:25.720> the<00:05:25.870> arms<00:05:26.139> down<00:05:26.290> so<00:05:26.710> I<00:05:26.740> get<00:05:26.950> a<00:05:26.979> little

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
pulls the arms down so I get a little

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.430 
pulls the arms down so I get a little
bit<00:05:27.370> of<00:05:27.460> free<00:05:27.669> fall<00:05:27.940> boom<00:05:28.600> which<00:05:29.050> adds<00:05:29.290> the

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
bit of free fall boom which adds the

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.530 
bit of free fall boom which adds the
speed<00:05:29.740> and<00:05:29.950> then<00:05:30.400> from<00:05:30.669> there<00:05:30.850> both<00:05:31.120> hands<00:05:31.389> and

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:31.540 
speed and then from there both hands and

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.450 
speed and then from there both hands and
arms<00:05:31.780> because<00:05:31.930> i<00:05:32.020> use<00:05:32.200> try<00:05:32.919> to<00:05:32.979> use<00:05:33.160> equal

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
arms because i use try to use equal

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.190 
arms because i use try to use equal
pressure<00:05:33.639> grip<00:05:34.389> pressure<00:05:34.539> on<00:05:34.780> my<00:05:34.870> hands<00:05:35.080> and

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 
pressure grip pressure on my hands and

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.230 
pressure grip pressure on my hands and
swinging<00:05:35.530> them<00:05:35.620> in<00:05:35.710> equal<00:05:35.800> speeds<00:05:36.250> as<00:05:36.880> soon<00:05:37.120> as

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
swinging them in equal speeds as soon as

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.180 
swinging them in equal speeds as soon as
i<00:05:37.330> get<00:05:37.389> that<00:05:37.660> bump<00:05:37.960> going<00:05:38.289> i'm<00:05:38.410> just<00:05:38.860> going<00:05:39.130> to

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
i get that bump going i'm just going to

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.570 
i get that bump going i'm just going to
what<00:05:39.430> it<00:05:40.360> goes<00:05:40.630> and<00:05:40.870> then<00:05:41.590> my<00:05:42.160> arms<00:05:42.400> are<00:05:42.490> just

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
what it goes and then my arms are just

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.670 
what it goes and then my arms are just
exploding<00:05:43.180> through<00:05:43.300> impact<00:05:43.690> and<00:05:43.930> everything

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
exploding through impact and everything

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.820 
exploding through impact and everything
is<00:05:44.770> to<00:05:44.889> do<00:05:45.039> what<00:05:45.220> stand-up<00:05:46.139> afap<00:05:47.139> to<00:05:47.560> the<00:05:47.650> t
