00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
drains so by the end of the day my

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.690 
drains so by the end of the day my
battery<00:02:34.320> is<00:02:34.350> usually<00:02:34.680> I<00:02:34.740> like<00:02:34.800> five<00:02:35.160> percent

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
battery is usually I like five percent

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:44.060 
battery is usually I like five percent
but<00:02:36.570> I<00:02:36.600> do<00:02:36.720> use<00:02:37.050> it<00:02:37.080> a<00:02:37.290> lot<00:02:37.440> so<00:02:37.800> a<00:02:42.890> little<00:02:43.890> tough

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
but I do use it a lot so a little tough

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.750 
but I do use it a lot so a little tough
to<00:02:44.100> get<00:02:44.340> out<00:02:44.550> but<00:02:45.530> it's<00:02:46.530> okay<00:02:46.800> you<00:02:47.190> you<00:02:47.580> never

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
to get out but it's okay you you never

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.070 
to get out but it's okay you you never
really<00:02:48.120> have<00:02:48.210> to<00:02:48.360> take<00:02:48.510> it<00:02:48.660> out<00:02:48.750> of<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.930> case

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
really have to take it out of the case

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.510 
really have to take it out of the case
because<00:02:49.380> whenever<00:02:49.590> you<00:02:49.950> do<00:02:50.070> charge<00:02:50.340> it

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
because whenever you do charge it

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.130
