00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
there are a lot of students a lot of

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.160 
there are a lot of students a lot of
beginners<00:00:49.619> who<00:00:50.070> tried<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.549> play<00:00:50.790> ecology<00:00:51.780> and

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
beginners who tried to play ecology and

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.680 
beginners who tried to play ecology and
scale<00:00:52.559> or<00:00:52.769> something<00:00:53.100> like<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.420> it's<00:00:54.420> okay

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
scale or something like that it's okay

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.719 
scale or something like that it's okay
but<00:00:54.900> I<00:00:55.199> don't<00:00:55.559> recommend<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.309> do<00:00:56.460> that

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:56.729 
but I don't recommend you to do that

00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:01.130 
but I don't recommend you to do that
because<00:00:57.030> it's<00:00:57.420> sometimes<00:00:58.379> its<00:00:59.420> high<00:01:00.420> level<00:01:00.930> um

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
because it's sometimes its high level um

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.390 
because it's sometimes its high level um
probably<00:01:01.860> you<00:01:02.699> won't<00:01:02.909> have<00:01:03.619> enough<00:01:04.619> technique

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
probably you won't have enough technique

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.670 
probably you won't have enough technique
