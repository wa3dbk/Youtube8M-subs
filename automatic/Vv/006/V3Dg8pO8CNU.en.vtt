you don't use good masking paper then
what<00:03:16.970> will<00:03:17.060> happen<00:03:17.360> is<00:03:17.510> the<00:03:17.690> chemicals<00:03:18.110> will

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
what will happen is the chemicals will

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.160 
what will happen is the chemicals will
actually<00:03:18.680> bleed<00:03:18.950> through<00:03:19.630> the<00:03:20.630> overspray

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
actually bleed through the overspray

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.800 
actually bleed through the overspray
will<00:03:21.620> bleed<00:03:21.830> through<00:03:22.100> the<00:03:22.280> masking<00:03:22.760> paper<00:03:23.360> and

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
will bleed through the masking paper and

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.920 
will bleed through the masking paper and
get<00:03:24.200> contaminated<00:03:25.130> onto<00:03:25.430> your<00:03:25.670> product<00:03:26.660> and

get contaminated onto your product and

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.800 
get contaminated onto your product and
then<00:03:27.080> that<00:03:27.320> would<00:03:27.470> result<00:03:27.739> in<00:03:27.920> a<00:03:28.040> really<00:03:28.190> bad

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
then that would result in a really bad

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.130 
then that would result in a really bad
paint<00:03:29.810> job<00:03:30.760> finally<00:03:31.760> after<00:03:32.600> you've<00:03:32.989> got
