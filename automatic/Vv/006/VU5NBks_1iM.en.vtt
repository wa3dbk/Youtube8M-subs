Shane the honors of pushing play on the
video<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:14.670> talking<00:00:14.969> us<00:00:15.150> through<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.420> project

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.250 

so<00:00:30.500> first<00:00:30.949> we<00:00:31.070> had<00:00:31.220> to<00:00:31.340> take<00:00:32.000> the<00:00:32.180> box<00:00:32.390> off<00:00:32.689> so

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
so first we had to take the box off so

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.780 
so first we had to take the box off so
we<00:00:33.500> could<00:00:33.680> get<00:00:33.860> at<00:00:33.980> the<00:00:34.129> back<00:00:34.309> of<00:00:34.520> the<00:00:34.610> cab

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
we could get at the back of the cab

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.330 
we could get at the back of the cab
corners<00:00:35.149> we<00:00:36.020> put<00:00:36.200> some<00:00:36.379> braces<00:00:36.559> in<00:00:36.980> it<00:00:37.160> and

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
corners we put some braces in it and

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.020 
corners we put some braces in it and
then<00:00:37.790> we<00:00:37.940> cut<00:00:38.300> out<00:00:38.449> the<00:00:38.559> cab<00:00:39.559> corners<00:00:39.890> on<00:00:40.489> both

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
then we cut out the cab corners on both

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.200 
then we cut out the cab corners on both
sides<00:00:41.530> the<00:00:42.530> extended<00:00:43.129> cab<00:00:43.280> cab<00:00:43.699> corner<00:00:44.090> is

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
sides the extended cab cab corner is

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.350 
sides the extended cab cab corner is
designed<00:00:44.629> for<00:00:45.370> for<00:00:46.370> their<00:00:46.489> hinges<00:00:46.760> and<00:00:47.210> what

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
designed for for their hinges and what

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.450 
designed for for their hinges and what
they<00:00:47.480> do<00:00:47.540> is<00:00:47.839> they<00:00:48.050> made<00:00:48.530> strength<00:00:48.980> where<00:00:49.280> the

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
they do is they made strength where the

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.390 
they do is they made strength where the
hinge<00:00:49.699> bolts<00:00:50.030> to<00:00:50.420> so<00:00:50.780> that<00:00:50.930> can<00:00:51.140> actually<00:00:51.400> hold

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.400 
hinge bolts to so that can actually hold

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.060 
hinge bolts to so that can actually hold
up<00:00:52.699> the<00:00:52.909> entire<00:00:53.030> way<00:00:53.449> to<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:53.720> door<00:00:53.930> and<00:00:54.350> and

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
up the entire way to the door and and

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.399 
up the entire way to the door and and
like<00:00:55.879> hold<00:00:56.150> it<00:00:56.269> as<00:00:56.420> it's<00:00:56.690> like<00:00:56.870> swinging<00:00:57.170> open

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:57.409 
like hold it as it's like swinging open

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:00.310 
like hold it as it's like swinging open
and<00:00:57.739> everything<00:00:57.980> and<00:00:58.430> the<00:00:59.390> the<00:00:59.720> original<00:00:59.870> cab

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
and everything and the the original cab

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.100 
and everything and the the original cab
corner<00:01:00.769> for<00:01:01.040> the<00:01:01.189> crew<00:01:02.119> cab<00:01:02.330> pickups<00:01:02.809> they

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
corner for the crew cab pickups they

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.100 
corner for the crew cab pickups they
have<00:01:03.710> very<00:01:04.369> little<00:01:04.699> strength<00:01:05.000> to<00:01:05.269> them<00:01:05.420> there

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
have very little strength to them there

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.780 
have very little strength to them there
they<00:01:06.409> wouldn't<00:01:06.890> be<00:01:06.950> able<00:01:07.159> to<00:01:07.220> hold<00:01:07.430> the<00:01:07.610> door

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
they wouldn't be able to hold the door

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.160 
they wouldn't be able to hold the door
up<00:01:08.229> so<00:01:09.229> that's<00:01:09.530> a<00:01:09.710> big<00:01:10.010> reason<00:01:10.159> why<00:01:10.430> the

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
up so that's a big reason why the

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.530 
up so that's a big reason why the
extended<00:01:12.170> cab<00:01:12.320> cab<00:01:12.770> corners<00:01:13.010> were<00:01:13.280> used<00:01:13.540> for

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
extended cab cab corners were used for

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.120 
extended cab cab corners were used for
the<00:01:14.689> the<00:01:15.110> backing<00:01:15.619> sleeves<00:01:15.950> I<00:01:16.720> actually<00:01:18.130> made

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
the the backing sleeves I actually made

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.700 
the the backing sleeves I actually made
those<00:01:19.310> out<00:01:19.610> of<00:01:19.640> the<00:01:19.850> chunks<00:01:20.509> of<00:01:20.689> the<00:01:20.869> old<00:01:21.320> cab

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
those out of the chunks of the old cab

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.590 
those out of the chunks of the old cab
corner<00:01:22.250> that<00:01:22.610> was<00:01:22.850> pretty<00:01:23.240> much<00:01:23.360> the<00:01:23.570> same

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
corner that was pretty much the same

metal for those sleeves that were in

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.330 
metal for those sleeves that were in
there<00:01:47.300> and<00:01:47.570> leaving<00:01:48.470> just<00:01:48.650> like<00:01:48.860> a<00:01:48.890> little<00:01:49.159> bit

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
there and leaving just like a little bit

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.690 
there and leaving just like a little bit
of<00:01:49.490> a<00:01:49.580> gap<00:01:49.820> for<00:01:50.180> the<00:01:50.270> world<00:01:51.220> so<00:01:52.220> the<00:01:52.340> very<00:01:52.520> back

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
of a gap for the world so the very back

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.290 
of a gap for the world so the very back
panel<00:01:53.590> we<00:01:54.590> were<00:01:55.070> able<00:01:55.370> to<00:01:55.400> just<00:01:55.610> use<00:01:55.790> that<00:01:56.000> you

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
panel we were able to just use that you

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.450 
panel we were able to just use that you
know<00:01:56.420> the<00:01:56.570> original<00:01:56.960> back<00:01:57.200> panel<00:01:57.650> of<00:01:57.830> the

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
know the original back panel of the

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.030 
know the original back panel of the
truck<00:01:58.729> and<00:01:59.030> so<00:01:59.810> I<00:01:59.840> drilled<00:02:00.350> out<00:02:00.500> the<00:02:00.530> spot

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
truck and so I drilled out the spot

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.399 
truck and so I drilled out the spot
welds<00:02:01.430> that<00:02:01.490> held<00:02:02.060> it<00:02:02.240> to<00:02:02.420> the<00:02:02.600> cab<00:02:02.900> corners

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
welds that held it to the cab corners

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.260 
welds that held it to the cab corners
and<00:02:03.770> did<00:02:04.040> the<00:02:04.130> same<00:02:04.340> when<00:02:04.490> we<00:02:04.549> took<00:02:04.790> out<00:02:05.000> the

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
and did the same when we took out the

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.630 
and did the same when we took out the

cab corners for the extended cab and

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.029 
cab corners for the extended cab and
we're<00:02:08.390> pretty<00:02:08.569> much<00:02:08.720> able<00:02:09.080> to<00:02:09.200> just<00:02:09.440> put<00:02:09.860> them

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
we're pretty much able to just put them

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.320 
we're pretty much able to just put them
right<00:02:10.250> back<00:02:10.310> in<00:02:10.700> where<00:02:10.849> they<00:02:10.970> were<00:02:11.030> supposed

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.839 
to go and then do all the plug welds for
the<00:02:14.299> back<00:02:14.480> and<00:02:14.950> mate<00:02:15.950> pretty<00:02:16.280> much<00:02:16.430> make<00:02:16.670> it

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
the back and mate pretty much make it

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.449 
the back and mate pretty much make it
look<00:02:17.000> like<00:02:17.209> it<00:02:17.420> was<00:02:17.720> you<00:02:18.349> know<00:02:18.379> a<00:02:18.769> factory

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
look like it was you know a factory

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.449 
look like it was you know a factory
piece<00:02:19.819> we<00:02:20.030> cut<00:02:20.239> out<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.930> back<00:02:21.650> section<00:02:21.980> of<00:02:22.280> the

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
piece we cut out the back section of the

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.089 
piece we cut out the back section of the
extended<00:02:22.909> cab<00:02:23.090> doors<00:02:23.420> where<00:02:23.810> the<00:02:24.110> where<00:02:25.069> the

hinge<00:02:25.400> is<00:02:25.549> bolt<00:02:25.849> to<00:02:27.489> we<00:02:28.489> cut<00:02:28.700> them<00:02:28.879> out<00:02:29.030> and

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
hinge is bolt to we cut them out and

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.380 
hinge is bolt to we cut them out and
then<00:02:29.450> we<00:02:29.569> also<00:02:29.720> cut<00:02:30.080> out<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:30.200> opening<00:02:30.799> in<00:02:31.010> the

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
piece from the extended cab door into

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.160 
piece from the extended cab door into
the<00:02:37.490> crew<00:02:37.700> cab<00:02:37.910> door

then cleaning up all the welds and yeah
there's<00:02:47.930> definitely<00:02:48.050> a<00:02:48.709> lot<00:02:49.280> of<00:02:49.340> time<00:02:49.640> that

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
there's definitely a lot of time that

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.699 
there's definitely a lot of time that
went<00:02:50.030> into<00:02:50.180> that<00:02:50.420> that's<00:02:50.900> for<00:02:51.110> sure

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
went into that that's for sure

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.880 
went into that that's for sure
so<00:02:52.490> we<00:02:52.610> pretty<00:02:52.850> much<00:02:53.140> took<00:02:54.140> the<00:02:54.319> existing

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890

universal suicide hinge you wouldn't get
that<00:03:37.400> full<00:03:37.670> range<00:03:37.910> of<00:03:38.120> motion<00:03:38.570> all<00:03:38.900> the<00:03:39.050> way

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
that full range of motion all the way

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.130 
that full range of motion all the way
out<00:03:39.380> and<00:03:39.739> it<00:03:40.130> actually<00:03:40.340> like<00:03:40.700> you<00:03:40.940> know<00:03:41.140> sits

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
in front of the wheel with a regular you

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.770 
in front of the wheel with a regular you
know<00:03:50.299> suicide<00:03:50.600> hinge<00:03:51.079> that<00:03:51.290> you<00:03:51.410> just<00:03:51.620> by<00:03:52.780> you

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
know suicide hinge that you just by you

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.840 
know suicide hinge that you just by you
you<00:03:54.170> won't<00:03:54.380> get<00:03:54.620> that<00:03:54.829> full<00:03:55.160> opening<00:03:55.640> then
