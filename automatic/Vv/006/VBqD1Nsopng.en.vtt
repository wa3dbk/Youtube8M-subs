00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
kimbos as a couple of reason why I'm

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.740 
kimbos as a couple of reason why I'm
using<00:01:54.750> these<00:01:55.080> is<00:01:55.970> well<00:01:56.970> the<00:01:57.060> first<00:01:57.270> reason<00:01:57.360> you

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
using these is well the first reason you

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.240 
using these is well the first reason you
get<00:01:57.930> them<00:01:58.080> out<00:01:58.229> really<00:01:58.500> quick<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.979> think<00:01:59.159> the

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
get them out really quick I think the

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.490 
get them out really quick I think the
draw<00:01:59.460> times<00:01:59.759> like<00:02:00.090> third<00:02:00.810> of<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.049> second<00:02:01.409> or

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
draw times like third of a second or

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.770 
draw times like third of a second or
something<00:02:01.799> because<00:02:01.890> their<00:02:02.100> handguns<00:02:02.780> that's

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
something because their handguns that's

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.480 
something because their handguns that's
the<00:02:03.899> advantage<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.409> them<00:02:04.590> over<00:02:04.890> like<00:02:05.009> machine

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
the advantage of them over like machine

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.370 
the advantage of them over like machine
pistols<00:02:05.940> were<00:02:06.119> something<00:02:06.810> like<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:07.049> another

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
pistols were something like that another

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.340
