00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:13.309
 the boys are you black that I am today 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.200
 here to tell you about the new 1.10 patch 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:18.380
 exits on April 30th for an eco bus where 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.420
 both on playstation 3 and xbox 360 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.460
 the main thing that brought this 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.320
 part is the addition of I have no mode 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.599
 we find this mode in the list 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.369
 bonus is called arms race 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:28.970
 practically consists of a deathmatch a 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.530
 teams 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:36.559
 if you are against you are up to 65 points but 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.479
 for every kill and we will gain 150 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.330
 points so it will be much easier 

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:45.650
 get the score strix ie the series 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:47.360
 of points so it is precisely is called the 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.089
 point series war is just 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.739
 started so it's really beautiful 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:53.809
 mobility because a lot of malaise 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.049
 quickly then keep lying 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.790
 always in the air swarm helicopters 

00:00:56.049 --> 00:01:00.379
 lots and lots of rewards 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.330
 also in the description of this 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.850
 update says it has been added 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:07.250
 a virtually post-match questionnaire 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.430
 and after each game that allows 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:14.540
 to some players to evaluate bears wings 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.610
 to answer a question that allows 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.500
 to evaluate the connection of the game 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.300
 played I honestly haven't yet 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.490
 since I don't know exactly where 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.670
 whether this question is presented 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.800
 only to some players 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.940
 however, I didn't understand what it was 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.040
 whether 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.260
 also been updated by many 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.090
 glistati run lots of nearby napa 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.159
 mob of the dead regarding xbox 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.810
 360 from where on pressure between threads between 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.240
 two weeks 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.680
 and indeed fixed bugs there 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.659
 allowed to enter the mode 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.750
 pht whole airlife in the doors though not 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:50.360
 since there is a test for HIV while I am 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.950
 several spawns have been fixed since 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.300
 with the latest patch and update not 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.670
 he had satisfied most of the 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.180
 users is this here we are on 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.980
 major changes 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.740
 that brought this peace the peace of the 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.960
 April 30 also brought so many 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.810
 changes to the gameplay you can find 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.420
 complete peace in the description will tell 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.190
 some for example a note vertigo nimis 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.160
 the east I could not enter the center 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:19.360
 of the map and so I am a stake like that 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.280
 small problem then they were corrected 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.110
 of bugs in the magma map I had 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.180
 being able to enter the lava socket 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.010
 jan dix in some corners near between the 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.010
 road and lava then go under the 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.350
 map been correct is a blitz for 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.640
 As it concerned the killing machine the 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.220
 war machine that allowed to 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.110
 have endless ammunition correct state 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.370
 in the field a game error where 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.200
 practically positive to some 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.980
 players to survive even if the 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.690
 Crossbow dart was attacked 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.320
 in the end they were correct let's say 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.760
 other errors for series of points 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.950
 errors related to the game 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.660
 as for the shield since 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.000
 we cannot create ourselves with the anti shield 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.459
 riot in hand assault shield us 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.050
 while we treat we press the x key for 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.180
 lie down in places you will be performing 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.400
 dolphin dive we will pass the 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.230
 failed heel without having to stop 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.440
 run and then crouch this me 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.150
 helped slightly in the final correct 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.030
 many other errors in theater mode 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.100
 in dual play mode when you 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.910
 he tried to connect to twitter 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.290
 this was a stream and other things 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.730
 so guys, I apologize for the brief 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.900
 duration of this video I recommend 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.760
 to go and try the new mode 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.200
 arms race that anyway 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.720
 pretty enough then if you put yourself on 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.400
 inflexible really the priests very much 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.410
 quickly point series if you have to 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.540
 spell out some challenges related to 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.519
 eventual to any score strix 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.540
 I recommend this mode which is by 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.880
 these take it back enough 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.739
 quickly if you liked the video 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.870

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.769
