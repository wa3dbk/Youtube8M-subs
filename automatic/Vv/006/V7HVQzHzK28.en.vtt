(Rock music: "Son of May" by Dave Zagorski.)

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:41.500
After about three years of slight to severe
personality changes, Dave was diagnosed with

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:48.500
adult-onset x-linked ALD in April 2009. The
disease caused major brain damage. But Dave

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.500
maintained his charismatic, fun-loving personality.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.500
(Inaudible greeting.)  

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.500
(Dave laughs.)  

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.500
Hey everybody, rock on.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:24.210
I met Dave when I was twenty. I married him
six years later and I held his head when he 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.270
died seven years after that.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:52.500
(Rock music.)

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.170
What I wish is that brain research would find
a way to stop the progression of ALD. I would

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.000
love to see brain research stop the world
from losing another Dave.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:14.420
(Rock music.)
