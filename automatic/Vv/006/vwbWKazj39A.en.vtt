00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
square oval so it's straight across the

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
bit of a curve on the edges so they're

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.560 
bit of a curve on the edges so they're
not<00:00:46.680> too<00:00:47.010> sharp<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:48.210> want<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.420> make<00:00:48.539> sure
