they're<00:00:31.759> essentially<00:00:32.210> the<00:00:32.239> same<00:00:32.360> machine

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
they're essentially the same machine

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:35.350 
they're essentially the same machine
just<00:00:33.020> different<00:00:33.410> tunnel<00:00:33.800> dimensions<00:00:34.370> now<00:00:35.300> the

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
just different tunnel dimensions now the

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.990 
just different tunnel dimensions now the
mini<00:00:35.660> panic<00:00:35.930> galaxy<00:00:36.890> can<00:00:37.070> use<00:00:37.219> up<00:00:37.399> to<00:00:37.430> a<00:00:37.550> 21

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
mini panic galaxy can use up to a 21

mini panic galaxy can use up to a 21
inch<00:00:38.030> wide<00:00:38.450> wheel<00:00:38.690> in<00:00:39.380> this<00:00:39.590> case<00:00:39.890> we're

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:40.130 
inch wide wheel in this case we're

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.010 
inch wide wheel in this case we're
actually<00:00:40.309> going<00:00:40.550> to<00:00:40.640> use<00:00:40.730> a<00:00:40.880> 12<00:00:41.329> inch<00:00:41.540> web<00:00:41.780> app

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
actually going to use a 12 inch web app

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.930 
actually going to use a 12 inch web app
the<00:00:42.860> nice<00:00:43.010> thing<00:00:43.190> about<00:00:43.219> these<00:00:43.489> machines<00:00:43.670> is

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
the nice thing about these machines is

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.150 
the nice thing about these machines is
you<00:00:44.030> can<00:00:44.180> use<00:00:44.360> anything<00:00:44.660> up<00:00:44.989> to<00:00:45.200> 21<00:00:45.680> inches<00:00:45.860> so

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
you can use anything up to 21 inches so

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.860 
you can use anything up to 21 inches so
you<00:00:46.190> can<00:00:46.370> go<00:00:46.490> all<00:00:46.610> the<00:00:46.640> way<00:00:46.730> down<00:00:46.910> to<00:00:47.060> 12<00:00:47.330> or

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
you can go all the way down to 12 or

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.050 
you can go all the way down to 12 or
even<00:00:48.200> smaller<00:00:48.470> if<00:00:48.590> you<00:00:48.650> wanted<00:00:48.950> to<00:00:49.130> this<00:00:49.340> site

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:50.060 
even smaller if you wanted to this site

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.520 
even smaller if you wanted to this site
right<00:00:50.300> here<00:00:50.450> actually<00:00:50.570> slides<00:00:51.200> back<00:00:51.500> and

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
right here actually slides back and

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.890 
right here actually slides back and
forth<00:00:51.770> to<00:00:52.160> adjust<00:00:52.610> and<00:00:53.240> accommodate<00:00:53.329> the

forth to adjust and accommodate the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.510 
forth to adjust and accommodate the
different<00:00:54.230> sizes<00:00:54.530> of<00:00:54.920> film<00:00:55.160> that<00:00:55.250> you<00:00:55.340> might

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
different sizes of film that you might

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.090 
different sizes of film that you might
be<00:00:55.670> using<00:00:56.000> it<00:00:56.780> can<00:00:56.870> be<00:00:56.990> used<00:00:57.170> with<00:00:57.320> polyolefin

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
be using it can be used with polyolefin

case we're using polyolefin film a

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.990 
case we're using polyolefin film a
polyolefin<00:01:03.350> film<00:01:03.829> has<00:01:03.950> that<00:01:04.250> clear<00:01:04.549> wider

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
polyolefin film has that clear wider

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.480 
polyolefin film has that clear wider
color<00:01:05.509> to<00:01:05.780> it<00:01:05.960> the<00:01:06.770> biggest<00:01:06.950> difference<00:01:07.399> is

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
color to it the biggest difference is

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.859 
color to it the biggest difference is
the<00:01:07.520> poly<00:01:07.850> elephant<00:01:08.180> film<00:01:08.360> has<00:01:08.479> more<00:01:08.689> of<00:01:08.780> a

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
the poly elephant film has more of a

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.560 
the poly elephant film has more of a
stretchy<00:01:09.850> saran-wrapped<00:01:10.850> feel<00:01:11.180> to<00:01:11.420> it

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
stretchy saran-wrapped feel to it

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.420 
stretchy saran-wrapped feel to it
whereas<00:01:11.750> the<00:01:11.780> PVC<00:01:12.470> film<00:01:12.710> which<00:01:12.950> is<00:01:13.070> actually<00:01:13.399> a

whereas the PVC film which is actually a
little<00:01:13.490> bit<00:01:13.670> more<00:01:13.790> common<00:01:14.119> is<00:01:15.079> it<00:01:15.140> a<00:01:15.259> bit<00:01:15.439> more

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
little bit more common is it a bit more

food that the polyurethane film can be
used<00:01:21.380> with<00:01:21.560> food<00:01:21.789> so<00:01:22.789> in<00:01:22.850> this<00:01:22.939> situation<00:01:23.179> we

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:24.079 
used with food so in this situation we

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:26.529 
used with food so in this situation we
want<00:01:24.259> to<00:01:24.380> roll<00:01:24.590> on<00:01:24.799> here<00:01:25.359> we've<00:01:26.359> got<00:01:26.479> just

want to roll on here we've got just

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:29.469 
want to roll on here we've got just
going<00:01:26.840> to<00:01:26.929> slide<00:01:27.170> this<00:01:27.319> out<00:01:28.179> so<00:01:29.179> we<00:01:29.359> have

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
going to slide this out so we have

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.919 
going to slide this out so we have
enough<00:01:29.799> excess<00:01:30.799> plastic<00:01:31.639> here<00:01:31.909> to<00:01:32.420> be<00:01:32.509> cut<00:01:32.780> off

00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:32.929 
enough excess plastic here to be cut off

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:34.300 
enough excess plastic here to be cut off
and<00:01:33.139> create<00:01:33.319> a<00:01:33.380> proper<00:01:33.740> seal<00:01:33.950> on<00:01:34.100> the<00:01:34.159> bottom
