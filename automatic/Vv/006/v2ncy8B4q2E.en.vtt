 pound of sweet potatoes cooked in water and 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:44.129

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.860

 it gets crushed all the same by 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.390
 all 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.060
 now that our potato is all over 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.570
 kneaded 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:32.540
 We'll add half a cup and 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.540
 green parsley parsley and chives 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:41.190
 soon after we'll believe 2 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:45.390
 cups and half-day thing would 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:48.690
 this will give the brand consistency 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.900
 let's mix until you think mass 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:55.440
 group plus our hands that is easy to 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:58.800
 curl and make rolls that later 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.430
 stole in office in size and let's 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.430
 to determine 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.380
 We're going to have to lay our hands on the masses. 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.330
 now that the dough is all over here 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.120
 kneaded and ready is no longer helping 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.880
 in the hand we'll make a shower of 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:26.489
 rice flour and start making the 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:29.550
 rollers watch the rolls they get 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:33.150
 more or less the thickness of a finger and 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:36.510
 then we'll cut each in ok from 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:40.769
 two to three centimeters in length 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:43.950
 according to your preference you 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:46.260
 you can use a knife or a spatula 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.860
 to make these cuts 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.500
 Meanwhile I put more or less 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:57.510
 four liters of water to boil in 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:03:00.120
 high fire with a spoonful of shallow salt 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:06.870
 not exaggerate the salt in the 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:11.910
 excess is bad for our health will 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:14.430
 cutting on ok and reserving all of them 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.790
 you can go packing in a 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:20.690

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.690
 rice flour 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:34.140

 receive the envelopes and I go 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:46.290
 depositing all of them until they 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.730
 come to surface when they 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.670
 start climbing 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.519
 this indicates that they are already cooked and 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:57.810
 I can hide the 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:04:01.760
