00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:06.900
 welcome to set up and it is super further we are coming in 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.780
 are just a major issue 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.830
 mr thank you to the device crashed down of course very nice and 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.210
 shoot for daily 9 and then there may be someone from the second 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.939
 world war 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:21.689
 so far i'm super nice then people are running fast because of the illness 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:22.550
 nice out 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.710
 the we did but thanks to the signs we moved quickly so that eventually 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.060
 we played so what nonsense I am also very excited for a long time 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.930
 in it 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.230
 and we are going to ask what things do to the people who come in 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.940
 of the track and a wait for that which game and the base 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:40.940
 really just 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.229
 the closing post 

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:44.859
 a tight place in the points classification on a strong platform 

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:48.569
 give i get the verdicts places from cantu team anyway who had that 

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:52.780
 thought really football that the side of the globe in addition also a 

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:55.170
 top thematically 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.620
 and but i think i'm waiting for what she's waiting for 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.040
 if they win 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.219
 make the incident a reality 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:06.630
 I can't wait now for one to get this site 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.070
 that part so hope I find it interesting to stop all in all 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.600
 viewer himself if we go by what people ask a question about what they are 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.750
 find firstlook 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.200
 what a but people waiting 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.110
 it goes by courier and prevents 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.770
 also for which 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.950
 you really do not look forward to fresh 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.690
 I hope it's in the city 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.110
 that's pure 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.960
 I know you the turning point 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.990
 also and severely disappointed about which game are you really enlarged 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.170
 I think safety 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.920
 it would stay 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.560
 come to feed most people 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.159
 yes ikea worth 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.250
 9 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.800
 and nowadays it also has five matches, the first goal 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.460
 in front of 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.060
 played twice each 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.450
 especially not dealing with the old players who are normal 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.590
 which game could see forward 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.660
 of course I only heard a few hundred battlefields come by 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.470
 why explain both times to customers' practice 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.090
