richard<00:00:55.780> Sartain<00:00:56.290> i<00:00:56.320> think<00:00:56.769> possibly<00:00:57.220> has<00:00:57.430> the

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
richard Sartain i think possibly has the

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.299 
richard Sartain i think possibly has the
edge<00:00:57.790> in<00:00:58.089> wrestling<00:00:58.600> knowledge<00:00:59.019> or<00:00:59.309> natural

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
edge in wrestling knowledge or natural

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:02.549 
edge in wrestling knowledge or natural
wrestling<00:01:00.760> ability<00:01:01.269> but<00:01:01.449> we'll<00:01:02.170> just<00:01:02.379> have<00:01:02.530> to

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
wrestling ability but we'll just have to

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.060 
wrestling ability but we'll just have to
see<00:01:03.210> who<00:01:04.210> can<00:01:04.510> prevail<00:01:04.900> in<00:01:05.199> this<00:01:05.379> because<00:01:05.799> it's

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
see who can prevail in this because it's

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.649 
see who can prevail in this because it's
strength<00:01:06.430> against<00:01:06.939> cunning

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
strength against cunning

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:09.450 
strength against cunning
I<00:01:07.689> think<00:01:08.200> Sartain<00:01:08.650> maybe<00:01:08.890> a<00:01:08.979> little<00:01:09.130> bit<00:01:09.310> more

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
I think Sartain maybe a little bit more

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.399 
I think Sartain maybe a little bit more
smooth<00:01:09.820> with<00:01:10.090> his<00:01:10.180> motion<00:01:10.659> he<00:01:10.780> may<00:01:10.930> have<00:01:11.140> more

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
smooth with his motion he may have more

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:12.750 
smooth with his motion he may have more
of<00:01:11.470> a<00:01:11.560> definite<00:01:11.950> attack<00:01:12.220> plan<00:01:12.520> I<00:01:12.700> think

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
of a definite attack plan I think

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.490 
of a definite attack plan I think
throughout<00:01:13.450> the<00:01:13.630> past<00:01:13.869> couple<00:01:14.109> of<00:01:14.229> weeks<00:01:14.380> and

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
throughout the past couple of weeks and

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.469 
throughout the past couple of weeks and
watching<00:01:14.890> Jim<00:01:15.130> boss<00:01:15.369> he<00:01:15.880> seems<00:01:16.119> just<00:01:16.240> to<00:01:16.390> go

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
watching Jim boss he seems just to go

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:17.940 
watching Jim boss he seems just to go
out<00:01:16.539> and<00:01:16.719> try<00:01:16.869> to<00:01:16.929> out<00:01:17.140> Power<00:01:17.409> Man<00:01:17.770> which

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
out and try to out Power Man which

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.609 
out and try to out Power Man which
strength<00:01:18.520> is<00:01:18.700> his<00:01:18.850> strong<00:01:19.479> suit<00:01:19.780> I<00:01:19.929> would<00:01:19.990> I

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
strength is his strong suit I would I

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:21.779 
strength is his strong suit I would I
guess<00:01:20.890> is<00:01:21.039> how<00:01:21.130> you<00:01:21.189> would<00:01:21.369> put<00:01:21.549> it<00:01:21.670> but

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789 
guess is how you would put it but

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:23.609 
guess is how you would put it but
Sartain<00:01:22.299> he's<00:01:22.840> more<00:01:23.049> of<00:01:23.109> a<00:01:23.140> psychological
