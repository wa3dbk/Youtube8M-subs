00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:12.639
 active from today this game looks like 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:14.120
 bottom the sense was alive serenely 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.939
 way the cannes 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:20.919
 at this point it is logical that later 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:25.550
 the stakes with count participate 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:28.160
 speak in full about basketball 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.040
 tributes of the other clashes peraro fine 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:35.420
 of turn if then the missio paint always 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:37.219
 a big difference though if we that 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.030
 we are great 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:48.219
 in this this situation if you 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:52.249
 allow us to make an appeal we are 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:54.739
 68 and we are a chat team and the 

00:00:52.249 --> 00:01:00.679
 characteristics different from those 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:02.600
 average directions played a lot that 

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:05.030
 they read as soon as situations have a 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.159
 true play maker we honestly don't 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.360
 we have carbide problems we have some 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.670
 guards ok 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.259
 therefore our way of playing is a bit 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.320
 done in this way because not 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:18.380
 we have a discreet way 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.869
 but it seemed to me to see at the end that 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.759
 circles you play to play in the final 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.969
 with an Italian team 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:28.729
 and we dislike it but it seems to us that we 

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:31.539
 we were in another league that 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:35.060
 it looked like the Italian team 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:38.329
 however I can make no compliments 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.060
 in front of this thing here however it seemed 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:43.610
 that you because we had 8 seven streets 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.689
 foreigners eight foreigners is a thing and 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.820
 the other one 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.560
 we looked like an American team that 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.049
 minimum playing the Italian league e 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.119
 we were able but we did 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.820
 with the rules we have made 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.710
 these choices with our players 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.799
 as I close, they are two different teams 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.899
 in short , few or for progress 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:05.240
 who made the valley because I think 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.100
 I would like to see someone start the 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.390
 championship someone thought that of 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.069
 valley protests 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.830
 and if someone tells me he believed it 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.150
 and original nobody thought that of 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.520
 valley has everything you touch 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.280
 you seemed to make the environment play 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:24.090
 right for me who work well in others 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.550
 continents and everything but we are also 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.120
 we a team our strengths and ours 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.860
 spikes and now we'll start cheering for 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.880
 italy also sony costello before 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:39.000
 forming passage from rosarno must 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.400
 however, respond to a fraction of others 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.110
 scale decision on the player 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:48.239
 this difference is the high tech team in 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.310
 that moment held that those c.so. 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.709
 that could decide it seems there is 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.930
 went to the stop which salvarer is or was 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.510
 only if the northern one is logical that I want 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:03.510
 to say that happened to the santos 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:05.100
 an important thing or collapses or 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.750
 put in everything you have with 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:12.900
 anger because you feel a little well-established 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.579
 logical that even sosa is difficult then 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.980
 especially for the Caribbean 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:19.980
 when there is this thing you find with 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:23.160
 the leaders of liam and bumps to stay a lot 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:26.340
 yes or no will certainly be enough for you 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.350
 kill them the square that billions 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:33.780
 Sassari would have arrived in the final for 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:36.959
 what goes to milan and what final perhaps 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:40.739
 worse Sassari I know you do n't even know 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:42.060
 story they gave it, I only did one 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.180
 final to the player who knows all the 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.579
 knee 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.760
 on that occasion I had the logical reason 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:51.890
 which was a little surely done that is 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.689
 reported to varese 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.510
 even if it matters little this is the scudetto 

00:03:53.689 --> 00:04:00.109
 sardinia all because surely 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:02.780
 the thing brought us all together 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:05.049
 sardinia or a small piece of varese is there 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.049
 inside
