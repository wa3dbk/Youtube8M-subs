00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
face in the head I was basing it off of

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.219 
face in the head I was basing it off of
this<00:01:59.430> one<00:01:59.729> image<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:00.390> found<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:03.110> as<00:02:04.110> you

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
this one image that I found and as you

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:04.960 
this one image that I found and as you

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.080 
can see
that<00:02:05.120> looks<00:02:05.450> kind<00:02:05.960> of<00:02:06.230> complicated<00:02:07.100> and<00:02:07.820> it

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
that looks kind of complicated and it

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.220 
that looks kind of complicated and it
was<00:02:08.510> especially<00:02:09.430> painting<00:02:10.430> it<00:02:10.580> with<00:02:11.360> my

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
was especially painting it with my

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.040

paintbrush

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
paintbrush

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.770 
paintbrush
that's<00:02:15.050> the<00:02:15.200> bush<00:02:15.380> I<00:02:15.530> use<00:02:16.390> those<00:02:17.390> to<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.630> boy

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
so imagine painting on small detail

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.490 
so imagine painting on small detail
paintbrush<00:02:25.030> easier<00:02:26.030> than<00:02:26.210> toothpicks<00:02:26.690> yes

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
paintbrush easier than toothpicks yes

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:34.060 
paintbrush easier than toothpicks yes
but<00:02:28.090> complicated<00:02:31.300> so<00:02:32.300> what<00:02:33.170> I<00:02:33.200> got<00:02:33.530> that<00:02:33.740> I<00:02:33.770> was

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
but complicated so what I got that I was

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.040 
but complicated so what I got that I was
like<00:02:34.250> that<00:02:34.460> this<00:02:34.670> looks<00:02:35.210> amazing

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.330 
like that this looks amazing
it<00:02:36.560> does<00:02:37.750> that's<00:02:38.750> a<00:02:38.990> sound<00:02:39.230> and<00:02:39.860> get<00:02:40.190> to

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
it does that's a sound and get to
