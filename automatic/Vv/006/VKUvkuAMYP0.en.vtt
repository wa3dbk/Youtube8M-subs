00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:06.910
 Yes Hello Muscle is at the age when 7:30 out of the second coming while night came back from the gym now from 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:11.320
 Ne it now 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:15.789
 I made a night meal with my apple so I will introduce it from now, so please take a look 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:20.050
 It's a different menu which is a little usually it this time, but here is always eat 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:20.720
 I'm I'm I think that the 8-position grilled chicken Tsu Matochikara One 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.810
 8 here 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:28.460
 Weight was told Innovation Wa is 300 grams, so 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:30.080
 In the case of raw ne three black 3 or more such so because attention to it One-chan Do 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.440
 With it 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:38.330
 I'm sorry I'm getting better with the suspension that is pork 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:44.120
 So there are 8 rooms with 8 rooms here and there is 0 in the case of Ms. 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:48.110
 So if you're a rice-plant model, it's a bit pretty much like Korean monhan sr 80 grams 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.200
 But I still do not eat too much rice is today that we become protein 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.540
 So 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:57.640
 It is here that during this period 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:01:02.650
 It would be nice if I was a mother in America and a supermarket, but I found Udon. 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:06.130
 I 'm an instant guy, but I make this udon and this noodle is some kind of raw noodle 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:09.620
 It's such a thing is a little bit, but I here 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.090
 Udon has a very big nature 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:16.880
 Some lager 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:18.799
 So if you have a fun event, it's a bit over 53g so protein is better 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.040
 To 8g 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:27.290
 After all , I should not go up this curve 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:32.000
 Dodonga I think that good if you want to take to the generous roots So Oh and this quality is low that Tanji cargo 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:37.070
 I think that this kind of trouble is good I think that when it comes to ramen, that quality is a bit 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:42.060
 It's going to be expensive, but it's low calorie if it's something like this in udon and kane 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:48.060
 No vegetables to eat is I So First two this good as it can flowers and trees 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:50.510
 I Toka spinach Those who think, but of iron vegetables and some people that I think Naa not 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.430
 I 'm mixing 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:57.620

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:07.250
 Also today I like this feeling after the early 4 tatami half early I wonder if there is still a little pump 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:09.369
 Recently my arm is around 40 centimeters 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.030
 I think it's 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:16.450
 I think that there is 40 centimeters Kana maybe 40 centimeters or more 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:20.920
 It says Gama inch Nan fabric is I do not have to calculate to 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:24.120
 It No. 10, No. 10 inches, so something in the battlefield nor a car about this 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.190
 Because there is this centimeter 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.450

 We shall go into a catchphrase in law 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:56.930
 My favorite phrase Warner's forever now for ever 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.880
 Straight and this tagline 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.420
