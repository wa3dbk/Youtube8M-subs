core<00:02:05.570> that<00:02:05.720> is<00:02:05.780> the<00:02:06.080> butter<00:02:06.290> basically<00:02:07.040> a

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
core that is the butter basically a

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.639 
core that is the butter basically a
reason<00:02:08.210> why<00:02:08.300> do<00:02:08.360> a<00:02:08.540> couple<00:02:09.050> of<00:02:09.140> quarters<00:02:09.440> so

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
reason why do a couple of quarters so

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.710 
reason why do a couple of quarters so
that<00:02:09.680> it<00:02:09.860> will<00:02:09.950> fit<00:02:10.190> perfectly<00:02:10.520> in<00:02:11.510> my

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
that it will fit perfectly in my

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.330 
that it will fit perfectly in my
strainer<00:02:12.110> when<00:02:12.380> I<00:02:12.410> court<00:02:12.770> and<00:02:13.010> I<00:02:13.040> won't<00:02:13.190> have

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
strainer when I court and I won't have

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.090 
strainer when I court and I won't have
any<00:02:13.400> left<00:02:13.670> over<00:02:14.200> so<00:02:15.200> I'm<00:02:15.350> going<00:02:15.590> to<00:02:15.620> blend<00:02:15.860> this

will<00:02:20.600> strain<00:02:20.930> it<00:02:20.960> out<00:02:21.230> and<00:02:21.830> then<00:02:22.160> I'm

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
will strain it out and then I'm

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.140 
will strain it out and then I'm
straining<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:22.910> next<00:02:23.180> one<00:02:23.390> I<00:02:23.540> will<00:02:25.000> blend<00:02:26.000> the

straining the next one I will blend the

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:33.220 
straining the next one I will blend the
next<00:02:26.510> batch<00:02:30.190> very<00:02:31.190> good<00:02:31.450> okay<00:02:32.450> I<00:02:32.630> strain<00:02:33.080> that

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
next batch very good okay I strain that

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
to the last blender full so it will get

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.660 
to the last blender full so it will get
mixed<00:03:08.330> in<00:03:08.450> with<00:03:08.570> on<00:03:08.780> with<00:03:08.900> the<00:03:09.050> rest<00:03:09.230> of<00:03:09.380> it

mixed in with on with the rest of it

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.900 
mixed in with on with the rest of it
when<00:03:10.670> I<00:03:10.940> strain<00:03:11.720> it<00:03:11.750> out<00:03:11.989> I<00:03:12.459> used<00:03:13.459> to<00:03:13.580> not<00:03:13.730> add

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
when I strain it out I used to not add

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.610 
when I strain it out I used to not add
the<00:03:14.060> sugar<00:03:14.390> until<00:03:14.510> I<00:03:14.720> was<00:03:14.900> ready<00:03:15.110> to<00:03:15.200> use<00:03:15.440> it

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
the sugar until I was ready to use it

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.220 
the sugar until I was ready to use it
but<00:03:15.800> it's<00:03:16.130> since<00:03:16.970> my<00:03:17.150> son<00:03:17.420> drinks<00:03:17.720> almost<00:03:17.870> off

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
all of it and please don't do that Lanie

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.920

it's<00:03:23.930> easier<00:03:24.350> just<00:03:24.410> to<00:03:24.680> have<00:03:24.920> it<00:03:24.950> already

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
it's easier just to have it already

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.750 
it's easier just to have it already
you<00:03:26.239> could<00:03:26.480> also<00:03:26.660> add<00:03:26.989> vanilla<00:03:27.459> this<00:03:28.459> makes

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
you could also add vanilla this makes

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.699 
you could also add vanilla this makes
about<00:03:28.910> two<00:03:29.209> quarts<00:03:29.450> so<00:03:29.690> you<00:03:30.260> can<00:03:30.410> add<00:03:30.530> vanilla

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
about two quarts so you can add vanilla

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.780 
about two quarts so you can add vanilla

blend of strain this while the milk is
sir<00:03:39.950> rather<00:03:40.400> than<00:03:40.700> rice<00:03:41.090> it's<00:03:41.360> still<00:03:41.540> quite

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
sir rather than rice it's still quite

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.570 
sir rather than rice it's still quite
hot<00:03:42.050> if<00:03:42.440> you<00:03:42.800> were<00:03:43.340> to<00:03:44.530> to<00:03:45.530> let<00:03:46.190> it<00:03:46.340> sit<00:03:46.550> and

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
hot if you were to to let it sit and

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.880 
hot if you were to to let it sit and
cool<00:03:46.910> down<00:03:47.090> and<00:03:47.360> then<00:03:47.450> blend<00:03:47.720> it<00:03:47.840> you<00:03:48.470> see<00:03:48.680> how

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
cool down and then blend it you see how

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.690 
cool down and then blend it you see how
all<00:03:49.190> of<00:03:49.220> those<00:03:49.519> little<00:03:51.250> like<00:03:52.250> it's<00:03:52.430> squirting

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
all of those little like it's squirting

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.870 
all of those little like it's squirting
from<00:03:52.970> all<00:03:53.180> the<00:03:53.330> little<00:03:53.570> holes<00:03:53.720> in<00:03:54.230> the<00:03:54.290> fabric

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
from all the little holes in the fabric

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.970 
from all the little holes in the fabric
it<00:03:55.880> would<00:03:56.120> be<00:03:56.239> much<00:03:56.570> much<00:03:56.810> worse<00:03:57.080> and<00:03:57.410> would

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
it would be much much worse and would

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.530 
it would be much much worse and would
spray<00:03:58.340> everywhere<00:03:58.910> and<00:03:59.060> make<00:03:59.180> a<00:03:59.209> huge

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
spray everywhere and make a huge

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.990 
spray everywhere and make a huge
disaster<00:04:00.230> and<00:04:00.500> it<00:04:01.100> also<00:04:01.280> is<00:04:01.489> much<00:04:01.670> harder

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
disaster and it also is much harder

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.630 
disaster and it also is much harder
takes<00:04:02.420> a<00:04:02.540> lot<00:04:02.690> more<00:04:02.720> effort<00:04:03.110> to<00:04:03.590> squeeze<00:04:04.340> it

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
takes a lot more effort to squeeze it

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.990 
takes a lot more effort to squeeze it
out

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
out

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.680 
out
so<00:04:05.810> do<00:04:06.709> it<00:04:06.740> while<00:04:07.040> the<00:04:07.160> rice<00:04:07.340> is<00:04:07.550> still<00:04:07.640> hot

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
so do it while the rice is still hot

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:16.140 
so do it while the rice is still hot
definitely<00:04:09.170> do<00:04:09.320> with<00:04:09.410> that<00:04:10.000> and<00:04:11.980> now<00:04:12.980> I<00:04:14.140> have

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
definitely do with that and now I have

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.520 
definitely do with that and now I have
about<00:04:17.150> two<00:04:17.360> quarts<00:04:17.600> of<00:04:18.280> Rights<00:04:19.280> Malcolm<00:04:19.760> and

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
about two quarts of Rights Malcolm and

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.070 
about two quarts of Rights Malcolm and
last<00:04:21.530> little<00:04:21.830> bit<00:04:22.040> of<00:04:22.280> I<00:04:22.640> think<00:04:23.450> this<00:04:23.690> is<00:04:23.840> rice

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
last little bit of I think this is rice

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.730 
last little bit of I think this is rice
