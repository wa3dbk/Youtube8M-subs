00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 all beaver dear friends with you windows and 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.460
 Today we talk about the top 5 most 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.309
 five nights at interesting theories 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.370
 freddy's and so fifth place you know what 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.440
 von guy at 4 am in the first part was killed 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.540
 inhumanly severed somehow due not 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.430
 motronic of but we know that in each 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.740
 five nights at freddy's should be a background 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.660
 Guy what will he be I think you know 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.970
 what's on five nights at freddys 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.580
 1 and five nights at freddys 2 background Guy 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.560
 voiced by scott huffman himself and there it is 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.449
 it was pretty well explained then 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.920
 there is a background guy in the first part already hit 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.230
 however, in the second part as she 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.000
 prequel he is not dead yet so scott 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.460
 can calm it voiced but 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.770
 the third part which comes in 30 years 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.579
 after the first there is already so easy not 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.250
 turn away 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.500
 and comes out two options the first is that scott 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.840
 will get himself some new howl with 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.430
 actor what does a voice actor mean 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.590
 there will be some other person who 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.170
 will voice the background of the guy who will 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.149
 somehow tied to the plot take into account the theory 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.800
 about the fact that the new five nights at freddys 3 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.780
 will be nothing more than an attraction for 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.100
 visitors from want to write to 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.439
 I will tell the comments more about 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.850
 this theory, the phone guy will 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.229
 the person who will explain 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.360
 every visitor 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.189
 his tasks as a guard so 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.439
 way the background guy will serve that 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.049
 attraction and guide functions 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.869
 another option is that background guy will somehow 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.030
 associated with the previous background Guy maybe he 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.020
 his son or something like that and he 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.290
 investigates 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.200
 and trying to find out how his father died as 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.090
 1 background guy died who is guilty for it and whom 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.310
 punish building on this 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.740
 maybe we'll be with him in the game 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.900
 conduct some kind of investigation and so 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.570
 way we will be there in the role 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.290
 something like a detective another theory and 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.640
 the fact that the fourth part will be me 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.040
 I think early to talk about what will happen 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.259
 fourth part however cattle in one of 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.070
 asked for your attention not 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.380
 call your fan games fnaf 3 or in nov 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.079
 4 and this confirms that Scott is already 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.360
 conceived to release v-4 number theory 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.579
 three here that will be more than 1 floor 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.860
 because if you remember in fnaf 1 it was 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.440
 quite a few rooms in fnaf 2 already 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.880
 there was more coma on the idea in fnaf 3 nude 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.010
 need to be more rooms well or 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.380
 at least not less than fnaf 2 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.240
 but on teasers and current pictures 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.330
 which we see rooms are much, much 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.400
 less what if the button on which 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.380
 written click or any other button 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.630
 which we may not have seen will send 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.390
 us to the second floor so it was 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.250
 solved questions about what's in the game 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.050
 just one animatronic because 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.850
 The rest animatronics also which 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.370
 were shown in the trailer will 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.170
 located on the second floor and there we are 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.780
 We will be able to see our favorite ones Freddy 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.340
 Freddy that check and others also for this 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.380
 the theory says that little arrow 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.930
 which is shown near one of the entrances 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.180
 The fact is that this arrow can be 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.220
 nothing but the stairs through which 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.440
 animatronics may fall from the second 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.290
 floor at first think about it after all 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.060
 it can be super cool and theory 2.5 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.680
 I dare not call her 2 because 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.230
 what is this theory that i don't have 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.080
 the answer to the description of the game says that 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.270
 new attraction occurs in 30 years 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.290
 after closing pizzeria 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:12.120
 however what with pizza fnaf1 fnaf2 or 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.100
 may be the very first of pizzerias 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.080
 freddy give me this is worth thinking about 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.690
 guys write what you think about it 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.370
 finally theory number two they i think 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.890
 many of you have heard however not 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.320
 to say about her would be wrong new 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.050
 animatronic is actually purple 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.000
 guy after 4 nights purple 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.010
 the guy was killed by animatronics they 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.230
 decided that it would be nice to pay him 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.870
 the fact that he did with them because 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.760
 wait a second these animatronics have kids 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.070
 the souls of the children who were sharpened in 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.769
 animatronic suits and so after 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:46.880
 his murders put him in a suit of it 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:50.310
 broken animatronics passed 30 years 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.950
 the suit spread even more and was almost 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.230
 do not collect but after they opened 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.390
 new attraction creators of this 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.000
 the restaurant has collected animatronics in parts 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.070
 and so he appeared a guy 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.510
 which is called soul edge well or in 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.370
 you can translate it in Russian 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.100
 as a trophy collector because he absorbed 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.140
 in itself everything can be said the very best of 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.080
 animatronics and now for this 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.380
 the attraction is roaming animatronic with 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.500
 the soul of a purple man killed 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.989
 are you who are now looking for your victim as well 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.880
 plus this theory is the fact that he has 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.980
 there is generally speaking the brain has been noticed 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.140
 that the new animatronics have nothing 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.030
 anything like a brain in his head that can 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.260
 also mean that he is 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.780
 by man 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.240
 well or a person who is in 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.250
 body animatronic easier to say kiba well and 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.080
 just of course not forget about uh um 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.360
 steelhead what can mean what 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.600
 purple guy gives us to understand that he 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:47.570
 still here you forgot him but he 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:50.750
 back in 30 years again ready 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:53.090
 kill and number one theory is a theory about 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.640
 that foxy will be one of the most 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.320
 main opponents in fnaf 3 foxy 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.390
 is one of the most beloved 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.910
 animatronic players in five nights at 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:03.710
 freddys 3 and scott just can't 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.840
 take it and turn it into a paw 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.760
 so the same lamp which all 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:11.210
 they say it is nothing more than simple 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:13.040
 lamp which is made on a foxy but 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.860
 the fact that foxy has never been anywhere before 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.910
 shown not in teaser not in trailers 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.650
 makes us think about what 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.930
 Scott actually cooks us big 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:24.200
 a surprise that will concern foxy and 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:26.480
 foxy suddenly for players not take 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.820
 the smallest role in the game five nights at 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:31.610
 freddys 3 and maybe it will be there 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:33.560
 of the worst or dangerous scarecrow 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.390
 of in this game because she is serious i 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.370
 don't believe at all that fight nights at 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.990
 freddys 3 will be one animatronic but 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.610
 this can not be a game then it will be 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.650
 too boring therefore 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.050
 somehow possible on the second 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:48.890
 floor possible to some of the ventilation 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:52.100
 we can see this redhead cute face 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:52.920
 which will jump on the player and kill him 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.840
 probably 

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.670
 and on this all dear friends write your 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.320
 proposals on the theory of VKontakte and 

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:00.060
 leave your comments
