00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
then you're going to pull the fabric so

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.190 
then you're going to pull the fabric so
that<00:02:45.180> it<00:02:45.299> will<00:02:45.360> reach<00:02:45.599> and<00:02:45.900> you're<00:02:45.989> going<00:02:46.140> to

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
that it will reach and you're going to

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.750 
that it will reach and you're going to
tape<00:02:46.380> it<00:02:46.590> right<00:02:46.620> there<00:02:48.560> all<00:02:49.560> right<00:02:49.620> so<00:02:50.489> now<00:02:50.640> you

have this but I'm supposed to just hold

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.130 
have this but I'm supposed to just hold
it<00:02:53.819> up<00:02:53.880> and<00:02:54.120> let<00:02:54.299> the<00:02:54.420> math<00:02:54.599> that's<00:02:54.780> annoying

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
it up and let the math that's annoying

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.100 
it up and let the math that's annoying
what<00:02:56.069> we're<00:02:56.220> going<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.430> do<00:02:56.670> is<00:02:57.090> we're<00:02:57.959> going<00:02:57.989> to

off the ground what you're going to need

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:21.650 
off the ground what you're going to need
for<00:03:09.239> that<00:03:09.390> part<00:03:09.660> is<00:03:13.430> for<00:03:14.720> 200<00:03:15.720> dowels<00:03:18.410> see<00:03:20.660> yeah

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
for that part is for 200 dowels see yeah

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.710 
for that part is for 200 dowels see yeah
and<00:03:21.959> if<00:03:22.709> you<00:03:22.829> don't<00:03:22.859> want<00:03:23.310> and<00:03:23.579> we<00:03:24.420> might<00:03:24.600> not

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
could use instead is this paper towel I

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.550 
could use instead is this paper towel I
track<00:03:32.790> I<00:03:33.000> tried<00:03:33.389> the<00:03:33.540> wooden<00:03:33.810> dowels<00:03:34.200> but<00:03:34.410> they

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
track I tried the wooden dowels but they

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.259 
track I tried the wooden dowels but they
did<00:03:34.739> not<00:03:34.889> work<00:03:35.130> so<00:03:35.400> we're<00:03:35.850> going<00:03:35.970> to<00:03:36.060> use<00:03:36.150> the

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
did not work so we're going to use the

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.190 
did not work so we're going to use the
paper<00:03:36.450> towel<00:03:36.720> to<00:03:38.150> the<00:03:39.150> paper<00:03:39.420> towel<00:03:39.720> roll<00:03:39.870> is

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
paper towel to the paper towel roll is

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.979 
paper towel to the paper towel roll is
nine<00:03:40.470> and<00:03:40.739> three-quarters<00:03:41.459> inches<00:03:41.900> so<00:03:42.900> you

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
nine and three-quarters inches so you

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.610 
nine and three-quarters inches so you
have<00:03:43.319> to<00:03:43.500> cut<00:03:43.709> that<00:03:43.920> into<00:03:44.250> fourths<00:03:44.910> I<00:03:45.470> want<00:03:46.470> my

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
have to cut that into fourths I want my

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.340 
have to cut that into fourths I want my
trampoline<00:03:47.100> to<00:03:47.459> be<00:03:47.579> high<00:03:47.760> off<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:48.090> ground<00:03:48.350> so

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350
