00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.440
 it turns out many modern 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.420
 dried fruits make a new technology 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.649
 no, everything is as before apricot 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.139
 turns into dried apricots 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.750
 or prune apricot prunes grapes 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.900
 I take only turns dried fruits 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.570
 a little different they are dried with chemicals and 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.769
 dye is dyed therefore they are so 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.869
 crumbled in recent years right 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.570
 dried fruit should air dry 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.320
 and not in the sun but in the shade so he 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.390
 will keep the taste and vitamin true for 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.030
 to apricot turned into dried apricots 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.340
 have to wait three months and wait 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.370
 manufacturers do not like time because money 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.670
 so modern dried fruit is dried 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.520
 in such huge ovens true after 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.620
 such express processing all the vitamins 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:52.079
 dried fruits perish besides the oven 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.460
 drowns not only firewood often goes 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.460
 rubber or trash 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.190
 2 place all flow just no tree and 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:02.199
 then these ovens 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.930
 they are well heated pro with what is 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:06.700
 if there is a processing here and dipped in 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.890
 boiling the wood on it to this 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.350
 boil the water they do not have but there is 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.479
 waste rubber production and therefore 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.640
 very often here it is boiling water 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.979
 fueled by this very well 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.430
 respectively, there is smoke, although he is directly 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:23.289
 no awards 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.840
 before you buy dried fruit smell 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:27.670
 them and if they smell gasoline or 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.190
 rubber means they were dried 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.240
 express method of vitamins in such 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.240
 no dried fruit 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.810
 plum and grapes 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.940
 these fruits even dry in the oven a few 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.520
 days so manufacturers came up 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.130
 this way before drying the fruit is lowered 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.710
 in caustic soda rind solution 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.900
 grapes become thinner plums dry 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.600
 faster 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.900
 That's how the fruit looks after the express 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.280
 drying dull with an ugly machine to 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.360
 give them a presentation 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.910
 dried fruits are sent to a special bath 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.630
 under the bath enclose sulfur dioxide and 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.630
 set on fire 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.170
 sulfur dioxide is a colorless gas applied 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.030
 in the production of sulfuric acid is toxic 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.030
 may cause an asthma attack or allergies 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.590
 Sulfur Dioxide Dried Fruit 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.260
 turn out bright look almost like 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.019
 fresh truth according to experts these 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.469
 beautiful dried fruits can provoke 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.469
 allergy 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.950
 eating a portion of multi-colored dried fruit 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:40.030
 Little Masha Cube HIV Covered 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:44.319

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:48.099
 mix a big package that's yours 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:51.220

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:59.049
 ok child smiles contented 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.819
 It takes about an hour and a half 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.859
 the back of the palm appears 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.950
 profuse rash will pass an hour and a half 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:09.010
 then look at the tummy and legs 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.409
 all this itches very much itches and 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.629

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:18.370
 half an hour from the car rose 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.099
 temperature parents drove the girl in 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.980
 hospital doctors diagnosed 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:25.290
 food color allergy 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.269
 because they provide exclusively 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.489
 negative impact on the elimination organs 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.829
 on the kidneys and on the stove and in what way 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:35.109
 they barely affect the child's health not 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:36.370

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:38.319
 predisposition to allergic 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.319
 diseases allergic diseases 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:43.419
 just a scourge now the modern world they 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:46.709
 may aggravate these 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:48.720
 allergic diseases ie those 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.940
 chemicals which 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.040
 unnatural for human health and 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.010
 do not use them to children in any way 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.060
 case how the dyes got into the dried fruit 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.220
 this mage 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.920
 Mom still can not understand because she 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.530
