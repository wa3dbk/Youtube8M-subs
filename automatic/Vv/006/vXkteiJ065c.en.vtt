so<00:00:03.750> how<00:00:03.870> do<00:00:03.929> you<00:00:04.020> know<00:00:04.140> if<00:00:04.200> you've<00:00:04.350> got<00:00:04.380> the

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
so how do you know if you've got the

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.710 
so how do you know if you've got the
right<00:00:04.650> brain<00:00:05.040> size<00:00:05.370> you<00:00:06.089> can<00:00:06.210> only<00:00:06.359> tell<00:00:06.600> if

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
right brain size you can only tell if

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.089 
right brain size you can only tell if
you<00:00:06.839> have<00:00:06.990> the<00:00:07.080> right<00:00:07.230> Brian<00:00:07.529> sides<00:00:07.799> by

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
you have the right Brian sides by

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.070 
you have the right Brian sides by
extracting<00:00:08.490> espresso<00:00:08.940> it's<00:00:09.630> a<00:00:09.780> combination

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
extracting espresso it's a combination

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.100 
extracting espresso it's a combination
between<00:00:10.429> dose<00:00:11.429> amount<00:00:11.849> particle<00:00:12.509> size<00:00:12.719> and

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
between dose amount particle size and

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.860 
between dose amount particle size and
tamp<00:00:14.070> pressure<00:00:14.340> so<00:00:15.330> we'll<00:00:15.480> show<00:00:15.630> you<00:00:15.660> how<00:00:15.750> to

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
tamp pressure so we'll show you how to

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.660 
tamp pressure so we'll show you how to
do<00:00:16.080> that<00:00:16.230> today<00:00:16.410> we're<00:00:17.190> just<00:00:17.340> going<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.520> grind

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
do that today we're just going to grind

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:27.570 
do that today we're just going to grind
some<00:00:17.880> coffee<00:00:18.119> now

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.580 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.280 

so<00:00:28.580> we've<00:00:28.730> ground<00:00:29.000> our<00:00:29.180> coffee<00:00:29.420> now<00:00:30.140> we're

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:30.290 
so we've ground our coffee now we're

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.920 
so we've ground our coffee now we're
just<00:00:30.470> going<00:00:30.620> to<00:00:30.650> collapse<00:00:30.950> in<00:00:31.190> temp<00:00:31.750> in<00:00:32.750> the

job of grinding dosing and tamping is if

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.940 
job of grinding dosing and tamping is if
you<00:00:56.030> see<00:00:56.239> around<00:00:56.450> about<00:00:56.690> 11<00:00:57.080> or<00:00:57.170> 12<00:00:57.410> seconds<00:00:57.860> on

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:57.950 
you see around about 11 or 12 seconds on

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.920 
you see around about 11 or 12 seconds on
the<00:00:57.980> shot<00:00:58.070> clock<00:00:58.280> before<00:00:58.730> espresso<00:00:59.420> starts<00:00:59.780> to

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
the shot clock before espresso starts to

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.830 
the shot clock before espresso starts to
flow<00:01:00.140> and<00:01:00.880> you<00:01:01.880> can<00:01:02.030> see<00:01:02.240> from<00:01:02.420> the<00:01:02.600> rate<00:01:02.810> of

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
flow and you can see from the rate of

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.109 
flow and you can see from the rate of
flow<00:01:03.080> of<00:01:03.320> the<00:01:03.440> espresso<00:01:03.890> that<00:01:04.580> the<00:01:04.729> pores<00:01:04.970> are

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
flow of the espresso that the pores are

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.150 
flow of the espresso that the pores are
nice<00:01:05.270> and<00:01:05.509> straight<00:01:05.780> the<00:01:06.590> color<00:01:06.830> is<00:01:06.920> quite

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
nice and straight the color is quite

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.240 
nice and straight the color is quite
dark<00:01:07.460> and<00:01:07.700> the<00:01:08.660> flows<00:01:08.900> not<00:01:09.170> running<00:01:09.470> away<00:01:09.590> but

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
dark and the flows not running away but

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.010 
dark and the flows not running away but
it's<00:01:10.400> not<00:01:10.460> choking<00:01:11.030> up<00:01:11.180> and<00:01:11.360> dripping<00:01:11.810> at<00:01:11.900> the

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
it's not choking up and dripping at the

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.020 
it's not choking up and dripping at the
same<00:01:12.259> time<00:01:12.530> so<00:01:13.220> you<00:01:13.280> can<00:01:13.490> see<00:01:13.670> we've<00:01:13.820> done<00:01:14.000> a

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
same time so you can see we've done a

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.430 
same time so you can see we've done a
pretty<00:01:14.090> good<00:01:14.330> job<00:01:14.509> of<00:01:14.720> our<00:01:14.930> dosing<00:01:15.350> and

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
pretty good job of our dosing and

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.469 
pretty good job of our dosing and
tamping<00:01:18.340> so<00:01:19.340> what<00:01:19.490> if<00:01:19.580> your<00:01:19.700> espresso<00:01:19.940> flow<00:01:20.420> is

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
tamping so what if your espresso flow is

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.540 
tamping so what if your espresso flow is
not<00:01:20.720> perfect<00:01:21.170> there's<00:01:21.590> only<00:01:21.740> two<00:01:22.070> elements

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
not perfect there's only two elements

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.760 
not perfect there's only two elements
that<00:01:22.580> can<00:01:22.729> affect<00:01:23.060> it<00:01:23.240> let's<00:01:23.780> see<00:01:23.899> the<00:01:24.050> dose<00:01:24.290> or

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
that can affect it let's see the dose or

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.400 
that can affect it let's see the dose or
grind<00:01:25.100> size<00:01:25.310> I<00:01:25.690> suggest<00:01:26.690> that<00:01:26.750> you<00:01:26.840> focus<00:01:27.110> on

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.410 
grind size I suggest that you focus on

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.380 
grind size I suggest that you focus on
getting<00:01:27.530> the<00:01:27.740> dose<00:01:27.950> right<00:01:28.190> first<00:01:28.520> it's<00:01:29.090> one<00:01:29.300> of

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
getting the dose right first it's one of

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.240 
getting the dose right first it's one of
the<00:01:29.450> most<00:01:29.570> complex<00:01:30.050> elements<00:01:30.289> but<00:01:31.100> it's

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
the most complex elements but it's

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.850 
the most complex elements but it's
pretty<00:01:31.429> easy<00:01:31.670> to<00:01:31.819> solve<00:01:32.289> just<00:01:33.289> make<00:01:33.470> sure<00:01:33.500> that

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
pretty easy to solve just make sure that

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.279 
pretty easy to solve just make sure that
each<00:01:34.039> time<00:01:34.069> you<00:01:34.460> dose<00:01:34.670> your<00:01:34.910> portafilter<00:01:35.289> at

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:36.289 
each time you dose your portafilter at

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:38.260 
each time you dose your portafilter at
the<00:01:36.410> top<00:01:36.619> of<00:01:36.649> the<00:01:36.860> cap<00:01:37.100> that's<00:01:37.580> on<00:01:37.729> the<00:01:37.850> Tampa

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
the top of the cap that's on the Tampa

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.120 
the top of the cap that's on the Tampa
is<00:01:38.810> level<00:01:39.350> with<00:01:39.470> the<00:01:39.530> top<00:01:39.649> of<00:01:39.890> the<00:01:39.950> filter

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
is level with the top of the filter

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.760 
is level with the top of the filter
basket<00:01:40.429> after<00:01:41.360> you've<00:01:41.479> tempt<00:01:41.869> if<00:01:42.350> you<00:01:42.530> hold

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
basket after you've tempt if you hold

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.740 
basket after you've tempt if you hold
that<00:01:42.860> particular<00:01:43.399> reference<00:01:44.030> point<00:01:44.270> every

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
that particular reference point every

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.600 
that particular reference point every
time<00:01:44.959> you<00:01:45.110> dose<00:01:45.319> then<00:01:45.920> you<00:01:46.039> only<00:01:46.280> need<00:01:46.580> to

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
time you dose then you only need to

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.320 
time you dose then you only need to
adjust<00:01:46.819> the<00:01:47.119> grind<00:01:47.360> size

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
adjust the grind size

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.120 
adjust the grind size
so<00:01:50.330> once<00:01:50.510> you've<00:01:50.660> now<00:01:50.840> the<00:01:50.900> DOS<00:01:51.260> all<00:01:51.740> you<00:01:51.980> need

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
so once you've now the DOS all you need

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.100 
so once you've now the DOS all you need
to<00:01:52.220> do<00:01:52.340> is<00:01:52.370> adjust<00:01:52.550> the<00:01:52.880> grind<00:01:53.150> if<00:01:53.930> your

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
to do is adjust the grind if your

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.050 
to do is adjust the grind if your
espresso<00:01:54.320> is<00:01:54.590> flowing<00:01:54.920> too<00:01:55.040> quickly<00:01:55.370> that

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
espresso is flowing too quickly that

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.460 
espresso is flowing too quickly that
means<00:01:56.270> you<00:01:56.390> need<00:01:56.510> to<00:01:56.630> meet<00:01:56.750> the<00:01:56.900> grind<00:01:57.140> finer

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
means you need to meet the grind finer

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.490
