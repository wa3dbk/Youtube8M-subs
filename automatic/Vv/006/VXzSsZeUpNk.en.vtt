00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.630
 hello is the savior of the store of the 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.580
 I'll show you how to create an area 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.700
 of decorative aggregate on the terrace or 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.700
 yard 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.700
 these are the materials that we are going to 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.970
 use 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:27.530
 fat for your easy 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.920
 gloves 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:34.360
 Decorative arid anti-weed mesh kit 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:38.350
 in this case gravel pink volcanic stone 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.350
 and white boulder 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.470
 and these are the tools 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.650
 hoe 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:51.720
 a roller 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:56.250
 nylon hammer rake 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:58.560
 scissors and cutter the advantages of using 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.660
 decorative airs in the garden are his 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.100
 decorative possibilities since there is a 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.559
 great variety that you can combine from 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.270
 various ways saving water you can 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.730
 use alone or combined with 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.100
 xerophilous plants that hardly need 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.060
 water and low maintenance as 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.800
 limit the use of products 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.800
 phytosanitary products are machinery 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.659
 first of all we eliminate all 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.820
 the weeds that are in the ground 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.850
 as it is small we can do it 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.830
 manually or with the help of a hoe is 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.600
 preferable moisten the earth before 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.600
 to facilitate the task 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.890
 then the masters level and what 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.950
 we share well to avoid futures 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.950
 bumps we can use a roller 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.630
 then we put an anti-weed mesh 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.770
 it must be as dark as possible for 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.320
 prevent the entrance of the rays 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.720
 ultraviolet and avoid the output of bad 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.350
 herbs and should allow the entry of 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.350
 rain water 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.440
 Y 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.220
 if necessary we can cut it with 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.220
 scissors or a cutter 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.800
 we fix it with the pegs in the 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.800
 extremes 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.450
 after we limit the terrain 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.830
 with a vegetable that will separate 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.050
 different materials that we go to 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.040
 use if you need to cut it we can 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.500
 use a grinder 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.269
 this metal vegetable allows us to make 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.370
 curves to get a very result 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.349
 decorative we can use as a guide 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.549
 different objects that we have at home 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.549
 like a flower pot 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.420
 all right 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.420
 we can also make right angles 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:59.100
 we present the vegetables on the mesh 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.100
 and we cut it to be able to place them 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.280
 we introduce them to the ground with help 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.280
 of a nylon hammer for not 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.040
 mark them we must not forget to put ourselves 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.110
 protective gloves once placed 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.300
 the vegetables we must ensure the 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.870
 the pegs that serve as a union and 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.870
 subjection 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.130
 we can extend the habit of 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.830
 way that we like in our case 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:45.000
 We are going to use three types of stone aggregate 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.000
 volcanic next to the lawn 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.069
 pink gravel below 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.630
 and inside the circles and the rhombus 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.500
 white pebble so that the 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.870
 composition is even more decorative 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.910
 We extend the material directly with 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.910
 the sack and we distribute it with a rake 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.180
 Y 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.950
 up here our demonstration will 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.870
 We invite you to visit our store 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:41.340
 leroy merlin where you can learn a lot 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.340
 more in the demonstrations classroom
