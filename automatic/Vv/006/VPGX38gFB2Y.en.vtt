thinned out on the pads now I'm gonna go

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.049 
thinned out on the pads now I'm gonna go
ahead<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:31.110> go<00:00:31.560> down<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.860> a-pillars<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.460> don't

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.369 
ahead and go down the a-pillars I don't
want<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.360> go<00:00:33.450> down<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.780> a-pillars<00:00:34.170> with<00:00:34.290> a

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:34.379 
want to go down the a-pillars with a

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:35.990 
want to go down the a-pillars with a
bunch<00:00:34.800> of<00:00:34.950> polish<00:00:35.280> in<00:00:35.400> the<00:00:35.489> past<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.850> what

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
bunch of polish in the past is what

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.760 
bunch of polish in the past is what
that'll<00:00:36.210> do<00:00:36.360> so<00:00:36.900> I'll<00:00:36.960> put<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.140> bunch<00:00:37.350> of<00:00:37.440> polish

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
that'll do so I'll put a bunch of polish

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.869 
that'll do so I'll put a bunch of polish
in<00:00:37.890> here<00:00:38.010> it'll<00:00:38.100> be<00:00:38.160> hard<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.430> get<00:00:38.579> out<00:00:38.670> later

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
in here it'll be hard to get out later

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.970 
in here it'll be hard to get out later
anything<00:00:39.600> you're<00:00:39.720> putting<00:00:39.989> fresh<00:00:40.440> polish<00:00:40.860> on

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
anything you're putting fresh polish on

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.130 
anything you're putting fresh polish on
a<00:00:41.010> pad<00:00:41.250> make<00:00:41.820> sure<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.360> get<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.600> evened

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
a pad make sure that you get it evened

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.840 
a pad make sure that you get it evened
out<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.440> thinned<00:00:43.769> out<00:00:43.949> on<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.190> pad<00:00:44.339> so<00:00:44.820> that

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
out and thinned out on the pad so that

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.369 
out and thinned out on the pad so that
it<00:00:45.059> doesn't<00:00:45.269> fall<00:00:45.540> into<00:00:45.570> nooks<00:00:45.900> and<00:00:46.050> crannies

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
it doesn't fall into nooks and crannies

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.020 
it doesn't fall into nooks and crannies
are<00:00:46.440> required<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.800> take<00:00:46.949> all<00:00:47.460> kinds<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.850> time

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
are required to take all kinds of time

00:00:48.030 --> 00:01:08.860 
are required to take all kinds of time
later<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.360> go<00:00:48.449> out<00:00:48.540> and<00:00:48.690> dig<00:00:49.290> it<00:00:49.410> out

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:08.870 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.170 

now<00:01:09.870> let's<00:01:10.200> see<00:01:10.500> if<00:01:10.770> we<00:01:11.100> were<00:01:11.220> able<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.580> correct

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
now let's see if we were able to correct

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.650 
now let's see if we were able to correct
that<00:01:12.600> with<00:01:13.410> that<00:01:13.620> easy<00:01:13.950> step<00:01:14.510> totally

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:15.660 
that with that easy step totally

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.109 
that with that easy step totally
so<00:01:16.320> we<00:01:16.500> nailed<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:17.010> we<00:01:17.430> didn't<00:01:17.700> need<00:01:17.910> the

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
so we nailed that we didn't need the

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.290 
so we nailed that we didn't need the
heavy<00:01:18.479> duty<00:01:18.780> cutting<00:01:19.590> pads<00:01:19.950> because<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:21.090> is

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
heavy duty cutting pads because this is

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.180 
heavy duty cutting pads because this is
so<00:01:21.510> much<00:01:21.690> softer<00:01:21.960> than<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.470> clear<00:01:22.740> coat<00:01:22.950> on

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
so much softer than the clear coat on

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.640 
so much softer than the clear coat on
the<00:01:23.940> rest<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.270> car<00:01:24.450> so<00:01:24.690> let's<00:01:24.930> see<00:01:25.470> how<00:01:25.590> we

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
the rest of the car so let's see how we

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.420 
the rest of the car so let's see how we
did<00:01:25.800> up<00:01:25.979> here<00:01:26.009> on<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.750> up<00:01:27.750> on<00:01:27.990> this<00:01:28.430> carbon

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
did up here on the up on this carbon

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
did up here on the up on this carbon
fiber<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:33.500> see<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.530> few<00:01:34.860> small<00:01:35.280> marks<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:36.270> what

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
fiber I see a few small marks so what

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.969 
fiber I see a few small marks so what
I'm<00:01:36.570> gonna<00:01:36.690> do<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:37.020> I'm<00:01:37.140> gonna<00:01:37.229> come<00:01:37.470> back<00:01:37.590> over

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna come back over

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
it with the orange foam pads I corrected

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.859 
it with the orange foam pads I corrected
85<00:01:44.130> or<00:01:44.280> 90%<00:01:44.580> of<00:01:44.910> it<00:01:45.030> with<00:01:45.119> just<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.300> white<00:01:45.600> pads

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
85 or 90% of it with just the white pads

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.200 
85 or 90% of it with just the white pads
it's<00:01:46.350> soft<00:01:46.800> if<00:01:47.280> you've<00:01:47.430> got<00:01:47.550> an<00:01:47.640> older<00:01:47.940> car

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
it's soft if you've got an older car

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.060 
it's soft if you've got an older car

hotrods and things like that they'll

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.270 
hotrods and things like that they'll
paint<00:01:51.750> lacquer<00:01:52.020> on<00:01:52.170> those<00:01:52.440> things<00:01:52.680> when

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
get two steps done in one pass watch

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.550 
get two steps done in one pass watch
this<00:02:04.640> pull<00:02:05.640> off<00:02:05.880> one<00:02:06.750> of<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.899> white<00:02:07.050> foam<00:02:07.289> pads

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
this pull off one of the white foam pads

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.970 
this pull off one of the white foam pads
and<00:02:08.360> install<00:02:09.360> one<00:02:09.810> of<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:09.989> orange<00:02:10.380> foam<00:02:10.709> pads

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
and install one of the orange foam pads

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.310 
and install one of the orange foam pads
crazy<00:02:13.980> maybe<00:02:14.940> but<00:02:15.570> I'll<00:02:15.660> tell<00:02:15.870> you<00:02:15.959> what<00:02:16.140> it's

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
crazy maybe but I'll tell you what it's

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.810 
crazy maybe but I'll tell you what it's
a<00:02:16.440> great<00:02:16.799> way<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:16.980> save<00:02:17.250> time<00:02:17.489> and<00:02:17.730> achieve

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
a great way to save time and achieve

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.630 
a great way to save time and achieve
awesome<00:02:18.570> results<00:02:19.019> in<00:02:19.140> one<00:02:19.590> step<00:02:22.489> I'm<00:02:23.489> gonna

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
awesome results in one step I'm gonna

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.370 
awesome results in one step I'm gonna
take<00:02:23.880> first<00:02:24.180> a<00:02:24.480> little<00:02:24.959> bit<00:02:25.049> of<00:02:25.140> paint
