00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.390 
with phenom turian and athlon processors
so<00:01:04.890> let's<00:01:05.129> get<00:01:05.280> in<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.729> be<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.240> judge

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.430 

so<00:01:11.210> let's<00:01:11.420> take<00:01:11.570> a<00:01:11.630> look<00:01:11.900> at<00:01:11.990> one<00:01:12.170> of<00:01:12.200> the<00:01:12.320> most

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
so let's take a look at one of the most

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.470 
so let's take a look at one of the most
important<00:01:13.160> capabilities<00:01:13.940> to<00:01:14.210> the<00:01:14.300> mainstream

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:14.480 
important capabilities to the mainstream

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.190 
important capabilities to the mainstream
consumer<00:01:15.410> and<00:01:15.590> that's<00:01:16.250> the<00:01:16.460> ability<00:01:16.940> to<00:01:17.780> in<00:01:18.110> a

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
consumer and that's the ability to in a

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.400 
consumer and that's the ability to in a
very<00:01:18.410> high<00:01:18.740> quality<00:01:19.160> manner<00:01:19.610> run<00:01:20.570> high

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
very high quality manner run high

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.520 
very high quality manner run high
definition<00:01:22.220> video<00:01:22.720> blu-ray<00:01:23.720> let's<00:01:23.990> say<00:01:24.290> at

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
definition video blu-ray let's say at

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.210 
definition video blu-ray let's say at
1080p<00:01:25.390> capabilities<00:01:26.390> and<00:01:26.570> the<00:01:26.990> RS<00:01:27.320> 780<00:01:27.800> does

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
1080p capabilities and the RS 780 does

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.610 
1080p capabilities and the RS 780 does
that<00:01:28.430> extremely<00:01:29.120> well<00:01:29.570> so<00:01:30.260> we're<00:01:30.440> going<00:01:30.530> to

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
that extremely well so we're going to

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.660 
that extremely well so we're going to
show<00:01:30.860> two<00:01:31.790> scenarios<00:01:32.270> here<00:01:32.780> that<00:01:33.380> users<00:01:33.890> do

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
show two scenarios here that users do

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.760 
show two scenarios here that users do
we're<00:01:35.390> going<00:01:35.480> to<00:01:35.540> show<00:01:35.720> the<00:01:35.900> advantage<00:01:36.470> that

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
we're going to show the advantage that

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.180 
we're going to show the advantage that
our<00:01:37.730> high<00:01:38.300> definition<00:01:38.930> blu-ray<00:01:39.410> playback<00:01:39.740> has

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
our high definition blu-ray playback has

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.160 
our high definition blu-ray playback has
over<00:01:40.550> the<00:01:40.640> competitors<00:01:41.180> so<00:01:41.780> the<00:01:41.870> first<00:01:42.080> thing

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
over the competitors so the first thing

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.020 
over the competitors so the first thing
we're<00:01:42.410> going<00:01:42.500> to<00:01:42.560> look<00:01:42.650> at<00:01:42.920> is<00:01:43.160> playing<00:01:43.880> a

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
we're going to look at is playing a

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.850 
we're going to look at is playing a
video<00:01:44.330> with<00:01:44.720> nothing<00:01:45.200> running<00:01:45.500> in<00:01:45.740> the

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
video with nothing running in the

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.140 
video with nothing running in the
background<00:01:46.040> and<00:01:46.900> you<00:01:47.900> will<00:01:48.020> see<00:01:48.350> that<00:01:48.619> our<00:01:49.550> CPU

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
background and you will see that our CPU

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.570 
background and you will see that our CPU
utilization<00:01:50.270> is<00:01:51.050> a<00:01:51.110> lot<00:01:51.500> lower<00:01:51.740> which<00:01:52.190> gives

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
utilization is a lot lower which gives

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.910 
utilization is a lot lower which gives
you<00:01:52.760> the<00:01:52.910> capability<00:01:53.060> to<00:01:53.810> do<00:01:54.260> something<00:01:54.740> in

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
you the capability to do something in

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.670 
you the capability to do something in
the<00:01:54.950> background<00:01:55.280> at<00:01:55.760> the<00:01:56.060> same<00:01:56.270> time<00:01:56.570> a<00:01:56.840> lot<00:01:57.560> of

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
the background at the same time a lot of

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.200 
the background at the same time a lot of
mainstream<00:01:57.860> users<00:01:58.400> don't<00:01:58.640> even<00:01:58.910> know<00:01:59.180> that

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
mainstream users don't even know that

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.969 
mainstream users don't even know that
they're<00:01:59.690> doing<00:01:59.990> things<00:02:00.200> in<00:02:00.380> the<00:02:00.470> background

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
they're doing things in the background

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.160 
they're doing things in the background
but<00:02:01.460> their<00:02:01.610> computers<00:02:02.060> are<00:02:02.240> doing<00:02:02.660> it<00:02:02.750> things

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
but their computers are doing it things

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.499 
but their computers are doing it things
like<00:02:03.460> converting<00:02:04.460> audio<00:02:05.410> converting<00:02:06.410> video

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
like converting audio converting video

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.110 
like converting audio converting video
Windows<00:02:08.509> Defender<00:02:09.280> even<00:02:10.280> indexing<00:02:10.940> of<00:02:11.030> the

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
Windows Defender even indexing of the

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.300 
Windows Defender even indexing of the
hard<00:02:11.300> drive<00:02:11.570> so<00:02:12.140> it's<00:02:12.320> very<00:02:12.560> important<00:02:13.250> that

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
hard drive so it's very important that

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.970 
hard drive so it's very important that
the<00:02:13.550> CP<00:02:14.000> utilization<00:02:14.690> is<00:02:14.900> low<00:02:14.959> so<00:02:15.590> you<00:02:15.709> can<00:02:15.890> do

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
the CP utilization is low so you can do

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.850 
the CP utilization is low so you can do
a<00:02:16.010> lot<00:02:16.310> of<00:02:16.340> things<00:02:16.640> at<00:02:16.850> the<00:02:16.940> same<00:02:17.120> time<00:02:17.860> now

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
a lot of things at the same time now

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.470 
a lot of things at the same time now
before<00:02:19.220> we<00:02:19.310> get<00:02:19.400> into<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.670> demonstrations<00:02:20.360> I

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
before we get into the demonstrations I

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.840 
before we get into the demonstrations I
want<00:02:20.630> to<00:02:20.690> point<00:02:20.870> out<00:02:21.080> these<00:02:21.500> are<00:02:21.850> similarly

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
want to point out these are similarly

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.140 
want to point out these are similarly
configured<00:02:23.980> mainstream<00:02:24.980> systems<00:02:25.519> at<00:02:25.790> the

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
configured mainstream systems at the

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.330 
configured mainstream systems at the
same<00:02:26.360> price<00:02:26.690> point<00:02:26.989> are<00:02:27.709> the<00:02:27.920> only<00:02:28.040> major

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
same price point are the only major

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.370 
same price point are the only major
difference<00:02:28.489> here<00:02:29.090> is<00:02:29.239> we<00:02:29.750> have<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:29.959> AMD

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
difference here is we have the AMD

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.009 
difference here is we have the AMD
triple<00:02:30.830> core<00:02:31.010> processor<00:02:31.730> but<00:02:32.360> of<00:02:32.510> course<00:02:32.780> we

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
triple core processor but of course we

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.050 
triple core processor but of course we
couldn't<00:02:33.230> compare<00:02:33.650> that<00:02:33.800> to<00:02:33.860> an<00:02:34.489> intel

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
couldn't compare that to an intel

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.640 
couldn't compare that to an intel
comparable<00:02:35.600> because<00:02:35.720> Intel<00:02:36.110> doesn't<00:02:36.230> have<00:02:36.620> a

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
comparable because Intel doesn't have a

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.070 
comparable because Intel doesn't have a
triple<00:02:37.070> core<00:02:37.250> processor<00:02:37.880> as<00:02:38.480> you<00:02:38.690> can<00:02:38.840> see

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
triple core processor as you can see

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.370 
triple core processor as you can see
very<00:02:39.769> equal<00:02:40.130> configurations<00:02:41.080> so<00:02:42.080> what<00:02:42.260> we're

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
very equal configurations so what we're

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
very equal configurations so what we're
looking<00:02:42.650> at<00:02:42.709> right<00:02:42.769> now<00:02:43.040> is<00:02:44.110> crystal-clear

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
looking at right now is crystal-clear

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.160 
looking at right now is crystal-clear
1080p<00:02:46.400> playback<00:02:46.970> of<00:02:47.239> a<00:02:47.690> high-definition

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
blu-ray movie and as you can also see

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.220 
blu-ray movie and as you can also see
the<00:02:52.370> CP<00:02:52.850> utilization<00:02:53.630> is<00:02:53.870> really<00:02:54.799> really<00:02:55.280> low

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
the CP utilization is really really low

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.340 
the CP utilization is really really low
the<00:02:57.230> Intel<00:02:57.620> g35<00:02:58.519> solution<00:02:59.269> the<00:02:59.450> processor<00:03:00.140> is

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
the Intel g35 solution the processor is

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.920 
the Intel g35 solution the processor is
it<00:03:01.040> 80<00:03:01.340> 90<00:03:02.209> sometimes<00:03:02.660> even<00:03:03.220> 99%<00:03:04.690> peaked<00:03:05.690> out

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
it 80 90 sometimes even 99% peaked out

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.789 
it 80 90 sometimes even 99% peaked out
and<00:03:06.560> what<00:03:06.680> you're<00:03:06.830> seeing<00:03:07.040> is<00:03:07.370> stuttering

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
and what you're seeing is stuttering

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:13.120 
and what you're seeing is stuttering
jitter<00:03:09.799> and<00:03:10.220> an<00:03:10.970> overall<00:03:11.299> low<00:03:12.290> video

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
jitter and an overall low video

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.310 
jitter and an overall low video
performance

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.810 

so<00:03:18.320> what<00:03:18.500> we're<00:03:18.620> looking<00:03:18.650> at<00:03:18.950> right<00:03:19.010> now<00:03:19.280> is

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
so what we're looking at right now is

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.960 
so what we're looking at right now is
watching<00:03:20.510> a<00:03:20.600> high-definition<00:03:21.550> blu-ray<00:03:22.550> movie

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
watching a high-definition blu-ray movie

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.540 
watching a high-definition blu-ray movie
