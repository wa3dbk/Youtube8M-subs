00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.299
 hello galera is kdj creator version of 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.340
 marketing academy walls and this 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.610
 video blog here I came to talk about 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.549
 a very cool balcony that several big 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.500
 names of the world will apply in ultra music 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.050
 fest that happened recently there in 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.400
 miami and is one of the largest if not the largest 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:27.840
 electronic music festival of the world 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:31.800
 however virtually all big was 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:36.180
 hardware or text armin of bad 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.320
 afrojack and di eric peeled and pieri 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.690
 many others 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.540
 and I can tell you how the reasonable margin 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.000
 that all of them apply this 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.670
 balcony is the mouse that did that 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.620
 historical trophy there with martin garrigues 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.390
 but before speaking to the balcony he let 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.250
 a background here tell a story 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.640
 before we can better understand the 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.829
 balcony for every day for all of us 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.770
 for me for you for any day of 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.110
 Brazil or the world there are always some 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:10.049
 events that are very important for the 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:12.840
 career are the windows for us 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:17.430
 day to day it is also important that 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:20.189
 People have to do well, but you do. 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.530
 I do not have a very good day and do not do 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.240
 best set of your life will not go either 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.670
 too much hardship in your career 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.939
 Of course, the bigger we are in the 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.640
 djs scale - important events 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.579
 are really relevant because 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.869
 who is starting any party is a 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.659
 opportunity to showcase your work 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.460
 any party an opportunity to open 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.619
 a door to another party 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.570
 since when you are at a level such 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.610
 top world guys 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.700
 there are few festivals in the world that 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.689
 actually has repercussion from the other 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:59.759
 for you to have an idea maybe 60 thousand 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:02.640
 people on the main lane thousand 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.229
 broadcasts of people watching the 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.240
 I live online 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.220
 or better always a few thousand connections 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.770
 because it may be that on every connection 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.010
 had two three people listening 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.349
 together then potentially r 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:20.310
 200 300 thousand people watching live 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:23.790
 the internet and then the echo of the event 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:27.390
 the impact of the event and the seven 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.900
 every dj on social networks on blogs in 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.549
 media is giant too. 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.420
 So to those guys who are already there 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.370
 top 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.549
 few events like ultra music 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.400
 fashion that can help put the 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:43.500
 their career even further or 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.269
 maybe a little down maybe from 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.150
 disappoint some fans and let the 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.340
 press and people in social networks 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.480
 saying the presentation of such has not been 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.359
 so cool 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:59.150
 that's why a presentation 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:03:06.530
 important as this or simply not 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:06.530
 can miss an interesting story the 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.909
 small bars places where only 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:25.199
 more frequent attendees attend 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:28.379
 and simply testing has more grace to 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:30.620
 the public and with a very big show a 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:40.889
 show that will have a great repercussion 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:42.780
 they only use the risk of a joke and the 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:49.139
 first time in an event that is very 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:51.480
 important on stage and he was 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:56.480
 interviewed and at the time they asked 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:04:01.489
 for him to play what his set would be 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.489
 something about this line 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:13.430
 the pumps 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:13.430
 It's good, as the gringos of the day say. 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:21.620
 have applied important as this 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:34.960
 it's not time to invent fashion it's not the time 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.420
 to test a song that you have not yet 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.090
 You know if it will work or not time 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:43.210
 especially if you have a 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.580
 time of 7 too short to play an hour 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.350
 just and that one hour will determine 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.050
 that people will tell you about us 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.610
 next six months 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.500
 so leave to do the tests in the 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.060
 less important parties 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.430
 I'm not saying that at the party. 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.010
 important you should play only top 10 of the 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:03.310
 That's not what I'm talking about . 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:05.590
 play the best of your 7's 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.620
 style the ones you know that 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.540
 works on the track and will bring the 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.290
 result you know you want 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.940
 pass 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.550
 I do not know if it happened to you anymore. 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.080
 I have had several times with me 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.330
 a song that we listen and think 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.460
 our question z 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.250
 I can not wait to play it's going to be too much. 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.230
 and when we get to the track the 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:29.250
 impact is almost 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:32.200
 zero sometimes even empty the track 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.440
 also happens some music sometimes 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.570
 that we hear not give so much ball to 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.490
 cool but not too much and 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:42.250
 when we see another dj play 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:45.250
 track music explodes we think 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.960
 putz I already had this song already could 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.910
 have played a lot of time 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.430
 This happened to me already happened 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.570
 with various jazz and has good friends 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.490
 chances of having happened to you 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:57.220
 also 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:58.990
 then this balcony of the day of the event were 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:03.190
 very important for you 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:05.440
 if it is an event that will determine the 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.750
 next steps the next stages of 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.040
 your career in the next six months 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.870

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:14.470
 people will talk about you 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:17.410
 in the next six months do not invent fashion 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:19.990
