00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:10.090
 and junk food causes brain damage 

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:12.129
 and how to avoid it among the multiple 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.830
 damage to health caused by food 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:16.980
 junk like obesity and depression now 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.880
 you can add brain damage 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.859
 Australian researchers from the 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.450
 University of New South Wales have 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:24.730
 demonstrated that a diet with high 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.830
 content of sugar and fat still short 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.590
 term may impair capacity 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.660
 cognitive brain just one 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.789
 week after feeding rats with 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.890
 junk food scientists 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:38.859
 they found that the animals presented 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.929
 deterioration in memory curiously what 

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:43.569
 same happened with rats whose diet 

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:45.670
 It was healthy but they drank sugar water as 

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:47.649
 If it were soft drinks, 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.620
 results have been published in the 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:52.299
 brain magazine of avior and immunity a 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.370
 Later analysis showed that the 

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:56.289
 animals had certain inflamed 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.899
 brain regions associated with 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:01.089
 spatial memory like the hippocampus the 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.399
 professor margaret morris author of 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.019
 study explains that as well as the food 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.180
 junk causes inflammation in the 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.580
 body also produces changes in the 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.970
 brain which happened even before 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.100
 of rats gaining weight 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.930
 and the speed at which the 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.150
 brain in the wake of a bad diet is 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.070
 surprising an investigation 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.260
 preliminary point that the damage in the 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.780
 rats is not reversible with a diet 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.270
 healthy researchers are currently 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.730
 they struggle to find a way to 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.530
 curb brain inflammation while 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.630
 good nutrition is important to 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.970
 any age seniors who 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.160
 consume junk food could be a 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.850
 greater risk of experiencing a decline 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.650
 mental research however now 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.290
 One study suggests that ingesting 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.420
 diet rich in omega 3 and specifically 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.270
 Fish oil can help 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.250
 reverse this table researchers from 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.290
 the University of Liverpool found 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.240
 that this fatty acid can prevent 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.979
 mentioned negative effects to 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.440
 stimulate the area of ​​the brain that 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.570
 control feeding learning 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.880
 and the memory for the study is 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.710
 They analyzed multiple jobs 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.740
 around the world and they were made 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.930
 models with animals initially the 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.300
 team of scientists wanted to investigate 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.459
 The effect of omega 3 in reducing 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.630
 weight but finally they did not find 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.390
 evidence that you trust 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.940
 this relationship further oil 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.280
 fish the salmon the sardines the 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.250
 flaxseed chia seeds among others 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.500
 they are rich in omega 3 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.540
