00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.510
 very good to all and welcome once 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.490
 more to android news on this occasion os 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.139
 I bring very interesting news from 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.359
 the creation of a phone with charge 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.800
 solar up the google bet on what 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.899
 which is the race for payment through 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.130
 of the smartphone I only remember you 

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:25.289
 that I have a YouTube channel called 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.329
 model henri and that you will have the link of 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.630
 the description so good without more 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:32.789
 procrastination let's start now with android news 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.609
 kyocera will present a terminal with charge 

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:37.019
 solar in the mobile world congress one of 

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:38.699
 the details of the ones we look at most 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:40.949
 users when buying a 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:43.440
 phone is the battery the more 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:45.660
 autonomy better is to say the longer it lasts 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.820
 without charging better for the user but and 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.379
 if there was no need to load it that 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.989
 it is precisely the case of this 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.460
 device that good this prototype that 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.769
 is going to present the technology company 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.329
 Japanese kyocera in this next mobile 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:58.769
 world congress as I said 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.600
 just a prototype but it's a 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.850
 prototype of a device that works 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.960
 with solar charge is to say that it does not 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.329
 no need to plug it into the network 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.189
 electrical or just compose what's 

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:10.320
 a place where the sun reaches the telephone 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.390
 it would be loaded only we do not have more details 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.610
 for the moment we simply know that they have 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.140
 caught a device of your brand and you 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.329
 they have implemented the necessary technology 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.729
 and that is obviously just a prototype 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:22.320
 and it's not going to go to the market but to me 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.479
 I personally find it very interesting 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.490
 because the truth is that everything starts with 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.649
 a prototype and be kyocera works well 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.570
 what is the play does not work well 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.759
 the device is very likely in a 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.469
 near future or not so close we have 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.810
 devices that work with load 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:41.140
 solar which would be ideal for the usual 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.689
 the htc one m 9 plus will be one more version 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.549
 htc one m 9 big but also 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:47.920
 will present other characteristics if 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.299
 differentiate from it the difference 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.810
 main will be to the screen that 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:54.610
 is going to have 52 to 5.5 inches in me 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.110
 opinion, the logical thing is that it is more 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.210
 oriented at 55 to five inches 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.520
 because if not the size will be very 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.880
 similar to htc one the n9 I want 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.310
 remember has 5 inches processor it 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.349
 wait for a qualcomm snapdragon processor 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.420
 810 octa core that is with 8 cores and 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:12.489
 good these eight cores four cuts to 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.590
 1.5 gigahertz and others 4 to 2 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.900
 gigahertz regarding memory 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.090
 Internal therefore will have 32 gigas that 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.069
 You can expand using sd card and 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.530
 is going to have 3 gb of ram that the truth 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.330
 it's pretty good like the 9 the 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.769
 rear camera is not going to have ultra pixel 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.840
 but it will have directly 20 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.760
 megapixels more or less and the camera 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.560
 front is going to have 4 ultra pixels is 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.000
 say to incorporate ultra technology 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.190
 pixel just like the retail that I want 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.260
 remember and the system is going to be 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.790
 exactly the same android 5 points 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.640
 lollipop with 6 7.0 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.280
 google buys soft pay and joins the 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.810
 fight of the payment through the smartphone 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.090
 last week I talked about buying 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.709
 lupe by samsung to compete 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.200
 with apple pay in what is the race 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.209
 because it is really a race of payment 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.099
 through the smartphone as it was 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.599
 wait google has already done its bet and 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:02.150
 has bought a company called 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.920
 softcard is a small company of 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.549
 payments and will use it to reinforce 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.750
 google wallet and the truth is that this 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.219
 way will you try to compete with 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.439
 samsung and apple but it has been marked a 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:14.659
 major objective no more than a goal in 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:16.609
 my rather ambitious opinion has been 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:18.769
 put as an objective that all 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:21.530
 Android phones come by default with 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.730
 the google wallet app and the 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.019
 truth is that if they get this 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.150
 It is obviously going to make them a great 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:28.310
 well but at the moment they are striving 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.319
 for getting such a thing they have talked to 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.349
 American mobile phone companies 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:35.599
 such as olive oil and t-mobile and 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.310
 these three companies are going to incorporate the 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:39.709
 google wallet application by default 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.329
 in their devices and the truth is that 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.669
 is the payment through the smartphone is 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:45.560
 is turning into a career one that 

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:46.700
 all companies want to win 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.650
 the truth is that whoever wins it goes to 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.180
 have great benefits since I do not 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.250
 you're going to deny that you go to a restaurant and 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.660
 pay with the phone in less than two 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.489
 minutes is a pretty form of payment 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.110
 comfortable but good for now we will have 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.150
 to see how it develops what it is 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.920
 this race and see what company wins 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.599
 at the moment we have samsung we have a 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.310
 apple we have google but we have 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:06.860
 many more small businesses that also 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.390
 they want to join this race the news 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.370
 what has most caught my attention is the 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.080
 first of all the kyocera goes to 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.180
 present a prototype of a device 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.430
 which charges with solar energy for this 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.500
 mobile world congress and good has called 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.389
 a lot of my attention because I think something 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.950
 pretty new no I had never heard 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.720
 talk about a phone that will carry 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.010
 solar energy and even a prototype 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.620
 I think it's a pretty advance 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.389
 considerable and following if the prototype 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.850
 It goes well and companies start 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:33.020
 take this seriously from the solar charge 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.850
 of the devices and they start to 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.430
 investigate I think you look pretty 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.950
 future and that in the future maybe not so 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.360
 far as you can imagine we can 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.220
 have a device that is loaded with 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.020
 solar energy imagine they have a 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.490
 phone that did not need to load 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.500
 that you simply put it near the sun 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.289
 and that loading is just a pretty idea 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.280
 good thing is that I think it's going to 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:54.920
 start to develop 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.230
 of not much failed or not the prototype of 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.520
 kyocera but well this has been all already 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.560
 you know that you are all invited to 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.970
 comment and write comments what 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.250
 news is calling more yours 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.169
 attention and why and good I hope that you 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.090
 have liked and interested you and that 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:09.530
 have you learned something this has been all 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.910
 for this week and see you in the 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.910
 next Sunday with more news 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.430
 and 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 Y 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.360
 and
