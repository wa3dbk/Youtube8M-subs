hey<00:00:06.690> we've<00:00:07.230> been<00:00:07.259> having<00:00:07.649> some<00:00:07.770> conversations

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
hey we've been having some conversations

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.720 
hey we've been having some conversations
about<00:00:09.559> turnover<00:00:10.559> and<00:00:10.740> one<00:00:11.040> of<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.190> key<00:00:11.370> things

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
about turnover and one of the key things

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.339 
about turnover and one of the key things
that<00:00:11.880> we<00:00:11.969> tend<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.330> see<00:00:12.420> with<00:00:12.570> people<00:00:12.870> when

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
that we tend to see with people when

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.580 
that we tend to see with people when
they<00:00:13.440> start<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:14.130> break<00:00:14.969> down<00:00:15.000> is<00:00:15.540> that<00:00:16.410> that

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
they start to break down is that that

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.620 
they start to break down is that that
turnover<00:00:17.250> starts<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:17.850> slow<00:00:18.119> down<00:00:18.300> so<00:00:18.539> we're

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
turnover starts to slow down so we're

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.480 
turnover starts to slow down so we're
stepping<00:00:18.869> outside<00:00:19.170> of<00:00:19.500> not<00:00:19.859> only<00:00:20.070> that<00:00:20.189> level

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
stepping outside of not only that level

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.740 
stepping outside of not only that level
of<00:00:20.580> skill<00:00:20.820> but<00:00:21.060> we<00:00:21.150> find<00:00:21.420> out<00:00:21.539> where<00:00:21.720> that

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
of skill but we find out where that

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.439 
of skill but we find out where that
fatigue<00:00:22.199> really<00:00:22.590> comes<00:00:23.519> on<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.090> we<00:00:24.119> start<00:00:24.359> to

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
fatigue really comes on and we start to

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.500 
fatigue really comes on and we start to
shut<00:00:24.689> down<00:00:24.830> so<00:00:25.830> within<00:00:26.130> our<00:00:26.310> seminars<00:00:26.910> what<00:00:27.359> we

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
back it down thirdly in between these

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.430 
back it down thirdly in between these
what<00:02:25.730> we<00:02:25.790> want<00:02:25.970> to<00:02:26.030> do<00:02:26.180> is<00:02:26.330> toss<00:02:26.750> in<00:02:27.080> one<00:02:27.350> of

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
what we want to do is toss in one of

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.760 
what we want to do is toss in one of
these<00:02:27.530> drills<00:02:28.210> that<00:02:29.230> potentially<00:02:30.230> makes<00:02:30.440> you

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
these drills that potentially makes you

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.650 
these drills that potentially makes you
understand<00:02:31.580> things<00:02:31.850> a<00:02:31.970> lot<00:02:32.180> better<00:02:32.450> that's

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
understand things a lot better that's

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.510 
understand things a lot better that's
why<00:02:32.810> we<00:02:32.930> do<00:02:33.050> a<00:02:33.080> lot<00:02:33.470> of<00:02:33.680> different<00:02:33.950> drills<00:02:34.100> so

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
why we do a lot of different drills so

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.610 
why we do a lot of different drills so
because<00:02:34.820> a<00:02:34.850> lot<00:02:35.120> of<00:02:35.150> people<00:02:35.360> perceive<00:02:36.110> or

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
because a lot of people perceive or

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.260 
because a lot of people perceive or
catch<00:02:36.950> on<00:02:37.190> to<00:02:37.400> different<00:02:37.670> drills<00:02:38.060> to

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
catch on to different drills to

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.850 
catch on to different drills to
understand<00:02:38.750> get<00:02:38.990> the<00:02:39.080> understanding<00:02:39.680> of<00:02:39.740> how

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
understand get the understanding of how

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.080 
understand get the understanding of how
they<00:02:40.010> should<00:02:40.070> move<00:02:40.220> better

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
they should move better

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.150 
they should move better
so<00:02:41.660> toss<00:02:42.020> it<00:02:42.200> drill<00:02:42.380> in<00:02:42.560> between<00:02:42.830> one<00:02:43.010> of<00:02:43.040> these

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
so toss it drill in between one of these

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.580 
so toss it drill in between one of these
recover<00:02:43.730> let<00:02:44.360> yourself<00:02:44.750> recover<00:02:45.080> doesn't

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
recover let yourself recover doesn't

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.110 
recover let yourself recover doesn't
matter<00:02:45.709> how<00:02:45.920> long<00:02:46.160> doesn't<00:02:46.550> matter<00:02:46.730> how<00:02:46.850> short

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
matter how long doesn't matter how short

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.880 
matter how long doesn't matter how short
just<00:02:47.360> as<00:02:47.450> long<00:02:47.600> as<00:02:47.720> you<00:02:47.780> were<00:02:47.870> covering<00:02:48.200> up<00:02:48.380> so

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
just as long as you were covering up so

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.340 
just as long as you were covering up so
that<00:02:49.010> your<00:02:49.160> body<00:02:49.370> can<00:02:49.660> reset<00:02:50.660> itself<00:02:50.959> and<00:02:51.230> get

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
that your body can reset itself and get

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.160 
that your body can reset itself and get
back<00:02:51.530> to<00:02:51.709> what<00:02:51.860> we<00:02:51.890> want<00:02:52.130> to<00:02:52.220> do<00:02:52.340> fourth<00:02:53.209> we're

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
back to what we want to do fourth we're

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.840 
back to what we want to do fourth we're
gonna<00:02:54.260> kick<00:02:54.500> it<00:02:54.530> out<00:02:54.680> a<00:02:54.740> little<00:02:54.950> bit<00:02:55.100> longer<00:02:55.340> so

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
gonna kick it out a little bit longer so

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.340 
gonna kick it out a little bit longer so
we're<00:02:56.180> gonna<00:02:56.270> go<00:02:56.420> four<00:02:56.690> of<00:02:56.810> these<00:02:56.959> they<00:02:57.260> were

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
we're gonna go four of these they were

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:58.630 
we're gonna go four of these they were
drilling<00:02:57.590> between<00:02:57.980> all<00:02:58.130> of<00:02:58.310> them<00:02:58.430> and<00:02:58.550> then

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
drilling between all of them and then

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.880 
drilling between all of them and then
the<00:02:58.790> end<00:02:58.940> of<00:02:59.000> this<00:02:59.120> thing<00:02:59.330> we're<00:02:59.930> gonna<00:03:00.080> go<00:03:00.350> and

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
the end of this thing we're gonna go and

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.770 
the end of this thing we're gonna go and
go<00:03:01.130> for<00:03:01.430> two<00:03:01.670> minutes<00:03:02.030> and<00:03:02.209> you're<00:03:02.360> gonna<00:03:02.450> drop

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
go for two minutes and you're gonna drop

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.170 
go for two minutes and you're gonna drop
that<00:03:02.840> cadence<00:03:03.680> down<00:03:04.640> to<00:03:05.420> about<00:03:05.630> 91<00:03:06.470> so<00:03:07.430> why<00:03:08.120> are

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
that cadence down to about 91 so why are

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.330 
that cadence down to about 91 so why are
we<00:03:08.420> sticking<00:03:08.690> like<00:03:09.050> in<00:03:09.230> this<00:03:09.350> 90<00:03:09.830> range<00:03:10.040> here

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
we sticking like in this 90 range here

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.920 
we sticking like in this 90 range here
because<00:03:10.550> the<00:03:10.670> fact<00:03:10.910> is<00:03:11.209> is<00:03:11.480> that<00:03:11.600> anything

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
because the fact is is that anything

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.550 
because the fact is is that anything
really<00:03:12.350> under<00:03:12.770> a<00:03:12.800> 90<00:03:13.520> cadence<00:03:14.300> really<00:03:15.230> doesn't

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
really under a 90 cadence really doesn't

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.410 
really under a 90 cadence really doesn't
use<00:03:15.739> that<00:03:15.980> muscle<00:03:16.190> tendon<00:03:16.640> elasticity<00:03:17.360> and

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
use that muscle tendon elasticity and

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.970 
use that muscle tendon elasticity and
there's<00:03:17.570> not<00:03:17.720> a<00:03:17.780> whole<00:03:17.900> lot<00:03:18.050> of<00:03:18.290> efficiency<00:03:18.890> in

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
there's not a whole lot of efficiency in

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.009 
there's not a whole lot of efficiency in
it<00:03:19.100> it<00:03:19.250> involves<00:03:20.060> a<00:03:20.239> lot<00:03:20.480> more<00:03:20.540> muscle

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
it it involves a lot more muscle

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:22.930 
it it involves a lot more muscle
contraction<00:03:21.590> if<00:03:21.709> you<00:03:21.830> don't<00:03:22.160> believe<00:03:22.519> me<00:03:22.790> on

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
contraction if you don't believe me on

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
that go set your tempo trainer or your

that go set your tempo trainer or your
little<00:03:25.910> metronome<00:03:26.450> to<00:03:26.630> 90<00:03:27.080> and<00:03:27.110> try<00:03:27.530> and<00:03:27.709> jump

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
little metronome to 90 and try and jump

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.430 
little metronome to 90 and try and jump
rope<00:03:28.160> at<00:03:28.400> that<00:03:28.580> or<00:03:28.910> even<00:03:29.660> try<00:03:29.870> and<00:03:29.930> do<00:03:30.170> some

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
rope at that or even try and do some

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.550 
rope at that or even try and do some
mini<00:03:30.650> box<00:03:30.950> jumps<00:03:31.400> not<00:03:31.610> too<00:03:31.820> many<00:03:32.030> but<00:03:32.840> try<00:03:33.500> and

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
mini box jumps not too many but try and

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.320 
mini box jumps not too many but try and
do<00:03:33.650> it<00:03:33.769> at<00:03:33.860> a<00:03:33.920> 90<00:03:34.250> cadence<00:03:34.610> you're<00:03:34.850> gonna<00:03:34.970> find

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
do it at a 90 cadence you're gonna find

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.449 
do it at a 90 cadence you're gonna find
out<00:03:35.540> that<00:03:35.750> it's<00:03:35.900> actually<00:03:36.110> pretty<00:03:36.620> slow<00:03:36.920> okay

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
out that it's actually pretty slow okay

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.199 
out that it's actually pretty slow okay
so<00:03:38.350> we<00:03:39.350> want<00:03:39.680> to<00:03:39.860> use<00:03:40.070> those<00:03:40.250> products

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
so we want to use those products

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:42.970 
so we want to use those products
principles<00:03:41.810> of<00:03:41.959> using<00:03:42.170> muscle<00:03:42.650> tendon

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
principles of using muscle tendon

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.650 
principles of using muscle tendon
elasticity<00:03:43.580> and<00:03:43.730> start<00:03:43.910> to<00:03:44.000> ingrain<00:03:44.390> that

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
elasticity and start to ingrain that

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.390 
elasticity and start to ingrain that

firing<00:03:46.880> a<00:03:46.940> little<00:03:47.120> bit<00:03:47.239> quicker<00:03:47.480> yes<00:03:47.840> for<00:03:48.500> a

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
firing a little bit quicker yes for a

firing a little bit quicker yes for a
lot<00:03:48.830> of<00:03:48.980> us<00:03:49.070> this<00:03:49.190> is<00:03:49.250> going<00:03:49.430> to<00:03:49.549> require<00:03:49.910> a

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
lot of us this is going to require a

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.940 
lot of us this is going to require a
little<00:03:50.269> bit<00:03:50.450> more<00:03:50.570> cardio<00:03:51.200> for<00:03:51.500> some<00:03:51.709> of<00:03:51.799> you

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
little bit more cardio for some of you

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.979 
little bit more cardio for some of you
who<00:03:52.400> are<00:03:52.430> higher<00:03:52.760> level<00:03:53.150> this<00:03:53.269> is<00:03:53.330> not<00:03:53.660> going

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
who are higher level this is not going

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.740 
who are higher level this is not going
to<00:03:54.080> be<00:03:54.440> that<00:03:54.620> difficult<00:03:55.160> okay<00:03:55.700> but<00:03:56.390> as<00:03:56.630> we

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
to be that difficult okay but as we

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.330 
to be that difficult okay but as we
progress<00:03:56.900> in<00:03:57.260> the<00:03:57.320> next<00:03:57.560> six<00:03:57.739> weeks<00:03:57.860> we<00:03:58.010> will

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
progress in the next six weeks we will

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.130 
progress in the next six weeks we will
see<00:03:58.610> these<00:03:58.880> changes<00:03:59.420> start<00:03:59.660> to<00:03:59.750> occur<00:03:59.989> and

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
see these changes start to occur and

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.960 
see these changes start to occur and
your<00:04:00.260> body<00:04:00.440> will<00:04:00.650> start<00:04:01.010> to<00:04:01.190> adapt<00:04:01.580> to<00:04:01.610> these

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
your body will start to adapt to these

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.670 
your body will start to adapt to these
things<00:04:02.269> so<00:04:02.660> you<00:04:02.959> go<00:04:03.140> through<00:04:03.440> this<00:04:03.620> whole

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
things so you go through this whole

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.699 
things so you go through this whole
thing<00:04:04.220> like<00:04:04.940> this<00:04:05.209> and<00:04:05.540> then<00:04:06.110> once<00:04:06.320> we've<00:04:06.500> gone

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
thing like this and then once we've gone

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.590 
thing like this and then once we've gone
through<00:04:07.100> here<00:04:07.489> we're<00:04:07.970> going<00:04:08.090> to<00:04:08.150> do<00:04:08.269> is<00:04:08.390> take

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
through here we're going to do is take

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.990 
through here we're going to do is take
it<00:04:08.630> right<00:04:09.019> back<00:04:09.230> up<00:04:09.470> to<00:04:09.650> two<00:04:09.860> again<00:04:10.190> and<00:04:10.459> you're

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
it right back up to two again and you're

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.870 
it right back up to two again and you're
going<00:04:11.150> to<00:04:11.180> repeat<00:04:11.570> it<00:04:11.660> for<00:04:11.840> a<00:04:11.870> second<00:04:12.260> round<00:04:12.380> so

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
going to repeat it for a second round so

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.680 
going to repeat it for a second round so
go<00:04:13.270> two<00:04:13.630> rounds<00:04:14.080> of<00:04:14.140> this<00:04:14.460> okay<00:04:15.790> start<00:04:16.540> with

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
go two rounds of this okay start with

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.810 
go two rounds of this okay start with
the<00:04:16.780> drills<00:04:17.020> the<00:04:17.200> beginning<00:04:17.650> go<00:04:18.520> two<00:04:18.580> three
