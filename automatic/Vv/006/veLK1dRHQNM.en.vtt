00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
tips for my fans getting to Cheltenham I

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.179 
tips for my fans getting to Cheltenham I
think<00:01:05.409> obviously<00:01:05.560> try<00:01:05.860> and<00:01:05.950> get<00:01:06.040> there<00:01:06.159> early

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:06.189

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:08.700 
think obviously try and get there early
it's<00:01:06.579> yeah<00:01:06.880> it's<00:01:07.149> very<00:01:07.329> very<00:01:07.539> busy<00:01:07.719> roads<00:01:08.560> are

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
it's yeah it's very very busy roads are

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.770 
it's yeah it's very very busy roads are
usually<00:01:08.950> gridlocked<00:01:09.340> so<00:01:10.030> I<00:01:10.060> think<00:01:10.149> you<00:01:10.689> know

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
usually gridlocked so I think you know

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.179 
usually gridlocked so I think you know
probably<00:01:10.960> the<00:01:11.109> best<00:01:11.229> ways<00:01:11.380> to<00:01:11.409> try<00:01:11.829> and<00:01:11.950> travel

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:12.189 
probably the best ways to try and travel

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:14.550 
probably the best ways to try and travel
by<00:01:12.280> train<00:01:12.490> if<00:01:12.670> possible<00:01:13.320> cross-country<00:01:14.320> have

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
by train if possible cross-country have

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.469 
by train if possible cross-country have
94<00:01:14.950> stops<00:01:15.280> that<00:01:15.460> stop<00:01:15.729> at<00:01:15.850> Cheltenham<00:01:16.210> so

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
94 stops that stop at Cheltenham so

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.080 
94 stops that stop at Cheltenham so

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
doing anything differently really it's

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.690 
doing anything differently really it's
just<00:01:25.899> you<00:01:26.200> know<00:01:26.320> potluck<00:01:26.679> you<00:01:26.799> know<00:01:26.920> last<00:01:27.609> year

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700

having<00:02:48.760> a<00:02:48.790> fan<00:02:48.940> base<00:02:49.090> i<00:02:49.209> think<00:02:49.359> is<00:02:49.450> great<00:02:49.569> i

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
having a fan base i think is great i

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.089 
having a fan base i think is great i
don't<00:02:50.019> think<00:02:50.049> it<00:02:50.230> puts<00:02:50.319> pressure<00:02:50.500> on<00:02:50.709> me<00:02:50.920> a

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
don't think it puts pressure on me a

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:52.440 
don't think it puts pressure on me a
little<00:02:51.489> bit<00:02:51.639> of<00:02:51.760> pressure<00:02:51.909> as<00:02:52.060> a<00:02:52.150> good<00:02:52.299> thing

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
little bit of pressure as a good thing

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.879 
little bit of pressure as a good thing
as<00:02:52.569> well<00:02:52.720> just<00:02:52.959> helps<00:02:53.260> to<00:02:53.319> ride<00:02:53.500> that<00:02:53.530> bit

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:53.889 
as well just helps to ride that bit

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:55.140 
as well just helps to ride that bit
better<00:02:54.099> and<00:02:54.370> makes<00:02:54.579> you<00:02:54.639> concentrate<00:02:54.940> a

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
better and makes you concentrate a

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.670 
better and makes you concentrate a
little<00:02:55.299> bit<00:02:55.540> better<00:02:55.659> and<00:02:55.900> keep<00:02:56.440> you<00:02:56.530> a<00:02:56.560> bit

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
little bit better and keep you a bit

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.830 
little bit better and keep you a bit
more<00:02:56.709> focused<00:02:57.250> so<00:02:57.579> i<00:02:58.030> think<00:02:58.450> it's<00:02:58.629> a<00:02:58.720> good

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
more focused so i think it's a good

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.110 
more focused so i think it's a good
thing<00:02:58.989> and<00:02:59.310> you<00:03:00.310> know<00:03:00.340> you<00:03:00.489> only<00:03:00.549> put<00:03:00.819> as<00:03:00.939> much

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
thing and you know you only put as much

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.149 
thing and you know you only put as much
pressure<00:03:01.180> on<00:03:01.480> yourself<00:03:01.629> as<00:03:02.019> you<00:03:02.349> know<00:03:02.470> you<00:03:02.530> do

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:03.159 
pressure on yourself as you know you do

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:04.949 
pressure on yourself as you know you do
