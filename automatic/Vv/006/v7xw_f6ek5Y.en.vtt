00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
hanging out in the chat room for quite a

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.370 
hanging out in the chat room for quite a
while<00:00:19.910> because<00:00:20.119> yes<00:00:20.450> they<00:00:20.689> happen<00:00:21.290> to<00:00:21.320> be

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380

30-inch<00:00:21.920> monitors<00:00:22.400> each<00:00:22.640> and<00:00:23.590> some<00:00:24.590> would

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
30-inch monitors each and some would

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.890 
30-inch monitors each and some would
consider<00:00:25.100> them<00:00:25.449> widescreen<00:00:26.449> although<00:00:26.869> I

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
consider them widescreen although I

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.810 
consider them widescreen although I
think<00:00:27.020> the<00:00:27.260> aspect<00:00:27.650> ratio<00:00:27.710> on<00:00:28.369> these

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
think the aspect ratio on these

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.519 
think the aspect ratio on these
particular<00:00:29.000> monitors<00:00:29.600> are<00:00:29.779> closer<00:00:30.020> to<00:00:30.350> the

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
particular monitors are closer to the

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.420 
particular monitors are closer to the

nine or some type of wider aspect ratio

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.559 
nine or some type of wider aspect ratio
then<00:01:54.799> maybe<00:01:55.310> I'd<00:01:55.549> be<00:01:55.700> more<00:01:55.729> inclined<00:01:56.270> to<00:01:56.390> like

00:01:56.559 --> 00:01:56.569 
then maybe I'd be more inclined to like

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:59.279 
then maybe I'd be more inclined to like
widescreen<00:01:57.079> applications<00:01:58.179> unfortunately

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
widescreen applications unfortunately

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:03.459 
widescreen applications unfortunately
I've<00:02:00.289> always<00:02:00.890> appreciated<00:02:01.630> Heights<00:02:02.630> rather

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
I've always appreciated Heights rather

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:06.190 
I've always appreciated Heights rather
than<00:02:03.710> width<00:02:04.060> and<00:02:05.060> even<00:02:05.659> people<00:02:05.960> who<00:02:06.020> like

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
than width and even people who like

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.080 
than width and even people who like
webpages<00:02:06.679> I<00:02:06.920> mean<00:02:07.039> I<00:02:07.069> don't<00:02:07.189> even<00:02:07.369> pull<00:02:07.880> my

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
webpages I mean I don't even pull my

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.870 
webpages I mean I don't even pull my
browser<00:02:08.360> up<00:02:08.630> full<00:02:08.840> screen<00:02:09.080> but<00:02:09.410> people<00:02:10.399> even

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
browser up full screen but people even

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.150 
browser up full screen but people even
have<00:02:11.210> double<00:02:11.750> the<00:02:11.870> height<00:02:12.050> of<00:02:12.380> web<00:02:12.920> pages

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
have double the height of web pages

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.520 
have double the height of web pages
since<00:02:13.489> most<00:02:13.700> web<00:02:13.909> pages<00:02:13.940> scroll<00:02:14.690> vertically

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
since most web pages scroll vertically

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.610 
since most web pages scroll vertically
rather<00:02:16.099> than<00:02:16.310> horizontally

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
rather than horizontally

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.350 
rather than horizontally
so<00:02:17.890> if<00:02:18.010> you<00:02:18.069> do<00:02:18.190> a<00:02:18.220> lot<00:02:18.430> of<00:02:18.459> web<00:02:18.700> browsing<00:02:18.970> I

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
so if you do a lot of web browsing I

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.240 
so if you do a lot of web browsing I
don't<00:02:19.750> imagine<00:02:20.110> a<00:02:20.410> widescreen<00:02:20.740> monitors

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
don't imagine a widescreen monitors

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.010 
don't imagine a widescreen monitors

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.100 
used to an aspect ratio that included
well<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.260> resolution<00:02:47.380> was<00:02:48.330> 1600<00:02:49.330> pixels<00:02:49.930> wide

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
well the resolution was 1600 pixels wide

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.680

by 1200 pixels tall and this other
monitor<00:02:53.470> was<00:02:53.739> only<00:02:54.100> something<00:02:54.519> like<00:02:55.019> 1024

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019

monitor was only something like 1024
pixels<00:02:56.320> tall<00:02:56.470> so<00:02:56.680> I<00:02:56.709> was<00:02:56.890> losing<00:02:58.019> space<00:02:59.019> at<00:02:59.260> the

you look at it on either side and height

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.710 
you look at it on either side and height
I<00:03:02.590> was<00:03:02.860> missing<00:03:03.100> like<00:03:03.220> 200<00:03:03.580> pixels<00:03:03.970> and<00:03:04.480> it<00:03:04.600> was

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
I was missing like 200 pixels and it was

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.210 
I was missing like 200 pixels and it was

I'm gonna go on record by saying this I

I'm gonna go on record by saying this I
do<00:03:25.660> not<00:03:25.989> like<00:03:26.290> widescreen<00:03:27.070> aspect<00:03:27.489> ratio<00:03:27.850> at

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
do not like widescreen aspect ratio at

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.780 
do not like widescreen aspect ratio at
least<00:03:28.870> for<00:03:29.290> computer<00:03:30.190> monitors<00:03:30.549> at<00:03:30.670> this

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
least for computer monitors at this

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.140 
least for computer monitors at this
point<00:03:31.090> largely<00:03:31.750> because<00:03:32.140> I<00:03:32.410> think<00:03:33.030> the<00:03:34.030> way

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
point largely because I think the way

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.789 
point largely because I think the way
that<00:03:34.180> I<00:03:34.510> work<00:03:34.810> and<00:03:35.049> the<00:03:35.110> way<00:03:35.200> I<00:03:35.230> handle<00:03:35.709> things

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
that I work and the way I handle things

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.319 
that I work and the way I handle things
I<00:03:35.920> mean<00:03:36.010> I've<00:03:36.160> granted<00:03:36.549> I<00:03:36.730> have<00:03:36.880> two<00:03:37.090> monitors

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
I mean I've granted I have two monitors

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:38.580 
I mean I've granted I have two monitors
so<00:03:37.660> that<00:03:37.810> kind<00:03:37.989> of<00:03:38.019> takes<00:03:38.230> care<00:03:38.290> of<00:03:38.470> the

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
so that kind of takes care of the

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.009 
so that kind of takes care of the
widescreen<00:03:38.920> aspect<00:03:39.310> for<00:03:39.760> me<00:03:39.820> I<00:03:40.090> don't<00:03:40.660> watch<00:03:40.840> a

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
widescreen aspect for me I don't watch a

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.100 
widescreen aspect for me I don't watch a
