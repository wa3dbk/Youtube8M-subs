about this according to the report these
four<00:00:34.020> boundaries<00:00:34.320> that<00:00:34.469> we've<00:00:34.620> already<00:00:34.829> raced

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
four boundaries that we've already raced

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.260 
four boundaries that we've already raced
past<00:00:35.520> what<00:00:35.730> are<00:00:35.850> those

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
past what are those

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.470 
past what are those
well<00:00:36.800> species<00:00:37.800> extinction<00:00:39.230> climate<00:00:40.230> change

I'm<00:00:42.480> forgetting<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.809> other<00:00:42.899> two<00:00:43.170> offhand

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
I'm forgetting the other two offhand

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.139 
I'm forgetting the other two offhand
there's<00:00:43.829> nine<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.190> are<00:00:44.309> listed<00:00:44.489> right<00:00:44.940> and

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
there's nine that are listed right and

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.520 
there's nine that are listed right and
all<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.559> them<00:00:46.739> are<00:00:47.030> discussed<00:00:48.030> as<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:49.110> grave

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
all of them are discussed as of grave

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.160 
all of them are discussed as of grave
concern<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:50.780> you'll<00:00:51.780> get<00:00:51.989> different

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
concern and you'll get different

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.630 
concern and you'll get different
scientists<00:00:52.920> who<00:00:53.010> are<00:00:53.100> saying<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.520> we've

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
scientists who are saying that we've

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.610 
scientists who are saying that we've
already<00:00:53.820> passed<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.719> planetary<00:00:55.289> boundaries

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
already passed the planetary boundaries

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.670 
already passed the planetary boundaries
on<00:00:55.860> more<00:00:56.670> than<00:00:56.940> more<00:00:57.899> than<00:00:57.930> four<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.410> them<00:00:58.559> even

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
on more than more than four of them even

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.860 
on more than more than four of them even
okay<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.850> those<00:01:00.030> first<00:01:00.510> four<00:01:00.750> and

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
okay so of those first four and

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.020 
okay so of those first four and
obviously<00:01:01.260> climate<00:01:01.620> change<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:02.489> probably<00:01:02.969> a

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
obviously climate change is probably a

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.039 
obviously climate change is probably a
big<00:01:03.210> one<00:01:03.329> that<00:01:03.449> most<00:01:03.570> people<00:01:03.899> would<00:01:04.019> be

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
big one that most people would be

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.950 
big one that most people would be
familiar<00:01:04.680> with<00:01:04.830> in<00:01:05.820> terms<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.450> some<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.869> these

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
familiar with in terms of some of these

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.060 
familiar with in terms of some of these
others<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.380> know<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.590> extinction<00:01:08.010> of

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
others you know the extinction of

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.789 
others you know the extinction of
species<00:01:08.310> are<00:01:09.000> we<00:01:09.180> seen<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:10.350> picking<00:01:10.680> up

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
species are we seen that picking up

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.679 
species are we seen that picking up
speed<00:01:10.950> at<00:01:11.850> this<00:01:12.030> point<00:01:12.270> or<00:01:12.390> are<00:01:12.479> we<00:01:12.600> actually

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
speed at this point or are we actually

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:13.929 
speed at this point or are we actually
slowing<00:01:13.049> down<00:01:13.229> on<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.530> we're<00:01:13.710> absolutely

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:13.939 
slowing down on it we're absolutely

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:16.399 
slowing down on it we're absolutely
accelerating<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.090> extinction<00:01:15.689> crisis<00:01:16.200> this

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
accelerating that extinction crisis this

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.780 
accelerating that extinction crisis this
is<00:01:16.470> actually<00:01:16.770> what<00:01:16.890> led<00:01:17.040> me<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.280> get<00:01:17.369> involved

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
is actually what led me to get involved

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.190 
is actually what led me to get involved
with<00:01:17.939> environmental<00:01:18.299> studies<00:01:18.810> in<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:18.990> first

massive species extinction and I'm not
one<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.280> just<00:01:26.549> takes<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:26.939> face<00:01:27.119> value<00:01:27.150> the

one that just takes it face value the

one that just takes it face value the
first<00:01:27.810> claim<00:01:28.110> made<00:01:28.380> by<00:01:28.560> scientists<00:01:29.420> but<00:01:30.420> what

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
first claim made by scientists but what

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.450 
first claim made by scientists but what
I<00:01:30.600> saw<00:01:30.900> what<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.079> began<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.439> do<00:01:31.710> is<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:31.950> take<00:01:32.130> the

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
I saw what I began to do is to take the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.460 
I saw what I began to do is to take the

out that you're pointing to but you take

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.749 
out that you're pointing to but you take
a<00:01:51.540> cumulative<00:01:52.229> look<00:01:52.649> at<00:01:52.829> studies<00:01:53.250> over<00:01:53.520> time

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
more and more direct and now they're

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.180 
more and more direct and now they're
doing<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.930> equivalent<00:02:28.470> of<00:02:28.590> standing<00:02:28.710> on<00:02:29.100> the

ask you this um this you call this the

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.150 
ask you this um this you call this the
sixth<00:04:33.180> great<00:04:33.720> extinction<00:04:34.260> right<00:04:34.740> the<00:04:34.919> first

sixth great extinction right the first

previous great extinctions is this not I

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.320 
previous great extinctions is this not I
guess<00:04:41.790> a<00:04:41.820> part<00:04:42.450> of<00:04:42.570> the<00:04:42.690> you<00:04:43.050> know<00:04:43.490> process<00:04:44.490> for

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
guess a part of the you know process for

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.020 
guess a part of the you know process for
the<00:04:45.450> earth<00:04:45.600> why<00:04:45.930> in<00:04:46.410> this<00:04:46.710> case<00:04:46.850> because<00:04:47.850> it's

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
the earth why in this case because it's

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.010 
the earth why in this case because it's
human<00:04:48.330> caused

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
human caused

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.140 
human caused
is<00:04:49.290> it<00:04:49.560> more<00:04:49.889> alarming<00:04:50.490> than<00:04:50.520> in<00:04:50.850> the<00:04:50.940> others

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
is it more alarming than in the others

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.700 
is it more alarming than in the others
or<00:04:51.330> is<00:04:51.480> it<00:04:51.630> more<00:04:51.810> alert<00:04:51.990> well<00:04:52.290> certainly<00:04:52.530> for

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
or is it more alert well certainly for

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.379 
or is it more alert well certainly for
an<00:04:52.770> ethicist<00:04:53.070> it's<00:04:53.460> it's<00:04:53.730> more<00:04:54.060> alarming

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:54.389 
an ethicist it's it's more alarming

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:57.740 
an ethicist it's it's more alarming
because<00:04:55.400> if<00:04:56.400> you<00:04:56.639> don't<00:04:56.790> have<00:04:57.060> control<00:04:57.389> over

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
because if you don't have control over

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.120 
because if you don't have control over
something<00:04:57.960> it's<00:04:58.650> not<00:04:58.830> your<00:04:59.040> responsibility

you have no moral obligation in this

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.900 
you have no moral obligation in this
case<00:05:02.580> we're<00:05:03.330> doing<00:05:03.690> it<00:05:03.840> so<00:05:04.430> we<00:05:05.430> at<00:05:05.550> least<00:05:05.700> have

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
case we're doing it so we at least have

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
what are the implications for human

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
beings when we're doing this well we

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.129 
beings when we're doing this well we
know<00:05:23.340> that<00:05:23.610> all<00:05:23.820> life<00:05:24.120> is<00:05:24.150> interdependent<00:05:25.080> and

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
long struggle for existence just as we

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.110 
long struggle for existence just as we
have<00:05:48.900> what<00:05:49.380> right<00:05:49.560> have<00:05:49.770> we<00:05:49.800> if<00:05:50.250> we<00:05:50.669> don't<00:05:50.880> have

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
have what right have we if we don't have

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.090 
have what right have we if we don't have
to<00:05:51.390> to<00:05:51.780> drive<00:05:51.990> them<00:05:52.229> off<00:05:52.320> the<00:05:52.530> planet<00:05:52.890> all

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.100 
to to drive them off the planet all

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.130 
to to drive them off the planet all
together<00:05:53.400> and<00:05:53.820> that<00:05:54.150> one<00:05:54.360> as<00:05:54.630> you<00:05:54.780> say<00:05:54.960> that's

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:55.140 
together and that one as you say that's

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.900 
together and that one as you say that's
where<00:05:55.380> I<00:05:55.410> guess<00:05:55.590> the<00:05:55.800> love<00:05:56.700> for<00:05:56.850> the

where I guess the love for the

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.969 
where I guess the love for the
