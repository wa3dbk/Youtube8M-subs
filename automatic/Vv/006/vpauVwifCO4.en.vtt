00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:11.120
 great desire for all the boys are 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.009
 mister white and welcome back here on anna 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.349
 welcome to this video 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:18.020
 today I want to talk to you about priorities 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:21.800
 of the most important things to do when 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:24.890
 you have a nice nest egg of eli 0 on 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.449
 clash of clans obviously because I want to 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.359
 tell you about this thing because often 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:32.200
 it happens especially arrived arrived at 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:34.460
 high levels of not knowing where 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.830
 let's say make the most of it 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.470
 the elixir that is accumulated with 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:42.200
 farming or with the attacks because I say 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.360
 this is because it obviously depends a lot 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.850
 from our abilities and from us 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.380
 we are used to attacking often though 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.360
 and gladly there are things that 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.440
 we must keep in mind why 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.660
 however, it is a real advantage 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.210
 compared to other things then without 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:03.950
 doubt the first thing to do when you are 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.870
 he has a nice little bundle of elixirs and that's it 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:19.880
 that I'm going to do since today since I 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:23.630
 we say accumulated 7686331 and a half for 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.670
 archers so the first thing that 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.520
 must do without a doubt is that which 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.820
 I will go and do today 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.640
 archers because the occupying troops 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.310
 first thing to do because the troops are 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.830
 the basis of all our attacks e 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.920
 above all they also give us the say 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.050
 way to support the clan in activities 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.650
 and to be supportive and helpful 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:51.920
 often participating on enough clans 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.440
 advanced level is required 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.420
 minimum of troops is therefore essential 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.700
 the troops immediately appear to avoid 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.440
 remain excluded I give an example in the 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.240
 clan where i am now guagni 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.020
 I remind you of the second club 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.479
 official for one the first 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.489
 it is enough in our case for example 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.660
 how well you see the archers who come 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:15.420
 required are strings if the tamers 45 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.489
 in short, if you have more level troops 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.110
 lower you are not automatically 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.150
 excluded from donations and therefore 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.610
 from the actual activity of the clan 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:28.319
 the second thing I would do immediately 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.000
 having a nice hoard of elixirs are 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.090
 the camps because the camps 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.890
 because as you well know the number of 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.950
 troops we can deploy is 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.380
 fundamental and certainly can affect 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.269
 positively higher than the 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.239
 number on the success of a 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:49.310
 attack one is in war and not in war 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:52.860
 the third important thing and not 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.690
 quite valued in the sense that often 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.200
 and gladly including them we leave them one 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.480
 bit back 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.730
 are at the development of the items of that 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.340
 potions we say because they are like that 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.510
 important positions because going 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.129
 we are ahead 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.470
 I am thinking, for example, of higher levels 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:10.109
 to face the villages they are 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.359
 really well thought out also because the 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:14.730
 player becomes more and more adept at 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:17.310
 structure in a coherent way 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.639
 the thing defended in these cases 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.590
 most important to do is without a doubt 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:25.019
 develop potions as they can 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.600
 be care in the case e.g. 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:30.650
 tamers fury in the case of dragons but 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.739
 also many others such as 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.909
 the spell that freezes we all say 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.470
 the enemy troops in case 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:38.930
 we have for example to stick in a 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:42.379
 point where there are hell towers and arches 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.659
 very dense hicks or jump if 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:46.939
 we want to pass over the 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:49.340
 walls to very large troops as an example 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:51.049
 the golems the giants 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:56.530
 so let's say these are the three 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:59.299
 priority to make regarding a 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.500
 booty consisting of elixir 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:03.040
 but this is not all because me 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.870
 obviously I tell you these suggestions 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.810
 because why they are in town hall and level 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:12.560
 10 by the way, sorry if the village is 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.420
 a bit low for this type of municipality 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.120
 but I did it for juan and to be able to 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.620
 let's say in a sense, making videos in 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.449
 case of occurring in the event that 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:25.490
 are needed and therefore this is the first 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:28.550
 are my personal considerations but 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.050
 obviously it must immediately be considered that the 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.509
 most important things to do at the stage 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:36.139
 previous are definitely occupy at 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:37.729
 maximum and spell laboratories e 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:39.169
 the wine changer factory in 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:43.250
 troop laboratory 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:45.740
 then summarizing the priority of the 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:49.460
 most important things to do with a 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.690
 booty consisting of the veer are do 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.260
 the troops especially those who 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:56.419
 we use the shooter more frequently 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.620
 immediately camps so 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:59.449
 such as to bring them to a level 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.090
 quite high so have a 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:02.960
 substantial 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.700
 amount of troops to be able 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.960
 exploit attacks in war 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:11.000
 normal and finally increase the level 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.100
 of our instincts of ours 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.180
 spells to support the 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:18.650
 better our troops 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.240
 that's all for this short video 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.950
 I just wanted to live together 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.110
 share your opinions with you 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.630
 also because I was sincerely very much 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:29.680
 indecisive I must be honest frau pare 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:32.810
 the camp to the maximum level 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.460
 archers at level 7 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.620
 I hope I did the right thing 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.610
 maybe tell me what you think about it 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.000
 comments 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:44.000
 tell me what you are others 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.660
 important upgrades to do some so much 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.800
 elixir 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:50.060
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:53.680
 let this be a nice like tantawi 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.680
 for everyone at the next video
