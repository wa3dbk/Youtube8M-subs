this<00:00:11.670> is<00:00:11.849> a<00:00:11.880> tutorial<00:00:12.150> and<00:00:12.780> a<00:00:12.840> review<00:00:14.420> so<00:00:15.420> the

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
this is a tutorial and a review so the

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.960 
this is a tutorial and a review so the
last<00:00:15.780> thing<00:00:15.900> we<00:00:16.080> go<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:16.260> hear<00:00:16.710> is<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:16.970> display

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
last thing we go to hear is the display

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.730 
last thing we go to hear is the display
you<00:00:18.029> have<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.510> ability<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:19.050> choose<00:00:19.410> what<00:00:19.710> you

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
you have the ability to choose what you

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.220 
you have the ability to choose what you
want<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.160> display<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.730> say<00:00:21.090> i'm<00:00:21.840> not<00:00:21.900> using

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
want the display to say i'm not using

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.900 
want the display to say i'm not using
these<00:00:22.470> illumination<00:00:23.160> channels<00:00:23.519> here<00:00:23.670> so<00:00:23.880> i

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
these illumination channels here so i

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.700 
these illumination channels here so i
certainly<00:00:24.300> don't<00:00:24.420> want<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.689> see<00:00:24.960> them<00:00:25.109> because

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
certainly don't want to see them because

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.019 
certainly don't want to see them because
they'll<00:00:25.859> just<00:00:26.070> show<00:00:26.220> up<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.460> say<00:00:26.640> zero

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
they'll just show up and say zero

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.630 
they'll just show up and say zero
percent<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:28.140> i<00:00:28.170> select<00:00:28.470> illumination<00:00:29.250> one<00:00:29.460> and

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
percent so i select illumination one and

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.400 
percent so i select illumination one and
two<00:00:29.820> i<00:00:30.090> also<00:00:30.359> want<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.720> see<00:00:30.840> what<00:00:30.990> my<00:00:31.080> pump

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
two i also want to see what my pump

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.530 
two i also want to see what my pump
action<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:31.890> doing<00:00:32.219> it'll<00:00:32.940> tell<00:00:33.120> me<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.329> moon

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
action is doing it'll tell me the moon

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.530 
action is doing it'll tell me the moon
phase<00:00:33.840> percentage<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:35.370> also<00:00:35.579> flash<00:00:36.000> your<00:00:36.239> ph

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
phase percentage it also flash your ph

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.130 
phase percentage it also flash your ph
value<00:00:36.989> temperature<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.190> level<00:00:38.489> control

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
value temperature and the level control

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.319 
value temperature and the level control
time<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.350> date<00:00:40.559> i<00:00:40.800> always<00:00:41.309> show<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.790> it'll

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
time and date i always show that it'll

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.030 
time and date i always show that it'll
be<00:00:42.420> on<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.600> top<00:00:42.930> screen<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.649> then<00:00:43.890> the

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
be on the top screen and then the

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.010 
be on the top screen and then the
display<00:00:44.489> time<00:00:44.789> i<00:00:45.090> have<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.510> set<00:00:45.539> at<00:00:45.750> five

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
display time i have it set at five

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.930 
display time i have it set at five
seconds<00:00:46.500> so<00:00:46.590> every<00:00:46.800> five<00:00:46.980> seconds<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.520> rotates

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
seconds so every five seconds it rotates

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.510 
seconds so every five seconds it rotates
to<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.210> next<00:00:48.629> level<00:00:49.110> i'm<00:00:49.680> not<00:00:49.890> sure<00:00:49.950> how<00:00:50.280> well

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
to the next level i'm not sure how well

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.170 
to the next level i'm not sure how well
you<00:00:50.730> guys<00:00:50.850> can<00:00:50.910> see<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.539> but<00:00:51.719> i'll<00:00:51.870> show<00:00:52.110> you

what's happening here mmm I don't think
that's<00:00:56.520> going<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.820> come<00:00:57.030> out<00:00:59.780> you<00:01:00.780> might<00:01:00.989> be

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
that's going to come out you might be

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.270 
that's going to come out you might be
able<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.289> see<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.469> there<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:01.859> now<00:01:02.039> we're<00:01:02.190> on

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
able to see it there so now we're on

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.969 
able to see it there so now we're on
temperature<00:01:02.730> 80°<00:01:03.000> 1.4<00:01:03.750> degrees<00:01:03.870> shows<00:01:04.799> the

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
temperature 80° 1.4 degrees shows the

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.670 
temperature 80° 1.4 degrees shows the
current<00:01:05.159> time<00:01:05.489> at<00:01:05.700> 119<00:01:06.420> p.m.<00:01:06.780> there's<00:01:07.409> the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
current time at 119 p.m. there's the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.760 
current time at 119 p.m. there's the
level<00:01:07.979> control<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:09.150> X<00:01:09.420> signifies<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.439> the

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
level control the X signifies that the

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.410 
level control the X signifies that the
float<00:01:11.250> is<00:01:11.460> up<00:01:12.470> when<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.890> flow<00:01:14.189> goes<00:01:14.430> down<00:01:14.909> it

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
float is up when the flow goes down it

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.320 
float is up when the flow goes down it
goes<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.920> X<00:01:17.070> goes<00:01:17.310> away<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:18.150> there's

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
goes the X goes away so there's

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.580 
goes the X goes away so there's
illumination<00:01:18.930> number<00:01:19.170> two<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:19.470> that

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
illumination number two is that

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.960 
illumination number two is that
eighty-seven<00:01:20.100> percent<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.460> can<00:01:20.580> see<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.729> cloud

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
eighty-seven percent you can see a cloud

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.670 
eighty-seven percent you can see a cloud
is<00:01:21.180> going<00:01:21.450> away<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.930> it's<00:01:22.110> maxing<00:01:22.590> out

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
is going away and it's maxing out

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.080 
is going away and it's maxing out
there's<00:01:23.430> your<00:01:23.610> pump<00:01:23.880> oscillating<00:01:26.090> there's

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
there's your pump oscillating there's

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.760 
there's your pump oscillating there's
your<00:01:27.240> moon<00:01:27.390> phase<00:01:27.630> sixty-two<00:01:28.259> percent<00:01:30.770> and

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
your moon phase sixty-two percent and

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.289 
your moon phase sixty-two percent and
then<00:01:32.040> we<00:01:32.130> go<00:01:32.280> back<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.759> beginning<00:01:32.880> which

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
then we go back to the beginning which

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.660 
then we go back to the beginning which
is<00:01:33.450> PHA<00:01:34.310> 8.06<00:01:36.229> alright<00:01:37.229> well<00:01:38.220> what<00:01:38.430> if<00:01:38.549> you're

filter that's the skimmer three four and
five<00:02:43.920> or<00:02:44.160> blank<00:02:44.550> so<00:02:45.150> it<00:02:45.360> doesn't<00:02:45.510> really

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
five or blank so it doesn't really

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.990 
five or blank so it doesn't really
matter<00:02:45.900> what<00:02:46.200> they<00:02:46.350> say<00:02:46.820> six<00:02:47.820> is<00:02:47.970> the

matter what they say six is the

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.699 
matter what they say six is the
temperature<00:02:48.480> and<00:02:48.780> as<00:02:48.900> you<00:02:49.020> can<00:02:49.170> see<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.530> red

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.650 
temperature and as you can see the red
light<00:02:49.739> means<00:02:50.130> it's<00:02:50.430> on<00:02:50.610> so<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.120> skimmer<00:02:51.360> is<00:02:51.480> on

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
light means it's on so the skimmer is on
