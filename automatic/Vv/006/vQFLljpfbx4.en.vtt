hey what's up everyone this is Alder
Anastasio<00:00:10.790> with<00:00:11.060> flight<00:00:11.450> path<00:00:11.720> calm<00:00:12.350> and

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:12.740 
Anastasio with flight path calm and

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.830 
Anastasio with flight path calm and
today<00:00:13.520> just<00:00:13.700> want<00:00:13.820> to<00:00:13.910> do<00:00:14.030> a<00:00:14.059> quick<00:00:14.420> review<00:00:14.600> on

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:14.840 
today just want to do a quick review on

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.609 
today just want to do a quick review on
the<00:00:15.290> Snake<00:00:15.830> River<00:00:16.240> prototyping<00:00:17.320> nd<00:00:18.320> filters

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:18.619 
the Snake River prototyping nd filters

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.450 
the Snake River prototyping nd filters
used<00:00:19.580> on<00:00:19.820> the<00:00:19.990> GoPro<00:00:20.990> Hero<00:00:21.470> 3<00:00:21.560> and<00:00:22.040> the<00:00:22.130> GoPro

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
used on the GoPro Hero 3 and the GoPro

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.790 
used on the GoPro Hero 3 and the GoPro
Hero<00:00:22.760> 4<00:00:23.050> so<00:00:24.050> the<00:00:24.140> first<00:00:24.260> one<00:00:24.410> we're<00:00:24.619> going<00:00:24.710> to

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
Hero 4 so the first one we're going to

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.779 
Hero 4 so the first one we're going to
show<00:00:25.160> you<00:00:25.220> is<00:00:25.640> the<00:00:25.910> ND<00:00:26.869> for<00:00:27.830> neutral<00:00:28.699> density

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 
show you is the ND for neutral density

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.189 
show you is the ND for neutral density
filter<00:00:29.420> number<00:00:29.869> four<00:00:30.490> from<00:00:31.490> SRP<00:00:32.150> and<00:00:32.419> these

00:00:33.189 --> 00:00:33.199 
filter number four from SRP and these

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:35.680 
filter number four from SRP and these
filters<00:00:33.470> are<00:00:34.010> glass<00:00:34.460> and<00:00:34.850> they<00:00:34.940> all<00:00:35.059> come<00:00:35.360> in

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
filters are glass and they all come in

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.020 
filters are glass and they all come in
three<00:00:36.020> pieces<00:00:36.290> so<00:00:36.920> this<00:00:37.160> is<00:00:37.309> the<00:00:37.430> inner<00:00:37.699> ring

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
three pieces so this is the inner ring

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.880 
three pieces so this is the inner ring
that<00:00:38.360> actually<00:00:38.750> goes<00:00:38.900> around<00:00:39.199> the<00:00:39.440> lens<00:00:39.739> of

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
that actually goes around the lens of

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.979 
that actually goes around the lens of
the<00:00:40.010> GoPro<00:00:40.420> and<00:00:41.420> then<00:00:41.540> we<00:00:41.630> have<00:00:41.750> the<00:00:41.840> outer

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
the GoPro and then we have the outer

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:44.979 
the GoPro and then we have the outer
ring<00:00:42.290> that<00:00:42.620> holds<00:00:43.070> the<00:00:43.579> glass<00:00:43.940> itself<00:00:44.210> so<00:00:44.840> this

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
ring that holds the glass itself so this

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.970 
ring that holds the glass itself so this
is<00:00:45.020> the<00:00:45.170> ND<00:00:45.530> for<00:00:45.829> glass<00:00:47.050> so<00:00:48.050> we<00:00:48.500> are<00:00:48.649> able<00:00:48.680> to

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
is the ND for glass so we are able to

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.160 
is the ND for glass so we are able to
take<00:00:49.219> out<00:00:49.370> the<00:00:49.520> glass<00:00:49.730> clean<00:00:50.360> it<00:00:50.510> put<00:00:50.989> it<00:00:51.079> back

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
take out the glass clean it put it back

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.720 
take out the glass clean it put it back
in<00:00:51.350> and<00:00:51.710> as<00:00:51.890> she<00:00:52.010> does<00:00:52.160> will<00:00:52.340> come<00:00:52.520> with<00:00:52.700> a

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
in and as she does will come with a

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.440 
in and as she does will come with a
little<00:00:53.000> one<00:00:53.239> lens<00:00:53.809> wipe<00:00:54.320> and<00:00:55.000> then<00:00:56.000> you<00:00:56.300> use

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
little one lens wipe and then you use

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.540 
little one lens wipe and then you use
inner<00:00:56.660> ring<00:00:56.930> and<00:00:57.170> tighten<00:00:57.620> it<00:00:57.710> together<00:00:58.280> to

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
inner ring and tighten it together to

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.720 
inner ring and tighten it together to
compress<00:00:59.539> the<00:00:59.660> class<00:00:59.870> in<00:01:00.079> there<00:01:00.230> so<00:01:00.550> it's<00:01:01.550> nice

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
compress the class in there so it's nice

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.210 
compress the class in there so it's nice
and<00:01:01.760> steady<00:01:02.180> and<00:01:02.600> then<00:01:03.110> you<00:01:03.230> go<00:01:03.350> ahead<00:01:03.469> and<00:01:03.590> put

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
and steady and then you go ahead and put

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.370 
and steady and then you go ahead and put
the<00:01:04.460> lens<00:01:04.879> cover<00:01:05.330> right<00:01:05.600> over<00:01:05.780> the<00:01:05.869> GoPro<00:01:06.200> and

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
the lens cover right over the GoPro and

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.160 
the lens cover right over the GoPro and
I<00:01:06.950> normally<00:01:07.280> do<00:01:07.399> this<00:01:07.580> when<00:01:07.970> the<00:01:08.149> copter<00:01:08.990> is

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
I normally do this when the copter is

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.210 
I normally do this when the copter is
off<00:01:10.450> that<00:01:11.450> way<00:01:11.750> the<00:01:12.080> the<00:01:12.110> gimbal<00:01:12.740> itself<00:01:13.100> is

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
off that way the the gimbal itself is

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.190 
off that way the the gimbal itself is
not<00:01:13.369> really<00:01:13.970> putting<00:01:14.479> any<00:01:14.690> strain<00:01:14.990> on<00:01:15.110> the

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
not really putting any strain on the

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.650 
not really putting any strain on the
gimbal<00:01:15.530> so<00:01:16.310> once<00:01:16.490> it's<00:01:16.640> on<00:01:16.759> i'll<00:01:17.179> go<00:01:17.390> ahead<00:01:17.420> and

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
gimbal so once it's on i'll go ahead and

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.100 
gimbal so once it's on i'll go ahead and
position<00:01:18.170> it<00:01:18.709> and<00:01:18.979> then<00:01:19.910> i<00:01:19.940> will<00:01:20.179> turn<00:01:20.539> on<00:01:20.780> the

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
position it and then i will turn on the

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.639 
position it and then i will turn on the
the<00:01:21.530> copter<00:01:22.119> that<00:01:23.119> way<00:01:23.360> the<00:01:23.569> gimbal<00:01:23.929> will<00:01:24.140> that

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 
the copter that way the gimbal will that

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:27.010 
the copter that way the gimbal will that
rebalance<00:01:25.250> the<00:01:25.520> gopro<00:01:25.910> with<00:01:26.300> the<00:01:26.509> filter<00:01:26.869> on

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
rebalance the gopro with the filter on

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.410 
rebalance the gopro with the filter on
it<00:01:27.050> i<00:01:27.380> know<00:01:28.250> some<00:01:28.459> people<00:01:28.490> had<00:01:28.789> some<00:01:28.970> balancing

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
it i know some people had some balancing

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.870 
it i know some people had some balancing
issues<00:01:29.569> and<00:01:30.140> had<00:01:30.289> to<00:01:30.500> you<00:01:31.069> know<00:01:31.160> add<00:01:31.640> some

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
issues and had to you know add some

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.059 
issues and had to you know add some
weights<00:01:32.149> to<00:01:33.020> the<00:01:33.140> side<00:01:33.410> of<00:01:33.440> the<00:01:33.560> gimbal<00:01:33.860> or<00:01:33.979> the

00:01:34.059 --> 00:01:34.069 
weights to the side of the gimbal or the

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:36.040 
weights to the side of the gimbal or the
back<00:01:34.220> of<00:01:34.369> the<00:01:34.429> gopro<00:01:34.759> i<00:01:35.030> haven't<00:01:35.479> had<00:01:35.599> to<00:01:35.660> do

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
back of the gopro i haven't had to do

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.359 
back of the gopro i haven't had to do
that<00:01:36.080> just<00:01:36.470> yet<00:01:36.880> but<00:01:38.679> we'll<00:01:39.679> see<00:01:39.890> you<00:01:40.160> know<00:01:40.280> in

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
that just yet but we'll see you know in

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.180 
that just yet but we'll see you know in
the<00:01:40.459> long<00:01:40.580> run<00:01:40.640> if<00:01:40.940> the<00:01:41.690> gimbal<00:01:42.200> begins<00:01:42.920> to

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
the long run if the gimbal begins to

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:44.980 
the long run if the gimbal begins to
heat<00:01:43.429> or<00:01:43.459> stress<00:01:44.119> a<00:01:44.149> little<00:01:44.330> bit<00:01:44.539> but<00:01:44.660> as<00:01:44.929> of

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
heat or stress a little bit but as of

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.570 
heat or stress a little bit but as of
right<00:01:45.050> now<00:01:45.140> i<00:01:45.470> haven't<00:01:45.770> had<00:01:45.950> to<00:01:46.009> put<00:01:46.369> any

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
right now i haven't had to put any

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.850 
right now i haven't had to put any
counter<00:01:46.970> weights<00:01:47.149> so<00:01:48.140> you<00:01:48.229> can<00:01:48.349> see<00:01:48.440> here<00:01:48.619> the

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
counter weights so you can see here the

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.240 
counter weights so you can see here the
motion<00:01:49.310> up<00:01:49.459> and<00:01:49.550> down<00:01:49.729> still<00:01:50.360> works<00:01:50.660> fun

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
motion up and down still works fun

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.430 
motion up and down still works fun
controlling<00:01:52.250> it<00:01:52.340> with<00:01:52.489> the<00:01:52.759> remote<00:01:53.060> and<00:01:53.440> as

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
controlling it with the remote and as

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.729 
controlling it with the remote and as
well<00:01:54.679> as<00:01:54.709> the<00:01:55.869> left<00:01:56.869> to<00:01:56.989> right<00:01:57.110> the<00:01:57.410> yaw

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:57.739 
well as the left to right the yaw

00:01:57.739 --> 00:02:08.600 
well as the left to right the yaw
movement<00:01:58.130> for<00:01:58.340> the<00:01:58.700> gimbal<00:01:59.090> works<00:01:59.330> fine

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.230 

so<00:02:09.090> here<00:02:09.240> we<00:02:09.360> have<00:02:09.390> some<00:02:09.720> raw<00:02:10.020> footage<00:02:10.910> no<00:02:11.910> post

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
so here we have some raw footage no post

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.120 
so here we have some raw footage no post
has<00:02:12.420> been<00:02:12.600> done<00:02:12.720> 10<00:02:12.870> in<00:02:13.050> this<00:02:13.110> footage<00:02:13.470> and<00:02:13.680> as

as<00:02:26.490> it<00:02:26.640> spins<00:02:26.970> right<00:02:27.390> over<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:27.930> GoPro<00:02:28.440> lens

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
as it spins right over the GoPro lens

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:29.870 
as it spins right over the GoPro lens
and<00:02:29.040> that's<00:02:29.160> what<00:02:29.310> you're<00:02:29.400> able<00:02:29.490> to<00:02:29.610> see<00:02:29.730> those

and that's what you're able to see those

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.590 
and that's what you're able to see those
lines<00:02:30.350> so<00:02:31.350> adding<00:02:31.680> an<00:02:31.770> ND<00:02:31.980> for<00:02:32.250> filter<00:02:32.730> what<00:02:33.510> it

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
lines so adding an ND for filter what it

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.570 
lines so adding an ND for filter what it
does<00:02:33.720> it<00:02:33.840> slows<00:02:34.140> down<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.770> automatic<00:02:35.280> shutter

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
does it slows down the automatic shutter

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.030 
does it slows down the automatic shutter
by<00:02:36.570> reducing<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:37.020> amount<00:02:37.260> of<00:02:37.410> light<00:02:37.500> on<00:02:37.920> the

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
by reducing the amount of light on the

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.520 
by reducing the amount of light on the
camera<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.820> as<00:02:39.270> you<00:02:39.390> see<00:02:39.600> on<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:39.780> left<00:02:40.080> is<00:02:40.260> no

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
camera and as you see on the left is no

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:48.370 
camera and as you see on the left is no
filter<00:02:40.950> on<00:02:41.100> the<00:02:41.160> right<00:02:41.430> is<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.790> ND<00:02:42.209> for<00:02:42.540> filter

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.260 

let's<00:02:49.380> go<00:02:49.500> ahead<00:02:49.650> and<00:02:49.770> try<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.100> nd8<00:02:50.730> so

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
let's go ahead and try the nd8 so

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.850 
let's go ahead and try the nd8 so
depending<00:02:51.690> on<00:02:51.780> how<00:02:51.900> bright<00:02:52.170> your<00:02:52.320> day<00:02:52.440> is<00:02:52.650> in

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
depending on how bright your day is in

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.949 
depending on how bright your day is in
which<00:02:53.130> direction<00:02:53.310> you're<00:02:53.670> shooting<00:02:54.000> into<00:02:54.120> you

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
which direction you're shooting into you

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.890 
which direction you're shooting into you
can<00:02:55.140> try<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:56.160> ND<00:02:56.459> for<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.910> nd8<00:02:57.180> so<00:02:57.570> this<00:02:57.720> is<00:02:57.840> an

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
can try the ND for the nd8 so this is an

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.310 
can try the ND for the nd8 so this is an
example<00:02:57.930> of<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.709> NDA<00:02:59.130> filter<00:02:59.850> and<00:03:00.270> we'll<00:03:01.140> put

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
example of the NDA filter and we'll put

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.199 
example of the NDA filter and we'll put
these<00:03:01.440> side<00:03:01.680> by<00:03:01.709> side<00:03:02.130> so<00:03:02.430> I'm<00:03:02.550> not<00:03:02.670> very<00:03:02.910> left

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209
