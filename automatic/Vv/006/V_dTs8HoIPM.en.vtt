00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
that when I first started playing and

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.000 
that when I first started playing and
then<00:02:56.150> world<00:02:56.360> of<00:02:56.450> warcraft<00:02:56.870> inevitably<00:02:57.590> took

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
then world of warcraft inevitably took

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.760 
then world of warcraft inevitably took
over<00:02:58.370> again<00:02:58.670> but<00:02:59.000> that<00:02:59.660> pretty<00:03:00.020> much<00:03:00.200> sums<00:03:00.530> up

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
over again but that pretty much sums up

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.790 
over again but that pretty much sums up
