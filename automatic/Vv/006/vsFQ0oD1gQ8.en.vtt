a lantern I do not think that this is a
light<00:02:29.230> up<00:02:29.380> I<00:02:29.500> think<00:02:29.710> it's<00:02:29.830> the<00:02:29.950> light-up<00:02:30.160> one

light up I think it's the light-up one
but<00:02:30.670> without<00:02:30.880> the<00:02:31.030> light-up<00:02:31.240> feature<00:02:31.390> which

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
but without the light-up feature which

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.510 
but without the light-up feature which
is<00:02:32.140> kind<00:02:32.350> of<00:02:32.440> nice<00:02:32.560> because<00:02:32.620> I<00:02:33.100> feel<00:02:33.310> like<00:02:33.340> that

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
is kind of nice because I feel like that

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.120 
is kind of nice because I feel like that
light-up<00:02:34.420> feature<00:02:34.570> is<00:02:35.140> useless<00:02:35.650> he<00:02:35.830> comes

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
light-up feature is useless he comes

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.190

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
black Payne's grey I think that's the

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.270 
black Payne's grey I think that's the
term<00:02:43.120> they<00:02:43.300> use<00:02:43.330> nice<00:02:44.080> colored<00:02:44.560> tattoos<00:02:45.100> and

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
term they use nice colored tattoos and

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.010 
term they use nice colored tattoos and
unfortunately<00:02:45.880> I'm<00:02:46.090> feeling<00:02:46.690> a<00:02:46.750> bit<00:02:46.780> of

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
unfortunately I'm feeling a bit of

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.950 
unfortunately I'm feeling a bit of
looseness<00:02:47.350> in<00:02:47.860> his<00:02:48.160> joints<00:02:48.580> which<00:02:48.970> depending

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
looseness in his joints which depending

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.780 
looseness in his joints which depending
on<00:02:50.050> you<00:02:50.230> you<00:02:50.350> might<00:02:50.530> like<00:02:50.770> that<00:02:50.800> but<00:02:51.160> for<00:02:51.400> me<00:02:51.580> I

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
on you you might like that but for me I

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.460 
on you you might like that but for me I

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.940 
do not I wish they were a little more
stiff<00:02:53.920> but<00:02:54.610> overall<00:02:55.540> I'd<00:02:55.750> say<00:02:55.810> that<00:02:56.290> this<00:02:56.650> is

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950
