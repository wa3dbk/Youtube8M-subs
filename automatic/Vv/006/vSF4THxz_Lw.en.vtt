00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.199
 aa valid beauty that anyone who speaks steak 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.640
 be it for another video in this video 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.320
 People I'm here with a half game. 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.820
 different but this is not the purpose of 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.080
 game on video opa is only in games and 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.009
 so in the background 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.180
 supposed to be fast even if 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.829
 do not be fast right? 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.360
 the channel warnings a warning that I think 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.190
 that you may have noticed 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.190
 they had realized everything was okay 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:57.780
 the reasoning was me 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:24.119
 You may be realizing but I'm 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:28.580
 77 new that is the tubik fish 22 21 x 12 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.580
 he ended up joining the family of 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:38.299
 microphone in beauty 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.299
 I recorded a test 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.840
 I also made a video of other times 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.090
 that ended up interrupting my fanaticism 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.479
 Check if the quality is good. 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.240
 Magnetic face but I loved this 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:56.360
 quality new audio one penny per account 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.640
 of the video is oleg of the business ne 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.140
 is the game that the game of the popular cattle 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.509
 should slightly reduce the quality of 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.509
 graphics this thing alright 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:08.569
 then this is good because it also gives 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.940
 listen to your live live voice that you 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.040
 ever saw a steak literally call 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.860
 The sound is heard only for you 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:20.620
 This spokesperson and I can say do not have 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.970
 voice delay are paulo is kind listening and 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.950
 Magnificent seven my parents brought to 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.769
 me from portugal we had another 77 in 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.680
 my list of choices but this is it 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:33.050
 well okay 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:41.450
 worse than I thought 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:44.410
 and I thought I have that here but 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.989
 is a very bad complaint is not that the 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.790
 he is very soft and he is 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.250
 very flexible and this ends up disrupting 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:56.239
 A little bit because you end up messing around without 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:58.280
 want the microphone and then when there is 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:03.440
 a change in your voice in another video to 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:09.080
 50 base but not too much trouble 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:13.520
 and it is not is this is the r7 also has another 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:17.200
 news is bad in the right channel is that 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:19.190
 Wednesday I'll be traveling 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.040
 because I'll be in the middle of a 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:26.480
 graduation graduation trip 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:33.230
 I'm in the year and then I'm going to 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:41.810
 first year and traveling will be 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:43.100
 Wednesday until Sunday is fair on 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.510
 The day I have to record video see 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.760
 Let's see if I can make a video. 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.980
 It runs through Sunday so when we return 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.960
 It will be difficult to get around the 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:56.390
 seven in the afternoon so a little complicated 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.820
 4780 need to post videos on youtube there 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.710
 a short video, right? 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.940
 a bg on youtube and then you stay 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:05.660
 informed 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.680
 so people are and I also wanted to do 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:15.500
 a question now that I saw in my 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:19.700
 head this kind of 122 stadium 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:23.060
 people wanted to play channel because it's the 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:30.740
 player has been in the 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:32.660
 multiplayer also run is not that the 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.330
 face can face like i want to hit 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:38.540
 Paqueta one guy can not fuck it 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.460
 nothing rolls when they want to brake on the 7th 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.669
 the old 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:46.370
 then I play here playing the silveira 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:48.800
 so I could reasonably 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.650
 connect content with playstation will 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.590
 function as xbox controller 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:56.870
 tibet beauty try the gold medal 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.780
 and there it is very good to play in place 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:02.270
 of the keyboard had had had 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.420
 7 my then it's simpler there to 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.690
 me much simpler too 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:10.270
 It is but this is a question last 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.440
 time, that's all I hope so 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.850
 have liked the video is favorite 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.920
 video result leave your opinion on 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.850
 97 that were found that you did not find 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.150
 etc. and such 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:23.890
 she strikes great there some I think the 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:26.140
 another perhaps but still may be 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.150
 maybe like this but I sure will 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:31.150
 stay with the team 100% sure 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:33.910
 it's a bit tricky to use the 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.440
 holy name that here has a very 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.870
 complicated to install on the 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:41.080
 Very complicated playstation 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:43.330
 so I 'll end up using anp comics 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:46.300
 the mix anp when I tried to join the two 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.790
 mix up in today's junk business today 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.320
 in the quality of the television nowadays has 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.480
 Mixing the two did not work. 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.850
 I want to stay in the background forever. 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:58.650
 I was in my place and I think it 's just the 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:06:01.450
 matter does not continue the same josa and there it is 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:04.660
 praise is a certain way puts the phone 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:05.830
 of normal ear that neither so below 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.890
 7 in the box 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:10.210
 however, and despite an extension of the 

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:12.660
 heard because his son is very 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.660
 small 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:19.210
 only that the problem then okay 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:22.020
 so longer and I went to the next 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.020
 video 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:34.900
 no one remembers that there and wanted 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:39.030
 even going to the field and the iscte anyway 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.030
 drunk during the time when the river
