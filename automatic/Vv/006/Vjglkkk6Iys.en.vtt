00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
at this point we have our instrument set

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.889 
at this point we have our instrument set
our<00:00:04.170> lights<00:00:04.500> set<00:00:04.920> it's<00:00:05.759> framed<00:00:06.180> in<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.480> camera

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
to do is within the camera I've gone to

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.410 
to do is within the camera I've gone to
the<00:00:24.480> menu<00:00:24.990> on<00:00:25.380> this<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.340> now<00:00:26.550> I'm<00:00:26.760> going<00:00:27.180> to

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
the menu on this and now I'm going to

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.790 
the menu on this and now I'm going to
move<00:00:27.630> down<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.260> WB<00:00:29.039> white<00:00:29.519> balance<00:00:30.090> and

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
move down to the WB white balance and

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.920 
move down to the WB white balance and
slide<00:00:31.800> over<00:00:31.830> in<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.730> menu<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.390> see<00:00:33.660> which

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
slide over in the menu to see which

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.750 
slide over in the menu to see which
kinds<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.410> light<00:00:34.620> balances<00:00:35.160> there<00:00:35.340> are<00:00:35.520> and

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
kinds of light balances there are and

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.389 
kinds of light balances there are and
luckily<00:00:36.540> on<00:00:36.750> this<00:00:36.960> camera<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.590> can<00:00:38.190> actually

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
luckily on this camera I can actually

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.310 
luckily on this camera I can actually
see<00:00:38.879> what<00:00:38.910> happens<00:00:39.450> as<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.719> shift<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.140> white

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
see what happens as I shift the white

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.740 
see what happens as I shift the white
balance<00:00:40.559> from<00:00:41.430> auto<00:00:42.110> to<00:00:43.110> daylight<00:00:44.300> to<00:00:45.300> cloudy

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
balance from auto to daylight to cloudy

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.740 
balance from auto to daylight to cloudy
sky<00:00:46.260> can<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:46.950> see<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.340> shift<00:00:47.579> when<00:00:48.329> we<00:00:48.420> put<00:00:48.629> on

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
sky can you see the shift when we put on

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.080 
sky can you see the shift when we put on
cloudy<00:00:49.079> sky<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.649> shifted<00:00:50.039> into<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.340> pink<00:00:50.700> for

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
cloudy sky it shifted into a pink for

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.779 
cloudy sky it shifted into a pink for
the<00:00:51.149> background<00:00:51.800> if<00:00:52.800> we<00:00:52.980> move<00:00:53.190> down<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.610> the

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
the background if we move down to the

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.850 
the background if we move down to the
next<00:00:53.820> one<00:00:54.239> tungsten<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.379> turned<00:00:55.710> the

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
next one tungsten it turned the

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.880 
next one tungsten it turned the
background<00:00:56.489> turns<00:00:56.760> blue<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.539> if<00:00:58.379> we<00:00:58.530> move<00:00:58.710> to

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
background turns blue and if we move to

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.340 
background turns blue and if we move to
the<00:00:59.010> florescent<00:00:59.609> it<00:00:59.760> has<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.329> slightly<00:01:00.930> pinkish

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
the florescent it has a slightly pinkish

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.450 
the florescent it has a slightly pinkish
orange<00:01:01.680> cast<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:03.149> closest<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.840> pure<00:01:04.080> white

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
orange cast the closest to pure white

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.420 
orange cast the closest to pure white
appears<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.729> be<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.450> auto<00:01:06.689> function<00:01:07.320> which<00:01:08.250> is

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
appears to be the auto function which is

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.420 
appears to be the auto function which is
a<00:01:08.460> little<00:01:08.970> bit<00:01:09.150> bluer<00:01:09.689> than<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.979> daylight

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
a little bit bluer than the daylight

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.260 
a little bit bluer than the daylight
function<00:01:11.970> probably<00:01:12.930> as<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.110> result<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:14.270> that

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
function probably as a result of that

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.090 
function probably as a result of that
fluorescent<00:01:15.780> light<00:01:16.110> right<00:01:16.350> there<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:16.920> we'll

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
fluorescent light right there so we'll

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.100 
fluorescent light right there so we'll
leave<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.340> on<00:01:17.670> auto<00:01:18.030> we'll<00:01:18.390> set<00:01:18.689> it<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.930> auto

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
leave it on auto we'll set it to auto

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.190 
leave it on auto we'll set it to auto
and<00:01:19.500> then<00:01:20.130> let's<00:01:20.340> move<00:01:20.520> down<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.820> ISO<00:01:21.570> now<00:01:21.840> why

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
and then let's move down to ISO now why

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.030 
and then let's move down to ISO now why
would<00:01:22.830> we<00:01:23.009> want<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.369> adjust<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:24.090> ISO<00:01:24.299> on<00:01:25.040> a

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
would we want to adjust the ISO on a

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.890 
would we want to adjust the ISO on a
digital<00:01:26.369> camera<00:01:26.820> doesn't<00:01:27.390> really<00:01:27.509> make<00:01:27.689> any

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
digital camera doesn't really make any

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.330 
digital camera doesn't really make any
difference<00:01:27.960> in<00:01:28.380> filming<00:01:28.710> makes<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:29.009> big<00:01:29.189> deal

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
difference in filming makes a big deal

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.770 
difference in filming makes a big deal
difference<00:01:29.880> because<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.270> have<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.570> put<00:01:30.750> a

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
difference because you have to put a

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.469 
difference because you have to put a
four<00:01:31.110> hundred<00:01:31.320> speed<00:01:32.100> film<00:01:32.130> in<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.909> camera<00:01:32.939> and

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
four hundred speed film in a camera and

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.310 
four hundred speed film in a camera and
set<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.810> ISO<00:01:33.990> if<00:01:34.829> you're<00:01:35.310> running<00:01:35.490> under<00:01:35.939> a

shooting say Kodachrome and the ISO
makes<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.990> big<00:01:49.229> deal<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.590> difference<00:01:49.799> in<00:01:50.369> that

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
makes a big deal of difference in that

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.230 
makes a big deal of difference in that
digital<00:01:51.240> or<00:01:51.600> in<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:51.960> film<00:01:52.770> realm<00:01:53.040> whereas<00:01:54.030> in

the digital realm

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.179 
the digital realm
it's<00:01:55.850> what's<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.030> point<00:01:57.270> okay<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.920> film

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
it's what's the point okay the film

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.160 
it's what's the point okay the film
there<00:01:59.759> is<00:01:59.790> no<00:01:59.909> film<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:00.659> don't<00:02:00.899> have<00:02:01.020> to

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
there is no film so you don't have to

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.200 
there is no film so you don't have to
