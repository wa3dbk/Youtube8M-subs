00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
final which I thought I'd be obliged to

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.139 
final which I thought I'd be obliged to
hopefully<00:00:35.700> get<00:00:37.520> Newcastle<00:00:38.520> their<00:00:38.790> first

in<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.729> speculation<00:01:09.240> on<00:01:09.299> rumors<00:01:09.659> we<00:01:09.840> can

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
in to speculation on rumors we can

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.410 
in to speculation on rumors we can
suggest<00:01:10.229> we<00:01:10.680> can<00:01:10.799> statistically<00:01:11.070> win<00:01:11.790> but

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
suggest we can statistically win but

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.060 
suggest we can statistically win but
requires<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:13.170> don't<00:01:13.350> think<00:01:13.500> it's<00:01:13.619> possible<00:01:13.799> I

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
requires I don't think it's possible I

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.490 
requires I don't think it's possible I
think<00:01:14.360> we're<00:01:15.360> going<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.540> make<00:01:15.600> top<00:01:15.869> four<00:01:16.080> top

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500

but we do have a home match against

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.080 
but we do have a home match against
Manchester<00:03:33.820> United<00:03:33.850> if<00:03:34.240> we<00:03:34.300> can<00:03:34.450> bring<00:03:34.630> a<00:03:34.870> draw

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
heavily heavily week and I could have

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.720 
heavily heavily week and I could have
done<00:03:43.300> a<00:03:43.710> bit<00:03:44.710> of<00:03:44.740> rotation<00:03:44.950> but<00:03:45.400> I<00:03:45.490> really

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
done a bit of rotation but I really

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.090 
done a bit of rotation but I really
wanted<00:03:45.940> to<00:03:46.060> field<00:03:46.390> my<00:03:46.870> first<00:03:47.170> starting<00:03:47.770> eleven

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
wanted to field my first starting eleven

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.860 
wanted to field my first starting eleven
against<00:03:48.580> United<00:03:49.150> and<00:03:49.270> then<00:03:49.420> maybe<00:03:49.630> at

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
against United and then maybe at

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.600 
against United and then maybe at
halftime<00:03:50.080> or<00:03:50.770> the<00:03:50.980> seventh<00:03:51.250> thing<00:03:51.370> they<00:03:51.460> might

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
halftime or the seventh thing they might

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.090 
halftime or the seventh thing they might
bring<00:03:51.790> on<00:03:52.000> the<00:03:52.120> triple<00:03:52.450> threat<00:03:52.750> but<00:03:53.440> they're

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
bring on the triple threat but they're

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.470 
bring on the triple threat but they're
pretty<00:03:54.460> close<00:03:54.610> to<00:03:54.700> us<00:03:54.910> on<00:03:55.000> goal<00:03:55.180> difference

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
pretty close to us on goal difference

00:03:59.730 --> 00:03:59.740 
third with a 16 on goal difference so

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.050 
third with a 16 on goal difference so
it's<00:03:59.860> still<00:04:00.040> pretty<00:04:00.160> tight<00:04:00.460> in<00:04:00.610> this<00:04:00.700> premier
