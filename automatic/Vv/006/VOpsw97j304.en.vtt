now instead of using a toothpick or too
fresh<00:01:25.690> like<00:01:26.680> part<00:01:27.310> three<00:01:27.640> in<00:01:28.410> this<00:01:29.410> tutorial

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
fresh like part three in this tutorial

fresh like part three in this tutorial
I'm<00:01:30.790> using<00:01:31.030> a<00:01:31.360> ball<00:01:31.540> of<00:01:31.690> foil<00:01:31.930> to<00:01:32.560> texture<00:01:33.130> the

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
I'm using a ball of foil to texture the

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:40.770 
I'm using a ball of foil to texture the
cake<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:38.580> make<00:01:39.580> sure<00:01:39.610> the<00:01:39.970> entire<00:01:40.300> thing<00:01:40.600> is

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
cake so make sure the entire thing is

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.810 
cake so make sure the entire thing is
textured<00:01:42.780> next<00:01:43.780> you'll<00:01:43.930> want<00:01:44.020> to<00:01:44.290> use<00:01:44.410> a<00:01:45.010> light

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
textured next you'll want to use a light

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.710 
textured next you'll want to use a light
brown<00:01:46.060> and<00:01:46.450> a<00:01:46.510> dark<00:01:46.780> brown<00:01:47.050> top<00:01:47.740> color<00:01:48.070> and

brush the lighter brown color over you

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.180 
brush the lighter brown color over you
can<00:01:55.150> do<00:01:55.300> the<00:01:55.420> entire<00:01:55.570> thing<00:01:56.050> but<00:01:56.320> the<00:01:56.590> bottom

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
can do the entire thing but the bottom

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.090 
can do the entire thing but the bottom
of<00:01:57.490> the<00:01:58.450> cake<00:01:58.660> will<00:01:58.900> have<00:01:58.930> the<00:01:59.410> dark<00:01:59.830> brown

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
of the cake will have the dark brown

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:17.660 
of the cake will have the dark brown
color

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.470 

so<00:02:18.270> make<00:02:18.480> sure<00:02:18.510> it's<00:02:19.140> really<00:02:19.350> dark<00:02:20.240> that<00:02:21.240> it

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
so make sure it's really dark that it

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.000 
so make sure it's really dark that it
has<00:02:21.630> a<00:02:21.660> different<00:02:22.080> color<00:02:22.200> than<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.560> rest<00:02:22.860> of

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
has a different color than the rest of

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.880 
has a different color than the rest of
the<00:02:23.130> cake

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.199 

then<00:02:30.890> you'll<00:02:31.069> end<00:02:31.250> up<00:02:31.370> with<00:02:31.610> something<00:02:32.060> like

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
then you'll end up with something like

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.140 
then you'll end up with something like
that<00:02:32.270> and<00:02:32.770> you<00:02:33.770> can<00:02:34.310> see<00:02:34.490> the<00:02:34.640> bottom<00:02:34.970> is

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
that and you can see the bottom is

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.290 
that and you can see the bottom is
darker<00:02:35.569> than<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:35.810> rest<00:02:36.790> next<00:02:37.790> step

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
darker than the rest next step

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.320 
darker than the rest next step
roll<00:02:39.080> out<00:02:39.110> the<00:02:39.350> frosting<00:02:40.069> color<00:02:40.520> and<00:02:40.819> a<00:02:41.090> thin

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
roll out the frosting color and a thin

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.120 
roll out the frosting color and a thin
sheet<00:02:41.600> and<00:02:41.920> cut<00:02:42.920> it<00:02:43.069> to<00:02:43.280> size<00:02:44.770> this<00:02:45.770> will<00:02:45.980> be

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
sheet and cut it to size this will be

00:02:46.130 --> 00:03:08.300 
sheet and cut it to size this will be
going<00:02:46.310> on<00:02:46.520> the<00:02:46.580> top

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.650 

once<00:03:08.910> you<00:03:09.060> get<00:03:09.209> it<00:03:09.360> on<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:10.260> top<00:03:11.480> use<00:03:12.480> your

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
once you get it on the top use your

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:20.150 
once you get it on the top use your
fingers<00:03:13.020> to<00:03:13.050> press<00:03:13.500> it<00:03:13.740> down<00:03:18.470> so<00:03:19.470> it<00:03:19.680> fits<00:03:19.709> to

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
fingers to press it down so it fits to

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:28.550 
fingers to press it down so it fits to
the<00:03:20.280> shape<00:03:26.030> then<00:03:27.030> any<00:03:27.360> excess<00:03:28.050> that<00:03:28.080> you<00:03:28.350> don't

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
the shape then any excess that you don't

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:55.220 
the shape then any excess that you don't
want<00:03:28.770> on<00:03:29.010> there<00:03:29.220> you<00:03:29.430> can<00:03:29.580> just<00:03:29.640> trim<00:03:30.000> it<00:03:30.090> off

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.640 

now<00:03:55.830> using<00:03:56.099> a<00:03:56.430> blade<00:03:56.819> tool<00:03:57.510> or<00:03:58.200> something

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
now using a blade tool or something

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.860 
now using a blade tool or something
that's<00:03:58.830> really<00:03:59.129> thin<00:04:00.590> press<00:04:01.590> some<00:04:02.870> straight

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
that's really thin press some straight

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:24.070 
that's really thin press some straight
lines<00:04:04.140> into<00:04:04.830> the<00:04:04.860> frosting

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:30.300 

and<00:04:24.620> then<00:04:24.889> there's<00:04:25.220> the<00:04:26.229> top<00:04:27.229> of<00:04:27.440> the<00:04:27.500> gate

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.760 

next<00:04:31.310> step<00:04:31.699> adds<00:04:31.970> some<00:04:32.539> indents<00:04:33.169> where<00:04:33.650> you

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
next step adds some indents where you

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.240 
next step adds some indents where you
want<00:04:33.949> the<00:04:34.220> cream<00:04:34.520> filling<00:04:34.789> to<00:04:35.150> go<00:04:35.620> I'm<00:04:36.620> using<00:04:36.979> a
