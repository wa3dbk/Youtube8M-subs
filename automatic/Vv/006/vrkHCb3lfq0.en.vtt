 control his pc to the voice so for 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:23.200
 this you have to download a 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:26.380
 jc folder except the foll attacks 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.689

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.660
 so it's very fast so I'm going 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.240
 not do any tutorial to install it because 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:51.040
 that I think it's good we do not have 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:52.480
 then need the software is available 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.810

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.680
 the free trial version and you 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.790
 can put that 20 comment on it 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.890
 so for that you will have to create 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.409
 a command which against the some 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.259
 something for example launched firefox 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:13.689
 So here I'm going to firefox 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:19.990
 will delete to recreate it excuse 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:24.509
 me here I am ordering us here I put 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.509
 launched firefox 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:32.170
 here it is now here I'm going to have to 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:34.240
 go in other be you want to do 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.630
 another thing for example I want you 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.899
 throw wanted to press a button that 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.119

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:46.149

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.459
 example you put yes here and you 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.159
 make 

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:56.100
 in theory if ordered by me by 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:59.049
 example to throw spint elsewhere there are 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.999
 a little thing that asks me if yes 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.039

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.280
 want you to say for sure 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.710
