proforms<00:00:15.809> this<00:00:16.260> is<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.820> moko<00:00:18.320> slim-fit<00:00:19.320> case

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
proforms this is the moko slim-fit case

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.080 
proforms this is the moko slim-fit case
for<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:19.890> surface<00:00:20.220> pro<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:22.550> like<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:23.730> think<00:00:24.000> it's

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
for the surface pro I like I think it's

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.210 
for the surface pro I like I think it's
a<00:00:24.180> case<00:00:24.330> I<00:00:24.539> mean<00:00:24.720> it's<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.470> is<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.619> folder<00:00:26.039> but

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
a case I mean it's it is a folder but

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.730 
a case I mean it's it is a folder but
you<00:00:26.670> can<00:00:26.789> see<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.119> it<00:00:27.210> does<00:00:27.650> protect<00:00:28.650> the

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
you can see that it does protect the

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.880 
you can see that it does protect the
corners<00:00:29.010> of<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.460> surface<00:00:30.529> with<00:00:31.529> these<00:00:31.679> big

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
corners of the surface with these big

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.549 
corners of the surface with these big
things<00:00:32.369> here<00:00:35.899> right<00:00:36.899> now<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:37.050> have<00:00:37.350> the

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
time I mean you can use the keyboard on

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.299 
time I mean you can use the keyboard on
the<00:01:02.190> grooves<00:01:02.460> if<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.420> want<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.899> but<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:05.159> does

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
have it a little bit of a lift so let me

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.929 
have it a little bit of a lift so let me
show<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:08.070> if<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.250> put<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.490> on<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.640> second

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
show you so if you put it on the second

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.190 
show you so if you put it on the second
groove<00:01:09.150> here<00:01:11.119> it's<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.270> tiny<00:01:12.540> bit<00:01:12.689> lifted<00:01:12.960> if

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
groove here it's a tiny bit lifted if

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.170 
groove here it's a tiny bit lifted if
you<00:01:13.320> can<00:01:13.470> see<00:01:13.680> right<00:01:13.710> here<00:01:13.979> just<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.880> very<00:01:15.090> tiny

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
you can see right here just a very tiny

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.480 
you can see right here just a very tiny
bit<00:01:16.130> but<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.189> can<00:01:17.220> still<00:01:17.520> use<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.729> just<00:01:18.030> fine

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
bit but you can still use it just fine

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.920 
bit but you can still use it just fine
it's<00:01:20.490> connected<00:01:21.090> or<00:01:21.210> it's<00:01:21.390> touching<00:01:21.840> the

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
it's connected or it's touching the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.260 
it's connected or it's touching the
ground<00:01:22.049> right<00:01:22.350> here<00:01:22.380> so<00:01:22.950> it's<00:01:23.310> pretty<00:01:23.580> firm<00:01:26.270> so

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
ground right here so it's pretty firm so

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.700 
ground right here so it's pretty firm so
you<00:01:27.360> can<00:01:27.630> use<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:27.990> here<00:01:28.200> it's<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.530> little

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
you can use that here it's a little

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.620 
you can use that here it's a little
bouncy<00:01:29.070> up<00:01:29.310> near<00:01:29.549> this<00:01:29.729> end<00:01:29.909> here<00:01:30.180> but<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.509> can

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
bouncy up near this end here but you can

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.490 
bouncy up near this end here but you can
type<00:01:30.810> on<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:30.990> just<00:01:31.229> fine<00:01:32.990> but<00:01:33.990> I<00:01:34.020> find<00:01:34.380> that

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
type on it just fine but I find that

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.609 
type on it just fine but I find that
that<00:01:34.770> while<00:01:35.070> either<00:01:35.400> I'm<00:01:35.610> on<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.880> desk<00:01:36.119> or<00:01:36.619> I'm

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
that while either I'm on the desk or I'm

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.789 
that while either I'm on the desk or I'm
on<00:01:37.799> my<00:01:37.979> bed<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.430> find<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.090> this<00:01:39.329> angle<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:40.020> nice

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
on my bed I find that this angle is nice

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.039 
on my bed I find that this angle is nice
to<00:01:41.220> use<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.700> on-screen<00:01:42.090> keyboard<00:01:42.299> feels

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
to use to the on-screen keyboard feels

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.410 
to use to the on-screen keyboard feels
good<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:44.009> keyboard<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.520> quite<00:01:44.640> good<00:01:44.970> so

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
good and the keyboard is quite good so

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.670 
good and the keyboard is quite good so
it's<00:01:45.659> up<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:45.990> can<00:01:46.140> use<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.409> like

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
it's up to you you can use that like

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.700 
it's up to you you can use that like
this<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.149> you<00:01:48.149> have<00:01:48.180> this<00:01:48.960> angle<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.619> then

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
this and you have this angle and then

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.530 
this and you have this angle and then
you<00:01:49.770> have<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.009> second<00:01:50.399> angle<00:01:50.670> which<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.270> find

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
you have the second angle which I find

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.490 
you have the second angle which I find
is<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.689> little<00:01:52.049> bit<00:01:52.170> more<00:01:53.119> stable<00:01:54.320> the<00:01:55.320> higher

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
is a little bit more stable the higher

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.830 
is a little bit more stable the higher
up<00:01:55.770> angle<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.880> little<00:01:56.969> bit<00:01:57.210> more<00:01:57.329> stable<00:01:57.570> on

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
up angle is a little bit more stable on

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.200 
up angle is a little bit more stable on
the<00:01:57.869> keyboard<00:01:58.460> it<00:01:59.460> does<00:01:59.640> have<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.880> little<00:02:00.090> bit

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
the keyboard it does have a little bit

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.749 
the keyboard it does have a little bit
of<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.450> lift<00:02:00.659> right<00:02:00.750> here<00:02:01.340> but<00:02:02.340> it's<00:02:02.579> not

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
of a lift right here but it's not

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.010 
of a lift right here but it's not
doesn't<00:02:03.000> seem<00:02:03.180> like<00:02:03.390> it's<00:02:03.509> that<00:02:03.659> much<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:03.840> a

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
doesn't seem like it's that much of a

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.620 
doesn't seem like it's that much of a
problem<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:04.649> still<00:02:05.399> use<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:05.640> sometimes<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.479> guess

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
problem I still use it sometimes I guess

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.740 
problem I still use it sometimes I guess
I<00:02:06.719> have<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.869> little<00:02:07.110> bit<00:02:07.200> of<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.320> problem

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
I have a little bit of a problem

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.359 
I have a little bit of a problem
my<00:02:07.840> right-click<00:02:08.440> on<00:02:08.649> the<00:02:08.740> keyboard<00:02:09.130> unless

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
my right-click on the keyboard unless

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.490 
my right-click on the keyboard unless
the<00:02:09.550> keyboard<00:02:09.910> is<00:02:09.970> completely<00:02:10.600> flat<00:02:10.840> I<00:02:11.110> find

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
the keyboard is completely flat I find

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.260 
the keyboard is completely flat I find
that<00:02:11.620> that's<00:02:11.770> just<00:02:11.950> a<00:02:12.070> design<00:02:12.640> problem<00:02:12.970> I

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
that that's just a design problem I

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.000 
that that's just a design problem I
guess<00:02:13.450> with<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:13.780> keyboard<00:02:14.970> so<00:02:15.970> in<00:02:16.390> other<00:02:16.750> ways

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
guess with the keyboard so in other ways

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.930 
guess with the keyboard so in other ways
you<00:02:18.010> can<00:02:18.310> flip<00:02:18.760> this<00:02:18.970> part<00:02:19.270> here<00:02:19.570> back<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:21.790> have

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
you can flip this part here back to have

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.820 
you can flip this part here back to have
it<00:02:22.060> flat<00:02:22.300> on<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.510> table<00:02:22.660> and<00:02:23.020> then<00:02:23.560> it<00:02:23.680> is

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
it flat on the table and then it is

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.980 
it flat on the table and then it is
adjustable<00:02:24.340> with<00:02:24.700> whatever<00:02:25.360> angle<00:02:25.690> that<00:02:25.840> you

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
adjustable with whatever angle that you

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.199 
adjustable with whatever angle that you
want<00:02:26.020> so<00:02:26.830> this<00:02:26.980> is<00:02:27.100> almost<00:02:27.280> pretty<00:02:27.670> much<00:02:27.820> you

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
want so this is almost pretty much you

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:29.699 
want so this is almost pretty much you
know<00:02:28.300> look<00:02:28.630> almost<00:02:28.990> pretty<00:02:29.320> much<00:02:29.410> vertical

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
know look almost pretty much vertical

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.310 
know look almost pretty much vertical
it's<00:02:30.430> pretty<00:02:30.610> stable<00:02:30.790> as<00:02:31.780> long<00:02:31.840> as<00:02:32.110> it<00:02:32.200> doesn't

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
it's pretty stable as long as it doesn't

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:40.530 
it's pretty stable as long as it doesn't
close<00:02:33.030> so<00:02:38.280> so<00:02:39.280> he<00:02:39.370> can<00:02:39.490> have<00:02:39.640> it<00:02:39.670> at<00:02:39.820> this<00:02:40.030> angle

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
close so so he can have it at this angle

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.740 
close so so he can have it at this angle
you<00:02:41.260> can<00:02:41.410> pull<00:02:41.620> it<00:02:41.739> out<00:02:41.860> and<00:02:42.250> you<00:02:42.370> can<00:02:42.489> have<00:02:42.550> it

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
you can pull it out and you can have it

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.280 
you can pull it out and you can have it
lower<00:02:43.750> like<00:02:44.050> this<00:02:45.270> and<00:02:46.270> like<00:02:46.510> I<00:02:46.600> said<00:02:46.660> as<00:02:46.900> long

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
lower like this and like I said as long

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.550 
lower like this and like I said as long
as<00:02:47.500> the<00:02:47.709> table<00:02:48.040> that<00:02:48.160> you're<00:02:48.280> using<00:02:48.820> it<00:02:49.060> on<00:02:49.560> you

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
as the table that you're using it on you

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.710 
as the table that you're using it on you
make<00:02:50.739> sure<00:02:50.770> that<00:02:51.070> this<00:02:51.310> is<00:02:51.520> down<00:02:51.700> it's<00:02:52.330> pretty

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
make sure that this is down it's pretty

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.800 
make sure that this is down it's pretty
it's<00:02:53.080> pretty<00:02:53.170> solid<00:02:53.620> I<00:02:53.980> mean<00:02:54.360> unless<00:02:55.360> it's<00:02:55.720> a

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
it's pretty solid I mean unless it's a

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.340 
it's pretty solid I mean unless it's a
really<00:02:56.940> slick<00:02:57.940> table<00:02:58.420> it's<00:02:58.690> not<00:02:58.900> gonna<00:02:59.110> fall

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
really slick table it's not gonna fall

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.300 
really slick table it's not gonna fall
back<00:03:01.170> especially<00:03:02.170> while<00:03:02.530> your<00:03:02.709> fingers<00:03:03.220> are

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
back especially while your fingers are

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.800 
back especially while your fingers are
on<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:03.459> key<00:03:03.610> book<00:03:03.820> here<00:03:04.030> so<00:03:04.209> you<00:03:04.510> can<00:03:04.660> pretty

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
on the key book here so you can pretty

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.360 
on the key book here so you can pretty
much<00:03:04.900> have<00:03:05.140> it<00:03:05.170> at<00:03:05.350> any<00:03:05.500> angle<00:03:05.709> you<00:03:05.890> want<00:03:06.190> you

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
much have it at any angle you want you

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.420 
much have it at any angle you want you
can<00:03:06.520> go<00:03:07.120> down<00:03:07.300> even<00:03:07.660> more<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:09.040> have<00:03:09.190> it<00:03:09.310> lay

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
can go down even more and have it lay

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.729 
can go down even more and have it lay
like<00:03:09.610> that<00:03:09.820> if<00:03:10.239> for<00:03:11.050> some<00:03:11.080> reason<00:03:11.410> you<00:03:11.470> want<00:03:11.680> it

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
like that if for some reason you want it

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.320 
like that if for some reason you want it
like<00:03:11.830> that<00:03:13.860> but<00:03:14.860> I<00:03:14.980> find<00:03:15.160> you<00:03:15.400> know<00:03:15.549> that<00:03:16.030> angle

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
like that but I find you know that angle

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:17.940 
like that but I find you know that angle
is<00:03:16.420> good<00:03:16.450> or<00:03:16.810> if<00:03:16.870> you're<00:03:17.290> in<00:03:17.410> front<00:03:17.590> of<00:03:17.650> it<00:03:17.769> more

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
is good or if you're in front of it more

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.280 
is good or if you're in front of it more
you<00:03:18.010> can<00:03:18.130> have<00:03:18.280> it<00:03:18.400> a<00:03:18.430> little<00:03:18.519> bit<00:03:18.640> up<00:03:19.170> so<00:03:20.170> that

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
you can have it a little bit up so that

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.789 
you can have it a little bit up so that
works<00:03:20.470> really<00:03:20.680> well<00:03:22.290> another<00:03:23.290> thing<00:03:23.410> that<00:03:23.709> it

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
works really well another thing that it

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:27.720 
works really well another thing that it
has<00:03:23.830> is<00:03:24.840> which<00:03:25.840> I<00:03:26.049> find<00:03:26.320> kind<00:03:26.500> of<00:03:26.590> useless<00:03:26.980> is

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
has is which I find kind of useless is

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.990 
has is which I find kind of useless is
when<00:03:28.090> its<00:03:28.209> flipped<00:03:28.420> if<00:03:28.780> you<00:03:29.230> flip<00:03:29.500> it<00:03:29.850> open<00:03:30.850> all

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
when its flipped if you flip it open all

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.440 
when its flipped if you flip it open all
the<00:03:31.180> way<00:03:31.330> so<00:03:32.049> that<00:03:32.080> your<00:03:32.380> surface<00:03:32.830> is<00:03:33.450> showing

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
the way so that your surface is showing

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.340 
the way so that your surface is showing
okay<00:03:34.750> I'll<00:03:34.870> take<00:03:34.989> a<00:03:35.049> keyboard<00:03:35.440> off<00:03:36.930> then<00:03:37.930> the

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
okay I'll take a keyboard off then the

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.470 
okay I'll take a keyboard off then the
back<00:03:38.530> cover<00:03:38.860> just<00:03:39.430> kind<00:03:39.670> of<00:03:39.700> like<00:03:39.850> it's<00:03:40.209> just

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
back cover just kind of like it's just

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.930 
back cover just kind of like it's just
kind<00:03:40.630> of<00:03:40.720> flopping<00:03:41.079> around<00:03:41.549> so<00:03:42.549> you<00:03:42.610> have<00:03:42.790> to

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
kind of flopping around so you have to

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:49.340 
kind of flopping around so you have to
use<00:03:43.209> the<00:03:45.329> you<00:03:46.329> have<00:03:46.450> to<00:03:46.600> use<00:03:46.780> the<00:03:47.670> strap<00:03:48.670> here

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
use the you have to use the strap here

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.100 
use the you have to use the strap here
to<00:03:50.350> hold<00:03:50.560> it<00:03:50.680> which<00:03:51.400> isn't<00:03:51.610> completely<00:03:52.239> stable

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
to hold it which isn't completely stable

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.430 
to hold it which isn't completely stable
I<00:03:53.350> mean<00:03:53.829> you<00:03:53.920> can<00:03:54.040> see<00:03:54.220> that<00:03:54.250> it's<00:03:55.290> kind<00:03:56.290> of

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
I mean you can see that it's kind of

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.729 
I mean you can see that it's kind of
moving<00:03:56.890> around<00:03:57.220> but<00:03:58.030> uh<00:03:58.060> and<00:03:58.840> then<00:03:59.560> there's

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
moving around but uh and then there's

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.890 
moving around but uh and then there's
this<00:03:59.860> handle<00:04:00.820> right<00:04:00.970> here<00:04:01.000> which<00:04:01.329> is<00:04:01.480> fine

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
this handle right here which is fine

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.650 
this handle right here which is fine
kind<00:04:02.200> of<00:04:02.260> useless<00:04:02.590> because<00:04:03.329> holding<00:04:04.329> the

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
kind of useless because holding the

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.700 
kind of useless because holding the
surface<00:04:05.110> in<00:04:05.230> front<00:04:05.470> of<00:04:05.560> you<00:04:05.650> like<00:04:05.680> this

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:07.710 
surface in front of you like this

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.560 
surface in front of you like this
you<00:04:07.980> know<00:04:08.100> it's<00:04:08.400> it's<00:04:09.120> not<00:04:09.210> a<00:04:09.390> completely

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
you know it's it's not a completely

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.900 
you know it's it's not a completely
straight<00:04:10.380> and<00:04:10.710> I<00:04:11.070> wouldn't<00:04:11.460> want<00:04:11.640> to<00:04:11.670> have<00:04:11.790> my

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
straight and I wouldn't want to have my

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.510 
straight and I wouldn't want to have my
elbow<00:04:12.270> in<00:04:12.420> my<00:04:12.450> stomach<00:04:12.840> here<00:04:13.140> hold<00:04:13.620> the<00:04:14.220> screen

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
elbow in my stomach here hold the screen

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.460 
elbow in my stomach here hold the screen
straight<00:04:14.820> so<00:04:15.060> while<00:04:15.210> my<00:04:15.330> arm<00:04:15.960> is<00:04:16.050> at<00:04:16.140> my<00:04:16.230> side

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
straight so while my arm is at my side

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.160 
straight so while my arm is at my side
here<00:04:16.830> it's<00:04:17.310> kind<00:04:17.520> of<00:04:17.610> at<00:04:17.730> like<00:04:17.910> a<00:04:18.080> 20<00:04:19.080> degree

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 
here it's kind of at like a 20 degree

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.020 
here it's kind of at like a 20 degree
angle<00:04:19.410> almost<00:04:19.920> like<00:04:20.220> you<00:04:20.730> know<00:04:20.820> it's<00:04:20.910> supposed

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
angle almost like you know it's supposed

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.090 
angle almost like you know it's supposed
to<00:04:21.210> be<00:04:21.300> like<00:04:21.390> this<00:04:21.630> when<00:04:22.590> you're<00:04:22.680> holding<00:04:23.010> it

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
to be like this when you're holding it

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.380 
to be like this when you're holding it
it's<00:04:23.250> more<00:04:23.520> like<00:04:23.670> this<00:04:23.850> in<00:04:24.030> front<00:04:24.240> of<00:04:24.300> your

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
it's more like this in front of your

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.920 
it's more like this in front of your
face<00:04:24.600> so<00:04:24.890> I<00:04:26.000> don't<00:04:27.000> really<00:04:27.120> see<00:04:27.330> the<00:04:27.480> use<00:04:27.660> of

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
face so I don't really see the use of

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.990 
face so I don't really see the use of
the<00:04:28.280> handle<00:04:29.280> here<00:04:29.430> unless<00:04:29.550> maybe<00:04:29.820> you're

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
the handle here unless maybe you're

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.340 
the handle here unless maybe you're
walking<00:04:30.300> around<00:04:30.390> and<00:04:30.690> you<00:04:30.810> just<00:04:30.960> want<00:04:31.170> to<00:04:31.200> have

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
walking around and you just want to have

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.320 
walking around and you just want to have
a<00:04:31.380> little<00:04:31.830> bit<00:04:31.950> of<00:04:31.980> stability<00:04:32.190> you<00:04:32.730> can<00:04:33.030> walk

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
a little bit of stability you can walk

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.800 
a little bit of stability you can walk
around<00:04:33.480> like<00:04:33.750> this<00:04:33.930> with<00:04:34.320> it<00:04:35.090> or<00:04:36.090> maybe<00:04:36.660> if

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
around like this with it or maybe if

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.810 
around like this with it or maybe if
you're<00:04:36.900> using<00:04:37.140> it<00:04:37.350> in<00:04:37.530> landscape<00:04:38.220> mode<00:04:38.520> you

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
you're using it in landscape mode you

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.100 
you're using it in landscape mode you
can<00:04:38.940> kind<00:04:39.150> of<00:04:39.180> have<00:04:39.300> your<00:04:39.390> fingers<00:04:39.750> dangling

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
can kind of have your fingers dangling

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.440 
can kind of have your fingers dangling
out<00:04:40.290> of<00:04:40.320> it<00:04:40.530> a<00:04:40.560> little<00:04:40.800> bit<00:04:40.890> to<00:04:41.850> hold<00:04:42.060> it<00:04:42.240> to

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
out of it a little bit to hold it to

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.380 
out of it a little bit to hold it to
give<00:04:42.600> you<00:04:42.690> some<00:04:42.870> more<00:04:43.050> support<00:04:44.300> so<00:04:45.300> that's

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
give you some more support so that's

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.060 
give you some more support so that's
pretty<00:04:45.690> nice<00:04:45.840> I<00:04:46.050> guess<00:04:46.110> I<00:04:46.230> don't<00:04:46.680> really<00:04:46.830> use

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
pretty nice I guess I don't really use

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:52.460 
pretty nice I guess I don't really use
that<00:04:47.220> feature<00:04:47.430> of<00:04:47.700> it<00:04:51.080> so<00:04:52.080> but<00:04:52.230> you<00:04:52.320> can<00:04:52.380> see

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
that feature of it so but you can see

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.890 
that feature of it so but you can see
that<00:04:52.740> it<00:04:52.890> it<00:04:53.040> it<00:04:53.400> clips<00:04:53.730> on<00:04:54.000> to<00:04:54.270> all<00:04:54.630> four

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
that it it it clips on to all four

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.560 
that it it it clips on to all four
corners<00:04:55.290> of<00:04:55.410> the<00:04:55.500> surface<00:04:56.240> so<00:04:57.240> and<00:04:57.480> they're

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
corners of the surface so and they're

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.710 
corners of the surface so and they're
pretty<00:04:57.750> big<00:04:58.670> so<00:04:59.670> you<00:04:59.850> know<00:04:59.910> maybe<00:05:00.210> the<00:05:00.330> sides

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
pretty big so you know maybe the sides

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.840 
pretty big so you know maybe the sides
aren't<00:05:01.080> completely<00:05:01.560> protected<00:05:04.640> but<00:05:05.640> these

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
aren't completely protected but these

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.590 
aren't completely protected but these
guys<00:05:06.060> are<00:05:06.270> pretty<00:05:06.450> thick<00:05:06.810> so<00:05:08.120> and<00:05:09.120> then<00:05:09.420> of

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
guys are pretty thick so and then of

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.630 
guys are pretty thick so and then of
course<00:05:09.660> it<00:05:09.990> has<00:05:10.020> a<00:05:10.140> stylus<00:05:10.920> holder<00:05:11.220> right<00:05:11.340> here

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
course it has a stylus holder right here

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.190 
course it has a stylus holder right here
so<00:05:12.030> you<00:05:12.090> can<00:05:12.150> slide<00:05:12.450> your<00:05:12.480> stylus<00:05:12.990> and<00:05:13.110> the

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
so you can slide your stylus and the

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.960 
so you can slide your stylus and the
only<00:05:13.320> problem<00:05:13.680> I<00:05:13.740> find<00:05:13.890> with<00:05:14.010> that<00:05:14.250> is<00:05:14.640> that<00:05:14.880> if

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
only problem I find with that is that if

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.670 
only problem I find with that is that if
you<00:05:15.090> want<00:05:15.330> if<00:05:15.600> you<00:05:15.810> have<00:05:15.900> your<00:05:16.050> stylus<00:05:16.470> there

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
you want if you have your stylus there

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.040 
you want if you have your stylus there
and<00:05:16.860> you<00:05:17.190> want<00:05:17.460> to<00:05:17.640> flip<00:05:18.210> it<00:05:18.360> open<00:05:18.660> all<00:05:18.780> the<00:05:18.900> way

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
and you want to flip it open all the way

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.190 
and you want to flip it open all the way
and<00:05:19.350> hold<00:05:20.130> it<00:05:20.340> then<00:05:20.820> your<00:05:21.600> back<00:05:21.750> cover<00:05:22.050> is

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
and hold it then your back cover is

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.650 
and hold it then your back cover is
gonna<00:05:22.290> be<00:05:22.530> open<00:05:22.890> a<00:05:22.950> little<00:05:23.070> bit<00:05:23.190> and<00:05:23.520> not<00:05:24.360> very

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
gonna be open a little bit and not very

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.900 
gonna be open a little bit and not very
good<00:05:24.840> because<00:05:25.290> the<00:05:25.680> stylus<00:05:26.460> is<00:05:26.580> gonna<00:05:26.760> be

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
good because the stylus is gonna be

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.280 
good because the stylus is gonna be
inside<00:05:27.210> there<00:05:27.800> so<00:05:29.000> but<00:05:30.000> all-in-all<00:05:30.210> I<00:05:30.750> enjoy

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.290 
inside there so but all-in-all I enjoy

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:32.720 
inside there so but all-in-all I enjoy
the<00:05:31.440> case<00:05:31.620> I<00:05:31.800> really<00:05:31.920> like<00:05:32.220> it<00:05:32.370> when<00:05:32.460> you're<00:05:32.610> on

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:32.730 
the case I really like it when you're on

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:37.580 
the case I really like it when you're on
the<00:05:32.820> bed<00:05:34.010> you<00:05:35.010> can<00:05:35.040> have<00:05:35.340> it<00:05:35.490> on<00:05:35.610> on<00:05:36.200> the<00:05:37.200> second

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590 
the bed you can have it on on the second

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.410 
the bed you can have it on on the second
groove<00:05:37.800> here<00:05:38.130> and<00:05:38.400> it's<00:05:38.670> such<00:05:38.820> a<00:05:38.850> low<00:05:39.150> angle

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:39.420 
groove here and it's such a low angle

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.420 
groove here and it's such a low angle
and<00:05:40.290> it's<00:05:40.800> something<00:05:40.920> you<00:05:41.040> can<00:05:41.070> put<00:05:41.310> it<00:05:41.370> on

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
and it's something you can put it on

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.760 
and it's something you can put it on
your<00:05:41.580> lap<00:05:41.730> pretty<00:05:42.330> stable<00:05:42.570> the<00:05:43.260> bottom<00:05:43.560> part

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
your lap pretty stable the bottom part

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.380 
your lap pretty stable the bottom part
is<00:05:43.800> not<00:05:43.980> flimsy<00:05:44.220> at<00:05:44.460> all<00:05:44.580> so<00:05:44.790> I<00:05:44.820> can<00:05:45.030> I<00:05:45.090> can<00:05:45.240> pick

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:45.390 
is not flimsy at all so I can I can pick

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.690 
is not flimsy at all so I can I can pick
it<00:05:45.510> up<00:05:45.600> from<00:05:45.750> this<00:05:46.020> and<00:05:46.950> if<00:05:47.070> I<00:05:47.190> have<00:05:47.370> it<00:05:47.400> on<00:05:47.580> my

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:47.700 
it up from this and if I have it on my

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.390 
it up from this and if I have it on my
lap<00:05:47.910> even<00:05:48.150> on<00:05:48.780> a<00:05:48.840> chair<00:05:49.350> it's<00:05:50.010> a<00:05:50.070> really

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
lap even on a chair it's a really

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.270 
lap even on a chair it's a really
perfect<00:05:50.760> angle<00:05:51.090> for<00:05:51.120> typing<00:05:51.770> so<00:05:52.770> I<00:05:52.800> can<00:05:53.100> have<00:05:53.250> a

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
perfect angle for typing so I can have a

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.680 
perfect angle for typing so I can have a
right<00:05:53.520> front<00:05:53.790> of<00:05:53.820> me<00:05:53.910> on<00:05:53.970> my<00:05:54.060> lap<00:05:54.270> I<00:05:54.450> don't<00:05:54.480> have

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
right front of me on my lap I don't have

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.150 
right front of me on my lap I don't have
to<00:05:54.780> have<00:05:54.900> the<00:05:54.990> keyboard<00:05:55.410> here<00:05:55.650> which<00:05:55.800> takes<00:05:55.980> up

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 
to have the keyboard here which takes up

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.310

viewing<00:06:02.160> angle<00:06:02.640> so<00:06:03.210> and<00:06:03.630> the<00:06:03.810> second<00:06:04.170> angle

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:04.410 
viewing angle so and the second angle

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.650 
viewing angle so and the second angle
it's<00:06:04.560> okay<00:06:04.890> a<00:06:05.130> little<00:06:05.520> bit<00:06:05.730> higher<00:06:05.850> up<00:06:06.120> this
