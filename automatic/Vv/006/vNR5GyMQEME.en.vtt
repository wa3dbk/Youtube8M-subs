00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.160
 good afternoon today we will talk 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.859
 about chic knitting is such a technique 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.179
 multicolor knitting which when 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.790
 which see the pattern line up with 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.190
 face side and seamy side 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.010
 It takes on this form, that is, it is not 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.430
 used color on seamy side 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:22.020
 stretch like this 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:27.050
 the most important task with this technique 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.970
 it's not tangled in the strings since 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.859
 we will have 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.780
 then up then down then up then down, we 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.180
 should take as a rule one color from us 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.610
 will have to go top other 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.649
 below here suppose dark color will be 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.660
 pass the top no matter 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.969
 the front row or purl will be 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.920
 strictly follow this rule now 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.410
 it means we knit edge loops 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.949
 the threads of both colors here we have 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:59.670
 such a pigtail is formed along the edge so 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:04.860
 we knit the first loop with them 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:08.760
 I have 16 light loops on my pattern 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.530
 to be because if we donâ€™t have that color 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.680
 use dark we will get very 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.970
 big broach on seamy side 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.560
 so a few places should have her 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.380
 intercept the main thread now I 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:24.350
 I will show you how we do it. 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:31.340
 will be every four five loops 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:34.759
 it means we pick up the worker thread and 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.759
 continue knitting 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:43.220
 after a few loops we return 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:46.200
 opposite direction 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:49.649
 our unused not all of it we already 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.040
 five times confused and continue working 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.040
 a thread 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:07.860
 knitting control the tension 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:10.289
 so that the canvas is not stretched and so 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.410
 does not mean white when we do not 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:16.950
 use we leave it dark below 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.750
 color we carry out the canvas right here 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.890
 hand fix to you 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.760
 distensibility was normal and here is the arm 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.209
 You are holding 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.209
 strings 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:38.000
 so knit dark color left 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:43.420
 the thread on top lifted light now 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.420
 light leave below raise dark 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:03:00.469
 dark leave the top of the bottom raise 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:03:02.689
 light light bottom dark top then 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:07.220
 have to abide by this rule and then your 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:10.129
 the threads won't get tangled by many scares 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:14.659
 jacquard just so you can get confused 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:18.069
 my glomeruli here I have 8 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:21.470
 you can intercept unused thread 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:23.299
 so we have broach see big not 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.049
 It turned out this is what it looks like with 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.049
 seamy side 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.970
 we will knit the last loop 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.160
 wallpaper colors that is, we again hand 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.480
 we fix so that we do not sag 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.280
 strings control this process 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.840
 at first it will seem difficult then 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.490
 so involve it won't 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:57.660
 cause problems all facial range 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:59.910
 knit so jacquard facial patterns 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.340
 rows we read from right to left 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.110
 purl rows opposite left to right 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.540
 that is, now we move to the next 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.380
 row and knit, we will read 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.160
 eyelets 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:15.810
 opposite direction first loop 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:21.200
 we shoot that we knit with both 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:21.200
 flowers so now we have a pattern 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:31.670
 6 whites one thread already knit 23 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.440
 6 so that the edge is not strapped we check 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.150
 to our 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:47.040
 unused threads are not tightened 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:48.870
 canvas and fix finger so white 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.930
 the thread goes down now we have to 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:54.350
 knit a dark color so a minute and 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.350
 jester 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.580
 three loops 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:06.790
 dark leave light on top passes 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.790
 below 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:23.820
 and so on, that is , he follows the rules 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.690
 we will get such smooth 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.570
 broach 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.860
 I also wanted to give some recommendations 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.500
 when knitting 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:34.920
 chic try to avoid excess seams 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:37.620
 if you knit a sleeve, knit better 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:39.720
 round instead of seam can be knit 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.560
 here's one purl loop 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:45.540
 the place of the seam as it passes smoothly and 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.430
 you won't have any problems in the first place 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.290
 you will not need edge knit 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:53.520
 that is, the canvas in a circle all the extra seams 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:55.200
 no, it's easier after washing 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.270
 you still have enough loops 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.160
 level up see everything neatly 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.640
 it becomes and therefore will not be the same 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.640
 go-karts
