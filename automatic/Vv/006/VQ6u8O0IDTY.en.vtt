 maximum winds now of 75 kings of 95 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.850
 and it is expected it is expected to continue 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.410
 adding a lot of cloudiness to this 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.000
 region of the Mexican republic what 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.160

 earth stream will touch the north coast 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:56.449
 of Veracruz and the south of the state of Samoa 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:58.819
 liberia between tampico and also there 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:01.249
 we can expect this system to arrive 

00:00:58.819 --> 00:01:03.859
 to the Mexican coast rains and more 

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:05.960
 rains on the other hand we will expect the 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:07.760
 norbeto be you noble that is also 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.000
 a tropical storm that it contains in its 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.820
 trip north and north reason of 15 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.940
 kilometers per hour 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.830
 the maximum of 65 streaks of 85 kilos 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.890
 extra continue also contributing up 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.650
 have a city south to the west and to 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.450
 north of the Pacific littoral with 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.540
 precipitations that can become 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.360
 strong and intense from the south of 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.550
 sound to the state of eua harakiri 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.530
 yes all these all the functions of

 precipitation really very but very 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.150
 abundant while temperatures 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.130
 they are sweet we continue with very hot temperatures

 the 45 degrees so we will wait for rains 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.640
 throughout this great region the influx of 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.440
 humidity the nearness of huge for what 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.170
 what is this area that will be followed 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.030
 contributing quite enough cloudiness and 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.430

 electrical activity temperatures by 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.890
 course for this big cloud ceiling 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.050
 they descend slightly and we will wait 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.780
 that are only warm values ​​and in 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.240
 some hot points 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.700
 temperature value for this region of

 become strong to very strong the 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.290
 south of the center table we continue with 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.819
 cloudy electrical activity towards the 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.010
 south of the mexican republic ok you 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.410

 from 31 to 35 degrees of that 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.060
 electrical activity and possibility 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.320
 also of hail the southeast on this 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.570
 will also continue to contribute 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.660
 Precipitation temperatures can 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.760
 reach up to 36 degrees 37 in this 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.140
 in that very warm region the southeast 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.760

 cleared will take advantage so that the 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.600
 solar revision is intense and so 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.560
 both are programmed in temperatures 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.690
