mineral oil a woodblock oil
okay<00:00:21.840> now<00:00:22.439> this<00:00:22.920> oil<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.550> special<00:00:24.150> oil<00:00:24.359> it's

a mineral oil and a food-grade oil you

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.320 
a mineral oil and a food-grade oil you
never<00:00:27.720> want<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.289> use<00:00:28.380> vegetable<00:00:29.279> oil<00:00:29.429> extra

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330

the wood this mineral oil will preserve
the<00:00:42.420> wood<00:00:42.600> especially<00:00:43.200> if<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.440> use<00:00:43.770> if<00:00:44.460> you

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
the wood especially if you use if you

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.930 
the wood especially if you use if you
clean<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.960> water<00:00:46.620> your<00:00:46.920> board<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.340> lot<00:00:47.520> water

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
clean and water your board a lot water

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.060 
clean and water your board a lot water
can<00:00:48.270> work<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.840> wood<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.500> that's<00:00:49.680> what<00:00:49.890> this

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
can work the wood and that's what this

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.740 
can work the wood and that's what this
prevents<00:00:50.550> prevents<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.329> from<00:00:51.420> warping

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
cracking you know bending and this board

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.970 
cracking you know bending and this board

a paper towel you want to generously put
your<00:01:16.290> oil<00:01:16.320> on<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:17.310> board<00:01:17.549> as<00:01:17.759> such<00:01:18.409> and<00:01:19.409> we're

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
going to go ahead and work it in with

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.050 
going to go ahead and work it in with
the<00:01:21.869> grain<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:23.570> wood<00:01:24.680> not<00:01:25.680> only<00:01:26.070> does<00:01:27.030> it

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
the grain of the wood not only does it

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.840 
the grain of the wood not only does it
preserve<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.810> wood<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.350> makes<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.520> board

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
preserve the wood it makes the board

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.300 
preserve the wood it makes the board
look<00:01:30.180> beautiful<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.590> really<00:01:31.799> brings<00:01:32.159> out

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
look beautiful and it really brings out

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.069 
look beautiful and it really brings out
the<00:01:32.369> natural<00:01:32.729> grain<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:34.100> the<00:01:35.100> wood

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
the natural grain of the wood

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.740 
the natural grain of the wood
but<00:01:37.079> again<00:01:37.820> preserving<00:01:38.820> your<00:01:38.850> wood<00:01:39.210> board<00:01:39.509> is

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
but again preserving your wood board is

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.670 
but again preserving your wood board is
so<00:01:40.110> important<00:01:41.840> wood<00:01:42.840> blocks<00:01:43.170> are<00:01:43.470> very

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
so important wood blocks are very

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.399 
so important wood blocks are very
expensive<00:01:44.310> these<00:01:44.430> days<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:46.020> don't<00:01:46.200> want

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
expensive these days and you don't want

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.410 
expensive these days and you don't want
to<00:01:46.470> keep<00:01:46.649> on<00:01:46.860> repurchasing<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:48.030> wood<00:01:48.270> block

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
to keep on repurchasing a wood block

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.780 
to keep on repurchasing a wood block
when<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.560> can<00:01:49.770> preserve<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.340> one<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.579> have

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
when you can preserve the one you have

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.929 
when you can preserve the one you have
for<00:01:51.299> years<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.720> come<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:52.350> know<00:01:53.280> I've<00:01:53.520> had<00:01:53.700> mine
