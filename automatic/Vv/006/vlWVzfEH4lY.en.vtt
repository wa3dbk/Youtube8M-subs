 Hi everybody, from the direct tank, that's okay. 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.690
 The tip of today's ep is Jack 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.580
 elton ski is a very good app he 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.690
 adds a lot of functions to your 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.509
 smartphone 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.520
 some in gps and others only your 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.180
 device itself so let's 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.750
 over there 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.630
 the first function is the compass you can 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.170
 use compass this way a compass in 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.520
 3d certain its classic taboo that the 2 of 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.590
 The device is thus 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.899
 uses the classic compass way is 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.320
 very sensitive this data that it reflects 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.600
 here it depends purely on your right gps 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.250
 and the internal search of the device 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.570
 and that you are in an open place the 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.750
 result is better than a local 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.950
 where they have electromagnetic fields 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.149
 metal to interfere with this result 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.489
 on here 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.489
 it also has the option of giving you the 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.010
 tilt the device so you know 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.590
 If the profiles are level, do not 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.840
 putting a picture on the wall is very useful 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.220
 for you who want to know the level of 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.950
 something 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.860
 location based on elite gps 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.470
 precision latitude longitude is well 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.560
 useful also if you want this data 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.090
 you can define your base and define 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.939
 as the base where I am 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:25.200
 so I'm a meter from myself 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:27.750
 Alright then I can give 172 location 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.280
 save and when it was gone it goes 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.770
 say how many meters all my 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.490
 camping is easier to return to 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.530
 local 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.119
 he knows my attitude because gps already 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.150
 information of the device 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.060
 it shows in this on a very legal scale 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.939
 here the speed the same GPS speaks 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.159
 for him this and here he puts it from a 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.560
 graphic form on the speedometer we are 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.470
 currently has no data 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.799
 it also has a sound scale is well 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.960
 interesting it makes the sound curve 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:00.360
 then you are seeing is the very practical 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.579
 settings chooses if you want more 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.170
 or less medical unit data in the 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.439
 United States you choose these 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.379
 details of the device and recommend 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.879
 buy the course, but I'm 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.740
 talking free of charge that the one you 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:17.220
 you see and she does everything 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.860
 This was infinitely I already think 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.180
 excellent for my use the jec tons 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.500
 free 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.110
 I'll leave the link in the video description 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.170
 of course and this is what this application does 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.270
 pretty thing i mean valley download 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.560
 adds a lot of functions in your 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.630
 smartphone 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.370
 then until the next tank video 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:40.820
 direct personal I hope you have enjoyed 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.820
 and until the next tip of ep and by staff
