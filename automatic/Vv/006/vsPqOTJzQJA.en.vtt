00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 
you want to do is unclamp the clamp for

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.340 
you want to do is unclamp the clamp for
the<00:00:35.590> intake<00:00:35.920> boot<00:00:36.539> after<00:00:37.539> you<00:00:37.660> do<00:00:37.780> that<00:00:37.809> go

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
the intake boot after you do that go

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.000 
the intake boot after you do that go
through<00:00:39.219> and<00:00:39.520> undo<00:00:40.300> all<00:00:41.199> the<00:00:41.500> bolts<00:00:41.770> that<00:00:41.860> hold

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
through and undo all the bolts that hold

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.680 
through and undo all the bolts that hold
the<00:00:42.190> intake<00:00:42.489> down<00:00:42.699> that's<00:00:43.059> the<00:00:43.210> ones<00:00:43.420> that<00:00:43.600> are

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
the intake down that's the ones that are

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.420 
the intake down that's the ones that are
going<00:00:43.840> across<00:00:44.170> here<00:00:44.620> there's<00:00:44.980> one<00:00:45.160> that's

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
going across here there's one that's

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.880 
going across here there's one that's
hiding<00:00:45.610> underneath<00:00:46.090> the<00:00:46.500> throttle<00:00:47.500> cables

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
hiding underneath the throttle cables

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.590 
hiding underneath the throttle cables
here<00:00:48.070> I<00:00:48.250> do<00:00:48.399> like<00:00:48.730> that<00:00:48.760> least<00:00:49.149> throttle

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
here I do like that least throttle

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.090 
here I do like that least throttle
cables<00:00:49.960> instead<00:00:50.199> of<00:00:50.410> the<00:00:50.469> fly-by-wire<00:00:50.710> I

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
cables instead of the fly-by-wire I

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.819 
cables instead of the fly-by-wire I
think<00:00:51.489> that's<00:00:51.820> a<00:00:51.940> lot<00:00:52.059> better<00:00:52.300> design<00:00:52.739> so<00:00:53.739> you

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
think that's a lot better design so you

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.869 
think that's a lot better design so you
pull<00:00:54.129> those<00:00:54.309> off<00:00:54.519> the<00:00:55.269> latest<00:00:55.719> aside<00:00:56.879> where

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
pull those off the latest aside where

00:00:57.879 --> 00:00:59.819 
pull those off the latest aside where
you<00:00:58.059> do<00:00:58.210> that<00:00:58.390> there's<00:00:58.809> a<00:00:59.230> bunch<00:00:59.590> of<00:00:59.710> different

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
you do that there's a bunch of different

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.099 
you do that there's a bunch of different
vacuum<00:01:00.399> lines<00:01:00.670> you've<00:01:00.969> got<00:01:01.179> the<00:01:01.359> line<00:01:01.570> for<00:01:01.960> the

00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:02.109 
vacuum lines you've got the line for the

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:04.500 
vacuum lines you've got the line for the
brake<00:01:02.289> booster<00:01:02.530> comes<00:01:03.399> off<00:01:03.579> of<00:01:03.760> here<00:01:04.000> you've

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
brake booster comes off of here you've

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.469 
brake booster comes off of here you've
got<00:01:04.780> the<00:01:04.930> line<00:01:05.199> here<00:01:05.590> for<00:01:05.619> the<00:01:05.890> cruise<00:01:06.130> control

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
got the line here for the cruise control

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.780 
got the line here for the cruise control
comes<00:01:07.479> off<00:01:07.720> next<00:01:08.110> door<00:01:08.320> and<00:01:08.560> then<00:01:09.430> you<00:01:09.460> also

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
comes off next door and then you also

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.820 
comes off next door and then you also
have<00:01:10.210> the<00:01:10.390> EGR<00:01:10.900> tube<00:01:10.930> that<00:01:11.350> you<00:01:11.409> get<00:01:11.560> out<00:01:11.710> and

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
have the EGR tube that you get out and

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.520 
have the EGR tube that you get out and
do<00:01:11.920> its<00:01:12.070> couple<00:01:12.430> at<00:01:12.549> eight<00:01:12.670> millimeter<00:01:13.180> heads

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
do its couple at eight millimeter heads

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.350 
do its couple at eight millimeter heads
then<00:01:14.530> you've<00:01:14.799> got<00:01:15.040> your<00:01:15.369> idle<00:01:15.970> air<00:01:16.330> control

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
then you've got your idle air control

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.410 
then you've got your idle air control
motor<00:01:17.049> you<00:01:17.650> want<00:01:17.890> to<00:01:17.950> unplug<00:01:18.220> that<00:01:18.310> and<00:01:18.790> then

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
motor you want to unplug that and then

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.870 
motor you want to unplug that and then
also<00:01:19.750> your<00:01:20.409> throttle<00:01:20.950> position<00:01:21.100> sensors

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
also your throttle position sensors

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.630 
also your throttle position sensors
below<00:01:22.240> that<00:01:22.479> one<00:01:22.750> run<00:01:22.990> plug<00:01:23.229> in<00:01:23.409> as<00:01:23.530> well<00:01:23.770> on

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
and you take the whole thing you lay it

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.770 
and you take the whole thing you lay it
up<00:01:45.009> aside<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:48.520> you<00:01:49.119> can<00:01:49.240> just<00:01:49.420> lay<00:01:49.630> it

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
up aside that you can just lay it

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.590 
up aside that you can just lay it
straight<00:01:49.960> up<00:01:50.229> you<00:01:50.860> can<00:01:51.040> see<00:01:51.219> on<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:52.299> front

here you've got a couple of bolts that
hold<00:01:54.579> it<00:01:54.790> in<00:01:54.909> here<00:01:55.320> just<00:01:56.320> to<00:01:56.469> support<00:01:56.740> the

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
hold it in here just to support the

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:57.899 
hold it in here just to support the
weight<00:01:57.040> of<00:01:57.070> it<00:01:57.369> and<00:01:57.520> then<00:01:57.610> you've<00:01:57.729> got<00:01:57.880> another

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
weight of it and then you've got another

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.690 
weight of it and then you've got another
bolt<00:01:58.390> here<00:01:58.750> for<00:01:59.049> your<00:01:59.200> oil<00:01:59.229> dipstick<00:01:59.649> tube<00:02:00.100> it

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
bolt here for your oil dipstick tube it

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.090 
bolt here for your oil dipstick tube it
goes<00:02:01.270> in<00:02:01.450> from<00:02:01.630> this<00:02:01.780> side<00:02:01.840> and<00:02:02.380> then<00:02:02.950> you've

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
goes in from this side and then you've

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.730 
goes in from this side and then you've
got<00:02:03.250> a<00:02:03.280> couple<00:02:03.549> here<00:02:03.969> in<00:02:04.000> here<00:02:04.420> near<00:02:05.409> the<00:02:05.560> oil

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
got a couple here in here near the oil

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.700 
got a couple here in here near the oil
fill<00:02:06.070> and<00:02:06.340> another<00:02:07.090> one<00:02:07.390> that<00:02:07.630> will<00:02:08.170> twist<00:02:08.410> out

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
fill and another one that will twist out

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:09.930 
fill and another one that will twist out
of<00:02:08.860> the<00:02:08.920> way<00:02:09.009> this<00:02:09.190> goes<00:02:09.340> on<00:02:09.520> top<00:02:09.700> of<00:02:09.880> the

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
of the way this goes on top of the

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.780 
of the way this goes on top of the
manifold<00:02:10.480> it'll<00:02:10.840> twist<00:02:11.080> out<00:02:11.290> of<00:02:11.410> the<00:02:11.470> way<00:02:11.790> you

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
manifold it'll twist out of the way you

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.520 
manifold it'll twist out of the way you
got<00:02:13.030> to<00:02:13.060> do<00:02:13.180> that<00:02:13.330> before<00:02:13.510> you<00:02:13.720> lift<00:02:13.990> it<00:02:14.140> up<00:02:14.230> I

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
got to do that before you lift it up I

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:15.480 
got to do that before you lift it up I
did<00:02:14.770> it<00:02:14.890> in<00:02:15.010> this<00:02:15.130> order

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
did it in this order

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.370 
did it in this order
so<00:02:15.700> it's<00:02:15.940> easier<00:02:16.240> to<00:02:16.420> see<00:02:16.630> what<00:02:16.810> I'm<00:02:16.960> talking

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
so it's easier to see what I'm talking

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.770 
so it's easier to see what I'm talking
about<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:18.550> next<00:02:18.820> thing<00:02:18.940> you<00:02:19.030> want<00:02:19.240> to<00:02:19.330> do<00:02:19.510> is

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
about the next thing you want to do is

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.630 
about the next thing you want to do is
you<00:02:20.380> just<00:02:20.410> go<00:02:20.650> through<00:02:20.770> and<00:02:21.100> pull<00:02:21.310> all<00:02:21.430> your

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
you just go through and pull all your

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.890 
you just go through and pull all your
ignition<00:02:21.880> coils<00:02:22.390> off<00:02:23.400> on<00:02:24.400> this<00:02:24.700> motor<00:02:25.060> just<00:02:25.690> by

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
ignition coils off on this motor just by

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.480 
ignition coils off on this motor just by
way<00:02:26.020> of<00:02:26.050> side<00:02:26.350> note<00:02:26.620> this<00:02:26.770> is<00:02:26.830> cylinder<00:02:27.310> number

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
way of side note this is cylinder number

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.520 
way of side note this is cylinder number
1<00:02:27.790> it's<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.150> cylinder<00:02:28.660> that's<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:29.020> closest

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
1 it's the cylinder that's the closest

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.900 
1 it's the cylinder that's the closest
to<00:02:29.740> the<00:02:29.860> timing<00:02:30.310> and<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:30.730> belts<00:02:31.030> and<00:02:31.440> so

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
to the timing and the belts and so

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.270 
to the timing and the belts and so
anyway<00:02:33.990> say<00:02:34.990> you<00:02:35.050> had<00:02:35.290> a<00:02:35.320> cylinder<00:02:35.650> misfire

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
anyway say you had a cylinder misfire

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.440 
anyway say you had a cylinder misfire
number<00:02:36.700> one<00:02:36.910> it<00:02:37.630> would<00:02:37.810> be<00:02:37.840> this<00:02:38.230> one<00:02:38.440> and<00:02:39.450> so

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
number one it would be this one and so

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.050 
number one it would be this one and so
on<00:02:40.480> anyway<00:02:41.380> I<00:02:41.590> hope<00:02:42.130> that's<00:02:42.430> helpful<00:02:42.730> to<00:02:43.030> you

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
on anyway I hope that's helpful to you

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.680 
on anyway I hope that's helpful to you
its<00:02:44.050> Torx<00:02:44.380> bits<00:02:44.680> here<00:02:45.100> I<00:02:45.310> think<00:02:45.970> that<00:02:46.240> looks

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
its Torx bits here I think that looks

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.670 
its Torx bits here I think that looks
like<00:02:46.780> a<00:02:46.840> t20<00:02:48.420> so<00:02:49.420> anyway<00:02:49.900> you<00:02:49.960> just<00:02:50.050> pull<00:02:50.410> a

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
like a t20 so anyway you just pull a

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.470 
like a t20 so anyway you just pull a
couple<00:02:51.010> of<00:02:51.100> screws<00:02:51.400> for<00:02:51.640> each<00:02:51.700> side<00:02:52.060> and<00:02:52.390> then

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
couple of screws for each side and then

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.540 
couple of screws for each side and then
those<00:02:52.660> ignition<00:02:53.140> coils<00:02:53.500> pop<00:02:53.770> right<00:02:54.070> up<00:02:54.280> and

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
those ignition coils pop right up and

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.360 
those ignition coils pop right up and
then<00:02:54.850> you<00:02:55.090> got<00:02:55.300> to<00:02:55.420> use<00:02:55.540> a<00:02:55.570> socket<00:02:56.050> extension

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
then you got to use a socket extension

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.840 
then you got to use a socket extension
and<00:02:58.260> suck<00:02:59.260> it<00:02:59.470> and<00:03:00.070> what<00:03:00.280> I<00:03:00.310> like<00:03:00.550> to<00:03:00.730> do

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
and suck it and what I like to do

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.580 
and suck it and what I like to do
because<00:03:01.210> everything<00:03:01.630> is<00:03:01.720> aluminum<00:03:02.200> nowadays

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
because everything is aluminum nowadays

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.170 
because everything is aluminum nowadays
I<00:03:02.860> like<00:03:03.190> to<00:03:03.340> use<00:03:03.430> a<00:03:03.460> little<00:03:03.760> bit<00:03:03.850> of<00:03:03.970> anti-seize

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
I like to use a little bit of anti-seize

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.970 
I like to use a little bit of anti-seize
you<00:03:04.690> can<00:03:04.840> see<00:03:04.990> I've<00:03:05.110> staged<00:03:05.380> all<00:03:05.620> the<00:03:05.740> new

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
you can see I've staged all the new

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:06.810 
you can see I've staged all the new
spark<00:03:06.310> plugs

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
spark plugs

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.180 
spark plugs
I<00:03:06.940> like<00:03:07.480> the<00:03:07.690> auto<00:03:07.930> light<00:03:08.260> Platinum's<00:03:08.950> they

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
I like the auto light Platinum's they

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.300 
I like the auto light Platinum's they
work<00:03:09.370> really<00:03:09.610> well<00:03:09.910> in<00:03:10.210> the<00:03:10.360> Chrysler<00:03:10.750> product

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
work really well in the Chrysler product

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.130 
work really well in the Chrysler product
so<00:03:12.310> what<00:03:12.700> i<00:03:12.730> do<00:03:12.850> is<00:03:13.270> i<00:03:13.450> go<00:03:13.570> through<00:03:13.720> lay<00:03:13.960> out<00:03:14.110> all

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
so what i do is i go through lay out all

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.710 
so what i do is i go through lay out all
the<00:03:14.290> plugs<00:03:14.650> and<00:03:14.920> then<00:03:15.520> i'll<00:03:16.030> put<00:03:16.270> a<00:03:16.300> little<00:03:16.540> bit

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
the plugs and then i'll put a little bit

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.170 
the plugs and then i'll put a little bit
of<00:03:16.930> anti-seize<00:03:17.860> on<00:03:18.460> each<00:03:18.610> of<00:03:18.790> them<00:03:18.910> with<00:03:19.060> the

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
of anti-seize on each of them with the

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.150 
of anti-seize on each of them with the
threads<00:03:19.480> just<00:03:19.720> a<00:03:19.810> little<00:03:20.110> dab<00:03:20.290> along<00:03:20.680> each<00:03:20.890> of

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
threads just a little dab along each of

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.980 
threads just a little dab along each of
them<00:03:21.280> and<00:03:22.180> that<00:03:22.330> will<00:03:22.450> ensure<00:03:22.600> that<00:03:22.750> they

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
them and that will ensure that they

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.290 
them and that will ensure that they
don't<00:03:23.080> get<00:03:23.320> stuck<00:03:23.590> it<00:03:23.770> in<00:03:23.890> there<00:03:24.040> and<00:03:24.370> corrode

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
don't get stuck it in there and corrode

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.060 
don't get stuck it in there and corrode
in<00:03:25.480> and<00:03:25.690> ruin<00:03:25.960> the<00:03:26.050> head<00:03:26.230> later<00:03:26.500> when<00:03:26.740> somebody

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
in and ruin the head later when somebody

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.260 
in and ruin the head later when somebody
tries<00:03:27.250> to<00:03:27.280> pull<00:03:27.550> them<00:03:27.670> out<00:03:27.760> but<00:03:28.000> they're<00:03:28.150> too

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
tries to pull them out but they're too

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.540 
tries to pull them out but they're too

there's<00:03:43.120> one<00:03:43.270> thing<00:03:43.450> I<00:03:43.540> want<00:03:43.720> to<00:03:43.780> add<00:03:43.960> and<00:03:44.260> tag

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
there's one thing I want to add and tag

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.720 
there's one thing I want to add and tag
on<00:03:44.680> this<00:03:44.880> is<00:03:45.880> that<00:03:46.180> these<00:03:47.020> gravity<00:03:47.740> get<00:03:47.950> I

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
on this is that these gravity get I

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.480 
on this is that these gravity get I
can't<00:03:49.270> even<00:03:49.360> talk<00:03:49.600> now<00:03:49.840> basically<00:03:50.800> it's<00:03:51.340> got

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.490 
can't even talk now basically it's got

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.460 
can't even talk now basically it's got
these<00:03:51.670> little<00:03:51.840> grommets<00:03:52.840> on<00:03:52.990> there<00:03:53.170> and<00:03:53.290> most

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
these little grommets on there and most

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.680 
these little grommets on there and most
of<00:03:53.680> them<00:03:53.800> stay<00:03:54.100> stuck<00:03:54.490> up<00:03:54.670> at<00:03:54.820> the<00:03:54.940> top<00:03:55.180> so<00:03:55.540> when

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
of them stay stuck up at the top so when

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.990 
of them stay stuck up at the top so when
you<00:03:55.780> go<00:03:55.900> to<00:03:55.960> pull<00:03:56.200> it<00:03:56.380> out<00:03:56.940> instead<00:03:57.940> of

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
you go to pull it out instead of

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.840 
you go to pull it out instead of
Threatened<00:03:58.480> out<00:03:58.690> they<00:03:59.380> stick<00:03:59.800> so<00:04:00.490> what<00:04:00.730> you

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
Threatened out they stick so what you

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.090 
Threatened out they stick so what you
want<00:04:01.000> to<00:04:01.090> be<00:04:01.180> mindful<00:04:01.420> of<00:04:01.750> if<00:04:02.200> you<00:04:02.440> zip<00:04:02.710> one<00:04:02.920> of

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
want to be mindful of if you zip one of

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.430 
want to be mindful of if you zip one of
them<00:04:03.220> all<00:04:03.370> the<00:04:03.490> way<00:04:03.610> out<00:04:03.640> it<00:04:04.060> can<00:04:04.270> create<00:04:04.600> cause

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
them all the way out it can create cause

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.860 
them all the way out it can create cause
this<00:04:05.710> to<00:04:05.830> go<00:04:05.980> sideways<00:04:06.280> and<00:04:07.180> potentially

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
this to go sideways and potentially

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.900 
this to go sideways and potentially
damage<00:04:08.320> the<00:04:08.350> ignition<00:04:09.040> coil<00:04:09.310> maybe<00:04:09.640> cause<00:04:09.880> a

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
damage the ignition coil maybe cause a

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.550 
damage the ignition coil maybe cause a
fracture<00:04:10.300> or<00:04:10.600> something<00:04:10.840> that<00:04:11.200> will<00:04:11.320> cause

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
fracture or something that will cause

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.310 
fracture or something that will cause
that<00:04:11.800> arc<00:04:12.070> later<00:04:12.580> so<00:04:13.360> what<00:04:13.720> you<00:04:13.870> want<00:04:14.080> to<00:04:14.200> do

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
that arc later so what you want to do

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.870 
that arc later so what you want to do
this<00:04:14.920> is<00:04:15.040> a<00:04:15.100> part<00:04:15.340> where<00:04:15.459> you<00:04:15.520> can<00:04:15.670> pay

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
this is a part where you can pay

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.510 
this is a part where you can pay
attention<00:04:16.799> the<00:04:17.799> other<00:04:17.920> part<00:04:18.190> you<00:04:18.220> can<00:04:18.370> pretty

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:18.520 
attention the other part you can pretty

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.310 
attention the other part you can pretty
much<00:04:18.609> be<00:04:18.850> sleeping<00:04:19.209> but<00:04:19.359> pull<00:04:19.540> one<00:04:19.780> go<00:04:20.140> back

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
much be sleeping but pull one go back

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.020 
much be sleeping but pull one go back
and<00:04:20.560> forth<00:04:20.799> as<00:04:21.040> you<00:04:21.160> do<00:04:21.370> them<00:04:21.640> so<00:04:21.760> that<00:04:21.910> they

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
and forth as you do them so that they

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.690 
and forth as you do them so that they
come<00:04:22.210> up<00:04:22.390> evenly<00:04:22.840> and<00:04:23.200> if<00:04:24.070> you<00:04:24.190> do<00:04:24.340> that<00:04:24.520> you

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
come up evenly and if you do that you

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.030 
come up evenly and if you do that you
won't<00:04:24.820> have<00:04:25.060> any<00:04:25.240> issue<00:04:25.510> with<00:04:25.840> them<00:04:26.169> being<00:04:26.950> a

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
won't have any issue with them being a

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.650 
won't have any issue with them being a
problem<00:04:27.430> later<00:04:27.669> especially<00:04:27.940> on<00:04:28.300> these<00:04:28.450> ones

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
problem later especially on these ones

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:29.100 
problem later especially on these ones
that<00:04:28.780> are<00:04:28.870> on

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
that are on

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.070 
that are on
the<00:04:29.200> manifold<00:04:29.740> on<00:04:29.980> the<00:04:30.430> backside<00:04:31.000> maybe<00:04:31.870> you

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
the manifold on the backside maybe you

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.900 
the manifold on the backside maybe you
could<00:04:32.260> spot<00:04:32.560> a<00:04:32.590> problem<00:04:33.220> because<00:04:33.580> you<00:04:33.790> can

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
could spot a problem because you can

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.340 
could spot a problem because you can
look<00:04:34.060> over<00:04:34.210> the<00:04:34.360> top<00:04:34.630> and<00:04:34.930> see<00:04:35.080> if<00:04:35.170> it<00:04:35.290> was

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
look over the top and see if it was

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.040 
look over the top and see if it was
arcing<00:04:35.830> but<00:04:36.430> on<00:04:36.670> the<00:04:36.880> one<00:04:37.030> under<00:04:37.360> the<00:04:37.480> manifold

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
arcing but on the one under the manifold

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.260 
arcing but on the one under the manifold
you<00:04:38.110> just<00:04:38.410> be<00:04:38.560> blind<00:04:38.920> you'd<00:04:39.700> have<00:04:39.850> to<00:04:39.970> pull<00:04:40.150> the

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
you just be blind you'd have to pull the

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.750 
you just be blind you'd have to pull the
manifold<00:04:40.780> and<00:04:40.870> just<00:04:41.110> guess<00:04:41.320> at<00:04:41.590> it<00:04:41.770> so<00:04:42.040> pull

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
manifold and just guess at it so pull

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.120 
manifold and just guess at it so pull
them<00:04:42.850> up<00:04:43.030> you<00:04:43.390> know<00:04:43.450> go<00:04:43.780> back<00:04:43.990> and<00:04:44.200> forth<00:04:44.470> and

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
them up you know go back and forth and

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.180 
them up you know go back and forth and
you<00:04:45.310> should<00:04:45.460> have<00:04:45.550> good<00:04:45.730> success
