00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
through my sneakers so it's probably the

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.180 
through my sneakers so it's probably the
stop<00:02:23.150> store<00:02:23.570> to<00:02:23.690> through<00:02:23.900> there<00:02:24.110> but<00:02:24.740> this<00:02:25.010> is

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
stop store to through there but this is

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.670 
down just a little bit and this is still
my<00:02:30.080> boys<00:02:30.320> talking<00:02:30.770> and<00:02:31.990> I'll<00:02:32.990> go<00:02:33.290> ahead<00:02:33.530> and

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
so that way you can see and I'm not

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.920

adjusting<00:02:46.550> any<00:02:46.820> of<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.240> settings<00:02:48.230> right<00:02:48.590> now

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
adjusting any of the settings right now

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
and this is this is what it sounds like

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.830
