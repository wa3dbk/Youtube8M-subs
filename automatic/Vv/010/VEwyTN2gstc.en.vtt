00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.560
 juan carlos manager of removals 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.680
 source is a company from madrid that we 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.059
 We dedicated to international fashions 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.800
 changes of the source we have 18 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.710
 vehicles and recently we have 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.850
 acquired the tachograph to vd or 2.0 from 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.960
 Then our drivers are more 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.940
 happy and we save time and money 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.640
 six months ago then practically 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.980
 worry is heart 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.260
 for me the main novelty is not having 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.730
 than download tachographs and 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.739
 drivers cards 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.160
 here you can upload them in germany or 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.160
 Switzerland 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.610
 where is that undo the remote by the 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:48.850
 computer we make a virtual call 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.050
 phone to the truck are downloaded with 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.000
 the data that both the tachograph has 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.000
 cards and drivers 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.579
 drivers this heart has like 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.739
 main benefits is very intuitive 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.330
 to know the times at all times 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.670
 that you lack to complete a stage of 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.049
 I rest a driving stage and with 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.330
 this avoid infractions that before 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:11.740
 committed because of ignorance of these 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.810
 times because now I know what 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.119
 what happens in trucks and those that 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.479
 do the drivers with the report of 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.479
 web pis 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.580
 the idea of ​​the future is that all our 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.520
 fleets have the digital caps noise 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.960
 2.0 well to make more profitable and to 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.990
 have more control over all the data 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.610
 of company above all brings three things 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.890
 new and on the one hand manage the data 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.380
 on the other hand history the data during 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.179
 a year that is what the law asks of me and 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.649
 on the other hand when I have to bring the 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:42.670
 trucks from here the drivers every 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:44.229
 time I have to make a download of 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.619
 can do it between motorcycles that saves us 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.619
 time and 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.219
 I'm going to use finished over there now I'm going to 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.219
 relax a little 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.650
 Thanks to the digital tachograph I can 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.150
 dedicate more time to my family to the 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.150
