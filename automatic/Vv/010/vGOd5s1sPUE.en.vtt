what<00:00:00.659> is<00:00:00.780> up<00:00:00.930> everybody<00:00:01.530> this<00:00:01.860> is<00:00:01.979> a<00:00:02.129> table<00:00:02.580> and

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
what is up everybody this is a table and

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.789 
what is up everybody this is a table and
in<00:00:02.909> this<00:00:03.060> video<00:00:03.270> I'm<00:00:03.629> going<00:00:04.140> to<00:00:04.259> be<00:00:04.319> naming<00:00:04.560> my

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
in this video I'm going to be naming my

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.120 
in this video I'm going to be naming my
top<00:00:05.130> five<00:00:05.430> unique<00:00:05.940> mechanics<00:00:06.690> in<00:00:06.899> zombies<00:00:07.529> now

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
top five unique mechanics in zombies now

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.129 
top five unique mechanics in zombies now
what<00:00:08.309> I<00:00:08.340> mean<00:00:08.610> by<00:00:08.790> a<00:00:08.820> unique<00:00:09.300> is<00:00:09.540> that<00:00:09.599> this

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
what I mean by a unique is that this

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.320 
what I mean by a unique is that this
mechanic<00:00:10.620> cannot<00:00:10.980> be<00:00:11.190> in<00:00:11.400> more<00:00:11.670> than<00:00:11.700> one<00:00:11.910> map

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
mechanic cannot be in more than one map

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.539 
mechanic cannot be in more than one map
so<00:00:12.960> for<00:00:13.170> instance<00:00:13.500> pack-a-punch<00:00:13.950> doesn't

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
so for instance pack-a-punch doesn't

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.609 
so for instance pack-a-punch doesn't
count<00:00:14.790> because<00:00:15.089> it's<00:00:15.570> in<00:00:15.839> more<00:00:16.080> than<00:00:16.199> one<00:00:16.379> map

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
count because it's in more than one map

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.950 
count because it's in more than one map
starting<00:00:17.250> off<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.520> list<00:00:17.699> at<00:00:17.850> number<00:00:17.910> five<00:00:18.330> we

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
starting off the list at number five we

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.470 
starting off the list at number five we
have<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.289> lunar<00:00:19.650> landers<00:00:20.130> on<00:00:20.369> ascension<00:00:21.090> now

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
have the lunar landers on ascension now

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.660 
have the lunar landers on ascension now
I've<00:00:21.689> stated<00:00:22.109> in<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.560> past<00:00:22.859> that<00:00:23.279> lunar

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
I've stated in the past that lunar

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.849 
I've stated in the past that lunar
landers<00:00:24.029> are<00:00:24.240> nothing<00:00:24.660> more<00:00:24.869> than<00:00:24.930> reskin<00:00:25.680> two

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
landers are nothing more than reskin two

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.519 
landers are nothing more than reskin two
teleporters<00:00:26.609> however<00:00:27.359> they<00:00:27.750> do<00:00:27.810> technically

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
teleporters however they do technically

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.650 
teleporters however they do technically
fit<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.010> bill<00:00:29.220> for<00:00:29.550> this<00:00:29.670> list<00:00:30.000> so<00:00:30.269> I'm<00:00:30.390> going

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
fit the bill for this list so I'm going

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.380 
fit the bill for this list so I'm going
to<00:00:30.689> throw<00:00:30.960> them<00:00:31.109> on<00:00:31.349> there<00:00:31.700> when<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:32.850> activate

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
to throw them on there when you activate

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.479 
to throw them on there when you activate
the<00:00:33.510> lunar<00:00:33.809> landers<00:00:34.260> you're<00:00:34.680> safe<00:00:35.040> for<00:00:35.460> a

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
the lunar landers you're safe for a

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.549 
the lunar landers you're safe for a
certain<00:00:35.850> amount<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:36.180> time<00:00:36.420> from<00:00:36.690> any<00:00:36.989> zombies

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559

how great these elevators are I want to

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.020 
how great these elevators are I want to
specify<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:45.810> on<00:01:46.200> die<00:01:46.500> rise<00:01:46.799> those<00:01:47.369> elevators

specify that on die rise those elevators

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.120 
specify that on die rise those elevators
are<00:01:48.240> not<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.869> same<00:01:49.049> they<00:01:49.320> work<00:01:49.530> completely

elevators<00:01:54.899> just<00:01:54.930> seem<00:01:55.439> like<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.680> hassle<00:01:56.009> you

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
elevators just seem like a hassle you

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.420 
elevators just seem like a hassle you
have<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.880> spend<00:01:57.149> 250<00:01:58.049> points<00:01:58.680> just<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.100> move<00:01:59.219> on

to the next room and back however as you

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.940 
to the next room and back however as you
play<00:02:02.759> on<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.719> may<00:02:03.960> notice<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.409> the

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
play on you may notice that the

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.429 
play on you may notice that the
elevators<00:02:05.670> actually<00:02:06.180> provide<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.780> safe<00:02:07.170> and

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
elevators actually provide a safe and

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.740 
elevators actually provide a safe and
reliable<00:02:07.619> form<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.489> transportation<00:02:08.940> at<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.509> low

reliable form of transportation at a low
cost

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
cost

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.750 
cost
much<00:02:10.770> like<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.129> lunar<00:02:11.459> land

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
much like the lunar land

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.570 
much like the lunar land
and<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.360> teleporters<00:02:13.049> now<00:02:13.590> this<00:02:13.830> alone<00:02:14.250> would

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
and the teleporters now this alone would

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.210 
and the teleporters now this alone would
not<00:02:14.790> be<00:02:15.060> enough<00:02:15.390> to<00:02:15.599> get<00:02:15.750> it<00:02:15.840> on<00:02:16.019> this<00:02:16.200> list<00:02:16.560> the

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
not be enough to get it on this list the

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.369 
not be enough to get it on this list the
reason<00:02:17.610> it's<00:02:17.760> here<00:02:17.970> is<00:02:18.030> mainly<00:02:18.480> because<00:02:18.840> it

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
reason it's here is mainly because it

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.440 
reason it's here is mainly because it
opens<00:02:19.799> up<00:02:19.920> a<00:02:20.099> lot<00:02:20.459> of<00:02:20.700> new<00:02:21.060> strategies

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
opens up a lot of new strategies

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.860 
opens up a lot of new strategies

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659 
fact the main strategy for co-op on this

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:29.899 
fact the main strategy for co-op on this
map<00:02:27.840> has<00:02:28.079> become<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.799> camp<00:02:29.040> in<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.250> elevators

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909

Treyarch first introduced this

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.929 
Treyarch first introduced this
invaluable<00:02:39.720> piece<00:02:40.379> of<00:02:40.440> equipment<00:02:41.220> people
