close to your kit how do you do it well

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:51.649 
close to your kit how do you do it well
one<00:00:48.600> option<00:00:48.780> would<00:00:49.049> be<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.260> call<00:00:49.620> me<00:00:50.479> but<00:00:51.479> I

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:51.659 
one option would be to call me but I

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:53.030 
one option would be to call me but I
don't<00:00:52.019> really<00:00:52.170> have<00:00:52.290> the<00:00:52.409> plan<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.949> would

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
don't really have the plan that would

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.820 
don't really have the plan that would
cover<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.729> so<00:00:54.390> that's<00:00:54.809> completely<00:00:55.350> out<00:00:55.680> the

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:55.830 
cover that so that's completely out the

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.950 
cover that so that's completely out the
window<00:00:56.100> so<00:00:57.000> I'm<00:00:57.089> going<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.239> show<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.540> how<00:00:57.900> you

window so I'm going to show you how you
can<00:00:58.199> do<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:59.040> know<00:00:59.159> one<00:01:00.030> way<00:01:00.210> would<00:01:00.479> be<00:01:00.540> to

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:00.659 
can do it you know one way would be to

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:02.930 
can do it you know one way would be to
mount<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.619> know<00:01:01.710> two<00:01:01.769> boom<00:01:02.220> arms<00:01:02.489> coming<00:01:02.790> off

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
mount you know two boom arms coming off

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.630 
mount you know two boom arms coming off
of<00:01:03.000> your<00:01:03.750> cymbal<00:01:04.080> stand<00:01:04.320> but<00:01:05.010> maybe<00:01:05.190> you<00:01:05.400> want

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
of your cymbal stand but maybe you want

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.000 
of your cymbal stand but maybe you want
something<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.970> little<00:01:06.000> more<00:01:06.240> compact<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.590> SC

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
something a little more compact the SC

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.210 
something a little more compact the SC
4425<00:01:08.970> STM<00:01:09.630> B<00:01:09.930> which<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.650> splash<00:01:10.979> three

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
4425 STM B which is the splash three

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.820 
4425 STM B which is the splash three
boom<00:01:11.430> arm<00:01:11.640> will<00:01:12.090> do<00:01:12.210> just<00:01:12.479> that

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
boom arm will do just that

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.080 
boom arm will do just that
okay<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:13.890> now<00:01:14.100> let's<00:01:14.250> see<00:01:14.340> what<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:14.549> consists

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
okay so now let's see what this consists

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.630 
okay so now let's see what this consists
of<00:01:15.210> we've<00:01:15.900> got<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:16.050> mini<00:01:16.290> boom<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:17.070> cymbal<00:01:17.460> L

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
of we've got a mini boom and a cymbal L

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.150 
of we've got a mini boom and a cymbal L
arm<00:01:17.940> attachment<00:01:18.690> now<00:01:19.200> these<00:01:19.410> both<00:01:19.740> work

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
arm attachment now these both work

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.360 
arm attachment now these both work
together<00:01:20.370> in<00:01:20.760> conjunction<00:01:21.860> it's<00:01:22.860> big<00:01:23.010> word<00:01:23.190> I

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.370 
together in conjunction it's big word I

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.120 
together in conjunction it's big word I
know<00:01:23.460> but<00:01:24.090> we're<00:01:24.510> surmounting<00:01:25.290> two<00:01:25.650> symbols

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
know but we're surmounting two symbols

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.090 
know but we're surmounting two symbols
onto<00:01:26.400> one<00:01:27.120> boom<00:01:27.450> arm<00:01:27.720> mounting<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.830> one

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
onto one boom arm mounting it to one

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.640 
onto one boom arm mounting it to one
stand<00:01:29.520> using<00:01:30.090> one<00:01:30.360> clamp<00:01:30.690> there's<00:01:31.050> a<00:01:31.140> lot<00:01:31.470> of

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
stand using one clamp there's a lot of

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.550 
stand using one clamp there's a lot of
ones<00:01:31.860> going<00:01:32.100> on<00:01:32.340> here<00:01:32.550> and<00:01:32.640> only<00:01:32.730> one<00:01:33.360> two<00:01:33.720> now

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
ones going on here and only one two now

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.650 
ones going on here and only one two now
the<00:01:34.620> main<00:01:34.890> splash<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.580> mounted<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.120> the<00:01:36.510> mini

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:36.660 
the main splash is mounted to the mini

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.750 
the main splash is mounted to the mini
boom<00:01:36.870> and<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.140> can<00:01:37.830> adjust<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.340> angle<00:01:38.370> of<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
boom and you can adjust the angle of the

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.210 
boom and you can adjust the angle of the
splash<00:01:39.030> in<00:01:39.390> two<00:01:39.960> ways<00:01:40.170> at<00:01:40.440> the<00:01:40.800> angle

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
splash in two ways at the angle

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.770 
splash in two ways at the angle
adjustment<00:01:41.640> tilter<00:01:41.909> right<00:01:42.360> here<00:01:42.540> where<00:01:42.690> the

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
adjustment tilter right here where the

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.080 
adjustment tilter right here where the
boom<00:01:42.960> attaches<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.190> actual<00:01:44.460> down<00:01:44.640> stem<00:01:44.940> of

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
boom attaches to the actual down stem of

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.580 
boom attaches to the actual down stem of
the<00:01:45.210> of<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.540> arm<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:46.650> the<00:01:47.310> cymbal<00:01:47.640> tilter

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
the of the arm and of the cymbal tilter

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.320 
the of the arm and of the cymbal tilter
now<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.650> secondary<00:01:50.159> splash<00:01:50.580> is<00:01:50.820> mounted<00:01:51.120> to

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
now the secondary splash is mounted to

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.680 
now the secondary splash is mounted to
the<00:01:51.510> boom<00:01:51.690> arm<00:01:51.980> with<00:01:52.980> a<00:01:53.220> boom<00:01:53.850> rod<00:01:54.060> clamp<00:01:54.510> that

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
the boom arm with a boom rod clamp that

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.960 
the boom arm with a boom rod clamp that
has<00:01:54.930> two<00:01:55.350> angle<00:01:55.830> adjustment<00:01:56.250> assemblies<00:01:56.640> so

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
has two angle adjustment assemblies so

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.760 
has two angle adjustment assemblies so
