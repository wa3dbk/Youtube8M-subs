00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 Share silence in words 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 Progress 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.430
 No one teaches you about hatred 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 These are the ways 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 Which have been desecrated therein 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 Your credibility 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 About Love. 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.980
 Your question is, I said that love and hate 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 The same energy; 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.301
 So why is there so much hatred in the world? 

00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:04.750
 Not much love? 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.497
 It is because no one has taught you about hatred; 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.021
 Thus, hatred has remained pure, 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.150
 Clear. 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.982
 No one has bothered himself around you, no one has told you how you hate, 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.822
 Who hates. 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.750
 Because hate has been kept intangible by your parents, 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.508
 Professors, priests, 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.899
 It has purity, 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.390
 sincerity. 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.800
 When a man hates you, 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.245
 You can trust that he hates you. But when he loves you, 

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:13.300
 You can not trust him. 

00:02:15.883 --> 00:02:22.580
 You fully know that when you hate someone 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.425
 It has tremendous power, 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.623
 And when you love someone 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.450
 There is no such force. 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.690
 You remember your enemies more than your friends. 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.383
 You can forget your friends 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.680
 But you can not forget your enemies. 

00:03:02.346 --> 00:03:06.387
 what's going? 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.374
 That is because your love has been deformed, 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.665
 Something is not real, 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.900
 Which is not love, 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.780
 May put in your hands. 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.750
 You may have been playing that game 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.322
 Named Love, 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.900
 Unconsciously you have 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.050
 The ability of love within you. 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.450
 So when you love 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.244
 It is just so - so, 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.972
 Deeply skin. 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.850
 A little itch and it disappears. 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.988
 But when you hate, 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.796
 You hate your bones. 

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:18.430
 It's not deeply skin 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.650
 It's the depth of the bowels. 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.740
 I have been surprised 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.950
 How much purity of hatred, 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.700
 How many real, natural, spontaneous. 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.502
 And only because of its spontaneity, nature, 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:03.090
 Its truth, its purity, I see in it a certain aesthetic that does not exist in your love.
