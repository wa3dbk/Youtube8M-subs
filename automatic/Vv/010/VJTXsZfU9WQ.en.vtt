guys<00:00:30.599> just<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.929> little<00:00:30.960> example<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.619> how<00:00:31.800> it

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
guys just a little example of how it

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.920 
guys just a little example of how it
works<00:00:31.980> I'm<00:00:32.610> going<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.820> hip-hop<00:00:33.090> sort<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.690> feel

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
works I'm going to hip-hop sort of feel

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.450 
works I'm going to hip-hop sort of feel
because<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:34.320> can<00:00:34.440> sound<00:00:34.620> really<00:00:34.739> really<00:00:35.250> cool

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
because it can sound really really cool

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.389 
because it can sound really really cool
so<00:00:36.149> there's<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.630> three<00:00:36.840> against<00:00:37.110> two<00:00:37.200> thing<00:00:37.710> I'm

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
so there's a three against two thing I'm

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.560 
so there's a three against two thing I'm
going<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.610> borrow<00:00:38.790> our<00:00:38.850> page<00:00:39.090> from<00:00:39.329> Steve

guys<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.309> my<00:00:41.430> hands<00:00:41.910> on<00:00:42.210> my<00:00:42.270> leg<00:00:42.600> it's<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.170> little

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
guys to my hands on my leg it's a little

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.889 
guys to my hands on my leg it's a little
easier<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:44.730> want<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.030> count<00:00:45.210> it's<00:00:45.570> basically

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
easier you want to count it's basically

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.380 
easier you want to count it's basically
you're<00:00:46.110> counting<00:00:46.590> two<00:00:46.920> rhythms<00:00:47.160> with<00:00:48.059> sort<00:00:48.329> of

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
you're counting two rhythms with sort of

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.540 
you're counting two rhythms with sort of
one<00:00:48.629> side<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:49.050> your<00:00:49.170> body<00:00:49.320> or<00:00:49.829> with<00:00:50.010> one<00:00:50.219> hand

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
one side of your body or with one hand

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.799 
one side of your body or with one hand
if<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.850> think<00:00:50.879> about<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.360> like<00:00:51.449> that

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
if you think about it like that

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.110 
if you think about it like that
and<00:00:51.899> three<00:00:52.620> with<00:00:53.219> another<00:00:53.520> side<00:00:53.820> and

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
and three with another side and

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.180 
and three with another side and
sometimes<00:00:54.930> it's<00:00:55.140> easier<00:00:55.440> it's<00:00:55.620> easier<00:00:55.649> for<00:00:55.890> me

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
sometimes it's easier it's easier for me

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.549 
sometimes it's easier it's easier for me
to<00:00:56.219> think<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.699> as<00:00:56.850> instead<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.660> three<00:00:57.840> over<00:00:57.989> two

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
to think it as instead of three over two

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.010 
to think it as instead of three over two
like<00:00:58.890> six<00:00:59.219> over<00:00:59.489> four<00:00:59.879> because<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.690> just<00:01:00.870> sort

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
like six over four because you just sort

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.139 
like six over four because you just sort
of<00:01:01.050> multiplying<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.770> by<00:01:01.800> 2<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.190> know<00:01:02.489> 3<00:01:02.789> over<00:01:02.969> 2

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
of multiplying it by 2 you know 3 over 2

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.170 
of multiplying it by 2 you know 3 over 2
6<00:01:03.899> over<00:01:04.170> 4<00:01:04.409> not<00:01:05.159> exactly<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.519> math<00:01:05.729> whiz<00:01:05.970> but<00:01:06.060> I

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
6 over 4 not exactly a math whiz but I

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.330 
6 over 4 not exactly a math whiz but I
think<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.630> works<00:01:06.810> oh<00:01:07.140> alright<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:07.950> with<00:01:08.130> one

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
think that works oh alright so with one

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.450 
think that works oh alright so with one
hand<00:01:08.610> you're<00:01:08.790> playing<00:01:09.000> for<00:01:09.330> right<00:01:09.659> like<00:01:09.869> 1<00:01:10.290> 2<00:01:10.860> 3

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
hand you're playing for right like 1 2 3

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.399 
hand you're playing for right like 1 2 3
4<00:01:12.090> 1<00:01:13.790> 4<00:01:14.790> that's<00:01:15.570> where<00:01:15.689> he<00:01:15.750> never<00:01:15.900> stops<00:01:16.170> there

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
4 1 4 that's where he never stops there

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.630 
4 1 4 that's where he never stops there
that's<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.950> know<00:01:17.040> let's<00:01:17.310> just<00:01:17.460> keep<00:01:17.580> going

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
that's you know let's just keep going

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.039 
that's you know let's just keep going
into<00:01:18.060> 1<00:01:18.270> 2<00:01:18.750> 3<00:01:19.350> 4<00:01:20.100> now<00:01:20.670> against<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.390> you're

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
into 1 2 3 4 now against that you're

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.460 
into 1 2 3 4 now against that you're
playing<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.710> 6<00:01:23.340> field<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.080> way<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.290> works

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
playing a 6 field so the way it works

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.630 
playing a 6 field so the way it works
out<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.189> it's<00:01:26.460> like<00:01:26.640> 1<00:01:27.000> 2<00:01:27.750> 3<00:01:28.439> 4<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.490> this

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
out is that it's like 1 2 3 4 of this

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.319 
out is that it's like 1 2 3 4 of this
really<00:01:29.970> really<00:01:30.150> slowly<00:01:30.500> three<00:01:31.500> four<00:01:32.310> one<00:01:33.060> two

one two six one two six you see the

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.109 
one two six one two six you see the
rhythms<00:01:46.979> kind<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.220> intersect<00:01:47.700> each<00:01:47.820> other

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
rhythms kind of intersect each other

00:01:48.119 --> 00:02:02.569 
rhythms kind of intersect each other
you<00:01:48.930> plant<00:01:49.200> together<00:01:49.380> like<00:01:58.009> 3<00:01:59.329> 1<00:02:00.329> 2<00:02:00.689> 3<00:02:01.049> 4<00:02:01.530> 5<00:02:01.920> 6<00:02:02.310> 1

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
you plant together like 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 1

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.910 
you plant together like 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 1
2<00:02:02.790> 3<00:02:03.090> 4<00:02:03.600> 5<00:02:04.290> 6

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
2 3 4 5 6

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.550 
2 3 4 5 6
let's<00:02:05.729> basically<00:02:06.149> have<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.329> 3<00:02:06.630> over<00:02:06.840> 2<00:02:07.020> or<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.350> 6

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
let's basically have a 3 over 2 or a 6

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.930 
let's basically have a 3 over 2 or a 6
over<00:02:07.740> 4<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.069> polyrhythm

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
over 4 a polyrhythm

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.660 
over 4 a polyrhythm
works<00:02:09.180> now<00:02:10.229> again<00:02:11.130> you<00:02:11.250> don't<00:02:11.340> have<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.580> go

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
works now again you don't have to go

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.940 
works now again you don't have to go
crazy<00:02:12.120> with<00:02:12.420> this<00:02:12.570> kind<00:02:12.840> of<00:02:12.900> stuff<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.650> involve

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
crazy with this kind of stuff to involve

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.520 
crazy with this kind of stuff to involve
it's<00:02:14.220> really<00:02:14.520> cool<00:02:14.760> musical<00:02:15.360> applications<00:02:16.110> so

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
it's really cool musical applications so

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.390 
it's really cool musical applications so
I'm<00:02:16.590> gonna<00:02:16.680> play<00:02:16.860> just<00:02:17.010> kind<00:02:17.220> of<00:02:17.250> like<00:02:17.370> a

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
I'm gonna play just kind of like a

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.870 
I'm gonna play just kind of like a
simple<00:02:17.940> medium<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:19.320> slow<00:02:19.500> tempo<00:02:20.040> hip-hop<00:02:20.580> beat

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
simple medium to slow tempo hip-hop beat

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.580 
simple medium to slow tempo hip-hop beat
and<00:02:21.390> I'll<00:02:21.510> sound<00:02:21.660> like<00:02:21.840> this<00:02:22.020> do<00:02:22.260> like<00:02:22.290> eight

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
and I'll sound like this do like eight

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:52.460 
and I'll sound like this do like eight
bars<00:02:49.370> all<00:02:50.370> right<00:02:50.490> so<00:02:50.810> a<00:02:51.810> person<00:02:52.260> might<00:02:52.350> have

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
bars all right so a person might have

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.250 
bars all right so a person might have
been<00:02:52.710> 16<00:02:53.190> again<00:02:54.030> my<00:02:54.180> math<00:02:54.390> is<00:02:54.420> not<00:02:54.600> exactly<00:02:55.080> the

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
been 16 again my math is not exactly the

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.770 
been 16 again my math is not exactly the
best<00:02:55.290> but<00:02:55.740> it<00:02:56.670> comes<00:02:56.850> down<00:02:56.970> that<00:02:57.390> I<00:02:57.450> mean<00:02:57.750> I

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
best but it comes down that I mean I

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:58.970 
best but it comes down that I mean I
know<00:02:57.930> that<00:02:57.960> sounds<00:02:58.320> pretty<00:02:58.440> good<00:02:58.680> you<00:02:58.830> can

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
know that sounds pretty good you can

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.470 
know that sounds pretty good you can
throw<00:02:59.130> some<00:02:59.190> fills<00:02:59.580> in<00:02:59.760> and<00:02:59.850> stuff<00:03:00.060> like<00:03:00.270> that

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
throw some fills in and stuff like that

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.840 
throw some fills in and stuff like that
if<00:03:00.960> you<00:03:01.110> had<00:03:01.200> a<00:03:01.260> poly<00:03:01.590> rhythm<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.220> it<00:03:02.250> gives<00:03:02.790> you

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
if you had a poly rhythm to it gives you

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.120 
if you had a poly rhythm to it gives you
this<00:03:02.940> really<00:03:03.180> like<00:03:03.450> slowing<00:03:04.320> down<00:03:04.530> kind<00:03:05.070> of

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
this really like slowing down kind of

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.160 
this really like slowing down kind of
like<00:03:05.280> fighting<00:03:05.850> against<00:03:06.390> the<00:03:06.480> beat<00:03:06.750> kind<00:03:06.990> of

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
like fighting against the beat kind of

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.870 
like fighting against the beat kind of
thing<00:03:07.410> and<00:03:08.070> like<00:03:08.190> I<00:03:08.250> said<00:03:08.340> you<00:03:08.460> want<00:03:08.730> to<00:03:08.760> use

my left hand is going to be playing the

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.600 
my left hand is going to be playing the
six<00:03:24.450> polylearn<00:03:24.959> against<00:03:25.560> it<00:03:25.709> so<00:03:26.130> sorry<00:03:26.370> right

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610

here<00:03:26.820> kinda<00:03:27.120> it<00:03:27.300> looks<00:03:27.510> like<00:03:27.770> so<00:03:28.770> what<00:03:29.010> does<00:03:29.100> it

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
here kinda it looks like so what does it

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:47.750 
here kinda it looks like so what does it
sound<00:03:29.400> like<00:03:29.550> on<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:29.880> kit<00:03:30.150> so<00:03:30.810> it's<00:03:30.959> like

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.950 

and<00:03:48.760> I<00:03:48.850> think<00:03:48.970> to<00:03:49.120> remember<00:03:49.450> with<00:03:49.600> this<00:03:49.750> is

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:49.960 
and I think to remember with this is

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.620 
and I think to remember with this is
that<00:03:50.080> the<00:03:50.230> beach<00:03:50.950> always<00:03:51.250> start<00:03:51.670> together<00:03:52.090> so

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
that the beach always start together so

00:03:52.630 --> 00:04:03.240 
that the beach always start together so
he's<00:03:52.810> like<00:04:00.630> so<00:04:01.630> they<00:04:01.720> always<00:04:01.960> resolved<00:04:02.650> on<00:04:02.770> the

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
he's like so they always resolved on the

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.190 
he's like so they always resolved on the
one<00:04:03.520> so<00:04:03.970> you<00:04:04.060> always<00:04:04.210> want<00:04:04.420> to<00:04:04.450> start<00:04:04.750> the

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
one so you always want to start the

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:05.990 
one so you always want to start the
hands<00:04:05.380> together

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
hands together

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.580 
hands together
that's<00:04:07.000> a<00:04:07.120> big<00:04:07.300> thing<00:04:07.330> that<00:04:07.570> helped<00:04:07.930> me<00:04:07.990> but

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
that's a big thing that helped me but

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.960 
that's a big thing that helped me but
I'm<00:04:08.680> sure<00:04:08.860> you<00:04:08.980> sort<00:04:09.190> of<00:04:09.250> how<00:04:09.430> this<00:04:09.670> can<00:04:09.820> be

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
I'm sure you sort of how this can be

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.490 
I'm sure you sort of how this can be
used<00:04:10.150> in<00:04:10.270> a<00:04:10.330> living<00:04:10.600> musical<00:04:11.080> way<00:04:11.200> with<00:04:11.410> the

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
used in a living musical way with the

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:45.399 
used in a living musical way with the
hip-hop<00:04:11.680> group

00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:45.409 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:47.659 

and<00:04:46.409> there<00:04:46.560> you<00:04:46.650> go<00:04:46.800> it's<00:04:47.159> where<00:04:47.340> you<00:04:47.400> can<00:04:47.520> use

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
and there you go it's where you can use

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:50.420 
and there you go it's where you can use
polyrhythms<00:04:48.180> in<00:04:48.569> a<00:04:48.659> hip-hop<00:04:48.870> context<00:04:49.710> make<00:04:50.310> it

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
polyrhythms in a hip-hop context make it

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.309 
polyrhythms in a hip-hop context make it
sound<00:04:50.550> really<00:04:50.789> really<00:04:51.090> cool<00:04:51.270> thanks<00:04:52.229> for

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:52.319 
sound really really cool thanks for

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:55.669 
sound really really cool thanks for
stopping<00:04:52.620> by<00:04:52.650> seeing<00:04:53.340> this<00:04:53.460> that
