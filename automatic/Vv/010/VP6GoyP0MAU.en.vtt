00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.710
 it's a very basic game and it 's pretty 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.060
 great is currently thanks on the play 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.830

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.910
 then we have here in the part of the 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.119
 adjustments because we want to be 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.980
 Audio camera accessibility language 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.539
 etcetera here we have a button on the 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.220
 camera to give them tell what it is for and 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.989
 we have where to play and here we give 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.379
 to play and we're going to see basically how 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.379
 works 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.470
 and we fall right to the beach with our 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:52.640
 character 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:54.710
 and he says he lives in the waters I like 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.780
 pretty cool shoot alone then 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.460
 well let's go with the weapons here we go 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.560
 moving and here we go and we have 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.110
 to go studying the enemies without 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.150
 so no plane can reach us any 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:09.460
 artifact author that can destroy us 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:12.430
 it flies and says 500 meters 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.500
 with being piles moving from any 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.210
 child I have here because of the fast 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.610
 how can you see this weapon with a new 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.660
 shot works pretty cool and it 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.660
 will notice completely 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.300
 aimar and the truth we are a little 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.760
 complicated 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.760
 [Applause] 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.080
 for the chair but he worked or something 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.350
 what we are going to do is survive 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:48.480
 basically we are a game that weighs very 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:54.299
 little about 80 megabytes 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:54.299
 [Applause] 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.479
 there it will be, it's pretty good 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:04.860
 [Applause] 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.860
 We can put bullets and weapons 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:15.000
 [Applause] 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.349
 let's give it here to record our 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.709
 heading because we want to share the 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:25.780
 rise from youtube any other other 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.860
 reason we want as you can see 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.860
 apart is already recording 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.390
 we load aspects 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.440
 and now our 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.840
 enemies and then the game thus committed 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.000
 I hope you like it we will access the 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.819
 menu then let's go here we go to the 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.640
 main menu and let's see then how 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.350
 you see what is the part that we recorded 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.000
 so then we have here in the camera 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.630
 we can see what we recorded there 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.030
 is 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.340
 as a mini gameplay it serves as a 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:02.260
 screen record and then we can share it 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.260
 if we want here or can produce it 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.820
 I hope you like it and I hope that 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.530
