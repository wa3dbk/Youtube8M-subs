00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 mister gregory expulsions invasions of 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.590
 camp the president wanted to withdraw the 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:10.590
 team a match played and it turned out 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.990
 yes it is a game that in short does not match me 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.840
 I expected it to end like this and not me 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.320
 I refer if certainly to the result 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:22.439
 are certainly episodes to be condemned 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.750
 but sometimes the stakes are so 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.330
 high even in this tournament 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.100
 who can lead to extreme gestures that 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.619
 surely they don't have mine 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.449
 sharing as they did not have from 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.070
 iron part their coach then 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:36.570
 I congratulate the coach 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.210
 of the opposing team 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.890
 the first however went the fashion 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.390
 well played now but there is from 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.489
 fight even with the expulsion of 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.780
 enough that it complicates things a little 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.120
 in defense 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.960
 yes we say that also here today unfortunately 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.760
 we penalized ourselves on a ball 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.670
 that went outward enough 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.829
 wait to stall for a while and yes 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.539
 further expulsion would be avoided 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.000
 that in this moment is going to add up to 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.240
 that of the sorry iacono but on the other 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.650
 part have left so directly 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.360
 I 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.610
 tangled that can allow 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.550
 also losing his head should not 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.940
 happen but we leave there in this 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.710
 time to enjoy the party even if for 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.290
 little time because tomorrow we will be back 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.970
 at work also matera with four 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.190
 today the matera with i 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.140
 extra in the legs for the final 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.440
 with the photo you could see these are 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.290
 games that are played over the 120 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.710
 minutes maybe even something more 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.810
 it was also desirable considering that at least 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.920
 for us in both races we have 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.990
 had a parity result then 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.320
 it could happen even today it happened 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.210
 I'm sorry for giving the chance 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.000
 to have gone to the prof 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.340
 still overtime on a ball 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.790
 inactive so we should also review 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.710
 but something beyond the gods 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.140
 analysis and to try to analyze 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.729
 what 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.220
 did not go according to me it is to be appreciated 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.940
 especially the test of the boys in toto 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.940
 from the first to the last
