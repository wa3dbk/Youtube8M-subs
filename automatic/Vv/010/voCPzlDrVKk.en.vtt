had a slightly defective unit but it did

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.289 
had a slightly defective unit but it did
go<00:01:45.590> down<00:01:45.619> a<00:01:45.890> couple<00:01:46.100> times<00:01:46.369> in<00:01:46.700> the<00:01:46.939> bad<00:01:47.090> way

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
go down a couple times in the bad way

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.270 
go down a couple times in the bad way
it's<00:01:47.869> got<00:01:48.049> the<00:01:48.109> same<00:01:48.229> specs<00:01:48.590> as<00:01:48.710> the<00:01:48.859> G<00:01:49.009> slate

it's got the same specs as the G slate
and<00:01:49.460> the<00:01:49.640> zoom<00:01:49.880> so<00:01:50.210> that<00:01:50.359> means<00:01:50.630> it<00:01:50.810> should<00:01:50.840> be

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
and the zoom so that means it should be

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:52.959 
and the zoom so that means it should be
just<00:01:51.229> as<00:01:51.380> fast<00:01:51.590> right<00:01:51.859> yes<00:01:52.189> and<00:01:52.490> it<00:01:52.820> is

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:52.969 
just as fast right yes and it is

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:54.010
