00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.180
 that's not 4.14 and yes I have those 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.030
 Pachnotes always been through 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.750
 bit and want you to the following there 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.519
 the patch 4.14 is just about everything 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.300
 a new champion 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.460
 you can see it already and that's exactly what he is 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.470
 he will not come at once 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.789
 somehow gets up during the bachelors 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.710
 every case published when that be 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.220
 Of course you can say that 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.599
 we also want to see them soon 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.450
 what do they have something real 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.980
 game patch notes very funny you know 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:40.170
 not only how colors the championne 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:42.390
 change and yes at kassel at grass 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.100
 or the construction but changed the left 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.719
 always the full stand back though 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.239
 always stops when the first animals meet 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.219
 Canada on how a bit annoyed and 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.050
 Although you want a movie 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.210
 jumps and that's why we have the 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.850
 Debt increased to 20 I think pretty much 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.590
 blatant but well he was too 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.610
 always pretty often tied and shaped 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.070
 probably justified 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.830
 no one got a little attacking pace 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:11.560
 changed because there was a mistake but 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.560
 clue here had two header goals 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:19.920
 the doku cover changes the course of the 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.110
 Fashion reduces and also the today's 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.759
 match has been reduced that is one 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.170
 clear that means he was 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.930
 apparently still played so often 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.240
 and yes 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.150
 that's why they probably have 80 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:43.700
 probably also made again and that the 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:43.700
 make a tail 1 25 22 25 15 25 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:53.730
 airbus think this is wrong displayed 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.900
 I can not take 1000 exactly but 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.380
 I would have it would be unfair 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:01.740
 apparently have stayed that way 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:06.330
 I'm not sure how homer 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.130
 Definitely bucks enough strong of 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:12.480
 mullaittivu the country against the gang 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:15.379
 played and probably 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.510
 are still justified and indeed 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:20.519
 that's pretty much less 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.950
 life harm because it was pretty 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:25.620
 crass or pretty good as you would say 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.750
 is pretty strong in every case and 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.280
 the hand because then was also the 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.790
 bonus factors up kite track 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:39.000
 Three percent is limited 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:39.360
 and no longer 4/10 seconds increased 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.790
 been 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.890
 well okay 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.489
 or even ten seconds have been set 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.719
 say it did not work that way counts 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.230
 you can not just little of 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:52.049
 to let 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.750
 leave two hours at 110 seconds and 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:57.030
 Of course that is a small and 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.319
 pretty but things shit times 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.650
 played again very elegant more 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.450
 become 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.629
 We often think of the levels 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.629
 therefore 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.610
 if I'm not so good at it 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.870
 bit too strong I think 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.450
 now plays in no throw 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.709
 Anyway, morgana but on everyone 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.560
 also exactly because it was 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:17.000
 pretty much played or banned 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.590
 was somehow justified I think 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.629
 because she's pretty strong reporter 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.580
 was with the welsh to find but 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:23.060
 support moderately because they are very strong 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.280
 on road 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:29.959
 and that was why it was justified 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.420
 the shield is exactly what we would us 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.980
 magic touch blocked and at the volley 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.180
 annoyed that he does so much harm 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.710
 both the basic value and the 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:43.390
 total damage was annoyed 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:47.620
 so on in the month exactly that means 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:49.390
 the damage has gone down with it 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.340
 audiotechnology midfield management becomes 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.820
 sometimes a lot of damage and 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.010
 that's why it's good , too 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:59.310
 strengthen them until belz and not the 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:03.220
 Tectonic somehow yes was quite good 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:08.140
 he changed directly once when she did 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:10.260
 is increased at the head of k6 well 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.880
 okay, not really 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.340
 interesting but full the multi the 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.710
 was a bit annoyed, and indeed 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:21.370
 The range was increased if you 

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:23.650
 because it is warned to 1250 of 1850 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.680
 and the cooldown was also increased 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.480
 at least in the early stages of the 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.520
 each case after a longer played on 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.970
 I will think its green power the 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.970
 remained 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.340
 however, there will continue to be 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.520
 still only small mistakes were made 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.599
 fixed the work 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.550
 not really like that anymore 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:47.699
 Fantastic exactly the same 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:51.050
 Often you will see that you can take a break 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:53.870
 if you live through the volt 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:56.639
 very meek, I think that's it 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.349
 limited to 0 26 seconds between the 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.060
 committees 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:01.289
 beforehand should take the time off 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.879
 scaled that is no longer the case 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:07.530
 is now always six seconds then 

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:10.770
 myself was in my opinion one 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:13.020
 bit brought and that if they are 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.240
 Now reduce to when I am happy 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.310
 behind the goal 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.169
 rather than the goal that can be mine 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.789
 awareness can be bad 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.440
 basically, I would say that is 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:24.389
 quite good if you are behind goal and 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.310
 because there is still some phase for example 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:28.440
 Did you have it went longer 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.930
 to pass by the Tower alone 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.550
 actually quite cool 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.590
 depending on where more content is not 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.180
 of course, content has been so straight ever since 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.479
 unfortunately the tower is running 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:42.599
 behind it you have to look at MÃ¼nster use 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:44.699
 And still is the cool diego 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:45.870
 is now the quality units during 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:48.150
 sign of death on a very active 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.860
 that means one can now also a in 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.120
 to make the middle of July and none 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.870
 criminals go through 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.870
 Pretty cool 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.660
 Let's see, is played today and 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:01.530
 venture 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:04.360
 then a little something changed 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:07.330
 But violence is longer by the castle 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.250
 rather uninteresting and otherwise they have 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.710
 a little something changes good 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.150
 but not really 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.860
 interesting stuff is more 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.720
 therefore, fold the game as stands 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.450
 Restrictions can you through 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:23.040
 if you want to live and become warm 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:23.040
 as I said a bit changed 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.840
 they are not like that now 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:30.670
 so interesting not so the things 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:34.300
 the now crucial game internet 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:37.720
 make the community meet and 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.720
 humanity audio 

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:46.449
 9 cents come the noblesse fortune and 

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:48.520
 riot cale maybe also interesting 

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:50.550
 Good for you then I hope I had mine 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:53.589
 small abstract fall 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:55.779
 Patch notes 4.14 are now complete 

00:06:53.589 --> 00:06:57.249
 if nothing has fallen let me also 

00:06:55.779 --> 00:06:59.409
 like to thumb up there would be me 

00:06:57.249 --> 00:07:01.770
 happy and I'll just say until 

00:06:59.409 --> 00:07:01.770
 next time
