paintings<00:02:19.280> this<00:02:19.850> is<00:02:20.000> something<00:02:20.330> live<00:02:20.810> so<00:02:21.680> how

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
paintings this is something live so how

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.550 
paintings this is something live so how
does<00:02:21.890> that<00:02:22.040> fit<00:02:22.400> yeah<00:02:22.959> I<00:02:23.959> think<00:02:24.080> it's<00:02:24.320> great

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
does that fit yeah I think it's great

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.180 
does that fit yeah I think it's great
that<00:02:25.239> the<00:02:26.239> way<00:02:27.049> the<00:02:27.230> man<00:02:27.530> interacts<00:02:28.070> with

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
that the way the man interacts with

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.610 
that the way the man interacts with
nature<00:02:28.760> and<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.060> way<00:02:29.239> that

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
nature and the way that

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.080 
nature and the way that
of<00:02:29.709> the<00:02:29.860> different<00:02:30.370> interpretations<00:02:31.060> that

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
of the different interpretations that

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.440 
of the different interpretations that
are<00:02:31.239> taking<00:02:31.510> place<00:02:31.540> in<00:02:32.110> here<00:02:32.680> I<00:02:33.489> think<00:02:34.330> it's

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
are taking place in here I think it's

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.030 
are taking place in here I think it's
only<00:02:34.569> fitting<00:02:34.840> that<00:02:35.019> we<00:02:35.200> do<00:02:35.379> have<00:02:35.680> something

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
only fitting that we do have something

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.250 
only fitting that we do have something
live<00:02:36.489> and<00:02:36.940> of<00:02:37.269> course<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.540> thing<00:02:37.690> about<00:02:37.900> it

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
live and of course the thing about it

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.050 
live and of course the thing about it
being<00:02:38.530> live<00:02:38.860> and<00:02:39.099> what<00:02:39.190> we<00:02:39.280> say<00:02:39.489> about<00:02:39.519> bonsai

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
being live and what we say about bonsai

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.589 
being live and what we say about bonsai
is<00:02:40.360> it's<00:02:41.110> actually<00:02:41.260> art<00:02:41.709> in<00:02:41.950> four<00:02:42.340> dimensions

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
is it's actually art in four dimensions

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.479 
is it's actually art in four dimensions
the<00:02:43.599> fourth<00:02:43.930> dimension<00:02:44.110> being<00:02:44.620> time<00:02:44.980> right

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
the fourth dimension being time right

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.550 
the fourth dimension being time right
and<00:02:45.700> over<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:46.180> period<00:02:46.510> will<00:02:46.870> show<00:02:47.140> what<00:02:47.379> we're

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
and over the period will show what we're

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.009 
and over the period will show what we're
going<00:02:47.680> to<00:02:47.799> have<00:02:47.950> is<00:02:48.099> this<00:02:48.459> tree<00:02:48.819> is<00:02:49.180> then<00:02:49.810> leave

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
going to have is this tree is then leave

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.420 
going to have is this tree is then leave
now<00:02:50.260> but<00:02:50.530> it<00:02:50.620> was<00:02:50.799> slowly<00:02:51.159> bloom<00:02:51.640> bloom<00:02:52.629> pink

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
now but it was slowly bloom bloom pink

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.800 
now but it was slowly bloom bloom pink
so<00:02:54.430> what<00:02:54.640> we<00:02:54.760> looking<00:02:54.790> at<00:02:55.120> here<00:02:55.180> is<00:02:55.510> it<00:02:55.720> would

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
so what we looking at here is it would

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.750 
so what we looking at here is it would
be<00:02:55.959> it's<00:02:56.409> currently<00:02:56.709> here<00:02:56.950> but<00:02:57.430> over<00:02:57.670> the

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
be it's currently here but over the

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.550 
be it's currently here but over the
period<00:02:58.000> of<00:02:58.090> two<00:02:58.299> months<00:02:58.329> it<00:02:58.900> will<00:02:59.019> grow<00:02:59.290> out<00:02:59.319> of

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
period of two months it will grow out of

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.130 
period of two months it will grow out of
this<00:02:59.920> stage<00:03:00.700> and<00:03:01.000> will<00:03:01.299> be<00:03:01.420> full<00:03:01.750> of<00:03:01.900> paint

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
this stage and will be full of paint

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.809 
this stage and will be full of paint
flowers<00:03:02.410> so<00:03:02.920> it's<00:03:03.069> appropriate<00:03:03.609> that<00:03:03.640> this

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
flowers so it's appropriate that this

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:05.490 
flowers so it's appropriate that this
trees<00:03:04.090> in<00:03:04.299> this<00:03:04.390> exhibition<00:03:04.720> so<00:03:05.200> in<00:03:05.319> a<00:03:05.349> way

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
trees in this exhibition so in a way

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.809 
trees in this exhibition so in a way
this<00:03:05.709> is<00:03:05.890> going<00:03:06.040> to<00:03:06.129> grow<00:03:06.280> with<00:03:06.579> the

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
this is going to grow with the

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.660 
this is going to grow with the
exhibition<00:03:07.780> and<00:03:08.440> what<00:03:09.069> I'd<00:03:09.160> like<00:03:09.370> is<00:03:09.430> for

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
different tree it will transform over

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.599 
different tree it will transform over
the<00:03:19.420> period<00:03:19.659> of<00:03:19.780> the<00:03:19.900> show<00:03:20.370> fantastic<00:03:21.370> all
