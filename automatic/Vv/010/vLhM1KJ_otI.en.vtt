 always all kids welcome in 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.840
 this new episode of minecraft mod 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.090
 today we will finally talk about one 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.010
 of the new fashions updated 1.7 point 10 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.050
 others only change the name of 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.230
 those we have already done by the Hon 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.119
 look what a bad thing then the mountain 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.940
 I say let's talk is the smart moving 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.180
 for now I'll only show you fashions 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.579
 who need few crafting for 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.989
 Because of the lack of in would then 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.870
 to do all the tags for each 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.840
 object then this fashion thing 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.210
 introduces via the player to ping that is 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.120
 another mode that gives the possibility of 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:56.000
 do more movements to say the models 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.579
 of minecraft and through the mode itself 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.539
 called smart moving with a col his e 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:04.519
 a smart and rendering is called gives us the 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:08.030
 possibility to have more movements 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:11.660
 different in minecraft in what sense 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.420
 let's start from this I do see if 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:17.410
 wait until I get back to day because 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.410
 if you don't see anything 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:30.909
 ok ok now jump see this is the 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:34.030
 normal jump that is the leap empower 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:38.530
 it is shift and then jump is slightly 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:40.420
 higher then only those iron pants 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:46.140
 you have the opportunity to do this a 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:51.009
 jump and with ctrl hold on look 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:56.709
 look how cool the jump knows me 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:02:00.039
 it was a troll nora shift then you can 

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:03.450
 always go up with ctrl pressed will have to 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:07.119
 to the fans you see we can climb over them 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.640
 cloth on the wall do not work 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.049
 he will try to hold on to the race though 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.390
 for burgundy here is another thing 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:16.930
 by pressing ctrl pressed you can 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.130
 scroll along the edge effectively 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:23.079
 scrolling a little too fast 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:28.180
 lateral however there is something else to much thing 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:30.430
 cute is the ctrl plus shift going into 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.620
 ahead we can also pass through ducts 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:37.930
 in dimensions of a cube 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:40.810
 see if I'm not mistaken by holding 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.380
 ctrl there will also be a sprint and pressing 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:48.760
 shift on the fly we can go maybe 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:52.389
 then under panels with 1 see then 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.000
 good for great saves escapes in 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:56.889
 extremis 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.440
 ok other things that have been added by 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:01.870
 this smart living is the animation 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.720
 of the dive 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:08.519
 now he has not done and you do not tell me why 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.519
 knows why I didn't press ctrl maybe 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:12.239
 we find we try again 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:19.430
 is the thesis he saw then he should give 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.670
 also to the animation of a dive then 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.310
 us to try it now you will see here 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:28.330
 also another little thing because of 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.330
 smart moving 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.810
 so here it is more difficult to fly with 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:42.730
 the smart moving is sure we have 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:48.460
 already conceived then we see a little if 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:51.280
 it works now the dip is not there 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.840
 successful it goes well however it also adds 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.560
 a swimming animation as you can 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:59.370
 see very pretty to see in fact 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.370
 watch 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.810
 and cool when he is high in the water 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:09.609
 it swims differently but we do 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.900
 it affects this damn dive too 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:15.640
 when we want to make it look like us 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:18.910
 so let's say it's great what not 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.709
 so why not go to oh well anyway 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:24.190
 should also do the animation of a 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.870
 dip the practice divin instead not 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.520
 so it will definitely work 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.520
 made a few cappellas with solids 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:37.330
 anything 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:40.630
 and it goes well when I'm superman towards 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.699
 the infinite and in addition to good guys this 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.770
 it was the smart moving mode it didn't have 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:46.870
 need crafting because it's nothing 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.820
 that concerns the crafting adds of the 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:52.300
 very special things maybe nice and 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:55.389
 used in a customized map 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:59.080
 maybe like a prince of persia or 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:02.860
 the assassin's creed was day 1 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:05.949
