00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.730 
memory of a gb and both has a different
operating<00:01:05.040> system<00:01:05.540> motorola<00:01:06.540> a1<00:01:06.930> has<00:01:07.200> android

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
operating system motorola a1 has android

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.300 
operating system motorola a1 has android
4.4<00:01:08.490> point<00:01:08.850> for<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:09.810> kit<00:01:10.140> kat<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.560> in

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
4.4 point for that is kit kat and in

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.350 
4.4 point for that is kit kat and in
motorola<00:01:11.760> e<00:01:12.060> 2<00:01:12.420> 2nd<00:01:13.409> generation<00:01:13.619> has<00:01:14.360> android

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
motorola e 2 2nd generation has android

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.219 
motorola e 2 2nd generation has android
lollipop<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.500> 5.0<00:01:17.220> point2<00:01:17.780> so<00:01:18.780> basically

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
lollipop that is 5.0 point2 so basically

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.620 
lollipop that is 5.0 point2 so basically
the<00:01:19.439> interface<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:20.180> second<00:01:21.180> generation<00:01:21.240> is

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
the interface of second generation is

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.780 
the interface of second generation is
bit<00:01:21.900> different<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:22.770> again<00:01:23.280> coming<00:01:23.490> on<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.759> the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
bit different so again coming on to the

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.510 
bit different so again coming on to the
internal<00:01:24.360> storage<00:01:24.810> as<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.110> all<00:01:25.290> can<00:01:25.320> see<00:01:25.530> the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
internal storage as you all can see the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.090 
internal storage as you all can see the
internal<00:01:27.060> memory<00:01:27.390> in<00:01:27.570> motorola<00:01:28.439> first

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
internal memory in motorola first

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.350 
internal memory in motorola first
generation<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:31.310> 4gb<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.610> in<00:01:32.970> second

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
generation is 4gb and in second

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.660 
generation is 4gb and in second
generation<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:34.170> GV<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:35.070> there<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.369> more

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
generation is a GV so there is more

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.090 
generation is a GV so there is more
memory<00:01:36.030> for<00:01:36.270> users<00:01:36.780> in<00:01:36.930> motorola<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.740> second

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
memory for users in motorola a second

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.920 
memory for users in motorola a second
generation<00:01:39.799> so<00:01:40.799> again<00:01:41.130> now<00:01:41.340> i<00:01:41.369> will<00:01:41.750> check<00:01:42.750> the

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
generation so again now i will check the

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.030 
generation so again now i will check the
camera<00:01:43.259> quality<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.770> both<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.159> phones<00:01:44.630> so

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
camera quality of both the phones so

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.520 
camera quality of both the phones so
what<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.070> observed<00:01:47.549> is<00:01:47.729> in<00:01:47.970> motorola<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:49.140> first

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
what I observed is in motorola a first

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.859 
what I observed is in motorola a first
generation<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:50.189> camera<00:01:50.579> is<00:01:50.790> bit<00:01:51.360> more<00:01:51.570> clear

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
generation the camera is bit more clear

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.280 
generation the camera is bit more clear
than<00:01:52.939> motorola<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:54.270> second<00:01:54.659> generation<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:56.210> n

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
than motorola a second generation and n

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.260 
than motorola a second generation and n
motorola<00:01:58.290> e<00:01:58.500> first<00:01:59.399> generation<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.909> camera

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
motorola e first generation the camera

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.249 
motorola e first generation the camera
shows<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.780> true<00:02:01.140> colors<00:02:01.500> of<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:02.490> image

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
shows the true colors of the image

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.010 
shows the true colors of the image
whereas<00:02:04.259> in<00:02:04.469> mathura<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:05.159> second<00:02:05.520> generation

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
whereas in mathura a second generation

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.790 
whereas in mathura a second generation
the<00:02:07.020> camera<00:02:07.680> is<00:02:08.149> bit<00:02:09.770> bright

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
the camera is bit bright

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.840 
the camera is bit bright
or<00:02:12.000> you<00:02:13.000> can<00:02:13.180> say<00:02:13.390> the<00:02:13.540> image<00:02:13.840> is<00:02:13.990> bit<00:02:14.230> brighter

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
or you can say the image is bit brighter

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.270 
or you can say the image is bit brighter
than<00:02:15.850> the<00:02:15.910> actual<00:02:16.270> color<00:02:16.750> as<00:02:17.080> you<00:02:17.890> all<00:02:18.040> can<00:02:18.070> see

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
than the actual color as you all can see

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.840 
than the actual color as you all can see
in<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:19.200> camera<00:02:20.200> itself<00:02:20.350> and<00:02:20.740> it<00:02:21.280> also<00:02:21.490> has<00:02:21.670> a

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
in the camera itself and it also has a

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.990 
in the camera itself and it also has a
secondary<00:02:22.630> camera<00:02:23.020> that<00:02:23.170> is<00:02:23.290> a<00:02:23.320> VGA<00:02:23.770> camera<00:02:24.000> it

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
secondary camera that is a VGA camera it

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.910 
secondary camera that is a VGA camera it
also<00:02:25.180> makes<00:02:25.450> a<00:02:25.630> difference<00:02:25.990> of<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:28.360> gadget

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
also makes a difference of the gadget
