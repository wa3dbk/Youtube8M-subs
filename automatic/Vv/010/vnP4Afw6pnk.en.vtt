00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 good morning youtube friends then today 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.920
 I want to show you how to mount a rod 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.859
 from spinning 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.790
 now I will show you my cane and in others 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.250
 in my equipment 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.880
 this is an ultra spinning rod 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.580
 light let's say that more for low black 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.160
 or for the vertexes linked obviously is not 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.930
 for the lucio for other priests so then 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.150
 we have a shimano movement a 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.439
 2005 b 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:31.619
 sorry fb very good then now vi 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.120
 I'll explain a whip first thing 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.300
 have this picture but it has 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.559
 you will have to graft the prices over the 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.969
 price range go to put it in this way 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.640
 to see that all the breast rings 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.920
 even just put the leaning rod 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.440
 on the cheek with the ring in parallel 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.199
 in the nose and see with one eye closed 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.430
 all of which we are all to appear 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.640
 it must be said that they all fit together 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:02.660
 holes 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.660
 if you can stay, you can see 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:12.659
 all the holes match then we go to 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.760
 put our reel in that 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.570
 obviously this thing set so 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.450
 I put a steak bed underneath 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:23.549
 safety is one to avoid that maybe 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.970
 jerk or what you post me to me 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.829
 detachments emigrated into the water are 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.229
 allow you have to go don't put the 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.829
 first piece over then close it below 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:38.009
 so provision the elastic you see not 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:42.350
 then another step goes down a lot 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:53.450
 easy to bring to pass the thread 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:53.450
 between between the rings in this manner 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.310
 worried the first step is done 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:34.730
 the start of the mill made me 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.290
 pass the thread between the rings 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:41.480
 now take if you obviously have it 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:46.680
 sometimes you don't even need a dog on steel 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:48.810
 I will show you how I did it as I am 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:53.329
 facts then I have these here the model 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:55.530
 let's say that a little longer you see 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.599
 allow this you have a washer 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.989
 above in absolute a shot 9 April 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:05.190
 of the part with the washer enav ad 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:07.370
 get inside then let it do some 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.370
 rounds 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.080
 so 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:23.300
 a bird will do everything so 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.600
 pass the thread in the eyelet see 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:29.930
 eyelet this wants us to pass the 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.190
 thread it in then before finishing 9 I have it 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:36.110
 let rest in the buttonhole 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:40.210
 higher remains this remains open 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:49.000
 so you can get it back in here 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:52.990
 in this way he did once 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.520
 take and pull up in sickness drop 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:58.240
 then or with scissors 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:03.290
 you can find it with the mouth of wind 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:06.620
 very light I use a silico wire 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:11.950
 let's say a silicon va well is the first 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:14.060
 impact you have this here then finally 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:18.680
 depends on the personality and mount one 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:20.150
 city ​​car in several we put a first 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:28.730
 market for so long to make you right for 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:35.000
 make us realize we saw so schettino 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:43.970
 pushing it opens you put artificial 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:49.150
 inside and close here is a strange one 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:52.150
 turn off nothing complicated for ready 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.150
 concentrated 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:06.440
 I wanted to tell you something else 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:10.400
 there are many people having one 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:12.410
 room spinning always ask but me 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.160
 laganà a small donkey immediately after the 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.690
 handle 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.650
 obviously they talk about this here 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:22.880
 this one is nothing but a ring 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:24.680
 for here however it attacks German for waves 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.150
 avoid that you dance or that you are there 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:31.400
 he wanted the movement not divided 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:38.690
 attacks on the back of the clothes so I'm 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:39.319
 here they will be from pro life spinning to 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.599
 today is everything 

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:44.780
 we choose the next video hoping that 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:47.000
 but I manage a video with one 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:52.419
 nature 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.419
 nothing to see you soon friends of youtube
