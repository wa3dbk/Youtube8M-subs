00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
from the back of the fabric come up and

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.170 
from the back of the fabric come up and
then<00:00:42.960> do<00:00:43.200> one<00:00:43.410> small<00:00:43.739> stitch<00:00:44.250> maybe<00:00:44.520> about<00:00:44.940> two

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
then do one small stitch maybe about two

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.990 
then do one small stitch maybe about two
two<00:00:45.989> millimeters<00:00:46.469> long<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.039> then<00:00:47.640> go<00:00:47.820> down

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
two millimeters long and then go down

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.910 
two millimeters long and then go down
into<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.390> fabric<00:00:48.719> again<00:00:49.020> when<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.649> come<00:00:49.800> up

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
into the fabric again when you come up

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.380 
into the fabric again when you come up
for<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.190> second<00:00:50.579> stitch<00:00:50.789> you're<00:00:51.030> going<00:00:51.059> to

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
for the second stitch you're going to

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.110 
for the second stitch you're going to
start<00:00:51.780> about<00:00:52.199> two<00:00:52.770> millimeters<00:00:53.129> past<00:00:54.410> and

start about two millimeters past and

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.729 
start about two millimeters past and
then<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.329> way<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.570> can<00:00:57.840> go<00:00:57.960> backwards<00:00:58.260> and

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
then that way you can go backwards and

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.069 
then that way you can go backwards and
you<00:00:58.859> can<00:00:59.010> close<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.520> gap<00:00:59.789> it's<00:01:00.420> much<00:01:00.660> easier

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
you can close that gap it's much easier

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.219 
you can close that gap it's much easier
to<00:01:01.320> get<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.739> closed<00:01:02.160> gap<00:01:02.489> if<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:03.120> go<00:01:03.960> backwards

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
to get a closed gap if you go backwards

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.960 
to get a closed gap if you go backwards
for<00:01:04.680> that<00:01:04.799> stitch<00:01:05.100> then<00:01:05.309> if<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.519> try<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.790> come

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
for that stitch then if you try and come

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.670 
for that stitch then if you try and come
up<00:01:06.090> right<00:01:06.240> beside<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.689> first<00:01:07.200> stitch<00:01:07.439> then

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
up right beside that first stitch then

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.530 
up right beside that first stitch then
when<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.549> come<00:01:08.729> up<00:01:08.850> again<00:01:09.119> you're<00:01:09.330> going<00:01:09.479> to

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
when you come up again you're going to

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:17.149 
when you come up again you're going to
go<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.930> end<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.590> stitch

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.010 

and<00:01:17.579> it<00:01:17.820> should<00:01:18.060> take<00:01:18.210> about<00:01:18.360> three<00:01:18.509> stitches

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
stitch after you've done the first

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.570 
stitch after you've done the first
stitch<00:02:08.660> the<00:02:09.289> second<00:02:09.709> stitch<00:02:09.920> will<00:02:10.190> come<00:02:10.429> up

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
stitch the second stitch will come up

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.610 
stitch the second stitch will come up
about<00:02:10.819> halfway<00:02:11.150> through<00:02:11.390> that<00:02:11.989> first<00:02:12.260> stitch

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
about halfway through that first stitch

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.040 
about halfway through that first stitch
and<00:02:12.920> split<00:02:13.220> it<00:02:13.310> in<00:02:13.400> half<00:02:13.810> so<00:02:14.810> you're<00:02:14.930> actually

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
and split it in half so you're actually

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.729 
and split it in half so you're actually
splitting<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:15.769> threads<00:02:16.100> in<00:02:16.340> half<00:02:20.620> so<00:02:21.620> when

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
splitting the threads in half so when

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:30.900 
splitting the threads in half so when
it's<00:02:21.890> done<00:02:22.100> it<00:02:22.250> looks<00:02:22.400> almost<00:02:22.580> like<00:02:22.730> a<00:02:22.850> chain

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.360 

so<00:02:31.480> I'm<00:02:31.540> just<00:02:31.720> finishing<00:02:31.900> up<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.440> mouth<00:02:32.620> I'm

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:19.979 
extra fabric as well and then use a

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:25.460 
extra fabric as well and then use a
chopstick<00:05:20.550> to<00:05:20.580> turn<00:05:20.820> right<00:05:21.000> side<00:05:21.180> out<00:05:24.470> repeat

chopstick to turn right side out repeat
those<00:05:25.650> steps<00:05:25.800> for<00:05:26.310> the<00:05:26.430> second<00:05:26.759> arm<00:05:26.910> as<00:05:27.120> well

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
those steps for the second arm as well

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
the arms are fairly tiny and so to stuff

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.159 
the arms are fairly tiny and so to stuff
them<00:05:32.699> with<00:05:32.729> the<00:05:32.910> fiberfill<00:05:33.419> I<00:05:33.570> just<00:05:33.780> take<00:05:33.930> very

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:34.169 
them with the fiberfill I just take very

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:38.029 
them with the fiberfill I just take very
small<00:05:34.320> Tufts<00:05:35.310> of<00:05:35.900> fiberfill<00:05:36.900> at<00:05:37.020> a<00:05:37.080> time<00:05:37.289> and<00:05:37.560> I

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 
small Tufts of fiberfill at a time and I

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:39.469 
small Tufts of fiberfill at a time and I
kind<00:05:38.310> of<00:05:38.370> put<00:05:38.580> it<00:05:38.669> in<00:05:38.759> there<00:05:38.910> with<00:05:39.000> my<00:05:39.180> thumbs

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 
kind of put it in there with my thumbs

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:42.620 
kind of put it in there with my thumbs
and<00:05:39.780> then<00:05:40.550> finish<00:05:41.550> that<00:05:41.789> with<00:05:41.970> a<00:05:42.000> chopstick

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
and then finish that with a chopstick

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.770 
and then finish that with a chopstick
and<00:05:43.080> push<00:05:43.440> it<00:05:43.560> all<00:05:43.680> the<00:05:43.710> way<00:05:43.830> to<00:05:43.949> the<00:05:44.099> end<00:05:44.780> the

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
and push it all the way to the end the

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.990 
and push it all the way to the end the
arms<00:05:45.960> should<00:05:46.199> be<00:05:46.259> stuffed<00:05:46.620> fairly<00:05:47.070> firmly<00:05:47.370> you

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
arms should be stuffed fairly firmly you

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.129 
arms should be stuffed fairly firmly you
want<00:05:48.150> to<00:05:48.210> make<00:05:48.330> sure<00:05:48.509> that<00:05:48.660> they<00:05:48.780> hold<00:05:48.930> their

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:49.139 
want to make sure that they hold their

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:51.200 
want to make sure that they hold their
shape<00:05:49.169> and<00:05:49.889> I'd<00:05:50.190> stop<00:05:50.520> about<00:05:50.820> a<00:05:50.880> half<00:05:51.060> inch

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
shape and I'd stop about a half inch

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.780 
shape and I'd stop about a half inch
from<00:05:51.360> the<00:05:51.630> end
