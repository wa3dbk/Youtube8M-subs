ways you can do it on Honda makes a

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.100 
ways you can do it on Honda makes a
socket<00:01:31.380> that's<00:01:31.590> actually<00:01:32.009> got<00:01:32.840> grooves<00:01:33.840> cut

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
socket that's actually got grooves cut

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.350 
socket that's actually got grooves cut
into<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.530> fit<00:01:34.799> in<00:01:34.920> here<00:01:35.159> I'll<00:01:35.790> zoom<00:01:35.850> in<00:01:36.299> a

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
into it to fit in here I'll zoom in a

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.490 
into it to fit in here I'll zoom in a
little<00:01:36.450> more<00:01:36.570> here<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.200> can<00:01:37.290> see<00:01:37.409> it

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
little more here so you can see it

better
you<00:01:40.380> see<00:01:40.560> there's<00:01:40.740> grooves<00:01:41.610> grooves<00:01:42.299> into<00:01:42.659> it

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
you see there's grooves grooves into it

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.050 
you see there's grooves grooves into it
here<00:01:42.990> or<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.200> can<00:01:44.100> drive<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.670> poor<00:01:44.850> man's

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
put it in the groove here and hit it

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.730 
put it in the groove here and hit it
around<00:01:56.930> which<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:58.140> right<00:01:58.290> now<00:01:58.409> it's<00:01:58.560> loose

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
around which is right now it's loose

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
to go to your left so so in that way you

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.340 
to go to your left so so in that way you
would<00:02:03.930> it<00:02:04.530> would<00:02:04.649> move<00:02:04.770> this<00:02:04.950> in<00:02:05.100> looseness<00:02:05.280> or

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
would it would move this in looseness or

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.900 
would it would move this in looseness or
tighten<00:02:07.350> back<00:02:07.439> up<00:02:07.680> or<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.429> could<00:02:08.550> use<00:02:08.759> this

tighten back up or you could use this

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.440 
tighten back up or you could use this

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
can take a bolt right here and push it

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.839 
can take a bolt right here and push it
in<00:02:34.690> and<00:02:34.930> it<00:02:35.110> grips<00:02:35.349> on<00:02:35.530> to<00:02:35.769> it<00:02:35.890> if<00:02:36.430> you<00:02:36.519> can<00:02:36.549> turn

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
in and it grips on to it if you can turn

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:40.860 
in and it grips on to it if you can turn
it<00:02:37.319> so<00:02:38.319> you<00:02:38.819> would<00:02:39.819> simply<00:02:39.970> put<00:02:40.299> that<00:02:40.480> on<00:02:40.629> on

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
it so you would simply put that on on

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.800 
it so you would simply put that on on
here<00:02:41.830> push<00:02:42.430> hard<00:02:42.700> and<00:02:42.849> you'd<00:02:43.299> be<00:02:43.420> able<00:02:43.480> to<00:02:43.660> turn

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
here push hard and you'd be able to turn

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.449 
here push hard and you'd be able to turn
it<00:02:43.930> in<00:02:44.049> that<00:02:44.200> way<00:02:44.380> but<00:02:44.680> that's<00:02:44.860> made<00:02:45.069> by<00:02:45.190> Gator

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
it in that way but that's made by Gator

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.190 
it in that way but that's made by Gator
and<00:02:45.819> make<00:02:46.090> two<00:02:46.239> sizes<00:02:46.660> you<00:02:46.750> want<00:02:46.840> the<00:02:46.989> bigger

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
and make two sizes you want the bigger

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.920 
and make two sizes you want the bigger
size<00:02:47.530> but<00:02:48.280> it's<00:02:48.519> pretty<00:02:48.700> cool<00:02:48.910> it's<00:02:49.390> a<00:02:49.569> good

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.790 
the other reason why I do it I don't
know<00:05:28.880> if<00:05:28.970> this<00:05:29.090> is<00:05:29.120> right<00:05:29.390> or<00:05:29.600> not<00:05:29.690> but<00:05:30.050> these

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
know if this is right or not but these

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.470 
know if this is right or not but these
metal<00:05:31.280> discs<00:05:32.030> have<00:05:32.600> been<00:05:32.810> in<00:05:32.960> this<00:05:33.140> stack<00:05:33.440> of

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:34.480 
metal discs have been in this stack of

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.000 
metal discs have been in this stack of
clutches<00:05:35.480> for<00:05:35.750> its<00:05:35.930> entire<00:05:36.140> life<00:05:36.470> sometimes

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.010 
clutches for its entire life sometimes

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.630 
clutches for its entire life sometimes
30-some<00:05:37.520> years<00:05:37.550> and<00:05:38.090> it's<00:05:38.300> use<00:05:38.660> of<00:05:38.810> these

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:39.640 
30-some years and it's use of these

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.100 
30-some years and it's use of these
different<00:05:40.640> shift<00:05:41.030> patterns<00:05:41.480> and<00:05:41.690> I<00:05:41.750> just<00:05:41.930> keep

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
different shift patterns and I just keep

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.620 
different shift patterns and I just keep
the<00:05:42.290> same<00:05:42.500> disk<00:05:42.770> in<00:05:43.370> the<00:05:43.640> same<00:05:43.820> spot<00:05:44.120> in<00:05:44.420> the

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.630 
the same disk in the same spot in the

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.720 
the same disk in the same spot in the
clutch<00:05:44.870> basket<00:05:45.500> here<00:05:46.040> just<00:05:46.340> to<00:05:46.490> make<00:05:46.670> sure

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:46.730 
clutch basket here just to make sure

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.750 
clutch basket here just to make sure
that<00:05:47.240> if<00:05:47.480> this<00:05:48.260> was<00:05:48.500> worn<00:05:48.800> or<00:05:48.980> specific<00:05:49.610> way

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760 
that if this was worn or specific way

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.190 
that if this was worn or specific way
for<00:05:49.970> that<00:05:50.090> pressure<00:05:50.330> for<00:05:50.600> those<00:05:50.690> thirty<00:05:50.990> some

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:51.200 
for that pressure for those thirty some

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.650 
for that pressure for those thirty some
years<00:05:51.230> it's<00:05:52.010> the<00:05:52.190> same<00:05:52.400> ring<00:05:52.700> that's<00:05:52.910> doing<00:05:53.540> it

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:53.660 
years it's the same ring that's doing it

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:54.850 
years it's the same ring that's doing it
not<00:05:53.810> different<00:05:54.200> ring<00:05:54.350> at<00:05:54.560> different

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
not different ring at different

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.110 
not different ring at different
pressures<00:05:55.190> or<00:05:55.340> stuff<00:05:55.460> like<00:05:55.520> that<00:05:55.640> that's<00:05:56.030> just

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 
pressures or stuff like that that's just

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.610 
pressures or stuff like that that's just
a<00:05:56.240> little<00:05:56.420> note<00:05:56.540> on<00:05:56.660> my<00:05:56.780> throw<00:05:56.960> in<00:05:57.110> there<00:05:57.290> but

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620 
a little note on my throw in there but

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.560 
a little note on my throw in there but
I'm<00:05:57.710> almost<00:05:57.920> done<00:05:58.250> here<00:05:58.460> and<00:05:58.640> I'll<00:05:59.030> start

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
I'm almost done here and I'll start

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.390 
I'm almost done here and I'll start
assembling<00:06:00.080> it<00:06:00.260> now<00:06:00.380> and<00:06:00.680> I'll<00:06:01.010> throw<00:06:01.280> in

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
assembling it now and I'll throw in

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.880 
assembling it now and I'll throw in
another<00:06:01.490> video
