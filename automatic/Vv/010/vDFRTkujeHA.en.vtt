ranger or Verde an emissary I've been
kind<00:01:07.820> of<00:01:07.850> going<00:01:07.939> back<00:01:08.240> and<00:01:08.390> forth<00:01:08.659> but<00:01:08.930> the

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
kind of going back and forth but the

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.980 
kind of going back and forth but the
idea<00:01:09.799> is<00:01:09.860> just<00:01:10.100> to<00:01:10.219> be<00:01:10.399> more<00:01:10.610> aggressive<00:01:10.960> so<00:01:11.960> I

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
idea is just to be more aggressive so I

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.680 
idea is just to be more aggressive so I
splashed<00:01:12.530> actually<00:01:13.070> blue<00:01:13.400> which<00:01:13.940> seems<00:01:14.479> odd

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
splashed actually blue which seems odd

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.289

and yet targeting it is hard so the

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.010 
and yet targeting it is hard so the
illusion<00:01:55.880> factor<00:01:56.299> kind<00:01:56.960> of<00:01:57.079> loses<00:01:57.409> its<00:01:57.439> like

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
illusion factor kind of loses its like

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.149 
illusion factor kind of loses its like
capability<00:02:00.020> I<00:02:00.079> mean<00:02:00.229> like<00:02:00.380> they<00:02:00.560> can't<00:02:00.799> just

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
capability I mean like they can't just

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.010 
capability I mean like they can't just
automatically<00:02:01.670> nuke<00:02:02.030> the<00:02:02.299> illusion<00:02:02.750> because

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
automatically nuke the illusion because

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.399 
automatically nuke the illusion because
you<00:02:03.170> have<00:02:03.320> hexproof<00:02:03.649> so<00:02:04.549> you've<00:02:04.939> got<00:02:05.409> the

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
you have hexproof so you've got the

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.350 
you have hexproof so you've got the
added<00:02:06.619> bonus<00:02:06.950> of<00:02:07.989> hexproof<00:02:08.989> which<00:02:09.590> makes<00:02:09.860> the

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
added bonus of hexproof which makes the

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.740 
added bonus of hexproof which makes the
the<00:02:11.360> phantasmal<00:02:11.900> image<00:02:11.989> that<00:02:12.530> much<00:02:12.739> better<00:02:13.010> so

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
the phantasmal image that much better so

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.179 
the phantasmal image that much better so
that's<00:02:14.750> where<00:02:14.989> I'm<00:02:15.079> at<00:02:15.230> with<00:02:15.260> it<00:02:15.409> I'm<00:02:15.769> playing

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:16.189 
that's where I'm at with it I'm playing

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:18.250 
that's where I'm at with it I'm playing
around<00:02:16.370> with<00:02:16.519> a<00:02:16.609> few<00:02:16.819> slots<00:02:17.059> I<00:02:17.480> for<00:02:18.109> out<00:02:18.230> a

around with a few slots I for out a

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.220 
around with a few slots I for out a
daily<00:02:18.769> with<00:02:19.309> it<00:02:19.489> and<00:02:19.700> its<00:02:19.939> first<00:02:20.180> daily<00:02:20.569> run

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.460 
getting ideas about what relevant decks
there<00:02:44.030> are<00:02:44.180> and<00:02:44.510> then<00:02:44.660> what<00:02:44.810> I<00:02:44.840> need<00:02:45.080> to<00:02:45.110> change

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
about them so I change them so what you

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.729 
about them so I change them so what you
see<00:02:49.370> on<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:49.790> site<00:02:50.150> is<00:02:50.360> up<00:02:50.900> to<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.230> minute<00:02:51.379> and

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
see on the site is up to the minute and

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.130 
see on the site is up to the minute and
that<00:02:52.610> is<00:02:52.819> what<00:02:53.060> I<00:02:53.329> would<00:02:53.450> recommend<00:02:53.720> going

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
that is what I would recommend going

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.190 
that is what I would recommend going
forward<00:02:54.799> now<00:02:55.010> this<00:02:55.579> is<00:02:55.730> a<00:02:55.760> definite<00:02:56.750> medical

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
forward now this is a definite medical

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.640 
forward now this is a definite medical
deck<00:02:57.440> but<00:02:58.400> I<00:02:58.430> think<00:02:58.519> it's<00:02:58.819> actually<00:02:59.000> very<00:02:59.650> hard

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
deck but I think it's actually very hard

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.259 
deck but I think it's actually very hard
to<00:03:00.769> beat<00:03:00.920> for<00:03:01.190> like<00:03:01.340> any<00:03:01.549> decks<00:03:01.819> I<00:03:01.970> think<00:03:02.150> it's

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
to beat for like any decks I think it's

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:07.990 
to beat for like any decks I think it's
a<00:03:02.329> great<00:03:02.480> F&amp;M<00:03:02.989> deck<00:03:03.200> also<00:03:04.299> but<00:03:06.099> valla<00:03:07.099> cute<00:03:07.459> can

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
a great F&amp;M deck also but valla cute can

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.550 
a great F&amp;M deck also but valla cute can
be<00:03:08.120> a<00:03:08.150> fairly<00:03:08.390> tough<00:03:08.660> matchup<00:03:09.140> you<00:03:09.379> need<00:03:09.530> a

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
be a fairly tough matchup you need a

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.229 
be a fairly tough matchup you need a
really<00:03:09.890> fast<00:03:10.010> starting<00:03:10.670> hand<00:03:10.910> so<00:03:11.090> if<00:03:11.150> you

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
really fast starting hand so if you

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.059 
really fast starting hand so if you
ready<00:03:11.480> playing<00:03:11.690> against<00:03:11.900> valla<00:03:12.109> coop<00:03:12.379> go

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
ready playing against valla coop go

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.190 
ready playing against valla coop go
ahead<00:03:13.370> the<00:03:14.000> sideboard<00:03:14.420> definitely<00:03:14.870> helps<00:03:15.109> a

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
ahead the sideboard definitely helps a

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.449 
ahead the sideboard definitely helps a
lot<00:03:15.379> so<00:03:15.819> here<00:03:16.819> we<00:03:16.879> go<00:03:16.970> this<00:03:17.510> is<00:03:18.040> fairly<00:03:19.040> slow

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
lot so here we go this is fairly slow

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.369 
lot so here we go this is fairly slow
actually<00:03:20.090> and<00:03:20.329> I'm<00:03:20.540> not<00:03:20.690> I<00:03:20.930> don't<00:03:21.109> think<00:03:21.170> I

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:21.379 
actually and I'm not I don't think I

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:24.479 
actually and I'm not I don't think I
knew<00:03:21.650> what<00:03:21.799> I<00:03:21.829> was<00:03:21.980> playing<00:03:22.280> against<00:03:22.640> yet<00:03:23.470> but

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
knew what I was playing against yet but

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.190 
knew what I was playing against yet but
it's<00:03:25.489> a<00:03:25.639> pretty<00:03:25.880> solid<00:03:26.269> hand<00:03:26.690> because<00:03:27.019> these

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
it's a pretty solid hand because these

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.750 
it's a pretty solid hand because these
are<00:03:27.349> the<00:03:27.470> cards<00:03:27.680> you<00:03:27.859> want<00:03:28.040> to<00:03:28.160> see<00:03:28.340> normally

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
are the cards you want to see normally

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.640 
are the cards you want to see normally
you<00:03:28.849> want<00:03:29.000> to<00:03:29.090> see<00:03:29.209> a<00:03:29.239> first<00:03:29.480> turn<00:03:29.690> birds<00:03:29.989> the

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
you want to see a first turn birds the

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.759 
you want to see a first turn birds the
reason<00:03:31.040> there's<00:03:31.310> a<00:03:31.430> six<00:03:32.299> turn<00:03:32.840> one<00:03:33.049> mana<00:03:33.380> dorks

reason there's a six turn one mana dorks

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.309 
reason there's a six turn one mana dorks
is<00:03:33.950> because<00:03:34.250> you<00:03:34.400> want<00:03:34.669> to<00:03:34.760> hit<00:03:34.970> them<00:03:35.319> because

is because you want to hit them because

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:38.440 
is because you want to hit them because

it<00:04:19.340> but<00:04:19.549> there<00:04:20.150> was<00:04:20.269> nothing<00:04:20.419> really<00:04:20.810> to<00:04:20.930> ramp

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
it but there was nothing really to ramp

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.469 
it but there was nothing really to ramp
into<00:04:21.349> so<00:04:22.190> wasn't<00:04:22.520> proving<00:04:22.820> like<00:04:23.000> effective

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 
into so wasn't proving like effective

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:25.510 
into so wasn't proving like effective
enough<00:04:23.690> I<00:04:23.870> needed<00:04:24.169> more<00:04:24.470> resilient<00:04:25.099> card<00:04:25.370> at

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
enough I needed more resilient card at

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.969 
enough I needed more resilient card at
two<00:04:25.699> so<00:04:26.000> I'm<00:04:26.479> opting<00:04:26.840> for<00:04:26.870> spell<00:04:27.199> sky<00:04:27.470> as<00:04:27.740> well

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979 
two so I'm opting for spell sky as well

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:29.350 
two so I'm opting for spell sky as well
as<00:04:28.160> Sylvan<00:04:28.550> Rangers<00:04:28.849> because<00:04:29.060> you<00:04:29.180> definitely

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
as Sylvan Rangers because you definitely

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.089 
as Sylvan Rangers because you definitely

done groves to be as big as possible for

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.540 
done groves to be as big as possible for
a<00:04:33.860> lot<00:04:34.190> of<00:04:34.370> reasons

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
a lot of reasons

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.659 
a lot of reasons
mainly<00:04:37.550> to<00:04:37.669> kill<00:04:37.880> them<00:04:39.130> so<00:04:40.130> the<00:04:40.250> hand<00:04:40.460> just

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
mainly to kill them so the hand just

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:42.400 
mainly to kill them so the hand just
kept<00:04:40.850> getting<00:04:40.940> better<00:04:41.180> now<00:04:41.780> the<00:04:41.870> thing<00:04:41.960> here

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
kept getting better now the thing here

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.530 
kept getting better now the thing here
is<00:04:42.590> we<00:04:43.370> could<00:04:43.520> have<00:04:43.639> just<00:04:43.820> you<00:04:44.180> know<00:04:44.210> they're

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
is we could have just you know they're

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:45.909 
is we could have just you know they're
sitting<00:04:44.870> on<00:04:44.930> leaked<00:04:45.169> we<00:04:45.350> knew<00:04:45.470> that<00:04:45.500> we<00:04:45.800> knew

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
sitting on leaked we knew that we knew

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:47.379 
sitting on leaked we knew that we knew
they<00:04:46.070> probably<00:04:46.280> had<00:04:46.520> it<00:04:46.550> so<00:04:47.120> the<00:04:47.270> obvious

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
they probably had it so the obvious

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:51.129 
they probably had it so the obvious
option<00:04:47.840> here<00:04:48.200> was<00:04:48.410> vengevine<00:04:48.950> and<00:04:49.930> if<00:04:50.930> you're

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
option here was vengevine and if you're

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.310 
option here was vengevine and if you're
vengevine<00:04:51.500> pro<00:04:52.300> you<00:04:53.300> want<00:04:53.570> them<00:04:53.750> to<00:04:53.780> leak<00:04:54.080> that

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
vengevine pro you want them to leak that

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.310 
vengevine pro you want them to leak that
so<00:04:54.620> that<00:04:54.770> you<00:04:54.889> can<00:04:55.810> get<00:04:56.810> some<00:04:56.960> card<00:04:57.169> advantage

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
so that you can get some card advantage

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.280 
so that you can get some card advantage
out<00:04:57.740> of<00:04:57.889> it<00:04:58.330> now<00:04:59.330> Gideon's<00:04:59.720> been<00:04:59.870> a<00:04:59.930> little<00:05:00.110> bit

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
out of it now Gideon's been a little bit

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.500 
out of it now Gideon's been a little bit
of<00:05:00.320> a<00:05:00.470> problem<00:05:00.680> but<00:05:01.550> that's<00:05:01.940> okay<00:05:02.300> actually

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
of a problem but that's okay actually

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.150 
of a problem but that's okay actually
because<00:05:02.750> we<00:05:02.990> can<00:05:03.139> generally<00:05:03.530> put<00:05:03.740> Cobb<00:05:03.950> late

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
because we can generally put Cobb late

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.860 
because we can generally put Cobb late
on<00:05:04.280> their<00:05:04.370> heels<00:05:04.580> fast<00:05:05.090> enough<00:05:05.450> to<00:05:05.600> wear<00:05:05.720> them

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
on their heels fast enough to wear them

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.930 
on their heels fast enough to wear them
when<00:05:06.020> they<00:05:06.139> drop<00:05:06.440> Gideon<00:05:06.860> Gideon<00:05:07.400> just<00:05:07.729> going

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
when they drop Gideon Gideon just going

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.060 
when they drop Gideon Gideon just going
to<00:05:08.000> die<00:05:08.210> and<00:05:08.510> Gideon<00:05:09.139> can't<00:05:09.380> really<00:05:09.650> target

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
to die and Gideon can't really target

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.050 
to die and Gideon can't really target
most<00:05:10.729> you<00:05:10.940> guys<00:05:11.090> anyways<00:05:11.979> so<00:05:12.979> he<00:05:13.550> has<00:05:13.790> them<00:05:13.940> and

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
most you guys anyways so he has them and

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.879 
most you guys anyways so he has them and
as<00:05:14.240> much<00:05:14.479> of<00:05:14.630> a<00:05:14.720> problem<00:05:14.930> as<00:05:15.110> you<00:05:15.260> think<00:05:15.500> for

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:15.889 
as much of a problem as you think for

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:18.310 
as much of a problem as you think for
like<00:05:16.130> a<00:05:16.160> weird<00:05:16.850> looking<00:05:17.240> mono<00:05:17.720> green<00:05:18.050> deck

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
like a weird looking mono green deck

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.260 
like a weird looking mono green deck
like<00:05:18.530> this<00:05:18.740> and<00:05:18.950> the<00:05:19.340> reason<00:05:19.520> I<00:05:19.729> put<00:05:19.940> two

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
like this and the reason I put two

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.480 
like this and the reason I put two
islands<00:05:20.750> instead<00:05:21.080> of<00:05:21.320> one<00:05:21.530> is<00:05:21.740> because<00:05:22.340> there

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
islands instead of one is because there

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.390 
islands instead of one is because there
are<00:05:22.580> acidic<00:05:23.000> slimes<00:05:23.240> around<00:05:23.600> and<00:05:24.280> the<00:05:25.280> only

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
are acidic slimes around and the only

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.250 
are acidic slimes around and the only
other<00:05:25.520> option<00:05:25.850> you<00:05:26.120> have<00:05:26.150> is<00:05:26.750> birds<00:05:27.110> of

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.260 
other option you have is birds of

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.320 
other option you have is birds of
paradise<00:05:27.380> after<00:05:27.860> that<00:05:28.160> point<00:05:28.400> so<00:05:28.700> you<00:05:29.030> want

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
paradise after that point so you want

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.540 
paradise after that point so you want
one<00:05:29.510> extra<00:05:32.440> you<00:05:33.440> can't<00:05:33.680> spell<00:05:33.919> pierce<00:05:34.130> is<00:05:34.370> so

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
one extra you can't spell pierce is so

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.150 
one extra you can't spell pierce is so
we're<00:05:34.700> going<00:05:34.820> to<00:05:34.880> get<00:05:35.000> through<00:05:35.060> for<00:05:35.540> some

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
we're going to get through for some

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.620 
we're going to get through for some
really<00:05:37.160> good<00:05:37.280> damage<00:05:37.700> and<00:05:38.000> you<00:05:38.510> know

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
really good damage and you know

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.200 
really good damage and you know
obviously<00:05:39.340> what<00:05:40.340> is<00:05:40.430> he<00:05:40.490> going<00:05:40.610> to<00:05:40.669> do<00:05:40.820> I<00:05:40.850> had

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
obviously what is he going to do I had

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.190
