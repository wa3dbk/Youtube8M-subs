00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
might know what is by by the name what

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.599 
might know what is by by the name what
when<00:00:24.269> it<00:00:24.390> shows<00:00:24.750> up<00:00:24.779> obviously<00:00:25.109> or<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.519> can

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
when it shows up obviously or it can

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.810 
when it shows up obviously or it can
already<00:00:26.760> be<00:00:27.029> loaded<00:00:27.359> up<00:00:27.449> like<00:00:27.750> this<00:00:28.670> it's<00:00:29.670> a

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820

sister oh I didn't mean to do that but
oh<00:00:53.059> tar<00:00:55.789> ok<00:00:56.789> so<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:57.090> time

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
oh tar ok so this time

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.900 
oh tar ok so this time
we're<00:00:57.480> going<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.690> launch<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.079> first<00:00:58.879> and<00:00:59.879> then

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
we're going to launch it first and then

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.360 
we're going to launch it first and then
see<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.390> we<00:01:00.600> can<00:01:00.750> switch<00:01:00.960> control<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:02.160> I'm<00:01:02.219> not

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
see a we can switch control so I'm not

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.520 
see a we can switch control so I'm not
quite<00:01:02.550> sure<00:01:02.579> what<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:02.969> meant<00:01:03.359> by<00:01:03.719> switch

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
quite sure what you meant by switch

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.020 
quite sure what you meant by switch
control<00:01:04.860> I'm<00:01:05.250> pretty<00:01:05.489> sure<00:01:05.580> I've<00:01:05.729> got<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.939> try

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
control I'm pretty sure I've got to try

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.500 
control I'm pretty sure I've got to try
and<00:01:06.210> find<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:07.670> ok<00:01:08.840> here<00:01:09.840> we<00:01:09.869> have<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:11.510> it's

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
and find it ok here we have it it's

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.780 
and find it ok here we have it it's
where<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.720> driver<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:13.619> it's<00:01:13.770> in<00:01:13.890> here<00:01:14.600> yes

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
where the driver is so it's in here yes

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:29.149 
where the driver is so it's in here yes
that's<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.970> battery<00:01:20.630> the<00:01:21.630> driver<00:01:21.930> would<00:01:22.110> be

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.719 

there's<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.880> thing<00:01:30.090> where<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.390> driver<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.749> I

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
there's a thing where the driver is I

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.809 
there's a thing where the driver is I
may<00:01:32.729> need<00:01:32.939> help<00:01:33.240> wait<00:01:34.170> Oh<00:01:34.350> No<00:01:34.619> draw<00:01:35.490> from<00:01:35.609> here

00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:35.819 
may need help wait Oh No draw from here

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:40.029 
may need help wait Oh No draw from here
there's<00:01:36.689> no<00:01:36.840> noise<00:01:37.310> but<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.399> works<00:01:38.579> perfectly

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
there's no noise but it works perfectly

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:45.080 
there's no noise but it works perfectly
don't<00:01:41.039> do<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.399> dirt<00:01:41.609> door<00:01:42.179> I<00:01:43.249> mean<00:01:44.249> it's<00:01:44.969> not

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
don't do the dirt door I mean it's not

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.349 
don't do the dirt door I mean it's not
really<00:01:45.359> anywhere<00:01:45.719> to<00:01:45.810> see<00:01:47.270> but<00:01:48.270> that's

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:48.359 
really anywhere to see but that's

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:57.399 
really anywhere to see but that's
awesome<00:01:49.549> the<00:01:50.549> shoot<00:01:51.140> will<00:01:52.140> be<00:01:52.259> shipped<00:01:52.560> here

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.600 

is<00:01:57.829> another<00:01:58.070> break

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
is another break

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.200 
is another break
or<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.270> like<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.780> crust

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.510 

I<00:02:04.270> think<00:02:04.479> it<00:02:04.600> what's<00:02:04.780> up

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.250 

so<00:02:08.119> it<00:02:08.450> works<00:02:08.629> on<00:02:08.920> WASD<00:02:10.150> but<00:02:11.150> that<00:02:11.300> is<00:02:11.420> also<00:02:11.629> for

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
so it works on WASD but that is also for

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.390 
so it works on WASD but that is also for
a<00:02:12.290> game<00:02:12.500> that<00:02:12.530> doesn't<00:02:12.860> actually<00:02:13.069> have<00:02:13.370> any

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
a game that doesn't actually have any

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.550 
a game that doesn't actually have any
parts<00:02:13.790> for<00:02:13.849> a<00:02:14.000> tank<00:02:14.330> it's<00:02:15.050> quite<00:02:15.290> a<00:02:15.349> lot<00:02:15.470> of

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
parts for a tank it's quite a lot of

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:23.070 
parts for a tank it's quite a lot of
detail<00:02:15.890> and<00:02:16.790> these<00:02:17.629> things<00:02:17.900> on<00:02:18.019> the<00:02:18.110> back<00:02:18.319> that

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.750 

looks<00:02:24.080> sort<00:02:24.290> of<00:02:24.319> a<00:02:24.379> Rumpy<00:02:24.890> sort<00:02:25.310> of<00:02:25.370> thing<00:02:25.580> over

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
looks sort of a Rumpy sort of thing over

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.550 
looks sort of a Rumpy sort of thing over
there<00:02:25.940> if<00:02:26.239> frumpy<00:02:26.720> was<00:02:26.840> ever<00:02:27.019> a<00:02:27.110> word<00:02:27.349> I<00:02:27.500> don't

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
there if frumpy was ever a word I don't

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.830 
there if frumpy was ever a word I don't
think<00:02:27.830> is<00:02:27.950> I<00:02:28.269> see<00:02:29.269> something<00:02:29.480> that<00:02:29.690> I<00:02:29.750> could

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
think is I see something that I could

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.759 
think is I see something that I could
jump<00:02:30.260> off<00:02:30.440> and<00:02:31.280> this<00:02:31.459> is<00:02:31.640> top<00:02:31.819> speed<00:02:32.120> so<00:02:32.769> the

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
jump off and this is top speed so the

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:34.900 
jump off and this is top speed so the
holding<00:02:34.129> out<00:02:34.250> much<00:02:34.400> hope<00:02:34.430> that<00:02:34.610> we're<00:02:34.790> going

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
holding out much hope that we're going

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.199 
holding out much hope that we're going
to<00:02:34.970> get<00:02:35.060> my<00:02:35.209> jet<00:02:35.390> seen<00:02:36.140> as<00:02:36.260> we're<00:02:36.379> an<00:02:36.440> attack

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
to get my jet seen as we're an attack
