00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
to give you a certain amount of ads so I

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.279 
to give you a certain amount of ads so I
didn't<00:00:21.390> really<00:00:21.539> know<00:00:21.630> how<00:00:21.869> this<00:00:22.020> achievement

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
didn't really know how this achievement

was<00:00:22.500> going<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.680> work<00:00:22.800> but<00:00:23.039> I<00:00:23.400> pretty<00:00:23.820> well

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
was going to work but I pretty well

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.189 
was going to work but I pretty well
guess<00:00:24.300> that<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.660> were<00:00:24.750> going<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:24.930> have<00:00:25.050> to

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
guess that you were going to have to

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.140 
guess that you were going to have to
actually<00:00:25.350> do<00:00:25.680> both<00:00:25.890> I<00:00:26.160> keep<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.609> ads<00:00:26.760> from<00:00:27.090> the

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
actually do both I keep the ads from the

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.480 
actually do both I keep the ads from the
first<00:00:27.449> ad<00:00:27.630> wave<00:00:27.840> alive<00:00:28.170> up<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.010> second<00:00:29.369> ad

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
first ad wave alive up to the second ad

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.730 
first ad wave alive up to the second ad
wave<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:29.939> was<00:00:30.210> right<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.929> have<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.140> kill<00:00:31.289> 20<00:00:31.679> of

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
wave I was right you have to kill 20 of

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.010 
wave I was right you have to kill 20 of
them<00:00:31.890> within<00:00:32.219> 10<00:00:32.460> seconds<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.090> tins<00:00:33.570> falling

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
them within 10 seconds and tins falling

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.660 
them within 10 seconds and tins falling
each<00:00:34.170> ad<00:00:34.440> wave<00:00:34.649> so<00:00:34.860> that<00:00:34.920> means<00:00:35.190> if<00:00:35.309> you<00:00:35.399> kill

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
each ad wave so that means if you kill

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.350 
each ad wave so that means if you kill
one<00:00:35.850> of<00:00:35.880> them

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
one of them

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.030 
one of them
the<00:00:36.750> achievements<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.739> have<00:00:37.920> to

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
the achievements and you have to

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.979 
the achievements and you have to
do<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.250> again<00:00:38.460> it's<00:00:39.300> kind<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.629> pain<00:00:39.780> in<00:00:39.899> the

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
do it again it's kind of a pain in the

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.930 
do it again it's kind of a pain in the
ass<00:00:40.140> but<00:00:40.500> honestly<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.160> ads<00:00:41.340> really<00:00:41.670> don't

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
ass but honestly the ads really don't

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.000 
ass but honestly the ads really don't
have<00:00:42.120> like<00:00:42.750> they<00:00:43.050> don't<00:00:43.230> have<00:00:43.379> like<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.680> lot<00:00:43.980> of

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
have like they don't have like a lot of

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.010 
have like they don't have like a lot of
health<00:00:44.340> but<00:00:44.850> they're<00:00:45.000> also<00:00:45.149> not<00:00:45.510> like<00:00:45.690> one

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
health but they're also not like one

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.690 
health but they're also not like one
Shadow<00:00:46.320> Ball<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:47.070> that's<00:00:47.250> kind<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.489> good

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
Shadow Ball and so that's kind of good

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.160 
Shadow Ball and so that's kind of good
because<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.450> obviously<00:00:48.539> don't<00:00:48.930> want<00:00:49.020> to

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
because you obviously don't want to

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.110 
because you obviously don't want to
accidentally<00:00:49.559> kill<00:00:49.800> them<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.190> also<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:50.879> want

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
accidentally kill them and also you want

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.310 
accidentally kill them and also you want
to<00:00:51.149> be<00:00:51.210> able<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.449> kill<00:00:51.600> them<00:00:51.690> easily<00:00:51.899> whenever

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
to be able to kill them easily whenever

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:52.790 
to be able to kill them easily whenever
you<00:00:52.440> need<00:00:52.649> to

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
you need to

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.830 
you need to
and<00:00:53.010> so<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.879> have<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.149> pretty<00:00:54.329> much<00:00:54.449> just<00:00:54.510> keep

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
and so you have to pretty much just keep

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.750 
and so you have to pretty much just keep
them<00:00:54.989> alive<00:00:55.230> through<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.129> through<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.520> first

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.580 
ad phase and then as soon as the second
ad<00:00:58.859> phase<00:00:59.070> happens<00:01:00.109> you<00:01:01.109> pretty<00:01:01.469> much<00:01:01.530> just

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
ad phase happens you pretty much just

ad phasing in between the first and the
second<00:01:22.619> ad<00:01:22.740> phases<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:23.790> can<00:01:24.060> get<00:01:24.240> to

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
second ad phases and so you can get to

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.469 
second ad phases and so you can get to
the<00:01:24.479> second<00:01:24.840> ad<00:01:24.990> phase<00:01:25.229> faster<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.759> ad<00:01:26.970> phases

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
the second ad phase faster the ad phases

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.359 
the second ad phase faster the ad phases
are<00:01:27.750> based<00:01:28.080> on<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.380> percentage<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.979> his<00:01:29.100> health

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
are based on a percentage of his health

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.569 
are based on a percentage of his health
and<00:01:29.810> I'm<00:01:30.810> not<00:01:30.960> really<00:01:31.140> sure<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.590> it's<00:01:32.340> not

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
and I'm not really sure and it's not

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.399 
and I'm not really sure and it's not
just<00:01:32.850> based<00:01:33.030> on<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.270> timer<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.110> can

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
just based on a timer and so you can

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.109 
just based on a timer and so you can
make<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.799> go<00:01:34.829> faster<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:35.790> if<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.000> have

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
make it go faster and so if you have

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.330 
make it go faster and so if you have
heroism<00:01:36.479> or<00:01:36.960> anything<00:01:37.439> like<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.770> you

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
heroism or anything like that you

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.580 
heroism or anything like that you
definitely<00:01:38.729> want<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:38.939> use<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.270> now<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.720> think<00:01:40.200> he

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
definitely want to use it now I think he

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.510 
definitely want to use it now I think he
transitions<00:01:41.250> at<00:01:41.369> about<00:01:41.549> 40%<00:01:42.060> or<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.520> as

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
transitions at about 40% or so and as

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.010 
transitions at about 40% or so and as
you<00:01:44.640> can<00:01:44.729> see<00:01:44.970> like<00:01:45.180> our<00:01:45.360> tank<00:01:45.570> isn't<00:01:45.780> really

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
you can see like our tank isn't really

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.929 
you can see like our tank isn't really
taking<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.380> whole<00:01:46.530> lot<00:01:46.619> of<00:01:46.740> extra<00:01:47.040> damage<00:01:47.220> the

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
taking a whole lot of extra damage the

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.999 
taking a whole lot of extra damage the
ads<00:01:48.090> don't<00:01:48.329> really<00:01:48.600> do<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:48.930> much<00:01:49.079> damage<00:01:49.140> and

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
ads don't really do that much damage and

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.069 
ads don't really do that much damage and
also<00:01:50.369> as<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.579> paladin<00:01:51.030> who<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.270> think<00:01:51.780> this<00:01:51.930> guy

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
also as a paladin who I think this guy

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.350 
also as a paladin who I think this guy
is<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.290> paladin<00:01:52.799> actually<00:01:53.759> can<00:01:53.909> help<00:01:54.030> him<00:01:54.270> out

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
is a paladin actually can help him out

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.300 
is a paladin actually can help him out
because<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.899> will<00:01:54.990> give<00:01:55.079> them<00:01:55.170> more<00:01:55.409> more<00:01:56.100> holy

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
because it will give them more more holy

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.030 
because it will give them more more holy
power<00:01:56.640> as<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:57.570> can<00:01:57.719> see<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:57.990> flying<00:01:58.409> away<00:01:58.590> and

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
power as you can see is flying away and

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.560 
power as you can see is flying away and
the<00:01:59.189> more<00:01:59.369> ads<00:01:59.520> are<00:01:59.670> coming<00:01:59.939> in<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.270> so<00:02:00.390> we're

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
the more ads are coming in and so we're

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.730 
the more ads are coming in and so we're
kind<00:02:00.719> of<00:02:00.750> waiting<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.020> get<00:02:01.200> them<00:02:01.320> all<00:02:01.439> stacked

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
kind of waiting to get them all stacked

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.380 
kind of waiting to get them all stacked
up<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.520> also<00:02:02.670> don't<00:02:02.880> want<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.119> get<00:02:03.240> your

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
up and you also don't want to get your

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.480 
up and you also don't want to get your
first<00:02:03.630> set<00:02:03.899> very<00:02:04.140> well<00:02:04.409> because<00:02:05.130> then<00:02:05.340> you're

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
first set very well because then you're

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.649 
first set very well because then you're
going<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.640> have<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.939> kill<00:02:06.119> them<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.299> lot<00:02:06.420> faster

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
going to have to kill them a lot faster

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.719 
going to have to kill them a lot faster
and<00:02:06.930> you<00:02:07.560> know<00:02:07.710> obviously<00:02:07.920> will<00:02:08.340> lead<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.700> a

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
and you know obviously will lead to a

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.669 
and you know obviously will lead to a
problem<00:02:09.030> as<00:02:09.360> you<00:02:09.660> see<00:02:09.989> I'm<00:02:10.170> tracking<00:02:10.410> the

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
problem as you see I'm tracking the

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.710 
problem as you see I'm tracking the
achievement<00:02:11.160> and<00:02:11.340> it's<00:02:11.459> counting<00:02:11.849> down<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.629> I

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
achievement and it's counting down and I

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.820 
achievement and it's counting down and I
think<00:02:12.989> we<00:02:13.080> get<00:02:13.200> it<00:02:13.319> done<00:02:13.500> with

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
think we get it done with

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.220 
think we get it done with
pretty<00:02:14.040> yeah<00:02:14.280> we<00:02:14.670> got<00:02:14.820> done<00:02:15.090> no<00:02:15.420> no<00:02:15.750> problem

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
pretty yeah we got done no no problem

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.860 
pretty yeah we got done no no problem
and<00:02:16.410> as<00:02:17.130> you<00:02:17.250> can<00:02:17.370> see<00:02:17.610> here<00:02:17.850> also<00:02:18.030> at<00:02:18.690> least

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
and as you can see here also at least

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.360 
and as you can see here also at least
right<00:02:19.080> now<00:02:19.110> you<00:02:19.290> don't<00:02:19.650> really<00:02:19.770> have<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.160> kill

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
right now you don't really have to kill

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.920 
right now you don't really have to kill
the<00:02:20.520> boss<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.970> actually<00:02:21.210> get<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.480> achievement

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
the boss to actually get the achievement

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.690 
the boss to actually get the achievement
I<00:02:22.080> don't<00:02:22.740> know<00:02:22.800> if<00:02:22.920> that<00:02:23.070> will<00:02:23.130> change<00:02:23.370> or<00:02:23.580> not

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
I don't know if that will change or not

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.790 
I don't know if that will change or not
but<00:02:24.090> if<00:02:24.390> it<00:02:24.540> does<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:24.990> only<00:02:25.230> you<00:02:25.380> guys<00:02:25.500> know

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
but if it does and only you guys know

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.640 
but if it does and only you guys know
but<00:02:26.460> until<00:02:27.150> then<00:02:27.390> it's<00:02:27.600> really<00:02:27.810> really<00:02:28.410> not<00:02:28.590> a

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
but until then it's really really not a

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.410 
but until then it's really really not a
big<00:02:28.920> deal<00:02:29.130> because<00:02:29.340> you<00:02:29.790> can<00:02:29.970> just<00:02:30.120> use<00:02:30.270> all

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
big deal because you can just use all

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.910 
big deal because you can just use all
your<00:02:30.570> cooldowns<00:02:30.900> kill<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.380> ads<00:02:31.530> get<00:02:31.800> the

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
your cooldowns kill the ads get the

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.410 
your cooldowns kill the ads get the
achievement<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.430> wipe<00:02:32.550> the<00:02:32.760> instance<00:02:33.210> or

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
achievement and wipe the instance or

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.660 
achievement and wipe the instance or
wipe<00:02:33.810> you<00:02:33.960> have<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:34.290> wipe<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.070> boss<00:02:35.220> and<00:02:35.460> do<00:02:35.580> it

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
wipe you have to wipe the boss and do it

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.970 
wipe you have to wipe the boss and do it
again<00:02:35.850> normally<00:02:36.300> if<00:02:36.900> you<00:02:37.050> really<00:02:37.290> have<00:02:37.500> to<00:02:37.710> but

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
again normally if you really have to but

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.350 
again normally if you really have to but
I'm<00:02:38.460> not<00:02:38.670> really<00:02:38.820> expecting<00:02:39.030> this

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
I'm not really expecting this

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.700 
I'm not really expecting this
achievement<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:39.870> be<00:02:39.960> very<00:02:40.170> difficult<00:02:40.350> for

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
achievement to be very difficult for

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.350 
achievement to be very difficult for
anyone<00:02:40.920> as<00:02:41.280> long<00:02:41.340> as<00:02:41.670> you<00:02:41.790> have<00:02:41.910> a<00:02:41.940> good<00:02:42.150> group

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
anyone as long as you have a good group

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.120 
anyone as long as you have a good group
it<00:02:42.720> took<00:02:42.930> us<00:02:43.050> a<00:02:43.170> few<00:02:43.320> tries<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.740> get<00:02:43.860> it<00:02:43.980> down

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
it took us a few tries to get it down

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.040 
it took us a few tries to get it down
mostly<00:02:44.580> just<00:02:44.790> figuring<00:02:45.180> out<00:02:45.270> what<00:02:45.540> to<00:02:45.690> do<00:02:45.810> and

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
mostly just figuring out what to do and

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.870
