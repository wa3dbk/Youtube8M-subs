00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
cornerback but you know it's easier than

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.170 
cornerback but you know it's easier than
being<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.110> safety<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.680> love<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.220> love<00:01:08.250> both<00:01:08.640> being

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
just because you only have to worry

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.600 
just because you only have to worry
about<00:01:15.000> one<00:01:15.270> guy<00:01:15.450> most<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:15.990> time<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.610> free

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
that I hate when it does the animation

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.350 
that I hate when it does the animation
that<00:02:45.160> you're<00:02:45.250> gonna<00:02:45.340> intercept<00:02:45.910> it<00:02:46.060> and<00:02:46.210> then

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
that you're gonna intercept it and then

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.449 
that you're gonna intercept it and then
you<00:02:46.630> don't<00:02:46.870> come<00:02:47.020> up<00:02:47.140> with<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.290> ball<00:02:47.530> and<00:02:47.800> I

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459

where<00:02:50.890> me<00:02:51.310> and<00:02:51.520> Greg<00:02:51.850> King<00:02:52.060> did<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.810> same

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
where me and Greg King did the same

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.250 
where me and Greg King did the same
exact<00:02:53.730> animation<00:02:54.730> to<00:02:54.970> catch<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.360> ball<00:02:55.540> it

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
exact animation to catch the ball it

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.480 
exact animation to catch the ball it
happens<00:02:56.530> a<00:02:56.620> lot<00:02:56.770> whenever<00:02:57.040> someone<00:02:57.459> gets

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
happens a lot whenever someone gets

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.600 
happens a lot whenever someone gets
tripped<00:02:58.150> or<00:02:58.300> something<00:02:58.660> they<00:02:59.250> do<00:03:00.250> the<00:03:00.400> same

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
tripped or something they do the same

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.070 
tripped or something they do the same
animation<00:03:01.030> right<00:03:01.360> next<00:03:01.570> to<00:03:01.660> each<00:03:01.720> other<00:03:01.870> and

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
animation right next to each other and

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.930 
animation right next to each other and
it<00:03:02.170> looks<00:03:02.380> so<00:03:02.620> unrealistic<00:03:03.130> but<00:03:03.550> I<00:03:03.610> mean<00:03:03.790> I

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
it looks so unrealistic but I mean I

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.210 
it looks so unrealistic but I mean I
can't<00:03:04.660> beggars<00:03:05.350> can't<00:03:05.530> be<00:03:05.560> choosers<00:03:05.950> I<00:03:06.070> don't

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
can't beggars can't be choosers I don't

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.340 
can't beggars can't be choosers I don't
know<00:03:06.310> i<00:03:06.490> don't<00:03:06.610> i<00:03:06.970> really<00:03:07.300> don't<00:03:07.480> know<00:03:07.540> but<00:03:08.140> you

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
know i don't i really don't know but you

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.380 
know i don't i really don't know but you
kind<00:03:08.530> of<00:03:08.590> just<00:03:08.740> go<00:03:09.010> with<00:03:09.280> whatever<00:03:09.910> madden

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
kind of just go with whatever madden

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.960 
kind of just go with whatever madden
throws<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:10.840> same<00:03:11.230> animations<00:03:11.800> the<00:03:12.640> tackling

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
throws the same animations the tackling

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.360 
throws the same animations the tackling
system<00:03:13.330> is<00:03:13.480> different<00:03:13.690> this<00:03:13.959> year<00:03:14.100> but<00:03:15.100> the

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
system is different this year but the

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.860 
system is different this year but the
animation<00:03:15.940> there's<00:03:16.090> a<00:03:16.150> lot<00:03:16.450> of<00:03:16.480> the<00:03:16.690> same

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
animation there's a lot of the same

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.420 
animation there's a lot of the same
animations<00:03:17.440> that's<00:03:17.590> been<00:03:17.769> in<00:03:17.980> this<00:03:18.190> game<00:03:18.280> for

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
animations that's been in this game for

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.570 
animations that's been in this game for
years<00:03:18.670> so<00:03:19.420> i<00:03:19.720> don't<00:03:19.930> really<00:03:20.050> expect<00:03:20.410> a<00:03:20.709> lot<00:03:21.430> of

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
years so i don't really expect a lot of

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.180 
years so i don't really expect a lot of
change<00:03:21.790> every<00:03:22.060> year<00:03:22.709> right<00:03:23.709> there<00:03:23.890> I<00:03:23.920> was<00:03:24.100> like

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
change every year right there I was like

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.620 
change every year right there I was like
