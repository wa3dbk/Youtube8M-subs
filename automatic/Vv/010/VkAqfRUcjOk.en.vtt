I'm speaking around mid-december 2013
it<00:01:10.770> may<00:01:11.159> actually<00:01:11.369> pull<00:01:11.820> in<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.210> lot<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.450> blank

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
it may actually pull in a lot of blank

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.200 
it may actually pull in a lot of blank
channels<00:01:13.290> as<00:01:13.530> well<00:01:13.770> because<00:01:14.220> they<00:01:14.520> they<00:01:14.970> serve

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210

moment is working off a to multiplex

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.990 
moment is working off a to multiplex
system<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:21.799> this<00:01:22.799> is<00:01:22.950> just<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.340> byproduct<00:01:23.700> of

another video we'll show in this series

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.749 
another video we'll show in this series
will<00:01:34.590> show<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.890> how<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.040> can<00:01:35.220> start<00:01:35.460> until

will show you how you can start until

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.330 
will show you how you can start until
each<00:01:35.909> channels<00:01:36.420> so<00:01:36.930> basically<00:01:37.380> one<00:01:37.860> shot<00:01:38.070> once

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
each channels so basically one shot once

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.100 
each channels so basically one shot once
they're<00:01:38.520> all<00:01:38.640> scanned<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.210> what<00:01:39.840> you'll<00:01:39.990> want

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
they're all scanned in what you'll want

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.600 
they're all scanned in what you'll want
to<00:01:40.229> do<00:01:40.409> is<00:01:40.590> go<00:01:40.740> through<00:01:40.770> them<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.250> see<00:01:41.310> which

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
to do is go through them and see which

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.219 
to do is go through them and see which
ones<00:01:41.820> have<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.060> best<00:01:42.329> signal<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:42.869> stuff<00:01:43.049> like

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
ones have the best signal and stuff like

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.590 
ones have the best signal and stuff like
that<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.500> only<00:01:43.740> keep<00:01:43.920> them<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.670> that's

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
that and only keep them and that's

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.969 
that and only keep them and that's
basically<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.200> you're<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.649> plaintiff

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
should note that on this particular box

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.359 
should note that on this particular box
unlike<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.840> lot<00:01:49.079> of<00:01:49.200> boxes<00:01:49.530> we've<00:01:49.680> seen<00:01:49.890> it

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
unlike a lot of boxes we've seen it

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.330 
unlike a lot of boxes we've seen it
actually<00:01:50.880> pulls<00:01:51.180> in<00:01:51.390> all<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:52.590> Irish<00:01:52.710> channels

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
in one scan there's no there's no such

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.980 
in one scan there's no there's no such
thing<00:01:56.549> as<00:01:56.759> basically<00:01:57.240> scanning<00:01:57.600> once<00:01:57.750> during

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
thing as basically scanning once during

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.840 
thing as basically scanning once during
the<00:01:58.170> day<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.350> get<00:01:58.560> our<00:01:58.710> RTE<00:01:59.130> Junior<00:01:59.549> and<00:01:59.700> once

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
in the evening to get our te plus one it

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.440 
in the evening to get our te plus one it
pulls<00:02:02.159> them<00:02:02.340> all<00:02:02.430> in<00:02:02.640> at<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.790> same<00:02:03.000> time<00:02:03.060> which

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
pulls them all in at the same time which

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.899 
pulls them all in at the same time which
is<00:02:03.600> very<00:02:03.630> advantageous<00:02:04.130> so<00:02:05.130> that's<00:02:05.520> basically

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
is very advantageous so that's basically

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.789 
is very advantageous so that's basically
how<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.240> can<00:02:06.390> perform<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:07.020> scan<00:02:07.320> for<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.619> serve

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
how you can perform a scan for the serve

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.760 
how you can perform a scan for the serve
your<00:02:07.979> channels<00:02:08.340> on<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.940> TV<00:02:09.239> star<00:02:09.599> ts<00:02:10.050> 4000
