00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
you like standing in front the part line

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.880 
you like standing in front the part line
in<00:02:14.049> the<00:02:14.110> second<00:02:14.440> half<00:02:15.989> yeah<00:02:16.989> if<00:02:17.049> I'm<00:02:17.230> cuts<00:02:17.709> and

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
in the second half yeah if I'm cuts and

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.380 
in the second half yeah if I'm cuts and
I<00:02:17.920> like<00:02:18.069> 20<00:02:18.280> their<00:02:18.519> second<00:02:18.819> half<00:02:18.970> but<00:02:19.180> there's

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
I like 20 their second half but there's

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.850 
I like 20 their second half but there's
more<00:02:19.480> pressure<00:02:19.660> on<00:02:19.870> except<00:02:20.260> over<00:02:20.470> clean<00:02:20.680> sheet

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
more pressure on except over clean sheet

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.050 
more pressure on except over clean sheet
or<00:02:20.980> else<00:02:21.099> they<00:02:21.190> don't<00:02:21.340> sing<00:02:21.519> my<00:02:21.610> name<00:02:21.760> is<00:02:21.910> loud

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
or else they don't sing my name is loud

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.710 
or else they don't sing my name is loud
I<00:02:23.849> don't<00:02:24.849> think<00:02:24.879> I<00:02:25.030> think<00:02:25.360> it's<00:02:25.450> just<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.599> way

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
I don't think I think it's just the way

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.850 
I don't think I think it's just the way
that<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:25.930> club's<00:02:26.140> played<00:02:26.349> for<00:02:26.500> a<00:02:26.530> long<00:02:26.560> time

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
that the club's played for a long time

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.800 
that the club's played for a long time
there's<00:02:27.580> no<00:02:27.670> particular<00:02:27.849> reason<00:02:28.299> for<00:02:28.450> it<00:02:28.690> I

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
there's no particular reason for it I

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:29.940 
there's no particular reason for it I
mean<00:02:28.930> if<00:02:29.079> we<00:02:29.170> if<00:02:29.319> we're<00:02:29.470> winning<00:02:29.709> and<00:02:29.829> doing

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
mean if we if we're winning and doing

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.860 
mean if we if we're winning and doing
well<00:02:30.160> I<00:02:30.730> think<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.450> only<00:02:31.480> team<00:02:31.780> that's

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
well I think the only team that's

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.800 
well I think the only team that's
beating<00:02:32.110> us<00:02:32.260> here<00:02:32.380> for<00:02:32.560> a<00:02:32.590> while<00:02:32.739> as<00:02:32.799> Chelsea

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
beating us here for a while as Chelsea

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.940 
beating us here for a while as Chelsea
and<00:02:34.810> we<00:02:34.959> seem<00:02:35.170> to<00:02:35.260> be<00:02:35.290> winning<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:35.680> doing<00:02:35.769> all

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
and we seem to be winning and doing all

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.289 
and we seem to be winning and doing all
right<00:02:35.980> you<00:02:36.160> know<00:02:36.250> we<00:02:36.340> don't<00:02:36.459> change<00:02:36.790> it<00:02:36.970> join

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
right you know we don't change it join

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.630 
right you know we don't change it join
change<00:02:37.569> what's<00:02:37.780> working<00:02:38.190> one<00:02:39.190> thing<00:02:39.430> that<00:02:39.459> has

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
change what's working one thing that has

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.339 
change what's working one thing that has
been<00:02:39.670> discussed<00:02:40.239> quite<00:02:40.510> a<00:02:40.630> lot<00:02:40.989> there's<00:02:41.290> a

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
been discussed quite a lot there's a

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:45.150 
been discussed quite a lot there's a
theory<00:02:41.829> that<00:02:42.329> whilst<00:02:43.470> you<00:02:44.470> were<00:02:44.590> commended<00:02:45.040> in

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
theory that whilst you were commended in

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.860 
theory that whilst you were commended in
quite<00:02:45.370> rightly<00:02:45.670> for<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.090> way<00:02:46.209> you<00:02:46.269> handled

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
quite rightly for the way you handled

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
quite rightly for the way you handled
the<00:02:47.019> Old<00:02:47.170> Trafford<00:02:47.349> incident<00:02:48.099> and<00:02:49.799> you<00:02:50.799> know

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
the Old Trafford incident and you know

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.890 
the Old Trafford incident and you know
the<00:02:51.040> other<00:02:51.130> night<00:02:51.250> at<00:02:51.579> Bolton<00:02:52.120> we<00:02:52.750> were

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
the other night at Bolton we were

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.170 
the other night at Bolton we were
cheated<00:02:53.319> really<00:02:53.680> because<00:02:54.040> Jemaine<00:02:54.610> scored<00:02:55.030> a

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
cheated really because Jemaine scored a

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.080 
cheated really because Jemaine scored a
legal<00:02:55.900> go<00:02:56.049> there<00:02:56.950> is<00:02:57.040> a<00:02:57.069> theory<00:02:57.579> that<00:02:57.610> whilst

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
legal go there is a theory that whilst

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.770 
legal go there is a theory that whilst
it's<00:02:58.420> wonderful<00:02:58.989> to<00:02:59.019> be<00:03:00.239> very<00:03:01.239> decent<00:03:01.720> about

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
it's wonderful to be very decent about

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.569 
it's wonderful to be very decent about
accepting<00:03:02.440> these<00:03:02.560> decisions<00:03:02.920> that<00:03:03.310> if<00:03:03.430> you

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
accepting these decisions that if you

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:06.840 
accepting these decisions that if you
get<00:03:03.760> a<00:03:03.790> little<00:03:04.000> nastier<00:03:04.829> on<00:03:05.829> our<00:03:06.040> Ferguson<00:03:06.670> for

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
get a little nastier on our Ferguson for

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.390 
get a little nastier on our Ferguson for
example<00:03:07.450> then<00:03:08.139> sometimes<00:03:08.859> the<00:03:09.040> fish<00:03:09.220> will

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
example then sometimes the fish will

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.160 
example then sometimes the fish will
start<00:03:09.670> leaning<00:03:09.910> a<00:03:10.209> little<00:03:10.239> bit<00:03:10.540> more<00:03:10.720> our<00:03:10.959> way

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
start leaning a little bit more our way

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.069 
start leaning a little bit more our way
