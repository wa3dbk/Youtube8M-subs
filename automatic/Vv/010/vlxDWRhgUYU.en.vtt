00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:56.570 
last shampoos time to look really quite

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.670 
last shampoos time to look really quite
faded<00:05:56.870> now<00:05:57.640> but<00:05:58.640> after<00:05:59.170> what<00:06:00.170> was<00:06:00.260> it<00:06:00.410> 20

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 
faded now but after what was it 20

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.770 
faded now but after what was it 20
minutes<00:06:00.830> I<00:06:01.070> think<00:06:01.250> I've<00:06:01.340> got<00:06:01.460> it<00:06:01.490> on<00:06:01.640> four<00:06:01.910> and

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:02.780 
minutes I think I've got it on four and

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.020 
minutes I think I've got it on four and
I've<00:06:02.960> done<00:06:03.200> it<00:06:03.410> now<00:06:03.920> bobby<00:06:04.460> was<00:06:04.640> about<00:06:04.790> a<00:06:04.820> month

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:05.030 
I've done it now bobby was about a month

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:05.920 
I've done it now bobby was about a month
ago<00:06:05.210> I<00:06:05.360> did<00:06:05.660> it

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:05.930 
ago I did it

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.330 
ago I did it
I<00:06:05.960> think<00:06:06.470> that's<00:06:06.590> lasting<00:06:06.920> really<00:06:07.100> well<00:06:07.190> and

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:07.340 
I think that's lasting really well and

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.730 
I think that's lasting really well and
if<00:06:07.430> you<00:06:07.550> like<00:06:07.700> a<00:06:07.730> real<00:06:08.030> pearl<00:06:08.240> lavender<00:06:08.810> this

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
if you like a real pearl lavender this

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.500 
if you like a real pearl lavender this
is<00:06:09.920> your<00:06:10.100> color<00:06:10.250> okay<00:06:10.700> it's<00:06:10.940> quite<00:06:11.120> strong<00:06:11.330> at

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:11.510 
is your color okay it's quite strong at

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.230 
is your color okay it's quite strong at
first<00:06:11.540> but<00:06:12.050> as<00:06:12.200> I<00:06:12.320> said<00:06:12.380> earlier<00:06:12.830> just<00:06:13.240> make

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 
first but as I said earlier just make

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.120 
first but as I said earlier just make
some<00:06:14.390> conditioner<00:06:14.900> in<00:06:15.110> with<00:06:15.320> it<00:06:15.470> just<00:06:15.950> add

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.130 
some conditioner in with it just add

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.030 
some conditioner in with it just add
like<00:06:16.250> a<00:06:16.310> tiny<00:06:16.520> spoonful<00:06:17.090> of<00:06:17.120> the<00:06:17.330> violet<00:06:17.750> um

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:18.040 
like a tiny spoonful of the violet um

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:22.450 
like a tiny spoonful of the violet um
and<00:06:19.040> the<00:06:19.760> violet<00:06:20.090> directions<00:06:20.690> I<00:06:20.810> think<00:06:21.740> whoops

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.460 
and the violet directions I think whoops

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.130 
and the violet directions I think whoops
your<00:06:22.670> uncle<00:06:23.000> Fanny's<00:06:23.480> your<00:06:23.600> aunt<00:06:23.660> that's<00:06:23.960> it

that I can't remember how many shampoos
now<00:06:27.950> I<00:06:27.980> think<00:06:28.160> that's<00:06:28.280> probably<00:06:28.370> about<00:06:28.610> eight
