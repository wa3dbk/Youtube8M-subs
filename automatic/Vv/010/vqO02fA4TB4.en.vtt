00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.880 
we gotta fix one is the wing spar is a
little<00:05:41.670> wobbly<00:05:41.850> so<00:05:42.390> we<00:05:43.080> need<00:05:43.200> to<00:05:43.320> thicken<00:05:43.710> it

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:43.890 
little wobbly so we need to thicken it

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:45.410 
little wobbly so we need to thicken it
up<00:05:44.010> and<00:05:44.460> maybe<00:05:44.670> a<00:05:44.760> little<00:05:44.880> other<00:05:45.060> mounting

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:45.420 
up and maybe a little other mounting

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.120 
up and maybe a little other mounting
thing<00:05:45.630> some<00:05:45.870> epoxy<00:05:46.170> on<00:05:46.380> the<00:05:46.590> spar<00:05:46.860> to<00:05:46.980> make

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
thing some epoxy on the spar to make

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.340 
thing some epoxy on the spar to make
sure<00:05:47.250> it's<00:05:47.400> in<00:05:47.490> the<00:05:47.610> fuselage<00:05:48.030> more<00:05:48.570> solid<00:05:49.200> and

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:49.350 
sure it's in the fuselage more solid and

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.440 
sure it's in the fuselage more solid and
I'd<00:05:50.190> say<00:05:50.430> we<00:05:50.520> got<00:05:50.550> a<00:05:50.700> fully<00:05:50.970> functional

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.450 
I'd say we got a fully functional

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.110 
I'd say we got a fully functional
airplane<00:05:51.750> right<00:05:51.900> here
