 quick start guide a few 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.670
 Information is not earth-shattering 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:47.989
 then basically a phone as now 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.920
 almost by itself 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.289
 well and here it is the samsung galaxy s 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.230

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:59.420
 we have a 4.3 inch hd super here 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:04.210
 amoled display with a resolution of 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.210

 the phone itself has 8 gb internal 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.580
 Storage

 micro sd memory card up to 64 gb 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.920
 upgrade or expand by 64gb 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.619
 I will show you this shortly before we 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.610
 luckily, just come by yourself 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:29.479
 opened so the back consists of 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:34.100
 a plastic plate of the battery itself 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:35.270
 has 1900 milliamps and here 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.640
 we have the possibility, so to speak 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.869
 insert our micro sd card 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:44.420
 and here's the micro-sim on the back 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.840
 synonymous is an 8 megapixel camera here 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:52.330
 with a led photo light 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:54.470
 on the top itself we have in 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:58.160
 three and a half millimeter jack connection 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.660
 then have for headphones and microphone 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.450
 Here we have an infrared interface 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.460
 to transfer sales eg to use 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.000
 on the right is one 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.000
 off switch 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.420
 otherwise we are on the right 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.819
 Nothing on the bottom of the page 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.910
 her the micro usb connection as well as the 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.769
 microphone and on the left side 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.170
 we quite normal the volume vitte on 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:25.459
 the front is then down here 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.620
 two sensor keys and hold completely 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:32.420
 main menu button and at the top has 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:36.030
 the front camera is 10 megapixels 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:40.110
 and exactly the speaker so there it is 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:46.110
 Again the phone has 15 gigabytes 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:52.430
 Memory and is in android 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:58.459
 version 4.2 point 2 to you there you see 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:03:02.040
 camp and 2.2 it weighs 107 grams has nfc 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:05.310
 lte umts is equipped with everything what 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.170
 you have to have these days and really 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.920
 Quite no, let's say in comparison 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.519
 to keep 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.400
 I have a nexus 4 of the size here 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:16.079
 here 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.579
 Of course it was much smaller 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:23.389
 but that's just how you see it 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:25.410
 Comparison of size 43 inches to 4.7 displayName 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:27.810
 that makes a lot of it 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.019
 Above all , that looks pretty good in the 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.560
 hand and can be very good 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.660
 serve 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.670
 Of course I want you one more 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.010
 Show a bit on the internet say how 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.709
 quickly the browser opens to it 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.890
 I just open a short bottom 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.580
 from the shop 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.580
 then have to 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:56.269
 That's the mobile shop now 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:59.500
 view can make us of course the 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.500
 Show desktop version 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.360
 and then you see the sit here 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.460
 desktop watch sum short and ran it 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.570
 no jerking anything else it runs 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:13.160
 really super stable super liquid 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:15.980
 no problems surfing 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.900
 I've had dogs, that's almost it 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.130
 again as we still have these here 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.930
 typical samsung touchwiz surface 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.210
 with the smart save function 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.980
 Basically, only the mobile phone recognizes 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.070
 with the integrated camera 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.930
 your face your eyes and the display 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.650
 turns off, so to speak, only 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:39.650
 if you look at it not just as 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:44.620
 much to the galaxy s four mini i hope so 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.620
 I like you and see you next time
