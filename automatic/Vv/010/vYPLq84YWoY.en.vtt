you'll<00:02:16.890> find<00:02:17.190> it<00:02:17.340> very<00:02:17.370> powerful<00:02:18.060> and

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
you'll find it very powerful and

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.120 
you'll find it very powerful and
sometimes<00:02:18.630> it<00:02:18.810> won't<00:02:19.050> be<00:02:19.140> powerful<00:02:19.560> by<00:02:19.680> put<00:02:20.040> it

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
sometimes it won't be powerful by put it

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.340 
sometimes it won't be powerful by put it
down<00:02:20.340> as<00:02:20.490> decent<00:02:21.090> because<00:02:21.330> most<00:02:21.960> of<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.110> time

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
down as decent because most of the time

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.980 
down as decent because most of the time
is<00:02:22.560> decent<00:02:23.430> he's<00:02:24.120> very<00:02:24.210> effective<00:02:24.720> when

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
is decent he's very effective when

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
is decent he's very effective when
you're<00:02:25.110> running<00:02:25.290> straight<00:02:25.620> like<00:02:25.800> I<00:02:25.890> was

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
you're running straight like I was

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.830 
you're running straight like I was
saying<00:02:26.220> before<00:02:26.340> positioning<00:02:27.150> is<00:02:27.270> good<00:02:27.480> cheap

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
saying before positioning is good cheap

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.860 
saying before positioning is good cheap
and<00:02:28.170> finish<00:02:28.980> shorts<00:02:29.280> are<00:02:29.430> ok<00:02:29.460> as<00:02:30.030> well<00:02:30.240> as<00:02:30.510> same

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
and finish shorts are ok as well as same

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.390 
and finish shorts are ok as well as same
as<00:02:30.900> shooting<00:02:31.200> something<00:02:31.740> they're<00:02:31.980> really

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
as shooting something they're really

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.790 
as shooting something they're really
inconsistent<00:02:32.880> but<00:02:33.420> most<00:02:33.690> of<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.930> time<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.470> is

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
inconsistent but most of the time it is

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.070 
inconsistent but most of the time it is
good<00:02:35.340> so<00:02:35.790> keep<00:02:36.210> that<00:02:36.240> in<00:02:36.420> mind<00:02:36.630> guys<00:02:36.780> now<00:02:37.020> the

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
good so keep that in mind guys now the

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.949 
good so keep that in mind guys now the
only<00:02:37.490> really<00:02:38.490> inconsistent<00:02:38.880> thing<00:02:39.420> about<00:02:39.660> him

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
only really inconsistent thing about him

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.590 
only really inconsistent thing about him
is<00:02:39.990> his<00:02:40.440> dribbling<00:02:41.070> so<00:02:41.430> his<00:02:41.850> book<00:02:42.150> control<00:02:42.480> was

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
is his dribbling so his book control was

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.720 
is his dribbling so his book control was
good<00:02:42.840> his<00:02:43.440> first<00:02:43.740> touch<00:02:43.950> i<00:02:44.130> really<00:02:44.400> liked<00:02:44.550> as

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
good his first touch i really liked as

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.540 
good his first touch i really liked as
well<00:02:44.910> but<00:02:45.090> his<00:02:45.270> dribbling<00:02:45.840> can<00:02:46.740> be<00:02:46.950> a<00:02:46.980> bit<00:02:47.280> on

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
well but his dribbling can be a bit on

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.699 
well but his dribbling can be a bit on
the<00:02:47.790> stiff<00:02:48.030> side<00:02:48.060> i'm<00:02:48.540> not<00:02:48.720> too<00:02:48.870> sure<00:02:48.900> why<00:02:49.320> even

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
the stiff side i'm not too sure why even

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.070 
the stiff side i'm not too sure why even
though<00:02:49.830> his<00:02:49.980> agility<00:02:50.400> is<00:02:50.790> quite<00:02:51.090> high<00:02:51.360> maybe

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
though his agility is quite high maybe

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.990 
though his agility is quite high maybe
it<00:02:52.320> is<00:02:52.440> because<00:02:52.620> of<00:02:52.770> how<00:02:53.010> tall<00:02:53.070> he<00:02:53.550> is<00:02:53.580> but<00:02:53.880> then

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
it is because of how tall he is but then

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.510 
it is because of how tall he is but then
again<00:02:54.150> look<00:02:54.390> at<00:02:54.510> fucking<00:02:54.840> Ibrahimovic<00:02:55.530> but<00:02:56.280> i

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
again look at fucking Ibrahimovic but i

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.490 
again look at fucking Ibrahimovic but i
don't<00:02:56.760> know<00:02:56.880> something<00:02:57.330> about<00:02:57.630> his<00:02:58.020> dribbling

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
don't know something about his dribbling

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.620 
don't know something about his dribbling
sometimes<00:02:59.040> make<00:02:59.340> him<00:02:59.520> feel<00:02:59.700> stiff<00:03:00.090> but

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
sometimes make him feel stiff but

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.600 
sometimes make him feel stiff but
sometimes<00:03:01.140> he<00:03:01.380> can<00:03:01.530> dribble<00:03:01.770> very<00:03:02.100> easily<00:03:02.340> so

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
sometimes he can dribble very easily so

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.070 
sometimes he can dribble very easily so
keep<00:03:03.000> that<00:03:03.180> mind<00:03:03.420> up<00:03:03.540> put<00:03:03.720> it<00:03:03.810> as<00:03:03.930> an

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
keep that mind up put it as an

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.140 
keep that mind up put it as an
inconsistent<00:03:04.650> attribute<00:03:05.340> rather<00:03:05.850> than<00:03:06.090> a

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
inconsistent attribute rather than a

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.120 
inconsistent attribute rather than a
negative<00:03:06.750> this<00:03:06.930> guy<00:03:07.080> doesn't<00:03:07.410> basically<00:03:07.680> have

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
negative this guy doesn't basically have

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.910 
negative this guy doesn't basically have
any<00:03:08.400> any<00:03:09.090> negative<00:03:09.570> so<00:03:09.870> keep<00:03:10.440> that<00:03:10.470> in<00:03:10.620> mind

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
any any negative so keep that in mind
