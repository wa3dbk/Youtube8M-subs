00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.100
 we will demonstrate polishing without 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.020
 glass cover on the engine case 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.560
 to better visualize 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.840
 first we must polish using the cone of 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:28.100
 felt that will give the polish in the part 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:31.059
 internal of the rings pass in the cone the paste 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.470
 of polishing in rod which is thicker 

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:35.020
 insert the ring and it rotates in 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.210
 opposite way 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:41.750
 do this with all the rings except 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.150
 of the alliances we will show below the 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.980
 why this 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.710
 after passing all the parts in the cone 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:52.610
 trotting through the horse's brush and 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.890
 again the polishing paste now passes the 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.830
 outside the rings on the brush with 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:01.940
 move the piece of 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:04.250
 Replace all parts in this 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.940
 brush and go putting polishing paste 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.670
 Whenever you change you think to polish 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.540
 replace the brush with the 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.810
 fits alliance in filter cone 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:20.509
 bring the brush cone closer 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:24.200
 see that the brush itself forces alliance 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:27.109
 rotating polishing the inside and the outside 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:31.189
 fact that it does not have stone makes 

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:34.219
 easier operation to show 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:37.240
 use the white jean brush and the 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:39.979
 polishing with thinner granulation 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.020
 this is the step that gives the brightness 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.420
 characteristic of the jewels we find 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.490
 in shops 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.289
 after all the parts are polluted 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.380
 we must clean them to remove the 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:54.170
 Polishing paste wastes prepare the 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.649
 cleaning solution with ammonia water and 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.829
 as we have already shown put all the 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.270
 parts within this solution 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:05.859
 warm the bottom of the container with 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.859
 until it boils
