 kindness the purse and the joy and the good 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.860
 mood is the sequence of 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.300
 funny stories and it's mostly the 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.590
 radio of all sports since we talk 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.770

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.420
 our Teutonic friends here they are listening to us 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.489
 maybe I do not know why 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.289

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.909
 platini at the time who had celebrated his 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:41.409
 goal then except we do not know at last 

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:43.179

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:43.769

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:45.909

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:47.530
 gentlemen the fans frankly if 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:48.850
 you could wait until the end of the match 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.979
 to be sad and to mourn you 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.239

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.440
 wait an hour and a half and after 

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:02.139
 you cried but here it is a veiling a 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.150
 little patient sees there a logic he has a 

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:06.850
 kind of logic yesterday drinks from the little 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.640
 milk did it make sense in star 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.710
 comes if every thirty years he's us 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.880
 make a nice statement here is 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.530
 just before leaving to know how to do 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.420
 here you do a fast 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.340

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.000
 when he does not have that to do 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.490
 so yes well yes we have one of the listeners 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.719
 which brings us important details 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.670
 and we have very good zitter there is one 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:29.770
 who said that last night two months ago 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.880
 different and in the first half time and 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.890
 the second where there was too much drunk 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.810
 you cant make you fear andy forehead 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.670
 is that the three goals and more 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.149
 enlarge the score and we do not say it 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.359
 often enough 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.950
 first scrum but that puts things 

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:43.810
 in their county in the studies one 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.219
 contact so it's not bad then 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.350
 of course we can talk about the fact 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:48.929
 that so yesterday France to win against 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.999
 Norway 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:53.530
 no it was not now no no but 

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:55.600
 if it had happened 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.710
 it's a little exaggerated its windows the 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.179
 not see any small I pay will 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.710
 survive up then you go from somewhere else 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:00.609
 we are not going to go wrong 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.499
 race 

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:04.210

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.909

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.880

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.650

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.380
 of a box he may have calmed them 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.700
 so we won 4 0 and 100 certain 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.770
 that they are said are certainly 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.390
 so-called essential lalati are 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.400

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.570
 incredible titles and he was in the 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.190
 nice goal did but it needed them 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.360
 Nevertheless rehabilitate held tonight they 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.250
 were not there and we still 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.050
 won 4-0 and we did not miss this little 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.030

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.900

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.030

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.480
 it was of course of him that I wanted 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.890

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.110
 glorious to have beaten norway but 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.480
 good yes but the Belgians them they have 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.010
 beat the luxembourg 1 I remember that the 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.299
 luxembourg the best sportsmen it is 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.250
 stéphane bern and the schleck brothers 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.810

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.299

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:37.130

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.570
 Of wood 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.160
 only the problem is that I have 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.390
 listened to the questions of our troubles and the 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.850

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.500

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.079

 con necessarily they have the language of wood 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:13.519
 look for example karim benzema no 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.340

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:18.440
