 Moscow has already got a lot of games. 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.190
 imitators trying to make money

 a little money soaked in blood but 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.030
 many of them soon realized that it was impossible 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.590
 just an akade druganov kimono karate

 mortal kombat clones down to the letter kei 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:05.909
 in the title part of the success mortal kombat 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.350
 was in digitized fighters 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.750
 who gave the game realistic 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.130
 even though years later you 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.440
 understood what simple tricks 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.210
 increased the number of fighters samsung was 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.920
 the same actor that played sub ziro only in 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.630
 a wig with a sharp beard just that 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.430
 by and went handmade software with 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.770
 creating a clone called sum 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.840
 ninja they digitized the actors added 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.670
 bloody finishing moves and pocketed 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.439
 for a lot of money unfortunately for them 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.780
 atari jaguar console restrictions were 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.119
 such that the game looked terrible and 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.070
 worse than most characters played 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.350
 were poor racial stereotypes 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.210
 among them was the idea of shooting scalps and 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.210
 the fireman who shot fireballs 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.259
 lifting kill 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.579
 admit I begin to understand why 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.579
 game people did not like 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:53.330
 long before the note dane started 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.820
 issue on playstation hits like flippers 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.740
 of ace and a series of ancharted studio has created 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.170
 way of the warrior clone mortal kombat 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.939
 very tangled backstory in it 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.039
 figured a book that looked like 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.750
 necronomicon and the sinister dead 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:07.670
 but which actually was a book about 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.830
 fights a collection of the best fighters 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.569
 of the world according to this book one of the best 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.880
 the fighters of the world was Austrian's dense 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.290
 named jack shake 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.150
 brokers exchange probably and pumped up 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.519
 warrior named Major get to 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.750
 before the flippers of up to this level seemed 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:25.250
 far total carnage super combo 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.930
 wilde warrior were also fatalities 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.880
 only now most of them betrayed 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.709
 obvious no knowledge of human anatomy 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.299
 or all participants in the tournament had 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.890
 some serious illnesses due to 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:40.790
 which they split apart from 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:48.500
 no shock shocking 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:50.630
 won no mercy you are pathetic it was 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.760
 try date and aim for mortal kombat 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.769
 tattoo assassins by strange coincidence 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.870
 circumstances was created under the authority 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:59.060
 bob gale screenwriter back the future and 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.760
 so what story for the game came up 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.709
 this script master is in her 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.570
 magic tattoo from which too 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.970
 animates tattoos and they kill people 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.130
 compared to this even the plot back to 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.989
 future 3 looks quite decent to 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.790
 this added a chaotic set of fighters 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.769
 including a figure skater who fought not 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.750
 take off your skates is a brilliant idea 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:20.329
 cyber killer named stream ac 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.910
 current without joking a guy named derek and 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:25.459
 stripper because without her 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.160
 the game was 2196 finishing moves 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.480
 including standard bloody fatalities 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.970
 animations before they even appeared 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.190
 mortal kombat and also some kind of crap and 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.200
 even stripping adversary tattoo 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.730
 assassins never officially came out 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.680
 for the most part due to the fact that she was 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.299
 terrible but still in some other game 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.609
 you can unleash a skeleton 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:46.490
 rock stars so he blew up opponents 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:52.670
 dory in guitar riff 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:54.800
 Eric even defeated a street fighter 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.840
 mine though I did not check though 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.490
 characters fornication storm were drawn they 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.320
 digitized it also struggles 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.910
 tried to wrest from the pie mortal kombat 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.830
 pushing the bloody gameplay 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.690
 the developers even persuaded daniel 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.710
 orange actor who played Johnny 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.570
 cage in mortal kombat 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.040
 leave the honey and withdraw for advertising 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.050
 blue storm here we see him 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.720
 enjoying fornication 100 rub playing on hand 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:16.370
 for 2 players why is that different 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.140
 blu-100 frames so this is an opportunity to strip 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.480
 the enemy of the limb and the mach 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.610
 continued fatalities could do 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.200
 each round which led to interesting 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.030
 Metamorphosis to someone first 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.010
 cut off the head and in the second round 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.720
 he grew up a friend no worse than the first 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:35.210
 it is correct freon and it will pass 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:37.220
 laugh go to hell world dies 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.720
 shortened was another mortal clone 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.990
 coma for console tv video 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.750

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.550
 all these games came out in 1994 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.410
 Nyshe year was for lousy then 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.060
 fighting game in general about criminal 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.100
 organization whose boss is dying and his 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.440
 the main assistants in the battles find out 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.120
 who will be the new boss is very likely 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.770
 that the new boss will be better than the parties because 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.870
 that he manages to dial an assistant 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:03.520
 cleaner of some daddy and agent fbi 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:05.930

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.640
 after winning you are invited to finish 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.740
 rival but programmers were too lazy 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.630
 put these tricks so you just 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.400
 beat in the face and the round ends and 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:16.880
 that's all you can do 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:19.580
 and all I can ask you is the same 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.530
 the biggest trouser for sex tires and so this 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.690
 there were 5 clones of mortal kombat about which 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.530
 it is better to remember dice to remember that what 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.480
 it was even worse 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.920
