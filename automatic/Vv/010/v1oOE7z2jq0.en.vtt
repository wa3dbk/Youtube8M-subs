the disc is made in autorun feature for

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.790 
the disc is made in autorun feature for
it<00:00:57.570> because<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.960> just<00:00:57.989> have<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.440> go<00:00:58.559> look

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
it because you just have to go look

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.709 
it because you just have to go look
through<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.039> disc<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.550> find<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.180> files<00:01:00.449> you

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
through the disc and find the files you

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:09.140 
through the disc and find the files you
need<00:01:04.339> so<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.369> i<00:01:06.950> would<00:01:07.950> click<00:01:08.070> on<00:01:08.280> intensity<00:01:08.820> cuz

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
need so I i would click on intensity cuz

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.500 
need so I i would click on intensity cuz
mine<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.439> install<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.830> driver<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.640> wouldn't

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
mine and you install a driver I wouldn't

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.170 
mine and you install a driver I wouldn't
trust<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:13.110> driver<00:01:13.439> here<00:01:13.909> because<00:01:14.909> this<00:01:15.119> is

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
trust this driver here because this is

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.870 
trust this driver here because this is
whatever's<00:01:15.720> on<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.020> disc<00:01:16.290> but<00:01:17.100> usually<00:01:17.729> it

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
whatever's on the disc but usually it

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.660 
whatever's on the disc but usually it
won't<00:01:18.119> work<00:01:18.360> because<00:01:19.170> they're<00:01:19.530> old<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:20.460> you

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
won't work because they're old so you

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.570 
won't work because they're old so you
just<00:01:20.970> need<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.330> go<00:01:21.450> there<00:01:21.600> website<00:01:22.700> so<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:25.580> these

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
should have and here are use the diagram

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.730 
should have and here are use the diagram
of<00:01:49.650> it<00:01:49.800> is<00:01:50.400> employed<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.120> the<00:01:51.300> farthest<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:52.140> the

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
of it is employed is the farthest to the

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.460 
of it is employed is the farthest to the
right<00:01:53.330> one<00:01:54.330> if<00:01:54.720> you're<00:01:54.870> looking<00:01:55.020> at<00:01:55.350> it

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
right one if you're looking at it

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.720 
right one if you're looking at it
straight<00:01:56.370> from<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.640> back<00:01:56.790> your<00:01:57.000> computer

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:58.730 
straight from the back your computer

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:04.370 
straight from the back your computer
okay<00:02:02.450> so<00:02:03.450> I'm<00:02:03.540> trying<00:02:03.780> out<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:03.960> new<00:02:04.050> screen

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
okay so I'm trying out a new screen

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.640 
okay so I'm trying out a new screen
recording<00:02:05.630> so<00:02:06.630> that's<00:02:06.780> how<00:02:06.930> that<00:02:06.990> works<00:02:07.170> and

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
recording so that's how that works and

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.639 
recording so that's how that works and
then<00:02:08.520> you're<00:02:08.790> gonna<00:02:08.880> want<00:02:09.180> to<00:02:09.270> install<00:02:09.649> media

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
then you're gonna want to install media

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.980 
then you're gonna want to install media
Express<00:02:12.380> and<00:02:13.380> I<00:02:14.100> think<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.850> converse<00:02:15.240> is<00:02:15.270> 2.2

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
Express and I think the converse is 2.2

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.680 
Express and I think the converse is 2.2
this<00:02:16.260> is<00:02:16.380> old<00:02:16.560> as<00:02:16.740> well<00:02:17.390> it's<00:02:18.390> pretty<00:02:18.570> simple

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
this is old as well it's pretty simple

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.900 
this is old as well it's pretty simple
from<00:02:19.140> there<00:02:22.250> now<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:23.310> don't<00:02:23.550> really<00:02:23.700> hear

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
from there now you don't really hear

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.600 
from there now you don't really hear
read<00:02:24.090> through<00:02:24.270> this<00:02:24.390> it's<00:02:24.570> very<00:02:24.750> simple<00:02:25.610> so

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
read through this it's very simple so

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.180 
read through this it's very simple so
I'll<00:02:26.820> go<00:02:27.090> ahead<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.410> fire<00:02:28.410> it<00:02:28.530> up<00:02:30.980> now<00:02:31.980> mike

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
I'll go ahead and fire it up now mike

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.120 
I'll go ahead and fire it up now mike
has<00:02:32.220> two<00:02:32.850> screens<00:02:33.240> the<00:02:33.660> 10<00:02:33.930> cats<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.530> main<00:02:34.890> one

has two screens the 10 cats the main one
it's<00:02:35.940> hdmi<00:02:36.900> input<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.530> I<00:02:38.400> have<00:02:38.520> a<00:02:38.550> switch

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
it's hdmi input and I have a switch

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.870 
it's hdmi input and I have a switch
behind<00:02:39.240> it<00:02:39.630> so<00:02:39.990> I<00:02:40.050> can<00:02:40.320> switch<00:02:40.620> from<00:02:40.980> my

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
behind it so I can switch from my

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.020 
behind it so I can switch from my
computer's<00:02:42.450> output<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.739> the<00:02:43.880> capture<00:02:44.880> card

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.300 
like mine's 1080i right now hdmi so that
means<00:03:39.520> we<00:03:39.700> have<00:03:39.850> to<00:03:40.060> do<00:03:40.180> with<00:03:40.920> media<00:03:41.920> Express

out so if this doesn't match up but you

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.360 
out so if this doesn't match up but you
won't<00:03:57.940> see<00:03:58.209> it<00:03:58.590> their<00:03:59.590> allotted<00:03:59.890> for<00:04:00.220> ones

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:53.069 
thing i have and the wires will run

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:56.540 
thing i have and the wires will run
behind<00:04:53.189> the<00:04:53.460> desk<00:04:53.669> so<00:04:54.360> you<00:04:54.449> can<00:04:54.629> see<00:04:54.779> that<00:04:55.550> all

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
behind the desk so you can see that all

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.820 
behind the desk so you can see that all
right<00:04:57.379> so<00:04:58.379> now<00:04:58.529> i'll<00:04:58.680> show<00:04:58.710> you<00:05:00.560> hdmi<00:05:01.560> switch

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
right so now i'll show you hdmi switch

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:08.330 
right so now i'll show you hdmi switch
on<00:05:02.069> my<00:05:02.310> monitor<00:05:03.090> versity<00:05:06.710> know<00:05:07.710> that<00:05:07.949> does<00:05:08.159> is

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
on my monitor versity know that does is

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.050 
on my monitor versity know that does is
a<00:05:08.370> switch<00:05:08.699> is<00:05:09.319> it<00:05:10.319> takes<00:05:10.620> the<00:05:11.060> computers

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
a switch is it takes the computers

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.360 
a switch is it takes the computers
output<00:05:12.509> and<00:05:12.810> shuts<00:05:13.080> it<00:05:13.229> off<00:05:13.349> so<00:05:13.620> it's<00:05:13.770> just<00:05:13.889> vga

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
output and shuts it off so it's just vga

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.029 
output and shuts it off so it's just vga
so<00:05:14.909> the<00:05:15.270> only<00:05:15.419> computer<00:05:16.050> output<00:05:16.289> goes<00:05:16.620> to<00:05:16.860> the

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 
so the only computer output goes to the

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:21.379 
so the only computer output goes to the
standard<00:05:17.849> left<00:05:18.629> mater<00:05:18.870> and<00:05:19.199> the<00:05:19.460> output<00:05:20.460> for

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:21.389 
standard left mater and the output for

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:24.559 
standard left mater and the output for
the<00:05:22.310> intensity<00:05:23.310> card<00:05:23.610> goes<00:05:24.060> to<00:05:24.360> the<00:05:24.449> right

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:24.569 
the intensity card goes to the right
