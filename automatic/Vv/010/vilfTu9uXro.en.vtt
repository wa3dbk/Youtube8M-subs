00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:11.950
 I paint my beloved faults, my dear ones. 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.510
 also with you 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.430
 come on, our second video of 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.350
 biology of this project which is in enem 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.420
 action and as I explained to you in 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.890
 our last class of during that 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.869
 The project then goes to work 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.779
 some issues that have fallen on enem 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.580
 I'll explain to you then which ones 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.189
 the advice of biology that we will 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.050
 to use in the process of 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.579
 resolution of exercises and there the people 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.929
 work a little bit again some 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:36.819
 matters right 

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:39.159
 we are going to do a review based on 

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:41.379
 issues and we will use a 

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:42.309
 issue of the 2012 enem that I want 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:46.359
 you do not even care 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:48.760
 along with me, let's go there, he says here 

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:50.289
 people is a transgenic corn is produced 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.409
 from the handling of corn 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:55.659
 original with the transfer to this 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:57.760
 a gene of interest taken from another 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:59.409
 body of a species other than 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.350
 characteristic of interest will be 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:03.159
 manifested as a result then 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.860
 will happen 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:07.150
 and transgenics as we saw in the 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.650
 Our Engineering Techniques Class 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:14.860
 genetics are a soussan product in 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.770
 agricultural products which are generated 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.960
 from induced genetic mutations 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:24.070
 then this transgenic process is 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:26.830
 for example in the synthesis of 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.630
 insulin is recombinant insulin 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.330
 then this idea of ​​inducing a 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.150
 genetic recombination is widely used 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.990
 in various areas of am al 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:40.240
 biotechnology in what we do when we 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.520
 we are going to create a transgenic so the 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.650
 people use a restriction enzyme that 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.020
 an enzyme capable of cleaving the dna to 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.260
 take a genius out of an organism and people 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:53.050
 this genius inserts it into the genome of 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.390
 other body what will happen this 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.409
 organism that will receive the gene that 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:03.310
 be the transgenic organism it goes 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:06.070
 this recombinant DNA and transcribe the m 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.619
 right recombinant messenger 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.709
 then the recombinant messenger will 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.920
 translated into the United States and 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.050
 generate a ready 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.650
 and recombination where this protein 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.630
 the recombinant will then confer this 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.520
 transgenic is a characteristic that it 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.650
 had not previously will not do 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.910
 with which this transgenic passes expression 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.739
 a feature he could not 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.110
 express why he did not have the gene 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.120
 now he has the gene then this gene 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.130
 new this recombinant gene will be 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.560
 transcript will then be translated and 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.080
 protein will give a novelty 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.459
 metabolic process in this process then 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.030
 Do you want to know what people are looking at? 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.489
 over there 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.239
 he wants to know if this 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.790
 characteristic of interest will be 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.810
 manifested as a result of what 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.790
 I told you she's going to get 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.150
 manifest as a result of the transcription 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.580
 of recombinant DNA and after translation 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.680
 from the recombinant messenger 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.590
 then look at the alternative and here it says 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.230
 What do you think of the translation of RN? 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.840
 messenger synthesized from the dna 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:09.730
 recombinant and then such alternative is 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.739
 our right alternative right 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.420
 So people, if you want, then give 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.890
 one read in this exercise is in enem 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.870
 2012 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.489
 any doubt you can look for the people of the 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.290
 that of the vestibular enters there in our 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.090
 site puts your question our forum 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.200
 who will have a huge pleasure answering 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.850
 for you it's right 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.400
 We'll see you in the next video in the week 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.890
 A hug comes and until then 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.510
 just one more little message if you've come to 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.160
 here is why you probably liked it 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.780
 of my class so I wanted to ask for 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.549
 You give a little strength to 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.739
 People, if you come here, I'll be right there. 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:43.100
 I left you the link to our page 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:45.769
 on facebook and our twitter account 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.660
 then like it our page follows the 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.459
 people on twitter and if you enter 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.079
 our site has a lot of content 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.459
 Nice, we have text, we have people. 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:53.720
 more videos 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.519
 If you have any questions, we have 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.870
 a very cool forum here gives you 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.340
 take your doubts 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.260
 So this force we share 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.640
 with your friends that our work and 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.450
 Let's make this project grow every 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.450
 once more a grace
