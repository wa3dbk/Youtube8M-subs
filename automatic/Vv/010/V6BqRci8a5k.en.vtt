00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
doing it very accurately to just simply

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.439 
doing it very accurately to just simply
retrace<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.489> that's<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.789> very<00:00:53.820> heavy<00:00:54.180> line

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
retrace it and that's a very heavy line

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.060 
retrace it and that's a very heavy line
here<00:00:56.600> with<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.629> same<00:00:57.989> colors<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.859> same

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
effect and same emphasis that it had

probably 12 to 15 years ago well
normally<00:01:10.560> it's<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.710> conservative<00:01:11.040> we<00:01:11.400> wouldn't

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
normally it's a conservative we wouldn't

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.850 
normally it's a conservative we wouldn't
recreate<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.689> piece<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:13.080> art<00:01:13.260> like<00:01:13.740> this<00:01:13.950> but
