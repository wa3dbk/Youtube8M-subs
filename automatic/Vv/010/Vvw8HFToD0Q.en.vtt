00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 And there, beauty people today, I'm going to teach. 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.830
 how to put together this puzzle that 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.210
 which is 3 by 31 for five only that she 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.130
 three Portuguese by five that change from 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.440
 how it was made 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.960
 three by three that this internal part 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.100
 here and glue a layer over a 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.320
 layer down 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.689
 this top layer not seen lonely 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.029
 can generate along with the other 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.490
 the same thing down here can be achieved 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.279
 take these two can not retrieve sleep 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.199
 Everyone here turns on why. 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.690
 these two are together these two are 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.130
 together then they will is also a thing 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.950
 Right here 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.960
 now up there is no way to separate this 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.390
 this species is stuck in this 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.020
 this round in this then you can even 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.620
 come here and then come here because this 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.739
 This is it. 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.260
 changing shape to solve the break 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.809
 head is the same as 13 for three 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.090
 you just have to have the complication you have 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.190
 one more piece on top will see that it is 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.609
 just like three by three without taking 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.470
 per 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.450
 I re-pack here already explains how 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.750
 is it ready even though the law 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.880
 packing three by three normal did 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.180
 the same things here in this one if you 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.330
 to repair the part that is three by three per 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.799
 five tac to know that here the distance 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.310
 from here to here and small 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.439
 It's only three feet from here to five 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.130
 this one is the top is down or vice 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.820
 versa 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.950
 ie the top green is from below 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.290
 and blue where I was helped is low 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.759
 green will choose to face low to 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.700
 team that also has a part that 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.210
 It's okay, then I 'll make the cross. 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.640
 blue 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.899
 personal blue cross looks have one of the cross 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:49.229
 here it is already in place of the cross 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.220
 in a corner people this here is the cross vera 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.200
 cross from above 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.840
 that's what's the cross is in the middle and 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:00.210
 kicked in the corner to realize what the 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:03.710
 center corner corner corner corner 666 666 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:07.439
 so look here yellow 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:10.319
 're another one here also the cross is 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:13.020
 look here in the middle middle middle middle 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:22.610
 corner corner corner corner and center 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:22.610
 red with almost orange blue red 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.920
 I made the cross now, I'm going to put the corners 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.600
 I'm not going to make a daddy sell 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.750
 because it 's harder 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.580
 your gaze now everyone had notion 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.210
 I sing because those of the cross are already here. 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:44.940
 this here is a red and white corner 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:46.560
 red and white only fit in the other 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:55.790
 I sing here the red and yellow have to 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:55.790
 come up and up put 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:08.310
 here in box here in box 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:10.590
 Beauty is good 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:15.360
 now it was the second layer this is the 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:18.840
 first layer the second layer this 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.720
 part is ready, this piece is here. 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.240
 orange and yellow here 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:28.100
 This play has to come here. It leads to 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:31.530
 away from her side to farther back 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:35.730
 and now boxed 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:38.850
 I found the second layer orange and white 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.690
 have to fit here takes away the 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.690
 same thing 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.270
 only this one that is now red and 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.450
 I have to come here. It takes me to 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.450
 far 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.800
 I'm ready for the second layer too. 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.540
 Now let's go up and do what I do. 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.120
 first cross on top right 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:06.090
 while it has the cross on top that is the 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:09.590
 center has two points these two insurance 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:14.270
 here I make the algorithm from the cross comes from above 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.270
 right up right 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:19.709
 How many green songs have you woken up? 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.229
 on 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:25.639
 no if not sing time try green 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:31.009
 here do the right sony 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:33.289
 one right on itÃ¡ twice 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:38.270
 up back 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:43.430
 sure a corner maybe it will work out right? 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:46.999
 but I dream again and ready 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:49.310
 Beauty now guides everything with color 

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:51.800
 right up I'm going to have two songs 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.900
 with the same color 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.509
 I do not have it so I'll do it twice 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:05:00.710
 here I will make the oil once right 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:03.919
 nor right has ever hurt our skin nor 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:06.469
 appeared helio garcia from work now 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:09.979
 it is not just his back or to 

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:12.139
 low back of the leg plus the penalty 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:14.719
 When you have to show up here two 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:18.520
 same in two with the same color let 

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:23.839
 back and do it again right right 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:27.199
 behind took me back down to my 

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:31.250
 Leg is now and everything is alright 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:34.129
 rest beauty fix one thing is 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:37.219
 ready just need to make the Minerva will 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:41.180
 generate in this sense here crying turns 

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:45.430
 front turns on and with the same color 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:52.819
 playing in the middle back twice 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:57.050
 Minerva back from the mail high forward 

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:59.029
 Back down, it's good the same as 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.279
 I have to change anything for three 

00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:03.349
 It is cool to see with different format 

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:04.430
 seems to be more difficult but it is not 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:07.960
 not much 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.960
 Beauty, good luck
