00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.349
 Dear parents, I would like to join you today 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.799
 talk about a banal effect 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:14.210
 namely the simple snuff 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:16.070
 Snuffing is the very common thing at 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.779
 children found a snuff must 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.090
 actually do not worry parents 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.800
 children need so easy for their effects 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.050
 to train the immune system 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.779
 What do you think now has a cold 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.670
 It is important that the nose remains free 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.119
 because only by a free nose no one 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.989
 child breathe normally and drink as well 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.040
 often a cold closes 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.050
 cough 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.390
 This happens so if the children 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.729
 flat the mucus are the nose down 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.979
 runs and a cough arises as long as 

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:44.690
 but not with breathlessness and fever 

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:47.390
 alliance must also mean that the parents still 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.769
 not worried because this cough must 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.170
 be thereby the mucus by 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:53.269
 transported outside and you can easily 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.449
 always say as long as the children then 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:58.339
 are still in the mood to play laugh 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.199
 this is a normal one 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:03.100
 cough that does not have the parents 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:05.720
 calm down what are now warning signs 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.189
 Warning signs are above all when 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.350
 the general condition of the children 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.670
 is impaired and that can be mothers 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.770
 always judge very well 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.109
 on the one hand it is natural if fever 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.060
 come and if the children just 

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:18.079
 get really bad if they give him 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.869
 breathe hard 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:23.149
 you can often see that on the chest then 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.219
 we call it so collect the 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.590
 so to speak, the skin pulled inside 

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:30.170
 are and that the children with the belly 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.850
 breathing forwards see parents too 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.469
 fast that the breathing becomes too fast 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.719
 these are always a sign that the 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:37.579
 children due to shortage of air and then 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:38.920
 should urgently be a doctor of course 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:41.719
 be visited 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.869
 and if the kids drink that badly 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:46.249
 is a very complete even with infants 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:49.249
 decisive criterion for writing 

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:51.109
 it's just a harmless cough 

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:53.149
 by the dull conditional or 

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:56.359
 does it really start a bronchitis or 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:58.310
 but I become pneumonia 

00:01:56.359 --> 00:02:00.020
 think mothers can do that very much 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.569
 Good judge you know your children 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.880
 so if the kids are good as always 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:06.409
 Drink happy and then laugh 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.060
 Parents can snuff all over 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.700
 be able to calm the children 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.220
 give nasal drops and wait for it 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.390
 A very important measure goes away 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.760
 Of course, this is already here 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.470
 early stage the kids like me always 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.410
 Say no to the traffic 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.660
 So it should be first in infants 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.640
 age then no children groups 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.560
 more to be visited when the children 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.720
 For example, go for a baby swim 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.040
 should that be set and if 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.440
 one has the possibility in the kindergarten 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.930
 to look after the children differently 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.790
 while, for example, a grandma that likes times 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.560
 would take the grandson 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.720
 then you should be in the early days 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.930
 stadium children from kindergarten 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.390
 pull out 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.860
 because I think the prophylaxis is 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.520
 more important than the children later 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.470
 look after 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.750
 and if you join the kids early 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.340
 a banal snuff calm comes thinking 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.410
 you often prevent that from happening 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.600
 Complications like bronchitis or 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.760
 middle ear infections comes and then 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:03.010
 the children can also join this month 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.010
 survive the frequent infections well
