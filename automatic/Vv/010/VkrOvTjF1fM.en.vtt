00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
2013 everyone I'm with family over just

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.760 
2013 everyone I'm with family over just
north<00:00:17.609> of<00:00:17.760> Roanoke<00:00:18.240> Virginia<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:19.350> it's

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
north of Roanoke Virginia and it's

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.279 
north of Roanoke Virginia and it's
absolutely<00:00:20.310> beautiful<00:00:20.670> out<00:00:21.390> here<00:00:21.449> as<00:00:21.869> you<00:00:22.170> can

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
absolutely beautiful out here as you can

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.130 
absolutely beautiful out here as you can
very<00:00:22.320> well<00:00:22.650> see<00:00:22.800> behind<00:00:23.550> me<00:00:23.810> nothing<00:00:24.810> but<00:00:24.960> nice

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
very well see behind me nothing but nice

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.490 
very well see behind me nothing but nice
rolling<00:00:25.560> hills<00:00:26.990> but<00:00:27.990> what<00:00:28.109> we're<00:00:28.230> gonna<00:00:28.380> do

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
rolling hills but what we're gonna do

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.830 
rolling hills but what we're gonna do
today<00:00:28.680> is<00:00:28.830> yet<00:00:29.490> another<00:00:29.840> electronics

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
today is yet another electronics

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.720 
today is yet another electronics
experiment<00:00:31.410> because<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:31.710> just<00:00:32.009> can't<00:00:32.309> stop

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
experiment because I just can't stop

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.150 
experiment because I just can't stop
playing<00:00:32.969> with<00:00:33.210> them<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:33.780> have<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.620> setting<00:00:35.040> up

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
playing with them I have it setting up

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.639 
playing with them I have it setting up
right<00:00:35.850> down<00:00:36.120> here<00:00:36.450> so<00:00:37.050> let<00:00:37.260> me<00:00:37.350> bring<00:00:37.530> the

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
right down here so let me bring the

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.470 
right down here so let me bring the
camera<00:00:37.950> on<00:00:38.100> down<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.850> we'll<00:00:38.969> take<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.180> look<00:00:39.390> and

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
camera on down and we'll take a look and

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.880 
camera on down and we'll take a look and
see<00:00:39.660> what<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:39.870> got<00:00:40.079> going<00:00:40.110> on<00:00:42.440> okay<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:43.500> the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
see what I got going on okay so the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.400 
see what I got going on okay so the
experiment<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.579> have<00:00:44.820> today<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.809> has<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.289> do

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
experiment I have today it has to do

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.880 
experiment I have today it has to do
with<00:00:46.440> these<00:00:46.770> C<00:00:47.399> IGS<00:00:48.030> or<00:00:48.450> SIG's<00:00:48.809> solar<00:00:49.500> cells

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
with these C IGS or SIG's solar cells

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.360 
with these C IGS or SIG's solar cells
also<00:00:50.520> known<00:00:50.850> as<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:50.969> thin<00:00:51.300> film<00:00:51.510> solar<00:00:51.870> cell<00:00:52.370> the

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
also known as a thin film solar cell the

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.450 
also known as a thin film solar cell the
theory<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:55.170> read<00:00:55.350> online<00:00:55.500> if<00:00:56.219> you

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
theory is that you read online if you

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.549 
theory is that you read online if you
light<00:00:56.879> soaked<00:00:57.300> these<00:00:57.539> without<00:00:57.840> anything

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
light soaked these without anything

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.459 
light soaked these without anything
attached<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.160> them<00:00:59.309> for<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.489> few<00:00:59.760> hours<00:00:59.789> it

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
attached to them for a few hours it

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:02.299 
attached to them for a few hours it
changes<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.559> way<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.829> crystalline

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
changes the way the crystalline

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.030 
changes the way the crystalline
structure<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:03.059> in<00:01:03.270> them<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.860> increases<00:01:04.860> the

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
structure is in them and increases the

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.000 
structure is in them and increases the
efficiency<00:01:05.309> up<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:06.090> 10%<00:01:06.390> more<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.710> what<00:01:07.860> we're

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
efficiency up to 10% more so what we're

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.980 
efficiency up to 10% more so what we're
going<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.159> do<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.970> we're<00:01:09.180> going<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.390> read<00:01:09.869> them

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
going to do is we're going to read them

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.010 
going to do is we're going to read them
both<00:01:10.200> in<00:01:10.439> voltage<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.340> open<00:01:12.090> current<00:01:12.479> open

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
both in voltage and open current open

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.950 
both in voltage and open current open
circuit<00:01:13.380> current<00:01:14.130> get<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.119> baseline<00:01:15.540> on<00:01:15.840> them

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
circuit current get a baseline on them

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.960 
circuit current get a baseline on them
then<00:01:16.380> I'm<00:01:16.439> gonna<00:01:16.590> leave<00:01:16.740> this<00:01:17.100> one<00:01:17.369> outside

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
then I'm gonna leave this one outside

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.149 
then I'm gonna leave this one outside
for<00:01:18.330> five<00:01:18.509> hours<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.290> bright<00:01:19.500> Sun<00:01:19.799> today

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
for five hours in the bright Sun today

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.219 
for five hours in the bright Sun today
take<00:01:20.850> this<00:01:20.939> one<00:01:21.090> back<00:01:21.270> inside<00:01:21.630> so<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:21.960> doesn't

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
take this one back inside so it doesn't

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.679 
take this one back inside so it doesn't
light<00:01:22.409> soak<00:01:22.759> wait<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.880> four<00:01:24.090> or<00:01:24.180> five<00:01:24.299> hours

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
light soak wait the four or five hours

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.719 
light soak wait the four or five hours
then<00:01:25.170> I'll<00:01:25.320> bring<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:25.680> one<00:01:25.920> back<00:01:25.950> out<00:01:26.549> and

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
then I'll bring this one back out and

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.700 
then I'll bring this one back out and
we'll<00:01:27.180> take<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.479> readings<00:01:27.780> again<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.259> see<00:01:28.590> if

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
we'll take the readings again and see if

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.410 
we'll take the readings again and see if
there<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:28.950> an<00:01:29.159> improvement<00:01:29.579> from<00:01:30.150> light

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
there is an improvement from light

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.740 
there is an improvement from light
soaking<00:01:30.900> this<00:01:31.470> solar<00:01:32.310> cell<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:33.329> let's<00:01:33.509> get<00:01:33.600> our

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
soaking this solar cell so let's get our

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.210 
soaking this solar cell so let's get our
baseline<00:01:34.229> reading<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:34.710> we're<00:01:34.860> going<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.009> start

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
baseline reading so we're going to start

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.160 
baseline reading so we're going to start
in<00:01:35.340> voltage<00:01:35.759> on<00:01:35.970> both<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.360> them<00:01:36.509> then<00:01:37.020> we'll

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
in voltage on both of them then we'll

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.710 
in voltage on both of them then we'll
switch<00:01:37.259> over<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:38.000> short-circuit<00:01:39.000> current

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.020 

okay<00:01:42.720> this<00:01:43.079> one's<00:01:43.259> reading<00:01:43.619> four<00:01:44.340> point<00:01:44.670> four

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
okay this one's reading four point four

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:55.510 
okay this one's reading four point four
three<00:01:45.240> volts

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.429 

this<00:01:56.520> one's<00:01:56.820> reading<00:01:57.060> 4.43

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
this one's reading 4.43

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.249 
this one's reading 4.43
for<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:59.280> both<00:02:00.180> so<00:02:00.479> they're<00:02:00.630> reading<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.990> exact

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
for to both so they're reading the exact

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:09.949 
for to both so they're reading the exact
same<00:02:01.439> voltage<00:02:08.149> switch<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.330> meter<00:02:09.450> over<00:02:09.690> two

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
same voltage switch and meter over two

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:17.449 
same voltage switch and meter over two
milliamp<00:02:10.649> s'<00:02:15.890> now<00:02:16.890> if<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:17.130> read<00:02:17.280> the

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
milliamp s' now if you read the

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:26.900 
milliamp s' now if you read the
short-circuit<00:02:18.209> current<00:02:18.420> on<00:02:18.810> them<00:02:25.819> it's<00:02:26.819> like

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
short-circuit current on them it's like

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:35.289 
short-circuit current on them it's like
82<00:02:27.500> 82<00:02:28.500> mo<00:02:29.010> laughs<00:02:29.250> let's<00:02:29.610> go<00:02:29.700> of<00:02:29.790> 82<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.209> lamps

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:39.860 

yeah<00:02:37.700> let's<00:02:38.700> go<00:02:38.850> with<00:02:38.940> about<00:02:39.060> 82<00:02:39.480> milliamp

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
yeah let's go with about 82 milliamp

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:58.000 
yeah let's go with about 82 milliamp
roughly

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.120 

this<00:02:59.010> one's<00:02:59.190> reading<00:02:59.400> about<00:02:59.580> 82<00:03:00.000> as<00:03:00.150> well<00:03:01.130> okay

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
this one's reading about 82 as well okay

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.770 
this one's reading about 82 as well okay
so<00:03:02.190> now<00:03:02.430> we're<00:03:02.550> gonna<00:03:02.640> take<00:03:02.850> this<00:03:03.330> one<00:03:03.480> away

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
so now we're gonna take this one away

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.250 
so now we're gonna take this one away
take<00:03:04.320> it<00:03:04.440> back<00:03:04.560> inside<00:03:05.010> where<00:03:05.550> there's<00:03:05.700> no<00:03:05.820> Sun

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
take it back inside where there's no Sun

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.990 
take it back inside where there's no Sun
take<00:03:07.260> this<00:03:07.380> one<00:03:07.590> face<00:03:07.860> it<00:03:08.010> eat<00:03:08.130> perfectly<00:03:08.640> for

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
take this one face it eat perfectly for

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.540 
take this one face it eat perfectly for
the<00:03:09.060> Sun<00:03:09.270> let<00:03:09.930> it<00:03:10.020> sit<00:03:10.290> for<00:03:10.320> five<00:03:10.680> hours<00:03:10.710> we'll

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
the Sun let it sit for five hours we'll

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.730 
the Sun let it sit for five hours we'll
be<00:03:11.580> on<00:03:11.700> back<00:03:12.060> and<00:03:12.930> then<00:03:13.110> we'll<00:03:13.260> bring<00:03:13.440> in<00:03:13.560> and

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
be on back and then we'll bring in and

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.840 
be on back and then we'll bring in and
test<00:03:14.010> them<00:03:14.130> again<00:03:14.370> okay<00:03:16.400> what<00:03:17.400> this<00:03:17.610> solar

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
test them again okay what this solar

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.880 
test them again okay what this solar
panel<00:03:17.940> sit<00:03:18.420> out<00:03:18.510> for<00:03:18.660> five<00:03:18.840> hours<00:03:18.870> now<00:03:19.440> I<00:03:19.800> took

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
panel sit out for five hours now I took

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.490 
panel sit out for five hours now I took
it<00:03:20.100> out<00:03:20.310> of<00:03:20.370> this<00:03:20.550> on<00:03:20.760> 15<00:03:21.360> minutes<00:03:21.570> let<00:03:22.380> the

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
it out of this on 15 minutes let the

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.440 
it out of this on 15 minutes let the
panel<00:03:22.830> pull<00:03:23.010> down<00:03:23.250> from<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.580> solar<00:03:23.940> exposure

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
panel pull down from the solar exposure

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.060 
panel pull down from the solar exposure
this<00:03:25.200> way<00:03:25.380> they're<00:03:25.560> both<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:25.860> same

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
this way they're both the same

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.530 
this way they're both the same
temperature<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:26.610> I<00:03:26.820> get<00:03:26.970> a<00:03:27.000> correct<00:03:27.330> reading

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
temperature and I get a correct reading

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.810 
temperature and I get a correct reading
so<00:03:28.200> let's<00:03:28.380> read<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.680> voltage<00:03:29.040> on<00:03:29.190> both<00:03:29.460> first

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
so let's read the voltage on both first

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:40.820 
so let's read the voltage on both first
then<00:03:30.480> we'll<00:03:30.630> read<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:31.080> current<00:03:39.440> point<00:03:40.440> 7

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
then we'll read the current point 7

00:03:40.830 --> 00:04:05.450 
then we'll read the current point 7
volts<00:03:45.980> 4.5<00:04:02.630> 667<00:04:03.630> milliamp<00:04:04.080> s--<00:04:04.230> on<00:04:05.130> the<00:04:05.250> lights

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:05.460 
volts 4.5 667 milliamp s-- on the lights

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:15.210 
volts 4.5 667 milliamp s-- on the lights
oak

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.080 

giggle<00:04:16.220> right<00:04:16.340> angle<00:04:16.729> here

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
giggle right angle here

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:29.710 
giggle right angle here
Oh<00:04:19.000> 65<00:04:20.000> milliamps

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.470 

so<00:04:30.720> there<00:04:30.900> you<00:04:30.990> have<00:04:31.020> it<00:04:31.530> white<00:04:32.100> soaking<00:04:32.580> a<00:04:32.790> six

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
so there you have it white soaking a six

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.650 
so there you have it white soaking a six
or<00:04:33.810> thin-film<00:04:34.650> solar<00:04:35.400> cell<00:04:35.820> gives<00:04:36.510> you

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
or thin-film solar cell gives you

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.290

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
roughly in my instance six to seven

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.870 
roughly in my instance six to seven

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
percent permanent increase in power from

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.030 
percent permanent increase in power from
the<00:04:42.000> solar<00:04:42.210> cell<00:04:42.540> they<00:04:43.199> usually<00:04:43.380> say<00:04:43.710> about<00:04:43.919> an

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
the solar cell they usually say about an

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.520 
the solar cell they usually say about an
average<00:04:44.520> of<00:04:44.699> 10<00:04:45.000> percent<00:04:45.389> but<00:04:46.050> there's<00:04:46.380> other

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
average of 10 percent but there's other

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.830 
average of 10 percent but there's other
variables<00:04:46.740> to<00:04:47.190> also<00:04:47.430> consider<00:04:47.610> I<00:04:48.090> started

this<00:04:48.990> video<00:04:49.590> in<00:04:50.070> the<00:04:50.250> morning<00:04:50.699> it<00:04:51.210> went

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 
this video in the morning it went

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:53.330 
this video in the morning it went
through<00:04:51.750> today<00:04:51.900> and<00:04:52.320> now<00:04:52.500> it's<00:04:52.740> early<00:04:53.010> evening

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
through today and now it's early evening

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.550 
through today and now it's early evening
so<00:04:54.000> the<00:04:54.120> sun's<00:04:54.330> not<00:04:54.600> quite<00:04:54.810> as<00:04:54.930> strong<00:04:55.229> so

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
so the sun's not quite as strong so

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.640 
so the sun's not quite as strong so
maybe<00:04:56.430> during<00:04:56.790> peak<00:04:57.060> hours<00:04:57.540> it<00:04:57.720> might<00:04:57.870> hit<00:04:58.050> 10%

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
maybe during peak hours it might hit 10%

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.150 
maybe during peak hours it might hit 10%
increase<00:04:59.130> if<00:04:59.729> I<00:04:59.850> measure<00:05:00.090> it<00:05:00.180> again<00:05:00.540> but<00:05:01.440> this

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
increase if I measure it again but this

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.090 
increase if I measure it again but this
goes<00:05:02.400> to<00:05:02.550> show<00:05:02.700> it's<00:05:03.060> not<00:05:03.419> fake<00:05:04.080> it's<00:05:04.590> not<00:05:04.770> the

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
goes to show it's not fake it's not the

actually<00:05:08.550> is<00:05:08.790> a<00:05:08.820> measurable<00:05:09.720> increase<00:05:09.930> in<00:05:10.500> the

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
actually is a measurable increase in the
