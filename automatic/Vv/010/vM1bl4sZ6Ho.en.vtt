 Mechanic he assembles even the heaviest wheels when building up 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.169
 however, he has to be very careful 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:15.609
 So these are special on Buchan won in the vehicle here 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.789
 So who can not be jacked up everywhere there are only certain points 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.460
 that are stable and that the way of the vehicle is so old 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.919
 missed under the slogan Point 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:29.229
 leave considerable damage to the vehicle lap is no longer reparable 

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:32.229
 Well then up with the car 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.550

 at the rim make a blessing that percent 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.120
 Percent that are relatively long complete and faster and so locks cents around 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.530
 The second thing is, of course, that the tires of the read times up and down 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.020
 of course, do not be spared only by doing cases 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.920
 Basically, the six are finished automatically also cheaper 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.440
 as that move 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.550

 Summer tires Winter tires or standing orders

 that also simply from emigration herald 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.820
 Once the council can be used again and again the pole 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.020
 Lawyers tires for summer and winter, however, are controversial 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.550
 These all-season tires of all-season tires 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.880
 Percent are always a compromise you should stop the cinema in city traffic 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.380
 use and drive me into the mountains a difference can be seen already 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.470
 At profile of Renter tires, these slats have the percent i put you in the 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.630
 Snow grip the all-season tires I see on white you can see that too 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.730
 Venter tire is significantly coarser and there is the fact that the 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.680
 Of course, rubber compounds are also different with all-season tires 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.460
 of course in summer 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.240
 Also have a good mileage again bring winter tires in the summer daily 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.940
 becomes 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.099
 If you look closely, you can easily recognize a real winter tire 

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:13.430
 So saving the winter is marked 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.040
 with the typical marking m &amp; s that means matte and snow and that 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.160
 additionally labeling in Europe to the tire manufacturers still this 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.139
 snowflake 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:25.419
 taken out of the tires to see exactly that these two marking 

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:29.129
 Denver winter tire statements and that are also important throughout the year 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:33.539
 Stripe at then he goes in principle, as the right Franc recognized it must 

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:36.579
 it may not necessarily be the expensive brand tire 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:39.109
 So it is important to determine the claim very much 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:42.519
 Albert already had to pay attention to the quality because high quality brand tires 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.719
 spare best mileage and have better grip old are cheap 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:50.339
 Mature the cheap tires in city traffic Masai which are also sufficient 

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:53.619
 There but already pay attention to the quality and the professional questions 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:59.269
 depending on the size of his car, the driver can change the tire 20 to 200 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:00.329
 Save Euro 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:01.890
 but no matter how expensive 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.309
 as far as use is mounted, others had to be stored fine 

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:09.019
 So it's important that I have the winter tires 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.290
 The stack with the rim to stack and lots of riding accident about none 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.719
 Cases have to adjust Nina 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:19.650
 the criminal also store at home one percent is important only that the wheels 

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:22.669
 dark and nothing to do with grease and oil 

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:26.489
 Balve Son irradiation is the biggest enemy of the tire 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:31.390
 a total of 3500 sets of tires are stored here 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.279
 That strikes me hard to drag the delivery rooms basement 

00:03:34.279 --> 00:03:37.199
 then the way would be better but better 

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:38.729
 he remains injured 

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:42.469
 for Laura the winter tires her a Beamer Waldsolms square forest 

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:43.869

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:46.229
 here by land to water and product safety 

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:48.179
 it is likely to be relocated 

00:03:48.179 --> 00:03:52.010
 Motorists who still want to retool should do it quickly 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.400
 because who waits until the first snow has to wait for long 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.150
 to adjust
