 hello people today is really the first one 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.950
 day of the 30 days because of incidents not 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.980
 we have already been in the evening 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:23.470

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.910
 the turning I have the first day so almost 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.560
 not a little behind 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.470
 eat salad because I do not have the money 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.330
 did turn with video and 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.790
 go before work and thus was 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.190
 bottle late shift that, however, not 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.920
 Normally you should yes from 19 o'clock 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.420
 eat nothing loud loud challenge goes around 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.640
 the book if you have not already 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:47.079
 really lose on Amazon if you 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:49.840
 you're so interested in what it does 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:52.510
 Today everything happened I got yesterday 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.940
 evening this book started to read 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.649
 and picked out the us concepts 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.649
 and me right after tomorrow 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:03.219
 getting up in the 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:06.130
 German biomarkets and has because of the 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:07.810
 necessary ingredients I worried for me 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.119
 breakfast lunch and dinner 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.799
 needs is not so made as 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.180
 Atila had recommended that 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:15.070
 namely, and should be right for the next 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.350
 pick out five days with recipes and 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.970
 go shopping for that we have 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.290
 Last night against nothing to later 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.210
 that's why I'm too complicated 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.210
 first manages the three recipes 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:30.810
 picked out and for the first ingredients 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:33.270
 bought that must then first impression 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.619
 pretty expensive 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.590
 second impressive after the order 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.150
 has cooked ingredients is yes you come 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.250
 but also believing for a long time 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.360
 I am curious how it is then 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.130
 end of the month will look like 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.440
 30 days what I took from it a woman 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.210
 they also say today I am 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.890
 for the underwear first so um 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.080
 got rid of 50 euros 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.220
 He was already for the next few days 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.540
 that's why I bought so basic ingredients 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.000
 time for me now so the rheiner 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.250
 I have a little something lying down 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.520
 so everything I bought was 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.200
 first, dm because at the dealer can 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.459
 you actually relatively cheap 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.650
 organic products buy bioliquids 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:18.580
 by eg purchase that one of us 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.920
 Alnatura Grand Masters are pure lack 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.110
 peeled and mashed seemingly zone must 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.290
 can already when court purely today 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.270
 I'll tell you right then 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.709
 bought for breakfast tomorrow or 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.810
 tomorrow no idea today there was 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.000
 then I also tell you very elegant 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.209
 not even that way anymore 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.110
 spelled franzis actually buys summer 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.250
 yes do not let manufacture take but 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.239
 somewhere, I thought to myself if you are fast 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:50.060
 Breakfast then rather the old culture 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.980
 then I checked her purchase amaranth 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.390
 the pack is almost done 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.910
 empty that was not quite so 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.930
 expensive i could already get a euro of 70 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.610
 or savored 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.310
 I'll give you the prices right away 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.350
 maybe even a look again 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:06.350
 how this fits so well on the myth 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.060
 to have that versatile but then I have 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.239
 I still bought here so a 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:15.739
 All in all, we are supporting our promotion 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:18.950
 dm 25 and become disembodied when afterwards 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:21.830
 still went to the biomarkt and got there 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.750
 I for example bought this caste the 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.730
 There was also about it at dm 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.440
 skimmed milk powder in it and that fits 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.570
 Of course, not so much the vegans anymore 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.350
 All together, for example 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.290
 Has 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.720
 bio supermarket bought david can too 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:39.080
 The Cocos radically bought breakfast 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:42.170
 but that succeeded already on the 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.390
 Cow course goal from the touchscreen to 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.820
 example there is now against us 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.860
 just 1 2 teaspoon needs you 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:53.360
 for this 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:56.900
 I think for lunch podcasts for 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:04:00.080
 Breakfast I'll show you this first 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.300
 photo tobis looks at massive pressure 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:06.250
 and now I'll show you for comparison 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:08.600
 the photo as it looked with us 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.450
 actually it would be similar so I found 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:14.780
 that comes very close to the picture bishop the glass 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:17.930
 it is not much of a race and pay 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:21.350
 yogurt with raspberry and amaranth 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.430
 Roasted coconut flakes have been very 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.740
 delicious 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.350
 But I also have to say that has 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:31.430
 The glass of wine is very much stuffed 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:33.860
 Ill was so big 16 years old 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.590
 Trivia of nokia around a little 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:40.970
 glass and that made me strong 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:45.020
 So totally delicious totally not sweet 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:46.610
 too cute but real so I have 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.380
 It did not make it up , I'm right there 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.990
 somehow still had to do such a piece 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.270
 two layers with raspberry and amaranth 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.460
 I do not have your world anymore 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.300
 We wanted to save for that 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:01.550
 Having lunch 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:08.570
 Cauliflower was immediately available for lunch 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:10.820
 Creek ranch this was delicious 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:13.990
 I really like cauliflower 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.990
 really like anyway 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.490
 i love it totally and indian cuisine 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.940
 that was really delicious the sauce 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.170
 So totally did not look creamy though he did 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:28.160
 no cream was on it 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:32.090
 there was only water and lack no need 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:35.650
 little pepper and salt and that 's it 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:38.060
 and just just fantastic spots 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.760
 hannover should be so full I should 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.380
 not everything has increased and 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.480
 even the 80 is no longer stuffed 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.520
 80 I had something from the breakfast on 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.960
 roma was no longer possible 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:55.810
 it's just familiar and familiar 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:06:00.160
 after that, white work has meanwhile 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:02.720
 Only green tea and cherry has been drinking 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:06.710
 Mixed there are also recipes with 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:09.860
 jerry green gary something means that is 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.630
 actually with mint recipe I think 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:15.350
 Unfortunately not so abundant now 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:16.850
 we again after if ye the 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.440
 Buying book yourself will become your trainer 

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:23.450
 that's why we are the only ones with church and 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:24.890
 Green tea was delicious you have to 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.780
 settle in a bit because I do that 

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:28.370
 could not chilled white again 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.860
 echoed that suggests because I have none 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:33.950
 work was is definitely a very 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:36.680
 good alternative to months that totally 

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:38.030
 contain a lot of sugar and somehow the 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.640
 teeth break we make my dentist 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:43.370
 put every nest and hopefully 

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:46.070
 This time it was not delicious anymore 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:47.450
 Immediately the salad and I am 

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.280
 I'm happy for the day I need 

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:49.940
 no chocolate or the first day 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.950
 was really good 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:54.290
