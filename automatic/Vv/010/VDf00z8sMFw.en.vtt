 Translator: Abd Al-Rahman Al-Azhurry Checker: ali alshalali 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:07.996
 You may not notice it 

00:00:07.996 --> 00:00:10.081
 But from the moment you left your bed today 

00:00:10.081 --> 00:00:12.697
 To the moment I sat down to watch this video 

00:00:12.697 --> 00:00:14.419
 I was swimming. 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:18.172
 Why ? Because the air is as liquid as water. 

00:00:18.172 --> 00:00:19.966
 Features waves and whirlpools. 

00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:21.050
 And flowing. 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.552
 And when the air is pushed away 

00:00:22.552 --> 00:00:24.803
 It leaves the effect of pushing around your. 

00:00:24.803 --> 00:00:27.391
 So why not notice it most of the time? 

00:00:27.391 --> 00:00:30.642
 Often we believe that the air is empty space. 

00:00:30.642 --> 00:00:33.812
 But one cubic cm of space is two stars 

00:00:33.812 --> 00:00:36.065
 Equivalent to pinky pin area 

00:00:36.065 --> 00:00:38.032
 Contains approximately one atom 

00:00:38.032 --> 00:00:43.197
 However, the same area of â€‹â€‹air contains a 10 quintillion molecule. 

00:00:43.197 --> 00:00:44.946
 If it is difficult for you to understand it 

00:00:44.946 --> 00:00:46.697
 It is equivalent 

00:00:46.697 --> 00:00:49.198
 The number of living insects in our planet 

00:00:49.198 --> 00:00:51.946
 They all crawl and climb and fly over each other 

00:00:51.946 --> 00:00:55.570
 In a large swarm packed. 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.838
 When this squadron collides with things 

00:00:57.838 --> 00:01:01.381
 It exercises pressure on the fluid boundary 

00:01:01.381 --> 00:01:04.676
 Like the water that presses on the wall of the bottle. 

00:01:04.676 --> 00:01:06.512
 This is known as air pressure. 

00:01:06.512 --> 00:01:08.226
 And while the air is lighter than water 

00:01:08.226 --> 00:01:10.557
 All these molecules become heavy 

00:01:10.557 --> 00:01:12.975
 In the total air that fills the school hall 

00:01:12.975 --> 00:01:15.771
 To weigh approximately the weight of an adult elephant. 

00:01:15.771 --> 00:01:17.727
 So when you enter a gym 

00:01:17.727 --> 00:01:19.394
 Why not collide directly 

00:01:19.394 --> 00:01:21.360
 The air bag in the room? 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.983
 Well, first 

00:01:22.983 --> 00:01:25.644
 Because most of it presses on the floor and walls 

00:01:25.644 --> 00:01:27.478
 And the part that presses you 

00:01:27.478 --> 00:01:30.978
 Push the pressure in you! 

00:01:30.978 --> 00:01:34.084
 As you see the air as well as water and all other things 

00:01:34.084 --> 00:01:36.999
 Which fills our bodies, are exercised as of pressure 

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:38.835
 Equal to the pressure of air outside. 

00:01:38.835 --> 00:01:40.838
 Of course this is not just a coincidence. 

00:01:40.838 --> 00:01:43.173
 This is precisely what allows us to stay 

00:01:43.173 --> 00:01:44.882
 In the normal atmosphere 

00:01:44.882 --> 00:01:46.395
 And making it more difficult 

00:01:46.395 --> 00:01:48.345
 In high places or in deep water. 

00:01:48.345 --> 00:01:50.846
 Usually we do not feel the pressure on us 

00:01:50.846 --> 00:01:52.648
 Because it is usually regular. 

00:01:52.648 --> 00:01:54.768
 Despite different amounts of air molecules 

00:01:54.768 --> 00:01:56.560
 Which collide with you at different times 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.227
 The air crowd will be very dense 

00:01:58.227 --> 00:02:01.107
 These differences are in varying degrees 

00:02:01.107 --> 00:02:03.777
 What happens when the air pressure is not regular? 

00:02:03.777 --> 00:02:06.279
 This means that the particles drive more 

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:08.600
 With more air than others 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.476
 Drive the airflow from the place of high pressure 

00:02:10.476 --> 00:02:12.144
 To low pressure place. 

00:02:12.144 --> 00:02:14.161
 We feel this flow directly in the wind 

00:02:14.161 --> 00:02:15.790
 Pressure systems 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.499
 Which meteorologists are always talking about 

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:19.960
 Which are responsible for other climate changes 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.922
 From the simplest to the most horrific. 

00:02:22.922 --> 00:02:24.590
 But differences in air pressure 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.001
 Lead to more things than make us complain of the weather 

00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:29.428
 Understanding the main reason we are alive. 

00:02:29.428 --> 00:02:32.061
 We breathe by reducing the pressure in our lungs 

00:02:32.061 --> 00:02:33.933
 Allowing the air to enter. 

00:02:33.933 --> 00:02:35.462
 So the next time you take a deep breath 

00:02:35.731 --> 00:02:38.522
 Remember that huge number of air molecules 

00:02:38.522 --> 00:02:40.311
 Which you are moving. 

00:02:40.311 --> 00:02:42.310
 Consider the night sky 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.478
 Think about the infinite space 

00:02:44.478 --> 00:02:46.310
 But unless you see this video 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.976
 From that deep space 

00:02:47.976 --> 00:02:49.533
 There are particles of air 

00:02:49.533 --> 00:02:51.144
 In your body and around it more 

00:02:51.144 --> 00:02:54.077
 Of the grains of sand in all the shores of the world and its desert 

00:02:54.077 --> 00:02:56.454
 And more stars in the visible universe 

00:02:56.454 --> 00:02:58.747
 Or more than merge the two numbers. 

00:02:58.747 --> 00:03:00.394
 The enormity of the universe 

00:03:00.394 --> 00:03:01.894
 In front of your eyes 

00:03:01.894 --> 00:03:04.004
 And your mind.
